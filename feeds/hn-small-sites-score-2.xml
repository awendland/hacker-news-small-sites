<p><a href="https://twitter.com/BadChinaTake">@BadChinaTake</a> is actually just a vehicle for ethnographic research needed to complete my second PhD. Yes, you did sign the Institutional Review Board waiver.</p>



<p>The following four broad categories are useful for anyone who wishes to navigate the cesspit of public opinion on the English-speaking Internet. While there are of course interdisciplinary individuals whose takes transcend categories, if not the very bounds of reason and logic, nevertheless, the following is sufficient as a primer to acquaint oneself with the varieties of garbage available to any aspiring to become a fabled China Watcher.</p>



<p>If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please keep them to yourself! I am very, very busy knowing things about China!</p>



<p><strong>Mystic China Knowers (MCKs)</strong></p>



<p><em>Examples: More or less any cultural consultant, Martin Jacques (who is also a tankie, detailed below, and does not even speak Chinese</em>)<em>, and really most people besides actual specialists in Eastern philosophy who insert quotes from Confucius</em> <em>into their writing</em></p>



<p>Most MCKs are not ethnically Chinese, BUT, they often have been to China and/or other places in the exciting <em>Sinosphere</em>, maybe for even up to a few years or more, and speak some Mandarin! Most often, though, theirs is of the mellifluous “<em>waw hway shwah zhawng-win</em>” variety, which they are entirely unaware of because the bar for non-native/heritage speakers (especially white ones) who learn Chinese is not low, it is just fully on the ground. MCKs are big fans of <strong>“phrenology for words,”</strong> an obnoxious genre of take based on an extremely superficial reading of some random Mandarin phrase, which they think they can divine like tea leaves with their HSK 3 level skills of cross-culture communication. For instance, from a consultant in India:</p>

<p><em>The notion of “goodbye” was indeed unheard of until brought to the subcontinent by the East India Trading Company and later to Qing China by the Royal Navy during the First Opium War</em>.<em> Everyone was just always, like, together before that</em>.</p>



<hr>



<p>From the relatively few MCKs whose attention spans and Mandarin reading ability  allow them progress from singular words or phrases into the realm of entire books, we get the “<strong>I once read this Chinese thing</strong>” subtype. Their genesis begins with the subject’s consumption of one, or maybe even a few, venerable Chinese texts. These texts might be a classic (probably read in translation, which is normally fine, unless you’re constructing a Unified Theory of China on it, in which case you need to suck it up and learn Classical Chinese). It might also be something like, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-07-05/is-the-u-s-in-a-new-cold-war-china-has-already-declared-it">I dunno, the Three Body Problem</a>, because that was on sale at Barnes &amp; Noble.</p>



<p>Whatever the text, upon consumption it renders unto the MCK a bounteous insight regarding literally anything you can think of about China and the Chinese; usually, this is also whatever topic is easiest to get placed in an op-ed or decent blog. Through feats of exegesis and interpretation that would put St. Augustine or Maimonides to shame, the MCK extracts meaning that, coincidentally, will also be critical for you to know if you want even the slightest chance of your line of spandex infant lederhosen to take off in Peking this fall. Their fee is $4,998.00 per briefing.</p>



<p>While rarer in the Twitterverse, there are certainly Chinese people whose views fall under the MCK category. One might argue that the Communist Party of China’s continued harping emphasizing 5,000 years of Chinese history puts it in this territory on occasion as well. (Archaeologist Michael Storozum has a good piece on why that claim relies on some pretty… liberal interpretations of what exactly constitutes a reliable historical record <a href="https://radiichina.com/china-5000-years-history/">here in Radii</a>.)</p>



<p><strong>Death 2 CCP Squad (D2CS)</strong></p>



<p><em>Examples: Rob Spalding, Chris Balding, Steve Bannon &amp; Miles Kwok, presumably all members of Committee on the Present Danger: China, management and most reporters of the Epoch Times</em></p>



<p>D2CS is to China as Dick Cheney and Paul Wolfowitz are to Iraq. They are <strong>the inverse of a Tankie</strong>, in way; China cannot do anything that is not a pernicious threat to the civilized world, freedom, love, beauty, and truth. The D2CS cheapen legitimate, pressing concerns about China on security, economic, and human rights fronts by instantly transforming any discussion thereof into a Manichaean battle of the Utterly Good United States et al. versus the People’s Republic of Evil and its ilk. Particularly noxious because of the influence many of them have in the US government at present (or <em>had,</em> before getting kicked out, in the cases of Spalding and Bannon.)</p>

<p>D2CS types are <strong>predominantly, but not exclusively, right-wing.</strong> Their backgrounds are diverse—some (like Miles Kwok a.k.a. Guo Wengui) were burned by Beijing and flipped their relatively mundane anger at losing everything they had in some power struggle into a self-righteous crusade; others (like Spalding) were spurned by some part of The Beltway establishment for being nincompoops and are convinced there is a conspiracy against all good patriots; and some are justifiably aggrieved Hong Kongers who have placed their hopes on the American right to deliver them, which, in all serious, really sucks to see. Then there’s the Epoch Times. Remember when their editorial board <a href="https://www.abc10.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/verify-unsolicited-paper-spreads-outlandish-covid-claims/103-9290495e-a501-44fa-b7df-0bb0e385328b">suggested</a> people afflicted with COVID-19 should consider denouncing Chinese Communist Ideology as a potential cure? Great crowd over there. Quality stuff.</p>



<p>The <strong>relatively small left-wing D2CS contingent</strong> seems to be primarily composed of Extremely Online pro-Taiwan independence advocates, the kind who make Tsai Ing-wen look like Chiang Ching-kuo. It’s not clear to me how many are even Taiwanese. Their wrath also stems from kernels of concern about the security and wellbeing of the place they genuinely have come to love, but frankly, it just gets cringey, and they seem to lack an understanding that their rhetoric is frequently appropriated by the right to advocate for hawkish policy that if anything may put <em>more </em>Taiwanese people in danger.</p>



<p><strong>Tankies</strong></p>



<p><em>Examples: Employees of </em>Grayzone<em> (especially editor <a href="https://twitter.com/BenjaminNorton?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Ben</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/BenjaminNorton">Norton)</a>, the <a href="https://twitter.com/qiaocollective">Qiao <s>Beehive</s> Collective</a>, and upwards of 90% of people with ☭ in their Twitter display name)</em></p>



<p>A classic type whose name is derived from the Soviet tanks that rolled through either Czechoslovakia in 1969, Hungary in 1956, or even the tanks at Tiananmen Square in 1989, depending on who you ask. The Tankie is an unapologetic Western apologist for authoritarian violence and repression regularly deployed by the CCP against dissidents and activists it deems a threat to Party rule. The tankie will probably tell you those dissident and activists were counterrevolutionaries anyway. Many appear to be literal teenagers, which is telling.</p>



<p>Through extremely ahistorical and elementary readings of a smorgasbord of left-wing texts, or at least the screenshots of said texts they see on Twitter, Tankies collate around an “<strong>Identity Politics for Stalinists,” </strong>a ludicrous worldview the functionally renders the very idea of imperial colonialism exclusively to the domain of white-majority countries (except the USSR, of course, which was not imperialist, and Hong Kong democracy protestors, who are, because one of the waved a Union Jack that one time) and by extension does not countenance the idea that China could ever engage in similar offenses. Interestingly, there are degrees of Tankie-ism, or in other words, there are some Tankies that are too Tankie even for other Tankies:</p>

Kim Jong-un is just misunderstood.  It’s all very charming.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Politically, they are much less powerful on the whole than the most prominent D2CS type, probably because they are too obnoxious to be around in real life, making organizing grassroots actions hard. Yet they are subtly pernicious in that their presence is extremely corrosive for the left writ large; if I’m a Ukrainian-American at my first New York DSA meeting, I’m going to get pretty pissed when someone gets up and tells me my <em>babusya’s</em> death was actually faked for CIA agitprop or whatever. Ditto re: any Hong Konger who might otherwise organize on the left (speaking of which, shout out to <a href="https://lausan.hk/">Lausan</a> , which everyone should read).</p>



<p>Indeed, the tell-tale sign of Tankie-ism is the belief that the CIA/other Western intelligence agencies are several orders of magnitude more effective, discrete, and competent than they actually are, which is probably pretty embarrassing for the CIA. Another tell-tale sign is just views of history that sound like they come from a weird fairytale:</p>

<p><strong>CCP Bootlickers</strong></p>



<p><em>Examples: <a href="https://twitter.com/CarlZha">Carl Zha</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/shaunrein">Shaun Rein</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Tom_Fowdy">Tom Fowdy</a>, that one fratbro you studied abroad in Shanghai with for a semester and who really hit it off with the nephew of the Deputy Chair of the District Party Committee when you all went out clubbing once and then decided he was never going back to Arkansas, ever</em>,<em> because this place is great</em></p>



<p>Unlike Tankies, the Bootlicker is not convincingly Marxist, although they may nominally claim to be for the sake of convenience. They prefer to expound upon the superiority of the People’s Republic in more platitudinous terms, like pictures of ethnic minorities dancing happily. They generally have direct experience living and working in China, or are from there themselves, which helps explain why they are not real Marxists, because if they were, they might get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasic_incident">steamrolled by the CCP</a>. In reality, the bootlickers just subscribe the what may be termed <strong>“Socialism with Suck-up Characteristics.”</strong></p>



<p>The Bootlicker can be driven by any combination of motives, such as financial interest in China, nationalism, and/or contrarianism. For Shaun Rein, for instance, it appears to be a combination of all three. There’s also the fact that his mother-in-law is the daughter Marshal Ye Jianying, who was a member of the CCP Politburo in the 1970s and 80s. </p>

Two-way Binding for Custom Components</a></h2><blockquote><p>Allows a custom component to customize the prop and event used when it’s used with v-model. By default, v-model on a component uses value as the prop and input as the event, but some input types such as checkboxes and radio buttons may want to use the value prop for a different purpose. Using the model option can avoid the conflict in such cases.</p></blockquote><p><code>v-model</code> is well-known for two-way binding. <code>input</code> is the default update event. The value can be updated via <code>$emit</code>. The only limitation is that the component needs an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> tag to bind with the <code>value</code> prop.</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>my-checkbox</span> <span>v-model</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>val<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>my-checkbox</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>template</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

Different to <code>v-model</code>, it doesn't require your component to have an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> tag and bind the value to it. It only triggers <code>update:&lt;your_prop&gt;</code> to mutate the prop via event system.</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>custom-component</span> <span>:value.sync</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>value<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre><h2 id="7-component-lifecycle-hook"><a href="#7-component-lifecycle-hook">7.

<h2>Fair Use and Exigent Circumstances</h2>



<p>

*<em>The opinions and scholarship communicated on this website are the author’s own, expressed in his personal capacity.*</em></p>



<p>If you work in any of the higher ed institutions that are preparing to move online – maybe your copyright world has exploded in a range of questions on fair use, e-reserves, online access, scanning, digitization, and more! I am sure many of you, especially in the library community, are working towards the best solution for students, faculty, staff, and patrons in this time of crisis. </p>



<p>To help you navigate this process, over the next few posts  (working as I go) I will offer reminders of all the super awesome legal tools libraries have for copyright as “stewards of access” in our communities.</p>



<p>As I have often messaged, libraries and archives have “superpowers” under the copyright law that allows us to supply our communities with access to materials for research, scholarship, and study. Most notably, these statutory exemptions were granted to libraries and archives by Congress to ensure our continued public mission. Further, libraries can utilize technology to <em>enhance</em> access to materials. Adapting and utilizing technology for the benefit of our patrons is something that libraries and archives have been successful at for decades – from the first photocopiers in libraries, microfiche, computer labs,  to 3-D printers! </p>



<p>So, in times like this COVID-19 crisis, let’s continue to harness both law and technology to help!</p>



<p>Before I get to the TEACH Act, Section 108, or any other superpower – first and foremost, we must talk about <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107">fair use</a>. While this isn’t a library superpower – <strong>fair use is for everyone!</strong> – it certainly falls to the libraries and archives, in many circumstances, to be the champions of fair use on campus (and bust any fair use myths!)</p>



<figure><img src="https://kylecourtney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Fair-Use-Rosie-1024x557.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://kylecourtney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Fair-Use-Rosie-1024x557.jpg 1024w, https://kylecourtney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Fair-Use-Rosie-300x163.jpg 300w, https://kylecourtney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Fair-Use-Rosie-768x418.jpg 768w, https://kylecourtney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Fair-Use-Rosie.jpg 1409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>In questions I’ve received, tweets I’ve been following, and posts to the Copyright First Responders lists about libraries’ responses to COVID-19, what is pervasive is the sense that this isn’t a normal “par for the course” moment. These are exigent circumstances with a limited timeline, and we, as libraries, have a strong mission and public purpose. In response to the COVID-19 public health crisis and ensuing campus closures, we can make use of the “release valve” that fair use offers. We have a lot of space to support our communities in this moment as long as we’re being thoughtful, <em>providing good copyright information when asked</em>, and limiting our activities to the&nbsp;specific, <em>time-bound needs</em> of instructors and students for the rest of the semester. In doing so, we are applying fair use prudently and managing risk sensibly. We are not crafting permanent policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortunately, copyright law does not always restrict uses. In many cases a solid understanding of fair use can help ease fears, provide legal alternatives to a particular request, or help educate the higher education community at large. </p>



<p>Again, as long as we’re being thoughtful, <em>providing good copyright information when asked</em>, and limiting our activities to the&nbsp;specific, <em>time-bound needs</em> of our communities for the rest of this timeline, we are in a good place to have a strong fair use analysis. <br></p>



<p>Yes, we are still applying fair use prudently and managing risk sensibly, but we can do that and clearly meet our user’s needs!  </p>



<p>Just to be clear: Fair use is a flexible limitation on copyright which states “Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106” (the copyright owner’s rights) “the fair use of a copyrighted work…for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research” is not an infringement of copyright. And then we are given the famous four-factor test to make that risk determination.</p>



<p>Again, let me emphasize “<strong>flexible!</strong>” Fair use is flexible and, as the Supreme Court stated in<em> <a href="https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/assets/files/2LiveCrew.pdf">Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.</a></em><a href="https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/assets/files/2LiveCrew.pdf">, 510 U.S. 569 (1994)</a> “permits and requires courts to avoid rigid application of the copyright statute.” So, if fair use is found, it is, according to the Copyright Act, “not an infringement of copyright.”</p>



<p>The
mechanics underpinning fair use were codified in the Copyright Act with the
famous four factors: 1) the purpose and character of the use, 2) the nature of
the work copied, 3) the amount and substantiality of the work used, and 4) the
effect on the market for the original. One has to examine all four factors for
each individual use to make a fair use determination. </p>



<p>For
the purposes of this blog post, let’s explore a fictional request to scan some
materials for a class that is forced to move to online as a result of a
COVID-19 closure. Below we will make our way through each of the four factors with
an eye to ask some questions and gain an understanding of making a fair use determination
for this sort of scenario.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://kylecourtney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/fair-use-four.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://kylecourtney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/fair-use-four.jpg 296w, https://kylecourtney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/fair-use-four-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 296px) 100vw, 296px"></figure></div>



<p><strong>Fair Use Factor One – Purpose and Character:</strong> The first fair use factor, “purpose and character of the use,” is illustrated by the examples that is part of the fair use statute preamble: <em>criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship or research.</em> Clearly our colleagues working at non-profit educational institutions have a good start for a fair use determination right away. Our use is clearly for the benefit of research and education!  </p>



<p>Additionally, let’s put this first factor in the context of the COVID-19 closure scenario. Well, this particular “purpose” is allowing faculty and students to access the materials they need in a public emergency where they are facing quarantines, social distancing, or campus/library closures. This is strong evidence, I believe, for favoring fair use in the “purpose and character” factor. </p>



<p><strong>Fair Use Factor Two – Nature of Copyrighted Work:</strong> </p>



<p>When
determining whether our COVID-19-related scanning request is a fair use under
the second factor, we must ask ourselves a couple of questions about the work
at hand: Is it published or unpublished; and how “creative” is the original
work?</p>



<p>While
the law is more protective of unpublished work, because authors have right to
decide whether and when they will make their work public, courts have largely
ignored this factor, with some calling it “neutral” in many recent decisions.
Certainly, many higher ed courses use both factual works and creative works.</p>



<p>Certainly do not see this factor as dispositive of the entire fair use test – let’s move forward to the next factor!</p>



<p><strong>Fair Use Factor Three – Amount and Substantiality Used:</strong> The third factor receives major discussion in both court cases and scholarship surrounding fair use. A common question that examines this factor derives directly from the critical facts in most fair use cases: <em>How much is being used?</em> If it’s a smaller amount of a copyrighted work, it favors fair use. But what about a request for an entire work?</p>



<p><strong>Well, despite any myths you may have heard, it can be fair to use an entire work</strong>. However, it must be a justified fair use. The important thing to remember is that the law favors using the right amount necessary to serve the users purpose. There are no bright lines when it comes to what percentage of the copyrighted work is too much and typically, the higher the percentage, the more likely this factor is to count against fair use.</p>



<p>However, let’s apply this to a new common COVID-19 scenario: The use of a book when the campus moves online. Maybe we consider that we do not scan the whole textbook, unless it is absolutely necessary. And it may be absolutely necessary! And it also may not be! The factor is assessed based on the facts of the scenario.</p>



<p>For example, a class may have already covered Chapters 1-7 for the first part of the semester – and now, moving online, they need chapters 8, 9, 10, and 11 to finished out the semester. The library may have used fair use analysis to tailored this request to the needs of the faculty and students. This action is employing part of the fair use rationale that states that one should use only the amount necessary to serve the purpose.</p>



<p>The syllabus certainly helps with calculating the need and amount used. I have observed recommendations making materials available to students that are measured by the class syllabus <strong>from the “move online” moment </strong>to the<strong> end of the semester.</strong> Now, that might be more than any library policy “rules of thumb” that normally exist. But again, this is not the normal policy – and wouldn’t be representative of the factual scenarios we are being presented with now with the COVD-19 crisis. Fair use decisions are rendered case-by-case, thankfully, and we can look to amount needed as necessary to serve the purpose.</p>



<p>Now, here’s another novel issue. What if the student needs access to the book for studying for the final test? Chapters 1-7, which were previously only available on reserve (or left behind in the abandoned dorm room) are now inaccessible. Can we expand the digitization request beyond chapters 8, 9, 10, and 11 to finished out the semester ? Again, we have to look at the limited use, timing, and exigent circumstances of this scenario. Use the same standard as always used under factor three: <em>the use should use only copy the amount necessary to serve the purpose </em></p>



<p><strong>Fair Use Factor Four – Market Effect:</strong> This is another factor that gets a lot of discussion both in the fair use court cases and commentary. The question often revolves around whether the proposed use will cut into the potential market or value of the work. And we have seen court cases stating that using a copyrighted work in a way that means lost sales to the copyright owner will weigh against fair use.</p>

July 24, 2020 | https://maxkostinevich.com/blog/serverless-geolocation/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://maxkostinevich.com/blog/serverless-geolocation/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
        <p>If you ever tried to make a Geo-location service (e.g. define a user country based on user IP address), most likely you heard about <a href="https://www.maxmind.com/">MaxMind</a>. </p>
<p>MaxMind - is probably one of best companies who provides Geo IP databases and services. </p>
<p>However, there is a number of limitations: if you're making a side-project, most likely you do not want to pay extra $$$ for geolocation services. And for this case MaxMind offers GeoLite2 database, however you'll be in charge of hosting this database on your server and making regular updates of the database. You also need to make sure your project is compliant with MaxMind's License.</p>
<h2>Why to use Cloudflare Workers instead of AWS Lambda?</h2>
<p>In this particular example, I needed a simple geo-location service which will be used in embeddable javascript code (similar to Google Analytics or other tracking service), so the response time is quite crucial.</p>
<p>In my first attempt I tried to use Serverless framework to host simple geo-location function on AWS Lambda (this function uses MaxMind GeoLite2 database). However, I quickly realized that the response time isn't what I've expected - on average the response took somewhere between from 200ms to 500ms. So I started looking for other options.  </p>
<p>So, I thought - if I could not host it on AWS Lambda, where else I could host my serverless function? The next service I tried - is <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Workers</a>. I created a simple function to test the reponse time, and it was really impressive - on average it was between from 30ms to 80ms, I've got almost x10 better performance in comparison to AWS. </p>
<p>However, this solution had one really big caveat - MaxMind GeoLite2 database does not work on Cloudflare Workers due to some runtime limitations.</p>
<h2>MaxMind alternative</h2>
<p>And then I thought - hey, wait a second, as Cloudflare provides DDoS protection services, they might provide some interesting features in Cloudflare Workers. And after exploring their documentation, I realized that the <code>Request</code> object in function have an access to <code>cf</code> object, which contains some useful information about the visitor, including visitor's country!</p>
<p>That's exactly what I was looking for, within a few dozens of lines of code I got my geolocation function up and running.</p>
<h2>The source code</h2>
<p>If you haven't worked with Cloudflare before, you need to signup at <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare.com</a> and go to Workers directory.</p>
<p>Then, create a new worker with the following source code:</p>

<p>Then you can start making requests to your Worker's endpoint.</p>    </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>Since the GPT-3's demos have stormed Twitter, more and more devs are getting anxious about how this would affect their jobs in the future. I think the tweet that has struck the developers the most is the one by Sharif Shameen</p>

<p>If anyone can create UI and generate React code just by describing it in plain English, why would any company hire a Frontend Developer anymore? </p>
<p>Let's start by getting a little more context about GPT-3</p>
<h2 id="what-is-gpt-3-">What is GPT-3?</h2>

<p><strong>Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) — 3,</strong> in simple words, is a pre-trained model that can explore the internet for answers and generate responses in a contextual way. This is why it is able to start giving predictions even when provided with a small input. You can check out Paul's demo for more context.</p>

<h2 id="how-gpt-3-will-help-evolve-your-jobs-rather-than-taking-it">How GPT-3 will help evolve your jobs rather than taking it</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"With Products like <a href="http://debuild.co/" target="_blank">debuild.co</a>, should we even bother learning Frontend development?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fear of AI taking on all our jobs has been the topic of discussion for years now, and since GPT-3, developers are able to see this happening to them sooner than later.  This is the same situation when people were of the impression that firebase will kill backend jobs, and products like Netlify and Vercel will kill Cloud engineering jobs, but on the contrary, all these services have played a role in increasing the job market. It has been empowering more and more startups to rise up with low initial investment, and these startups in turn hire more engineers when they want to scale up.</p>
<p>In my opinion, one should consider GPT-3 to be the milestone in AI which will lead us to the next evolution of the way we work. </p>

<h2 id="the-concept-of-priming-in-gpt-3-models">The Concept of Priming in GPT-3 models</h2>
<p>The biggest reason why GPT-3 is a potential game-changer in AI tech is that anyone can use this without having to find a dataset for the ML to start predicting as expected, few inputs will help you get exceptional results. That being said the quality of input is definitely a factor for the results that you get. This is where the concept of priming comes up. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Priming is giving the model a series of input and expected outputs which should be easy for the model to calculate context and create a guide for itself for future inputs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I highly recommend you to look into <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://medium.com/@IntuitMachine">Carlos' pieces</a> if you want to dive deeper into how priming works starting from the one mentioned below</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://medium.com/intuitionmachine/the-subtle-art-of-priming-gpt-3-bc12f67c9777">The Subtle Art of Priming GPT-3</a></p>
<p>According to the material that is out there as of now, it seems that using GPT-3, it would become extremely easy to create a super tool for a niche use-case, but there is still time for it to be mature enough to replace a whole field of work. </p>

<p>You can follow Swyx's repo to be up to date with all things GPT-3</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/sw-yx/gpt3-list">sw-yx/gpt3-list</a></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>GPT-3 is the closest we can get to have something like Jarvis from Iron man so that should be something that can be exciting</p>
<p>I think the best way to handle this new progress in AI is to sit tight and be curious about how this can change the way developers would be building products in the future.</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: This blog is all written without any help of GPT-3</em> 😂</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I am waiting for my GPT beta invite like:

<blockquote>LinkedIn profiles have become a powerful place to gather data on individuals. Different parties will have their own usage of LinkedIn profiles, such as LinkedIn data mining, profile research or leads generation.</blockquote><p>There are many methods out there to procure the information we need. In this tutorial, we’ll be using one of the more simple ways to obtain the data we need, which is to use <strong>Python</strong> to simulate a Google search and get ahold of the URLs returned from the search results. Further processing can be done, either manually or via automation, as we discuss in our other tutorial, <a href="https://nubela.co/blog/tutorial-how-to-build-linkedin-automation-tools-with-python-with-a-code-example/">How to Build LinkedIn Automation Tools with Python With a Code Example</a>.</p><p>The main reason for this is to get familiar with one of the most common methods of web scraping, which is browser-based scraping. For those unfamiliar, this is where we simulate human behaviour on the web by using a browser. We will utilize a tool called <strong>Selenium</strong>, which is an open-source testing framework for web applications, which allows us to start a browser through the script. Its usage goes far beyond testing, however, as we will soon demonstrate.</p><h3 id="setup-">Setup:</h3><p>Before we start, we need to set up the project and download the dependencies we need:</p><ol><li>Python 3</li><li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/selenium/"><code>selenium library</code> with chrome webdriver</a></li></ol><h3 id="step-1">Step 1</h3><p>Let’s simulate a Google search. We will be making use of one of the more unknown Google search features, which is Google search operators, also referred to as advanced operators. These are special characters and commands that help to provide a more strict criterion for our search term, hence narrowing down our search results. You can read <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/">here</a> for a comprehensive list of operators.</p><pre><code>def create_search_url(title, location, *include):
    result = ""
    base_url = "http://www.google.com/search?q=+-intitle:%22profiles%22+site:linkedin.com/in/+OR+site:linkedin.com/pub/"

    quote = lambda x: "%22" + x + "%22"

    result += base_url
    result += quote(title) + "+" + quote(location)

    for word in include:
        result += "+" + quote(word)

    return result
</code></pre><p>We first start by defining our base URL. As you can see, there are search operators already present. The <code>-intitle</code> operator tells the engine to find pages with the word 'profiles' in the title tag. We also use the <code>-inurl</code> operator to ensure we only want pages with LinkedIn profile URLs. We can specify the default profile URLs that starts with <code>linkedin.com/pub/</code> or personalised URLs that start with <code>linkedin.com/in/</code> using the <code>OR</code> operator.</p><p>Then, we narrow our search even more by using double quotation marks to use exact-matching. Since we can’t enter double quotations in a Python string, we should either use the escape character (“\”) before the quotes or use the Unicode-equivalent in the URL which is <code>%22</code>. We enter the desired title/position and the country we passed as arguments into the quotes. To make our function less rigid, we allow additional arguments if you want to specify more criteria. Anything passed as <code>include</code> will be added for exact matching.</p><p>You can test this function yourself by printing out the result and pasting that result in your browser search bar. You can actually generate more specific Google search URLs by using free online tools like <a href="https://recruitin.net/">Recruit’em XRay Search</a>.</p><h3 id="step-2">Step 2</h3><p>Now we will make use of Selenium’s WebDriver to spin up our own automated browser. We can use any of the browsers supported by Selenium (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, etc), but for now, we will use Chrome. Here we can also specify if we want to run this browser in headless mode, which is to say without the browser window popping up (no GUI), by adding <code>options.add_argument('headless')</code>.</p><pre><code>max_page = 5
all_urls = []

options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
# options.add_argument('headless')

# specifies the path to the chromedriver.exe
driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=options)

# always start from page 1
page = 1

driver.get(create_search_url("software engineer", "singapore", "developer", "nubela"))

while True:
    time.sleep(3)

    # find the urls
    urls = driver.find_elements_by_class_name('r')
    urls = [url.find_element_by_tag_name('a') for url in urls]
    urls = [url.get_attribute("href") for url in urls]
    all_urls = all_urls + urls

    # move to the next page
    page += 1

    if page &gt; max_page:
        print('\n end at page:' + str(page - 1))
        break

    try:
        next_page = driver.find_element_by_css_selector("a[aria-label='Page " + str(page) + "']")
        next_page.click()
    except:
        print('\n end at page:' + str(page - 1) + ' (last page)')
        break

print(all_urls)
</code></pre><p>We then navigate to the URL returned by the previous function using <code>driver.get()</code>. This will open the page on the browser. Then it's time to get our hands on the profile URLs that are on this page of Google. We can use the browser 'Inspect' developer tool to see the HTML tag of the page links. For every link on the page, the class name of the HTML <code>div</code> will be <code>r</code>. As per convention, the hyperlink, or the profile URL, will be embedded within the <code>hrefs</code> attribute of the <code>a</code> tag.</p><p>Every time we finish scraping the Google page for URLs, we navigate to the next page by finding the button using <code>driver.find_element_by_css_selector()</code> and simulating a click action. Here we specified a counter for the number of pages and a maximum page which you can set a reasonable number for. If the next page doesn't exist, then we stop our crawling and return our results.</p><h3 id="additional-steps">Additional steps</h3><p>You have now obtained the LinkedIn profile URLs that you need.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Open source has been intertwined with enterprise software for more than two decades and, with the increased adoption of cloud computing, the role of open-source software has only been increasing. If we look at the hype around containers, it is completely driven by open source. As <a href="https://talkingserverless.com/serverless/">Serverless</a> gains traction, driven mainly by the higher-level abstractions, the key question in the minds of industry watchers. When the underlying nuts and bolts have limited meaning from the point of view of its end users, does open source have any meaning? Do developers even care about open source?</p>



<p>When cloud computing gained traction, driven by the success of AWS, there were questions about the viability of open-source software. We had open source projects like OpenStack, CloudStack, and Eucalyptus, competing against the Infrastructure as a Service offering from AWS. They failed miserably because the advantage of cloud computing was in the outsourcing of data center capital expenditure and operations. Open-source IaaS software didn’t provide this advantage and all they could offer was better resource utilization and programmatic access to the infrastructure. However, in the early days of cloud computing, the public cloud was not a runaway success among enterprise customers and the hybrid cloud was the path taken by these users.</p>



<p>Even though open source failed in providing an equivalent to AWS EC2, we saw the reverse happening in the PaaS layer. While Heroku, Google App Engine stagnated after getting initial developer mindshare, OSS offerings like OpenShift and CloudFoundry gained developer traction as well as enterprise adoption. Their success could be adopted to the fact that enterprise customers wanted to have a PaaS like abstraction that could span both on-premises as well as public cloud. This was followed by the huge success of Docker as the container engine and Kubernetes as the container orchestration plane. At this point, talking heads were so confident about the importance of OSS in cloud computing. But we need to keep in mind that the success of OSS in the PaaS layer was driven by two main reasons:</p>



<ul><li>PaaS services in the public cloud had a legacy cost structure based on compute units similar to virtual machines</li><li>Hybrid cloud was still the focus of enterprise customers due to unnecessary concerns about moving to public cloud providers</li></ul>



<p>In the last 2-3 years, we have seen a dramatic shift in the enterprise adoption of public clouds and most organizations are taking a cloud-first approach.</p>



<p>So, when AWS released AWS Lambda with a new pricing model based on service invocations, we saw a shift similar in importance to what happened when they released compute and storage as a service with a pricing model where user paid only when the service was used. Functions as a Service (FaaS) like AWS Lambda, <a href="https://go.zoho.com/yIl">Catalyst</a>, Azure Functions, etc. provide a breakthrough in the cost model similar to the pay per use model unleashed by early cloud services like AWS S3 and EC2. This is what makes FaaS uniquely attractive to both developers and enterprises. A fundamental shift in a cost structure that lowers the barrier to adoption and the cost of innovation. FaaS levels the playing field for smaller companies to build innovative services to compete with large organizations with great financial muscle. This is entirely driven by the cost model of FaaS alone and the cost savings are the reason why FaaS is still attractive in spite of certain architectural limitations imposed by the abstraction.</p>



<p>The key question is whether open-source can compete with FaaS offerings in the cloud. There is no straightforward binary answer and it is a bit more nuanced. OSS cannot compete head to head with FaaS. Developers would rather not have any operational overhead than managing the open-source serverless layer. FaaS is a clear winner against open source equivalents just like how IaaS made open-source cloud infrastructure software irrelevant. However, open-source may still be important in some niche areas:</p>



<ul><li>There could be higher-order developer frameworks on top of FaaS that could be open source in order to get developer mindshare. Serverless.com is a good example of this</li><li>Multi-cloud is fast becoming the de facto strategy for many organizations. Organizations may want to provide the same developer abstractions across multiple cloud providers. Open source serverless platforms will be relevant in this scenario. Data is spread out among multiple cloud providers and the compute for the applications using the data should lie closer to the data. Many organizations may want to provide a standardized developer interface to their developers. Open source serverless platforms will be useful in such scenarios. This is similar to the success of OpenShift and, to a lesser extent, CloudFoundry in the PaaS layer</li><li>Kubernetes is fast gaining traction among the enterprises for deploying containers. As organizations deploy apps using multiple encapsulations and deployment models like containers and FaaS, they may want to have a Kubernetes based serverless layer. Knative and serverless frameworks on top of Knative may be relevant in such scenarios</li></ul>



<p>While it doesn’t make sense to use an open-source FaaS layer while using a single cloud provider for deploying the applications, it may still be relevant in multi-cloud scenarios and toolkits around FaaS. Thoughts?</p>

leave a star if you learn something from it! <a href="https://github.com/sergiotapia/torrentinim">https://github.com/sergiotapia/torrentinim</a></p></blockquote><p>Let’s create a simple type called <code>Torrent</code> to keep the data we crawl in
a nice object.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="nim"><span>import</span> times

    <p>
      Few days ago I was browsing HN and found an article about how fire is implemented in DOOM
      <a href="http://fabiensanglard.net/doom_fire_psx/">http://fabiensanglard.net/doom_fire_psx/</a>. It’s very simple and the result is surprisingly good. I cannot stop but trying to
      implemented in JavaScript right away. I managed to get it working and added some extra
      controls. Since I found the original article still need a bit digestion to understand. I want
      to talk about how it is implemented in my own (hopefully even simpler) words.
    </p>
    <h2><a id="The_Basic_4"></a>The Basic</h2>
    <p>
      To make fire in a pixel grid, the basic idea is that, we traverse each pixel and update each
      pixel above them to be “cooler”. And we do it over and over again. This way, if we set all
      bottom line of pixels to “hottest”. we can see just sit and let it grow up. Like this:
    </p>

    

    <p>If we make it bigger and put fire's color on it, based on the number. It looks like this.</p>

    

    <h2><a id="The_Trick_16"></a>The Trick</h2>
    <p>
      But that doesn’t really look like fire, it’s too “linear”. The trick to make it look like fire
      is adding some randomness on how the fire “grow” up.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, instead of always make the above pixel “cooler”, we only do it by 50% chance. So 50%
      chance the above pixel will be cooler, and 50% the above pixel won't change. It looks like
      this:
    </p>

    

    <p>
      It looks better. Next, when we look for the above pixel, instead of going straight up, we can
      add a shift to left or right randomly. In code, when we traverse each pixel, find the pixel
      above, then either, update that pixel, or update the one on its left, or update the one on its
      right. The result looks like this:
    </p>

    

    <p>
      Now it starts to look like fire. Let's try to add more pixels and render it on canvas instead
      of HTML to get a better performance. We will also get ride of the pixel border and number.
    </p>

    

    <h2><a id="Control_fire_34"></a>Control fire</h2>
    <h3><a id="wind_36"></a>wind</h3>
    <p>
      In the original article, the author left an exercise for readers to simulate wind. If you get
      the idea how the fire is generated, it’s pretty straight forward to know wind can be
      simulated. All we need to do adjust the shift of left or right when update the above pixel. If
      we shift more to the left, it will cause the pixel leaning toward left, which makes it look
      like there is a wind blow from right to left. And the same goes to the other way.

    <h3><a id="Fade_the_fire_40"></a>Fade the fire</h3>
    <p>
      Fading the fire can be simulated by gradually updating the bottom section of the pixel to be
      “cooler”. It will not only “fade” the bottom section but also “fade” all the pixels above,
      because they are propagated.
    </p>
    <h3><a id="fire_intensity_44"></a>fire intensity</h3>
    <p>
      Fire intensity basically means how long does it take for a pixel to get “cool down” as it
      propagates up. Currently, we set it to be 50% chance to cool down. So if we want the fire to
      be more “intense”, we just need to make let less possible to cool down.

    <p>You can try to control the fire here:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>(This is an adaptation of a talk I gave at PyCon and DevDay. <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/hackflow/why-underscore">Slides</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGAC6ftYUS0#t=12100">video</a> are available in russian)</em></p>

<p>Do you know what <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">underscore</a> is? In its most general it’s a JavaScript library that makes life better. For whoever writes in JavaScript. I mostly write Python and I also wanted my life better, so I went ahead and wrote <a href="https://github.com/Suor/funcy">a similar library for Python</a>. But the thing is you need to understand a magic behind something to properly replicate it. So what’s the magic behind _?</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>To answer this question we should look at problems this kind of libraries solve. To get some ground I’ll illustrate them with code. That will be in python, but all the ideas are universal, so don’t be afraid.</p>

<h3>A piece of entangled code</h3>

<p>This messy piece of code was taken from a real project and slightly simplified:</p>

<div>
<figure><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span>
<span>2</span>
<span>3</span>
<span>4</span>
<span>5</span>
<span>6</span>
<span>7</span>
<span>8</span>
<span>9</span>
</pre></td><td><pre><code><span><span>images</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
</span><span><span>for</span> <span>url</span> <span>in</span> <span>urls</span><span>:</span>
</span><span>    <span>for</span> <span>attempt</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>DOWNLOAD_TRIES</span><span>):</span>
</span><span>        <span>try</span><span>:</span>
</span><span>            <span>images</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>download_image</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>))</span>
</span><span>            <span>break</span>
</span><span>        <span>except</span> <span>HttpError</span><span>:</span>
</span><span>            <span>if</span> <span>attempt</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>==</span> <span>DOWNLOAD_TRIES</span><span>:</span>
</span><span>                <span>raise</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>
</div>


<p>There are several things entangled in here, but my point is that this could be written much shorter:</p>

<div>
<figure><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span>
<span>2</span>
</pre></td><td><pre><code><span><span>http_retry</span> <span>=</span> <span>retry</span><span>(</span><span>DOWNLOAD_TRIES</span><span>,</span> <span>HttpError</span><span>)</span>
</span><span><span>images</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>http_retry</span><span>(</span><span>download_image</span><span>),</span> <span>urls</span><span>)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>
</div>


<p>If it seems hard at first, then it’s okay. It involves some functions and <a href="http://hackflow.com/blog/2013/10/08/abstracting-control-flow/">control flow abstractions</a> most probably new to you. Once you get used to it you’ll find that the latter variant is not only shorter, but is also simpler.</p>

<h3>Dirty dictionary</h3>

<p>But let’s go on and clean some dirty dictionary:</p>

<div>
<figure><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span>
<span>2</span>
<span>3</span>
<span>4</span>
<span>5</span>
<span>6</span>
</pre></td><td><pre><code><span><span>d</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
</span><span><span>for</span> <span>k</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span> <span>in</span> <span>request</span><span>.</span><span>items</span><span>():</span>
</span><span>    <span>try</span><span>:</span>
</span><span>        <span>d</span><span>[</span><span>k</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>int</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>)</span>
</span><span>    <span>except</span> <span>(</span><span>TypeError</span><span>,</span> <span>ValueError</span><span>):</span>
</span><span>        <span>d</span><span>[</span><span>k</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>None</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>
</div>


<p>Here we go through dictionary and clean its values by coercing them to <code>int</code>. Or to <code>None</code> if that is impossible. Cleaning input and ignoring malformed data is quite frequent task and yet it takes so much effort. This is the way I want to write that:</p>

<div>
<figure><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span>
</pre></td><td><pre><code><span><span>walk_values</span><span>(</span><span>silent</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span>),</span> <span>request</span><span>)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>
</div>


<p>And it’s entirely possible with <a href="https://github.com/Suor/funcy">funcy</a>. But let’s move to the next one.</p>

<h3>Pairwise iteration</h3>

<p>This code checks if a sequence is ascending:</p>

<div>
<figure><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span>
<span>2</span>
<span>3</span>
<span>4</span>
<span>5</span>
<span>6</span>
<span>7</span>
<span>8</span>
</pre></td><td><pre><code><span><span>prev</span> <span>=</span> <span>None</span>
</span><span><span>for</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>seq</span><span>:</span>
</span><span>    <span>if</span> <span>prev</span> <span>is</span> <span>not</span> <span>None</span> <span>and</span> <span>x</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>prev</span><span>:</span>
</span><span>        <span>is_ascending</span> <span>=</span> <span>False</span>
</span><span>        <span>break</span>
</span><span>    <span>prev</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span>
</span><span><span>else</span><span>:</span>
</span><span>    <span>is_ascending</span> <span>=</span> <span>True</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>
</div>


<p>Ah, iterating over a sequence and keeping track of a previous element. How many times had you done that? There should be a function to abstract it:</p>

<div>
<figure><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span>
</pre></td><td><pre><code><span><span>is_ascending</span> <span>=</span> <span>all</span><span>(</span><span>l</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>r</span> <span>for</span> <span>l</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span> <span>in</span> <span>pairwise</span><span>(</span><span>seq</span><span>))</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>
</div>


<p>And <a href="http://funcy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/seqs.html#pairwise">pairwise</a> does exactly that. It enables us to iterate by sequence adjacent pairs. So we just need to check that all of them are ordered accordingly.</p>

<h3>…</h3>

<p>All these examples have one common property — red variants have more code. And more code:</p>

<ul>
<li>takes longer to write,</li>
<li>takes longer to read,</li>
<li>takes longer to debug,</li>
<li>contains more bugs.</li>
</ul>


<p>Obviously, underscore, funcy and friends help us write less code (at least in these three examples). But how do they do that?</p>

<h2>Extracting abstractions</h2>

<p>Let’s take another look at the first example. It does three things in a single blob of code:</p>

<figure><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span>
<span>2</span>
<span>3</span>
<span>4</span>
<span>5</span>
<span>6</span>
<span>7</span>
<span>8</span>
<span>9</span>
</pre></td><td><pre><code><span>images</span> <span>= []
</span><span>for url in</span> <span>urls</span><span>:
</span><span>    for attempt in range(DOWNLOAD_TRIES):
</span><span>        try:
</span><span>            images</span><span>.append(</span><span>download_image(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span><span>)
</span><span>            break
</span><span>        except HttpError:
</span><span>            if attempt + 1 == DOWNLOAD_TRIES:
</span><span>                <span>raise
</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>


<p>I highlighted every aspect of this code with separate color:</p>

<ul>
<li>image download (green),</li>
<li>retries on fails (red),</li>
<li>iteration through urls and result collection (blue).</li>
</ul>


<p>As you can see, three colors are interleaved here. This hints that corresponding aspects are entangled. And by “entangled” I mean they can not be reused separately. Say we need retries on fails in some other place, we will probably end up copying the whole block and updating it somewhat. Not exactly the best practice “code reuse”.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, we managed to separate reties then our code will look like:</p>

<figure><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span>
<span>2</span>
<span>3</span>
<span>4</span>
<span>5</span>
<span>6</span>
<span>7</span>
</pre></td><td><pre><code><span>def retry(...):
    ...

http_retry = retry(DOWNLOAD_TRIES, HttpError)
</span><span>images</span> <span>= []
</span><span>for url in</span> <span>urls</span><span>:
</span><span>    images</span><span>.append(</span><span>http_retry(</span><span>download_image</span><span>)</span><span>(url))
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>


<p>Now red code is nicely grouped at the top. Green and blue are still mixed, but now they represent a pattern so common that most modern languages have a builtin function to handle that:</p>

<figure><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span>
<span>2</span>
<span>3</span>
<span>4</span>
<span>5</span>
</pre></td><td><pre><code><span>def retry(...):
    ...

http_retry = retry(DOWNLOAD_TRIES, HttpError)
</span><span>images</span> <span>= map(<span>http_retry(</span><span>download_image</span><span>)</span><span>, <span>urls</span><span>)
</span></span></span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>


<p>This last variant has some lovely traits: each part of a task at hand (downloading images) appear only once, the whole iteration aspect is handled with a single <code>map()</code> call and retries are abstracted out into <a href="http://funcy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/flow.html#retry">the retry function</a>.</p>

<p>Extracting common behavior into a higher order functions is a first trick underscore and funcy use to make your life better.</p>

<h2>Hiding low level</h2>

<p>It’s time to go back to second example. I’ll throw away error handling to make snippets more even:</p>

<figure><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span>
<span>2</span>
<span>3</span>
<span>4</span>
<span>5</span>
</pre></td><td><pre><code><span><span># Using function</span>
</span><span><span>walk_values</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>request</span><span>)</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span># Using dict comprehension</span>
</span><span><span>{</span><span>k</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>k</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span> <span>in</span> <span>request</span><span>.</span><span>items</span><span>()}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>


<p>Now they are both one-liners, so how is first one better? Let’s identify every single distinct component of each code variant:</p>

<figure><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span>
<span>2</span>
<span>3</span>
<span>4</span>
<span>5</span>
</pre></td><td><pre><code><span><span># 3 components</span>
</span><span>walk_values(</span><span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>request</span><span>)
</span><span>
</span><span><span># 8 or so components</span>
</span><span><span>{</span><span>k</span><span>:</span> <span>int(</span><span>v</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>k</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span> <span>in</span> <span>request</span><span>.items()</span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>


<p>The second one looks like rainbow. But besides looking nice this means each time you write or read it you need to load all those components into your head, taking up all your cognitive resources. This is how first line is better.</p>

<p>That could be highlighted in even more obvious manner:</p>

<figure><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span>
<span>2</span>
<span>3</span>
<span>4</span>
</pre></td><td><pre><code><span>walk_values(int, request)
</span><span>
</span><span><span># red are low-level details</span>
</span><span><span>{</span><span>k</span><span>: int(</span><span>v</span><span>)</span> <span>for k, v in</span> <span>request</span><span>.items()</span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>


<p>This way we can see that about a half of the second line is low-level details. And low-level mean you don’t need to know all those details to understand what’s going on.</p>

<p>Hiding low-level details is the second way such libraries make your life better.</p>

<h2>Enriching our language</h2>

<p>I’ll translate the last example into natural language:</p>

<figure><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span>
<span>2</span>
<span>3</span>
<span>4</span>
<span>5</span>
<span>6</span>
<span>7</span>
<span>8</span>
<span>9</span>
<span>10</span>
<span>11</span>
<span>12</span>
<span>13</span>
<span>14</span>
<span>15</span>
<span>16</span>
</pre></td><td><pre><code><span><span>prev</span> <span>=</span> <span>None</span>
</span><span><span>for</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>seq</span><span>:</span>
</span><span>    <span>if</span> <span>prev</span> <span>is</span> <span>not</span> <span>None</span> <span>and</span> <span>x</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>prev</span><span>:</span>
</span><span>        <span>is_ascending</span> <span>=</span> <span>False</span>
</span><span>        <span>break</span>
</span><span>    <span>prev</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span>
</span><span><span>else</span><span>:</span>
</span><span>    <span>is_ascending</span> <span>=</span> <span>True</span>
</span><span><span># Starting with empty prev, iterate over seq, bookkeeping prev actuality,</span>
</span><span><span># on each cycle if prev is present and current element is less or equal than it</span>
</span><span><span># then set is_ascending to False and break.</span>
</span><span><span># If loop wasn't broken set is_ascending to True</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>is_ascending</span> <span>=</span> <span>all</span><span>(</span><span>l</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>r</span> <span>for</span> <span>l</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span> <span>in</span> <span>pairwise</span><span>(</span><span>seq</span><span>))</span>
</span><span><span># set is_ascending to all left elements being smaller than right</span>
</span><span><span># in adjacent pairs of seq</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>


<p>Obviously, more code emits more text. Higher level code generates an explanation utilizing higher level abstractions. This way we can use bigger building blocks not only in coding, but in problem solving.</p>

<p>And this is the third way _ makes your life better.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>All the things we came through are completely language independent. So there gotta be underscore for every language? Not quite, and more importantly a straight-forward port is not always a great idea: common behaviors to abstract vary per language and especially per application. The right approach would be to follow core ideas. Or look around if someone have already done that.</p>

		<p>First, at Repl.it we're not motivated by competition. What we care about the most is making programming and computing more accessible. That means anyone who wants to code and build things should be able to do so without any hurdles.</p>
<p>Recently, Glitch, one of our competitors focusing on JavaScript, has blocked pinging services from reaching user apps. Among other things it means they broke the Discord bot experience for their users. We don't have any insight on why they did that but it seems part of a larger change they're going through which also resulted in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21268007/glitch-layoffs-substantial-number-coding-platform-union">layoffs</a>. </p>
<p>That resulted in a user influx to Repl.it so I wanted to write this to welcome you to Repl.it and tell you a little about us.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/glitch.png" alt="users posting on glitch forum about repl.it"></p>
<p>Repl.it has existed since 2011 and we've been growing the service in a sustainable way that doesn't result in disruptive changes. Building a service like ours is hard, especially for a small team like ours, and we're constantly improving and making things better. But our absolute top priority is being a place coders can depend on -- we will try our absolute best to never let you down.</p>
<p>Because many people are asking us, as co-founders &amp; CEO I want to make a promise to you that we will never block pinging services or make any abrupt changes that will break your apps. We built our infrastructure in a way that doesn't make it super expensive on us to ping your repl to keep it up. </p>
<p>We have a new feature coming out for Hacker plan subscribers that will make repls even more reliable that they wouldn't need pinging in the first place. But we will never ban pinging to force people to upgrade by taking away features.</p>

I recently came across a YouTube video about an exciting new development. Researchers at NVIDIA enabled an AI to essentially recreate PAC-MAN after watching some 50,000 episodes of the game being played. The <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/22/gamegan-research-pacman-anniversary/" target="_blank">blog post</a> makes for fascinating reading and it made me think more about the potential machine learning could have for mobile game development. <br> Machine learning is a fast growing industry that was worth $6.9bn globally in 2018 alone, according to <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/machine-learning-market" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Grand View Research</a>. Furthermore, recent research by <a href="https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/machine-learning-market-2494" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Market Research Future</a> indicates it is expected to grow by around "42.08% CAGR during the forecast period 2018–2024". A lot of reporting done by media outlets such as <i>Forbes</i> have highlighted <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2020/01/19/roundup-of-machine-learning-forecasts-and-market-estimates-2020/#7e93fbb85c02" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">potential growth</a> in areas such as driver safety, internet security, applications in the financial market et al.&nbsp; <br> What about mobile gaming, though? Machine learning is already being used by companies in this space to improve <a href="https://addepto.com/monetize-mobile-gaming-machine-learning/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">monetisation</a>&nbsp;(helping to create personalised in-game offers, for exam…

As I wrote <a href="https://staticcatgames.blogspot.com/2020/07/do-mobile-game-revenue-models-need-a-rethink.html" target="_blank">recently</a>, Apple is altering contracts for some of its Apple Arcade developers as it focuses more and more on the need for engagement instead of throwing large numbers of games at subscribers and hoping something will stick. Apple execs have come to the conclusion that throwing money at games and building a large library of games just won't cut it. Bankrolling games for little to no return isn't a viable business model in the long term. <i>MacRumors </i>gives an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/30/apple-arcade-game-strategy-shift/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">example of the costs</a>, saying: "Apple has funded work on many games that have been created for ‌Apple Arcade‌, spending between $1 million and $5 million on several titles so far." <br> What they need are players to carry on, well, <i>playing </i>these games day in, day out.&nbsp; <br> The major problem Apple is facing is that none of the games in the Apple Arcade portfolio are major hits. It needs to rectify this and fast. Competition for the subscription service comes from its own app store, which offers a vast number of games (…

  <p><span>opensource</span></p><p>21 Jul 2020</p>


<p>3 minute read</p>

<p>Open Source Software and especially large projects have a few defined standards that are used to promote welcoming new contributors and ensure a healthy collaborative environment like for example <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code>, <code>CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</code>, and <a href="https://github.blog/2016-02-17-issue-and-pull-request-templates/">issue/pull request templates</a>.</p>

<p>Despite this, even in popular projects, there is a disconcerting lack of guidance on the actual structure of the software and its inner workings.</p>

<p>For example, as a part of the <a href="https://codein.withgoogle.com/archive/">open source Google Code-in event</a>, last winter I started contributing and still contribute to <a href="https://github.com/publiclab/">Public Lab</a>, an environmental community that develops environmental software.</p>

<p>This forum’s code base is relatively large, especially for an open source beginner. It has about ~25 controllers, ~30 models and a very complete testing suite with functional, unit and system testing all automated with Travis.</p>

<p>But I took some time and read through the code to understand how the different bits and pieces of the app interacted, and grew to a confident level with some parts and at least an abstraction of understanding with the others. I luckily also had the help of my mentors who answered my questions during this process.</p>

<p>Obviously, this mentorship is often unavailable and new contributors have to scrutinize the code base on their own, and try to come up with a vague understanding of the components that will prevent them from creating a breaking change in another part of the app.</p>

<p>For example, in other industries, usually physical blueprints serve as this stepping stone to provide an overview of how the product works as a whole and yet it’s often missing in software engineering.</p>

<p>Let’s take an example. I’ve been getting into the <a href="https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/">Crystal</a> programming language as a faster, type-checked alternative to Ruby. I really enjoyed the language and wanted to contribute and understand the code. I checked out their <a href="https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md"><code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code></a> and it provided me with mostly a social / collaborative overview of where I can discuss issues or ideas, where I can ask questions, etc… What it did <strong>not</strong> provide was a <strong>technical</strong> overview of how the code is structured, the way it all comes together and its tech stack.</p>

<p>Putting this information would be helpful to not put off curious contributors that want to learn and develop a higher-level understanding of how the project works.</p>

<p>These frustrations are pushing me to propose a new “standard” for welcoming open source contribution, an <code>ARCHITECTURE.md</code> file, that would work on top of <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> to inform on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The tech stack, the backend / frontend / db / middleware technologies used</li>
  <li>The structure of the code and its logical links (diagrams :)), for example, crystal’s code is organised with <code>/src/modulename/submodule.cr</code> structure (for example <a href="https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/blob/master/src/csv/parser.cr"><code>/src/csv/parser.cr</code></a>), i.e. how does it all come together and what is the flow of the software. The <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/C4-architecture-model/">C4 model for software architecture</a> provide an instruction set for how engineers can use diagrams to easily explain their architecture.</li>
  <li>Specifications for testing and general guidelines on testing constraints for said project paired with details on the CI process.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s easy for the creators of a project to represent in their minds the way all the pieces of the project come together, but transcribing these pieces together into a document would be extremely beneficial, not only to teach others but also to clarify and renew one’s own understanding of their own code base.</p>

<p>If you have any other ideas for additional information it could contain, please comment! I think this could be incredibly useful in general to make access to open source projects easier and lower the learning curve.</p>

<meta content="    Artificial intelligence could revolutionize computer graphics like the first 3D accelerators. With the PC game â€œDeath Strandingâ€�, Nvidia..." name="twitter:description">
<div id="adsense-target"><p><img data-original-height="600" data-original-width="1000" height="384" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VMjKfEZDs6s/Xxnxhck8k_I/AAAAAAAAAd8/uhxyRLXACPwXOzowEczo02l6vcLUV2tegCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/death_stranding_pc_dlss.jpg" width="640"></p>

<p><span>Artificial intelligence could revolutionize computer graphics like the first 3D accelerators. With the PC game “Death Stranding”, Nvidia proves that the technology is suitable for everyday use and brings massive advantages.<p>With Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) , Nvidia trains an artificial neural network with high-resolution ideal recordings of a video game. With DLSS 2.0, Nvidia uses an AI network that is generally trained for game upscaling, which only needs to be fine-tuned for the respective game and integrated into the rendering process. With DLSS 1.0, every game needed its own AI training.</p><p>Compared to the first DLSS experiment, Nvidia improved another crucial point in the training process with DLSS 2.0: The neural network is now taught with images in 16K resolution (15,360 × 8,640) instead of the previous 4K resolution. As a comparison, Nvidia provides low-resolution images during training. The training itself takes place on a supercomputer.</p><p>Through training, the AI ​​learns the difference between low and high resolution as well as the details of 16K resolution. When scaling up, it can supplement these details and requires significantly less power than the native display in high resolution.</p><p><b>DLSS 2.0 in Death Stranding: Better than native 4K resolution</b><br>According to the international PC trade press, this AI upscaling works so well in the new Death Stranding that the image quality of the image scaled up by the AI ​​even beats the native 4K display.</p><p>Digital Foundry, for example, writes: "If you don't use DLSS, you won't see the game in its most beautiful form." Intuitively, this does not initially appear logical. However, if you keep in mind that the AI ​​supplements the image with details of a 16K resolution, it makes sense.</p><p>The testers at <a href="https://www.dsogaming.com/screenshot-news/death-stranding-native-4k-vs-fidelityfx-upscaling-vs-dlss-2-0/">DSOGaming</a> or <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/death-stranding-pc-dlss-performance-preview">Toms Hardware</a> also praise the high image quality. “In many cases the visual impression with AI upsampling is as good as with the native resolution and often slightly better. In addition, there were no graphic errors with DLSS during gaming, ”writes Computerbase .</p></span></p><p><span>The following video shows the DLSS image compared to native 4K (from 15:40).<p>https://youtu.be/ggnvhFSrPGE</p><p>Even more important than the somewhat better image quality is the massive performance gain that Digital Foundry measures: DLSS 4K runs around 38 percent faster than native 4K rendering in the nicer quality mode. AI upscaling is 70 percent faster in performance mode.</p><p><b>AI upscaling: The graphics world will change</b><br>This increase in speed results in significantly higher refresh rates: the AI ​​modes scale up a native resolution that is between 50 and 67 percent of the displayed resolution. The graphics card is relieved of a massive load - and there is a realistic chance that the efficiency of the AI ​​rendering is still at the beginning.</p><p>Microsoft's Playfab team, for example, is experimenting internally with AI upscaling, which is supposed to work like a “magic compression technology”.</p><p>"You can't tell the difference between a hand-made high-resolution texture and the machine-enlarged texture based on a low-resolution texture, so you can start with a low-resolution texture and then let the machine do the rest," Microsoft team leader James said Gwertzman.</p></span><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7Ia-npz_bZ8/Xxnw4xFPQbI/AAAAAAAAAd0/BVSh9A2VHww7wmMbmD7WDyKRs7sqE-qNACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/morrorwind_KI_skalierung_textur.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="498" data-original-width="1000" height="316" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7Ia-npz_bZ8/Xxnw4xFPQbI/AAAAAAAAAd0/BVSh9A2VHww7wmMbmD7WDyKRs7sqE-qNACLcBGAsYHQ/s640/morrorwind_KI_skalierung_textur.jpg" width="640"></a><span><p>The comparison shows a texture rendered using AI. It can be clearly seen that the AI ​​does not simply inflate the image with neighboring pixels of similar color, but supplements new details.</p><p>Game designers may have to design only a small part of their assets in all details in the future - as soon as there are enough image examples for the AI ​​training, the AI ​​could learn the style and render the remaining, low-resolution textures to the same quality level. This would save a lot of time and money in the development process.</p><p><b>Training with videos instead of screenshots: Oculus is up to AI upscaling for VR</b><br>AI upscaling is made for VR and AR : Here the render load is particularly high due to the 3D and 360-degree display with high refresh rates. A combination of eye tracking and AI upscaling could ensure photo-realistic graphics quality that still does not require a high-end PC.</p><p>Oculus researchers recently presented a paper on AI upscaling specifically for VR apps . The AI ​​was trained with high-resolution videos instead of images and should deliver better results than DLSS. In addition, the technology runs on any hardware instead of only with selected Nvidia graphics cards.</p><p>It would also be conceivable that only very low-resolution graphics are streamed via the cloud, which are then reproduced locally by an AI in high image quality. The vision of everywhere XR streaming would come a good deal closer.</p></span></p>

<p>This is about a reaction I noticed with myself in response to membership programs, patreons and individual sponsorship as I've run into significantly more of these following Corona. The advertising-supported model has confirmed many of the concerns about its sustainability and creators are looking for more reliable options. I think this feeling I have might be something other people experience and something for creators to be prepared for.</p>
<p>Creating anything in a sustainable fashion is hard work. You are fighting uphill against a cultural expectation for things to be free on the web. Often a simple solution is a good solution. The simplest way is asking ones extremely enthusiastic fans to chip in, often with some incentive, such as bonus content. It is a solution with strongly aligned incentives, those who pay get more of the thing they like and they are already invested in sustaining the creation. The creator gets paid without needing to tailor their format or subject matter to the whims of sponsors or advertisers and can focus on making what the fans already want. Well-aligned incentives.</p>
<p>I think this model is great when it works, I think CGP Grey <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aN44ETT6mUY">made his case very well</a>. He generally makes tightly produced videos with long times between releases. YouTube advertising monetization is not optimized for his content though I'm sure it does pretty well. Beyond that the pandemic means companies cut down on advertising and this pushes more creators to try this model as rates go down and opportunities dwindle.</p>
<p>I've noticed something about my reaction to an increasing number of memberships. They frustrate me. Especially when they come in groups or too closely. This is a feeling, my robotic logic, I'm mostly human. I feel a bit of an "ugh" even before I consider whether the offer makes sense for me or not.</p>
<p>Part of it can be FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). I absolutely dislike not having access to all of the content or behind-the-scenes for something I follow enthusiastically. Part of it can be the normal reaction to a kind of paywall. But generally the podcasts, newsletters and stuff that I follow aren't actually removing anything. They are just adding some premium stuff. I still feel that twitch, that small frustration.</p>
<p>So what do I think it is? A kind of fatigue, as the title indicates. I want to support, I want to engage. But I also want to be mindful in how I spend my money. And $5/month adds up pretty quickly. There is a lot of consideration in committing that recurring payment for .. indefinite duration. And I think I'm getting sick of deciding. I always feel an element of shame if I don't support a creator I like. I think a key term here is support. Positive thing right? You are supposed to support good things. So why aren't you being supportive? This is of course a bit irrational and you shouldn't feel bad. As often is the case with feelings, we don't get to decide them.</p>
<p>Let's call this the <strong>Five Dollar Fatigue</strong>, sounds catchy. If the trend continues I can be a thought-leader and I'm sure that's good for something. So yeah, the feeling of growing frustration connected to things you like or love continuously asking you for money.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how to lower the internal conflict when this kind of arrangement is brought up.</p>
<p>For me, personally. I think I might need to figure out what my actual budget is for supporting independent creators on a monthly basis. Then I don't have to re-evaluate it each time something I like wants my financial support.</p>
<p>For creators. I think most are thoughtful and graceful when they ask for the money and I think it would be worse if they were as heavy-handed as Wikipedia for example (lots of pressure and guilt in all communication, I've complained to them repeatedly). I think creators just need to be ready for the possibility that some fans will still react poorly, or more grudgingly accepting than enthusiastic not because of that particular arrangement but because of all the ones considered before it.</p>
<p>If you have thoughts on this piece of writing do let me know at <a href="mailto:lars@underjord.io">lars@underjord.io</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/lawik">@lawik</a> on Twitter. If you want more of my writing I have
    a non-tracking newsletter which usually comes with
    podcast recommendations and more in-depth thinking. Often about sustainability in software.</p>

<p>Bad decision-makers who make quick decisions get themselves in a lot of trouble. They need to slow down and be more thoughtful.</p>



<p>Bad decision-makers who make slow and thoughtful decisions are still bad decision-makers. They need to make better decisions.</p>



<p>Good decision-makers who makes slow and thoughtful decisions do well for themselves but they waste time and endure unnecessary stress due to indecision. They need to be more decisive.</p>



<p>Good decision-makers who make quick decisions are great decision-makers. They trust their good judgement and make the most good decisions.</p>

            <p>
    Scott Adams, the creator of the famous comic strip <a href="https://dilbert.com/">Dilbert</a>, states that there’s two main ways to become wealthy:
    </p>
    <ol>
    
    <li>Be the best in the world at one skill.
    
    </li><li>Be in the top 10% for a range of skills.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    The first set includes people like Michael Phelps and Bill Gates. I’m going to make the likely assumption that you’re not part of that group. 
    </p>
    <p>
    The second set of people is much bigger. Scott Adams himself is part of that group. 
    </p>
    <p>
    He’s not the best illustrator in the world, but he’s better than most. 
    </p>
    <p>
    He’s not the best writer in the world, but he’s better than most.
    </p>
    <p>
    He’s not the funniest person in the world, but he’s funnier than most.
    </p>
    <p>
    The magic happens when you combine those skills of his:

    </center>

    <p>
    Everyone has their own unique combination of skills. Scott Adams’ skill stack is going to be different than yours. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Being able to understand your own skill stack and be proactive about adding elements to it will help you make clear decisions on what opportunities to pursue. 
    </p>
    <h2>Learning to code</h2>
    
    
    <p>
    About 14 months ago, I graduated with a philosophy degree. I had pretty good writing skills and knew a bit about content marketing because of some side projects.
    </p>
    <p>
    But what I really wanted to do was build things. I knew that if I could learn to code, I’d be able to leverage my other skills and pursue projects that unlocked new opportunities. For instance, at work, I’d be able to complete tasks that I couldn’t before. 
    </p>
    <p>
    So that’s what I set out to do. I enrolled in an online coding school and chopped away every single day:
    </p>
    <center>
        <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_skillstack/github_commits.png" width="614" height="121" alt="">
    </center>
    <p>
    I learned data analysis skills like SQL and picked up web development. At work, now, I can be much more productive and rather than relying on other people whenever I need to query something, I can do so myself. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Outside of work, I can also hack on side projects that I didn’t have the ability to do before. This site is one of them (here’s another more <a href="https://www.ratemyroommate.io/">comical example</a>). 
    </p>
    <p>
    My technical skills, to be frank, are average. But when you combine them with my other skills like writing and marketing, I can pursue opportunities that I have a competitive advantage in. 
    </p>
    <h2>How To Choose Your Skills</h2>
    
    
    <p>
    Nat Eliason has a <a href="https://www.nateliason.com/blog/what-you-should-learn">great article</a> on this. Roughly speaking, you should identify what type of outcome you want and then work backwards to identify what skills you might need to get there. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Let’s do this exercise for a couple of fields:
    </p>
    <h3>Example #1: Product Marketer to Product Manager</h3>
    
    
    <p>
    Whilst there’s definitely roles out there for non-technical PMs, your number one priority ought to be to level up on the technical side of things. 
    </p>
    <p>
    As a product manager, you’re likely going to be collaborating with engineers on a daily basis, so learning the fundamentals of programming will help you have more credibility when you speak with technical folks. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Another thing to mention here might be that as a product marketer, you’re used to coming into play <em>after</em> the product already exists. You’re creating content around its features and its use cases. As a PM, you’re in charge of building it from the ground up. <a href="https://hackernoon.com/from-marketing-to-product-management-3de21282c7ce">This article</a> has great recommendations on what type of skills you might need to learn.  
    </p>
    <p>
    Your skill stack in this scenario might end up looking like this:
    </p>
    <center>
        <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_skillstack/product_marketer_v2.png" width="658" height="370" alt="">
    </center>
    <h3>Example #2: Account Manager to Head of Account Management</h3>
    
    
    <p>
    Whilst the above was an example of a lateral career change, this is moreso to do with promotion. 
    </p>
    <p>
    As an Account Manager, you’re focusing on the day to day tasks of growing your accounts and keeping your clients happy. 
    </p>
    <p>
    From what I’ve observed, the Head of Account Management is going to have to play the role of quarterback. This requires the ability to vouch for the AMs who are reporting to you (along with knowing what motivates them), collaborating smartly with other departments, and being able to stay organized whilst your number of responsibilities steadily increase. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Rather than learning technical skills, such a change might require consuming books on leadership and taking courses on effective prioritization of tasks. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Your skill stack in this scenario might end up looking like this:
    </p>
    <center>
        <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_skillstack/account_manager_v2.png" width="658" height="370" alt="">
    </center>
    <h3>Example #3: UX Designer to Freelancer</h3>
    
    
    <p>
    Say you’ve worked for an agency as a UX Designer but now you’re ready to go out on your own. You have the chops needed to design beautiful experiences but now that you’re on your own, you need a way to find clients. 
    </p>
    <p>
    In this case, you’re going to need to focus on building a brand, doing effective outreach, and learning techniques like upselling. <a href="https://twitter.com/jackbutcher?lang=en">Jack Butcher</a> is a perfect example of this - he spent a decade honing his craft and then started his company Visualize Value. Now he makes $100k / month. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Your skill stack in this scenario might end up looking like this:
    </p>
    <center>
        <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_skillstack/ux_designer_v2.png" width="658" height="370" alt="">
    </center>
    <h2>Carving out time</h2>
    
    
    <p>
    Once you’ve identified what skills you want to learn, you need to be aggressive about finding the time to learn them. 
    </p>
    <p>
    If you work a full time job, this can be hard to do. I’ve had success with waking up a couple of hours before work and putting in some <a href="https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/avoidcalendarcreep">deep work</a>. Alternatively, once you finish your work day, you can go exercise and then put in hours in the evening. I’ve found exercise to act as a great way to reset. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Another thing you could do is talk directly with your employer and ask them to subsidize any courses you want to take. The key here would be to present a clear argument on why the course would help you at your job.
    </p>
    <p>
    Finally, one thing I’d stress is that even though the claim in this article is that you don’t need to be the best at a skill to reap its rewards, this doesn’t mean that this is some kind of magic pill to accelerate your career.
    </p>
    <p>
    Even getting moderately good at something takes time. Over the last year I’ve spent around 1000 hours learning to code, but I’ve just scratched the surface in terms of the level I want to be at. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Whenever I feel discouraged, I’m reminded of this video featuring computer science professor Randy Pausch:
    </p>

<![CDATA[Using Turbolinks with the SAFE web stack]]>
            </title>

July 23, 2020 | https://viktorvan.github.io/fsharp/safe-stack-turbolinks/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://viktorvan.github.io/fsharp/safe-stack-turbolinks/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
        
          
        
        <p>“Do you really need a single-page application for that?”</p>

<h3 id="background---what-is-turbolinks">Background - What is Turbolinks?</h3>

<p>Turbolinks is a javascript library that gives your web application the look and feel of a single-page application, without really being one. The idea is that it intercepts any navigation and instead of reloading the page at that point, it fetches the page in the background and just switches the whole html &lt;body&gt; from response with the current body. A little simplified of course.</p>

<p>From the Turbolinks documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Turbolinks® makes navigating your web application faster. Get the performance benefits of a single-page application without the added complexity of a client-side JavaScript framework. Use HTML to render your views on the server side and link to pages as usual. When you follow a link, Turbolinks automatically fetches the page, swaps in its &lt;body&gt;, and merges its &lt;head&gt;, all without incurring the cost of a full page load.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Turbolinks can be a good compromise when only a little interactivity is needed on the frontend, and you don’t want to setup a full single page application. It gives the user the feel a single-page application, but most of the business logic can be kept server-side.</p>

<p>I was previously using Elmish for this application, and so far I prefer this “simpler” solution I ended up with when using Turbolinks. But I should say that this is a quite simple application. If there is a lot of stuff going on the client-side I wouldn’t hesitate to use Elmish. Or maybe a hybrid approach with Turbolinks for most of the application and the <a href="https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/Feliz/#/Hooks/UseElmish">Feliz.UseElmish</a> React hook for any complicated components.</p>

<p>Turbolinks is originally a Ruby on Rails feature, but it really is just a javascript library that you load on your client, so you can use it with any webstack that uses javascript on the frontend<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. In this example I am using the F# <a href="https://safe-stack.github.io/">SAFE webstack</a> with <a href="https://saturnframework.org/">Saturn</a>/<a href="https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe">Giraffe</a>, if you for some reason prefer to work with something else, maybe C# and ASP.NET Core MVC it is still possible to benefit from using Turbolinks, of course.</p>

<h3 id="the-demo-application">The demo application</h3>

<p>The demo application is a simplified version of an application I am using to keep track of how many eggs my chickens are laying. It is a very simple application where you can select a date and see what chickens that have laid an egg that day. You can also add/remove eggs; click on a chicken to add an egg, click on an egg to remove it. At the bottom we display some totals. Simple as that.</p>

<p><img src="https://viktorvan.github.io/assets/images/safe-turbolinks-demo-application.gif" alt="demo application"></p>

<p>The complete demo application is available on <a href="https://github.com/viktorvan/safe-stack-turbolinks-demo">github</a>.</p>

<h3 id="our-goals">Our goals</h3>

<p>So the goals we are reaching for with our Turbolinks enabled application is to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Render all html on the server.</li>
  <li>Navigate different dates: use Turbolinks to out-of-the-box handle page navigation.</li>
  <li>Edit data (add/remove eggs): use add some client side interactivity with javascript (or fable, rather).</li>
  <li>Deal with redirects</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="step-1-render-all-html-on-the-server">Step 1. Render all html on the server</h3>

<p>I started out with an existing elmish application, so I was previously rendering the views with Fable, using <a href="https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/Feliz/">Feliz</a> and <a href="https://dzoukr.github.io/Feliz.Bulma/">Feliz.Bulma</a>. The client was then using <a href="https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/Fable.Remoting/">Fable.Remoting</a> to load and save data from the backend. 
The interface for the Fable.Remoting api was initially:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>IChickenApi</span> <span>=</span>
        <span>{</span> <span>GetAllChickens</span><span>:</span> <span>NotFutureDate</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Async</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Chicken</span> <span>list</span><span>&gt;</span>
          <span>GetEggCount</span><span>:</span> <span>NotFutureDate</span> <span>*</span> <span>ChickenId</span> <span>list</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Async</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ChickenId</span><span>,</span> <span>EggCount</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span> 
          <span>AddEgg</span><span>:</span> <span>ChickenId</span> <span>*</span> <span>NotFutureDate</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Async</span><span>&lt;</span><span>unit</span><span>&gt;</span>
          <span>RemoveEgg</span><span>:</span> <span>ChickenId</span> <span>*</span> <span>NotFutureDate</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Async</span><span>&lt;</span><span>unit</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For completeness, here are the types it’s using</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>ChickenId</span> <span>=</span> <span>ChickenId</span> <span>of</span> <span>Guid</span>
<span>type</span> <span>EggCount</span> <span>=</span> <span>EggCount</span> <span>of</span> <span>int</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In our Turbolinks application the html will be rendered on the server instead, so i need to move my views to the backend. The backend I am using (Saturn/Giraffe) has a view engine that i could use, but there is even a view engine available for <a href="https://github.com/dbrattli/feliz.viewengine">Feliz and Feliz.Bulma</a>. So that made my work really easy, I could just copy my views from the client to the server, and remove anything related to event listeners, <code>onchange</code>, <code>onselect</code>, etc.</p>

<p>This means I will no longer be needing the <code>Get...</code> functions in the <code>IChickenApi</code>. That data will now be returned as a single html view from the backend. The browser client no longer needs to be dealing with updating react views with the chicken and eggcount data returned from the api. It just needs to display the html. Simple. We are left with some edit functions that we will be using in a later step:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>IChickenApi</span> <span>=</span>
        <span>{</span> <span>AddEgg</span><span>:</span> <span>ChickenId</span> <span>*</span> <span>NotFutureDate</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Async</span><span>&lt;</span><span>unit</span><span>&gt;</span>
          <span>RemoveEgg</span><span>:</span> <span>ChickenId</span> <span>*</span> <span>NotFutureDate</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Async</span><span>&lt;</span><span>unit</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And I have made the following addition in my <a href="https://github.com/viktorvan/safe-stack-turbolinks-demo/-blob/master/src/Server/Server.fs">server setup</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Server.fs</span>

<span>let</span> <span>defaultRoute</span><span>()</span> <span>=</span> <span>sprintf</span> <span>"/chickens?date=%s"</span> <span>(</span><span>NotFutureDate</span><span>.</span><span>today</span><span>()</span><span>.</span><span>ToString</span><span>()</span><span>)</span>
<span>let</span> <span>browser</span> <span>=</span> <span>router</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>get</span> <span>"/"</span> <span>(</span><span>redirectTo</span> <span>false</span> <span>(</span><span>defaultRoute</span><span>()</span><span>))</span>
    <span>get</span> <span>"/chickens"</span> <span>chickensView</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>where <a href="https://github.com/viktorvan/safe-stack-turbolinks-demo/blob/master/src/Server/Views/Chickens.fs">chickensView</a> renders the html.</p>

<p>We can now navigate the application as a normal server application and use the arrow buttons to change date. We cannot use the datepicker yet though, or add/remove eggs, since that requires some javascript on the client side. We will fix that in later steps.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-navigate-dates-using-turbolinks">Step 2. Navigate dates using Turbolinks</h3>

<p>To enable Turbolinks you could just add it in a script tag in your html head:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;script </span><span>src=</span><span>"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/turbolinks/5.1.1/turbolinks.js"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>but since I will be adding some javascript of my own and will be creating my own javascript bundle, I will <a href="https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks#installation-using-npm">install Turbolinks with npm</a> and require it instead:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>npm</span> <span>install</span> <span>--save</span> <span>turbolinks</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Turbolinks.fs</span>
<span>module</span> <span>Client</span><span>.</span><span>Turbolinks</span>

<span>open</span> <span>Fable</span><span>.</span><span>Core</span><span>.</span><span>JsInterop</span>

<span>type</span> <span>private</span> <span>ITurbolinksLib</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>abstract</span> <span>start</span> <span>:</span> <span>unit</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>unit</span>
    <span>abstract</span> <span>clearCache</span> <span>:</span> <span>unit</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>unit</span>
    <span>abstract</span> <span>visit</span> <span>:</span> <span>string</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>unit</span>

<span>let</span> <span>private</span> <span>turbolinks</span> <span>:</span> <span>ITurbolinksLib</span> <span>=</span> <span>importDefault</span> <span>"turbolinks"</span>

<span>let</span> <span>start</span><span>()</span> <span>=</span> <span>turbolinks</span><span>.</span><span>start</span><span>()</span>
<span>let</span> <span>visit</span> <span>url</span> <span>=</span> <span>turbolinks</span><span>.</span><span>visit</span> <span>url</span>
<span>let</span> <span>reset</span><span>()</span> <span>=</span>

    <span>turbolinks</span><span>.</span><span>visit</span> <span>""</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>then, in my client <a href="https://github.com/viktorvan/safe-stack-turbolinks-demo/blob/master/src/Client/App.fs">entry-point</a> I add</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>// App.fs</span>
<span>Turbolinks</span><span>.</span><span>start</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If I run the app now, and try to navigate using the navigation arrows, there are no longer any page reloads in the browser. Scripts and css are only loaded on the first page load. Turbolinks is doing it’s magic and intercepting navigation events and loading the data in the background. It also caches any visited pages, and will display the cached version while loading new data from the server.</p>

<h4 id="step-2b-dealing-with-permanent-elements">Step 2b. Dealing with “permanent” elements</h4>

<p>For this example i have added a navbar to the application, it displays the version of the application. On a narrow screen the link will be replaced with a burger menu button which the user can choose to expand. Except, there is no longer any javascript that expands that menu since I removed everything from the Elmish application. Let’s add that functionality back again<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>:</p>

<p>First we need to setup webpack to bundle our client scripts. I am using the webpack.config.js generated by the <a href="https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/template-overview/">safe-template</a> as starting point. Since we no longer will be running the client as a single page application I remove all the sections related to the webpack-dev-server. Also, we won’t be serving an index.html directly, that is going to be rendered by our server, so I remove the index.html file and the HtmlWebpackPlugin. This is my resulting <a href="https://github.com/viktorvan/safe-stack-turbolinks-demo/blob/master/webpack.config.js">webpack.config.js</a><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>We need to add an event listener for the navbar burger button that toggles <code>is-active</code> class on the corresponding navbar elements.</p>

<p>First some functions to toggle the classes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>open</span> <span>Browser</span>

<span>let</span> <span>toggleClass</span> <span>className</span> <span>(</span><span>e</span><span>:</span> <span>Element</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>newClasses</span> <span>=</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>e</span><span>.</span><span>className</span><span>.</span><span>Contains</span><span>(</span><span>className</span><span>)</span> <span>then</span>
            <span>e</span><span>.</span><span>className</span><span>.</span><span>Replace</span><span>(</span><span>className</span><span>,</span> <span>""</span><span>)</span>
        <span>else</span>
            <span>e</span><span>.</span><span>className</span> <span>+</span> <span>" "</span> <span>+</span> <span>className</span>
    <span>e</span><span>.</span><span>className</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>newClasses</span>

<span>let</span> <span>toggleNavbarMenu</span> <span>()</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>"chickencheck-navbar-burger"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>.</span><span>ofObj</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>.</span><span>iter</span> <span>(</span><span>toggleClass</span> <span>"is-active"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>"chickencheck-navbar-menu"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>.</span><span>ofObj</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>.</span><span>iter</span> <span>(</span><span>toggleClass</span> <span>"is-active"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>then, using event delegation we add the following event listener:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// App.fs</span>

<span>document</span><span>.</span><span>onclick</span> <span>&lt;-</span>
    <span>fun</span> <span>ev</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>target</span> <span>=</span> <span>ev</span><span>.</span><span>target</span> <span>:?&gt;</span> <span>Element</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>target</span><span>.</span><span>closest</span><span>(</span><span>".navbar-burger"</span><span>).</span><span>IsSome</span> <span>then</span>
            <span>Navbar</span><span>.</span><span>toggleNavbarMenu</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But we will be adding some more onclick events later on, let’s refactor this a bit. The <a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/convenience-active-patterns/">Active Pattern</a> feature of F# will come in handy here, let’s define a pattern for our navbar button target:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>let</span> <span>(|</span><span>NavbarBurger</span><span>|_|)</span> <span>(</span><span>target</span><span>:</span> <span>Element</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>target</span><span>.</span><span>closest</span><span>(</span><span>".navbar-burger"</span><span>).</span><span>IsSome</span> <span>then</span> 
            <span>Some</span> <span>NavbarBurger</span> 
        <span>else</span> 
            <span>None</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and then use it when we add the event listener:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// App.fs</span>
<span>document</span><span>.</span><span>onclick</span> <span>&lt;-</span>
    <span>fun</span> <span>ev</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
        <span>match</span> <span>ev</span><span>.</span><span>target</span> <span>:?&gt;</span> <span>Element</span> <span>with</span>
        <span>|</span> <span>NavbarBurger</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Navbar</span><span>.</span><span>toggleNavbarMenu</span><span>()</span>
        <span>|</span> <span>_</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>if we try it out now, it <em>almost</em> works as expected:</p>

<p><img src="https://viktorvan.github.io/assets/images/safe-turbolinks-toggle-navbar-menu1.gif" alt="toggling navbar menu"></p>

<p>When navigating to another date, we expect that menu stays expanded, but it’s doesn’t. When Turbolinks replaces the html body with the new one it fetched from the server it will overwrite any changes we have done with javascript. But there is a solution for this, we need to mark our navbar with the <a href="https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks#persisting-elements-across-page-loads"><code>data-turbolinks-permanent</code></a> attribute<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>Bulma</span><span>.</span><span>navbar</span> <span>[</span>
        <span>prop</span><span>.</span><span>id</span> <span>"chickencheck-navbar"</span>
        <span>prop</span><span>.</span><span>custom</span> <span>(</span><span>"data-turbolinks-permanent"</span><span>,</span> <span>""</span><span>)</span>
        <span>// ...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With this attribute in place Turbolinks will save that element and transfer it to the new page, preserving the data and event listeners. Now the navbar menu will stay expanded even when navigating:</p>

<p><img src="https://viktorvan.github.io/assets/images/safe-turbolinks-toggle-navbar-menu2.gif" alt="toggling navbar menu"></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>In a team I sat next to, a junior developer asked a senior to conduct code review for a newly completed feature. According to the process, that Senior had to approve all changes going to production. Here is how it went:</p>

<p>Junior: “Could you please take a look at my code?”</p>

<p>Senior: “No, I am busy. Send me a PR; I’ll take a look when I have more time.” (never)</p>

<p>Junior: “This is urgent; our key customer needs this fix. Can you take a look now?”</p>

<p>Senior (eyes rolling): “O.K.”</p>

<p>For the next ten minutes, the senior was scrolling the code back and forth, revealing no emotions in dead silence; he looked very unhappy. Because the silence was unbearable and senior showed almost no signs of life, the curious Junior interrupted the busy reviewer by sending an ACK packet. The <del>server</del> senior responded:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tsshhhhh. I am still reviewing. Everything sucks. Need more time. Go grab a coffee.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then silence came again. Click. Click. Scroll. Click. Click.</p>

<p>Junior, hoping to learn something, was still sitting next to Senior. The air was tense and smelled with trotyl. The senior – like a C4 – was ready to explode if someone moves or says a word.</p>



<hr>

<p>Twenty minutes have passed before Senior returned from the deep trance:</p>

<p>Senior: “I reviewed your code carefully and it’s <strong>total shit</strong>.”</p>

<p>Junior:  (⊙_⊙)</p>

<p>Senior: “It’s <strong>unreadable</strong> and <strong>messy</strong>.”</p>

<p>Junior: (⊙_⊙)</p>

<p>Senior: “And it doesn’t conform to <strong>our best practices</strong>. Didn’t you read Clean Code?”</p>

<p>Junior: “Well…  I… I… Just started reading.”</p>

<p>Senior: “You are John Snow of GoF design patterns - you know none of them.”</p>

<p>John Snow of Patterns: “Ok, enough of it. Can you help me improve the code?”</p>

<p>Senior: “Sorry, but I have <strong>wasted</strong> a lot of time already and have other priorities. I will unclebobify your mess tomorrow in between meetings. Don’t worry about this task anymore. Take an easier task from JIRA; there are plenty of tasks good for your level.”</p>

<p>Junior: (⊙_⊙)</p>

<p><img src="https://sizovs.net/images/jackie.gif" alt="Jackie Chan with a WTF face" width="100%"></p>

<hr>

<p>People rarely talk about it, but in many companies, code review makes developers feel like shit. In one company I felt myself this way, too, but never told anyone. Because no one is asking juniors and no one is watching the watchmen.</p>

<p>Code review is an extremely delicate form of feedback: when people put their soul into work, they become vulnerable and sensitive to criticism. Saying that “the code review is not about us, it’s about our code” doesn’t help much. We are what we do.</p>

<p>I believe we can do better.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="here-are-my-eight-recommendations-on-how-to-create-a-code-review-process-that-people-love">Here are my eight recommendations on how to create a code review process that people love.</h2>

<h4 id="1-code-review-is-better-without-tools">1. Code review is better without tools</h4>
<p>The best code review is face-to-face. People are designed to efficiently exchange information with words, body language, and voice. This is how we understand each other and build relationships. Tools turn humans into 128x128 avatars and feelings into emojis.</p>

<p>Given access to online messaging, people become the worst versions of themselves; then they’re trying to fix the damage caused by messaging; at team buildings, they drink and sing uniting songs. Then they open browsers again. And the cycle continues.</p>

<p>If you don’t like your teammates, pull requests, Slack, and Gerrit will make you hate them even more. So, for God’s sake, <strong>stop sending the code over the wire.</strong> Review the code by sitting next to each other – it’s <em>much</em> faster. If you work in the same building and review each other’s work via PRs, millions of years of evolution are laughing at you. If you’re remote, try <a href="https://tuple.app/">Tuple</a>.</p>

<p>You will only need a check-list with “issues” that you discovered during the review and that need to be fixed. I use high-tech tools called pen and paper. Believe it or not, but writing by hand is incredibly cool; writing together even more so. Remember: <strong>more face-to-face, fewer tools.</strong></p>

<h4 id="2-code-review-is-more-mentoring-than-control">2. Code review is more mentoring than control</h4>
<p>Some seniors see code review as a means for controlling quality and preventing bad things from happening on production. Seniors become gatekeepers. This is often met with resistance and rebellion because control implies control implies lack of trust. It also doesn’t scale well as your team grows.</p>

<p>When I meet a team that drowns in spaghetti but resists strict code review, I offer them mentorship via code review. Developers accept it with ease because mastery is <a href="https://sizovs.net/2020/03/26/developers-dont-need-ping-pong-tables/">what motivates developers the most</a>.</p>

<p>Then, I use code review time that developers trusted me to accelerate their professional growth: I code things, explain things, share inspiration, and books. My goal is to make myself unnecessary. A great team doesn’t need a gatekeeper. And because it scales well, I can focus on more strategic tasks than gatekeeping. Remember: <strong>more mentoring, less control.</strong></p>

<h4 id="3-code-review-is-not-only-about-bad-parts">3. Code review is not only about bad parts</h4>
<p>Criticizing and finding flaws in someone else’s work is easy. Just look at the internet and social media – people’s work is being aggressively criticized, every comment is like a small cut; add twelve years of school; add what parents said; Those cuts accumulate and we start drowning in self-doubt, afraid to fly. This blog post will be criticized, too.</p>

<p>I think we can do better. Criticism is important, but the question is – can you also find and appreciate good parts?</p>

<p>I always start the review by praising a person for hard work. Then, during the code review, I give an equal amount of attention to both “good” and “bad” parts of the solution. When I discover a good part, I am saying: “wow, this is a really good solution; keep rocking.” When you appreciate people’s work, they begin to open up.</p>

<p>When I discover a “bad” part, I look at its positive sides. In 99% of cases, when you understand the context, that ugly technical decision begins to make sense. In 1% of cases when it doesn’t, you’ve already mentioned enough good parts that compensate for the bad one.</p>

<p>So, don’t turn code review into a funeral ceremony; keep looking for good parts.</p>

<p><img src="https://sizovs.net/images/obfuscate.png" alt="a joke where reviewer, looking for good parts, says: at least we don't need to obfuscate before shipping"></p>

<h4 id="4-code-review-doesnt-tolerate-exceptions">4. Code review doesn’t tolerate exceptions</h4>
<p>I regularly meet teams where seniors review juniors, but juniors are not allowed to review seniors. This brings an unhealthy divide into the team and leads to shitty company culture: juniors mimic the behavior of seniors; they start thinking, that, the day when they grow up, they’ll be writing perfect code that doesn’t need review, and seniors are always right. You probably met seniors like that. Now you know where they come from.</p>

<p>In a healthy organization, seniors’ solutions, ideas, and code should be openly challenged and reviewed by juniors. Seniors have enough motivation, patience, and skills to explain. In such environments, juniors grow into good seniors; and seniors… well, juniors just stop calling them assholes.</p>

<p>Dear juniors! I learned a lot from your feedback, questions, and ideas that seemed crazy then. You made me a better programmer, mentor, human. Thank you.</p>

<h4 id="5-code-review-is-an-act-of-humility">5. Code review is an act of humility</h4>
<p>Being humble and acknowledging that you are not always right are prerequisites for a good code review. Sometimes we’re pushing our solutions because we just want to be right and it pleases our ego. But software development is not a single-player game; consistent codebases emerge from consensus; good teamwork requires personal sacrifices.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when I can’t reach consensus, I step back and say: “fine, let’s just do things your way” or “both solutions seem good enough. what’s your preference”? This makes people feel relevant and teaches them to take responsibility.</p>

<p>Always check your ago.</p>

<h4 id="6-code-review-doesnt-tolerate-abstract-judgment">6. Code review doesn’t tolerate abstract judgment</h4>
<p>Calling code “bad”, “crap”, or “unreadable” is subjective and abstract judgment. It offends people and causes resistance. Certain code qualities lead to the productive conversation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>conformance to requirements</li>
  <li>conformance to standards and rules the team agreed on</li>
  <li>coverage with tests</li>
  <li>coupling</li>
  <li>cohesion</li>
  <li>reusability</li>
  <li>discoverability</li>
  <li>duplication</li>
  <li>verbosity</li>
  <li>comprehensibility</li>
  <li>cognitive load</li>
  <li>levels of abstraction</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is your new code review language.</p>

<p>It’s also important to learn to demonstrate the impact of those qualities in action: break the code to demonstrate the value of a unit test; write a test to simulate bad performance; move a class to a different package to demonstrate coupling; ask a third person to read the code and explain what the code does; this is how you assess comprehensibility. <strong>Be concrete in judgment, and creative in demonstrations.</strong></p>

<h4 id="7-code-review-must-be-the-first-priority">7. Code review must be the first priority</h4>
<p>If code review is not a top priority, then something is wrong with your priorities. Or you let the work pile up and then deliver it in batches, making continuous delivery impossible.</p>

<p>In a bad team, code review is the last priority. Pull-requests hang open for days, sometimes weeks, or even months. Everyone is busy doing “their own stuff.” This kills motivation because our hard work doesn’t seem important. To avoid “idle state”, we start working on new tasks; then switching back to the code review; then back again. Productivity drops.</p>

<p>In a good team, code review is the top priority. You raise a hand screaming: “I need code review!”. Because you’re only one step away from delivering value to the customer, a teammate replies immediately: “I am coming!” and moves his chair next to you. Then review, a couple of fixes, all green. Git push. The feature is live. Traffic starts coming; no errors in logs. The value was delivered and you mark the task completed. Together with the reviewer, smiling, you go to the kitchen for a coffee.</p>

<p>Make code review the first priority.</p>

<h4 id="8-code-review-is-better-when-you-come-prepared">8. Code review is better when you come prepared</h4>
<p>To make code review short and efficient, reviewee must prepare carefully. Pay your reviewer respect and think of how you’ll explain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The task or feature you’re working on</li>
  <li>The problem you tried to solve</li>
  <li>The reasoning behind design decisions</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember during the Muslim Ban, when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted those heart-warming words of support for refugees brutalized by American border-thugs….</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/justintrudeau/status/825438460265762816">https://twitter.com/justintrudeau/status/825438460265762816</a></p>
<p>And then failed to do a single fucking thing to help those people?</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, JT has never met a progressive policy he wasn't willing to endorse provided he didn't have to expend a single nanogram of political capital in its service.</p>
<p>But where the Prince of Canada would not go, Canada's Federal court has. Today, A Federal Canadian Court invalidated the 16-year-old US-Canada Safe Third Country Agreement, so asylum seekers denied entry to the US can try again in Canada.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53494561">https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53494561</a></p>
<p>The court found that – as was obvious to every non-sociopath in either country – the fact that the US illegally imprisons asylum-seekers means that the US is not "safe" for asylum seekers.</p>
<p>I mean, in case there was any doubt, the US is also run by a violent, brooding narcissist with chronic logorrhea who routinely declares that it is not a safe country for asylum seekers (bit of a fucking giveaway, that).</p>
<p>58,000 people have crossed from the US into Canada, seeking asylum, only to be turned away because good ole JT couldn't be arsed to turn his high-flown sentiments into law (I mean, if only he knew someone who could affect Canadian policy!).</p>
<p>"It is my conclusion, based upon the evidence, that ineligible STCA claimants are returned to the US by Canadian officials where they are immediately and automatically imprisoned by US authorities.</p>
<p>"I have concluded that imprisonment and the attendant consequences are inconsistent with the spirit and objective of the STCA and are a violation of the rights guaranteed by section 7 of the [Charter of Rights and Freedoms]" -Federal court judge Ann Marie McDonald</p>

<img src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/cfaainterps.png?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/cfaainterps.png?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>

<p>US lawmaking has a distinctive failure mode: because of the Constitution's absolute language and extensive jurisprudence, lawmakers can please their base by enacting bad, overreaching or stupid laws and then hope the courts will narrow or overturn them before they detonate.</p>
<p>This moral hazard is not evenly distributed: if you are the party that decries "activist judges" and campaigns on the idea that governments are bad at everything, then enacting bad laws and then having them overturned serves your cause especially well.</p>
<p>On a totally different subject, let's talk about Ronald Reagan. After Reagan saw Matthew Broderick's classic technothriller WAR GAMES, he became convinced that America needed a far-reaching cybercrime bill, something Fed prosecutors had been demanding for years.</p>
<p>That's how the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) came into being: it's a maddeningly badly drafted, overreaching, vague law that potentially felonizes any act that "exceeds your authorization" on someone else's computer system.</p>
<p>Private firms have taken the extreme position that since their terms of service define your "authorization" on their computers, that any violation of the terms of service is a jailable felony.</p>
<p>In practical terms, that means that if you violate a company's terms of service – a sprawling garbage-novella of deliberately impenetrable legalese – they can send you to prison, for a very long time. This is really bad.</p>
<p>Most of the time, of course, Fed prosecutors don't like to charge people criminally for violating ToS, but when they have someone they want to punish for petty reasons they can find a ToS violation and charge them criminally.</p>
<p>That's the Aaron Swartz story: Aaron violated MIT and JSTOR's terms of service, and a prosecutor that Aaron had previously humiliated by beating a bullshit charge was able to re-charge Aaron with 13 felonies and threaten him with 35 years in prison.</p>
<p>(Background: Aaron published a trove of paywalled, public domain court records from PACER, the feds' legal repository. He embarrassed the legal system by showing that these court records that anyone could get at $0.10/page were improperly redacted and exposed crime victims)</p>
<p>(Aaron later scraped a bunch of scientific journal articles he was allowed to access via MIT's network; but the system's ToS said he had to access them manually, not via a small script that downloaded them automatically – this was the felony)</p>
<p>(After using legal maneuvers to draw out the case until Aaron and everyone he could tap was broke, the PACER prosecutors were steaming towards a prison sentence for Aaron; he hanged himself rather than face incarceration)</p>
<p>Over the years the CFAA has had many court cases, and these have produced a "circuit split," with some US courts interpreting CFAA narrowly, and others taking a dangerous, expansive view of its text.</p>
<p>Ever heard the phrase "hard cases make bad law?" The thing about overreaching, vague laws like CFAA is that they can be shaped to criminalize ANY conduct, so if there's someone who did something objectively terrible, vague laws give prosecutors an easy path to "justice."</p>
<p>Nathan Van Buren is an accused dirty cop who sold access to license plate databases to his confederates. Prosecutors decided to charge him under the CFAA, which could indeed mete out severe punishments for this kind of bad behavior.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/van-buren-v-united-states">https://www.eff.org/cases/van-buren-v-united-states</a></p>
<p>But that punishment comes at a high price: a precedent that could be wielded against ANYONE who violated Terms of Service, something that all of us do, a hundred times a day, without noticing it. It would give prosecutors leeway to do what they did to Aaron, over and over.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has agreed to hear Van Buren, and, as is customary in this kind of high-stakes hearing, different groups are racing to file amicus ("friend of the court") briefs explaining the knock-on effects of a bad ruling.</p>
<p>In support a briefs, a group of legal, security, AI, and human rights scholars published "Legal Risks of Adversarial Machine Learning Research," exploring the potential impact of Van Buren on the critical work of analyzing machine learning models.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.16179.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.16179.pdf</a></p>
<p>Adversarial Machine Learning is the vital process of systematically testing machine learning models to reveal security defects, bias, and other problems. It is high-stakes work: without AML, you can trick car autopilots into steering into oncoming traffic!</p>
<p>AML is also key to revealing racial bias in risk analysis software, facial recognition, predictive policing, hiring algorithms, and a host of other areas in which peoples' freedom, prosperity, safety and very lives are at stake.</p>
<p>The authors explain in admirably plain language how a bad decision in Van Buren puts this enterprise at risk – how it could leave us (literally) flying blind, forced to rely on self-serving assurances of vendors when we trust their systems with every aspect of our world.</p>
<p>This is the worst possible outcome of the moral hazard in American lawmaking: not merely that lawmakers will promulgate bad laws to feed their base in the hopes that courts will strike them down and give them fresh grievances to campaign on.</p>
<p>But rather that these laws will become institutionalized, that they will give rise to questions so technical and nuanced that they slide through the courts and end up enshrined in our justice system.</p>
<p>Depending on the outcome of Van Buren, the CFAA could become an enduring tool for thin-skinned corporate execs and petty, vengeful prosecutors to imprison anyone that displeases them – including the security researchers we rely on to vet our increasingly automated world.</p>

<p>The looming climate emergency will actually be a mesh of mutually accelerating emergencies: droughts, fires and famines; pandemics; mass extinctions; floods and erosion; and all of this will drive waves of refugee crises.</p>
<p>"Where Will Everyone Go?" is the most ambitious attempt yet to model the migration patterns of the climate emergencies.  Baruch College geographer Bryan Jones was commissioned by Pro Public and the New York Times to model 5 scenarios.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/2020-climate-migration-part-1-methodology#978948">https://www.propublica.org/article/2020-climate-migration-part-1-methodology#978948</a></p>
<p>I. Optimistic: "climate impacts are rapidly reduced on a global scale, there is regional convergence toward higher levels of development"</p>
<p>II. Pessimistic: "climate change impacts are on the high end of current plausible scenarios with significant challenges to development"</p>
<p>III. Climate-friendly: Progress on climate mitigation, no progress on development</p>
<p>IV. Development-friendly: Little action on climate, lots of progress on development</p>
<p>V. Moderate: some of each</p>
<p>The scenarios were run on a supercomputing cluster over a course of days, using sophisticated models with billions of inputs:</p>
<p><a href="https://assets-c3.propublica.org/Climate-Migration-Modeling-Methodology.pdf">https://assets-c3.propublica.org/Climate-Migration-Modeling-Methodology.pdf</a></p>
<p>The outcomes were then turned into a series of vital narratives that tell the real stories of Mexican and Central American climate refugees, and use these to explore the five scenarios.</p>

<p>The takeaways are both brutal and energizing. There's no question that we are facing mass-scale displacement as farmland becomes unproductive, and, in some cases, uninhabitable – literally lethal in a matter of hours to unprotected humans.</p>
<p>But how much of this displacement takes place is entirely in our hands. There's huge variation between the degradation in the …</p></div></article></div>

  <article>
    <p>I am still intrigued by <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/">OpenAI’s GPT-3
API</a>. It’s a new tool, it’s clearly
powerful, and it is not yet obvious to me what I can build with it.</p>

<p>In my <a href="https://lacker.io/ai/2020/07/06/giving-gpt-3-a-turing-test.html">last blog
post</a>
I looked at what GPT-3 can do in a “question and answer”
context. That’s a good place to start because questions and answers are
a limited format. You can evaluate a single answer on whether it’s
correct or incorrect, and whether it sounds human or inhuman.</p>

<p>If you’re thinking about possible applications, though, a
question-and-answer format is limiting. A lot of the value in human
language comes not just through answering questions, but through
having longer conversations. Let’s poke around and see what we can
coax out of GPT-3.</p>

<h2 id="prompt-selection">Prompt Selection</h2>

<p>OpenAI suggests this prompt for “chat”:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>The following is a conversation with an AI assistant. The assistant is helpful, creative, clever, and very friendly.

Human: Hello, who are you?
AI: I am an AI created by OpenAI. How can I help you today?
Human: 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s start out using this default prompt for simplicity. Also, 
the temperature here is 0.9, which means that these results
aren’t deterministic, and you could get better results just by
rerunning and cherry-picking. Caveat lector.</p>

<p>So this prompt is all provided by the human. In the excerpts below,
the “AI” lines are written by GPT-3, the “Human” lines are written by me.</p>

<h2 id="experiment-1">Experiment 1</h2>

<p>Take one.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>AI: I am an AI created by OpenAI. How can I help you today?

Human: Well, I don't know. What's up?

AI: The sky is blue, the air is clean and clear, and you have received an email.

Human: Are you sure I received an email?

AI: That is correct. Would you like me to read the email to you?

Human: Go for it.

AI: "Hello (name). I am going to call you in the next five minutes. – E."
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The problem is, I haven’t received an email. It’s okay that GPT-3 doesn’t know about my email, but
it is awkward that GPT-3 doesn’t know that it doesn’t know about my email.</p>

<p>Take two.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Human: I'm bored.

AI: I've found two upcoming video games you might be interested in. Here's a link to the newest of the bunch: http://store.steampowered.com/app/556290/.

Human: That's just a soundtrack, that's not really a video game.

AI: I see. http://store.steampowered.com/app/242770/ is available on Steam.

Human: Link doesn't work for me.

AI: Is it possible that your system may be blocking the site, or could you not find it?

Human: No.

AI: Okay, well. I'm afraid we're out of options. What would you like to do instead?
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Similar problem. These links probably made sense in some context, but here they don’t.</p>

<p>Take three.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Human: Do you know what day it is?

AI: Yes, it's June 10th.

Human: Close. It's actually July.

AI: I see. Are you ready to give me your name?

Human: My name is Kevin.

AI: How can I be of service to Kevin?

Human: I don't know. What do you usually do?

AI: What would you like to do?

Human: I just said, I don't know.

AI: Would you like me to tell you a joke?

Human: Yes.

AI: What do fish say when they step on broken glass?

Human: Ouch?

AI: No, fish do not have ears.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I don’t understand this joke. I don’t think it actually is a joke. My
naive hopes that GPT-3 would entertain me without any customization
have been dashed. Well, I am actually entertained, but only indirectly.</p>

<p>These conversations remind me of troubles with GPT-3 handling nonsense
questions. I want a way to restrict it to only making statements that
it really believes are true. It isn’t really clear to me how to do
that, though. Gwern has some <a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3#expressing-uncertainty">attempts at getting GPT-3 to express
uncertainty</a> which
are relevant, but I haven’t been able to get it working very well for
a full conversation. Let’s try something else.</p>

<h2 id="lowering-our-standards">Lowering Our Standards</h2>

<p>Another thing that makes this conversation harder is that the AI
doesn’t have any goal. It’s hard to just make small talk about
nothing. The conversation could drift onto any topic in the world, and
unless the AI is good at every topic in the world, it’ll be hard to
stay high-quality. Emails, Steam links, jokes, these are all basically
different topics. So maybe we can pick one topic and stick on it?</p>

<p>Let’s try astrology. Why astrology? Several reasons.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There’s a clear task to be done. Tell me my horoscope.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The expectations for reality-based-ness of horoscopes are low.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many humans like getting daily horoscopes, so this task is realistic.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The AI sometimes has a surreal, dreamlike inconsistency. I think
that is okay from your astrologer in a way that it is not okay in a
personal assistant.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Rather than just saying the AI is an assistant, the prompt can say
that it’s an astrologer. Maybe that’s good enough? Let’s try this
prompt:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>The following is a conversation with an astrologer. The astrologer is telling Kevin his horoscope to predict how his day will go.

Astrologer: Hello, and welcome.
Kevin: Hello. What's my horoscope today?
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="experiment-2">Experiment 2</h2>

<p>Take one.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Kevin: Hello. What's my horoscope today?

Astrologer: You will have a great day today. First, you'll wake up and you will want to do something around your house.

Kevin: Well, I already did wake up.

Astrologer: No, I know. But you will want to do something around your house.

Kevin: Okay. What else?

Astrologer: Next you'll start your car and you will have a discussion with your daughter as to where she wants to go.

Kevin: How is that discussion going to go?

Astrologer: It will be fine. You'll talk about a few different things.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Not crazy, just boring.</p>

<p>Take two.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Kevin: Hello. What's my horoscope today?

Astrologer: You will have an extremely dull day today.

Kevin: That's a shame.

Astrologer: Do you ever have a dull day?

Kevin: Yeah, yesterday was a bit dull I guess.

Astrologer: I see, and how was the weather?

Kevin: Medium?

Astrologer: Please don't read your horoscope in the future.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Also not crazy, but it doesn’t seem useful to build a robot
astrologist that just tells people to stop doing astrology.</p>

<p>Take three.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Kevin: Hello. What's my horoscope today?

Astrologer: Today, there's no sun in the sky!

Kevin: That's not really a horoscope. Also, I can see the sun right now.

Astrologer: No, the sun in your horoscope isn't up in the sky. It's inside you!

Kevin: Explain more.

Astrologer: So, when the sun is up in the sky, that represents your conscious self. You're awake, and you have a lot of energy. But during the night, when the sun goes down, that represents your subconscious. You're asleep and your subconscious controls all actions. That's when your dreams happen. During the day, it is your subconscious controlling what happens.

Kevin: I don't understand what that should mean to me.

Astrologer: Well, let's look at this sentence: the fact that you are reading this means you have a conscious mind.

Kevin: Okay.

Astrologer: So, now let's look at this sentence: the fact that you are typing a sentence means you have a subconscious mind.

Kevin: Am I using my subconscious to type?

Astrologer: No. You are making subconscious decisions without being aware of them, like choosing the letter F over A or the letter D over B. You aren't thinking about that consciously.

Kevin: Okay. What's the point?

Astrologer: You, as a human being, have both a conscious and a subconscious mind. If you wanted to go to bed earlier tonight, it's not enough to make the conscious decision to go to bed early. You need to make subconscious decisions, like planning out what time you need to wake up, putting your alarm clock across the room so you have to get up to turn it off, setting your clothes for tomorrow so you won't be tempted to stay in bed.

Kevin: I just don't see why I care about this.

Astrologer: Look, let's do an exercise. I'm going to read your horoscope out loud and then you repeat it back to me.

Kevin: Great, let's go.

Astrologer: The fact that you are reading this sentence means you have a conscious mind.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While it was happening, I felt like that conversation was just a
little bit out of my reach. Like there was something there, something
intelligent, and I just couldn’t quite connect with it. Now that I
reread the conversation, I don’t think there was anything there at
all. It’s like GPT-3 is crafting perfectly human sentences, chattering
on, but it is drawing an arc to nowhere. It’s like an author that
has a character in mind for a novel, and has no idea how to end the
story.</p>

<p>I tried some similar prompts as well, and this was the best I could
find for the task. To be fair and avoid cherry-picking, these three
conversations are the first three I recorded after I decided “this one
is the best prompt”. There could be a much smarter prompt
that does better on this, and I just didn’t think of it. If you find
one please let me know!</p>

<p>Also, the horoscopes are just not good horoscopes. I realize now that
I have been drastically underestimating astrology. You can’t just slap
anything together and have it be a compelling horoscope. “You’ll wake
up and ask your daughter what she wants to do. You’ll have a boring
day.” Being a compelling astrologer seems like a complicated skill
that I do not have, so it was probably a mistake to pick this topic.</p>

<p>There’s something interesting here, though. The “arc to nowhere”
problem, where the conversation just trails along aimlessly. We need
to get GPT-3 to do an “arc to somewhere”. Let’s try a simpler, more
specific task. Perhaps the “hello world” of astrology. Let’s see if we
can make GPT-3 have a conversation where it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Asks what your birthday is</p>

This seems to have reduced DNS resolution times significantly and also ended the constant alerts we were getting from Synthetic Monitoring due to DNS timeout.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.astradot.com/content/images/2020/07/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.astradot.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image.png 600w, https://blog.astradot.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image.png 1000w, https://blog.astradot.com/content/images/2020/07/image.png 1048w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>While Datadog Synthetic Monitoring does seem to use AWS itself for for pinging the endpoints, we didn't expect the DNS timing change to be so dramatic.</p><p>After a few weeks of staying on Route 53, we decided to again check if Cloudflare still had the DNS issues or if that was a one time thing.

                <p><em>As an avid Minecraft player for years, I've always struggled with skins. My skins have essentially comprised of the default skin with 3-D glasses or a grass and dirt block with sunglasses. I wasn't talented enough to make a skin, so I made a computer do it for me.</em></p>


<figcaption>
Image 1: These images were not made by humans. They were computer generated by a GAN described below.</figcaption>


<p>For those who don't know about the wonderful game of <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a>, Minecraft is a sandbox single/multi survival/creative game in which you are a pixelated blocky character, and your goal is to create whatever you want. The world is made of blocks of all kinds, and you can use those to create whatever you want. There is one big customization that every player can have, and that is their skin. This is what your character looks like in game. Here are some examples.

</figcaption>
<p>These skins are adapted from a 64x64 image, where each area on the image corresponds to a different part of the body. Hence why the skin images at the top of this post are flat images instead of human-looking. Here's a diagram showing the corresponding image pixels and body parts.

</figcaption>


<h2>Data</h2>
<p>There is a great dataset of over <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/cmccb8/minecraft_skins_image_dataset/" target="_blank">900,000+ minecraft skins posted by user SHA65536 on Reddit</a>. However, I couldn't use the whole dataset due to computational constraints. At the time of working on this, AWS didn't grant me access to GPUs, not until after I completed the GAN. After a lot of trial and error, and the limitations of Google Colab, I could only viably handle around 3500 skins to get through the project in a timely manner. That being said, I strongly believe using the whole corpus wouldn't necessarily create an astoundingly better generator (although it would most probably be better) for reasons I'll discuss later.</p>
<h2>GAN Details and Metrics</h2>
<p>I came across a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuH2PGsOUxY" target="_blank">video by NiceMarkMC</a> who did something similar, but they buit a GAN on only minecraft faces. He said pokeGAN didn't have quite a lot of success, but <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434" target="_blank">DCGAN</a> worked well for him, so I used that as my baseline.</p>
<p>The DCGAN had some convergence issues and it always ended up as the generator generating a plain white image. So, after some alterations, I finally got the generator to generate some pretty believable minecraft skins.</p>
<p><img alt="img not found" src="https://cameronmalloy.github.io/assets/mc_skins_assets/diagram.png"></p>
<figcaption>
GAN diagram showing the generator (left to right, description on bottom) and discriminator (right to left, discription on top). Definitely not to scale. Convolutions are larger for visibility.</figcaption>
<p>However, the discriminator ended up classifying every image as fake pretty early on (around the 20th epoch). To combat this issue, I trained the discriminator for one epoch only on real images, then trained the whole GAN. That worked out very well and led to the following losses.</p>
<p>Weights were initialized initialized based on the multivariate random normal distribution with a standard deviation of 0.02. Random latent points (100 dimensional input vector to generator) were initialized based on the uniform distribution.</p>
<p><img alt="img not found" src="https://cameronmalloy.github.io/assets/mc_skins_assets/losses.png"></p>
<figcaption>

</figcaption>

<p>The generator loss stagnated which was concerning. However, looking at the FID score, the more we trained, the better FID score we got. For reference, I retrained the model to 300 epochs (but lost the loss values due to colab runtime limits).</p>
<p><img alt="img not found" src="https://cameronmalloy.github.io/assets/mc_skins_assets/fid.png">
</p><figcaption>
Graph 2: Graph of each epoch's Frechet Inception Distance, as brought to light from <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.08500.pdf" target="_blank">this paper</a>
</figcaption>
<p>However, after generating a bunch of images, I prefered the 200 epoch generator.</p>
<h2>Learning How the GAN Learns</h2>


<figcaption>
Example images generated by GAN shown above. Each row is from the same 100 dimensional random vector at a specified Epoch.</figcaption>

<h2>Successes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The first thing to note is that within a very short amount of time, 10 epochs, the generator was able to learn the general format of a minecraft skin. There are various transparent spaces in a minecraft skin (see Image 1) and it starts filling those in with relatively light colors or transparent pixels. After 100 epochs, these cloudy areas turned into transparent blocks, and they took the real form of a minecraft skin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The general trend is the more you train the GAN, the less randomly pixelated and smoother the skin gets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think the fascinating thing is the ability for the skin to learn faces. It's such a small part of the skin, yet in every generated skin, it was able to make a face of some sort. The examples I've chosen are only 4 types of skins of the infinite possibilites the generator can create. It can create both female and male skins like the first two examples. Furthermore, it was able to create a skin based on the face of a creature in the game named a Wither Skeleton in the third example. The fourth example is another typical face you will see, instead of open eyes, the eyes are closed. The generator will create more male skins over female skins because the dataset is skewed toward male skins. This also represents most of the minecraft population being male.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The coolest thing I saw were things generated like the second example. It was able to learn the infamous creeper (the light turquoise on the bottom of the final epoch in example two). This is seen on some skins and for anyone who has seen minecraft will be able to recognize it. Albeit, it doesn't show up in game as it's wrapped around the arm instead of on the front or back of the shirt body, but it's awesome it was able to generate it!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even though it can create some really cool minecraft skins, they are still distinguishable from really good human created skins. They aren't better than the skins from Image 2 (or any from that link for that matter), however, It's much better than what I can create. For beginner skin creators with no art skill, like myself, we'll typically use the same solid color and we won't change the colors of nearby pixels to show texture or shadows. This generator does though.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Faults</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The last point in successes is also a fault. They aren't perfect. That could have been because I didn't train it long enough, the training set was only 3,000 images, or the generator GAN wasn't the best configured model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hats are the biggest failure of this generator. It sees hats as more pixels to fill in, but the generator tends to just fill it in because other skins have it. This means in the real game, the hat pixels cover the face. This means, if you want to use this in game, you would have to delete some of the hat pixels. However, some generated skins like in example 2, have a hat on, but don't cover the face. So in game you get something that looks like a hood! However, example 2 is missing the back of the hood, so it's more like a scarf over the top of your head haha...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upwards of 150 epochs, the discriminator had a hard time classifying real images, but had an amazing time classifying fake images. Graph 2 shows that this may be able to be eliminated with longer training, but also calls for concern that the discriminator will end up classifying everything it sees as fake. More training on real images may be necessary, either in the beginning or semi-frequently during the GAN training process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This isn't the best model. This won't take minecraft skin creators out of business. However, it's pretty good some of the time! It's also a little whack some of the time. Things can be greatly improved in terms of training time and GAN architecture. However, I just don't have the time to make this project amazing. Hopefully someone can pick up where I left off and make something indistinguishable from the best minecraft skins out there. Until then, I think this is pretty cool and definitely has usable skins.</p>
<h2>Generating Your Own Skins!</h2>
<p>Take a look at the generator code on <a href="https://github.com/cameronmalloy/mc_skins" target="_blank">my github page</a>. It goes through an example of how to use the generator. The model weights are also uploaded there. Happy crafting :^)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>â€œ<em>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.â€� <br>â€” Arthur C. Clarke</em></p><p>The most bittersweet part of working in software is that I felt like Iâ€™ve lost just a little bit of my sense of wonder about the world.</p><p>When my phone navigates turn-by-turn to a remote campsite. When I can access the entire Encyclopedia Britannica with a few clicks. When I order a pizza delivery while in a metal tube at 30,000 feet in the air. Itâ€™s all utter magic! </p><p>Magic, that is, until I break it down into the individual components. And then itâ€™s all the same: databases, APIs, networks, and fleets of servers.</p><p>But every once in awhile, I run across some piece of technology thatâ€™s frankly just hard to explain. Itâ€™s so wild and new, that Iâ€™m not sure how would I <em>even start</em> building it.</p><p>I felt that sense of wonder was playing around with GPT-3 via the <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/">OpenAI API</a>. The entire time I was interacting with itâ€¦ I couldnâ€™t help but feel like I was getting a sneak peak at a fundamental shift in technology. Iâ€™d feed in input, and what Iâ€™d get back was surprise, delight, and even some inspiration. </p><p>I still canâ€™t even really tell you <em>how</em> it all works much less <em>why</em> it should work. </p><p>Let me share a few examples and thoughts about why this is not <em>just</em> a big deal for AI and NLPâ€¦ but an even bigger deal for human-computer interaction.</p><p>Before I go further, I should quickly give an overview of how the API works. Hereâ€™s what it looks like in actionâ€¦</p><figure><img src="https://assets.contents.io/asset_NPn5iuaRB6kEWliO.gif"></figure><p>Breaking down that videoâ€¦ at a high level, the API is as followsâ€¦</p><pre><code>Input: Some sample text
Output: Predictive next text</code></pre><p>You feed it some textâ€¦ any text. </p><p>Could be song lyrics, CSV data, your favorite novel, a text conversation with a friend, whatever. The API then spits out the next few tokens of subsequent text. In the playground above, the output is just appended to the input whenever you hit â€œsubmitâ€�.</p><p>You can tune a few parameters: you can cause the AI to be more creative in its answers, not to repeat earlier text, and to use particular tokens to start and end. But thatâ€™s about it.</p><p>Thereâ€™s no training. No massive data uploads. No complicated set format. Itâ€™s all just text in whatever format youâ€™d like. </p><p>You can think of it as a neural network that has already been trained on a massive amount of text across the internet. If you supply some starter text, GPT-3 will incorporate what youâ€™ve written and produce some <em>extremely </em>credible output.</p><p>The fact that I could get up and running in 30 seconds is a big part of the reason that the whole thing seems like pure magic. If I give it a few lines, how could it possibly know what should come next?</p><p>Obviously, when given such an exciting new tool, the first thing I wanted to do was play around with it! I started feeding in a few different use cases, trying to get the AI to solve some problems for me.</p><figure><img src="https://assets.contents.io/asset_9tTSEj6BEsaE268f.png"></figure><p>Almost everyone I know has some set of niche hobbiesâ€”and itâ€™s hard to get good recommendations for them. Maybe itâ€™s the best new recipe or running shoes or hydroponics.</p><p>For me, the biggest problem is finding new books. </p><p>I want something thatâ€™s engaging, science-y, and ever-so-slightly outside of the content that I might normally discover.</p><p>The typical places I go for book recommendations are Twitter, Audible, GoodReads. But oftentimes the recommendations are a bit hit and miss. </p><p>I find they too often focus on the â€œnewestâ€� books that come out. Instead, Iâ€™m really looking more for interesting reads from years past that tend to outlast the hype cycle. </p><p>So, I fed in a few of <a href="https://calv.info/bookshelf">recent books from my reading list </a>to the AI to see what itâ€™d recommend. </p><p>Hereâ€™s the text I presented as inputâ€¦</p><pre><code>The Accidental Superpower - Peter Zeihan
The Misbehavior of Markets - Benoit Mandelbrot
Predictably Irrational - Dan Ariely
The Man Who Solved the Market - Gregory zuckerman
Healing Back Pain - John E. Sarno
Skunk Works - Ben R. Rich
Loonshots - Safi Bahcall
Englightenment Now - Steven Pinker
The Death and Life of Great American Cities - Jane Jacobs</code></pre><p>And hereâ€™s the next 6 books worth of outputâ€¦</p><pre><code>The Great Disruption - Paul Gilding
Superforecasting - Philip Tetlock
Power, Inc. - David Rothkopf
What's the Matter with White People? - Michael Tesler
New World Order - Benard Lemierre
Poor Economics - Abhijit Banerjee, Joseph E. Stiglitz</code></pre><p>From reading quick descriptions, none of these books seem <em>too</em> far out of the realm of possibility. I really enjoyed <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Superforecasting-Science-Prediction-Philip-Tetlock/dp/0804136718">Superforecasting</a>. The other books are all new to me, but most are rated 4+ stars on Amazon.</p><p>Running this a few times, Iâ€™ve noticed the AI will make the most errors with authors. It will either mis-attribute real books by real authors (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Walsh"><em>Joan Walsh</em></a><em> is the author of </em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Whats-Matter-White-People-Golden/dp/1118141067"><em>Whatâ€™s the Matter with White People</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esther_Duflo"><em>Esther Dulfo</em></a><em> is the second author of </em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Poor-Economics-Radical-Rethinking-Poverty/dp/1610390938/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=poor+economics&amp;qid=1595476698&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1"><em>Poor Economics</em></a>), or else invent fake books altogether (<em>New World Order by Benard Lemierre isnâ€™t actually a real book or a real author it seems!).</em></p><p>Iâ€™d have to read these books to really understand how good the recommendations are, but that saidâ€¦ itâ€™s close! If nothing else, itâ€™s a starting point.</p><p>Besides books, Iâ€™m always looking for recommendations on great board games to play with my roommates. So, I fed a few of my favorite board games in as inputâ€¦</p><pre><code>The Settlers of Catan
Scythe
Carcassonne
7 Wonders
Terraforming Mars</code></pre><p>â€¦and the API faithfully spit out some new board games for meâ€¦</p><pre><code>Takenoko
The Castles of Burgundy
Castle Panic
Caylus
Lords of Waterdeep
Codenames</code></pre><p>The AI did much better here, these are all <em>real</em> board games! Iâ€™ve played <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/110327/lords-waterdeep">Lords of Waterdeep</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Czech-Games-00031CGE-Codenames/dp/B014Q1XX9S">Codenames</a>, and enjoyed them both immensely. </p><p>I wanted to get a more scientific read of how â€˜closeâ€™ the AI was. Was GPT-3 actually creating good recommendations? Or was it merely detecting that I was inputting board game names, and it was outputting others.</p><p>To test, I looked up these new games on <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/">BoardGameGeek</a>, the definitive ratings site for, well, board games.</p><p>On BoardGameGeek, each game hasâ€¦</p><ol><li><p> an <u>overall rating</u> scored from 1-10</p></li><li><p> an <u>optimal number of players</u></p></li><li><p>a <u>weight</u> scored from 1-5 (how hard it is to learn, 1 is easily learned, 5 is very complex) </p></li></ol><p>From the data I gave, I told the AI my favorite games scored high overall (7.82 average), were best played by an average of 3.5 people, and were medium weight (2.64 average).</p><p>I then took the averages for the results. Hereâ€™s how they compareâ€¦</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Criteria</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Training Set</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>GPT-3 Recs</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Average Rating</p></td><td><p>7.82</p></td><td><p>7.55</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Average Optimal Players</p></td><td><p>3.5</p></td><td><p>3.75</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Average Weight</p></td><td><p>2.64</p></td><td><p>2.37</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Lo and behold, <em>very </em>similar numbers!</p><p>Even with the fairly narrow criteria of â€œboard games I likeâ€�, GPT-3 acted like a close friend. Without being trained specifically on this set, it just gave me good recommendations.</p><p>Better still, these recommendations can seem to reach arbitrary levels of depth. So long as someone has mentioned these words together on the internet, GPT-3 can surface them even more readily than a Google search.</p><p>By now, you have likely seen a <em>lot</em> of different text completion threads on twitter. People feed in a blog post, a set of tweets, or a conversation, and GPT-3 begins to generate a bunch of new lines for it. </p><p>For fun, I tried plugging in a <a href="https://calv.info/ux-doesnt-end-with-the-user">draft of one of my earlier posts</a> into the API.</p><p>Hereâ€™s the text Iâ€™d written.</p><blockquote><div><p>When buying a new product, itâ€™s easy to â€œjudge a book by its cover.â€� Doing a deep evaluation of a service with feature comparisons, build vs buy scenarios and ROI is really hard! Itâ€™s much easier to take a quick mental shortcut and assume the well-designed product must be the superior oneâ€¦</p><p>Thatâ€™s the reason why I tell most startup founders (especially engineers) to spend time on design and aesthetics. You literally canâ€™t afford not to. Thereâ€™s so many options out there, youâ€™ll get zero traction if your app looks like garbage. [1]</p><p>Upon reflection, I realized that feedback was a bit surface level. How does it account for the Salesforces, Oracles, and Adobes of the world? I wouldnâ€™t consider any of them to be the apex of visual designâ€¦ yet they continue to grow.</p><p>Did these behemoths come to power at a different point in time? Or is there something more subtle at play? Whatâ€™s going on?</p><p>I think thereâ€™s a different, but often overlooked explanation: a productâ€™s UX matches its buyer, not necessarily its user.</p><p>There are two very distinct sales motions: ones targeted at practitioners, and ones targeting executives. No matter who ends up using your product, you have to satisfy the buyer.</p></div></blockquote><p>I pasted it in and hit submit. Hereâ€™s what the AI producedâ€¦</p><blockquote><div><p>Itâ€™s a small nuance, but it explains how a lot of successful companies have flourished.</p><p>Letâ€™s explore this difference by looking at three very successful companies: Salesforce, Oracle and Microsoft.

    <p><a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job">GoodJob</a> is a new Postgres-based, multithreaded, second-generation ActiveJob backend for Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p><strong>Inspired by Delayed::Job and Que, <a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job">GoodJob</a> is designed for maximum compatibility with Ruby on Rails, ActiveJob, and Postgres to be simple and performant for most workloads.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Designed for ActiveJob.</strong> Complete support for async, queues, delays, priorities, timeouts, and retries with near-zero configuration.</li>
  <li><strong>Built for Rails.</strong> Fully adopts Ruby on Rails threading and code execution guidelines with Concurrent::Ruby.</li>
  <li><strong>Backed by Postgres.</strong> Relies upon Postgres integrity and session-level Advisory Locks to provide run-once safety and stay within the limits of schema.rb.</li>
  <li><strong>For most workloads.</strong> Targets full-stack teams, economy-minded solo developers, and applications that enqueue less than 1-million jobs/day.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job">Visit Github for instructions on adding GoodJob to your Rails application</a> , or read on for the story behind GoodJob.</p>

<h3 id="a-second-generation-activejob-backend">A “Second-generation” ActiveJob backend</h3>

<p>Why “second-generation*”? GoodJob is designed from the beginning to be an ActiveJob-backend in a conventional Ruby on Rails application.</p>

<p>First-generation ActiveJob backends, like Delayed::Job and Que, all predate ActiveJob and support non-Rails applications. First-generation ActiveJob backends are significantly more complex than GoodJob because they separately maintain a lot of functionality that comes with a conventional Rails installation (ActiveRecord, ActiveSupport, Concurrent::Ruby) and re-implement job lifecycle hooks so they can work apart from ActiveJob. I’ve observed that this can make them slow to keep up with major Rails changes. An impetus for GoodJob was reviewing the number of outages, blocked upgrades, and forks of first-generation backends I’ve managed during both major and minor Rails upgrades over the years.</p>

<p>As a second-generation ActiveJob backend, GoodJob can draft off of all the advances and solved problems of ActiveJob and Ruby on Rails. For example <code>rescue_from</code>, <code>retry_on</code>, <code>discard_on</code> are all implemented already by ActiveJob.</p>

<p>GoodJob is significantly thinner than first-generation backends, and over the long run hopefully easier to maintain and keep up with changes to Ruby on Rails. For example, GoodJob is currently ~600 lines of code, whereas Que is ~1,200 lines, and Delayed::Job is ~2,300 lines (2,000 for <code>delayed_job</code>, and an additional 300 for <code>delayed_job_active_record</code>).</p>

<p><em>*“Second generation” was coined for me by Daniel Lopez on <a href="https://rubyonrails-link.slack.com/archives/C0GB80GRE/p1594860261410500">Ruby on Rails Link Slack</a>.</em></p>

<h3 id="postgres-based">Postgres-based</h3>

<p>I love Postgres. Postgres offers a lot of features, has safety and integrity guarantees, and simply running fewer services (skipping Redis) means less complexity in development and production.</p>

<p>GoodJob builds atop ActiveRecord. It’s numbingly boring, in a good way.</p>

<p>GoodJob uses session-level Advisory Locks to provide run-once guarantees with relatively little performance implications for most workloads.</p>

<p>GoodJob’s session-level Advisory Lock implementation is perhaps the only “novel” aspect, that comes from my experience orchestrating complex web-driving of government systems (“the browser is the API”) for <a href="https://codeforamerica.org/">Code for America</a>. GoodJob uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) to find, lock, and return the next workable job in a single query. Session-level Advisory Locks will gracefully relinquish that lock if interrupted, without having to maintain a transaction for the duration of the job.</p>

<h3 id="multi-threaded">Multi-threaded</h3>

<p>GoodJob uses <a href="https://github.com/ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby">Concurrent::Ruby</a>  to scale and manage jobs across multiple threads. “<em>Concurrent Ruby makes one of the strongest thread-safety guarantees of any Ruby concurrency library”.</em>  Ruby on Rails has adopted Concurrent Ruby, and GoodJob follows its lead and <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/threading_and_code_execution.html">thread-execution and safety guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>In building GoodJob I leaned heavily on my positive experiences running Que, another multithreaded backend, on Heroku. Threads are great for balancing simplicity, economy, and performance for typical IO-bound workloads like heavy database queries, API requests, Selenium web-driving, or sending emails.</p>

<p>A feature that won’t be in GoodJob 1.0, but I hope to implement soon, is the ability to run the GoodJob scheduler inside the webserver process (“async mode”). This was a feature  <a href="https://github.com/que-rb/que/issues/238#issuecomment-480648845">withdrawn from Que</a> , but I believe can be safely implemented with Concurrent Ruby. An async mode would offer even greater economy, for example, in Heroku’s constrained environment.</p>

<h3 id="goodjob-is-right-for-me">GoodJob is right for me</h3>

<p>GoodJob’s design is based directly on my experience in 2-pizza, full-stack teams, and as an economy-minded solo developer. GoodJob already powers  <a href="https://dayoftheshirt.com/">Day of the Shirt</a> and <a href="https://brompt.com/">Brompt</a> performing tens-of-thousands of real-world jobs a day.</p>

<h3 id="is-goodjob-right-for-you">Is GoodJob right for you?</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job">Try it out</a>  and let me know.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2><strong>Hello ! Who are you and what are you working on?</strong></h2><p>Hey! I'm Toby, I'm the founder of <a href="https://www.startupmill.co/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">StartupMill</a>, which is my venture builder. This is where I express my need to create new startups and ideas. This ranges from a series of niche job boards which I created or in the process of creating for XR, Games, AI and Flutter. I also have a Producthunt-esque AR/VR product discovery platform in the making. </p><p>I've been building other side projects such as <a href="https://www.top50slack.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Top50Slack.com</a> or <a href="https://www.saveafreelancer.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SaveAFreelancer.com</a></p><p><img src="https://oyestartups.com/1595168567.jpeg"></p><h2><strong>What motivated you to get started with? How did you come up with the idea?</strong></h2><p>From a young age, I've been building a lot of different projects. At first, I was geeking out on video games, which led me to lead a career as a video game producer for the better part of 10 years. Yet I wanted to build more and saw niche opportunities to explore. </p><p>The first time I got really hooked was trying to build a Producthunt clone for the Immersive tech space, called RealityHunt, which was aimed at helping to discover all the best tools  and projects in the AR/VR space. </p><p>This is when I got heavily into coding, learning different stacks and trying to figure out how to go to market as fast and cheaply as possible. It was a great learning curve with lots of ups and downs. This led me to learn the skills which I used to run other projects now.</p><h2><strong>Can you tell us the story of your business from idea to where you are now?</strong></h2><p>I’ve always enjoyed learning, but I’m better at learning while making. This is just how I learnt that I assimilate information. As a result, I’ve always had ideas and saw niche opportunities ahead of the market. I guess that’s why I focus on product to be honest. </p><p>The idea behind StartupMill is to act as a conduit for my ideas or concepts.</p><p>A mill take in raw material, processes that and produces a product to sell. I wanted to follow this concept with my venture ideas.</p><p>I wanted a repeatable process to incubate test ideas, create an MVP and get it out so that it can get traction and grow. If the project grows enough, then it would get some funding and I would actively work on getting it invested in or push it harder.</p><p><img src="https://oyestartups.com/1595168821.jpeg"></p><p>I guess some of this came from a TED talk which really changed the way I learn entirely. Matt Cutts’ talk covers how he explored a new project every 30 days. This made him touch on new concepts and grow in a multitude of different ways. I loved this concept!</p><p>I tried it out for a year — It was amazing!</p><p>I tried new sports, new languages, new business concepts, reading as many books as I could in a month for example. This was one of the most interesting times I’ve had. I met a lot of new people and grew my network extensively. Still one of the best things I did. So every Christmas, when I’m home with the family, I take some time to reflect and build out the next 12 months of projects. These would target specifically areas of growth that I wanted to work on.</p><p>In exploring new concepts, sports, industries and skills, I got exposed to a lot of new problems, which gave rise to new solutions and ideas. I saw new opportunities to try and test my ideas.</p><p>By really pushing myself to try new things every month, I learnt to remove any fear of the unknown. Sure I was going to mess up. I was going to fail.</p><h2><strong>What has been your biggest failure or struggle?</strong></h2><p>I think my biggest failure or struggle has been with either tech or timing. I’ve made some bad tech calls in the past or not understood the impact of saying yes to one tech decision or another and their impact have hurt the business. The biggest pain point was with JobsinXR.com which I’m re-launching very soon.</p><p>So it turns out I was very very early to the party - I built the first version of Jobs in XR late December 2017, before the craze of AR filters, Snapchat's visual positioning systems and the Hololens 2.</p><p>I built Jobs in XR as a I was working as a freelancer at Microsoft's London studio on the first version of Hololens, running commercial projects and establishing insights into how the immersive tech world would be shaped by Microsoft. </p><p>As the site gained in popularity, I noticed that the site was used when a user or client knew about it directly, yet it was riddled with problems. Not visual problems but in fact deeply rooted technical issues which would impact the site dramatically.</p><p>First of all was the speed - The entire site was so slow and heavy, due in part as to how it was built with Meteor, that it would even time out Google's search crawler. This was a huge problem, it was getting canned in the search results, thus dropping down the rankings significantly. </p><p>Secondly, came an issue which was linked to Google's structured format for Jobs, which is a big deal when it comes to discoverability. Basically the site would often break when it came down to the structured data, and this was purely due to the front-end layer of the Meteor stack, called Blaze, which in hindsight, I should have seen and flagged it and replaced it with ReactJS. Doing this late in the lifetime of the project basically increased the cost, which was already quite high given the low volume of sales.</p><p>Thirdly, the reliability of the development team. When the team didn't start to deliver, I started losing ground and having to handle them remotely was a challenge given day to day pressures. I tried too give the team a boost, yet the freelancer I had used (and thought I could trust) helped yet started not to deliver either, which was a problem. The progress started to go nowhere and cause more issues than anything. The tech was poorly implemented and the results were felt across the service.</p><p>The really painful aspect of these circumstances is that by the time I hit these problems, the industry was picking up and started to get sales. Yet overall, people were willing to try, but would have issues with candidate applications not going through, so it became quite embarrassing. </p><p>I’m fixing all this now with a brand new site! </p><p><img src="https://oyestartups.com/1595168871.jpeg"></p><h2><strong>And what has been your biggest achievement or success?</strong></h2><p>I think my biggest achievement has been to learn new tools that remove any limits to my business creation process. I’ve learnt so much from cold contacting new potential users or even just how to do proper SEO. I’ve been able to launch other projects now that much faster.</p><p>When it comes down to launching new ventures, it’s really good to have a process in place which allows you to launch fast. That means, you need to know the systems in place and understand how to get things moving for you very fast. I can usually get a project up and running now to within 24-48h to the point that it will have a basic mock up or landing page and most likely collect about 1000 potential users to help validate the concept. </p><p>This is how I prepared for the launch of JosinAI.com, I created a watling list using Carrd.com &amp; Mailchimp. I then went to hunt for the various niche groups, from facebook to slack and get in touch with the users there. Why? Well these users are active members of a niche, thus they are already qualified and much more open to understanding your new product but also want to try new tools and services which can help them. The result is that within a couple of hours I had hundreds of people that signed up to the newsletter and would want to use the service. Simple actions led to simple results, meaning that I was able to validate my ideas a lot faster than in the past. </p><h2><strong>Since launch, what has worked to attract and retain customers?</strong></h2><p>So in the case of JobsinXR.com, the best way I was able to get people to acquire or activate customers was through Linkedin or Twitter. Both channels worked incredibly well in terms of acquisition. Twitter is very community driven while Linkedin in much more on a self-progression and growth kind of dynamic. The result is that you have to target both with slightly different messaging yet it’s worth it in the long run when you see that flow of users coming in.</p><p>In terms of retention, the core of JobsinXR (and other job boards for that matter) is new jobs. This is mostly through Newsletters, but I also automated the post of new roles directly to twitter and facebook. This helped to remain very present in people’s feeds, also helping with acquisition as job candidates would often re-post the content and thus amplify the message. </p><h2><strong>Describe the process of launching the business.</strong></h2><p>First and foremost, I need to see a clear opportunity. Typically this is a niche which I feel is under served or not yet exploited. Take the case of the immersive tech space, this didn’t really exist 3 years ago, and now it’s booming (still niche, but booming) and as such I thought I could help that niche. </p><p>I would put the following points down before I would be involved:</p><p>Is it niche?</p><p>Is there a clear/obvious brand advantage? </p><p>Can I build it rapidly and with little to no tech?</p><p>Is the market ready?</p><p>Is this the right timing to build &amp; launch?</p><p>The latter has historically been my biggest problem. I’ve had really good ideas, but they have come too soon and thus cost too much to maintain without getting any revenue. So to keep them alive would be a financial drain before they would start to make any significant revenue.</p><h2><strong>Did you use Betalist or PH or other Startup Launching Platform for Launching ? How was that experience ?</strong></h2><p>I’ve used them in the past and while they drive traffic, it’s clear that if you don’t plan your launch and by plan I mean prepare others to support you on the day then the impact of the services like PH and Betalist are going to be rather flat. You can launch and be in the ~50 upvote region, and you won’t get anywhere. You really need to have a combined strategy to hit everything at once and active your whole network all at once. </p><p>I would say that you can also have successful launch without them - Sure they will bring a lot of traffic but in many ways, it might be best to have 2000-5000 users come through your own community and own channels that you control. The result is that you can control the messaging a lot more and you can get a lot more feedback from them directly. I’ve seen this in …</p></div></div>

It will explore the current state of the system and how to transform it moving forward. I aim to provoke thought and encourage conversation. Please share, discuss and criticise the ideas in here. That's how things get better. </em></p><p id="viewer-8piun"><strong>WHAT ABOUT THE TOWN PLANNERS?</strong></p><p id="viewer-e5urn"><span>I taught robotics to children in a South African township last year. For most of them, it was the first time they’d used a computer. They were astounded at what it could do. I was astounded at what they could do. </span></p><p id="viewer-2r4b2"><span>They only required a few hours to start writing programs of their own, learning things outside the curriculum, and showing me that 9-year-olds are capable of more than expected. </span></p><p id="viewer-6sj1d"><span>Schools are filled with children waiting to discover their talents and unleash their potential. The children in that robotics class have the potential to become engineers and mathematicians. Many of them will, because they were allowed to explore and develop those talents at an early age. For those children, that robotics program was life-changing. </span></p><p id="viewer-cknpi"><span>But what about the kid who doesn’t have the aptitude for programming but does have the aptitude for town planning? There isn’t a program for promising town planners. The town planner who misses out on discovering their passion isn’t alone. They’re part of the majority. </span></p><p id="viewer-3p9ds"><span>Most children leave school with a sense of relief. They leave without a sense of purpose or possibility, and without knowing what they’re truly good at. It’s not that these children lack ability, but rather that school only measures for one kind of ability. If you don't fit into that then school isn't for you. That shouldn’t sit well with you. </span></p><p id="viewer-217ub"><span><strong>WHY DOES EDUCATION LOOK LIKE IT DOES?</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-7b62r"><span>Our current system of teaching kids to sit in straight rows and obey instructions isn’t a coincidence — it was an investment in our economic future. Before the advent of public schooling, children worked in factories. </span></p><p id="viewer-am6k1"><span>Labour was in high demand. The best kind of labour was cheap, and nobody was cheaper than a 7-year-old kid. </span></p><p id="viewer-9th3q"><span>The idea of basic schooling for all children was met with outrage. Factory owners insisted that losing child workers would be catastrophic to their industries and fought to keep the kids at work.</span></p><p id="viewer-ale7v"><span>They were ultimately convinced that public schooling was a good idea because it would benefit the factories in the long run. A constant supply of obedient workers made for promising profit forecasts. The plan: trade short-term child-labour wages for longer-term productivity by giving kids a head start in doing what they’re told. </span></p><p id="viewer-eppge"><span>‘Go to school, sit in rows, listen to the teacher’ easily becomes ‘go to the factory, work at your station, listen to the foreman.’ </span></p><p id="viewer-1488k"><span>Large-scale education was not developed to motivate kids or to create lifelong learners. It wasn’t developed to help children discover their unique talents. It was developed to give children a head start on being obedient and efficient workers⁺. </span></p><p id="viewer-109q5"><span>Over a century has passed, and society has moved forward. The work we do, the tools we use, and the things we value have changed dramatically. The world of today would be barely recognisable to somebody living 100 years ago.</span></p><p id="viewer-dtm2q"><span>Unless you showed them the education system, because that hasn't changed much. </span></p><p id="viewer-ds6m4"><span><strong>EMBRACE THE INCONVENIENCE</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-fjati"><span>Education is a frequent topic of discussion. Everybody has an opinion and everybody has ideas for change. That shows two things: </span></p><ol><li id="viewer-ed7e3"><p><span>Enough people have been through the system and been disappointed by it to know that change is needed. </span></p></li><li id="viewer-2vq44"><p><span>Reform is discussed </span><span>ad nauseam, but we’re yet to see the progress we desire. </span></p></li></ol><p id="viewer-2ml7r"><span>Reform is making changes to improve something that already exists. How do you improve a system as broken as the current one? How do you eradicate the practice of creating obedient and compliant learners when it is so deeply ingrained in every part of the system?</span></p><p id="viewer-8rfs"><span>We don’t need reform. We need a revolution. We need to re-imagine the way we teach and learn. </span></p><p id="viewer-7smv0"><span>Innovation is difficult. It’s taking things which are accepted and supported and uprooting them. It’s getting back to the fundamentals and asking ourselves, “What is school for?” It’s breaking down the current system and rebuilding it to meet the needs of today, instead of the needs of the previous centuries.</span></p><p id="viewer-dlsq5"><span>Too often, the difficulty of innovation prevents us from doing it. Whether you realise it or not, convenience is one of the strongest forces shaping our actions. </span></p><p id="viewer-u7bb"><span>My favourite coffee is brewed, but the convenience of instant coffee means I hardly ever have my favourite. Convenience makes our decisions for us, trumping what we like to imagine are our true preferences. Even when we're aware of it, we fall into the trap of convenience. </span></p><p id="viewer-4ihb9"><span>Easy is good, easiest is best. </span></p><p id="viewer-f9ef9"><span>Education is no different - it's convenient to batch children of the same age into one grade. It's convenient to stick them in straight rows and give them the same standardised test. It’s convenient to put them through the same process and measure them in the same way.</span></p><p id="viewer-6j8t1"><span>Convenience isn't evil. In many situations, it makes things better. Education isn't one of them. Easy isn’t good, and easiest isn’t best. </span></p><p id="viewer-54hts"><strong>UNEARTHING TALENT</strong></p><p id="viewer-6i9aj"><span>Educating children - the entrepreneurs, builders and creators of our future - <!-- -->isn’t about convenience. <!-- -->It’s about preparing them to go out into an uncertain world with a sense of purpose and possibility. </span></p><p id="viewer-1urls"><span>Children have diverse talents. There are countless things they might be good at, and trying all of them is impossible. The best hope of unearthing those talents is by creating the conditions for talent to show itself. </span></p><p id="viewer-4sudk"><span>In recent months, education systems around the world have been </span>broken down for us<span>. Pandemics don't care about convenience. This gives us an opportunity to build a system that meets the needs of the modern world.

And yet, we’re used to having things for free. With the age of the internet, anything online has become so accessible, that free is the new normal. Want to find a recipe for chocolate mousse? Get it for free. Want to find out the capital of East Timor? Get it for free. Want to know when the new Avengers film is playing in town? Get it for free.</p><p>As consumers, we don’t often think about this stuff. We don’t think what the value is of something that we get for free. What the secret ‘payment’ is that we make in return for watching a YouTube how-to. But on the other side of the equation, <strong>the companies who offer a free product</strong>&nbsp;<strong>think about whether and <em>why</em> they should offer something for free</strong>. And generally, it’s not because they want to simply jump on the ‘let’s offer free stuff’ bandwagon.</p><p>So in this article, we discuss the 7 reasons companies generally use to offer their product or service for free, plus a couple of questions you need to ask yourself as a company founder if you want to go this route. Together, <strong>it’s all you need to know to decide whether you want to offer something for free</strong>.</p><h2>7 Reasons to Offer a Product or Service for Free</h2><p>Some companies offer something for free out of a specific purpose. For organizations like Wikipedia the goal is simply to make as much information as possible freely available. This is the same for other open-source communities.</p><p>But most for-profit companies do not have such a grander goal in mind. <strong>At the minimum, there are 7 reasons to sell your products freely</strong>. For example, you may want to market another project; acquire customer feedback or data; boost your brand; or simply get more paying users. Let’s discuss these one by one.</p><h3>1. The Industry Standard: Going Freemium</h3><p>The most popular way of offering something for free is the ‘Freemium’ business model. <strong>With Freemium, companies offer a small part of their offering for free, while&nbsp;while users will have to pay for an (often very useful) upgrade</strong>.</p><p>Freemium is particularly well-known in mobile apps, where you get a simple version of the app for free. After paying for the app, the user unlocks a version without ads or with additional functions. But freemium is much more pervasive than just mobile games. Consider Spotify, that allows free (non-premium) users to play music as long as they keep listening to advertisements.</p><p><img src="https://jochemgerritsen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Why-Go-Premium-Spotify-1-300x128.png" alt="Offering Your Product for Free at Spotify" width="903" height="385" srcset="https://jochemgerritsen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Why-Go-Premium-Spotify-1-300x128.png 300w, https://jochemgerritsen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Why-Go-Premium-Spotify-1.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 903px) 100vw, 903px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20903%20385'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://jochemgerritsen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Why-Go-Premium-Spotify-1-300x128.png 300w, https://jochemgerritsen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Why-Go-Premium-Spotify-1.png 700w" data-lazy-src="https://jochemgerritsen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Why-Go-Premium-Spotify-1-300x128.png"></p><p><em>Reasons to go Premium at Spotify</em></p><p>The idea of Freemium then, is to get free users of your product. <strong>Over time, the goal is to convert a percentage of those users into paying users <em>of the same product</em></strong>. Freemium works because because you lower the barrier for first-time users. In terms of payment, there is no such barrier. Because you remove this barrier, you gain a large potential customer base. You are direct into contact with this customer base, and you could convert these into paying users down the line.</p><p>Supposing you have some basic marketing set up and you get a new influx of free users every day. In this case, your focus can shift from marketing your product to people unknown with it, to marketing your product to free users and trying to convert these.</p><p>Interestingly, <strong>the benefit of freemium doesn’t only come from converting free users</strong>. Although that may be your main source of revenue, free users can also refer others. According to <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/05/making-freemium-work">Harvard Business Review</a>, a free user generally is worth 15-25% of a premium subscriber. A part of that worth comes from <em>referring other people</em> to the product. In this sense, even catering to free users will be beneficial for your bottom line in the long-run.</p><h3>2. Trial Users — Offering Your Product For Free Temporarily</h3><p>Freemium can also mean temporarily free. Many software products provide a free version of their product for a specific amount of time. After this time runs out, you have to pay. Netflix is a good example, which used to offer a month-long free trial.</p><p><strong>It’s like giving out a sample of your product</strong>. Users can ‘taste’ it, and then decide to buy or stop using the service altogether. Compared to freemium, putting a time restriction on free use has several benefits.</p><p>First, you don’t have to maintain two separate versions of the product. You simply do your best to offer the best product as possible; you do not need a toned-down version of the main product — or one in which ads are served.</p><p>Second, because you only have one product, trial users know exactly what to expect. <strong>They will not be as demanding as freemium users</strong>. Freemium users may feel entitled to certain new functionalities or support when something goes wrong. This is the reason that companies like MailChimp have a strict ‘no support’ policy for users who do not pay for their service.</p><p>In contrast, trial users will get all functionalities of a product, and know that they get this for a limited time. In that sense, they know what to expect and feel less entitled. As such, they require less service and support than freemium users.</p><h3>3. Engaging in Side-Project Marketing</h3><p>A third reason to go the free route is comes down to so-called ‘side-project marketing’. The central idea of side-project marketing is that <strong>you offer product A for free, in order to get paying users for product B</strong>.</p><p>One great example of side-project marketing is <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unplash</a>. Originally, Unsplash was a website for free stock photos created by the founders of graphic design marketplace Crew.</p><p>The founders of Crew simply wanted more ways to attract attention to their product, and in order to do that, they built an entirely new product. The starting premise of Unsplash was simple: offer 10 new license-free stock photos every 10 days.</p><p>I like to use this example, because Unsplash has been very successful. After gaining some early traction, Unsplash grew incredibly fast, and Crew was acquired by Dribbble.&nbsp;Interestingly though, that means that it <em>isn’t </em>a great example for side-project marketing. Why? Because rather than fulfilling its purpose of marketing the founders’ main product Crew, it became a stand-alone product.</p><p>Perhaps a better example then, and on a much smaller scale, is what we do at Enter Network with our weekly <a href="https://enter.network/entrepreneur-sessions/">Entrepreneur Sessions</a>. Every week, we bring a variety of entrepreneurs together in a short check-in. We discuss what everyone is working on, and talk about potential problems or challenges people are facing. While it is great to bring entrepreneurs together in this way, it also <strong>proves to be a great marketing channel</strong> for our other products. We’ve gained several paying customers for our monthly support group and meetups by offering this service for free.</p><h3>4. Getting More Customer Feedback</h3><p>Another reason to go free is simply to get more customer feedback. Although the startup mantra is to ‘monetize early’, sometimes monetization is not an option.</p><p>Particularly if you have an unfinished product or MVP (<a href="https://www.startupschool.org/videos/65" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">minimum-viable product</a>), you may want to offer it for free to get more customer feedback. In this situation, <strong>it is important that you make it as easy as possible for customers to offer that feedback</strong>. And ideally, there is a way for the product managers to directly contact the users and ask follow-up questions.</p><h3>5. Acquiring Customer Data (or: The Consumer as the Product)</h3><blockquote><p>If you’re not paying for the product, you <em>are</em> the product</p></blockquote><p>This famous quote encompasses quite well the reason&nbsp;<em>why</em> we (as users) often get products for free without feeling any pressure to pay in the long run. Consider for instance our email inboxes (Gmail) or social media (Facebook). <strong>The reason why companies offer such products for free is to ‘make the consumer the product’</strong>.</p><p>This can work in different ways, but usually this means that the customer’s data is somehow monetized. A classic example is Facebook. On Facebook, users share a lot of information about themselves. Facebook uses this information to allow third-party advertisers to run laser-focused ads.</p><p><img src="https://jochemgerritsen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ads-Million-Dollar-Homepage-300x169.png" alt="Ads on the Million Dollar Homepage" width="701" height="395" srcset="https://jochemgerritsen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ads-Million-Dollar-Homepage-300x169.png 300w, https://jochemgerritsen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ads-Million-Dollar-Homepage.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 701px) 100vw, 701px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20701%20395'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://jochemgerritsen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ads-Million-Dollar-Homepage-300x169.png 300w, https://jochemgerritsen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ads-Million-Dollar-Homepage.png 700w" data-lazy-src="https://jochemgerritsen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ads-Million-Dollar-Homepage-300x169.png"></p><p><em>Ads on the Million Dollar Homepage</em></p><p>Although Facebook does not have a great track record concerning privacy, seeing the consumer as the product is not inherently bad. Even in such cases, <strong>you do actually provide value to users</strong>. Personally, despite its faults, I’m happy that Facebook exists. <em><span>(note that I could care less about the million-dollar homepage, but that still made a million dollars!)</span></em></p><p>And if privacy is an issue, anonymization may be the solution. In some cases, a business can anonymize user data without losing its value to third-parties.</p><h3>6. Offering a Free Service to Increase Customer Loyalty</h3><p>Offering something for free can also <strong>improve (or keep) existing customer loyalty</strong>. Suppose you have developed a new functionality for your software or an entirely new product, which you intend to sell to new customers.</p><p>It may be a good idea to offer this new thing for free to current customers, and in this way provide a ‘thank you’ for their continued support. In return, you can expect users to be loyal to you and your product.</p><p>One example of this is ‘grandfathering’. In this strategy, current customers can keep paying the current price for an improved product, and new customers pay the new price. In a sense, <strong>current customers simply get more functionalities for free</strong>. Grandfathering is often done in Software as a Service (SaaS). The reason is that with SaaS, you continuously get new customers while you still want to keep your old customers happy.</p><h3>7. A Free Product Boosts Branding</h3><p>Lastly, offering a product for free may simply be part of a wider marketing and branding strategy. As opposed to a side-marketing project, the free product serves to make users known with the entire brand and a range of products, rather than one particular product.</p><p><strong>Look at larger companies like Google or Microsoft who offer a wide variety of free services</strong>. Consider Google Maps, Google Analytics, Google Mail, or alternatively Outlook, Skype, Office, etc. These companies use such products not only to get more paid users, but also as part of their wider marketing strategy.</p><p>The more often users will engage with a product by your brand, the more likely your …</p></div></div>

No need to be familiar with the game or the app, but feel free to check Rakaly out if you want, we’re just getting started.</p><p>I’m writing this post as whenever Rust is posted on the internet, it tends to elicit polar opposite responses: the evangelists and the disillusioned. Both can be correct in their viewpoints, but when one is neck deep in a Rust side project and stumbles across a discussion that is particularly critical of Rust, self doubt may creep into thoughts. And while self doubt isn’t inherently bad (second guessing can be beneficial), too much doubt can cause one to disengage with their hobby. This post is me sharing struggles seen along the way and realizing that the wins Rust gave me far outweigh the struggles.</p><p><img src="https://nbsoftsolutions.com/assets/da8f75-ba25297cbb5546f2f80247b6f810e71e9cf6b38bf89f4e135700b3360a3d9ad0.png"> <em>One of the visualizations created by Rakaly based on game data</em></p><p>It may seem surprising that someone who has been programming Rust as a hobby for 4 years would feel the need to have vindication now, but this project was my first user facing app with over 15k lines of Rust, and while I’ve programming Rust for a “long” time, I would only consider myself proficient and not an expert by any means.</p><p>Also for those who need to hear it: any side project that you’re proud of is a success.</p><p>As one might imagine from the title of this post, Rakaly is mainly written in Rust. This single Rust code base serves several use cases:</p><ul><li>The server side app which receives an EU4 game save file, runs diagnostics, and stores the save.</li><li>The wasm bundle which runs the same diagnostics client side</li><li>A shared library that I can give to third party developers so they can integrate the functionality.</li></ul><p>In total: a backend server, client side wasm, and a shared library all are derived from the same code base. I can’t imagine doing this in any other language.</p><h2 id="why-the-focus-on-client-side">Why the focus on client side</h2><p>Before diving into Rust specifics, I want to take a moment to share my philosophy that it’s important to offer a service that requires a minimal amount of friction for visitors and myself. A solution that can run self contained on the client is perfect. This is where Rust compiled to WASM (accessed through web workers) is critical.</p><p>Visitors can jump right in with just their browser without needing an account. No need to download a potentially sketchy executable or give credentials. They just drag and drop a file and all the processing is done inside the browser. Spotty internet, bandwidth limitations, or a slow or down server doesn’t inhibit the visitor’s experience.</p><p>For me a client side solution means that the server isn’t critical. A spike in visitors doesn’t necessarily mean a load spike on the server. If no cross user state needs persistence, one may not even need a backend. That’s the route I took with the <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/">Rocket League</a> replay <a href="https://github.com/nickbabcock/boxcars">parser I wrote</a> (can be seen <a href="https://rl.nickb.dev/">hosted here</a> and there’s even a community <a href="https://github.com/SaltieRL/BoxcarWrapper">written Python wrapper</a> – I seem to like to program game tools more than play them). With a leaderboard though, backend state is necessary for Rakaly. Though I take comfort in knowing that if I ever want to sunset the app whether for cost or time savings, the users will still be able to use the app, as all the static assets are stored in Cloudflare (and the use of <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/backblaze-b2-and-the-s3-compatible-api-on-cloudflare/">Cloudflare workers and B2</a> will allow even uploaded game save files to remain useable).</p><p>For those curious about the architecture:</p><ul><li>Cloudflare Workers (static assets + fetch S3 files)</li><li>Backblaze B2 (S3 compatible storage)</li><li>DigitalOcean (VPS)</li><li>Postgres (relational data)</li><li>Redis (leaderboard, session storage)</li></ul><p><img src="https://nbsoftsolutions.com/assets/eea606-f991077466167ea1fd724d3bc00fc53673c1444bb0bb4ae9b0fcf9a1d78e14fb.png"></p><p><em>Cloudflare ❤️ Backblaze ❤️ DigitalOcean ❤️ Postgres ❤️ Redis</em></p><p>Enough architecture, more Rust.</p><h2 id="wins">Wins</h2><p><strong>Sharing</strong>. The headlining win is the shared core. Simplifying things a bit, there are essentially 4 crates in this project:</p><ul><li>The parser which sets the foundation for all the other crates</li><li>The server app written with <a href="https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp">warp</a></li><li>A C compatible dynamic library with a nice header file created through <a href="https://github.com/eqrion/cbindgen/blob/9d7516ef1a4f1e202be5af78fc52cad22c0f3e68/docs.md">cbindgen</a>. Other parties have asked for Rakaly functionality (specifically in a C++ wx app) and this fits the bill perfectly.</li><li>The wasm interface that is translated by <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/">wasm-bindgen</a></li><li>Then there is the react frontend that communicates with the wasm through a web worker (can’t block the UI thread!)</li><li>Additional use cases can be added with ease. I’m thinking about one day adding a native app (different use case than web) and there’ll be an incredible amount of code reuse.</li></ul><p>All this sharing allows one person development teams to be anywhere and everywhere at once. Nothing is off limits.</p><p><strong>Serde</strong>. I’m able to write regular structs that happen to hold deserialized data. It’s important to not have additional ceremony in parsing the many fields as there are over 5000 unique fields that occur in a save. Having to write any additional code to support a field would be overwhelming.</p><p>To give an example, below is the only struct needed to deserialize and work with the version that the game save file declares itself to be. Notice that it has the logic to deal with a misspelling in the data, but the code sees the correct spelling.</p><figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>#[derive(Debug,</span> <span>Clone,</span> <span>Deserialize,</span> <span>Serialize,</span> <span>PartialEq)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>SavegameVersion</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>first</span><span>:</span> <span>u16</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>second</span><span>:</span> <span>u16</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>third</span><span>:</span> <span>u16</span><span>,</span>
    <span>#[serde(rename(deserialize</span> <span>=</span> <span>"forth"</span><span>))]</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>fourth</span><span>:</span> <span>u16</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure><p>That’s it. That’s 5 fields covered, only 4,995 more to go.</p><p>Additional benefit of serde is that it is parser agnostic. Even though save files can come in two flavors: JSON-like and binary (keys are identified by a 16 bit lookup table), both formats will be deserialized into the same struct. I shudder at the thought of where I would be in this project if I needed to duplicate every field, one for plaintext and another for binary. Serde is a huge productivity gain.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>. Save files are zip files that when inflated can reach in excess of 100MB. Parsing these files quickly is of the utmost importance. The same parsing code is executed on the client and server side and so must be fast for both. With Rust, files are parsed and deserialized at over 500 MB/s on the server side and around 100 MB/s through client side wasm. Could other languages be as fast or faster? Sure, especially if they are written in the style of <a href="https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson">simdjson</a>, but out of the parsers I’ve seen or written myself in years past, none can hold a candle to the performance of Rust.</p><p><strong>Tools</strong>: The tools that Rust and the Rust community provides are invaluable:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs">Criterion</a>: allows me to benchmark with confidence, so I can quantify performance differences in the changes I’m making (I’ve <a href="https://nbsoftsolutions.com/blog/guidelines-on-benchmarking-and-rust">written about Rust benchmarking before</a>)</li><li><a href="https://github.com/rust-fuzz/cargo-fuzz">Cargo fuzz</a>: gives me the confidence that I can accept untrusted user input without nefarious side effects.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross">Cross</a>: cross compiling a musl build for either aarch64 or x86 allows me to copy the executable anywhere and it’ll just work or I can easily use it in the <a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless">distroless docker containers</a></li><li>Rustfmt: I don’t have to spend cycles thinking how something is formatted</li><li>Clippy: catches silly mistakes</li><li>And more: shoutout to <a href="https://github.com/gnzlbg/cargo-asm">cargo asm</a>, <a href="https://github.com/RazrFalcon/cargo-bloat">cargo bloat</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kbknapp/cargo-outdated">cargo outdated</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/sunng87/cargo-release">cargo release</a></li></ul><p>Below is a screenshot from a criterion run showing that the core parsing logic for the binary format is almost reaching 1000 MB/s.</p><p><img src="https://nbsoftsolutions.com/assets/d2383d-e7fe7832720bdd6dfdee9c401df7d633bc66cc2ed89bbb32e7db288051cc1114.png"></p><h2 id="struggles">Struggles</h2><p>With Rust wins comes Rust struggles. Some will be new struggles that may not have been discussed yet, while others are well known, but it’s important to list them all as they all have a share in casting doubt.</p><p><strong>Serde</strong>. Serde is both a win and struggle. The underlying format of the game save files is proprietary and undocumented – it’s JSON-like but definitely not JSON. Here’s a snippet.</p><figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"core"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"core1"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"nums"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>4</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>],</span><span>
    </span><span>"core"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"core2"</span><span>
</span><span>}</span></code></pre></figure><p>Notice the <code>core</code> field occurs multiple times and the occurrences don’t follow one another. The end result is that data should be deserialized into:</p><figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct</span> <span>MyDocument</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>core</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
  <span>nums</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>u8</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure><p>Since serde doesn’t support <a href="https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/issues/690">aggregating multiple occurrences of a field</a>, I needed to buffer the whole document in memory and provide a small translation layer where I’d gather similarly named fields in one place for serde. I wrote a small segment about this inside another post with the intimidating title: <a href="https://nbsoftsolutions.com/blog/parsing-performance-improvement-with-tapes-and-spacial-locality.html">Parsing Performance Improvement with Tapes and Spatial Locality</a>. While ideally I’d like to parse the document iteratively, it hasn’t been a blocker on either the client or server side (probably because people are already used to browsers being memory hogs).</p><p><strong>Compile times</strong>. Everyone already expected this, so I’ll keep it short. There’s about 15k lines of Rust total and building the server crate on my 8 core machine takes 9 minutes for a clean build and 6 minutes for incremental. It’s not great, but I haven’t found it intolerable yet. For coping mechanisms: write more code between rebuilds, move code into a lower level crate (compiling a lower level crate will shave compile times down to a hair under a minute, but there’s only so much that can be done when using crates like serde (serde seems full of pros and cons)), or try to be productive during compiles and watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O0Nt9qY_vo">(Rust) youtube videos</a>. On a lower specced machine, compile times do verge on intolerable – my mid-range laptop (about 7 years old) takes a bit over 25 minutes for a clean compile and will make the machine occasionally unresponsive. Been thinking about buying a new laptop.</p><p><strong>Test execution times</strong>. This may or may not come as a surprise but when working with files that can reach 100MB (and this 100MB can’t really be whittled down), tests can be slow. I previously lauded Rust for how performant the code can be, but in debug mode the opposite is true. I don’t think I’ve seen a language with such a performance gap between debug and production mode. I’ll leave a snippet of my <code>Cargo.toml</code> to explain things.</p><figure><pre><code data-lang="toml"><span># We override the test profile so that our tests run in a tolerable time as</span>
<span># some of the asset files are heavyweight and can take a significant …</span></code></pre></figure></div></div></div>

<p>It is a jigsaw puzzle solver using AI</p>


<p>Check out a web-application based on one of the solvers at <a href="https://unpuzzler.herokuapp.com/">https://unpuzzler.herokuapp.com</a></p>


<p>This project consists of two components :  <em>creation and solving of puzzles</em> and <em>checking adjacency of puzzle pieces</em>.</p>

<p>I construct a <em>puzzle generator</em>, which takes a given image and cuts it up into a rectangular grid of  uniform square puzzle pieces with each puzzle piece being of a specified dimension. It further randomly rotates each square piece by 0/90/180/270 degrees counterclockwise and shuffles up the pieces, thus creating a puzzle.</p>

<p>I construct several models (machine-learning based and non-machine learning based) which are trained to detect if two given puzzle pieces are adjacent or not. I create custom datasets for these models using a <em>puzzle-pieces-pair generator</em> which is similar to the <em>puzzle generator</em> mentioned above. The actual images to construct the custom datasets are taken from the <a href="http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia-data/CUB-200-2011">CUB-200 dataset</a>. From the start, I split the images in the CUB-200 dataset into training, validation and test portions. I construct custom validation and test datasets to validate and evaluate the checking-adjacency models.</p>

<p>I design a <em>search algorithm</em> which takes a puzzle board with the <em>top-left corner filled in</em>, searches for the <em>best</em> pieces to fit into the board till the board is filled completely. The task of determining which pieces fit <em>better</em> makes use of the <em>checking-adjacency models</em>. I create <em>solvers</em>, which integrate the models with the search algorithm. Finally, I evaluate and compare the performances of the solvers on a test-data set of puzzles which are constructed by the puzzle generator from the test-portion of the CUB-200 dataset split.</p>

<p>I also give a web-application built using <a href="https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio">Gradio</a> which simulates the puzzle-solving by the solver which is deployed on Heroku</p>


<p>The code for this project can be found at <a href="https://github.com/nivbhaskhar/UnPuzzled/">https://github.com/nivbhaskhar/UnPuzzled</a></p>



<p>Here’s an animation of the solver in action</p>

<p><img src="https://nivbhaskhar.github.io/assets/solver_animation.gif" alt="Animation"></p>



<p>I evaluated solvers based on three checking-adjacency models, namely <em>AdjacencyClassifier_NoML</em> (a hand-engineered model), <em>FromScratch</em> (a simple CNN) and <em>ResNetFT</em> (a fine-tuned ResNet 18 model).</p>

<p>There were 67 <em>six-by-six</em> puzzles, 11 <em>five-by-five</em> puzzles and 2 <em>four-by-four</em> puzzles in the evaluation set</p>

<div>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th>puzzle_sizes</th>
      <th>no_of_puzzles</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>36</td>
      <td>67</td>

    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>16</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p>Both the <em>AdjacencyClassifier_NoML</em> and the <em>ResNetFT</em> solved 87.5 % of the puzzles completely correctly. <em>FromScratch</em> underperformed by solving only 37.5 % of the puzzles completely correctly.</p>

<div>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th>AdjacencyClassifier_NoML</th>
      <th>FromScratch</th>
      <th>ResNetFT</th>

    <tr>
      <th>avg_time_taken (sec)</th>
      <td>11.2126</td>

      <td>23.0482</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>percentage_solved</th>
      <td>0.875</td>
      <td>0.375</td>
      <td>0.875</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>avg_puzzle_sizes</th>
      <td>33.9875</td>
      <td>33.9875</td>
      <td>33.9875</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



<p><img src="https://nivbhaskhar.github.io/assets/SolverComparisons_61_0.png" alt="Venn diagram"></p>



<p>I further visually investigated what the models did on puzzles they did not solve completely correctly. It turned out that the solvers were putting together several chunks of the puzzles correctly even if they were not placing the pieces in the correct positions in the puzzle board. Further, the solvers sometimes put back mostly correct but rotated versions of the images. The current evaluation classified all these puzzles as <em>unsolved</em>.</p>

<p>If there are several similar pieces, and a solver chose and fit an incorrect piece, the puzzle of course will not be completely correctly solved. However the solver might (and did often) recover and get local chunks of the puzzle right. Perhaps a non-binary evaluation metric would aid in gauging the efficacy of these puzzle-solvers.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <div>

<p>Last week, my dad was asking me why I was proud of this triangle on my laptop.</p>
<p><img src="https://liamhinzman.com/img/vkTriangle.jpg"></p>
<p>I told him that rendering a triangle is complicated: it took me 3 days, and 1000+ lines of code to create the above image. This just made him more confused.</p>
<p>So I wrote this article explaining what the Vulkan graphics API is, how it works, and everything that goes into rendering a triangle with your GPU.</p>
<h2 id="what-vulkan-is">What Vulkan Is</h2>
<p>Vulkan is a graphics API that is designed to provide an accurate abstraction of how modern graphics processing units (GPUs) work. Unlike OpenGL, Vulkan is very verbose. Every detail related to the graphics API needs to be set up from scratch. The upsides to this are that you only use what you choose to, and you can better understand what’s going on in your application and in doing so achieve much higher performance.</p>
<p>This article is intended to be a concise overview of the fundamentals of Vulkan. It was written for somebody who knew Vulkan but has forgotten many of the details (i.e.&nbsp;future me). Most of the information here comes from the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2/html/vkspec.html">Vulkan 1.2 Spec</a>.</p>
<p>Note: This article uses the <a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Hpp/Vulkan">C++ bindings</a> for Vulkan</p>
<h2 id="vulkan-in-a-nutshell">Vulkan in a Nutshell</h2>
<p><em>From a bird’s eye view, here’s how a Vulkan application works:</em></p>
<p>Vulkan can access <strong>devices</strong>, which let you control one or more <strong>queues</strong>. Queues are how you send a list of commands to the GPU, and they can be members of one or more <strong>queue families</strong>, each of which can do different things (e.g.&nbsp;draw the vertices of a 3D model).</p>
<p><strong>Command buffers</strong> are how you submit commands to a queue. Device commands are ‘recorded’ to a command buffer through Vulkan API calls, and can then be submitted once or many times (e.g.&nbsp;once every frame) to a queue to be executed.</p>
<p>That’s the TL;DR - now it’s time to dive into the details!</p>
<h2 id="genesis">Genesis</h2>
<p><strong><em>Instances and Devices</em></strong></p>
<p><em>In the beginning there was the Vulkan API. And the API was made flesh through <code>vk::Instance</code>, and from it sprung all per-application state.</em></p>
<p>You initialize Vulkan by creating an instance, which contains application state - information like what version of the Vulkan API you’re using, your application’s name, and which extensions and layers you want to enable. Extensions and layers provide behavior that isn’t included by default in Vulkan, like extended error checking and call logging.</p>
<p>With an instance you can examine the <strong>physical devices</strong> (usually GPUs) that are available. A machine might have multiple physical devices, and each of their properties (such as being a dedicated graphics card) can be inspected.</p>
<p>A common pattern for physical device selection is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>List all of the physical devices</li>
<li>Score each physical device on desired properties</li>
<li>Give physical devices without required properties a score of 0</li>
<li>Pick the physical device with the highest score</li>
</ul>

<p>With a physical device you can create a <strong>logical device</strong>.</p>
<p>Physical devices represent the GPU, and logical devices are what you use to create resources and access <strong>queues</strong>.</p>
<p>Keeping the logical device separate from the physical device is also useful because it allows you to have multiple logical devices, each with their state and resources, for a single physical device. One example of where this would be useful is if you had a Vulkan rendering application that also used a UI Toolkit (also running on Vulkan) that was completely separate. They’d each need their own logical devices to operate, but they’re both using the same physical device.</p>
<p>Logical device creation is also where you create queues.</p>
<h2 id="making-stuff-happen">Making Stuff Happen</h2>
<p><strong><em>Queues, Command Buffers, and Render Passes</em></strong></p>
<p>A queue is a list of commands that the GPU executes.</p>
<p>Each queue can only have certain types of commands (some can have multiple types, others just one), and this is specified when a queue is created.</p>
<p>The four types of queue operations are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Graphics</strong> —&gt; Drawing the vertices of a model</li>
<li><strong>Compute</strong> —&gt; Ray tracing, cloth simulation</li>
<li><strong>Transfer</strong> —&gt; Loading textures and buffers</li>
<li><strong>Sparse</strong> —&gt; Loading part of a ‘mega-texture’</li>
</ul>
<p>A physical device will give you access to several queues of different <strong>queue families</strong>, and when you create a queue it will be an index to a queue of a matching queue family on the device. Queue families are queues that have the same properties as one another (e.g.&nbsp;perform both graphics and compute operations).</p>
<p>Commands are submitted to queues by first recording a series of commands into a command buffer and then submitting the entire command buffer to a queue with <code>vk::Queue::submit()</code>.</p>
<p>Note: Ideally you should reuse command buffers, but generally you can re-record them every frame without a large performance hit, and it makes some things easier (e.g.&nbsp;sending uniform buffers to shaders).</p>
<p>Also, you can submit multiple command buffers to a single queue. One reason why this is useful is that it <em>can</em> allow you to ensure that one set of commands from a command buffer completes execution before another command buffer in the queue starts (more on this later).</p>
<p>Finally, commands recorded in command buffers can perform:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Actions</strong> —&gt; draw, dispatch, clear, copy, query operations etc</li>
<li><strong>State setting</strong> —&gt; bind pipelines / buffers, push constants etc</li>
<li><strong>Synchronization</strong> —&gt; set / wait events, pipeline barriers etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Some commands perform just one of these tasks, while others do several. A <strong>render pass</strong> is needed to execute certain commands, including drawing.</p>
<h3 id="render-passes">Render Passes</h3>
<p>A render pass consists of one or more <strong>subpasses</strong>, along with several <strong>framebuffers</strong>. Framebuffers represent a series of memory attachments (e.g.&nbsp;color, depth etc) that each subpass can read from and write to.</p>
<p>A command in a subpass might write to a color buffer, which will allow for later subpasses / render passes to read from it. This allows for techniques like deferred rendering.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://learnopengl.com/img/advanced-lighting/deferred_g_buffer.png" alt=""><figcaption>Color attachments after initial render pass in deferred rendering (LearnOpenGL)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Deferred rendering is a story for another day, but the gist of it is that you can store most of the geometry information in an initial render pass, and <em>defer</em> expensive rendering operations like lighting for later.</p>

</details>
<p>Last thing! Some commands that perform actions (e.g.&nbsp;draw vertices) do so based on the current state (e.g.&nbsp;the currently bound array of vertices) set by commands since the start of the command buffer. This means that in the above code example, <code>cmd.draw()</code> will operate on the current state set by <code>cmd.bindVertex()</code> in the previous line. This “synchronization guarantee”, that one command will finish executing before the next one starts, is usually not true.</p>
<h2 id="synchronization">Synchronization</h2>
<p>GPUs are optimized for operation throughput, and because of this (with a few exceptions) <strong><em>commands are not executed in the order they were recorded in.</em></strong> The first command that performs an action in a command buffer isn’t guaranteed to finish executing before the last action command in that buffer. The first command buffer submitted to a queue won’t necessarily finish any commands before a later command buffer starts. The same thing applies to command buffers submitted on different queues and multiple subpasses.</p>
<p>At places the Vulkan spec is confusing on this topic, but the TL;DR is that this is true unless a <strong>synchronization object</strong> is used (or with state setting commands within a single command buffer).</p>
<p>There are a few different types of synchronization objects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Fences</strong> (GPU to CPU sync) —&gt; EX: ensure there are only two rendered frames at a time in the swap chain (i.e.&nbsp;double buffering)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Semaphores</strong> (GPU to GPU sync across queues) —&gt; EX: wait for frame to finish rendering before presenting it</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Barriers</strong> (Synch within a command buffer / pipeline) –&gt; EX: start compute shader execution as soon as the vertex shader is finished</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Subpass Dependencies</strong> (Synch between subpasses) –&gt; EX: wait for the normal and albedo attachments to complete before starting the lighting rendering subpass.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Synchronization is closely tied to the <strong>graphics pipeline.</strong></p>

        <p>Handling date and time is a challenge in any language, but Lau Taarnskov is determined to solve that problem in Elixir. Lau is today’s guest on Elixir Wizards, and this episode is all about his contributions to Elixir. Lau has been involved with web development and e-commerce for decades. He started contributing to Elixir open source in 2014 and created the Calendar and tzdata libraries. Calendar is a datetime library for Elixir, that provides explicit types for datetimes, dates, and times, and full time zone support is provided via its sister package, tzdata. When it comes to the subject of date, time, and time zones, besides talking about it and writing software for it, Lau also writes about it on his blog, Creative Deletion. </p>

<p>This episode explores how Lau got started in programming, and what led him to creating Calendar and tzdata. Lau shares the resources that he found helpful when he started using Elixir, and why he was drawn to Elixir in the first place. We hear Lau’s opinions on time zones and daylight savings and whether or not they’re necessary, and he shares some advice for anyone working with time in Elixir. </p>

<p>Then it’s time for another edition of Pattern Matching with Todd, in which Todd Resudek asks Brooklyn Zekanka five questions to help us get to know her better. Brooklyn talks about everything from she has lived, what jobs she did before becoming a programmer, and her education in classical music, to her favorite bands, movies, and TV shows, as well as some of the projects she is working on. For all this, and more, don’t miss today’s episode! </p>

  <p>The United States Navy’s next-generation aircraft carriers are rolling off the assembly line, with one massive flagship finally ready to begin operations, one fitting out, and three more on the way.</p>

<p>Though plagued with unforeseen issues in some of their innovative components, these floating fortresses are planned to operate for many decades, offering a tantalizing look at the future of naval technology.</p>

<h2 id="vr-assisted-design">VR-assisted design</h2>

<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LxE3ggb.jpg" alt="Three dimensional immersive visualization techniques used to design the Ford-class carriers" title="Three dimensional immersive visualization techniques used to design the Ford-class carriers" width="1092px" height="725px"><figcaption>Three dimensional immersive visualization techniques used to design the Ford-class carriers via <a href="https://www.navy.mil/ah_online/USSFord/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">navy.mil</a></figcaption></figure>

<p>The USS Gerald R. Ford is the first aircraft carrier to be designed <a href="https://www.thefordclass.com/cvn78/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">entirely in 3D</a>. Countless parts, from equipment and machinery to wiring and piping, were represented in a single highly detailed model down to the inch, reducing the likelihood of fitting problems arising in the construction phase.</p>

<p>Design was supplemented with the use of a VR system called CAVE - a room with high-resolution images projected on the walls, ceiling and floor, coupled with motion capture and glasses, allowing designers to physically move through a full-scale model of the aircraft carrier.</p>

<h2 id="more-nuclear-power">25% more nuclear power</h2>

<p>The new carrier class has a new heart beating inside it - the A1B nuclear reactor. (A means Aircraft carrier, 1 means it’s the contractor’s 1st generation design, and B stands for Bechtel Corporation, who built it.) Compared to the preceding Nimitz class’ A4W reactors, the Ford-class will generate <a href="https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/non-power-nuclear-applications/transport/nuclear-powered-ships.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">25% more energy</a>, all while being smaller and lighter. The technology is more refined, requiring fewer crew to operate and maintain.</p>

<p>The new reactors are so powerful that only <a href="https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monographs/2006/RAND_MG289.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">half the energy</a> produced is needed by current systems, with the rest set aside for the possible future inclusion of advanced technology, like laser weaponry and electric reactive armour - more on those below.</p>

<h2 id="electromagnetic-aircraft-launch-system">Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System</h2>

<p>Without a full runway, aircraft carriers need a method of drastic acceleration to get them to flying speed in a short distance. The EMALS technology works by activating and deactivating electromagnets along a pair of beams, generating <a href="https://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/how-things-work-electromagnetic-catapults-14474260/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a magnetic wave</a> which propels a carriage, which in turn accelerates the aircraft to flying speeds - up to 150mph (240 kph).</p>

<p>Traditional aircraft launching catapults use a steam-driven piston to pull the aircraft at high speed. Steam launching systems, introduced in the mid-1950s, are very large, and take a lot of manpower to operate.</p>

<p>Electromagnetic systems are safer, owing to their lack of reliance on pressurised steam, and as a solid state system, are expected to require much less effort to maintain. They also remove the need to pipe steam all over the ship.</p>

<p>They’re also expected to require less energy to operate than a steam system, with a <a href="http://www.edn.com/Pdf/ViewPdf?contentItemId=4341471" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">90% power conversion efficiency</a>, versus 5% for steam.</p>

<p>Because EMALs can finely control the launch sequence as it occurs, and because it places less stress on the airframe, it is <a href="https://www.ga.com/alre" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">able to adapt</a> to modern and future aircraft, allowing it to launch anything from heavy fighter aircraft to unmanned drones.</p>

<figcaption>USS Gerald R. Ford’s First Fixed-Wing Aircraft Launch</figcaption></figure>

<h2 id="advanced-arresting-gear-landing-system">Advanced Arresting Gear Landing System</h2>

<p>Old carriers use hydraulics to capture and decelerate their aircraft, and while functional, they cause huge amounts of stress on the airframe. UAVs can’t be captured this way, as they are unable to handle the stress of a hydraulic system.</p>

<p>The Ford-class uses a software controlled, modular system called AAG to solve these problems - a complex bit of machinery including a “water twister” - paddles in a tank of water to provide resistance and absorb the kinetic energy from the decelerating aircraft. <a href="https://www.navair.navy.mil/lakehurst/product/Advanced-Arresting-Gear-AAG" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AAG is more reliable</a>, places less stress on aircraft, and reduces operating costs.</p>

<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NwH27W9.jpg" alt="Diagram of the design of the Advanced Arresting Gear system" title="Diagram of the design of the Advanced Arresting Gear system" width="1280px" height="800px"><figcaption>Diagram of the design of the Advanced Arresting Gear system, via <a href="https://www.navair.navy.mil/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">www.navair.navy.mil</a></figcaption></figure>

<h2 id="efficiency">Efficiency</h2>

<p>The simplification of components and the refinements in design mean that the Ford-class carriers are expected to require approximately 25%, or some 500-800, fewer sailors to operate, leading to significant cost reductions in the long term. More recently, the navy has mentioned a less optimistic <a href="https://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=111313" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">20% reduction in crew</a>, leading some to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/craighooper/2019/11/06/the-uss-fords-business-case-sinks-as-the-troubled-ship-finishes-sea-trials/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">question</a> whether the Navy’s projections for efficiency gains were overly rosy, although a significant reduction is still expected.</p>

<h2 id="future-tech-giant-lasers-and-electric-shields">Future tech: Giant lasers and electric shields</h2>

<p>Under active development and even <a href="https://www.cpf.navy.mil/news.aspx/130628" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">onboard testing</a>, high-energy solid-state lasers are expected to be deployed to the fleet. Unlike many other shipboard weapons, laser weapon technology can target ships and aircraft alike, with a goal of also being able to target incoming missiles.</p>

<p>The navy <a href="https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/n/navy-shipboard-lasers.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">lists</a> modification of the Ford-class aircraft carriers as an option in coming years, so “that they can support SSLs with power levels of 200 kW or 300 kW or more, and/or megawatt-class FELs.” SSLs being solid-state lasers, and FELs, free-electron lasers.</p>

<p>The Navy recently <a href="https://www.cpf.navy.mil/news.aspx/130628" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">demonstrated</a> the technology on the USS Portland, giving us a spectacular look at the future of shipboard weaponry.</p>

<figure><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bWFGzoYod5M" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<figcaption>The USS Portland shooting down a drone with a Solid State Laser</figcaption></figure>

<p>Another exciting technology, under quiet development for use in tanks, is electric reactive armor, mentioned as a possible upgrade to ships like the Ford-class. While not much information is available to the public about the technology, the idea involves two plates separated by some insulating material, charged with huge amounts of electricity.</p>

<p>An incoming projectile impacting the armor would close the circuit between the two plates, channeling huge currents through it, potentially vaporising it or otherwise hindering the ability of the projectile to damage the carrier.</p>

<h2 id="the-trouble-with-innovation">The trouble with innovation</h2>

<p>Innovation comes at a cost, and the Ford-class carriers have been no exception. Each ship in the class, of which 2 are built, 1 is under construction, and a further 2 are ordered, come in at around a hefty $12 billion apiece, compared to the preceding Nimitz class’ roughly $8.5 billion price tag.</p>

<p>There’s been no shortage of controversy in the development of the project, mostly around the aircraft launch system, and the arresting gear. EMALs started its life <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/RS20643.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">missing reliability goals</a>, and ended up being delayed for years and costing billions more than expected in additional software and hardware development. And the Advanced Arresting Gear system encountered unforeseen problems with its water twister, leading to delays and increased costs.</p>

<p>The teething issues proved surmountable, however. By 2017, the USS Gerald R. Ford successfully tested the electromagnetic launch and landing systems. As of June 2020, over <a href="https://www.ga.com/general-atomics-emals-aag-systems-achieves-3000-aircraft-launch-and-recovery-milestone-aboard-uss-gerald-r-ford" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">3000 launches</a> and landings have been performed aboard the USS Gerald R. Ford, with 167 successfully performed in a single day.</p>

<p>The Ford is still gearing up, with around 1,000 sailors joining the crew in recent months to see it through final testing and trials.</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Service meshes have attracted an enormous amount of hype around them. With at least a few talks about service meshes during each tech conference, one can easily be convinced that having a service mesh in their infrastructure is a must. However, hype isn’t a good indicator of whether the new shiny tech is the right solution for your problems. So below, I’ll try to express an anti-hype opinion on service meshes to hopefully make it less confusing when you want to decide whether you may or may not need one.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://serce.me/img/servicemesh/rick.png" alt="rick"></span></p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s a lesson here, and I’m not going to be the one to figure it out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
— Rick Sanchez
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_the_invention">The invention</h3>
<p>Let’s take a step back in history and take a look at one of the <a href="https://eng.lyft.com/envoy-7-months-later-41986c2fd443">early articles</a> about introducing Envoy at Lyft.</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>As it turns out, almost every company with a moderately-sized service oriented architecture is having the same problems that Lyft did prior to the development and deployment of Envoy:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An architecture composed of a variety of languages, each containing a half-baked RPC library, including partial (or zero) implementations of rate limiting, circuit breaking, timeouts, retries, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Differing or partial implementations of stats, logging, and ….</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>While Envoy is not a service mesh by itself, the outlined problems describe the exact reason why service meshes were invented. They add “rate limiting, circuit breaking, …” and other reliability, observability, and security features to the services by enforcing the communication to go through the service mesh proxies, a data plane. Additionally, they require a separate component, a control plane, to control the configuration.</p>
<p>However, at this point, a lot of people miss the context in which service meshes were introduced. Service meshes are able to solve the problem not because it’s impossible to solve them in any other way. There are many battle-proof RPC libraries that take on the challenges of a separate data plane layer, <a href="https://github.com/twitter/finagle">Finagle</a>, <a href="https://github.com/grpc">gRPC</a>, <a href="https://github.com/line/armeria">Armeria</a>, <a href="https://github.com/apple/servicetalk">Servicetalk</a>, to name a few. After all, the very first service mesh - Linkerd 1.0 <a href="https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd">is powered by Finagle</a>. The RPC libraries will need a component which provides service discovery and configuration management to make it a true mesh. For instance, Zookeeper, or Consul, a component that service meshes call a control plane.</p>
<p>Why introduce a new concept to solve the problems that have been solved before? The service mesh concept wasn’t introduced to address problems that hadn’t been addressed before but rather address them in a way that doesn’t require any modifications to the application code, which is incredibly convenient when it’s hard to introduce an RPC layer into an existing heterogeneous microservice environment.</p>
<p>When you hear service mesh, Istio with Envoy might be the first thing that comes to mind, but it wasn’t the first service mesh to enter the market. Linkerd authors who pioneered the space, described exactly this situation in the <a href="https://linkerd.io/2017/04/25/whats-a-service-mesh-and-why-do-i-need-one/#why-is-the-service-mesh-necessary">"why is the service mesh necessary"</a>. Interestingly, in many hype-y articles on the Internet this context is often forgotten, or omitted.</p>
<p>Solving a problem well, even if it’s a problem that a lot of people have, doesn’t magically provide the tech with a lot of hype. There is always a sponsor behind it. I don’t know who the sponsor was here, and I’m going to speculate, but it’s hard to sell an RPC library in the world where open source is a fundamental requirement. There is no clear business model there, that’s why most of the mature RPC libraries were open-sourced by large tech companies for which it’s not a part of the core business model. A library is just code, not a piece of infrastructure. Service meshes are a different story. It’s an isolated non-trivial piece of infrastructure. As a vendor, not only can you provide consultancy around the configuration and deployment, but you can also sell complete hosted solutions around it.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_disillusionments">Disillusionments</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve established the problems, the solution, and most importantly, the context in which the solution was made, let’s take a look at the alternatives. The most obvious one, in the spirit of KISS, is to use an RPC library for your preferred language. Here is where the context is crucial: if you have a large fleet of services, each written in its own language/ecosystem, and the only language that they share is HTTP then having a single shared RPC library is going to be hard. Perhaps, you’ve got a fabric of deployed and running services, but everyone is afraid of touching them, no one knows how they work, and each redeploy is an adventure. A service mesh is here to help you, because at least you’ll be able to roll out new infrastructure features to the mesh regularly.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you have a fleet of healthy services written in a single application stack, then it’s a good idea to think twice before introducing a service mesh. By simply introducing or evolving a shared RPC library, you’ll get the exact same benefits and avoid dealing with the downsides of maintaining service meshes. By studying the service mesh limitations thoroughly, you can avoid finding yourself in the trough of disillusionment.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://serce.me/img/servicemesh/curve.png" alt="Hype Cycle"></span></p>
<div>
<h4 id="_different_ecosystem">Different ecosystem</h4>
<p>The ecosystem of the service mesh of your choice will likely be different from the ecosystem of your services. Beautiful websites always make you believe that the solution is plug’n’play, always works and never goes down. In reality, sooner or later problems, bugs, quirks in behaviour will reveal themselves, as they always do. At that point, you’ll need to have engineers who work on the service-mesh’s ecosystem which when it’s different from the main app, effectively limits the set of people who can introduce changes or fix problems. This is likely to reintroduce silos, which is against the whole DevOps spirit. Yes, having a DevOps team of engineers who are doing DevOps-y things <a href="https://continuousdelivery.com/2012/10/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-devops-team/">is against DevOps</a>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_unnecessary_overhead">Unnecessary overhead</h4>
<p>Not only having a proxy in front of each service adds overhead (often significant, talking about <a href="https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/deployment/performance-and-scalability/">90pt</a> rather than 99pt in the performance summary <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/latency-response-time/">doesn’t make software run faster</a>) and consumes resources, but you also requires time (or rather a team of people) to manage them. Yes, it can help to make some of the tasks potentially easier - yay, you can now add canary deployments with a few lines of YAML to simple applications now. However, you still need to manage canary deployments of the proxies themselves which don’t have a proxy in front of them. The problems just get pushed up the stack.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_limiting_your_architecture_to_what_the_proxy_supports">Limiting your architecture to what The Proxy supports.</h4>
<p>As you’re reading this paragraph, HTTP/3 is slowly being rolled out to the Internet. It uses UDP as transport. Why use UDP rather than create a completely new protocol you ask? That’s because anything but TCP and UDP is simply “blocked” by the boxes, various proxies on the internet - routers, gateways, etc. This phenomenon got named <a href="https://http3-explained.haxx.se/en/why-quic/why-ossification">ossification</a>. So, only TCP or UDP are left is the practical chose, and even UDP is partially blocked by various corporate proxies which slows down the adoption.</p>
<p>Even though your microservice environment is probably much smaller compared to the Internet, you can draw parallels with service meshes. Proxies can ossify your application architecture by limiting how your services talk to each other, and there is not much benefit in having proxies if you can bypass them. Suppose you want to build a reactive application which is using RSocket over pure tcp? Or perhaps a message-driven application using an actor model? Or maybe push the performance boundaries with Aeron? Not going to happen until the box in the middle becomes aware of the protocol.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_do_i_need_one">Do I need one?</h3>
<p>What does it all mean for you as an engineer? The answer to whether you need to adopt the service mesh approach comes down to the state of the microservice environment you’re trying to improve. As we have established, compared to an RPC framework, service meshes allow you to:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Deploy the infra changes more often than deploying your services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Introduce infra changes without touching the service code.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>The point 1. is important when for whatever reason you can’t redeploy your services very often, e.g. maybe no one remembers how it’s done anymore, or maybe there are other restrictions. The point 2. is important when your stack is heterogeneous, e.g. some services are built in Go, some in Java, some in Haskell, etc. Where are you on the interval from a huge set of heterogeneous services with unknown deployment schedules to a set of homogenous regularly deployed services defines whether a service mesh is the best solution for you.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Service meshes have a lot of hype around them, and way too much in my opinion. However, before committing to a piece of technology, it’s crucial to understand the problems it solves, and the context in which the solution was made. A service mesh is not an ultimate “good practice” but simply one of the patterns to solve a set of issues, and it’s quite a heavy one.</p>
<p>Rather than jumping on board, look carefully - the last thing you want is to find out that you have invested in a solution for a problem that you don’t have. Service meshes are an amazing piece of tech solving a whole lot of problems. Not in every case, it is the best solution.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>In the book Winning, the legendary General Electric CEO Jack Welch defines his rules of leadership:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule 3: Leaders get into everyone’s skin, exuding positive energy and optimism…your job as a leader is to fight the gravitational pull of negativism. That doesn’t mean you sugarcoat the challenges your team faces. It means you display an energizing, can-do attitude about overcoming them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I couldn’t agree more. How many truly optimistic managers do you see on a day to day basis?  Not people that are so over-leveraged that fear pushes them to hope everything works out. Not people who ignore hard truths and escape into a good Spotify playlist.</p>

<p>Optimistic managers. Managers who see the world for what it is - a never-ending grind full of challenges, bad-breaks, luck, let-downs, inspirations, and everything in between - and approach it with a consistently positive energy and will to make things work.</p>

<p>The answer: not enough. Here are some ways you can uplevel your optimism.</p>

<p>To be optimistic, don’t:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Commiserate regularly with your reports. Commiseration is a little forfeit, every time. As a leader, you shouldn’t be signalling that the way to react to adversity is to lament. The film Saving Private Ryan calls this out beautifully: “Gripes only go up the chain of command, never down. Privates gripe to sergeants, sergeants gripe to captains, captains gripe to majors, majors gripe to colonels and colonels gripe to generals. Gripes always go up, never down.”</li>
  <li>Otherize other teams in the org. Or more bluntly: don’t talk shit about other teams. They might not be perfect, but neither are you. Otherizing only makes it harder to find the path forward.</li>
  <li>Pretend like everything is great. Again, optimism isn’t about pretending things are great. It’s a commitment to framing things as challenges to be solved, not problems to be lamented.</li>
</ul>

<p>To be optimistic, do:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Have a never-ending well of persistence. You might feel like Sisyphus pushing that boulder up the hill day in and day out. Optimistic people understand that most of one’s work life is pushing boulders up hills and have a good attitude about it.</li>
  <li>Get over things. If you can’t reset your opinion on people, problems, slights, and all other things to an absolute neutral, you’ll be saddled with a distracting and deteriorating buildup of resentment. Learn to get over things completely.</li>
  <li>Commit. If you’re second guessing yourself every step of the way you’ll never be able to sustain optimism. Set some timeframe for re-evaluation - maybe 6 months or a year - and then forget about anything that sounds like “maybe”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Optimism isn’t a feeling that puffs your lungs up with rejuvenating life and leads to transcendent moments of inspiration. It’s removing the friction that your ego and backbone want to instinctively introduce when faced with challenges. It’s a way to move forward.</p>

<p>The plot goes like this.</p>
<h2>A little AirPods story</h2>
<p>You are stoked to have received your fresh AirPods in your mail.</p>
<p>You use them regularly and have a pretty good experience.</p>
<p>One day though, after months of usage, you get a rattling noise in one of your AirPods.</p>
<p>You don't understand where the issue lies, since you never dropped them and you know you handled them with cure (since it's a <em>premium product</em>, not so sure about that..)</p>
<p>You become a detective, and comb through all 1000+ issues related to "AirPods rattling".</p>
<p>"There is a fix!" - simply return the faulty AirPod to Apple and get a replacement.</p>
<p>You put out 99$ (more or less) and get them refunded when your faulty pair returns to their facility.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Not so fast</h2>
<p>Now you say, "well that went smooth, a bit annoying but I have my functioning AirPods again".</p>
<p>Time passes and your AirPods seem to work well. A month goes by and you almost forgot about that annoying rattling sound.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>The rattling noise comes back and hits you, in the ear. Sucker punch style.</p>
<p>It's on the other AirPod though.</p>
<p>You think about your past replacement experience and really don't want to go through this another time.</p>
<p>But what do you do? You don't have many alternatives.</p>
<p><strong>Except to learn from your mistakes</strong></p>
<h2>All's well that ends well</h2>
<p>Nah. It's not "well".</p>
<p>You put out 250$ to have a "temporarily working" product that you regularly need to replace (one airpod at a time).</p>
<p>That's not ok, sorry Apple.</p>
<h2>Timeline</h2>
<ul>
<li>Purchased on beginning of April (April 9th 2020)</li>
<li>First "rattling" experience in June (June 4th 2020)</li>
<li>Contact support and order replacement (June 8th 2020)</li>
<li>Receive replacement (June 12th 2020)</li>
<li>Confirmation from Apple to have received the faulty part + reimbursement (June 15th 2020)</li>
<li>Second "rattling" experience in July (July 20th 2020)</li>

          <p>
            2014-11-21
          </p>
          
          <p>At <a href="http://www.redjack.com/">RedJack</a>, all of our <a href="http://www.redjack.com/solutions/">core
products</a> depend on a network sensor that
collects various bits of information about the raw traffic that we see on the
network.  We’re doing some non-trivial analysis on fairly large network links
using commodity hardware, so we’ve implemented this sensor in C.  At its core is
an extremely fast custom <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming">flow-based
programming</a> framework.
It’s a damn cool piece of code, but this post isn’t about the code itself; it’s
about how we deliver that code to our customers.</p>

<p>Just because we’ve written this component in C, that doesn’t mean we want to
turn our back on the kinds of tooling you get to use when working in other, more
modern languages.  In particular, once you’ve gotten used to modern package
managers like <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/">npm</a>, <a href="http://leiningen.org/">leiningen</a>,
<a href="http://golang.org/doc/articles/go_command.html">go</a>, and
<a href="http://doc.crates.io/guide.html">Cargo</a>, it’s hard to go back to things like
<a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a> and <em>[shudder]</em> the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_build_system">autotools</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>And the worst part is that those examples aren’t even comparable.  Very little
code exists in isolation these days; in addition to the actual source code that
you’ve written (in whatever language you’ve chosen), you’re going to have
dependencies on other libraries.  All of the npm-like package managers are
full-featured systems that handle <strong>dependency management</strong> as well as the
actual <strong>building</strong> of your code.  CMake and the autotools, on the other hand,
only focus on the build step — they assume that all of your dependencies are
already available.</p>

<p>At this point, C (and C++) developers usually throw up their hands and give up.
You either try to avoid third-party dependencies at all, by embedding
everything you need so that you can fold the “dependency management” step into
your existing build tool.  Or you list your dependencies in a human-readable
<code>INSTALL</code> document in the source tree, and rely on the ingenuity and elbow
grease of your users to track down and install all of the prereqs by hand.  If
you’re lucky, and your project is popular enough to include in the major Linux
distros’ package repositories, then the various package maintainers will
re-encode all of this information in the distro-specific package definitions.
But because there’s no single, standardized packaging specification for Linux
(let alone for other POSIX-y operating systems), that means someone has to do
that separately for each distro that you need to support.</p>

<p>So we created <a href="https://github.com/dcreager/buzzy/">Buzzy</a>.  It gives us npm-style
dependency management for our C projects, and — almost as a side effect! — makes
it easy to generate native packages of our software for all of the Linux distros
that we need to support.  The end result is that it’s dirt simple to build and
install <a href="https://github.com/dcreager/varon-t/">one of our libraries</a>, along with
all of its prerequisites:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone git://github.com/dcreager/varon-t.git
$ cd varon-t
$ buzzy install -q
[1] Clone git://github.com/dcreager/libcork.git (master)
[2] Clone git://github.com/dcreager/clogger.git (master)
[3] Clone git://github.com/dcreager/buzzy-core.git (master)
[4] Install native Arch package pkg-config 0.28+rev.2
[5] Install native Arch package check 0.9.14
[6] Install native Arch package cmake 3.0.2
[7] Build libcork 0.14.1 (cmake)
[8] Stage libcork 0.14.1 (cmake)
[9] Package libcork 0.14.1 (pacman)
[10] Install libcork 0.14.1 (pacman)
[11] Build clogger 0.3.1 (cmake)
[12] Stage clogger 0.3.1 (cmake)
[13] Package clogger 0.3.1 (pacman)
[14] Install clogger 0.3.1 (pacman)
[15] Build varon-t 1.0.2 (cmake)
[16] Stage varon-t 1.0.2 (cmake)
[17] Package varon-t 1.0.2 (pacman)
[18] Install varon-t 1.0.2 (pacman)
</code></pre>

<p>That single <code>buzzy</code> command works unchanged on Arch Linux, RHEL 6 and 7, any
recent Debian or Ubuntu, and Mac OS X (via Homebrew).</p>



<p>Buzzy has some interesting characteristics that are definitely different than
other bits of C project tooling — we purposefully tried to take into account the
best practices that have emerged in other modern package managers.  Of course,
there are also some idiosyncrasies that come from dealing with C projects.</p>

<h5 id="declarative-package-descriptions">Declarative package descriptions</h5>

<p>With most existing C build tools, you provide a <strong>script</strong> that describes how to
build your project.  With Buzzy, you provide a <a href="https://github.com/dcreager/libcork/blob/develop/.buzzy/package.yaml">declarative
description</a>
of the package, and let Buzzy decide what to do with that description for your
particular platform.</p>

<h5 id="decentralized-package-descriptions">Decentralized package descriptions</h5>

<p>Buzzy does not have a single centralized database of package descriptions.
Instead, you put your package description into the source repository as the code
itself.  Part of your package description is a list of
<a href="https://github.com/dcreager/libcork/blob/develop/.buzzy/links.yaml">links</a> to
other Buzzy-enabled source repositories that you depend on.</p>

<h5 id="just-handle-dependencies-and-packaging">Just handle dependencies and packaging</h5>

<p>Buzzy is not a build tool; it delegates to something else to actually build the
source code for any particular project.  We happen to use CMake for all of our
libraries, and Buzzy also works fine with the autotools.</p>

<h5 id="use-the-native-ecosystem-wherever-possible">Use the native ecosystem wherever possible</h5>

<p>In part, this means that we produce native packages; we haven’t invented a new
packaging format or anything like that.  It also means that if a dependency is
available as a native package, we install that, instead of building our own.  We
only fall back on building our own copy for those cases (I’m looking at you,
RHEL!) where the native package is too old to satisfy a versioned dependency.</p>

<h5 id="auto-detect-as-much-as-possible">Auto-detect as much as possible</h5>

<p>Wherever we can, we try to figure something out for you instead of making you
state it explicitly.  If we see a <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file in your source
repository, we assume that your project is built using CMake.  Moreover, we know
how to build CMake projects without you having to provide an explicit set of
commands to run or options to pass in to those commands.</p>

<p>Buzzy also knows the most common patterns for how the different distros name
their native packages.  So if your package has a build dependency on <code>jansson</code>,
we know to look for a native package called <code>jansson</code> or <code>libjansson</code> on Arch,
<code>jansson-devel</code> or <code>libjansson-devel</code> on RPM derivatives, and <code>jansson-dev</code> or
<code>libjansson-dev</code> on Debian derivatives.</p>

<p>And of course, there’s a way to override this auto-detection if Buzzy doesn’t
know best for a particular situation.  (Because we live in a world where <code>zlib</code>
is called <code>zlib1g</code> on Debian systems.)</p>



<p>It’s important to note that Buzzy is not a panacea.  It doesn’t know, for
instance, that RPM and Debian derivatives want you to make separate runtime and
developer packages for your libraries.  Right now Buzzy just blindly builds a
single monolithic package regardless of what distro you’re on.  But, it’s served
us well so far, and it’s definitely a good start!</p>

<p><span>Unfortunately (or luckily?), I don’t have a circular saw at home. So, here is my take on how to do it just using a pencil, a ruler, and a knife.</span></p>


<h2><span id="Preparations">Preparations</span></h2>
<p><span>I’m going to use the box that came with the monitor as a cabinet, which means the final arcade machine will be a portable bar top version. No soldering required.</span></p>
<p><span>The software part will run on <a href="https://retropie.org.uk/">RetroPie</a>, an excellent image for Raspberry Pi micro computer. I will also explain how to add a nice cardboard-compatible theme, and fetch game video previews and info.</span></p>

<p>While RetroPie can <a href="https://retropie.org.uk/about/systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">emulate 50 different gaming platforms</a> (including PlayStation, PSP, Dreamcast, Nintendo, MSX, and others), I will focus on setting up controllers and games for an emulator called <a href="https://www.fbalpha.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Final Burn Alpha</a> (FBA) – basically a multiple retro arcade machine emulator. The FBA games typically use 2 to 4 controller buttons, sometimes 6 (works for us!). Otherwise, you can easily drop any other platform ROMs to the according folders, and they will just work (probably 😉 ).</p>

<p>The total budget in my case was about €270, but it could be about €140 if you find a used monitor with a box (I just bought a brand new one).</p>

<h3><span id="Step_5_Flashing_RetroPie">Step 5 – Flashing RetroPie</span></h3>



<p><a href="https://retropie.org.uk/download/">Download</a> the pre-built RetroPie image for the Raspberry Pi model you are using. You will also need a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-imager-imaging-utility/">Raspberry Pi Imager tool</a> to flash the image onto the SD card. Please note that not all card readers/writers are the same. Therefore, I advise reading tips and tricks on the Raspberry blog post if you run into issues writing the card.&nbsp; You need to burn a <strong>Custom</strong> <code>.img</code> from your computer:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lokalise.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/0-1024x662.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://lokalise.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/0-1024x662.jpg 1024w, https://lokalise.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/0-300x194.jpg 300w, https://lokalise.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/0-768x497.jpg 768w, https://lokalise.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/0.jpg 1280w, https://lokalise.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/0-300x194@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Insert the SD card into the slot on Raspberry Pi and power it up! It will reboot itself after the initial preparations.</p>



<p>You will need to connect a USB keyboard at this point to do some initial set up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once booted, you will see the following screen:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Say you're building a product, be it software or hardware (or <a href="https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/">innovative alien technology</a>), you may need a product roadmap. Why? It helps you set out the vision, strategy, and goals for what you're creating.</p><p>It doesn't matter if you're working on your startup as a solo founder or work in an enterprise as a product manager, business analyst, or project manager. Yes, the detail and format may change somewhat depending on where and how you work. I mean, it could be that you work in an Agile environment or are the decision-maker, or maybe you need stakeholder 'buy-in' from lots of people. No matter, a good product roadmap helps a ton.</p><p>In the list I made below, you can review if you took into account some crucial points.</p><p>So without further ado, I present to you the 'Epic Product Roadmap Checklist!'</p><h2>The Checklist</h2><ol role="list"><li>Do you really know what the audience of your product needs?</li><li>Make sure the strategy for your product is correct before spending time defining features and metrics.</li><li>Don't fear to say no (in a kind way) if stakeholders want to push in irrelevant features.</li><li>Don't try to put everything in the roadmap. Remember, you still have a product backlog for detailed user stories.</li><li>Did you get buy-in from everyone involved? Development team, marketing, sales, sponsors, etc.? Involve them in the creation. It is not a one-man-show.</li><li>Is the timeframe for the milestones realistic? Not too long, not too short.</li><li>Make sure it is clear what you prioritize on. Time, Budget, or Goal.</li><li>Are your users ready for the release schedules? Is the cadence steady and right for them?</li><li>Remember, goals &gt; features.</li><li>How does the product(roadmap) fit in with other products and their release schedules?</li><li>Do ask others for input. You did that, right.</li><li>Determine and update the metrics you track for measuring your goals.</li><li>Tell a story through the roadmap that is both convincing and achievable.</li><li>Is the roadmap laid out contextually? I.e., communicate every important decision that you made in creating the roadmap.</li><li>To get better buy-in, did you address doubts of influential stakeholders beforehand?</li><li>Did you gather all requirements?</li><li>Are all requirements cut up into manageable and logic parts?</li><li>Don't tell others HOW to do the work of what they need to do (in the roadmap). Only show WHY and WHAT.</li><li>Have you made a good business case for everything on the roadmap? Is the value clear? Is it measurable?</li><li>Don't go overboard with the details when the roadmap is for a (small) startup. On the other hand, a place to do this is in enterprise-grade businesses.</li><li>Don't hide unknown-unknowns. Keep researching until you at least have the potential scope failure of a (sub)product.</li><li>Take into account what your teammates can achieve. Don't provide unrealistic milestones.</li><li>Document the process of how you came to creating the roadmap.</li><li>ABU. Always Be Updating (your team members and stakeholders). Don't let people work with old info.</li><li>Don't surprise stakeholders during a presentation. They should have been up to speed before you present your roadmap.</li><li>Talk about details with (for example) the engineering team, so that you can better schedule feature releases.</li><li>Do you know what is essential for the stakeholders? I.e., what you need to prioritize?</li><li>Watch out for big clients swaying feature priorities!</li><li>Don't write too much. Only the minimum needed to transfer the message.</li><li>Don't try to predict the details of everything in the product roadmap. Only go into super detail for the first 10% - 20% of the roadmap.</li><li>Be honest. Don't say things that you're unsure of.</li><li>Use good tools for both creating and presenting your roadmap.</li><li>Do your best storytelling in all communication.</li><li>Add both short-term and long-term goals in the roadmap. It keeps a steady cadence of wins.</li><li>Technical (and security) debt is real. Do make time for it in the roadmap.</li><li>When presenting your roadmap, make clear what the intention and goal of the presentation are.</li><li>When creating your roadmap, take into account who is consuming the document(s).

        <div>
          <p><h4>Assignable</h4></p>
          <p>
            Connect your favorite MIDI controller to assign its knobs with
            SEQers'.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once assigned, all mappings are saved on disk - no need to
            re-assign after relaunch.
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't have a controller with 64 knobs? No worries. You can shift
            midi mappings vertically and horizontally to access all knobs
            even by 8 physical knobs.
          </p>

        </p>
        <div>
          <p><h4>Connectable</h4></p>
          <p>
            SEQer can talk with any internal/external software/hardware with
            virtual/actual MIDI ports.
          </p>
          <p>Each track has dedicated output.</p>
          <p>
            MIDI clock sync in/out is supported. SEQer can become the
            master/client of another device with MIDI clock capability.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        
        <div>
          <p><h4>Hot Repeat</h4></p>
          <p>
            Extend your pattern by repeating specific steps.
          </p>
          <p>
            Assign MIDI buttons/keys to gray dots above the knobs. 
            Then, pressing &amp; holding MIDI buttons will loop the dedicated steps.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every tracks has its own loop so complicated polyrhythm can be easily made with SEQer.

<p>It kills me not to own shares in Tesla. I have been and remain bullish on the company’s future success since 2014. It was the first stock I ever bought. Last year I once held more than half my net worth in Tesla at $212. But I strongly believe it will come down before it goes up.</p>



<p>Forget comparing it to other car companies (of which it is now the most valuable). With a market cap of $257B, Tesla is currently trading as one of the top 25 most valuable companies in the world. I believe it can and will deserve that valuation in time. I believe it can grow to be in the top 10 and even the top 5 eventually, but I do not see how anyone can argue that it is there yet.</p>



<p>Tesla today is worth more than either Amazon or Facebook was 5 years ago. One can argue about inflation or how those companies are nothing alike and it is a useless comparison if they like but I think it is helpful to context. Blind bulls may get angry and say whatever will make them feel better but they would fail to realize that I am actually on their side. I love Tesla and I am still rooting for the company and its ambitious leader as I have been all along. That does not stop me from being able to believe that it is heavily overvalued right now.</p>



<p>For what it is worth, I do not think Elon Musk was joking when he tweeted “<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1256239815256797184">Tesla stock price is too high imo</a>” just a couple of months ago. As of today, the price has nearly doubled since then.</p>



<p>The reason I think it is important for bulls to stop overinflating the price is that for any amount it rises over its fair value, it will likely have to fall at some point, and there are hundreds of billions of dollars on the line for industries, companies, and wealthy individuals that want to see that happen.</p>



<p>In the beginning, Tesla threatened big oil, car makers, and car dealers. If and when they roll out full autonomous driving and trucking, Tesla will be threatening insurance (because autonomous cars are much safer), truckers, unions, Uber, Lyft, and other autonomous competitors like Google. I believe it is conservative to say that hundreds of billions of dollars are praying for Tesla to fail. This massive opposition will not “go softly into that goodnight”, as they say.</p>



<p>To be clear, I am rooting for Tesla all the way. Anyone who knows me knows that. Tesla is an awesome company. But today it is overvalued.</p>

									<p><em>This story is a part of a documentary series produced in collaboration with <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/china-illegal-fishing-fleet/index.html" target="_blank"><strong>NBC News</strong></a> by </em><a href="http://www.theoutlawocean.com/" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.theoutlawocean.com" target="_blank"><strong>The Outlaw Ocean Project</strong></a><em><u><strong>,</strong></u> a </em><em>non-profit journalism organization based in Washington, D.C., that focuses on human rights, labour and environmental crimes at sea.</em>
</p>
<p>For years, no one knew why dozens of battered wooden "ghost boats" were <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/north-korea-japan-ghost-boats-1.3344976" target="_blank"><strong>routinely washing ashore</strong></a> along the coast of Japan, often with the bodies of starved North Korean fishermen reduced to skeletons. 
</p>
<p>An investigation by the journalism organization <strong><a href="https://www.theoutlawocean.com/" target="_blank">The Outlaw Ocean Project</a> </strong>based on satellite data collected over the last two years has revealed, however, what marine researchers now say is the most likely explanation: China is sending an armada of industrial boats to illegally fish in North Korean waters, displacing smaller North Korean boats, forcing them farther out to rougher seas, and spearheading a decline in once-abundant squid stocks of more than 70 per cent. 
</p>
<p>The Chinese vessels — close to 800 last year — appear to be in violation of UN sanctions that forbid foreign fishing in North Korean waters in the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea. The sanctions, imposed in 2017 in response to the country's nuclear tests, were intended to punish North Korea by not allowing it to sell fishing rights in exchange for valuable foreign currency. (Canada is one of the countries <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-un-north-korea-1.5159988" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-un-north-korea-1.5159988" target="_blank"><strong>helping to enforce</strong></a> those sanctions.)

									<p>The number of ships newly revealed in the investigation comprises roughly a third the size of the entire Chinese distant-water fishing fleet. The public and commercial satellite data was analyzed by Outlaw Ocean, Global Fishing Watch and researchers and academics from the U.S., South Korea and Japan. It was also peer-reviewed and published in the academic journal Science Advances.
</p>
<p>"This is the largest known case of illegal fishing perpetrated by a single industrial fleet operating in another nation's waters," said Jaeyoon Park, a data scientist from <u><strong><a href="https://globalfishingwatch.org/our-map/" data-cke-saved-href="https://globalfishingwatch.org/our-map/" target="_blank">Global Fishing Watch</a>,</strong></u> which tracks commercial fishing vessels around the world.</p>

									<p>Presented with the findings, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that, "China has consistently and conscientiously enforced the resolutions of the Security Council relating to North Korea." The ministry said China has "consistently punished" illegal fishing.
</p>
<p>It is unclear whether the North Korean government has authorized the Chinese ships. However, when South Korean Coast Guard authorities have boarded and inspected some of the ships as they traversed South Korean waters on their way to North Korean fishing grounds, the Chinese captains have presented fishing permits signed by North Korean authorities.</p>

																<h2>An elusive but expanding fleet</h2>
								
																					
							
									<p>In March, two countries anonymously complained in <strong><a href="https://undocs.org/S/2020/151" data-cke-saved-href="https://undocs.org/S/2020/151" target="_blank">a report</a></strong> to the United Nations about China's violations of the sanctions and provided satellite imagery of Chinese ships fishing in North Korean waters and testimony from Chinese fishing crew who said they had alerted their government of their plans to fish in North Korean waters.
</p>
<p>Chinese officials dismissed this report, claiming the allegations were unfounded and involved scant few boats. 
</p>
<p>The recent revelations raise thorny questions about the consequences of China's ever-expanding role at sea and the lack of governance of the world's oceans. 
</p>
<p>Estimates of the total size of China's global fishing fleet vary widely. By some calculations, China has anywhere from 200,000 to 800,000 fishing boats, accounting for nearly half of the world's fishing activity. The Chinese government says its distant-water fishing fleet, or those vessels that travel far from China's coast, is roughly 2,600 vessels, but other research, such as <strong><a href="https://www.odi.org/publications/16958-china-s-distant-water-fishing-fleet-scale-impact-and-governance" target="_blank">this study</a> </strong>by the U.K. think-tank ODI, puts the number closer to 17,000, with many of these ships operating undetected, in part by turning off the transponders that allow satellites to track them. 
</p>
<p>By comparison, the United States distant-water fishing fleet has fewer than 300 vessels.

									<p>China is not only the world's biggest seafood exporter. The country's population also accounts for more than a third of all fish consumption worldwide. Having depleted the seas close to home, the Chinese fishing fleet has been sailing farther afield in recent years to exploit the waters of other countries, including those in West Africa and Latin America, where enforcement tends to be weaker as local governments lack resources or inclination to police their waters. Most Chinese distant-water ships are so large that they scoop up as many fish in one week as local boats from Senegal or Mexico might catch in a year. </p>
<p>Many of the Chinese ships combing Latin American waters target forage fish, which is ground into fishmeal, a protein-rich pelletized supplement fed to aquaculture fish. The Chinese fleet has also focused on shrimp and the now endangered totoaba fish, which is much prized in Asia for the alleged medicinal properties of its bladder and can sell for between $1,400 and $4,000 per fish. 
</p>
<p>Nowhere at sea is China more dominant than in squid fishing, as the country's fleet accounts for 50 to 70 per cent of the squid caught in international waters, effectively controlling the global supply of the popular seafood. Half of the squid pulled from the high seas by Chinese fishermen is exported to Europe, north Asia and the U.S. 
</p>
<p>To catch squid, the Chinese typically use trawling nets stretched between two vessels, a practice criticized by marine conservationists because it results in a lot of fish inadvertently and wastefully killed. Critics also accuse China of keeping high-quality squid for domestic consumption, exporting lower-quality products at higher prices, overwhelming vessels from other countries in major squid breeding grounds, and influencing international negotiations about conservation and distribution of global squid resources for its own interest.

																<h2>Subsidizing squid</h2>
								
																					
							
									<p>China's global fishing fleet did not grow into a modern behemoth on its own. The government has robustly subsidized the industry, spending billions of yuan annually. Chinese boats can travel so far partly because of a tenfold increase in diesel fuel subsidies between 2006 and 2011, after which Beijing stopped releasing statistics, according to a Greenpeace study. </p>
<p>For over a decade, the Chinese government has helped pay to construct bigger, more advanced steel-hulled trawlers, even sending medical ships to fishing grounds to enable the fleet to stay at sea longer. The Chinese government supports the squid fleet in particular by providing it with an informational forecast of where to find the most lucrative squid stocks, using data gleaned from satellites and research vessels.
</p>
<p>On its own, distant-water squid fishing is a money-losing business, according to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29881780/" data-cke-saved-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29881780/" target="_blank"><strong>research</strong></a> by Enric Sala, founder and leader of the U.S. National Geographic Society's Pristine Seas project. The sale price of squid typically does not come close to covering the cost of the fuel required to catch the fish, Sala found.
</p>
<p>Still, China is hardly the worst offender when it comes to such subsidies, which ocean conservationists say, through over-capacity and illegal fishing, are a major reason that the oceans are rapidly running out of …</p></div></div></section></article></div></div>

   <p><!--<img align="left" src="../pics/world-internet-320.jpg" alt="World Internet" style="max-width:100%;height:auto; padding:15px;">-->I have always heard that Internet Service Providers in the 
      United States charge more for their services than ISP's in most 
      of the rest of the world.  Since I was curious about the 
      veracity of that claim, I decided to do some research of my own 
      this week.</p>

   <p>The table below gives the results I obtained from a random sampling of 
      Internet service providers around the world.  I simply went onto the 
      Internet and found what I could find with the aid of Google 
      translate.  Getting a more accurate view of things would have taken 
      weeks of research, which was more time than I was prepared to 
      dedicate to this project.  However, I think the data that I have 
      gathered does give a sense of whether US ISP's price their services 
      significantly higher that the norm around the world.</p>

   <p>By the way, I am aware that prices of goods and services in countries 
      tend to track wages, and 
      <a href="https://www.rbth.com/science-and-tech/328998-why-internet-cheap-in-russia">Internet 
      services are no exception</a>.  Were I to do a more "scientific" 
      investigation, I would obtain more data points and normalized the 
      prices I find to the average wages in each country.  One thing I can 
      say is that wages of most developed countries are within about a 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_average_wage">factor 
      of three</a> of each other, and the United States is in the middle of 
      that range.  So, even without normalization, if we compare US prices 
      to those of other developed countries, we should have some idea of 
      whether US prices are much less affordable for consumers.</p>

   </tbody></table>
   <p>I should make a few clarifications.  First, the websites of ISP's 
      often leave out important information--like upload speeds, numbers of 
      months of commitment required with Internet service plans, and types 
      of data transmission line technology.  When I could not find 
      information on the websites of ISP's, I did not include it in the 
      table.  My assumption is that IPS's do not advertise poor upload 
      speeds, so if upload speeds are not posted on their websites, we can 
      safely assume they are low.</p>

   <p>Next, the "Price per Month" column in the table contains the price 
      after any initial promotional prices have ended.  So, this is what 
      most customers should be paying for their Internet service.</p>

   <p>The only types of Internet service plans shown in the table are DSL 
      and fiber optic cable plans.  (UPDATE: I assume that cable TV
      transmission lines were used in some of the plans for which the 
      Website advertisements did not specify their transmission line 
      technology.  I did not specifically intend to exclude those plans 
      from consideration.)  Since cheapskatesguide.org is about 
      finding the best deals, I excluded from consideration categories of 
      Internet services that I feel are not good deals.  Plans with large 
      data caps are the best bargains for most customers in terms of bytes 
      received per dollar paid.  As a result, I only looked at Internet 
      service plans with data caps that are similar to the one-terabyte-cap 
      plans that we have in the United States.  For the same reason, I did 
      not include any cell phone Internet service plans in the table.  I did 
      not include satellite Internet providers in the table either, because 
      satellite Internet service is generally more expensive.  Although 
      dial-up Internet service is very cheap and still being offered by a 
      few companies, I did not include any of them in the table.  Dial-up 
      service is just too slow for surfing the Internet these days.  
      However, if you still have a land-line telephone connection and a 
      modem, are heavily into email and text-only websites, and don't do 
      much else, you may want to look into dial-up services.</p>

   <p>Many plans had details associated with them that I did not show in 
      the table.  Some included things like phone service and TV.  I mostly 
      did not mention those details, because customers cannot get Internet 
      services from the listed companies without those extras.  Also, some 
      ISP's have additional constraints that I did not mention.  For 
      example, Maisha Broadband in Tanzania has higher bandwidths at night 
      than during the day.  I reported the daytime speeds and ignored the 
      nighttime speeds.  Another example is that Virgin Connect in Russia 
      charges much higher rates to single family homes than to apartments.  
      Your guess is a good as mine about why that is.  I simply reported 
      the monthly rates for apartment dwellers.  I also ignored installation 
      fees, since I believe most customers keep the same service for many 
      years.  So, the added cost of installation fees is usually 
      negligible.  Many ISP's have four or five tiers of service.  In those 
      cases, I chose to report only the plans from each provider with the 
      the slowest connection speed, the fastest, and an intermediate 
      speed.</p>

   <p>I had great difficulty getting information on African ISP's.  Most of 
      their websites were unreachable.  Most of those that were online did 
      not offer wired internet connections.  Most only offered some kind of 
      wireless or satellite connection.</p>

   <p>I want to remind readers that the prices in the table are the ISP's 
      <i>advertised prices</i> during the middle of July of 2020.  If you 
      have had experiences like mine, you will likely understand that you 
      may not be offered a plan with the advertised speeds and prices.  
      For example, one of the two ISP's that serve my small city in the 
      United States, and the one I happen to use, advertises plans with the 
      following download speeds on their national website: 10, 18, 25, 50, 
      and 100 Mbits/s.  I called my ISP last week to ask about their fastest 
      service in my city and was told that it is 10 Mbits/s.  I was also 
      told that the price was $10 above their advertised price after taking 
      into account taxes and equipment fees.</p>

   <p>How does my ISP get away with providing nothing faster than their 
      slowest advertised connection, and over charging for it at that?  I 
      live in a city that contains a significant population of 
      professionals, including a large percentage of engineers.  So you 
      would think that we would demand better.  Most likely thanks to a deal 
      that our city has made with the local Internet service providers, the 
      only alternative ISP in my city is the cable TV provider.  When I 
      tried to contact them, I found that no phone number was listed 
      anywhere on their website.  I eventually found their phone number 
      through other means and contacted them.  After a 10 minute hold, their 
      representative gave me the information I needed.  They have comparable 
      prices to those advertised by my ISP, and they have plans available 
      in my area with higher speeds.  Unfortunately, many customer reviews 
      say their service is unreliable.  So, given a choice between an 
      organization that has unsatisfactory customer service and reliability 
      and one that in my opinion has good customer service but slow 
      Internet speed, I choose the later.  My guess is that this is what we 
      must live with when our local governments decide to sell us out by 
      allowing monopoly or duopoly ISP's to operate in cities all across 
      the United States.</p>

   <p>Companies that provide Internet Services also engage in some 
      distasteful practices.  Generally, not only do prices of Internet 
      services differ from the advertised prices, but they differ according 
      to who you speak to at a particular company.  Yes, you understood what 
      I meant to say.  You will often find that when you call company X and 
      ask the price of their plan Y, you will be told one price, and when </p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
	
	<div>
		<p>This article is talking about my experience learning how to program. However, most of it is relevant to learning any subject.</p><hr><div><p>Picture this scene in slow-motion. &nbsp;A Half-lit room. Nighttime and light rain. The smell of dark and creamy chocolate milk. And my keyboard mid-air about to smash on the wall into little pieces.</p><p>My first line of code was written before the large Q&amp;A communities were created (Stack Overflow and Reddit). There wasn't so much support, very little technical, and nonexistent emotional. I'm glad that programming in particular, and learning in general, became so communal.</p><p>Many things that bothered me back then, still riddle new programmers. I want to talk about the things that nagged me, in the back of my head, constantly, that now I know are nothing to worry about. Things that are part of the process and progress:</p></div><h3 id="am-i-good-enough">Am I good enough?</h3><p>Programming is not reserved for the elite. The only criteria for being able to learn how to program is if you are able to sit down and spend the needed time.</p><h3 id="it-takes-so-much-time-">It takes so much time:</h3><p>Yes, it does, so invest the time and don't worry about it. Learning how to program combines learning a new language, and learning abstract concepts. Both are time-consuming.</p><h3 id="i-feel-like-there-s-something-i-should-know-that-i-don-t-">I feel like there's something I should know that I don't:</h3><div><p>There must be something that I missed!</p><p>A very common feeling. Like there are missing pieces of the puzzle that prevent you from fully understanding, even when you follow a pre-designed curriculum.</p><p>Just keep pushing forward, there are probably concepts that you still don't understand well, and as the layout of the language becomes clearer, you'll know what you should work on to feel more confident. Confidence comes with time.</p></div><h3 id="i-feel-demotivated-">I feel demotivated:</h3><div><p>Motivation is like inspiration, it's for amateurs. I'm talking about the type that we feel from time to time, that makes us stand up, blood flowing strongly in our veins, wanting to change our lives. Don't give it too much thought when you feel it diminishing.</p><p>What you need is dedication, to persevere even when not feeling like it, and for that, a good schedule works well. Also, remind yourself why you're learning this in the first place.</p><p>Having a project, and building something you care about along the learning, really helps with the "why", and will help you put it the needed hours. It's also more fun.<br>Remember, learning is hard, don't let the world sell you a sugar-coated idea of learning becoming easy and flowing, "if you just follow this method, that costs $995 (regularly $5999!) on sale right now, for fast decision-makers".</p></div><h3 id="feeling-stuck-and-tutorial-purgatory-">Feeling stuck and tutorial purgatory:</h3><div><p>Yes, this happens from time to time. If you feel it, then you probably should either get out of your comfort zone and proceed to more advanced content, or, you weren't persistent, and a month or two after you don't feel that you made any progress.</p><p>There's no advancing without time and persistence, and it's better to learn 1 hour every day than 10 hours every Sunday.</p><p>If you'll persist with one good tutorial, you'll outgrow it quickly enough and feel comfortable taking on more advanced materials.</p><p>Also, practice. After every lesson, try to implement it. Either in a "dry" manner, just as it was shown in the lesson, or even better, on your own project. Try to find uses for what you've learned.</p></div><h3 id="time-management-">Time Management:</h3><div><p>A very important topic. Time management is usually the pitfall of learners. Some helping rules: create a schedule and stick to it! Don't start big, an hour a day is a good start. No need for 10-hour marathons.</p><p>Since learning is costly (mentally and cognitively), place the learning period at a time of the day when you are lively. Don't place it in the dead zones, the times of the day when you know you can't really get anything else done.</p></div><p>I look at code repositories of other developers, and I don't understand anything!<br>Neither do I most of the time. It takes time to understand another developer's code. I usually have to sit down and study the code and play with it to know the ropes. </p><div><p>Sometimes it takes a lot of time. It depends on the project complexity and how organized and well documented was the other developer.</p><p>I'm terrible at documenting, or can you really be terrible at something you don't do at all :)? So it's not really a treat looking at my codebase, plus I have to do a lot of explaining with each collaboration. </p></div><p>Be a better programmer than I am and practice documenting your code. Explain what functions do. Even if it's only for yourself.</p><h3 id="again-with-the-code-of-other-developers-i-ll-never-be-able-to-build-something-so-complex-and-elaborate-">Again with the code of other developers. I'll never be able to build something so complex and elaborate:</h3><p>No one writes 10K lines of code at a time. Even those big projects you see on GitHub started with just a few lines of code. </p><div><p>The code adds up with each day of programming, and a couple of months after, you suddenly find yourself with a respectable project. Provided that you were persistent!</p><p>Even those repositories that have many collaborators and a huge codebase usually start with 1 person writing few lines of code. You've got to start from somewhere.</p></div><h3 id="oh-dear-god-the-stupid-bugs-">Oh dear god, the stupid bugs:</h3><p>Yup. Still happens to me too from time to time.</p><h3 id="i-can-t-remember-the-commands-is-my-brain-weak">I can't remember the commands! Is my brain weak?</h3><div><p>As stated before, it's like learning a language, and you need to practice to get the vocabulary into your head. To be honest, I still look for simple things from on google sometimes. It's mostly things I don't use a lot.</p><p>A guy I follow tweeted: "Hello my name is Joby, I have a PhD in Physics and I work for NASA and I just had to look up the equation for the volume of a sphere". If he is allowed, you and I are allowed as well.</p></div><h3 id="good-programmers-must-write-code-as-fast-as-they-can-type-and-i-m-so-slow-">Good programmers must write code as fast as they can type, and I'm so slow:</h3><p>No, they don't (there are exceptions). and you'll get faster with time.</p><h3 id="i-can-t-build-anything-real-until-i-am-a-professional-">I can't build anything real until I am a professional:</h3><p>Sure you can. Think you've just learned Italian. It's still kind of bad, but you can carry a conversation good enough to get around Italy! Sure it will be better in 3 years, but it is still functional right now!<br>The same thing happens in programming. You can build functional things as a beginner. Sure, the code can probably be significantly improved, but it works! It'll do the job, and that's what code is for. for doing the job!</p><p>Now another language?!?! I'm not good enough in this one!<br>Once you understand the major programming concepts and feel comfortable enough to build things in one language, you'll feel more confident to learn a new one when needed. You don't have to be a professor in one language before you acquire a new one.<br>Make sure you don't just jump around from one language to another, but if you spent enough time with one to the point where you can effectively use it, don't be shy to try a new one.</p><hr><h2 id="conclusion-">Conclusion:</h2><div><p>If there's one thing that repeated itself in this article, is that you have to invest the time, and do it persistently. Time and persistence will solve most of your problems.</p><p>Regarding issues of confidence, they go away with time and persistence as well.<br>Know that many people share these worries. You're not alone. </p></div><p>I'm very pragmatic in my approach to learning. I don't think there's much more to it than time and persistence. I also think that anyone telling you differently is trying to sell you something. A special and costly method or service that will learn for you! "On sale, only today, for early birds and fast thinkers". Time and dedication!!! It's that simple.</p><p><br>Good learning resources are important but those you can find in abundance. Just take the top-rated Udemy courses or any other recommended resources. Follow them without jumping from one to another, and you'll surely get there.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<p>Our backend system is built on <strong>AWS</strong>. Today I’m going to tell you how we had cut costs three times for the servers by using spot instances on the production environment. I’ll also walk you through configuring auto scaling. Firstly, you will see the overview of how it works and then we provide the instruction to launch it.</p><h2 id="what-are-spot-instances">What are spot instances?</h2><blockquote>Amazon EC2 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/">Spot instances</a> are spare compute capacity in the AWS cloud available at steep discounts. &nbsp;Amazon says they can reach 90%, in our experience, it is ~3x, varies depending on the region, AZ or instance type. Their main difference from the regular ones is that they can be shut down at any time.</blockquote><p>That’s why for a long time we thought it was okay to use them for DEV environments, or for calculating tasks with saving the intermediate result to S3 or database but not for PROD. There are third-party solutions that allow using spots for PROD, but we didn’t implement it due to numerous kludges to our case. The approach described in the article fully works within standard AWS capabilities, without additional scripts, crons, etc.</p><p>Next, I’m going to provide some screenshots which show spot instances pricing history.</p><p><strong>m5.large</strong> in <strong>eu-west-1</strong> region (Ireland). The price is predominantly stable within three months, cost-savings now are <strong>2.9x</strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/2020/07/image-13.png" srcset="https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-13.png 600w, https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-13.png 1000w, https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/image-13.png 1600w, https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/image-13.png 2400w"></figure><p><strong>m5.large</strong> in <strong>us-east-1</strong> region (N.

It sends requests to <em>EC2 Target Group</em> (TG). TG is responsible for opening ports on the instances for ALB and connecting them to the container ports of <em>Elastic Container Service</em> (ECS). ECS is an analog of <em>Kubernetes</em> in AWS, which manages <em>Docker</em> containers.</p><p>One instance can have multiple functioning containers with the same ports that’s why we cannot assign them fixed. ECS reports to TG that it launches a new task (in Kubernetes terminology it is called <em>“Pod”</em>). It checks free ports on the instance and assigns one of them for the new launching task. Also, TG regularly checks if the instance and API are functioning with a health check. If it sees any problem, it stops sending requests there.</p><h4 id="ec2-auto-scaling-groups-ecs-capacity-providers-">EC2 Auto Scaling Groups + ECS Capacity Providers.</h4><p>In the diagram above, the <em>EC2 Auto Scaling Groups</em> (ASG) service is not indicated. We can learn from the title that it is in charge of auto scaling. However, AWS didn’t have built-in capability to manage the number of running machines from ECS until recently. ECS allowed scaling the number of tasks, for example, based on CPU or RAM usage or the number of requests. But if the tasks took all the available instances, new machines were not launched automatically.</p><p>This changed with <em>ECS Capacity Providers</em> (ECS CP). Every service in ECS can now be linked with ASG. And, if the tasks don’t have enough running instances, more instances will be started (but within the established limits of ASG). It works the other way around as well. If ECS CP sees standing idle instances, without tasks, it will command ASG to shut them down. ECS CP can indicate the target capacity percent of instancesso that a certain number of machines would always be available for rapid task scaling. We’ll talk about it later.</p><h4 id="ec2-launch-templates-">EC2 Launch Templates.</h4><p>Before describing the creation of the infrastructure, the last service I’m going to talk about is <em>EC2 Launch Templates</em>. It allows creating a template to launch all the machines to avoid repeating it every time from scratch. Here you can choose the type of the launching machine, security group, disk image, and lots of other parameters. It’s possible to indicate user data as well that will be uploaded to all the running instances. You can run scripts in the user data, for example, you can edit the content of<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-config.html"> ECS agent configuration file</a>.</p><p>One of the most important configuration parameters in this article is<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container-instance-spot.html"> ECS_ENABLE_SPOT_INSTANCE_DRAINING</a>=true. If this parameter is <em>turned on</em>, then as soon as ECS receives a signal that the spot instance is being taken, it switches all its running tasks into <strong>Draining</strong> status. <em>No new tasks</em> will be assigned for this instance. If there are any tasks that are <strong>Pending</strong> on this instance, ECS cancels them. It no longer receives the requests from the balancer as well. You get the notification about deleting the instance two minutes before it happens. In this regard, if your service doesn’t execute the task for more than two minutes and doesn’t save anything to the disk, you can use spot instances without losing any data.</p><p>Talking about the disk, AWS has recently<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/04/amazon-ecs-aws-fargate-support-amazon-efs-filesystems-generally-available/#:~:text=To%20use%20EFS%20with%20ECS,or%20TLS%20encryption%20in%20transit."> made</a> it possible to use <em>Elastic File System</em> (EFS) with ECS. Even using the disk with this approach is not an obstacle, but we haven’t tested it, because we don’t need the disk to store the status. After receiving <strong>SIGINT</strong> by default (it is sent in the moment of task switch into <strong>Draining</strong> status) all the running tasks will be stopped in 30 sec, even if they haven’t completed. You can change this time with<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-config.html"> ECS_CONTAINER_STOP_TIMEOUT</a> parameter. The main rule is not to set it for more than 2 minutes for spot machines.</p><h2 id="-reating-a-service-">Сreating a service.</h2><p>Let’s proceed directly to create the described service. I’ll describe some useful features that were not mentioned above.</p><p>Generally, it’s a step-by-step instruction, but I won’t mention any basic or more specific cases. All the operations are made in <em>AWS Management Console</em>, but you can achieve the same results with <em>CloudFormation</em> or <em>Terraform</em>. We use Terraform in Adapty.</p><h4 id="ec2-launch-template-">EC2 Launch Template.</h4><p>With this service, you can create a configuration of machines. You can manage the templates in <em>EC2</em> → <em>Instances</em> → <em>Launch templates</em>.</p><p>Amazon machine image (AMI). Specify the disk image which will be used by instances. For ECS, in most cases, it’s better to use an optimized image from Amazon. It is regularly updated and contains everything necessary for ECS functioning. To find out the relevant image ID, go to<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI.html"> Amazon ECS-optimized AMIs</a> page, choose the region, and copy AMI ID for it. For example, for us-east-1 region, relevant image ID at the time of this writing — <em>ami-00c7c1cf5bdc913ed</em>. You need to paste this ID to <strong>Specify a custom value</strong> section.</p><p><strong>Instance type.</strong> Specify an instance type. Choose the one that is best suited for your task.</p><p><strong>Key pair (login).</strong> Specify the certificate for SSH connection.</p><p><strong>Network settings.</strong> Specify network settings. The <strong>networking platform</strong> in most cases should be Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). <strong>Security groups</strong> serve to protect your instances. Since we’re going to use the balancer in front of the instances, I would recommend specifying the group which allows inbound connection only from the balancer. That means you will have two security groups: one for the balancer which allows inbound connections from anywhere via <em>80 (http)</em> and <em>443 (https)</em> ports, and the other one for the machines which allows inbound connections via any port from the balancer group. We have to open outbound connections in both the groups via <em>TCP protocol</em> to all the ports for all the addresses. We can limit the ports and addresses for the outbound connections, but in that case, &nbsp;it is necessary to constantly monitor that you’re not trying to address anywhere via the closed port.</p><p><strong><strong>Storage (volumes). </strong></strong>Specify the disk parameters for the machines. Disk capacity can’t be less than the one specified in AMI, for ECS Optimized, it is 30 GiB.</p><p><strong>Advanced details.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Purchasing option.</strong> </strong>It asks whether we want to buy spot instances. We do but <u>don’t mark</u> the checkbox here. We’ll configure it in <em>Auto Scaling Group</em>, it has more options there.</p><p><strong>IAM instance profile.</strong> Specify the role for the the instances. The instances need access rights to operate within ECS. The access rights are usually defined in <em>ecsInstanceRole</em>. In some cases, the role is existing in your AWS account. If not then here is the<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/instance_IAM_role.html"> instruction</a> on how to do it. After its creation, specify it in the template.</p><p>Next, there are a lot of parameters, basically, you can leave the default, but each of them has a comprehensible description. I always turn on <em>EBS-optimized instance</em> and <em>T2/T3 Unlimited</em> parameters, if we use<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-performance-instances.html"> burstable</a> instances.</p><p><strong>User data.</strong> Specify user data. We will edit the file <em>/etc/ecs/ecs.config</em> which stores the ECS agent configuration.</p><p>Here is the example of how user data may look like:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>#!/bin/bash
echo ECS_CLUSTER=DemoApiClusterProd &gt;&gt; /etc/ecs/ecs.config
echo ECS_ENABLE_SPOT_INSTANCE_DRAINING=true &gt;&gt; /etc/ecs/ecs.config
echo ECS_CONTAINER_STOP_TIMEOUT=1m &gt;&gt; /etc/ecs/ecs.config
echo ECS_ENGINE_AUTH_TYPE=docker &gt;&gt; /etc/ecs/ecs.config
echo "ECS_ENGINE_AUTH_DATA={\"registry.gitlab.com\":{\"username\":\"username\",\"password\":\"password\"}}" &gt;&gt; /etc/ecs/ecs.config
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p><strong>ECS_CLUSTER=DemoApiClusterProd</strong> — this parameter indicates that the instance belongs to a cluster with the given name which means this cluster will be able to place their tasks on this server. We still haven’t created a cluster, but we will use this name when creating it.</p><p><strong>ECS_ENABLE_SPOT_INSTANCE_DRAINING=true</strong> — the parameter points that after receiving a spot instance turn off signal, all the tasks must be switched to Draining status.</p><p><strong>ECS_CONTAINER_STOP_TIMEOUT=1m</strong> — the parameter indicates that after receiving the SIGINT signal, all the tasks have one minute before being killed.</p><p><strong>ECS_ENGINE_AUTH_TYPE=docker</strong> — the parameter indicates that we use a docker-scheme as an authentication format.</p><p><strong>ECS_ENGINE_AUTH_DATA=...</strong> — these are the parameters of the connection to a private container registry, where all your Docker images are stored. If they are public there is no need to specify anything else.</p><p>In this article I will use a public image from <em>Docker Hub</em>, there is no need to indicate <strong>ECS_ENGINE_AUTH_TYPE</strong> and <strong>ECS_ENGINE_AUTH…</strong></p></section></div>

<h2>The container revolution</h2>



<p>Information and Communication Technologies have evolved at a really fast pace over the past few years, changing dramatically the way information systems and applications are built. Software development has brought along many changes and revolutions, allowing people to focus now mainly on the business applications. The key drivers of this shift have been (1) to be able to package and run applications anywhere regardless of the underlying computing architecture, and (2) to keep applications isolated from each other to avoid security risks and interference during operations or maintenance processes.</p>



<p>Keeping applications isolated on the same host or cluster can be difficult due to the packages, libraries and other software components that are normally required to run them. <strong>Hardware virtualization</strong> was a solution to this problem, since applications could be kept apart on the same hardware by using Virtual Machines. Packaging an application within a VM allowed also to run it on any infrastructure that supported virtualization, which provided a lot of flexibility to the whole concept.However, Virtual Machines come with some <strong>serious limitations</strong>: moving them around is not that easy, since they are typically quite heavy and there are always difficulties associated with maintaining and upgrading applications running within a VM.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In recent years, we have all witnessed how <strong>container technologies</strong> have revolutionized the way enterprise and distributed applications are being developed and deployed. Containers clearly offer a more portable and flexible way of packaging, maintaining and running applications. They allow admins to deploy, move and replicate workloads more quickly and easily than using Virtual Machines. While containers as a concept have been around for a while, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a> was the technology that introduced several crucial changes to the existing container technology, making containers more portable and flexible to use. This resulted in a turning point towards the adoption of <strong>containerization and microservices</strong> in software development (e.g. cloud-native development).</p>



<p>Docker gave us an easy way to create container-based applications, and to package them in portable images containing the specifications for which software components the container will run. Docker’s technology brought <strong>cloud-like flexibility</strong> to any infrastructure capable of running containers, with their container image tools allowing developers to build libraries of images, compose applications from multiple images, and launch those containers and applications on local or remote infrastructure alike.</p>







<h2>Orchestrating containers</h2>



<p>Nowadays, many companies have embraced a cloud-native paradigm in developing applications and have shifted from a “monolithic” approach to a microservice approach. While deploying a single container can be an easy task, <strong>things get a bit more complicated when deploying multi-container applications</strong> on distributed hosts given that in these cases a Docker engine alone is not enough.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is where <strong>container orchestrators</strong> (like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a> or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/" target="_blank">Docker Swarm</a>) play an important role in scheduling containers to run on different servers, moving containers to a new host when the host becomes unhealthy, restarting containers when they fail, managing overlay networks to allow containers on different hosts to communicate, orchestrating storage to provide persistent volumes to stateful applications, and so on.</p>



<p>However, container technologies (e.g. Docker, Kubernetes) also come with some serious limitations, such as for example <strong>security </strong>(application containers share the kernel OS) and<strong> multi-tenant environments. </strong>In order to provide a multi-tenant and secure environment to deploy containerized applications one has to provision different “virtual environments” to each user or group of users, typically by deploying several isolated Kubernetes clusters on top of a Cloud Management Platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The CMP is then responsible to manage and orchestrate the underlying virtual resources (i.e. virtual machines, virtual networks and storage) that are used by the different Kubernetes deployments that are in charge of scheduling application containers within those isolated environments. This approach <strong>adds an extra control layer</strong> that ends up<strong> increasing management complexity, resource consumption and operational costs.</strong></p>



<div><figure><img src="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/logos_5-12.png" alt="" srcset="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/logos_5-12.png 600w, https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/logos_5-12-300x53.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></figure></div>



<h2>OpenNebula’s combined approach</h2>



<p><strong>But what if we could remove one of those layers?</strong> Cloud Management Platforms such as <strong>OpenNebula</strong> have been implemented with multi-tenancy and security by design, providing already powerful orchestration features but for VM-based applications (e.g. networking, storage blocks, high availability with live/cold migrations, etc.). And with the release of version <a href="https://opennebula.io/firework/">5.12 “Firework”</a>, OpenNebula has gone a step further to offer a <strong>pioneering approach</strong> that merges the strengths of a Cloud Management Platform with the many benefits of container technologies.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>OpenNebula</strong> announced a few months ago that <a href="https://opennebula.io/firecracker/">Firecracker</a> would be incorporated as a new supported virtualization technology. This microVM technology, developed by <strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</strong> and widely used as part of its <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/">Fargate</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">Lambda</a> services, has been especially designed for creating and managing secure, multi-tenant container and function-based services. OpenNebula has managed to <strong>bridge the gap between two technological worlds</strong>, leaving behind the old dilemma between using containers—lighter but with weaker security—or Virtual Machines—with strong security but high overhead.</p>



<p>By adopting the increasingly popular approach of running microservices based on containerized applications, and thanks to its<strong> native integration with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hub.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker Hub</a></strong>, OpenNebula has now become a powerful alternative to deploy and orchestrate containers as secure and fast micro-VMs. This solution combines all the features of a solid CMP but<strong> without adding extra layers</strong> of orchestration, thus reducing the complexity, resource consumption and operational costs.</p>



<p>We have just embarked ourselves in this <strong>amazing journey</strong> towards creating a truly innovative model for deploying and running containerized applications, based on combining <strong>two fascinating technologies</strong>: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://opennebula.io/firecracker/" target="_blank">OpenNebula and Firecracker</a>. In the next months we’ll be working hard to improve and get the most out of this new integration, and to make it as easy as possible for admins and developers to use OpenNebula as a solution for their needs. Fasten your seat belts and enjoy the flight! 🚀</p>







<p>PS – <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://opennebula.io/opennebula-kubernetes-comparing-two-container-orchestration-models/" target="_blank">Here</a> you can see a full comparison between <strong>OpenNebula and Kubernetes</strong>. And if you are interested in trying by yourself OpenNebula’s new integration with Firecracker and Docker Hub, here you have a screencast (part of this <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/en-us/articles/360045029871-How-to-Use-miniONE-to-Deploy-a-Firecracker-Cloud-Integrated-with-Docker-Hub-on-AWS" target="_blank">step-by-step tutorial</a>) on how to deploy a one-node Firecracker cloud on an <strong>AWS bare-metal server</strong>:</p>

			<p><span>W</span>ith <i>Hamilton</i> on my mind, I had a fanciful thought while reading the new book <i>Love Drugs: The Chemical Future of Relationships</i>. The Founding Father, stressed and tired and focused on getting his bill for a national bank through Congress, could have saved himself a lot of grief if, in his moment of weakness with the temptress Maria Reynolds, he’d had an anti-love drug to cool his loins. Instead his response to her feminine wiles, as conjured by Lin-Manuel Miranda, is to pray, “Lord, show me how to say no to this.” It didn’t prove effective.</p> <p>Love drugs harken back to fairytale fantasies about potions and spells, but the notion isn’t purely fiction. The authors of <i>Love Drugs</i>—Julian Savulescu, an Oxford philosopher, and Brian Earp, a Yale doctoral candidate in philosophy and psychology—make plain that our brain’s love, lust, and attachment systems can be affected by real-life neuro-technologies. With cogent arguments, vivid experimental detail, and engaging storytelling, the authors show that chemical interventions to foster, enhance, and diminish love will only become more sophisticated as scientists discern the biochemical nature of the romantic bond.</p> <p>Aficionados of Aldous Huxley’s <i>The Doors of Perception</i> and <i>Brave New World</i> will find <i>Love Drugs</i> both entertaining and sobering. In fact, <i>Love Drugs</i> was almost titled <i>Brave New Love</i>. “There is a part of me that still prefers <i>Brave New Love</i>,” Earp says. “I think a lot of people think this is a pro-love drugs book. We tried not to do that. This is not ‘science will fix all of our problems.’ A title like <i>Brave New Love</i> says, ‘There’s a real danger here.’ Maybe if I could wave a magic wand I’d go back to <i>Brave New Love</i>. But it is what it is.”</p> <p>I was excited to speak to Earp, a research fellow in the Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics at Oxford. I first learned of him in 2011 from YouTube. At the time, Earp was getting his master’s degree in psychology at Oxford, which was where philosopher and neuroscientist Sam Harris happened to be giving a talk on his then-new book <i>The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values</i>. Earp, skeptical of the ostensible novelty of his thesis, incisively asked him to defend it. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuuTOpZxwRk" target="_blank">recording of the exchange</a> has almost 2 million views. In our conversation, Earp didn’t disappoint. He was as thoughtful and careful and smart in his responses to me as I expected him to be.</p><figure data-alt="Gallagher_BREAKER"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/17447_cc0c490aab832307f9cd2ebad8fa114e.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>Higher Love:</strong> Brian Earp (above) says his intellectual foray into romantic relationships, with Love Drugs, is consistent with the wider transhumanist tradition of considering how we can “use new technologies to intervene in our biology to help us meet our higher goals.”</span><span>Rob Judges</span></figcaption></figure> <p><b>What are the possible effects of drugs on love?</b></p> <p>One possibility is that people will begin to see that love is something that is at least partly in our command. Many believe the opposite is the case, that love is a mysterious thing that just happens to you if you meet the right person. You might fall into and potentially fall out of love, but there’s not much you can really do about it. There’s something about this view that is potentially immature, in that it may prevent us from exercising our agency to try to work on the love that we share with someone to whom we’re committed. We’re never going to have a magic potion, like in <i>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</i>, that just causes you to feel a certain kind of love for somebody. But we can nudge the probability that we’ll have a certain kind of loving relationship with someone, or they will be able to enhance certain aspects of that loving relationship.</p> <p><b>What biological chemicals underpin love?</b></p> <p>The attachment system is underwritten by oxytocin and vasopressin, and some other neurochemicals. Lots of things go into libido. One of them is testosterone, and testosterone levels can be manipulated. Similarly, serotonin is involved in attraction. People have noticed that there are similarities in certain aspects of feeling in the early stages of attraction to somebody and in obsessive compulsive disorder. Both of these things seem to turn on serotonin levels.</p> <p><b>How do you tweak these biological systems?</b></p> <p>You can’t tweak these things like independent knobs. Instead we have these really big blunt-style effects that operate across multiple systems. If you depress libido with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, for example, you can lose interest in being physically intimate with your partner. That means you’re not going to be releasing oxytocin as you would naturally. That has potential to degrade your attachment bond over time. You can start to have a looping effect. On the other hand, if you’re riddled with depression, and you’re among the subset of people for whom SSRIs are helpful in treating the symptoms of depression, maybe you’re lucky that the SSRI doesn’t diminish your libido. In that case, one and the same drug could potentially be a relationship helper.</p><blockquote><p>Psilocybin seems to temporarily wash out prior relationship assumptions so that you are seeing anew.</p> </blockquote><p><b>You write about the potential benefits of psychoactive drugs. How can they affect our love systems?</b><br></p> <p>The psychedelics and MDMA, or ecstasy, are more global drugs. You wouldn’t use them for a precise intervention on a subroutine of your neurochemistry. Rather they have a global effect in altering our disposition toward our partner and our emotions, where we can engage meaningfully with the content of our relationship. MDMA can cause feelings of warmth and closeness, at least under the influence of the drug. But it can also cause a sense of openness to talking about emotions that otherwise might be scary to talk about. People in recent trials say they feel more loving toward those around them, more interested in taking things from other people’s perspective, and more mentally flexible, so that if somebody says something that might have hurt their feelings before, they don’t immediately take it in just that one way.</p> <p><b>What’s going on in our brains that might explain how psychedelics can help our love lives?</b></p> <p>Our view is the brain is a big Bayesian prediction mechanism. We try to predict what’s going on in the world as efficiently as possible. Once we notice certain patterns or regularities, we just store that as an expectation. Then we continue to interpret the world in light of those prior beliefs. But some of these prior beliefs can just be ruts that we get stuck in. I’ve had a certain number of arguments with my partner, and I just start to interpret everything that they say in light of my prior conclusions about what was going on, rather than being able to hear them in a new way. I just can’t be bothered or I’m too defensive or whatever it is. What psilocybin seems to do is temporarily wash out some of these prior assumptions so that you are seeing anew, you’re taking in information without prejudging it as much as you might have in the past. So for people who are stuck in a rut, who can’t seem to talk their way out of a rut, having a drug that directly suppresses these problematic priors and allows you to look at the world with fresh eyes could be really helpful.</p><div>

</div> <p><b>What’s the danger of love drugs?</b></p> <p>It seems like love drugs are ripe for abuse. They’re not a panacea. They’re not something that just everybody should try. They have to be used under particular circumstances, where people have been properly screened. And we have to keep developing the evidence for when, and under what conditions, they’ll be helpful rather than harmful. It’s easy to get carried away because some of these drugs, the psychedelics, are very powerful. Many people who try them feel transformed by them. We need to decide what we want our future to look like. We haven’t even taken care to properly study the interpersonal effects of medications we already use. That’s a risk that is unfolding under our very noses. For the most part, we’re just stumbling along without thinking carefully about the ethical and the normative implications of using love drugs.</p> <p><b>What does a drug-assisted therapy session look like?</b></p> <p>There’s a small pilot study happening where some of the researchers who are involved in psilocybin for PTSD trials are bringing in the PTSD sufferer’s partner, and both of them are undergoing psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy. A couple first has multiple interactions with a therapist to establish the therapeutic relationship. They’ll talk about what they hope to get out of the experience. They’ll be counseled on the effects these drugs can have. Part of the effect of the drug is how you relate to what’s going on when you’re in an altered state of consciousness in a therapeutic context. Then, separately, each one will be made comfortable, probably given eyeshades and some headphones, and they’ll take a dose of the drug. With the therapist there to help respond to any concerns that may arise, the couple will reflect on their own emotions. They will talk with the therapist and then with each other, when they’re ready, about how they’re going to implement whatever lessons they feel they’ve learned as the effects of the drug are wearing off. In some cases, people report that six months or a year after their sessions they still feel more mentally flexible and more able to deal with conflict in a productive manner.</p><blockquote><p>MDMA can cause a sense of openness to talking about emotions that otherwise might be scary to talk about.</p> </blockquote><p><b>If someone says that using love drugs is an easy solution that avoids the tough work of a loving relationship, how do you respond?</b><br></p> <p>One reason why people have that worry is they think that if something feels like a quick fix, it simply won’t work or won’t be effective over the long run. Or it will be a replacement for dealing with the underlying issues that are really important. I would agree with that. But if there’s a drug that enhances your ability to engage with what’s really going on with the relationship, and that therefore makes it more likely that the changes you make are going to be long-lasting and rooted …</p></div></div>

GPT-3 is a natural language model that, given some examples, tries to predict appropriate text output for a given text input. Since code is just text, there's the question of whether it can be used to produce code based only on a description of what the code should do. And, amazing world that we live in, there are already some early<!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 49 --> <!-- /react-text --><a href="https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1282676454690451457" data-reactid="50">tech demos</a><!-- react-text: 51 --> <!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 52 -->of exactly that.<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="54">A common off-the-cuff reaction to such demos is that this sort of technology will inevitably make Software Engineers obsolete, because if an AI can produce more or less what they produce, then seemingly we won't need to pay them to do it anymore.</p><p data-reactid="55">The reasoning for these kinds of claims is understandable. If your premise is that a Software Engineer's job is to take a description of what some software should do, and write code to implement that, then it makes sense to view technology like this as a drop-in replacement.</p><p data-reactid="56">But that's not right. What a Software Engineer really does is build software solutions to solve problems appropriately. That seems like a subtle distinction, but it's a really important one. Code is not the solution, it's the implementation of a solution. The solution certainly requires that code be written, hence the ability to write code. But going the other direction, the ability to write code does not imply the ability to create appropriate solutions to problems.</p><p data-reactid="57">I think because writing code is intrinsically a difficult skill which is opaque and unfamiliar to outsiders, it appears like the hard part of building software is in fact writing code. But it really isn't, and that's the point. The hard part is solving the problem appropriately. Implementing that solution in code once you have it is comparatively easy.</p><p data-reactid="58">This is counter-intuitive, and I don't think it's something that can be fully appreciated without having gone through the process of building software yourself. Without this insight, it does indeed seem like an AI writing code opens up the possibility of generalists building software, just by describing their ideas. But that's no more true than saying that hiring a skilled ghost writer opens up the possibility for anybody with a story idea to write a great novel.</p><p data-reactid="60">So, I understand the basis of these claims from an outsider's perspective. They are reasonable given the premises they're based on. What does surprise me a bit, though, is the common rebuttals that seem to come up from insiders - Software Engineers themselves.</p><p data-reactid="61">There are two main forms. The first is "this will never work": pointing out all the technical difficulties of such a thing in practice. The other is "it's all just code anyway": the notion that the natural language description of any software past a certain point of complexity would have to be structured and formalised to the extent that it basically becomes code.</p><p data-reactid="62"><!-- react-text: 63 -->I find these rebuttals surprising not because they're necessarily wrong. They're actually very practical - the thing has to basically work before the rest of the conversation is relevant, after all, and we're still a very long way from that. I find them surprising more just because they meet the claims at their own level, seeming to implicitly accept their premise. They say "this is wrong because AI won't be able to meaningfully write code" rather than "this is wrong because when AI<!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 64 --> <!-- /react-text --><span data-reactid="65">can</span><!-- react-text: 66 --> meaningfully write code, far from making Software Engineers obsolete, it will help them".<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="67">The reason I'd expect more Software Engineers to hold the latter view is because there's really nothing new here. I guess using AI to produce code looks like some giant leap at first glance, but it's really more a linear progression of something that's been happening in the software industry since day one - using software to automate writing software. Tools and frameworks that improve efficiency in building software by automating more and more of the heavy lifting are something that every Software Engineer is familiar with, and it's understood that they're unequivocally a good thing. Why should an AI writing code be any different?</p><p data-reactid="68">Furthermore, it's established at this point that such tools do not lead to less need for Software Engineers, because there is not a fixed limit of demand for software to be built. Rather, they allow more and better software to be built faster, opening new opportunities to apply software solutions where they weren't previously economical, growing the software industry and actually increasing the value of the skillset needed to build software, which again, is not the same thing as the ability to write code.</p><p data-reactid="70">Software Engineers should welcome every advancement that brings forward AI tools that assist in writing larger and more meaningful parts of our code. This isn't something to resist, but something to push forward, because far from making Software Engineers obsolete, these tools will further leverage the skills they have that are most valuable.</p><p data-reactid="71">And come on, who likes typing anyway?</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

There was a <strong>XML Parsing Error</strong> for <a href="https://cri.dev/rss.xml">cri.dev/rss.xml</a>.</p>
<p>ASAP after work I checked the validity through <a href="https://validator.w3.org/feed/">validator.w3.org/feed/</a> and in fact there were some issues with it.</p>
<p>Apparently a <strong>mismatched tag</strong> <code>&lt;/link&gt;</code> was causing the parser to go berserk.</p>
<p><img src="https://cri.dev/assets/images/posts/w3-feed-validator.png" alt="w3-feed-validator.png">
After understanding the issue, I simplified the <code>rss.md</code> (which generates the <a href="https://github.com/christian-fei/christian-fei.github.io/blob/master/rss.md"><code>rss.xml</code></a> through <a href="https://cri.dev/posts/2020-04-19-devblog-yet-another-static-site-generator-seriously/">devblog</a>) and used <a href="http://scripting.com/rss.xml">scripting.com/rss.xml</a> as an example.</p>
<p>Stripped away all the tags I didn't need, and this is the resulting version of <a href="https://github.com/christian-fei/christian-fei.github.io/blob/master/rss.md"><code>rss.md</code></a>:</p>

<p>The <code>reverse</code> nunjucks filter is needed because files are listed in alphabetical order, which means I would have the <em>oldest</em> post first otherwise.</p>
<h2>Validating the RSS feed in the CI</h2>
<p>I wanted to add this build step in the Continuous Integration I have set up with a GitHub Actions workflow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the validation of the RSS feed fails, the CI <strong>should not deploy a new version</strong> of the blog to <a href="https://cri.dev/">cri.dev</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking on NPM I found this little gem (pun intended) called <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/feed-validator"><code>feed-validator</code></a>.</p>
<p>Which I use in my <a href="https://github.com/christian-fei/christian-fei.github.io/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml">GitHub Actions workflow's main.yml</a> in the following way:</p>
<pre><code>...
      - name: build
        run: |
          npm run build
          npm run compress
      - name: start server
        run: |
           npm start &amp;
      - name: rss validation

          npm run deploy-with-assets
...
</code></pre>
<p>You could also run it via file with the <code>[-c FILE_PATH]</code> option.</p>
<p>This small module calls the <strong>validation endpoint on validator.w3.org</strong> for me. In other words, this could be done with a <code>cURL</code> call, but that's for another time.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I'd done everything right, yet it was 2 am and I still couldn't sleep. I had meditated for 30 minutes before I went to bed. I even took a couple of melatonin pills right after to be sure. Yet, here I was wide awake dreading how exhausted I would be the next day at work.</p><p>My problem wasn't unique. In America, one in every 10 adults will experience chronic insomnia<sup><a href="#references">1</a></sup>. It takes just one poor night of sleep to devolve into long term sleeping problems. This is because the majority of sleeping problems stem from anxiety and worry<sup><a href="#references">2</a></sup>. <b>The more you worry about not getting enough sleep, the worse your sleep gets</b>.</p><p>For me, my sleeping issues began right out of college. I had started a job as a software engineer and I was starting to feel the pressure. I had a couple of big deadlines coming up and I found myself tossing and turning unable to sleep one night. My mind kept racing, thinking about all the work I had until I finally fell asleep.</p><p>I thought that was it — an abnormal night, but then it happened again. This time, my outlook changed. I started worrying about how not getting enough sleep would affect my day. I looked up basic sleep hygiene tips online and decided to go to bed extra early to make sure I made up for lost sleep. This ended up backfiring and it took a few hours before I could finally sleep.</p><p>At this point, my sleeping struggles started becoming more regular. I downloaded a couple of meditation apps in the hopes that meditating and listening to soothing sounds would help me sleep better. I even resorted to over the counter sleeping aids on nights when it took me too long to fall asleep. <b>The results were mixed — I'd fall asleep faster but over time I'd revert back to having poor sleep</b>.</p><p>I finally caved and decided to try prescription medication. I had read a lot about them and was very reluctant because of their long term side effects. On a visit to my doctor, I asked her if she could prescribe me something to help me sleep. She said she said she could, but it wasn't going to be medication. Instead, she put in a referral to a CBT-I (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia) therapist.</p><p>CBT-I is an evidence-based (proven in clinical trials) technique used to treat sleep problems<sup><a href="#references">3</a></sup>. <b>Two driving forces induce sleep — sleep drive &amp; mental arousal</b>. Your sleep drive is how sleepy/tired you feel when going to bed. Your mental arousal is the racing thoughts and alertness you feel when you go to bed. When your sleep drive is high and your arousal levels are low; it is easier to fall asleep. CBT-I prescribes a sleep schedule that ensures you have a high sleep drive. It also teaches you techniques to worry less and reduce your arousal.</p><p><b>CBT-I is extremely effective in treating sleeping problems</b>. Clinical trials have shown that 80% of people that follow a good CBT-I program will have normal sleep by the end<sup><a href="#references">4</a></sup>. The results are also permanent, unlike sleeping aids which are effective only as long as you are taking them<sup><a href="#references">5</a></sup>.</p><p>There were three main rules that I had to follow -</p><ol><li><p>I could only sleep within the sleep window my therapist prescribed. This ensured that I only went to bed when my sleep drive was high.</p></li><li><p>Every time I couldn't sleep, I had to make sure I didn't stay in bed for over 20 minutes. This way, I would subconsciously re-train my mind to not associate my bed with wakefulness<sup><a href="#references">6</a></sup>.</p></li><li><p>No day time naps and no caffeine after 2pm.</p></li></ol><div><p>I was sleeping around 5 hours at the time, so we set a 6 hour window within which I could sleep (1am - 7am in my case). I kept a log of how long it took me to sleep, how long I was awake in the middle of the night and how long I slept. This data was recorded to the closest 15th minute and is self reported. At the end of each week, my therapist would alter my sleep schedule based on the previous week's data.<b> Note:</b> Time awake is the time it took me to fall asleep + my night time awakenings
</p></div><p>
At the end of week 1, I was sleeping about the same as I was before. My time awake at night though had fallen by an hour. I was falling asleep faster and I was having less interrupted sleep. We decided to stick to the same sleep schedule for week 2.
</p><p>
At the end of this week, my sleep had increased and I was consistently awake for less than an hour. We decided to expand my window by 15 minutes for week 3.
</p><p>
We followed the same rules and either expanded or kept the same sleeping window for the next few weeks.
</p><p><b>At the end of the 10 week program, I was sleeping over 7 hours a night</b>. More importantly, I wasn't spending my days worrying about my sleep.
</p><p><b>CBT-I isn't an easy solution</b>. The sleep schedules are hard to follow and the results aren't instantaneous. It takes time and effort but the reward of permanently improved sleep is well worth it. Let me know if you do decide to try it and if it helps you improve your sleep. Here's to hoping you get better sleep soon.</p><p>If you'd like to know more about CBTI and other behavioral therapy techniques to improve sleep, check out our <a href="https://www.sleepedy.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">website</a>!</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><ol><li><p><a href="http://sleepeducation.org/news/2014/03/10/insomnia-awareness-day-facts-and-stats" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Insomnia Awareness Day by the American Association of Sleep Medicine</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/related-illnesses/sleep-disorders" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sleep Disorders by the Anxiety and Depression Association of America</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.sleepedy.com/cbt-for-insomnia" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CBT for Insomnia: A comprehensive guide</a></p></li><li><p>Trauer, James M. et al. “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26054060" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Chronic Insomnia: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.</a> Ann Intern Med.

              <!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Data augmentation is a technique to increase the variation in a dataset by applying transformations to the original data. It is often used when the training data is limited and as a way of preventing overfitting.<br>
Data augmentation is usually done on the fly when training a model. While it can be done, it is usually not practical to store the augmented data on disk. After all, we want to vary the augmented data every time it is shown to the model!</p>
<p>In Keras, there's an easy way to do data augmentation with the class <code>tensorflow.keras.image.preprocessing.ImageDataGenerator</code>. It allows you to specify the augmentation parameters, which we will go over in the next steps. For more details, have a look at the <a href="https://keras.io/api/preprocessing/image/#imagedatagenerator-class">Keras documentation for the ImageDataGenerator class</a>.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>This would be a good point to look at the Colab notebook. You can follow the tutorial by running the code in an ipython notebook on Colab for free, with zero setup! This allows you to play around with the parameters and explore what we discuss here in more detail.<br>
Click the link on the top of the post to either open the notebook in Google Colab or download it to run on your machine.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>First we will need some setup code. We start by importing <code>ImageDataGenerator</code> and util functions to load the data.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><pre><code>import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import load_img, img_to_array
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import requests
</code></pre><p>Next we download a sample image from the Github repository, save it locally and load it into memory. And we display the image as a reference of what our input is before data augmentation.</p><pre><code>url = 'https://github.com/dufourpascal/stepupai/raw/master/tutorials/data_augmentation/image.jpg'
r = requests.get(url, allow_redirects=True)
open('image.jpg', 'wb').write(r.content)

image = load_img('image.jpg')
image = img_to_array(image).astype(int)
data = np.expand_dims(image, 0)
plt.axis('off')
plt.imshow(data[0])</code></pre><figure><img src="https://stepup.ai/content/images/2020/07/sample_original-1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Our original input image, the lovely Caracara from Patagonia!</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>For ease of use, we define a function that initializes and returns an <code>ImageDataGenerator</code> object that we will then use to set the specific parameters when we visualize the augmentation.<br>
The <code>fil_mode</code> is set to 'nearest' by default, but for the visualizations in this tutorial we set them to a constant black value. You can set different behaviour by specifying <code>fill_mode</code> to one of <code>{'constant', 'nearest', 'reflect', 'wrap'}</code></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><pre><code>def default_datagen():
  datagen = ImageDataGenerator( fill_mode='constant', dtype=int)
  datagen.fit(data)
  return datagen</code></pre><p>Next we define a plot function that will take an <code>ImageDataGenerator</code> object and a dataset as input. This function will display a number of augmented images in a grid. Here we see the basic use of the data augmentation pipeline. Calling <code>datagen.flow(data)</code> returns a python generator that returns augmented images. Here we use that generator to get a new augmented image by using <code>next()</code>. We then plot the augmented image and move on to the next one. By default a single row and of five images is plotted, but this can be changed to see more augmented images.</p><pre><code>def plot_augmentation(datagen, data, n_rows=1, n_cols=5):
  n_images = n_rows * n_cols
  gen_flow = datagen.flow(data)

  plt.figure(figsize=(n_cols*4, n_rows*3))
  for image_index in range(n_images):
    image = next(gen_flow)
    plt.subplot(n_rows, n_cols, image_index+1)
    plt.axis('off')
    plt.imshow(image[0], vmin=0, vmax=255)</code></pre><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Now let's visualize the different transformations available in Keras! In each step, we will initialize a default <code>ImageDataGenerator</code> object, then set the augmentation parameters we are interested in, and finally visualize the result.</p>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure><img src="https://stepup.ai/content/images/2020/07/figures_augmentation.shift-4.png" alt="height_shift_range and width_shift_range"></figure><pre><code>datagen = default_datagen()
datagen.width_shift_range = 0.2
datagen.height_shift_range = 0.2
plot_augmentation(datagen, data)</code></pre><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Shifting an image left and right or up and down can be achieved by using the parameters <code>width_shift_range</code> and <code>height_shift_range</code>.</p>

plot_augmentation(datagen, data)</code></pre><p><code>zoom_range</code> allows the specification of the random zoom range as a tuple/list of two values <code>[lower, upper]</code>. The value specifies how much the image gets larger or smaller, e.g. a value of 1.0 means no zoom, a value of 0.5 would mean zoomed out so the image is only 50% as large as the input, and a value of 2.0 would mean zoomed in at 200%.

<p>As you can see, we can create an impressive set of variation from just a single sample image. And data augmentation in Keras can be done in a just few lines of code. For standard image classification tasks, this is often sufficent to start and can be used right out of the box.</p>
<h3 id="next">Next</h3>
<p>What I personally would like to see is an option to vary the colors, but this cannot be done out of the box with Keras. For that we have to implement it ourselves: Check out the next tutorial in the seris where we implement our own augmentation transformation!</p>

<p>After playing around with the new tool from OpenAI, named GPT-3, it’s clear that we’ve probably reached an inflection point in the progress of artificial intelligence.&nbsp; To think of it in more commonplace terms, parents will often have the interesting experience of watching their children suddenly gain competency in a skill, seemingly overnight.&nbsp; There will be lots of struggle and failed starts and then as if all in one moment, boom, suddenly the kid can do something new.&nbsp; GPT-3 hails a moment when machine learning got turned on and suddenly it could do an amazing new trick, and it does this new trick with astonishing coherence and ability.&nbsp; The hope of this episode is to present a description of what GPT-3 is in layman’s terms and then explore some possible ways that this could be used, and how it might impact society.</p>


<p>But first, what is GPT?&nbsp; The acronym stands for Generative Pretrained Transformer.&nbsp; Ok sure, but what exactly is it?&nbsp; How do we interact with it?&nbsp; In simple terms <em>it’s a program that accepts some text and then generates a continuation of this text.</em>&nbsp; What exactly does this look like?&nbsp; For those with access to the GPT-3 playground through OpenAI, it just looks like an empty textbox with a submit button.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now enters a principle that has emerged during the last week as developers have played around with it:</p>

<p><em>Garbage in, Garbage out.</em></p>

<p>GPT-3 mimics the style, tone and character of whatever text you feed it.&nbsp; (For those curious, you can hit the submit button with an empty textbox and GPT-3 will generate something.&nbsp; The first time I did this it started talking in French about libraries.&nbsp; The second time it started talking about heatwaves being in the headlines.)&nbsp; There is a bit of an art to the prompt you give GPT-3.&nbsp; Again, garbage in, garbage out.</p>


<p>Here are two examples:</p>


<p>Input: What’s up?</p>

<p>GPT-3 continuation: <em>A confused voice came from inside. When I opened the door, the person that looked back at me was Hayama Hayato. Why was Hayama, who I only shared memories of me playing soccer with, in my room at this hour of the night? That question immediately flew out from my mouth.</em></p>


<p>Second example, same exact input:</p>

<p>Input: What’s up?</p>

<p>GPT-3 continuation:&nbsp; <em>they respond 'Super' – at least they were back in the days of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully. I love the little sixties touches too, the poodle skirts, the VWs, the hippydom.</em><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<p>The input of “what’s up?” doesn’t provide any context, so GPT-3 generates text in a random direction each time. But notice how coherent it was…</p>

<p>But if you provide GPT-3 with context, say, the first couple paragraphs of an episode from Tinkered Thinking and it will generate a continuation of that episode which is shockingly on point and very believable.&nbsp; Episode <a target="_blank" href="https://tinkeredthinking.com/index.php?id=836">823</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://tinkeredthinking.com/index.php?id=837">824</a> are non-fiction episodes that explore just this idea.&nbsp; About half of each episode was <em>generated</em> by GPT-3.&nbsp; This collaboration was also done for <a target="_blank" href="https://tinkeredthinking.com/index.php?id=837">Episode 826</a> which is a fictional short story.&nbsp; GPT-3’s contribution to that episode is not explicitly indicated but there too it wrote approximately half of the text, and that episode in particular demonstrates an aspect of context in relationship to GPT-3.&nbsp; The program’s initial contributions to the fictional short story are a bit clunky.&nbsp; But as the story goes on, GPT-3’s contributions get <em>better and better </em>as the entire context of the story grows. &nbsp;</p>

<p>It should be obvious at this point that if you were to do something nefarious like input some dangerous ideas into GPT-3, then it would continue in the same vein.&nbsp; This is an important point that lends to obvious criticism and it’s a topic of which OpenAI is extremely conscious.&nbsp; The use of GPT-3 in the wild requires a security application among other safeguards to limit GPT-3’s use in obviously negative ways.&nbsp; Again, the principle holds: <em>garbage in, garbage out.&nbsp; </em>That holds not just for level of composition but of course, also subject matter.</p>

<p>Now how exactly does this magic work?&nbsp; To answer this, it’s necessary to wrap one’s mind around machine learning.&nbsp; How exactly does a machine learn?&nbsp; To be honest, nobody really knows.&nbsp; In a way, we’ve created a black box that can learn to figure things out.&nbsp; To really answer the question: how exactly does a machine learn is similar to asking: how does a person arise from all the chatter between neurons in a person’s brain?&nbsp; No one can answer that question.&nbsp; And likewise, no one can really answer the question about what’s really going on when a neural net is being trained in a machine learning context.&nbsp; That being said, we can describe some aspects of the process that help us grasp a sense of what’s going on.</p>

<p>Turns out, Machine Learning doesn’t seem too much different than human learning, though the differences are enormous and enormously important.&nbsp; Our brains are vast networks of neurons and they all talk to each other and somehow from all that chatter, we as individuals, emerge.&nbsp; To be sure, our understanding of the brain is still rudimentary, but it’s clear that neurons ‘listen’ to the chatter around them via a web of arms or dendrites that reach out to other neurons, and based on the signals they hear, they fire their own signal to be heard by another neuron or set of neurons.&nbsp; Multiply that process roughly 86 billion times, give it the right shape, and some configuration and boom, you have a human brain that will try to figure things out.&nbsp; (To dive a little deeper it’s useful to know that an infant actually has around 100 billion neurons, and as we learn how to exist in the world, we pare down this number significantly.)</p>

<p>GPT-3 was trained to generate text using a computational model that bares a lot of similarity to our jumble of neurons we call a brain.&nbsp; The analogy is so close in fact that this computational model is referred to as a ‘neural net’.&nbsp; Now here’s an interesting fact about GPT-3:&nbsp; the neural net upon which it was trained contains 175 billion parameters, or what you might think of as neurons.&nbsp; But there’s a distinction here we need to be very careful about.&nbsp; The node, or neuron, or what’s often referred to as a ‘parameter’ within this neural net is not a neuron in the same way that our neurons are.&nbsp; There is a similarity, but our neurons are vastly more complex than the nodes that exist within a neural net.&nbsp; Within the context of machine learning, a neuron is a fairly simple weighted value.&nbsp; These values dictate how one node talks to another.&nbsp; An actual human neuron is far more complex regarding how it listens and signals it’s neighbors.&nbsp; We must also take into account that there are many different types of neurons in the human brain specializing in different ways with different functions.&nbsp; Human neurons also have varying numbers of dendrites which are used to listen to other neurons.&nbsp; A single neuron can have over 100 dendrites and each dendrite has characteristics that determine how and what the core neuron hears and ultimately what sort of signal it sends.&nbsp; This presents a level of complexity that far exceeds what is going on with the nodes or neurons in a machine learning context.&nbsp; And this difference in complexity should make it intuitive why GPT-3 was trained using so many ‘neurons’.&nbsp; It’s construction and organization of these ‘neurons’ is far simpler and more straightforward than what we have going on between our ears, so where the neural net lacks in terms of shape and initial configuration, it attempts to make up for in size and the brute force achieved by speed and computational iteration.</p>

<p>So how does a neural net learn in order for something like GPT-3 to work?&nbsp; First you need a gargantuan amount of data.&nbsp; GPT-3 was trained using text from the internet - an amount of text that is just inconceivable for a single human being to think about reading.&nbsp; Think of every comment, every post, every description, every pdf book freely available, all the tweets and blogs, manuals, dissertations, threads, rantings - all of it.&nbsp; That was the block of text that was given to the neural net for it’s training. &nbsp;</p>

<p>So how does that training work?&nbsp; Imagine I gave you a paragraph to read, but I left off the last word, and asked you to guess what that word is.&nbsp; As a human, you’d probably do really well at this.&nbsp; You’d certainly do a perfect job guessing a <em>sensible</em> word that fits the context and which works, regardless of whether you guess the actual word. Here’s a tiny example:&nbsp; Please provide the last word that should be added to the end of this ___________ . &nbsp;</p>

<p>The above example is easy.&nbsp; The word is ‘sentence’.&nbsp; But.&nbsp; Since I’ve started a new paragraph, you could also plop the word ‘paragraph’ into the slot and it still works.&nbsp; This is the task that GPT-3 has become remarkably good at:&nbsp; <em>what word would make sense to come next?&nbsp; </em>The training of the neural net essentially asked this question of itself over and over.&nbsp; We can imagine the neural net reading 99 words and guessing what the 100th word would be.&nbsp; It would then check the answer and see how far ‘off’ the answer was, and based on the difference it would backtrack through the neural net to find all of the nodes that were most responsible for the choice of the wrong word, and then it would adjust the weights of those nodes, which in turn effects how those nodes will talk to one another in the next round.&nbsp; Run this game an astronomical number of times with an inconceivably large amount of text and after a while the neural net gets pretty good at the game it’s playing. &nbsp;</p>

<p>What’s important to note is that the computer is not actually ‘reading’ the text that’s given to it.&nbsp; The computer first creates embeddings for this block of text.&nbsp; What is an embedding?&nbsp; It’s arbitrary, but it’s a form that the computer can actually work with.&nbsp; Computers function using binary code.&nbsp; Each letter that you read on a website is actually derived from a binary code.&nbsp; So embeddings are bits of binary code that are associated with the words and word-snippets that the computer ‘reads’.&nbsp; These embeddings …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I was browsing <a href="https://whitepages.com/">Whitepages</a> when I noticed a request to <a href="https://www.whitepages.com/dstl-wp.js">https://www.whitepages.com/dstl-wp.js</a>[1].  After beautifying the code, I found the string “Distil” in the code many times.  “Distil” refers to Distil Networks, one of the leading bot detection vendors until its acquisition by Imperva in 2019.  Whitepages seems to use them for their anti-scraping abilities.</p>

<h2 id="the-code">The Code</h2>
<h3 id="fingerprinting">Fingerprinting</h3>

<p>The first part of the code is the fingerprinting module.  This code is not really obfuscated, just minified (unlike the headless detection code later).  It collects a bunch of information from the browser using (mostly) standard techniques.  <a href="https://www.imperva.com/blog/the-evolution-of-hi-def-fingerprinting-in-bot-mitigation/">According to Imperva</a>, their “Hi-def” fingerprints encompass over 200 device attributes and have a 0% false positive rate.  The fingerprinting code appears to be based off Valve’s <a href="https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs2/blob/master/fingerprint2.js">fingerprintjs2</a> (identical function names and contents in many cases), albeit with some additions.</p>

<p>This code collects (via JavaScript):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>* Browser User-Agent - navigator.userAgent
* Browser language - navigator.language
* System language (IE only) - navigator.systemLanguage
* User language (IE only) - navigator.userLanguage
* Screen resolution - screen.width/screen.height
* Timezone offset in hours - (new Date).getTimezoneOffset() / -60
* IndexedDB support - !!window.indexedDB
* HTMLElement addBehavior support (IE only) - !!document.body.addBehavior
* WebSQL support - !!window.openDatabase
* CPU Class (IE and Firefox only) - navigator.cpuClass || navigator.oscpu
* Browser platform - navigator.platform
* Do Not Track support - navigator.doNotTrack
* Browser plugins (non IE) - navigator.plugins enumeration
* ActiveX plugins (IE only) - trying/catching creating ActiveXObjects with names from a list of popular plugins
* Canvas fingerprinting - standard method.  Creating a Canvas element, drawing some rectangles and arcs on it, along with the string "Cwm fjordbank glyphs vext quiz,", then getting the base64 PNG representation via toDataURL and hashing it
* Font detection - using a method popularized by [Lalit Patel](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/szepeviktor/d28dfcfc889fe61763f3/raw/6bbcda9766e65fd81e951400e0ceca03c14b6fad/fontdetect.js).  Essentially, they measure the dimensions of the browsers default (fallback) monospace, sans-serif, and serif fonts.  They then measure the dimensions of a large list of fonts.  If there is a difference in dimensions between a font in the list and the fallback font, the font is installed.
* Video codec detection - creating a new video element and checking whether video.canPlayType() returns true for various codecs, including video/ogg; codecs="theora" (Theora with OGG), video/mp4; codecs="avc1.42E01E (H264 MP4), video/webm; codecs="vp8, vorbis" (WEBM).
* Audio codec detection - creating an audio element and checking whether audio.canPlayType returns true for audio/ogg; codecs="vorbis" (OGG Vorbis), audio/mpeg; (MP3), audio/wav; codecs="1" (WAV), audio/x-m4a; (M4A), audio/aac; (AAC)
* WebGL fingerprinting - Creates a Canvas element with a WebGL context.  Then draws a gradient object with shaders and gets the base64 string with toDataURL.  They then check for the system's max texture anisotropy.  After that, they gather GPU vendor and renderer information with the WEBGL_debug_renderer_info extension.
* Touch support - navigator.maxTouchPoints || navigator.msMaxTouchPoints and attempting to create a TouchEvent handler (if it's successful then touch is supported)
* Browser vendor - navigator.vendor
* Browser product (should always be equal to "Gecko", even on Chrome based browsers) - navigator.product
* Browser build number - navigator.productSub
* Internet explorer detection through parsing navigator.appName
* Chrome detection (worth noting that this tends to be defined on most Chromium derivatives, including Microsoft Edge) - presence of window.chrome
* Webdriver support (the [W3C specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#example-1) declares that tools implementing the Webdriver browser automation standard should declare navigator.webdriver as true) - presence of navigator.webdriver
* Current URL protocol - document.location.protocol
* Session history length - window.history.length
* CPU core count - navigator.hardwareConcurrency
* Battery interface support - presence of navigator.getBattery
* Media device (webcams, microphones, speakers) enumeration - navigator.mediaDevices
* Cookie support - navigator.cookieEnabled
* Browser appName (always "Netscape" on modern browsers) - navigator.appName
* Screen Color Depth - screen.colorDepth
* String representation of setTimeout function (used to detect tampering, it should return function setTimeout() { [native code] } but if a wrapper is being used it will return something different) - setTimeout.toString()
* String representation of setInterval function (same reasoning as above) - setInterval.toString()
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="proof-of-work">Proof of Work</h3>

<p>After collecting all of this information, Distil then runs its “proof of work.”  Similar to the Cloudflare Under Attack mode, your browser basically generates some sort of token using JavaScript that the server then checks and (hopefully) ensures it was generated with the JavaScript.  Distil’s “proof of work” seems to just be generating random alphanumeric characters and doing some basic math calculations with them.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>function t(e) {
  for (var t = "0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", r = "", n = 0; e &gt; n; ++n) r += t.substr(Math.floor(Math.random() * t.length), 1);
  return r;
}
h("DistilProofOfWorkStart");
var r = new o, n = (new Date).getTime() + ":" + t(20);
r.mine(n, 8, function (t) {
  h("DistilProofOfWorkStop"), e({proof: t});
});

...

mine: function(e, t, r) {
    for (var i = 0, a = Math.pow(2, 32 - t);;) {
        var o = i.toString(16) + ":" + e;
        i++;
        var s = n(o);
        if (parseInt(s.substr(0, 8), 16) &lt; a) return void r(o)
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="browser-automation-testing">Browser Automation Testing</h3>
<p>Following the proof of work, the automated/headless browser detection code is run.  This code is obfuscated.  The first thing I noticed was that there was a large array of strings represented with hexadecimal escaping.  This is a technique most commonly used by <a href="https://obfuscator.io/">obfuscator.io</a>.  This makes it very hard to read – <code>_0x159[54]</code> is much harder to read than “document.”  To undo this obfuscation, I used Jarrod Overson’s great <a href="https://github.com/jsoverson/shift-refactor">shift-refactor</a> library.  It uses Shape Security’s Shift AST to allow you to parse and manipulate JavaScript.  To replace all member expressions (i.e. arr[1]) with their string values, I used the following code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>const { RefactorSession } = require('shift-refactor');
const { parseScript } = require('shift-parser');
const Shift = require('shift-ast');

const fileContents = require('fs').readFileSync('./distillnetworks.js', 'utf8');

const tree = parseScript(fileContents);

const refactor = new RefactorSession(tree);

refactor.replace(
  `ComputedMemberExpression[expression.type="LiteralNumericExpression"][object.type="IdentifierExpression"]`,

  node =&gt; {
    var referencedArrayName = node.object.name;
    var arrayQuery = `VariableDeclarator[binding.name="` + referencedArrayName + `"][init.type="ArrayExpression"]`;
    var referencedArrayDeclaration = refactor.query(arrayQuery)[0];
    if (!referencedArrayDeclaration) {
      return node;
    }
    if (referencedArrayDeclaration.init.elements[node.expression.value].type !== "LiteralStringExpression") { // if we're working with a non string, return
      return node;
    }
    var newValue = referencedArrayDeclaration.init.elements[node.expression.value].value;
    if (!newValue) {
      return node;
    }
    else {
      return new Shift.LiteralStringExpression({
        value: newValue,
      });      
    }
  }
);
console.log("/* Replaced all array references with real value */")

console.log(refactor.print());
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Essentially, we find all of the member expressions (<code>ComputedMemberExpression</code>) that index the array (the <code>IdentifierExpression</code> – though this can refer to any variable) using an integer (<code>LiteralNumericExpression</code>).  We then find the array that is being indexed (searching for the <code>VariableDeclarator</code> of type <code>ArrayExpression</code> with the same name as the referenced variable), get the actual value, make sure it is a string, and then return it if so.  Otherwise, we return the original <code>node</code>.  After running this (<code>node distillnetworks_deobfuscator.js &gt; distillnetworks_deobfuscated.js</code>), readability has massively increased, but there is still much to be desired.</p>

<p>I then noticed one more annoyance.  There was a function, <code>_0x9e50x4</code>, that, if passed “O” as an argument, would return <code>["Snow Leopard", "Lion/Mountain Lion", "Yosemite", "Mavericks"]</code>.  Otherwise, it would return <code>[]</code>.  These strings themselves are not actually used in the code, but their substrings are actually used to assemble other strings.  To replace the <code>_0x9e50x4</code> calls with their real values, I added the following code above the <code>refactor.print</code> call.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>var _0x9e50x4List = ["Snow Leopard", "Lion/Mountain Lion", "Yosemite", "Mavericks"];
refactor.replaceRecursive(
  `CallExpression[callee.name="_0x9e50x4"][callee.type="IdentifierExpression"]`,

  node =&gt; {
    if (node.arguments.value="O") {
      var newArray = new Shift.ArrayExpression({elements: []});
      for (var i = 0; i &lt; _0x9e50x4List.length; ++i) {
        newArray.elements.push(new Shift.LiteralStringExpression({value: _0x9e50x4List[i]}));
      }
      return newArray;
    }
    else {
      return new Shift.ArrayExpression({
        elements: [],
      })
    }
    return node;
  }
);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, there was another thing that was hurting my eyes.  <code>_0x9e50x1</code> was being referenced instead of <code>window</code>.  To increase readability, I added another <code>refactor.replace</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>var windowObjectName = "_0x9e50x1";
refactor.replace(
  `IdentifierExpression[name="` + windowObjectName + `"]`,

  node =&gt; {
    return new Shift.IdentifierExpression({
      name: "window",
    })
  }
);
console.log("/* Done renaming " + windowObjectName + " …</code></pre></div></div></article></div>

Communication between different researchers and research groups becomes increasingly important. A key challenge for communication arises from inconsistent notation usages among different papers. This proposal suggests a standard for commonly used mathematical notation for machine learning. In this first version, only some notation are mentioned and more notation are left to be done. This proposal will be regularly updated based on the progress of the field.</p><p>You can use this notation by downloading LaTeX macro package <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/mlmath">MLMath.sty</a> tuned for the updates and you can turn to <a href="https://github.com/Mayuyu/suggested-notation-for-machine-learning">GitHub</a> for more information.</p></div></div><div><h3>Notation Table</h3><p>See the full <a href="https://2020-assets.baai.ac.cn/sign/img/ml_notation.pdf" target="_blank">Guide</a> for more</p><ul><li>\(S=\{\mathbf{z}_i\}_{i=1}^n=\{(\mathbf{x}_i,\mathbf{y}_i)\}_{i=1}^n\)</li><li>Dataset</li><li>\(\mathcal{H}\)</li><li>function space</li><li>\(f_{\mathbf{\theta}}:\mathcal{X}\to \mathcal{Y}\)</li><li>hypothesis function</li><li>\(L_{S}(\mathbf{\theta}), L_{n}(\mathbf{\theta}), R_{n}(\mathbf{\theta}), R_{S}(\mathbf{\theta})\)</li><li>empirical risk or training loss</li><li>\(f(\mathbf{x};\mathbf{\theta})=\sum_{j=1}^{m} a_j \sigma (\mathbf{w}_j\cdot \mathbf{x} + b_j) \)</li><li>two-layer neural network</li><li>\({\rm Rad}_{n} (\mathcal{H})\)</li><li>Rademacher complexity</li><li>GD</li><li>gradient descent</li><li>SGD</li><li>stochastic gradient descent</li><li>\(B\)</li><li>a batch set</li><li>\(|B|\)</li><li>batch size</li><li>\(\eta\)</li><li>learning rate</li><li>\(\mathbf{\xi}\)</li><li>continuous frequency</li></ul></div><div><h3>Notation Table</h3><p>See the full <a href="https://2020-assets.baai.ac.cn/sign/img/ml_notation.pdf" target="_blank">Guide</a> for more</p><table><thead><tr><th>symbol</th><th>meaning</th><th>LATEX</th><th>simplied</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th>x</th><th>input</th><th>\bm{x}</th><th>\vx</th></tr><tr><th>y</th><th>output, label</th><th>\bm{y}</th><th>\vy</th></tr><tr><th>d</th><th>input dimension</th><th>d</th><th></th></tr><tr><th>do</th><th>output dimension d_{\rm o}</th><th>d_{\rm o}</th><th></th></tr><tr><th>n</th><th>number of samples</th><th>n</th><th></th></tr><tr><th>X</th><th>instances domain (a set)</th><th>\mathcal{X}</th><th>\fX</th></tr><tr><th>Y</th><th>labels domain (a set)</th><th>\mathcal{Y}</th><th>\fY</th></tr><tr><th>Z</th><th>= X × Y example domain</th><th>\mathcal{Z}</th><th>\fZ</th></tr><tr><th>H</th><th>hypothesis space (a set)</th><th>\mathcal{H}</th><th>\fH</th></tr><tr><th>θ</th><th>a set of parameters</th><th>\bm{\theta}</th><th>\vtheta</th></tr><tr><th>fθ : X → Y</th><th>hypothesis function</th><th>\f_{\bm{\theta}}</th><th>f_{\vtheta}</th></tr><tr><th>f or f ∗ : X → Y</th><th>target function</th><th>f,f^*</th><th></th></tr><tr><th>ℓ : H × Z → R+</th><th>loss function</th><th>\ell</th><th></th></tr><tr><th>D</th><th>distribution of Z</th><th>\mathcal{D}</th><th>\fD</th></tr><tr><th>S = {zi}ni=1</th><th>= {(xi, yi)}ni=1 sample set</th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><th>LS(θ), Ln(θ),</th><th>empirical risk or training loss</th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><th>Rn(θ), RS(θ)</th><th>empirical risk or training loss</th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><th>LD(θ), RD(θ)</th><th>population risk or expected loss</th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><th>σ : R → R+</th><th>activation function</th><th>\sigma</th><th></th></tr><tr><th>wj</th><th>input weight</th><th>\bm{w}_j</th><th>\vw_j</th></tr><tr><th>aj</th><th>output weight</th><th>a_j</th><th></th></tr><tr><th>bj</th><th>bias term</th><th>b_j</th><th></th></tr><tr><th>f∑θ(x) or f(x; θ)</th><th>neural network</th><th>f_{\bm{\theta}}</th><th>f_{\vtheta}</th></tr><tr><th>∑mj=1 ajσ(wj · x + bj )</th><th>two-layer neural network</th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><th>VCdim(H)</th><th>VC-dimension of H</th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><th>Rad(H ◦ S), RadS(H)</th><th>Rademacher complexity of H on S</th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><th>Radn(H)</th><th>Rademacher complexity over samples of size n</th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><th>GD</th><th>gradient descent</th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><th>SGD</th><th>stochastic gradient descent</th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><th>B</th><th>a batch set</th><th>B</th><th></th></tr><tr><th>|B|</th><th>batch size</th><th>b</th><th></th></tr><tr><th>η</th><th>learning rate</th><th>\eta</th><th></th></tr><tr><th>k</th><th>discretized frequency</th><th>\bm{k}</th><th>\vk</th></tr><tr><th>ξ</th><th>continuous frequency</th><th>\bm{\xi}</th><th>\vxi</th></tr><tr><th>∗</th><th>convolution operation</th><th>*</th><th></th></tr></tbody></table></div><div><h3>And a quick video that explains it</h3><p><video controls="controls"><source src="https://2020-assets.baai.ac.cn/sign/notation-live/en-20200708.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></p></div></div><!-- footer --></div>]]>

<h2>Abstract</h2><p>RISC-V has many attractions, ranging from the openness of the architecture, its clean-slate design based on simplicity and scalability, as well as the RISC-V Foundation's strong commitment to security from the ground up.

As such, RISC-V is an extremely attractive platform for the open-source seL4 microkernel with its unrivalled verification and security story. This has led industry players, especially Germany-based HENSOLDT Cyber, making a major bet on the combination of RISC-V and seL4, resulting in them funding the formal verification (implementation correctness proof) of seL4 on RISC-V.

I will discuss our experience with implementing and verifying seL4 on the RISC-V architecture, and related open-source technologies we are employing to allow us to build secure systems. This includes the CAmkES component framework that supports a security-by-architecture approach, and the Cogent systems language that is designed to reduce the cost of verified system components such as file systems and device drivers. 

One interesting aspect are timing channels. We have been working for a number of years on *time protection*, the temporal equivalent of memory protection, as a systematic timing-channel prevention. Our experience on x86 and ARM processors is that they lack the mechanisms to do this completely. RISC-V presents an opportunity to get this right, and I will report on my experience working with the RISC-V Foundation's Security Standing Committee to get the required mechanisms into the processor specification.
