<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">                                   
                    <p>Flu (influenza) and pneumonia vaccinations are associated with reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease, according to new research reported at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference® (AAIC®) 2020.</p>

<p>Three research studies reported at AAIC 2020 suggest:</p>

<ul>
<li>At least one flu vaccination was associated with a 17% reduction in Alzheimer's incidence. </li>
<li>More frequent flu vaccination was associated
with another 13% reduction in Alzheimer's incidence.</li>
<li>Vaccination against pneumonia between ages 65 and 75 reduced Alzheimer's risk by up to 40% depending on individual genes.</li>
<li>Individuals with dementia have a higher risk of dying (6-fold) after infections than those without dementia (3-fold).</li>
</ul>

<p>"With the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines are at the forefront of public health discussions. It is important to explore their benefit in not only protecting against viral or bacterial infection but also improving long-term health outcomes," said Maria C. Carrillo, Ph.D., Alzheimer's Association chief science officer.</p>

<p>"It may turn out to be as simple as if you're taking care of your health in this way — getting vaccinated — you're also taking care of yourself in other ways, and these things add up to lower risk of Alzheimer's and other dementias," Carrillo said. "This research, while early, calls for further studies in large, diverse clinical trials to inform whether vaccinations as a public health strategy decrease our risk for developing dementia as we age."</p>

<h2>Seasonal Flu Vaccine May Reduce Incidence of Alzheimer's Dementia</h2>

<p>Previous research has suggested vaccinations may have a protective factor against cognitive decline, but there have been no large, comprehensive studies focused on the influenza (flu) vaccine and Alzheimer's disease risk, specifically. To address this gap, Albert Amran, a medical student at McGovern Medical School at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, and team, investigated a large American health record dataset (n=9,066).</p>

<p>Amran and team found having one flu vaccination was associated with a lower prevalence of Alzheimer's (odds ratio 0.83, p&lt;0.0001), and among vaccinated patients receiving the flu vaccine more frequently was associated with an even lower prevalence of Alzheimer's (odds ratio 0.87, p=0.0342). Thus, people that consistently got their annual flu shot had a lower risk of Alzheimer's. This translated to an almost 6% reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease for patients between the ages of 75-84 for 16 years.</p>

<p>The researchers found the protective association between the flu vaccine and the risk of Alzheimer's was strongest for those who received their first vaccine at a younger age — for example, the people who received their first documented flu shot at age 60 benefited more than those who received their first flu shot at age 70.</p>

<p>"Our study suggests that regular use of a very accessible and relatively cheap intervention — the flu shot — may significantly reduce risk of Alzheimer's dementia," Amran said. "More research is needed to explore the biological mechanism for this effect — why and how it works in the body — which is important as we explore effective preventive therapies for Alzheimer's."</p>

<h2>Pneumonia Vaccine May Reduce Alzheimer's Risk later in life.</h2><p>
 Repurposing of existing vaccines may be a promising approach to Alzheimer's disease prevention. Svetlana Ukraintseva, Ph.D., Associate Research Professor in the Biodemography of Aging Research Unit (BARU) at Duke University Social Science Research Institute, and team, investigated associations between pneumococcal vaccination, with and without an accompanying seasonal flu shot, and the risk of Alzheimer's disease among 5,146 participants age 65+ from the Cardiovascular Health Study. The team also took into account a known genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's — the rs2075650 G allele in the TOMM40 gene.</p>

<p>The researchers found that pneumococcal vaccination between ages 65-75 reduced risk of developing Alzheimer's by 25-30% after adjusting for sex, race, birth cohort, education, smoking, and number of G alleles. The largest reduction in the risk of Alzheimer's (up to 40%) was observed among people vaccinated against pneumonia who were non-carriers of the risk gene. Total number of vaccinations against pneumonia and the flu between ages 65 and 75 was also associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer's; however, the effect was not evident for the flu shot alone.</p>

<p>"Vaccinations against pneumonia before age 75 may reduce Alzheimer's risk later in life, depending on individual genotype," Ukraintseva said. "These data suggest that pneumococcal vaccine may be a promising candidate for personalized Alzheimer's prevention, particularly in non-carriers of certain risk genes."</p>

<h2>Infection Substantially Increases Mortality in People with Dementia</h2>

<p>People living with dementia commonly experience other health conditions including viral, bacterial, and other infections. There is a growing trend in research to investigate whether infections might be worsening, more life-threatening or possibly causing dementia.</p>

<p>Janet Janbek, a Ph.D. student at the Danish Dementia Research Centre, Rigshospitalet and the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, and team, used data from national health registries to investigate mortality in Danish residents over age 65 (n=1,496,436) who had visited the hospital with an infection. They found that people with both dementia and such hospital visits died at a 6.5 times higher rate compared with people who had neither. Study participants with either dementia alone or infection-related contacts alone had a threefold increased rate. The rate of mortality was highest within the first 30 days following the hospital visit.</p>

<p>The researchers also found that for people living with dementia the mortality rates remained elevated for 10 years after the initial infection-related hospital visit, and mortality rates from all infections (including major infections like sepsis to minor ear infections) were higher compared with people without dementia or without an infection-related hospital visit.</p>

<p>"Our study supports the need to investigate these relations even further; to find out why infections are linked to higher mortality in people with dementia, specifically which risk factors and biological mechanisms are involved. This will help advance our understanding of the role of infections in dementia," said Janbek.</p>

<p>"Our study suggests that the health care system — as well as relatives of people with dementia — should have increased awareness of people with dementia who get infections, so they get the medical care they need. People with dementia require more specialized treatment even when their hospital visits are not directly due to their dementia but to what might appear to be an unrelated infection," Janbek added.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">


          

            <p>So <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13777">CVE-2020-13777</a> came out while I wasn't looking last week. The
GnuTLS advisory (<a href="https://gnutls.org/security-new.html#GNUTLS-SA-2020-06-03">GNUTLS-SA-2020-06-03</a>) is pretty opaque so I'll
refer instead to <a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile/status/1270061316368224256">this tweet</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile">@FiloSottile</a> (Go team
security lead):</p>

<blockquote><p>PSA: don't rely on GnuTLS, please.</p>

<p><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13777">CVE-2020-13777</a> Whoops, for the past 10 releases most TLS 1.0–1.2
connection could be passively decrypted and most TLS 1.3 connections
intercepted. Trivially.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="https://blog.filippo.io/we-need-to-talk-about-session-tickets/">TLS 1.2–1.0 session tickets are awful</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>You are reading this correctly: supposedly encrypted TLS connections
made with affected GnuTLS releases are vulnerable to <em>passive</em>
cleartext recovery attack (and active for 1.3, but who uses that
anyways). That is extremely bad. It's pretty close to just switching
everyone to HTTP instead of HTTPS, more or less. I would have a lot
more to say about the security of GnuTLS in particular -- and security
in general -- but I am mostly concerned about patching holes in the
roof right now, so this article is not about that.</p>

<p>This article is about figuring out what, exactly, was exposed in our
infrastructure because of this.</p>






<p>Assuming you're running Debian, this will show a list of packages that
<code>Depends</code> on GnuTLS:</p>

<pre><code>apt-cache --installed rdepends libgnutls30 | grep '^ ' | sort -u
</code></pre>

<p>This assumes you run this only on hosts running Buster or
above. Otherwise you'll need to figure out a way to pick machines
running GnuTLS 3.6.4 or later.</p>

<p>Note that this list only <em>first level</em> dependencies! It is perfectly
possible that another package uses GnuTLS without being listed
here. For example, in the above list I have <code>libcurl3-gnutls</code>, so the
be really thorough, I would actually need to recurse down the
dependency tree.</p>

<p>On my desktop, this shows an "interesting" list of targets:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>apt</code></li>
<li><code>cadaver</code> - AKA WebDAV</li>
<li><code>curl</code> &amp; <code>wget</code></li>
<li><code>fwupd</code> - another attack on top of <a href="https://github.com/justinsteven/advisories/blob/master/2020_fwupd_dangling_s3_bucket_and_CVE-2020-10759_signature_verification_bypass.md">this one</a></li>
<li><code>git</code> (through the <code>libcurl3-gnutls</code> dependency)</li>
<li><code>mutt</code> - all your emails</li>
<li><code>weechat</code> - your precious private chats</li>
</ul>


<p>Arguably, fetchers like <code>apt</code>, <code>curl</code>, <code>fwupd</code>, and <code>wget</code> rely on HTTPS for
"authentication" more than secrecy, although <code>apt</code> has its own
OpenPGP-based authentication so that wouldn't matter anyways. Still,
this is truly distressing. And I haven't mentioned here things like
<code>gobby</code>, <code>network-manager</code>, <code>systemd</code>, and others - the scope of this is
broad. Hell, even good old <code>lynx</code> links against GnuTLS.</p>

<p>In our infrastructure, the magic command looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>cumin -o txt -p 0  'F:lsbdistcodename=buster' "apt-cache --installed rdepends libgnutls30 | grep '^ ' | sort -u" | tee gnutls-rdepds-per-host | awk '{print $NF}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
</code></pre>

<p>There, the result is even more worrisome, as those important packages seem to rely on GnuTLS for their transport security:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>mariadb</code> - all MySQL traffic and passwords</li>
<li><code>mandos</code> - full disk encryption</li>
<li><code>slapd</code> - LDAP passwords</li>
</ul>


<p><code>mandos</code> is especially distressing although it's probably not
vulnerable because it seems it doesn't store the cleartext -- it's
encrypted with the client's OpenPGP public key -- so the TLS tunnel
never sees the cleartext either.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jedisct1/status/1270078914996682753">Other reports</a> have also mentioned the following servers link
against GnuTLS and could be vulnerable:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>exim</code></li>
<li><code>rsyslog</code></li>
<li><code>samba</code></li>
<li>various <code>VNC</code> implementations</li>
</ul>




<p>Those programs are not affected by this vulnerability:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>apache2</code></li>
<li><code>gnupg</code></li>
<li><code>python</code></li>
<li><code>nginx</code></li>
<li><code>openssh</code></li>
</ul>


<p>This list is not exhaustive, naturally, but serves as an example of
common software you don't need to worry about.</p>

<p>The vulnerability only exists in GnuTLS, as far as we know, so
programs linking against other libraries are not vulnerable.</p>

<p>Because the vulnerability affects session tickets -- and those are set
on the server side of the TLS connection -- only users of GnuTLS as a
server are vulnerable. This means, for example, that while <code>weechat</code>
uses GnuTLS, it will only suffer from the problem when acting as a
server (which it does, in relay mode) or, of course, if the remote IRC
server also uses GnuTLS. Same with apt, curl, wget, or git: it is
unlikely to be a problem because it is only used as a client; the
remote server is usually a webserver -- not git itself -- when using
TLS.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that it's not because a package links against GnuTLS that
it <em>uses</em> it. For example, I have been told that, on Arch Linux, if
both GnuTLS and OpenSSL are available, the <code>mutt</code> package will use the
latter, so it's not affected. I haven't confirmed that myself nor have I
checked on Debian.</p>

<p>Also, because it relies on session tickets, there's a time window
after which the ticket gets cycled and properly initialized. But that
is <a href="https://twitter.com/__agwa/status/1270054740559384576">apparently 6 hours by default</a> so it is going to protect only
really long-lasting TLS sessions, which are uncommon, I would argue.</p>

<p>My audit is limited. For example, it might have been better to walk
the shared library dependencies directly, instead of relying on Debian
package dependencies.</p>



<p>It seems the vulnerability might have been introduced in <a href="https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/merge_requests/695">this merge
request</a>, itself following a (entirely reasonable) <a href="https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/issues/184">feature request
to make it easier to rotate session tickets</a>. The merge request was
open for a few months and was thoroughly reviewed by a peer before
being merged. Interestingly, the vulnerable function
(<code>_gnutls_initialize_session_ticket_key_rotation</code>), explicitly says:</p>

<pre><code> * This function will not enable session ticket keys on the server side. That is done
 * with the gnutls_session_ticket_enable_server() function. This function just initializes
 * the internal state to support periodical rotation of the session ticket encryption key.
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, it thinks it is not responsible for session ticket
initialization, yet it is. Indeed, the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/merge_requests/1275/">merge request fixing the
problem</a> unconditionally does this:</p>

<pre><code>memcpy(session-&gt;key.initial_stek, key-&gt;data, key-&gt;size);
</code></pre>

<p>I haven't reviewed the code and the vulnerability in detail, so take
the above with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/merge_requests/1275.patch">full patch is available here</a>. See also the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/issues/1011">upstream issue
1011</a>, the <a href="https://gnutls.org/security-new.html#GNUTLS-SA-2020-06-03">upstream advisory</a>, the <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-13777">Debian security
tracker</a>,
and the <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1843723">Redhat Bugzilla</a>.</p>



<p>The impact of this vulnerability depends on the affected packages and
how they are used. It can range from "meh, someone knows I downloaded
that Debian package yesterday" to "holy crap my full disk encryption
passwords are compromised, I need to re-encrypt all my drives",
including "I need to change all LDAP and MySQL passwords".</p>

<p>It promises to be a fun week for some people at least.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, however, one has to wonder whether we should follow
<a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile">@FiloSottile</a>'s advice and stop using GnuTLS altogether. There are
at least a few programs that link against GnuTLS because of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSSL#Licensing">OpenSSL licensing oddities</a> but that has been first announced in
2015, then <a href="https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2017/03/22/license/">definitely and clearly resolved in 2017</a> -- or <a href="https://opensource.com/article/19/2/top-foss-legal-developments">maybe
that was in 2018</a>? Anyways it's fixed, pinky-promise-I-swear,
except if you're one of those weirdos still using GPL-2, of
course. Even though OpenSSL isn't the simplest and secure TLS
implementation out there, it could preferable to GnuTLS and maybe we
should consider changing Debian packages to use it in the future.</p>

<p>But then again, the last time something like this happened, it was
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed">Heartbleed</a> and GnuTLS wasn't affected, so who knows... It is
likely that people don't have OpenSSL in mind when they suggest moving
away from GnuTLS and instead think of other TLS libraries like
<a href="https://tls.mbed.org/">mbedtls</a> (previously known as PolarSSL), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Security_Services">NSS</a>, <a href="https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/">BoringSSL</a>,
<a href="https://www.libressl.org/">LibreSSL</a> and so on. Not that those are totally sinless either...</p>

<p>"This is fine", as they say...</p>

        <p>2020-07-26</p>

        <p>We’ve been doing a lot of mob programming at work the last year or so and I’ve seen that I have a different attitude to naming things than others on my team. When I see that a name can be improved I always think this is priority number one. My colleagues often say “later”.</p>

<p>I also saw something related recently when doing a programming course internally at work. I sat and helped a guy with an issue he was having. I saw a really bad variable name and recommended he change it. He said “later, I just need to fix this first”. I pushed the point once more saying “trust me” and then left him to his devices. A few minutes later he asked for help again, being totally stuck. Renaming the variable got him immediately unstuck. He had wasted lots of time because the name put him in a mental trap.</p>

<p>My philosophy is: <em>there are only two acceptable types of names: good names and metasyntactic names</em>. If you have a name that is bad or just a bit misleading it’s better to rename it to <code>foo</code> NOW.</p>

<p>I believe good (or metasyntactic) names lead to easier problem solving and less effort in programming. It’s not just something we add at the end to make the code more understandable to others or future you. To me the primary thing we work with in programming isn’t numbers or computation, but language.</p>

<p><span>Millions of users use Uber’s applications everyday across the globe, accessing seamless transportation or meal delivery at the push of a button. To achieve this accessibility at scale, our mobile apps require low-latency and highly reliable network communication, regardless of where customers use our services.</span></p>
<p><span>The network communication for all of Uber’s mobile applications are powered by the edge and the mobile networking infrastructures. The edge infrastructure provides secure connectivity for the HTTPS traffic originating from the mobile apps to the backend services. Uber’s edge infrastructure combines the global presence of public cloud platforms that help reduce app latencies with the additional ability to fallback to our own managed data-centers when required for enhanced reliability.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On the mobile side, a core component of our networking stack is the failure handler that intelligently routes all mobile traffic from our applications to the edge infrastructure. Uber’s failure handler was designed as a finite state machine (FSM) to ensure that the traffic sent via cloud infrastructure is maximized. During times when the cloud infrastructure is unreachable, the failover handler dynamically re-routes the traffic directly to Uber’s data centers without significantly impacting the user’s experience.</span></p>
<p><span>After rolling out the failover handler at Uber, we witnessed a 25-30 percent reduction in tail-end latencies for the HTTPS traffic when compared to previous solutions. The failover handler has also ensured reasonably low error rates for the HTTPS traffic during periods of outages faced by the public cloud infrastructure. Combined, these performance improvements have led to better user experiences for markets worldwide.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In this article, we share the challenges faced in designing the mobile failover handler for Uber’s applications, and how the design evolved as we operationalized the system across our users globally.</span></p>

<h2><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure</span></h2>
<p><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure comprises front-end proxy servers that terminate secure TLS over </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol"><span>TCP</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC"><span>QUIC</span></a><span> connections from the mobile apps. The HTTPS traffic originating from the mobile apps over these connections are then forwarded to the backend services in the nearest data-center using existing </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_pool"><span>connection pools</span></a><span>. The edge infrastructure spans across public cloud and privately managed infrastructures as shown in Figure 1, below, with the front-end proxies hosted both within public cloud regions and in Uber’s managed data-centers:&nbsp;</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_8070" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8070"><a href="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2nd-.gif"><img src="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2nd-.gif" alt="" width="1200" height="541"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-8070">Figure 1. Uber’s edge infrastructure powers our mobile applications by routing mobile traffic either over the cloud infrastructure or directly to Uber’s managed data-centers.</figcaption></figure>

<p><span>Hosting the edge servers on public cloud enables us to leverage its widely deployed network of </span><a href="https://networkencyclopedia.com/point-of-presence-pop/"><span>Points of Presence</span></a><span>, or PoPs. </span><span>Terminating the QUIC/TCP connection closer to the user generally </span><span>results in better performance, translating to lower latency and error rates for the HTTPS traffic. In addition, the cloud’s front-end servers support newer, more </span><a href="https://eng.uber.com/employing-quic-protocol/"><span>performant protocols</span></a><span> that further lowers the latencies during poor network conditions. As such, it is critical we maximize the amount of HTTPS requests from mobile routed via the cloud regions to ensure the best possible user experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, if app requests are always routed to the cloud, we risk significant service interruptions during both&nbsp; local- and global-level disruptions. Such connectivity issues can be </span><a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi20spring_burnett_prepub.pdf"><span>attributed</span></a><span> to various components of the public clouds or the intermediate ISPs. Issues due to DNS service, load balancers, BGP routing, mis-configurations of network middleboxes, cloud outages etc. can lead to DNS or QUIC/ TCP connection timeouts. When disruptions occur, Uber’s platform must have the ability to dynamically failover and reroute incoming requests to our private data centers to ensure uninterrupted service.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The front-end servers hosted in the cloud and data-centers are registered as different </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name"><span>domain names</span></a><span>. By selecting the most appropriate domain-name, the mobile apps can route requests either through the cloud regions or directly to the Uber data-centers.</span></p>

<h2><span>Mobile Failover handling</span></h2>
<p><span>To facilitate highly performant and reliable app experiences for our users, we built an in-house failover handler that resides within the mobile networking stack as an interceptor placed above the core HTTP2/QUIC layers. As HTTPS requests are generated from the application, they pass through the failover handler, that rewrites the domain-name (or host-name) before they are processed by the core HTTP library. This ensures that the HTTPS traffic can be dynamically routed to the appropriate edge servers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Asynchronously, the failover handler continuously monitors the health of the domains and switches the domain if required based on the errors received from the HTTPS responses. The logic that decides when to switch the domains is the core component of the failover handler, and the main topic of discussion in this article.</span></p>
<p><span>The failover handler uses network errors for HTTPS responses as the signal to detect reachability issues with the domain. The fundamental challenge when designing the failover handler was distinguishing between errors on the user’s end due to mobile connectivity failures and errors on our end due to edge infrastructure unavailability or unreachability.&nbsp; This problem is further exacerbated due to the high usage of cellular/ LTE networks for Uber’s applications, especially at global scale. Mobile networks are </span><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/00aa/a84be127c04a21b5f5f8dc5d2426921654e2.pdf"><span>less reliable and stable</span></a><span> than their wired counterparts, prone to intermittent failures, connectivity issues, and congestion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Receiving temporary DNS errors or QUIC/ TCP connection timeouts for our primary domain (domain-name for the edge servers hosted within cloud regions) does not necessarily mean that it is unavailable; in most cases, this failure is actually due to an intermittent loss in connectivity. Imagine, for instance, going into a tunnel and losing mobile service. In such a scenario, switching the domain from a primary domain to a back-up domain does not help and may result in </span><i><span>lower</span></i><span> performance once connectivity recovers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Round robin-based failover handler</span></h3>
<p><span>A few straight-foward solutions we tested failed to address this challenge effectively. An earlier iteration of our failover handler used a round robin-based system configured with a list of domains. The first domain was the primary domain that provided the best possible performance. The primary domain was followed by back-up domains, typically Uber’s managed data-center servers, to ensure ability to fallback when the primary domain is unavailable. On receiving a specific network error—DNS errors, timeouts, TCP/TLS errors, and so on—the system switched the domain to the next in the list for all subsequent HTTPS requests.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While this round robin solution met our availability requirements, it had a few drawbacks regarding performance:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Aggressive host switches:</b><span> A few intermittent network errors cause the system to switch domains. Excessive switching across domains may result in unnecessary DNS lookups and connection setups causing additional delays.</span></li>
<li><b>Substantial requests routed to non-performant domains</b><span>: In the event of network errors, the system settles on one of the domains in the list with equal probability after the network recovers. We saw significant sessions settle on the lower-performing back-up domains, despite the primary domain being available. The system would only transition back to the primary domain following another round of network errors.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Threshold-based failover handler</span></h3>
<p><span>To avoid excessive domain switching, we also experimented with a threshold-based failover handler. Instead of triggering failover based on a single network error, the threshold-based solution switches domains only after encountering a minimum number of network errors.&nbsp; However, it proved hard to find a threshold value that worked efficiently across different applications, regions, and network types (LTE, WiFi etc.). Setting the value too low caused unnecessary switching, but setting it too high delayed recovery in scenarios where the primary domains were actually unavailable. Besides, this system did not completely solve the drawbacks of the previous approach.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Edge-driven failover handling</span></h3>
<p><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure has automated recovery mechanisms to mitigate domain failures, such as DNS re-mapping. In this situation, excessive errors on our primary domain triggers a reconfiguration of the domain-name to IP address mapping for the affected domain. DNS propagation is not instantaneous though, since the revised mapping must propagate across all DNS nameservers globally.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Oftentimes, the unreachability of the primary domain is also limited to a small region, a city, or a specific mobile carrier, and cannot be effectively mitigated by DNS mapping updates alone. Mobile apps have a better context of the connectivity conditions and can react in real-time. Hence, we determined that a device-local failover handler is necessary to ensure connectivity in addition to our edge-driven failover handling mechanisms.</span></p>

<h2><span>Failover handler design</span></h2>
<p><span>When designing Uber’s failover handler, we wanted to ensure we hit three main criteria that was lacking in existing solutions we assessed:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Maximize the usage of primary domains: </b><span>&nbsp;We needed our failover handling solution to operate in a way to preferentially route traffic to the primary domains, which typically offer the best performance. Maximizing the amount of HTTPS traffic going through these domains ensures lower latency and a better user experience overall.</span></li>
<li><b>Effectively differentiate between network errors and host-level outages: </b><span>The system required a robust mechanism that could confidently identify actual domain failures and lower the probability of switching to an alternate host because of intermittent mobile network connectivity issues.</span></li>
<li><b>Reduce degraded experience during primary domain outages: </b><span>Our failover …</span></li></ol></div></div>

<p>From the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/technology/twitter-hackers-interview.html"> New York Times story on the recent Twitter hack</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>Mr. O’Connor said other hackers had informed him that Kirk got access to the Twitter credentials when he found a way into Twitter’s internal Slack messaging channel and saw them posted there, along with a service that gave him access to the company’s servers.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>It’s too soon after this incident to put too much faith in the reporting, but let’s assume it’s accurate. A collective cry of “<em>Posting credentials to a Slack channel? How could engineers at Twitter be so stupid?</em>” rose up from the internet. It’s a natural reaction, but it’s not a constructive one.</p>



<p>I don’t personally know any engineers at Twitter, but I have confidence that they have excellent engineers over there, including excellent security folks. So, how do we explain this seemingly obvious security lapse?</p>



<p>The problem is that we on the outside can’t, because we don’t have enough information. This type of lapse is a classic example of a <em>workaround</em>. People in a system use workarounds (they do things the “<em>wrong</em>” way) when there are obstacles to doing things the “right” way.</p>



<p>There are countless possibilities for why people employ workarounds. Maybe some system that’s required for doing it the “right” way is down for some reason, or maybe it simply takes too long or is too hard to do things the “right” way. Combine that with production pressures, and a workaround is born.</p>



<p>I’m willing to bet that there are people in your organization that use workarounds. You probably use some yourself. Identifying those workarounds teaches us something about how the system works, and how people have to do things the “wrong” way to actually get their work done.</p>



<p>Some workarounds, like the Twitter example, are dangerous. But simply observing “they shouldn’t have done that” does nothing to address the problems in the system that motivated the workaround in the first place.</p>



<p>When you see a workaround, don’t ask “how could they be so stupid to do things the obviously wrong way?” Instead, ask “what are the properties of our system that contributed to the development of this workaround?” Because, unless you gain a deeper understanding of your system, the problems that motivated the workaround aren’t going to go away.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div property="content:encoded"><p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this media release used a hypothetical example that suggested that Google used information about users’ health to personalise or target advertisements. Google says that it does not show personalised ads based on health information. This example has been removed from the media release.</em></p>

<p>The ACCC has launched Federal Court proceedings against Google LLC (Google), alleging Google misled Australian consumers to obtain their consent to expand the scope of personal information that Google could collect and combine about consumers’ internet activity, for use by Google, including for targeted advertising.</p>

<p>The ACCC alleges Google misled consumers when it failed to properly inform consumers, and did not gain their explicit informed consent, about its move in 2016 to start combining personal information in consumers’ Google accounts with information about those individuals’ activities on non-Google sites that used Google technology, formerly DoubleClick technology, to display ads.</p>

<p>This meant this data about users’ non-Google online activity became linked to their names and other identifying information held by Google. Previously, this information had been kept separately from users’ Google accounts, meaning the data was not linked to an individual user.</p>

<p>Google then used this newly combined information to improve the commercial performance of its advertising businesses.</p>

<p>The ACCC also alleges that Google misled consumers about a related change to its privacy policy.</p>

<p>“We are taking this action because we consider Google misled Australian consumers about what it planned to do with large amounts of their personal information, including internet activity on websites not connected to Google,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said.</p>

<p>“Google significantly increased the scope of information it collected about consumers on a personally identifiable basis. This included potentially very sensitive and private information about their activities on third party websites. It then used this information to serve up highly targeted advertisements without consumers’ express informed consent,” Mr Sims said.</p>

<p>“We allege that Google did not obtain explicit consent from consumers to take this step.”</p>

<p>“The use of this new combined information allowed Google to increase significantly the value of its advertising products, from which it generated much higher profits.”</p>

<p>“The ACCC considers that consumers effectively pay for Google’s services with their data, so this change introduced by Google increased the “price” of Google’s services, without consumers’ knowledge,” Mr Sims said.</p>

<p><strong>“I agree” notification</strong></p>

<p>The conduct is alleged to have impacted millions of Australians with Google accounts.</p>

<p>From 28 June 2016 until at least December 2018, Google account holders were prompted to click “I agree” to a pop-up notification from Google that purported to explain how it planned to combine their data, and sought the consumers’ consent for this.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p><em>Some new features for your Google Account</em></p>

	<p><em>We’ve introduced some optional features for your account, giving you more control over the data Google collects and how it’s used, while allowing Google to show you more relevant ads.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The notification also stated,&nbsp;<em>“More information will be available in your Google Account making it easier for you to review and control”</em>; and&nbsp;<em>“Google will use this information to make ads across the web more relevant for you.”</em></p>

<p>Before June 2016, Google only collected and used, for advertising purposes, personally identifiable information about Google account users’ activities on Google owned services and apps like Google Search and YouTube.</p>

<p>After June 2016, when consumers clicked on the “I agree” notification, Google began to collect and store a much wider range of personally identifiable information about the online activities of Google account holders, including their use of third-party sites and apps not owned by Google.</p>

<p>Previously, this additional data had been stored separately from a user’s Google account.</p>

<p>Combined with the personal data stored in Google accounts, this provided Google with valuable information with which to sell even more targeted advertising, including through its Google Ad Manager and Google Marketing Platform brands.</p>

<p>The ACCC alleges that the “I agree” notification was misleading, because consumers could not have properly understood the changes Google was making nor how their data would be used, and so did not - and could not - give informed consent.</p>

<p>“We believe that many consumers, if given an informed choice, may have refused Google permission to combine and use such a wide array of their personal information for Google’s own financial benefit,” Mr Sims said.</p>

<p><strong>Privacy policy change</strong></p>

<p>Before 28 June 2016, Google stated in its privacy policy that it&nbsp;<em>“will not combine DoubleClick cookie information with personally identifiable information unless we have your opt-in consent.”</em></p>

<p>On 28 June 2016, Google deleted this statement and inserted the following statement:<em>&nbsp;“[d]epending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.”</em></p>

<p>Google’s privacy policy also states:&nbsp;<em>“[w]e will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent.”</em></p>

<p>The ACCC alleges that Google did not in fact obtain consumers’ explicit consent for this change to the privacy policy, and that Google’s statement that it would not reduce consumers’ rights without their explicit consent was therefore misleading.</p>

<p>“Google made a clear representation about how it would protect users’ privacy. The ACCC alleges that Google made changes without obtaining the explicit consent it had promised consumers it would obtain before altering how it protected their private information,” Mr Sims said.</p>

<p><strong>DoubleClick</strong></p>

<p>In 2008, Google acquired DoubleClick, a supplier of ad-serving technology services to publishers and advertisers.</p>

<p>Google now supplies DoubleClick’s services through its Google Ad Manager and Google Marketing Platform brands, which are the leading suppliers of ad-tech intermediary services.</p>

<p>These services track users’ internet activity on third-party sites that display ads through the use of DoubleClick’s advertising technology.</p>

<p>Google’s acquisition of DoubleClick required approval by competition authorities including the US Federal Trade Commission and the European Commission. The ACCC also reviewed and cleared this transaction.</p>

<p>FTC and EC cleared the acquisition, and in doing so considered submissions from Google that it would not be able to combine DoubleClick’s data on consumers’ internet activity with its own data about consumers’ activity on Google services because, at the time, DoubleClick’s contracts with its users prevented Google from doing so.</p>

<p>The agencies did not, however, rely on these submissions in clearing the acquisition.</p>

<p>Before 28 June 2016, Google collected and stored this information on a non-personally identifiable basis, as stated in its privacy policy.</p>

<p>On 28 June 2016, it changed its privacy policy by removing the term explaining how it would treat this DoubleClick data.</p>

<p><strong>Images</strong></p>

<p>Depending on the device and Google service being used by the consumer, the notification published by Google from 28 June 2016 was presented in a variety of ways. A copy of the notification in the form published to consumers using desktop devices is provided below for reference.</p>

<p>I bit the bullet and reformatted my MacBook Pro over the weekend. My motivation for doing this was to start from scratch to figure out what apps I need. I’m documenting the process I followed here. This guide is a work-in-progress.</p>



<h3>Backing Up My Files</h3>



<p>I wanted to keep it simple and work on organizing all of my files later. So I used the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bombich.com/" target="_blank">Carbon Copy Cloner</a> to do the hard work with backing up all my files over to my Drobo 5N. This took longer than I expected, so be patient.</p>



<h3>Signing Out</h3>



<p>You’ll need to make sure you sign out and deauthorize applications before you reformat.</p>



<h3>Installing Applications and Configuring</h3>



<p>Since I’m a developer, I’m always on the lookout for MacBook setup guides. I found <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.taniarascia.com/setting-up-a-brand-new-mac-for-development/" target="_blank">this</a> impressive guide by Tania Rascia and was inspired to make my own. </p>



<p>After installing <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">Homebrew</a>, here are the apps I installed.</p>



<pre><code>brew install \
  git \
  yarn \
  make 

brew cask install 1password bartender brave-browser carbon-copy-cloner cleanmymac cleanshot screenflow visual-studio-code google-chrome firefox iterm2 docker vlc slack keybase postgres postico postman coda malwarebytes steam dotnet-sdk
</code></pre>



<p>Since I needed to install Mac Store apps, I installed and used the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/mas-cli/mas" target="_blank">mas-cli</a>.</p>



<pre><code>brew install mas</code></pre>



<pre><code>mas install 937984704 1091189122 775737590 634148309 441258766 1274495053 568494494 485812721 497799835

# Amphetamine
# Bear
# iA Writer  
# Logic Pro X
# Magnet
# Microsoft To Do 
# Pocket
# TweetDeck
# Xcode</code></pre>



<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask-versions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cask-versions</a> to install alternative versions of applications that I haven’t upgraded like Alfred.</p>



<pre><code>brew tap homebrew/cask-versions</code></pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-e31d7a75b991deb6415c"><div><h2>Who?</h2><p>I identified with Eric Weinstein so much because of the shared struggles with the educational system.&nbsp;</p><p>Eric became a <strong>beacon of hope</strong> for me when he started sharing his story and lessons he learned throughout his impressive career as an academic, mathematician, physicist, economist, managing director of Thiel Capital, and podcaster.&nbsp;</p><p>Although he’s been told he is dyslexic, dysgraphic, color blind, ADD, and kinesthetic reinforcement deficits, he is proof of the educational system debacles. He says, “All BS. I wasn’t meant for educators, as those are actually their issues with me (i.e. teaching disabilities).”</p><p>He’s an inspiration as I’ve faced similar obstacles especially with the focus of compliance in the educational system over creativity, curiosity, even intellect has <a href="https://www.juandavidcampolargo.com/blog/highschool" target="_blank">hurt me in my educational career</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Why Should You Care?</h2><p>I started writing these <a href="http://juandavidcampolargo.com/newsletter" target="_blank">essays</a> and making <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU87CN_FxGC1q3hzWM0CCDA" target="_blank">videos</a> because <strong>ideas are the currency of the 21st century. </strong>I humbly believe the ideas I share could help others as I pursue my <a href="http://juandavidcampolargo.substack.com/" target="_blank">Curiosities</a><em>.</em></p><p>Eric Weinstein’s ideas have awakened me and showed a world unknown to most people, such as the real world of academia and science.&nbsp;</p><p>One of these ideas is what he calls the <strong>DISC</strong> (Distributed Idea Suppression Complex) which explains how disruptive and innovative ideas that challenge the status quo are suppressed. Keeping institutions safe from individuals who create change.&nbsp;</p><p>The DISC is spread throughout major institutions such as in academia, the mainstream media, and politics. It tries to undermine ideas that may challenge or weaken the elite. This isn’t directly planned, and it’s not under central control.&nbsp;</p><p>Eric and his family have been victims of the DISC multiple times. Eric in physics, his wife in economics, and his brother in biology. He started noticing the same pattern in politics when MSNBC hid polling graphics of presidential candidate Andrew Yang.&nbsp;</p><p>The DISC is only one of these marvelous ideas that Eric explores in his podcast called The Portal where he explores subjects including science, economics, culture, politics, and business.&nbsp;</p><p>The goal of the show is to help you see the world through a different lens, which opens up your mind to new ways of viewing events and your life. Each guest is a portal to a reality showcasing what we would normally consider impossible, are indeed possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s visit The Portal!</p><h2>Favorite Episodes</h2><p>Eric launched The Portal in June 2019 and less than a year later has created a community of people who want to explore this hidden reality and discover new portals.&nbsp;</p><p>Eric has wide expertise in many fields, but what’s interesting is how he engages your mind, moves your heart, and lights a spark in your soul. Eric can discover unexplored worlds and bring them back to his audience. Sometimes, complex or hard to understand, but always interesting where you get the sense of upgrading your mind.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are my favorite episodes:</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9f0W2KD5s" target="_blank"><strong>1: Peter Thiel:</strong></a><strong> </strong>this was how I found the podcast. Peter rarely appears on interviews, so I knew this one had to be special. Peter Thiel is one of the most influential and contrarian thinkers of the last decades. He’s also the co-founder of PayPal and Palantir. He was also the first big investor in Facebook.&nbsp;</p><p>Peter and Eric challenge our way of thinking and encourage us to see things differently. For instance, they discussed the relationship between growth and violence. Thiel argues that if economic growth is low, violence is more likely to arise. He highlights that violence among humans is high because according to Rene Girard, we want what other people want, giving rise to conflict.&nbsp;</p><p>This may be one of the best episodes in the history of podcasts. I found this conversion can help you understand Girard’s theories' implications in society, especially in a time of wealth gap inequality, racial conflicts, and a pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>They also discussed the era of stagnation, the future of education, student debt, the broken world of academia, and polymaths.&nbsp;</p><p>Peter (a conservative) and Eric (a progressive) discuss ideas with unique and often opposing views as they try to find a solution and reach an agreement on his arguments.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://plinkhq.com/i/1469999563/e/1000462975502" target="_blank"><strong>19: Bret Weinstein - The Prediction and the DISC:</strong></a><strong> </strong>In this rigid conversation with Bret, they talked about the DISC and how it affected Bret with one of his biology discoveries.&nbsp;</p><p>In this episode, Eric eagerly tries to get his brother to tell the story of his powerful finding. Bret discovered that the mice we use for medical trials have ultra-long telomeres (something humans don’t have) and that these “hide” the dangers of certain medicines. This same discovery could cure cancer and end aging.&nbsp;</p><p>After he discovered this, he tried to go the usual path of peer-review and so on. According to the podcast, he was silenced. Yet his findings were taken and made someone else the Nobel Prize winner.&nbsp;</p><p>A mind-blowing episode that will stir your curiosity and make you learn about the findings, the DISC, and The Portal.</p><p><a href="https://plinkhq.com/i/1469999563/e/1000460365533" target="_blank"><strong>17: Anna Khachiyan - Reconstructing The Mystical Feminine From The Ashes Of “The Feminine Mystique”:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Eric interviews Anna, who is a Russian-American social, literary and artistic theorist. She is also the co-host of the fierce and popular Red Scare podcast.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>At the beginning of the conversation, Eric tells her, “I've been addicted to your podcast not quite understanding why. It's one of the strangest things I've ever found.” That’s exactly how I felt.&nbsp;</p><p>They talked about mystery and how society thought we wanted clarity and directness. But what we actually want is mystery, especially in our relationships.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, they talked about the importance of mystery and what it means to be mysterious. This episode will help you perceive the significance of how we can use mystery in our lives.</p><p>I’ll be honest, I don’t know why I liked this episode, but I listened to it several times and it was weirdly fascinating.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BONUS </strong><a href="https://plinkhq.com/i/1469999563/e/1000477637846" target="_blank"><strong>36: Dark Matter, Black Matters and All That Jazz</strong></a><strong> </strong>with Stephon Alexander is an amazing episode to learn more about physics, racial issues, and music.&nbsp;</p><h2>Geometrically Unified</h2><p>I disagree with many of Eric’s views, however I still consider him a role model because of his love and passion for science. He proposed a theory of everything called Geometric Unity where he tried to explain and combine all physical aspects of the universe.&nbsp;</p><p>I love learning about science. I read books, email experts, watch interviews, write essays, and listen to podcasts like The Portal to learn more about science.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Science</strong> combined with <strong>entrepreneurship</strong> has the power to create a world of progress and technological advancement, so we create a world of equality, fairness, and peace.&nbsp; That’s what I hope to do with my life.&nbsp;</p><p>I hope you find Eric’s work as interesting, fascinating, and curious as I have.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks to <a href="https://jenvermet.com/" target="_blank">Jen</a>, <a href="https://salman.io/" target="_blank">Salman</a>, <a href="https://juliasaxena.com/" target="_blank">Julia</a>, and <a href="https://fullofkrapp.com/" target="_blank">Kevin</a>  for reading drafts of this essay. </p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595770382135_5451"><p>If you’re into interesting ideas (like the one you just read), join us at our<a href="https://juandavidcampolargo.com/newsletter"> </a><a href="https://juandavidcampolargo.com/newsletter" target="_blank"><strong>newsletter</strong></a>, and I’ll send you new essays right when they come out. <br></p></div></div>]]>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This essay is an illustrated proof of the No Free Lunch (NFL) theorem; the NFL theorem has many variants, which all say slightly different things. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_theorem">most famous one</a> says, roughly, that every learning algorithm has the same performance, when averaged across all possible target functions. In other words, there is no universal learning algorithm that outperforms every other algorithm on every learning task.</p>

<p>Throughout this essay, I'm going to be refering to a "learning algorithm". If you're unfamiliar, in the machine learning context, a learning algorithm is an algorithm that takes in \(S\), a series of (x,y) pairs, i.e. our training data or training set, from some target function and outputs a hypothesis, which is a function that tries to be close to the original target function. Note that the inputs and outputs aren't necessarily  binary, but it's easier to illustrate them as such, and the proof is not affected. Learning algorithms are often evaluated by looking at the error rate, which in the case of classification, is the proportion of \((x,y)\) pairs it predicts incorrectly.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/hypothesis.svg"></p>

<p>In this essay, I will focus on an easier NFL theorem (from <a href="https://www.cse.huji.ac.il/%7Eshais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/index.html">Understanding Machine Learning by Shai Shalev-Shwartz and Shai Ben-David</a>) which says, roughly, for any learning algorithm that outputs a binary function, there exists a distribution that will cause it to output a hypothesis with a high error rate, even when there exists another function that can achieve 0 error on the distribution. In other words, for every learning algorithm, we can find a distribution that can trip up the learning algorithm.</p>

<p>How do we formalize this? </p>

<p>The NFL theorem we're going to prove states that:</p>

<p>Say we have a learning algorithm A which outputs a binary classifier (this is our hypothesis) over a domain \(X\). </p>

<p>Next, let's define an error or loss function, which will tell us how well our output hypothesis does on the actual distribution. We'll use the <strong>1</strong> loss function \(L\) which, when given two inputs, outputs 0 if the two values match, otherwise it outputs 1. Then, there exists a distribution \(D\) over \(X \times \{0,1\}\) (i.e. a distribution over possible \((x,\{0,1\})\) values) such that:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There exists a function \(f: X \to \{0,1\}\) with \(L_D(f) = 0\). That is, there is some binary function over \(X\) such that the expected loss of \(f\) over \(D\) is 0. In other words, there is some function which will correctly classify all the points in our distribution correctly.</p></li>
<li><p>With probability of at least \(\frac{1}{7}\) over the choice of \(S \sim D^m\) \(L_D(A(S)) \ge \frac{1}{8}\). In other words, for at least \(\frac{1}{7}\) of all possible training sets of size \(m\) from \(D\), the expected loss of output of the training algorithm on the training set is at least  \(\frac{1}{8}\). (Note that our loss function is defined here as the average <strong>1</strong> loss across all points in the distribution).</p></li>
<li><p>The distribution \(D\) is defined over \(2m\) points, so our training set will consist of at most \(m\) unique values, i.e. half of the distribution's points. </p></li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/nfl-base.svg"></p>

<p>To prove this, we are actually going to prove something different, but equivalent. Instead, we are going to prove that:</p>

<p>\(\underset{i \in [T]}{\text{max }} \underset{S \sim D_i^m}{\mathbb{E}} [L_{D_i}(A(S))] \ge 1/4\)</p>

<p>That is, if we run our learning algorithm on training sets of size \(m\), across a family of distributions \(D_1-D_T\), the largest such expected loss will be at least \(\frac{1}{4}\). In other words, we will show that at least one distribution \(D_i\) from this group will trip up our algorithm.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/dist-one-fourth-error.svg"></p>

<p>To see how these two statements are equivalent, we just apply a modified version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov%27s_inequality">Markvov's inequality</a>. This lower bounds how likely a random variable is to be greater than some value:</p>

<p>\(P(X \ge a) \ge \frac{\mathbb{E}[X]-a}{1-a}\)</p>

<p>Applying that to our inequality above, we see that:</p>

<p>\(P(L_{D_i}(A(S)) \ge \frac{1}{8}) \ge \frac{\frac{1}{4}-\frac{1}{8}}{\frac{7}{8}} \ge \frac{1}{7}\) as desired. So now we just need prove this new inequality.</p>

<p>Before that, here's the intuition for why this inequality is true:</p>

<p>First, our learning algorithm only gets half of all possible points as its training set. This means our algorithm knows nothing about the labels of the other half of the points. Now, if we assume that every function over these unknown points is equally likely, then each point is either 1 or a 0. This means that our algorithm can only guess for these unknown points, which makes its expected error rate 0.5. So in the best case, it'll still get an error rate of 0 on the half it sees and 0.5 on the half it doesn't see, which makes its overall error 0.25.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/seen-unseen-data.svg"></p>

<h3>The Proof</h3>

<p>Now, let's begin the proof.</p>

<p>Let \(C \subseteq X\) such that \(|C| = 2m\). So it's a subset of our input space that's of size \(2m\). </p>

<p>Notice that there are \(T = 2^{2m}\) possible functions from \(C\) to \(\{0,1\}\).  Let \(D_i\) be the distribution over \(D\) that only assigns probability to the \((x,f_i(x))\) pairs for the corresponding function. This captures the idea that our input space \(C\) is twice the size of our training set, and that each function is equally likely. </p>

<p>Each function is now turned into a probability distribution that places \(\frac{1}{|C|}\) probability if the given \((x,y)\) point is one of the function's input/output pairs, and 0 probability otherwise. So each unique function has a unique distribution associated with it.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/function-dist.svg"></p>

<p>Recall that we're trying to calculate \(\underset{i \in [T]}{\text{max }} \underset{S \sim D_i^m}{\mathbb{E}} [L_{D_i}(A(S))]\), i.e. the expected loss over all possible training examples, with regards to the distribution that maximizes this loss. </p>

<p>For any given distribution,  \(\underset{S \sim D_i^m}{\mathbb{E}} [L_{D_i}(A(S))]\) is the loss for a given training set, averaged over all possible choices of training data. </p>

<p>If our input space consists of \(2m\) points and our training data consists of a sequence of \(m\) points, then there are \(k = (2m)^m\) possible sequences. </p>

<p>Below, we'll let \(S_j^i\) be the \(i^{th}\) possible sequence of training data, labeled with the \(j^{th}\) possible function. </p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/sij.svg"> </p>

<p>Thus, we know that \(\underset{S \sim D_i^m}{\mathbb{E}}[L_{D_i}(A(S))] = \frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=1}^kL_{D_i}(A(S^i_j))\). In other words, for any one given distribution of data, the expected loss of our learning algorithm (across all training data sets) is equal to the expected loss if we take \(m\) training points, averaged across all possible functions that could label the data.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/one-distr-error.svg"> </p>

<p>Recall that, from above, we care about taking the <strong>maximum</strong> error across all possible distributions; by definition, this will be at least as big as the <strong>average</strong> loss across all distributions. Thus, we know that:</p>

<p>\(\underset{i \in [T]}{\text{max }} \frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=1}^kL_{D_i}(A(S^i_j)) \ge \frac{1}{T}\sum^T_{i=1}\frac{1}{k}\sum^k_{j=1}L_{D_i}(A(S^i_j))\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/sum-distr-training.svg"> </p>

<p>Next, it doesn't really matter if we take the average over all distributions first or the average over all training sets first. Thus, we can switch the order of the summations to get the same value:</p>

<p>\(\frac{1}{T}\sum^T_{i=1}\frac{1}{k}\sum^k_{j=1}L_{D_i}(A(S^i_j)) =\frac{1}{k}\sum^k_{j=1}\frac{1}{T}\sum^T_{i=1}L_{D_i}(A(S^i_j))\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/sum-training-distr.svg"></p>

<p>Now, if we're taking the loss averaged over all training data, notice that this will necessarily have to be at least as big as the loss given by the training data which leads to the <strong>smallest</strong> average loss. </p>

<p>Thus, we can replace our inequality with a smaller, simpler one. Our inequality has to be at least as large as the average loss (across all functions) when applied to that specific training set.</p>

<p>\(\frac{1}{k}\sum^k_{j=1}\frac{1}{T}\sum^T_{i=1}L_{D_i}(A(S^i_j)) \ge \underset{j \in [k]}{\text{min }} \frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^TL_{D_i}(A(S^i_j))\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/one-training-error.svg"> </p>

<p>So we've been abstractly talking about the loss function for a while now. What does \(L_{D_i}(h)\) actually represent? We want it to be how well our hypothesis does on a specific distribution \(D_i\). One straightforward way to formalize this is to just go through all \((x,y)\) pairs in \(D_i\) and take the average <strong>1</strong> loss between \(y\) and \(h(x)\):</p>

<p>\(L_{D_i}(h) = \frac{1}{2m}\sum_{x\in C}\mathbf{1}[h(x) \not= f_i(x)]\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/loss.svg"></p>

<p>Next, let's fix some \(j \in [k]\), which has \(m\) training examples given by \(S_j = (x_1,..,x_m)\). Let \((v_1, ...,v_p)\) be the examples in \(C\) (all data points) that <strong>aren't</strong> in \(S_j\). We can see that \(p \ge m\) because at most we have half the data from the distribution, which is when we have no duplicates.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/p-data.svg"> </p>

<p>Thus:</p>

<p>\(L_{D_i}(h) =\frac{1}{2m}\sum_{x\in C}\mathbf{1}[h(x) \not= f_i(x)] \ge \frac{1}{2p}\sum_{j=1}^p\mathbf{1}[h(v_j) \not= f_i(v_j)]\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/loss-p.svg"> </p>

<p>In other words, the average loss over all points in the distribution is at least half of the average loss over all points <strong>not</strong> in the training set. </p>

<p>Now, we can substitutue this in for \(L_{D_i}\) from our inequality earlier to get:</p>

<p>\( \frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^TL_{D_i}(A(S^i_j)) \ge \frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^T \frac{1}{2p}\sum_{j=1}^p\mathbf{1}[h(v_j) \not= f_i(v_j)]\)</p>

<p>So now we're taking the loss across all functions, across all points in \((v_1,...,v_p)\). Like before, we can swap the order of the summations:</p>

<p>\( \frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^T \frac{1}{2p}\sum_{j=1}^p\mathbf{1}[h(v_j) \not= f_i(v_j)] =\frac{1}{2p}\sum_{j=1}^p\frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^T \mathbf{1}[h(v_j) \not= f_i(v_j)]\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/sum-p-dist.svg"></p>

<p>Once again, we can upper bound this inequality by noticing that the average loss across all points in \((v_1,...,v_p)\) and across all functions has to be at least the loss of the point \(v_r\) which we assume to be the point which gives the minimal loss:</p>

<p>\(\frac{1}{2p}\sum_{j=1}^p\frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^T \mathbf{1}[h(v_j) \not= f_i(v_j)] \ge \frac{1}{2}\underset{r \in [p]}{\text{min}}\frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^T \mathbf{1}[h(v_r) \not= f_i(v_r)]\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/one-p-error.svg"></p>

<p>Now, notice that we can partition \([T]\) into \((f_a, f_b)\) pairs such that \(f_a\) and \(f_b\) agree on every value except …</p></div></div>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>In modern computer programming, concurrency is often required to accelerate solving a problem. In Python programming, we usually have the three library options to achieve concurrency, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html"><code>multiprocessing</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html"><code>threading</code></a>, and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html"><code>asyncio</code></a>. Recently, I was aware that as a scripting language Python’s behavior of concurrency has subtle differences compared to the conventional compiled languages such as C/C++.</p>



<p><a href="https://realpython.com/">Real Python</a> has already given a good <a href="https://realpython.com/python-concurrency/">tutorial</a> with <a href="https://github.com/realpython/materials/tree/master/concurrency-overview">code examples</a> on Python concurrency. In this blog post, I would like to discuss the <code>multiprocessing</code>, <code>threading</code>, and <code>asyncio</code> in Python from a high-level, with some additional caveats that the Real Python tutorial has not mentioned. I have also borrowed some good diagrams from their tutorial and the readers should give the credits to them on those illustrations.</p>

<h3 id="cpu-bound-vs-io-bound">CPU-Bound VS I/O-Bound</h3>

<p>The problems that our modern computers are trying to solve could be generally categorized as CPU-bound or I/O-bound. Whether the problem is CPU-bound or I/O-bound affects our selection from the concurrency libraries <code>multiprocessing</code>, <code>threading</code>, and <code>asyncio</code>. Of course, in some scenarios, the algorithm design for solving the problem might change the problem from CPU-bound to I/O-bound or vice versa. The concept of CPU-bound and I/O-bound are universal for all programming languages.</p>

<h4 id="cpu-bound">CPU-Bound</h4>

<p>CPU-bound refers to a condition when the time for it to complete the task is determined principally by the speed of the central processor. The faster clock-rate CPU we have, the higher performance of our program will have.</p>

<div>

    <figcaption>Single-Process Single-Thread Synchronous for CPU-Bound</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>Most of single computer programs are CPU-bound. For example, given a list of numbers, computing the sum of all the numbers in the list.</p>

<h4 id="io-bound">I/O-Bound</h4>

<p>I/O bound refers to a condition when the time it takes to complete a computation is determined principally by the period spent waiting for input/output operations to be completed. This is the opposite of a task being CPU bound. Increasing CPU clock-rate will not increase the performance of our program significantly. On the contrary, if we have faster I/O, such as faster memory I/O, hard drive I/O, network I/O, etc, the performance of our program will boost.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<p>Most of the web service related programs are I/O-bound. For example, given a list of restaurant names, finding out their ratings on Yelp.</p>

<h3 id="process-vs-thread-in-python">Process VS Thread in Python</h3>

<h4 id="process-in-python">Process in Python</h4>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_interpreter_lock">global interpreter lock</a> (GIL) is a mechanism used in computer-language interpreters to synchronize the execution of threads so that only one native thread can execute at a time. An interpreter that uses GIL always allows exactly one native thread to execute at a time, even if run on a multi-core processor. Note that the native thread here is the number of threads in the physical CPU core, instead of the thread concept in the programming languages.</p>



<p>Because Python interpreter uses GIL, a single-process Python program could only use one native thread during execution. That means single-process Python program could not utilize CPU more than 100% (we define the full utilization of a native thread to be 100%) regardless whether it is single-process single-thread or single-process multi-thread. Conventional compiled programming languages, such as C/C++, do not have interpreter, not even mention GIL. Therefore, for a single-process multi-thread C/C++ program, it could utilize many CPU cores and many native threads, and the CPU utilization could be greater than 100%.</p>



<p>Therefore, for a CPU-bound task in Python, we would have to write multi-process Python program to maximize its performance.</p>

<h4 id="thread-in-python">Thread in Python</h4>

<p>Because a single-process Python could only use one CPU native thread. No matter how many threads were used in a single-process Python program, a single-process multi-thread Python program could only achieve at most 100% CPU utilization.</p>



<p>Therefore, for a CPU-bound task in Python, single-process multi-thread Python program would not improve the performance. However, this does not mean multi-thread is useless in Python. For a I/O-bound task in Python, multi-thread could be used to improve the program performance.</p>

<h3 id="multiprocessing-vs-threading-vs-asyncio-in-python">Multiprocessing VS Threading VS AsyncIO in Python</h3>

<h4 id="multiprocessing">Multiprocessing</h4>

<p>Using Python <code>multiprocessing</code>, we are able to run a Python using multiple processes. In principle, a multi-process Python program could fully utilize all the CPU cores and native threads available, by creating multiple Python interpreters on many native threads. Because all the processes are independent to each other, and they don’t share memory. To do collaborative tasks in Python using <code>multiprocessing</code>, it requires to use the API provided the operating system. Therefore, there will be slightly large overhead.</p>

<div>
<figure>

    <figcaption>Multi-Process for CPU-Bound</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>Therefore, for a CPU-bound task in Python, <code>multiprocessing</code> would be a perfect library to use to maximize the performance.</p>

<h4 id="threading">Threading</h4>

<p>Using Python <code>threading</code>, we are able to make better use of the CPU sitting idle when waiting for the I/O. By overlapping the waiting time for requests, we are able to improve the performance. In addition, because all the threads share the same memory, to do collaborative tasks in Python using <code>threading</code>, we would have to be careful and use locks when necessary. Lock and unlock make sure that only one thread could write to memory at one time, but this will also introduce some overhead. Note that the threads we discussed here are different to the native threads in CPU core. The number of native threads in CPU core is usually 2 nowadays, but the number of threads in a single-process Python program could be much larger than 2.</p>

<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://leimao.github.io/images/blog/2020-07-11-Python-Concurrency-High-Level/Threading.webp">
    <figcaption>Single-Process Multi-Thread for I/O-Bound</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>Therefore, for a I/O-bound task in Python, <code>threading</code> could be a good library candidate to use to maximize the performance.</p>



<p>It should also be noted that all the threads are in a pool and there is an executer from the operating system managing the threads deciding who to run and when to run. This can be a short-coming of <code>threading</code> because the operating system actually knows about each thread and can interrupt it at any time to start running a different thread. This is called pre-emptive multitasking since the operating system can pre-empt your thread to make the switch.</p>

<h4 id="asyncio">AsyncIO</h4>

<p>Given <code>threading</code> is using multi-thread to maximize the performance of a I/O-bound task in Python, we wonder if using multi-thread is necessary. The answer is no, if you know when to switch the tasks. For example, for each thread in a Python program using <code>threading</code>, it will really stay idle between the request is sent and the result is returned. If somehow a thread could know the time I/O request has been sent, it could switch to do another task, without staying idle, and one thread should be sufficient to manage all these tasks. Without the thread management overhead, the execution should be faster for a I/O-bound task. Obviously, <code>threading</code> could not do it, but we have <code>asyncio</code>.</p>



<p>Using Python <code>asyncio</code>, we are also able to make better use of the CPU sitting idle when waiting for the I/O. What’s different to <code>threading</code> is that, <code>asyncio</code> is single-process and single-thread. There is an event loop in <code>asyncio</code> which routinely measure the progress of the tasks. If the event loop has measured any progress, it would schedule another task for execution, therefore, minimizing the time spent on waiting I/O. This is also called cooperative multitasking. The tasks must cooperate by announcing when they are ready to be switched out.</p>

    <figcaption>Single-Process Single-Thread Asynchronous for I/O-Bound</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>The short-coming of <code>asyncio</code> is that the even loop would not know what are the progresses if we don’t tell it. This requires some additional effort when we write the programs using <code>asyncio</code>.</p>

<h4 id="htop-vs-top">HTOP vs TOP</h4>

<p><code>htop</code> would sometimes misinterpret multi-thread Python programs as multi-process programs, as it would show multiple <code>PID</code>s for the Python program. <code>top</code> does not have this problem. On StackOverflow, there is also a such <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38544265/multithreaded-python-program-starting-multiple-processes">observation</a>.</p>

      <h3>Harry Eng the Master Bottle Filler.</h3>
      <p>Harry was born in 1932 and died in 1996. He was  a school teacher, educational consultant, inventor, and magician. 
        A web search will tell you a little about his many talents but in summary: </p>
      <p><strong>Everything he did was intended to teach you to think. </strong></p>
      <p>Here are some of his bottles that are in the Puzzle Museum.</p>
      
      <p>This bottle contains his "Trademark" knot. It is, as always, too large to come out of the bottle, but also the stick  plus cord is too wide for the neck of the bottle.</p>

When he and his friends had finished their bottle of wine, he took the bottle up to his room. He then filled it with a book of matches, menu, and the pack of cards as a gift for us. This is a particular favourite as he assured us that the only tools he had were  a pencil and rubber bands. </p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>To those of you who give advice on which languages, methodologies, architectures, or whatever else to use, I want to start by saying thank you. Your advice is vital to the growth of millions of people like me who are early in their careers.</p>

<p>But I’ve noticed a pattern with software engineering advice that leads to over-engineering and unnecessary arguments. So I have a request:</p>

<p><em>Please make your advice more specific</em></p>

<p>It’s too often overlooked that there isn’t just one type of “software”, thus it is rare for advice to be applicable to every situation. For example, advice for testing a small B2B web app might not work for embedded device firmware. But it might work for a large B2C web app. And since readers will rarely have experience in all of those situations, I think we should start being more explicit about the applicability of our advice.</p>

<p>Being more specific might help address two big time sinks in the industry:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cargo_culting">Cargo-culting</a>, like when people read how great Kubernetes works for Netflix, but then they decide to use it for a little Django app (that was me a few years ago).</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding">Bikeshedding</a>, like when people argue incessantly that a language is useless because it can’t be used in some niche.</li>
</ol>

<p>A good start might be answering questions like the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Does your advice apply to my scale? (local restaurant website vs. Youtube.com)</li>
  <li>Does your advice apply to my type of product? (library, web app, CLI tool, firmware, on/off-premise, etc.)</li>
  <li>Does your advice apply to my type of users? (developers, enterprises, regular people, etc.)</li>
  <li>If not, what should I use instead? (like <a href="https://adamdrake.com/command-line-tools-can-be-235x-faster-than-your-hadoop-cluster.html">replacing Hadoop with <code>find/xargs/awk</code></a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, it’s hard to find the right balance between hand-holding readers or just saying “buyer beware”. But hopefully spending time to add an extra subheading on “Applicability” to READMEs or blog posts will pay for itself in time spent over-engineering and arguing over minutiae.</p>

<article id="post-25">
<div>

<div>
<p>Phenomenology is the study of lived experience from a first-person perspective. As of yet, it has not been applied to incels. Here I will argue that it should be. </p>
<p>An incel is an involuntary celibate, a person who is unable to find a romantic partner despite desiring one. Previously ignored, incels have recently gained a staggering prominence among scholars of violent extremism. For example, this year the Royal Canadian Mounted Police <a href="https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/csis-scrs/documents/publications/PubRep-2019-E.pdf">added incels</a> to their Ideologically Motivated Violent Extremism classification, effectively labeling them as terrorists.</p>
<p>However, from the point of view of incels, this is all rather baffling; while a handful may fit the mold, violence against the public by an ideology of extremism is as foreign to incels as it is to the reader.</p>
<p>Most academics do present their work by stating that the vast majority of incels are neither violent nor extremist. However, as existing research magnifies the attention given to the extremist variant, the impression is given that all incels are alike, and all are a danger. This is a failure of contextualization, one whose results we have seen before as research developed in the wake of the 9/11 attacks: Islam became securitized, not because it was a security threat, but rather because the majority of attention was focused on a few violent extremists, tainting in the process every other Western non-extremist Muslim.</p>
<p>For incels, the misattribution of their beliefs and desires has caused trouble for many of them: How are they to open up and discuss their plights of loneliness and hopelessness if public perception is that incels are people only interested in violence? The answer is that often they simply can’t.</p>
<p>Perhaps worse still, scorn received from outsiders to the community often leads to a process of chiseling, chipping away at the mental health of incels. Not only must then they carry a burden of solitude, but they also must retreat from the public eye in order to avoid further ostracizement. In practice, such alienation may eventually compound into mental disorders like anxiety and depression, or in extreme cases into self-harm and even suicide.</p>
<p>A proposed solution to this issue is phenomenology. For one, responsible research should seek to avoid unnecessary securitization and promote effective de-escalation. Secondly, resources should be significantly expended towards understanding inceldom as a life situation. The result will be a wider and better understanding of incels at large, as well as a more accurate portrayal of the community to the public.</p>

a Makefile and some CSS that builds a HTML and PDF version of a resume from
plain Markdown source.</p>
<p>Plain text source has all the usual benefits (plays nice with version control,
diff, grep, etc.), but this approach has the additional advantage that it has
very light dependencies: two pure Python packages that can be pip installed
(<a href="https://python-markdown.github.io/">python-markdown</a> and
<a href="https://weasyprint.org/">weasyprint</a>). You don’t need pandoc or LaTeX.</p>
<p>To use it: clone the repository, install the dependencies, edit the
file
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/williamsmj/resume.md/main/resume.md">resume.md</a>
(which is very simple vanilla Markdown), then run <code>make</code>. You’ll get
a HTML file that looks like this <img src="https://mike.place/post/resume.md/resume.png" alt="Screenshot ofresume.html">
and a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/williamsmj/resume.md/main/resume.pdf">PDF that looks very
similar</a>.
Edit the CSS to change fonts, spacing, layout, etc. See <a href="https://github.com/williamsmj/resume.md">the README for

<h2>TRIPUTER</h2>

<p>
I bought in September 2016 an FPGA development board called <b>Cyclone V GX Starter Kit</b> from
<a href="http://www.terasic.com.tw/" target="_blank">Terasic</a> (see Figure 1). It costs 179 US$ and uses
a 28-nm FPGA with six 3.125 Gbps transceiver channels from Altera. The board offers a 32-bit wide LPDDR2 DRAM 
memory with 512 Mbytes capacity. This device has a very high bandwidth for many applications. In addition the
board has a HDMI output, an audio device, an SD card interface, many LEDs and switches and some expansion
connectors.
</p>

<p>
The plan is to realize with this board a "multiple computer" system. The name TRIPUTER is an indication of how
many systems will be integrated. The first one will be the PC532 running NetBSD. The second one will be the
Ceres-3 using Oberon. Currently the last one will be the BBC computer with the 32016 Second Processor.
</p>

<p>
Using a commercial board for this purpose is the best choice. Nevertheless the board is not ideal. For example it
lacks an Ethernet port and a real time clock. But it is cheap and the used FPGA is a modern one which will be available
for many years. The missing features can be added through the expansion connectors. I will develop the necessary
hardware for it too. 
</p>

<p>
The three computers to be integrated are very different from a software point of view. Having them available in one
system should be an exciting experience. The FPGA of the board is big enough to hold the required hardware.

<p>
Of course such a complex system is not build over night. But as time goes by the fourth milestone is now achieved
:-)

<h3>Milestone 4 : TRIPUTER V0.3 is available =&gt; updated to V0.33 again due to some issues in the VT100 terminal
emulation.</h3>

<p>
<b>Description:</b> version 0.33 of TRIPUTER contains the PC632M system running NetBSD with an SD card. Still this
system uses the USB connection for the RS232 interface. The image for the SD card is available at
<a href="http://cpu-ns32k.net/NetBSD.html">Software/NetBSD</a>. The <a href="http://cpu-ns32k.net/files/TRIPUTER_V033.zip">V0.33 zip archive</a>

The date of the zip-file is 11 May 2019.
</p>

<p><b>Status:</b> done.</p>

<h3>October 2019 : the PERI board is available!</h3>

<p>
The PERI board is an IO board which brings to the FPGA board some necessary extensions: a true RS232 interface,
a real time clock (RTC), two PS2 ports for mouse and keyboard, a second SD card connector and a 100 Mbit Ethernet
interface. All of these things are now operational. One port is not yet usable: SATA. The hardware is there, but
the verilog code for this challenging interface must still be written.
</p>

<p>
Figure 4 shows the PERI board in action.
</p>

<p><img src="http://cpu-ns32k.net/images/PERI.jpg"></p>
<p>Fig. 4. The PERI board with the serial number 1 is attached to the Cyclone V GX Starter Kit. 2 of the 3 LEDs of
the Ethernet interface are active.</p>

<p>
The purpose of PERI is to transform the Starter Kit into a standalone computer. Then all the planned systems can
be implemented.
</p>

<p>
To test the functions of the PERI board I have made a new version of TRIPUTER: it is V0.9 . The 
<a href="http://cpu-ns32k.net/files/TRIPUTER_V09.zip">V0.9 zip archive</a> contains only three files:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>TRIPUTER_V09.pof , the flash configuration
  </li><li>TRIPUTER_V09.pdf , the User Manual
  </li><li>monitor.32K , the source code of the TRIPUTER MONITOR program
</li></ul>

<p>
The system can only test PERI if the flash is being configured with the pof file. Then some software is available.
I hope that V0.9 will be replaced soon with a version which enables SATA...
</p>

<h3>Milestone 5 : TRIPUTER V1.0 is available.</h3>

<p>
<b>Description:</b> TRIPUTER V1.0 will be the first system that uses all features of the PERI board. It will emulate
the PC532, run NetBSD from a SATA device and will have an Ethernet interface for easy down- and uploading of big
files.
</p>

<p><b>Status:</b> to be done.</p>

<h3>Milestone 6 : TRIPUTER V2.0 is available.</h3>

<p>
<b>Description:</b> TRIPUTER V2.0 will contain the Ceres-3 and the PC532.
</p>

<p><b>Status:</b> to be done.</p>

<p>Real entrepreneurs ship, don’t ever forget that. An idea is worthless until it has been translated and executed into a tangible product that your potential customers can use. Getting from inception of an idea all the way to shipping it seems like a pretty straight forward process, but so is war- get guns, tanks, draw a strategy, invade, and take over. When you get caught up in the heat of a battle, I’m sure what seemed simple on the surface, isn’t so simple after all. Gunfire has a way of doing that. Shipping a product that customers want is kind of the same thing. The gunfire of confusion, resisting feature creep, and not having a defined process can make taking an idea from inception to shipping it terribly difficult. I was guilty of this with my first startup, Publictivity. <strong> Never ever again. </strong> I often get asked about the topic, so here’s the exact blueprint I follow. This is how I go about taking a product from inception all the way to shipping it as well as having paying customers lined up. I will use examples from two products I’m currently working on <a href="http://www.padpressed.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.PadPressed.com', ' PadPressed ']);"> PadPressed </a> (shipped, profitable, 100+ customers, and version two on its way) and <a href="http://flow.cloudomatic.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://flow.cloudomatic.com', 'Cloudomatic(flow) ']);">Cloudomatic(flow) </a> (early alpha testing, shipping soon for mass consumption, 150+ customers lined up for launch).</p>
<h2>Step 1: Define The Problem</h2>
<p>The biggest problem with ideas is the fact that they don’t really solve a problem. All too often entrepreneurs go about creating cool things that don’t solve a real problem. By defining the problem, it helps you clarify what you’re building and why. Defining the problem gives you constraints around feature creep. It lets you say “Does this feature or functionality add anything that is core to solving the problem?” You would be surprised how many features make it into products that have absolutely nothing to do with solving the problem.</p>
<p><strong> Example 1: </strong> I just bought my iPad, started blogging more heavily, and wanted to make sure my blog was optimized for the tablet format. I certainly wasn’t going to make a native iPad app. At first I thought I would just modify my existing theme by removing dropdowns, increasing the size of the font,etc. Well yeah, that did not work out too well. <strong> Problem: No easy way for publishers to make their content Tablet friendly using their existing CMS (in my case WordPress). </strong></p>
<p><strong> Example 2: </strong> We created Cloudomatic.com in a weekend. Revenue model was simple: drive traffic, integrate affiliate links, make a very nice commission as SaaS has a very nice ARPU. It turns out that very few SaaS developers had an affiliate program. As former SaaS guys ourselves, we looked around and understood why: existing stuff was too complex, didn’t work with subscription services, and devs were too busy to build it themselves. <strong> Problem: No easy way for web app developers to get setup with a simple affiliate program in under an hour. </strong></p>
<h2>Step 2: High Level Overview Specifications and Mockups</h2>
<p>At this point you probably know what you want to build and specifically what problem the app is meant to solve. From here you start to define the solution to the problem stated above. How will the app specifically solve this problem? What is the secret sauce? The high level specifications should be 1-2 pages at MOST. This is something that a normal human being should be able to read and define specific important features. It’s really the skeleton for the technical outline of your app. In short, it should be enough for photoshop mockups or even just wireframes created with Balsamiq.</p>
<p>When creating mockups and wireframes don’t focus on fleshing out every last detail or every last little screen ie- the reset password screen or some obscure settings page. Instead, pick maybe 4-5 different screens that show the key functionality of the app. You’re prepping yourself for initial customer feedback and validation, so pick the screens that are going to convince them and get the point across that your solution is solving the problem you have defined.</p>
<p><strong> Example 1: </strong> With <a href="http://www.padpressed.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.PadPressed.com', ' PadPressed ']);"> PadPressed </a>, I spent a fair amount of time looking at the native iPad applications major publishers had put out such as USA Today, BBC, Financial Times,etc. I also had a list of specific functionality that I knew was crucial. Simple page design, large fonts, accelerometer aware, touch navigation, swiping to advance were some of them. I also defined the way that integration should work with WordPress. This was more of a technical issue, but it was also key to adoption. For mockups I basically screenshotted from my iPad, photoshopped a bunch of different things together, and also took videos of the touch interactions that were key.</p>
<p><strong> Example 2: </strong> With <a href="http://flow.cloudomatic.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://flow.cloudomatic.com', ' Cloudomatic(flow) ']);"> Cloudomatic(flow) </a> we basically locked ourselves down for an entire weekend to get through steps 1-3. I defined everything that was needed from the both the developer standpoint and the affiliate end. From there we translated that into the 4 most important separate screens that had an overview of what the app would do- overview dashboard, define payment plans coordinated with your app, and what the interface looks like for an actual affiliate.</p>
<h2>Step 3: Initial Customer Feedback and Validation</h2>
<p>This is a really crucial step and it might be a really depressing or exciting step. At this point you now have something that you can show potential customers to have them say: “This is interesting, I would use it and/or would pay you for it.” You should probably synthesize the simple specs into some type of sales literature or at least something a normal person can read. The mockups should be fine as is. If you’re using wireframes, just explain that this is for feedback purposes only and a very rough idea of what is being built.</p>
<p><strong> Example 1: </strong> With <a href="http://www.padpressed.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.PadPressed.com', ' PadPressed ']);"> PadPressed </a> we kept things really rough and also took a risk by playing things close to the chest. We basically explained what the app would do in simple terms: Take your existing WordPress install, if a user accesses your blog from their iPad web browser, it behaves like a native iPad app. We highlighted major features that drove this point home and showed what were some God awful mockups. They were frankshops of many different apps we thought made sense, but it got the point across. Enough bloggers told us this would be useful and that they would pay for it. So we soldiered on.</p>
<p><strong> Example 2: </strong> <a href="http://flow.cloudomatic.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://flow.cloudomatic.com', ' Cloudomatic(flow) ']);"> Cloudomatic(flow) </a> was an interesting beast from this perspective. It went way better than we thought it would. This was a very public customer feedback/validation phase using what’s called an MVP smoke test ie- the product isn’t fully built, but gauge consumer feedback as if it is there. The goal was to see if we would get sign-ups, but we also indicated in the confirmation email that if you wanted to be fast tracked into the beta that you could email us indicating so. This let us do a few things a) see how badly some people wanted the product b) have some initial individuals we could reach out to in order to make sure we were building the most critical features first c) set priorities for sending out actual invites when the time came. The site at <a href="http://flow.cloudomatic.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://flow.cloudomatic.com', 'flow.cloudomatic.com ']);">flow.cloudomatic.com </a>is the same exact site, screenshots,etc. that we used for this phase if you want to see what was actually there.</p>
<h2>Step 4: Be An Axe Murderer</h2>
<p>Guess what? You’re probably doing too much even with the simple initial spec and mockups that you put together. Besides validating the problem and your specific solution, talking to potential customers allows you to find out which features are really crucial and which ones are nice to have. Start killing off things you don’t need right away and leave them to Version 1.1,etc., but also make sure the really important ones have a very high priority. By doing this, your app will be left to the most core and essential features. This will make it easier to get the product in the hands of your customers AND it will also make you laser focused on the things that truly matter to your customers.</p>
<p><strong> Example 1: </strong> With <a href="http://www.padpressed.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.PadPressed.com', ' PadPressed ']);"> PadPressed </a> we kept the features that stuck with the core vision of making the app feel native as opposed to adding things that would have been publisher/blogging specific. We don’t have comments right now and probably won’t until we can do them right to integrate with the experience. We could have easily just included the comment div, but it wasn’t worth keeping a half assed feature.</p>
<p><strong> Example 2: </strong> Cloudomatic(flow) is really really simple. We reduced it down to a few API calls and a Javascript embed. There are a lot of features we’ll add in the future for conversions, advanced affiliate management, reseller management,etc. We basically only went with features that focused on the core problem at hand: a) Specifically working with recurring subscriptions for SaaS b) Making integration take less than an hour for SaaS developers by reducing things to a few simple API calls. We also reduced the payout options from every provider under the sun to the most requested one: PayPal</p>
<h2>Step 5: Detailed Specifications</h2>
<p>Detailed specs are like your blueprint for the app, and shouldn’t be rushed. You can’t think of every scenario until you start building + testing it, but you can certainly try. When you’re working with a multiperson team, you don’t have time to wait for email responses, second guess, or hold things up. If it’s in the specs, you know where to go. It also helps keep scope creep away. My specs also include the database structure and design as well.</p>
<p><strong> Example 1: </strong> <a href="http://www.padpressed.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.PadPressed.com', ' PadPressed’s ']);"> …</a></p></section></article></div></div>

<p>At some point we had an issue with application startup performance.
For a bit of context this app runs in a Kubernetes cluster, with k8s it’s possible
to define a <em>rollout policy</em> to avoid service distruption, that what we had, so there’s a
rollout, new pods (a pod is composed of the application container) get created,
new application are started, then Kubernetes has a mean to check when the application is
<strong>ready</strong>, it’s called the readyness probe. This probe can be a call to http endpoint or a script,
ours is an HTTP endpoint.</p>
<p>WHen the probe indicates the application is ready, the application starts receiving traffic,
from this moment latencies increased from 10-20 milliseconds to seconds.</p>
<p>Opening the recording JMC, it will start an automated analysis. Sometime it’s helpful
and warning should be looked at. In this case the issue was elsewhere.</p>
<p>To help in our case, we need to go in the thread view, which as a <em>thread lanes</em>
which displays each thread as an horizontal bar, and JFR event are painted on the bar
at the time they happened and for how long. At the bottom there’s a the time axis.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-0-thread-lanes.png" alt="startup 0 thread lanes">
</p>
<p>Thread Lanes</p>
</div>
<p>The first things that catch our eyes will be the vertical patterns, especially the one with
yellow and red around 12:51:15. Let’s zoom (you can select and right click, or use arrow keys.).</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-0-threads-lanes-closer.png" alt="startup 0 threads lanes closer">
</p>
<p>Zooming on the problematic</p>
</div>
<p>The vertical pattern is more precise, these vertical pattern indicates a <em>cross
threads phenomena</em>. And we can notice that all thread are not affected the same way.</p>
<p>The lanes in green at the top indicates these threads are progressing normally, nothing’s
wrong with them. However is we go down there especially, the pattern materialize around
12:51:11.</p>
<p>Each color indicate some events</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Gray ⇒ the thread does nothing, it’s parked</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Small dark point ⇒ The park event, the thread was scheduled but was eventually parked</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Red ⇒ In this case it’s a <em>blocked lock</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yellow ⇒ Here the yellow events that intrests us are thread waiting on a lock</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>I’m not well versed in desfribing colors, so know that there are other events that use
a slightly different tone / shade of red, yellow or else. Just click on the event
to see what’s going on.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-1-threads-jedis-lock-event.png" alt="startup 1 threads jedis lock event">
</p>
<p>monitor blocked</p>
</div>
<p>The UI could be improved but going over the events shows a popup with it’s details,
for the Monitor Blocked event, there’s the duration this monitor was block, who held
this monitor before, and the monitor address in the heap.</p>
<p>This monitor was held for ~9s, that’s a big bottleneck !</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-1-threads-jedis-monitor-acquire-blocked.png" alt="startup 1 threads jedis monitor acquire blocked">
</p>
</div>
<p>In this case we had ~200 thread competing for this lock in particular. And finding the thread that
acquired it is not automated, it’s a bit tedious, but in the end didn’t revealed anything.</p>
<p>However the Monitor Blocked event has another interesting element, the stacktrace. In the lower
pane of JMC, if the event is selected, we can see the stack trace where this event was emmitted.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-1-threads-jedis-monitor-blocked-stack.png" alt="startup 1 threads jedis monitor blocked stack">
</p>
<p>jedis classloading</p>
</div>
<p>Here that’s the JDK classloader. I would never have thought that the JDK code would cause ~9s
contention. But looking at the stacktrace, there <em>jedis</em> (a Redis client) connection pool involved.
Maybe the class have static initialization that does IO, maybe it’s the agent that runs in production
that introduces latencies during this specific classlaoding.</p>
<p>But all the threads starts working again around 12:51:22, and redis bottle neck is not anymore an issue
afterward. Let’s look at the story on the IO side, open the Socket IO view.</p>
<p>Identify which one is related to redis, either via IP or via port (Redis is <code>6379</code>).</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-1-socketio-redis-port.png" alt="startup 1 socketio redis port">
</p>
<p>Socket IO with redis port selected</p>
</div>
<p>While we see a total time of 30s, it’s the accumulated time for all thread for the recording duration (6m).
So nothing fancy here. However we see that actual IO happens really late, around 12:51:22.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-1-socketio-redis.png" alt="startup 1 socketio redis">
</p>
<p>Socket IO actual Redis read / write</p>
</div>
<p>I’m not sure of the cause, we can definitely rule out Redis, the is either in the network, during
connection establishment, or actually during classloading.</p>
<p>In order to remediate that, we noticed this code is called once the application is ready.
So in order to avoid the contention the code was changed to pre-connect to redis during the
application startup before the the application is considedred ready. And it worked, this
specific issue disappeared.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-2-thread-lanes.png" alt="startup 2 thread lanes">
</p>
</div>
<p>However as knew from the first recording, and now the second iteration this was not the only issue
identified when flying over the yellow and red events.</p>

<p>All the stacktraces above have one thing in common, a contention on a lock.
As thread were blocked, and new request appeared, this had the effects of increase the
queuing, and made tomcat creates new <em>http nio</em> worked threads until the maximum is reached
(200 by default). I applied the same trick: i.e before readyness, exercise code paths that
are lazy initialized. And it worked too. Most contention disappeared afterward.</p>

</p>
<p>Better startup / C2 compiler event</p>
</div>
<p>There was still some potential gain however. We noticed a few C2 compiler events,
If you don’t know C1 and C2, it’s the compilers that transform bytecode to assembly.
While C1 is somewhat superficial in optimizing the assembly, but it requires few
CPU and it allows code to be executed asap yet not as efficient as possible. In a
second phase C2 may kick in, this one outputs highly optimized code for hot code path
(code that is executed very, very often), but it requires resources.</p>
<p>Note this compilation event is not blocking threads !</p>
<p>As an experiment I decided to use the Graal compiler, which I believe is the new
generation of compiler. <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/compiler/README.md">Graal compiler</a>
is part of the <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal">GraalVM</a> project.
It ships as an experimental option : <code>-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseJVMCICompiler</code>.</p>
<p>And the result for this work load in particular.</p>

<p>This graph is falling under the <a href="https://latencytipoftheday.blogspot.com/2014/06/latencytipoftheday-most-page-loads.html"><em>percentlie</em></a>
but the improvement is still visible.</p>
<p>Now when we analyzed the new profile we noticed that JVM was using a lot of time to
revoke bias locking. Note the events in fushia are custom JFR events that track HTTP requests.
(<a href="https://twitter.com/gunnarmorling">Gunnar Morling</a> has an inspiring
<a href="https://www.morling.dev/blog/rest-api-monitoring-with-custom-jdk-flight-recorder-events/">write up</a> about it).</p>
<p>This VM operation is done during safepoint during which the JVM is paused. At this time a lot of
of bias revocation event appears, so we removed them, and it works too.</p>

</p>
<p>Revoke Bias locking</p>
</div>
<p>The graphic below shows the difference in startup time. Other consuming backend services had to timeout
and eventually perform retries during rollouts which increased the pressure on the application.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-5-before-after.png" alt="startup 5 before after">
</p>
<p>Before ⇒ after</p>
</div>
<p>Other smaller issues could be discovered and tackled, for example I noticed a few gaps
200ms wide at 30/1min intervals that were related to GC pauses.</p>
<div>
<p>GC gaps</p>
<p><span><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-9-gc-pause-1.png" alt="startup 9 gc pause 1" title="GC gap 1"></span> <span><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-9-gc-pause-2.png" alt="startup 9 gc pause 2" title="GC gap 2"></span></p>
</div>
<p>For this application the GC is working within 20ms excepts for a few larger pauses
during the early minutes of startup:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-9-thread-lanes-gc-pauses-effect.png" alt="startup 9 thread lanes gc pauses effect">
</p>
<p>GC pauses causes new HTTP worker threads</p>
</div>
<p>Tuning GC is out of scope for this article, but JMC presents a nice view that could help identify GC
causes. In my opinion it’s currently a bit less powerful as GC logs because GC events lack
useful information only found in GC logs with appropriate tags and level.</p>

</div>
<p>Anyway from there we could imagine a <em>setting</em> file in the JDK dedicated for GC events.
Instead of parsing log files whose <em>string format</em> that may change a bit over releases
(even with unified logging) GC events could be analyzed leveraging the included JFR schema.</p>
<p>Also with JFR, it’s even possible to record memory leak using the <code>profile</code> <em>settings</em> file,
I never tried that in a real situation though, but if this avoids the need to make a heap dump
and parse it then I’m all in.</p>

The consequences of our testing the limits of our natural habitat are playing out today, poised to speed up and multiply.</p><p>The impacts of a warming world, today, are accelerating, compounding, and exacerbating.&nbsp;</p><p>Season after season, the societal toll of climate change is precipitated by climate-related natural disasters. The frequency and variability of these events are outstripping our ability to mitigate its source -- greenhouse gas emissions -- and our ability to adapt to the heightened risk.</p><h4><strong>Accounting for the Damage</strong></h4><p>Climate change is here, now. Natural disasters around the world <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-insurance-disasters/forest-fire-insurance-costs-soar-idUKKCN1P2129"><span>caused</span></a> $160 billion in economic damages in 2018. Devastating storms in the Gulf of the U.S. or the coast of Japan have led to lives lost and economic destruction of <a href="http://www.cityam.com/271984/natural-catastrophes-led-more-than-half-trillion-pounds"><span>upward of</span></a> $650 billion over two years. Global human displacement is seeing new highs in the Asia Pacific region, with <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/world/factbox-asia-pacific-worlds-most-disaster-prone-region">60 million people displaced</a> from 2013 and 2015 alone. This is an area where nearly a billion people are <a href="https://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/2015_Year%20in%20Review_final_PDF_1.pdf"><span>expected</span></a> to live by 2030.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595759604616_6108"><div><h4><strong>Fuel to the Fire</strong></h4><p>The U.S. Department of Defense <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Explore/News/Article/Article/603440/"><span>called</span></a> climate change a “threat multiplier.” There are no countries immune to its effects. No clearer was this exemplified than during the Syrian Civil War in 2011. A series of droughts in the region <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0962629816301822"><span>led to</span></a> large scale migration of young men to the country’s cities. The socio-economic stresses already present were exacerbated by the influx. Less rainfall and prolonged drought in East Africa causing further entrenched conflicts over natural resources is also representative of how anthropogenic climate change is fueling the fire of conflict.</p><p>A study by the Pentagon last year <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-18/in-dire-report-pentagon-warns-bases-imperiled-by-climate-change"><span>warned</span></a> of the link between climate change, war, and migration -- confirming that global temperature rise has and will fuel conflict and refugees. A few months later, Rod Schoonover, a member of the White House National Security Council, spoke to the Senate in June 2019, and explained:</p><p>“No country will be immune to the effect of climate change over the next 20 years, but some will be able to cope, adapt, or respond more effectively than others. […] Local problems could spillover with global consequences, such as through increased human displacement, natural resource disputes, commodity price volatility” […] “Climate change effects could undermine important international systems on which the U.S. and its partners are critically dependent, such as trade routes, food and energy supplies, the global economy, and domestic stability abroad.”</p><h4><strong>Risks to Come</strong></h4><p>There are also other risks that have only begun to be accounted for. Those that are often unforeseen but inescapable in an interconnected world.</p><p>For one, the management of corporate supply chains in an accelerating transition to renewable energy and disruptive changes to consumer habits will lead to economic collisions. It is not only the impact of destabilizing production sources in geographies vulnerable to physical climate disruptions. The prices of goods will also need to be stabilized in the open market as the financial industry, like pension funds, shift capital to ESG-pegged investments.</p><p>As an example, Coca Cola saw its balance sheets <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/24/science/earth/threat-to-bottom-line-spurs-action-on-climate.html?ref=business"><span>endangered by droughts</span></a> that reduced water availability needed to produce its soda, a risk they recognize will magnify. Nike has also sounded the alarm in its supply chain management due to the increase of tropical storms hitting its factories that mostly reside in Southeast Asia. Four Nike factories in Thailand had to shut down in 2008 due to floods.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595762628047_9013"><div><h4><strong>Canary in the Coal Mine</strong></h4><p>The thawing of permafrost and retreating sea ice in the Arctic has been said to be the “canary in the coal mine” of the climate crisis. That’s because the gradual and dramatic physical changes to this area of the Northern Hemisphere are more immediate and detrimental as temperature increase here <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar4/syr/">happens twice as fast</a> as everywhere else.</p><p>The cryosphere&nbsp; -- the frozen water part of the Earth system -- is the first place we expect to see impacts of climate change. Sea ice in the Arctic follows a seasonal cycle with minimums in September and maximums in February and March. Ice sheets’ equilibrium of snow during the winter and melt during the summer is tipping. What happens next is a change in glacier length affecting ecosystems and water resources and a change in global sea level (i.e., the volume of ocean water and volume of the ocean basins).</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595761665845_7869"><div><p>The Paris Agreement of 2015 asked that countries limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, with the aim of keeping the temperature below 1.5 degrees Celsius to avoid the most devastating consequences of climate change.</p><p>Collective action is indispensable if we are to adequately rein in emissions to meet those targets. Understanding the interconnectedness and fragility of our natural and economic systems should prompt a sense of responsibility. Understanding the climate crisis, and our direct experience with it is a way to break through its absence and minimization in the national discourse. It should prompt us to vote, fund, and work on the solutions.</p></div></div></div>]]>

        <p><em>(This post was originally written as a reply on the mailop mailing-list, but
a friend asked me to turn it into a blog post.  I've edited it, mostly
adding more links to elsewhere, but there are some additions here.)</em></p>
<p><em>Context: someone with a mail-server hosted in a German facility with a
poor reputation for handling abuse reports was asking for help on
sending email to their Gmail-using friends; they had SPF and didn't see
the point of DKIM; they had TLS setup for their mail-server, using a
certificate from CACert.</em></p>
<p>There's a PDF from Google from 2006 which is still worth reading:
<a href="https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/45.pdf">https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/45.pdf</a>, entitled
“Sender Reputation in a Large Webmail Service” by Bradley Taylor.
Anyone running a mail-server today needs to read that document.</p>
<p>If you don't send much email, then the only IP-based reputation which
Google can assess you on is the reputation of your address-block, so
being in a “troublesome” hosting provider will score heavily against
you.  At that point, if not moving away, you need to try to balance out
that negative score with enough positives that any of the large
providers using reputation scoring will accept the mail.</p>
<p>Working forward-and-reverse paired DNS is even more important for IPv6
than for IPv4; for better or worse, some of the large providers have
decided that exemptions in old standards for old behavior should not
apply when folks deploy standards which are far newer.  So you
absolutely need an <code>MX</code> record, you must not just rely upon
address-records (<code>A</code> and <code>AAAA</code>).</p>
<p>With a poor IP-based reputation, you need to see if you can score a
better domain-based reputation.  This is where DKIM comes into play:
once you can provably link a message to really be from a given domain,
then even if you don't send much mail you can benefit from stuff like
“not on day-old-bread domain-lists”.  But having DKIM and then a DMARC
record does help (and <a href="https://bridge.grumpy-troll.org/2014/04/dmarc-stance/">I'm no fan of DMARC</a>).</p>
<p>For the mail-server's TLS: for that to count in your favor instead of
being a wash, I strongly suspect that it needs to be a certificate which
senders can verify.  For those people scoring up for “better TLS”, those
senders using DANE will be happy with a TLSA record in DNSSEC for your
CACert anchor.  But the large webmail providers are Resistant to having
to deploy DNSSEC verification, so instead have pushed out an alternative
called MTA-STS.  With MTA-STS, you're tied into “whichever subset of CAs
all the large senders you care about will trust”, and then using that CA
for the certificates both for the MTA-STS web-server and for your
mail-server.  Note that you don't need to implement the client logic for
MTA-STS (and I think it's antithetical to an open federated platform)
but do need to just publish the static information for those senders who
do use it. At that point, CACert is not going to cut it.  You'd need to
try Let's Encrypt instead.</p>
<p>The ongoing natural tendency from larger providers is to favor
supporting what the majority of their users want the majority of the
time.  With so many people using larger providers, they naturally tilt
towards stuff which works with the larger senders, and requiring more
hoops.  Those additional hoops create more work for smaller providers
and self-hosters doing thing manually.</p>
<p>We need better automation tools around all of this.  The below will make
it clearer why.</p>
<p>So, here is my current understanding of the best current practices here,
in reality not IETF idealism.  This includes making mandatory stuff
which some folks insist must be optional, because realistically to send
to some large providers it's not optional.  This list includes features
to make you compatible with ongoing trends in the EU (particularly
Germany) to strongly disfavor allowing clear-text SMTP.</p>
<p>This assumes that you are <em>not</em> a large sender who should also be
setting up feedback loops, learning how to “warm” IPs, considering BIMI,
postmaster tooling domain verification, etc.</p>
<h3 id="deliverability-fixes">Deliverability fixes</h3>
<ol>
<li>reverse DNS with matching forward DNS; the name used should not
pattern-match anything generic and ideally would include a DNS label
of <code>mail</code> or <code>mx</code> or the like in it.</li>
<li>MX record, always.</li>
<li>Accurate SPF;
<ul>
<li>ideally not too broad; pay attention to SPF's query limits.</li>
<li>avoid <code>-all</code> at the end because, with the sole exception of “this
domain never sends email” records, the larger operators have metrics to
show that using <code>-all</code> <em>tends</em> to be a sign of over-enthusiasm rather
than reality, so it will slightly count against you;</li>
<li>remember to have an SPF record for your <code>HELO</code> hostname, because
when you send a “bounce” rejection, this is the thing which will be
looked up (since there's no domain in <code>&lt;&gt;</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DKIM set up, with thought towards the selector namespace.
<ul>
<li>RSA2048 key is effectively a hard-requirement
<ul>
<li>DNS TXT records consist of one or more DNS strings, each of which
is limited to 255 ASCII characters.  For a key of this size, you
will end up needing two DNS strings in the zonefile.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ed25519 keys are not yet widely supported, but by now are not
likely to actively break and make things worse for you, if you
dual-sign.  This needs to be a different selector.</li>
<li>Note that for various good reasons you should design this to be
something you routinely rotate.
<ul>
<li>Some folks use yearly, some monthly</li>
<li>I rotate every three months.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DMARC record; see <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7489" title="Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC)">RFC 7489</a>
<ul>
<li>But for domains which humans send from <em>don't</em> use
<code>p=quarantine</code> or <code>p=reject</code>;</li>
<li>Do consider setting up a receiver for reports, just so that you can
see how much of a privacy breach DMARC reporting is when you send
to mailing-lists which don't re-sign. :-/</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>TLS certificate from a CA in the main trust anchor bundles;
<ul>
<li>Just use Let's Encrypt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MTA-STS web-server with HTTPS certificate from the same CA, and the
relevant MTA-STS txt file in place; add the DNS record when it's up
and happy.  See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8461" title="SMTP MTA Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS)">RFC 8461</a>.
<ul>
<li>See <a href="https://esmtp.email/tools/mta-sts/">https://esmtp.email/tools/mta-sts/</a> for a testing validation tool
(with thanks to Luis Muñoz for the pointer).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For the independent mail providers using the stuff broadly supported
in open source MTAs, you should look at DNSSEC, because the patterns
here are less susceptible to rent-seeking pressures:
<ul>
<li>DNSSEC-signed zone for your own domain
<ul>
<li>Use whichever signing algorithm CloudFlare are currently using:
this should be both current for cryptography and widely enough
supported that if it's not supported by someone's resolver, then
they have bigger problems than just your domain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DNSSEC validating resolver for you to look up records of others
(consider <a href="https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/">Unbound</a> or <a href="https://www.knot-resolver.cz/">Knot Resolver</a>)</li>
<li>DANE records for your own domain (TLSA records in DNS)
<ul>
<li>See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7672" title="SMTP Security via Opportunistic DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) Transport Layer Security (TLS)">RFC 7672</a> for the SMTP details.</li>
<li>See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6698" title="The DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol: TLSA">RFC 6698</a> for the base spec with <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7218" title="Adding Acronyms to Simplify Conversations about DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE)">RFC 7218</a> for some common
acronyms which make talking about it easier.</li>
<li>See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7671" title="The DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) Protocol: Updates and Operational Guidance">RFC 7671</a> for the updates and operational guidance.</li>
<li>There are other RFCs, for SRV records and for OpenPGP, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tell your mail-server to obey DANE stuff, so that if there's a TLSA
record in DNSSEC-verified DNS then the mail-server can disable
fallback to cleartext for delivery to MX (and ideally also then
verify the TLS connection has a cert chain which is anchored in one
of the TLSA records)</li>
<li><a href="https://dnsviz.net/">https://dnsviz.net</a> is your friend</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>_smtp._tls</code> record so you can get reports of TLS failures sending to
you</li>
<li>Seeing if you can get your IP onto one of the open DNS-based
allow-lists (also called “whitelists” but some folks are moving away
from that term), such as <a href="https://www.dnswl.org/">https://www.dnswl.org/</a> or Spamhaus's SWL.</li>
<li>Periodically check if you appear in any DNS-based deny-lists.</li>
<li>Make sure you're not sending from “ISP residential address-space”; if
need be route your mail outbound via a host in better address-space
(and update SPF etc to match)</li>
<li>Don't do sender call-out verification to SMTP servers which aren't
yours.</li>
<li>For your own sanity, do make sure you set up <a href="https://www.fail2ban.org/">fail2ban</a>, or something
like it, scanning your mail-server logs, because SMTP AUTH online
cracking is widespread.  If they ever get in, your deliverability
will be negatively impacted by their spam campaign through your
mail-server.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="convenience-stuff">Convenience Stuff</h3>
<p>Outside of “Phil's BCP” above, additional non-deliverability but
convenience options include:</p>
<ol>
<li>DNS SRV records for submission(s)/imap(s)/pop3(s)/sieve, even if just
to say with «<code>0 0 0 .</code>» that it's not supported.</li>
<li>If your communications base includes people using OpenPGP with email,
then set up WKD to publish OpenPGP keys for your domain too.
<ul>
<li>This is just a fixed schema for laying out keys for HTTPS retrieval.</li>
<li>See the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-koch-openpgp-webkey-service/?include_text=1" title="OpenPGP Web Key Directory">WKD draft</a> for details.</li>
<li>I wrote <a href="https://github.com/PennockTech/openpgpkey-control">https://github.com/PennockTech/openpgpkey-control</a> as a
management framework for an organization; the
<code>other/standalone-update-website</code> script is designed to be
embeddable into an existing site-building workflow without anything
else from the repository.</li>
<li>The GnuPG project has tooling available which manages the WKD layout as
an email-integrated workflow, for people to update their own keys.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If your communications base includes people using S/MIME then set up
SMIMEA records in your DNSSEC-signed DNS.
<ul>
<li>They look a lot like TLSA records; both are trust anchors in DNS.</li>
<li>See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8162" title="Using Secure DNS to Associate Certificates with Domain Names for S/MIME">RFC 8162</a> for details.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The moment you start specifying “must be TLS-secured” it's worth
adding <code>CAA</code> records into DNS, so that Certificate Authorities which
are broadly trusted will refuse to issue for your domain unless you
list them.
<ul>
<li>See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8659" title="DNS Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) Resource Record">RFC 8659</a> for details</li>
<li>The values checked by each Certificate Authority as indicating they
have permission are required to be listed in their Certification
Practice Statement, as part of the CA/Browser forum's Baseline
Requirements.  If it's missing, then browsers are not supposed to
be trusting that CA.</li>
<li>For domain-validation CAs such as Let's Encrypt, consider adding
account information to those records to tie it to your specific
account.  See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8657" title="Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) Record Extensions for Account URI and Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) Method Binding">RFC 8657</a> for details.</li>
<li>Beware that at time of writing, Let's Encrypt only honors the
<code>accounturi</code> restriction in their staging environment, not their
production setup; this will likely change.</li>
<li>Remember that DNS zonefiles support comments.  You'll want them</li></ul></li></ol></article></main></div></div>

Earlier we had <a href="https://androidrookies.com/telegram-developer-wants-a-law-to-make-apple-allow-iphone-users-to-install-apps-from-other-app-stores/">Pavel Durov of Telegram</a> who wanted legislation enacted to make Apple allow iPhone to install independent Apps stores. Now, Epic Games CEO, Tim Sweeney has joined the crowd.</p><p>Sweeney castigated both Apple and Google for their monopolistic App store policies. Both Apple and Google charge a 30% commission from developers offering paid/premium or in-App services. Sweeney says that both the tech giants have<span> built app stores that are entirely based on the idea of monopoly.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Sweeney called Apple an <strong>absolute monopoly</strong>.&nbsp;In an interview with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/24/epic-games-ceo-tim-sweeney-apple-crippled-app-store-with-30percent-cut.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CNBC</a>, Sweeney says Apple has invented “an absolute monopoly,” while Google crushes competition stores with “UI barriers.” He says that the 30% fee charged by both Apple and Google are unrealistic and emphasized that these charges only&nbsp;increase the price of the apps and games.</p><p>Epic Games has a bad history with App stores, especially with Google Play Store. It had earlier Fortnite for Android smartphone as an APK to beat Google’s 30% commission fees. However, when Fortnite players complained that installing the APK was too complicated, Epic Games relented and published it on <a title="Google Play" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.epicgames.fortnite&amp;hl=en_IN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Store</a> paying Google the 30% commission as mandated.</p><p>“Google essentially intentionally stifles competing stores by having user interface barriers and obstruction. If every developer could accept their own payments and avoid the 30% tax by Apple and Google we could pass the savings along to all our consumers and players would get a better deal on items. And you’d have economic competition,” Sweeney told CNBC.</p><p>He was also very fierce on Apple. “Apple has locked down and crippled the ecosystem by inventing an absolute monopoly on the distribution of software, on the monetization of software,” Sweeney told CNBC’s Julia Boorstin.</p><p>This is not the first time Sweeney has lashed out against Google. In <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/02/12/tim-sweeney-android-is-a-fake-open-system-and-ios-is-worse/">February 2020</a> during a keynote address to the DICE Summit game event in Las Vegas, he had called Google’s Android a “fake open system” for putting up barriers in front of users.</p><p>The representatives of tech giants, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, will be testifying in a <a href="https://androidrookies.com/jeff-bezos-tim-cook-mark-zuckerberg-sunder-pichai-to-testify-in-u-s-antitrust-hearing-on-july-27/">Congress hearing</a> for their anti-trust behavior. <a href="https://androidrookies.com/microsoft-complains-about-apples-30-commission-from-app-developers-during-private-anti-trust-meeting/">Brad Smith, President and Legal Officer of Microsoft</a> has already had a private meeting with the anti-trust committee members in which he complained about Apple’s App store commission.</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

<p>If you try to deploy a new release of Clojure library with
<a href="https://leiningen.org/">Leiningen</a>, it prompts you to sign the .jar file with GPG. This step
often causes confusion and breaks. I believe that it’s not worth the effort to
make it work.</p>
<p>As far as I know, <em>nobody ever verifies the signatures</em> in a systematic way.
There are a bunch of obstacles:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s unclear if any tools for verifying the signatures actually work. For
example, I just tried to run <code>lein deps :verify</code> against a couple of projects
and it reported every dependency as <code>:unsigned</code>. I know that some of those
dependencies are signed and I verified that the <code>.asc</code> files exist on
repo.clojars.org.</li>
<li>It’s hard to find the public keys for the library maintainers. Sometimes they
upload them on the keyservers, sometimes not.</li>
<li>There’s no established way of communicating that which public keys should be
trusted. If there’s a new release and it has been made with a new key, your
best bet is to e-mail the maintainer and ask what is up.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s hard to get any security benefits from the signatures in practice. Thus
it’s okay to set <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/998d373ae06d17234efffde761fae93242c736fa/sample.project.clj#L111"><code>:sign-releases</code></a> to <code>false</code> in your
project.clj even if Leiningen’s manual does not recommend it.</p>
<hr>
<p>In princple, the systematic checking of signatures could provide security
against a dangerous supply-chain attack: weak or leaked passwords for package
manager accounts. For example, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/08/the-year-long-rash-of-supply-chain-attacks-against-open-source-is-getting-worse/">several RubyGems</a> have been attacked
this way. Most likely the signing keys would not be compromised at the same
time.</p>
<p>There are alternative solutions, though, such as disallowing publishing packages
without multi-factor authentication. Using Clojars’s <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/clojure/GmAU4XwnRpw">deploy tokens</a>
helps a bit as well.</p>
<p>Right now we place a lot of trust on Clojars and Maven Central. If either of
them got compromised, we all would be screwed. Package signing could be a part
of a solution to mitigate that risk, but a comprehensive solution would be
something like using <a href="https://theupdateframework.io/">The Update Framework</a>. Go’s <a href="https://blog.golang.org/module-mirror-launch">checksum
database</a> is also worth taking look at.</p>
<p>Finally, if you’re moved to do something about this, please do not build
anything new using PGP. To quote Latacora: <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html">PGP is bad and needs to go
away</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’ve written this post in part to be proven wrong. I’m eagerly waiting for posts
from y’all about how you do, in fact, systematically verify the signatures.</p>

                    <p>As COVID-19 continues to alter the way we live, there is a scramble to predict what our “new normal” will look like. After the virus fades away or, God help us, becomes a constant in our day-to-day life for years to come, which change brought on by the pandemic will stick? </p><p>There is one consensus prediction that is emerging, especially among knowledge workers and those in tech: The distributed workforce is here to stay. And, furthermore, this change is a good thing for workers and welcomed by all.</p><p>To which I say: Um, have you ever worked remotely?</p><p>I have understood and enjoyed the perks of working remotely before. From 2009 to 2016 I wrote about entrepreneurs and creatives, many of whom were early proponents of remote work. And from 2017 to 2019, I worked remotely for a small, privately-owned e-learning company and then a 1000-employee SaaS company. </p><p>While the upsides to remote work are true, for many people remote work is a poison pill — one where you are given “control” in the name of productivity in exchange for some pretty nasty long-term effects.</p><p><strong>In reality, remote work makes you vulnerable to outsourcing, reduces your job to a metric, creates frustrating change-averse bureaucracies, and stifles your career growth.</strong> The lack of scrutiny our remote future faces is going to result in frustrated workers and ineffective companies.</p><p>Let’s tackle these issues one at a time. </p><h2 id="remote-work-democratizes-talent-for-everyone-even-you-">Remote work “democratizes talent” for everyone. Even you.</h2><p>In May 2020, <a href="https://blogs.gartner.com/manjunath-bhat/2020/05/03/remote-work-is-the-next-big-equalizer/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">a Gartner blog post</a> summarized a common argument in favor of remote work: “Democratizing access to resources lowers the barriers to innovation and enables everybody to partake in the ensuing prosperity.” Not everyone can (or wants to) live in an urban commercial hub. Remote work, the thinking goes, allows people to live in whatever environment they’d like — depending on their own circumstances.</p><p>These remote technology jobs don’t just go to a version of you living on a cute farm in the Hudson Valley. Those jobs go to <em>anyone, anywhere.</em> </p><p>This is good for global prosperity and perhaps arguably inevitable. However, if you’re working in technology today as an American, you have tremendous earning potential. This earning potential may not be possible forever. It’s baffling to me that American workers would cheer an acceleration of this trend that would place downward pressure on their wages.</p><p>When you, the American worker, share this belief you are being blinded by an erroneous belief in American exceptionalism. When your company goes all-remote, it is starting a clock that ends in you eventually competing with the global talent market — especially if travel and visas continue to be restricted by the federal government.</p><p>A tech optimist will likely (and correctly) point out that more innovation and new technologies will replace any outsourced jobs. While my academic brain wants that to be true, I can’t help but see the devastating effects globalization had to our manufacturing workers and communities — many of which have never recovered or benefited from new innovations.</p><p>Innovation in the American economy didn’t get transferred one-to-one. Every manufacturing worker did not suddenly receive a tech job. Every technology worker outsourced will not receive the benefit of the next wave of innovation directly. </p><h2 id="remote-enables-you-to-be-forgotten">Remote enables you to be forgotten</h2><p>Remote work advocates often praise the focus that remote work enables. No longer will you be judged by the time you spend at the office, they say, you’ll instead be judged and rewarded on whether you “get things done.” </p><p>These “benefits” are always used to sell remote work to an imagined audience of Dilbert-like cubicle dwellers who are imprisoned and subjected by annoying coworkers and an oppressive boss. The key to freedom, they say, is to work remotely. Basecamp co-founder Jason Fried <a href="https://www.inc.com/jason-fried/excerpt-remote-workers-boost-quality.html" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">writes in <em>Remote</em></a>:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote darkmode="" data-title="Working%20From%20Home%20Boosts%20The%20Quality%20Of%20The%20Work" data-author="Jason Fried&nbsp;" cite="https://www.inc.com/jason-fried/excerpt-remote-workers-boost-quality.html">
                      <p>What you're left with is "what did this person actually do today?" Not "when did they get in?" or "how late did they stay?" Instead it's all about the work produced. So instead of asking a remote worker "what did you do today?" you can now just say, "Show me what you did today." As a manager, you can directly evaluate the work--the thing you're paying this person for--and ignore all the stuff that doesn't actually matter.</p>
                      
                      </blockquote>
                      <!--kg-card-end: html--><p>First, being more productive isn’t the only goal of working, but let’s put that to the side. Second, Fried is right, you do gain a bit of freedom from your boss (which doubles as a loss of a mentor, but we’ll get to that). You also gain “freedom” from your colleagues and collaborators. Which means you’re effectively on your own. </p><p>This is empowering to some, but the isolation can mean your contributions are easily overlooked or misunderstood. As a result, I’ve noticed a disturbing trend at (especially larger) remote companies: Some managers often have no clue what their direct reports are doing and how they are doing it. </p><p>Performance reviews are difficult enough under normal circumstances. But how do you judge someone when you can only see their output and never their process? Marketers, project managers, product managers, growth marketers, and others spend their days supporting or maintaining existing things. &nbsp;</p><p>This a difficult problem that predates any shift to remote work. But when applied to remote work, a manager loses several of the inputs needed to judge a direct report’s output — including, yes, who is physically (and mentally) present when actual work is being done. But also: Do the other team members appear to enjoy working with this person? And, if they are struggling, is it due to a lack of effort/focus or something outside of their control? </p><p>Employees who “do the right thing” spending extra time and energy supporting their teammates receive absolutely no recognition for doing the little things needed for a smooth-running, collaborative organization. It’s usually a quantifiable fact whether a sales departments reaches their goals. It’s not as clear that the social media manager had a good quarter.</p><p>With the removed context of a real-life office, your team’s output is difficult to individualize for your manager — especially if work is done in private DMs or one-on-one Zoom calls. The manager sees the end product with no visibility as to who did what, who pulled their weight, who made tough choices, and who made things more difficult. This has a nasty side effect of the leader viewing you less as a person who they have to empathize with and understand — and more as a talking head on a Zoom call or Slack who does things for them. </p><p>This will cause your work to “flatten.” Whatever soft skills you bring to the table will be minimized when working remotely. This will lead to companies and processes relying less on things like creativity and collaboration and more on simple inputs and outputs. Which, again, makes your work easier to outsource.</p><p>We bemoan the loss of empathy and context created by solely getting our news and interacting via social media … and we then turn around and set up our working lives in their image.</p><p>This has a pronounced effect in large organizations.</p><h2 id="remote-work-breaks-large-companies">Remote work breaks large companies</h2><p>Remote work supporters often return to the “interruption culture” at an IRL office as an argument for distributed work. First, clearly people that believe remote work creates an interruption-free zone have never used Slack or email. Second, those interruptions often exist for a reason: They often communicate information that ensures everyone is working on the right thing.</p><p>For companies that have strong product/market fit, have reached scale, and have a clear product roadmap, remote works swimmingly. A distraction-free environment means everyone can focus on “what matters” because “what matters” has been clear and consistent. &nbsp;</p><p>But what happens when “what matters” changes? </p><p>Because it will. Eventually, the market shifts. There’s a competitor or a Black Swan-style event in the industry (like, say, a global pandemic). Suddenly the well-oiled machine needs to adapt and change course. For companies larger than 100 people, this is tremendously difficult in an in-person environment. Working remote, it’s damn near impossible. Twice-a-year in-person meetups are not enough to disseminate brand new strategies. </p><p>And I'd bet that as formerly IRL companies go remote, it will have a negative effect on their ability to iterate and adjust to market conditions making them vulnerable for a smaller, co-located upstart.</p><h2 id="remote-work-can-stifle-your-career-growth">Remote work can stifle your career growth</h2><p>Think back to your first job in your current field. I’d bet there is a person or group of people who were tremendously important in shaping your career. They gave you candid advice and were able to passively observe and critique your behavior.</p><p>When you work remotely, mentorship is stifled because there is no learning via osmosis. You can’t model your behavior on your successful teammates because you only see them on Zoom and in Slack. Whatever process they are using to achieve their results is opaque to you. </p><p>Much of the language used around remote work (and remote events) assumes that one is in the mid-to-late stages of their career. When you’re young, you don’t need “focus” or to “get things done.” You need exposure to new ideas and people. You need the serendipitous fortune of sitting in on the right meeting, attending the right happy hour, or earning the respect of the right observer.</p><p>All of the above is more difficult in a remote environment. As a result, we are in danger of having a generation of new knowledge workers who are never properly onboarded and hastily told to work remotely with nothing but an OKR to chase. They have no context for how to do all of the messy office-ready skills like building consensus, having productive disagreements, and advocating for their ideas.</p><p>Additional…</p></div></section></article></div></main></div></div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594000429895_118575"><div><h2>The mystery of its location</h2><p>It’s often repeated how most of the cameras that landed on the moon stayed on the moon. Astronaut Gene Cernan had been telling the story of how<a href="https://petapixel.com/2012/12/06/the-last-man-to-walk-on-the-moon-left-his-camera-for-a-long-term-gear-test/" target="_blank"> he left his camera</a> on the lunar rover<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/space/9728289/Apollo-17-commander-left-camera-on-moon-40-years-ago.html" target="_blank"> for years</a>, recounting the tale in interviews:</p><blockquote><p>"I left my Hasselblad camera there with the lens pointing up at the zenith, the idea being someday someone would come back and find out how much deterioration solar cosmic radiation had on the glass. So, going up the ladder, I never took a photo of my last footstep. How dumb! Wouldn’t it have been better to take the camera with me, get the shot, take the film pack off and then (for weight restrictions) throw the camera away?"</p></blockquote><p>It’s easy to accept Cernan at his word - he’s an American hero who flew to space three times, twice to the moon - so as far as everyone was concerned, including the press, the camera was right where he said he left it. Plus, a quick scan of the Apollo 17 stowage list reveals no mention of a lunar surface camera splashing down with the command module. So why the mystery? </p><p>Looking closer, there’s a sprinkling of evidence in photos and transcripts that suggest his camera did in fact return to earth, contradicting both the 1972 NASA inventory and the astronaut. No, don’t cue the dramatic music… there’s no mischief or intentional deception here. I believe Gene Cernan did leave a camera on the lunar rover, just not “his.”&nbsp;Memory can be a fickle thing, even for heroes, and that rings especially true in this case&nbsp;when the story involves not one camera, but three.</p><h2>A tale of three cameras</h2><p>When you’re going to the moon, you’re assigned a camera with a 60mm lens that gets strapped to your chest to document samples, experiments, and the lunar terrain. Both astronauts get their own, clearly labeled with a sticker on the side: “CDR” for commander and “LMP” for lunar module pilot, but they weren’t mutually exclusive, often being swapped throughout the mission based on what film they were shooting with. On Apollo 17, Jack Schmitt - LMP and geologist extraordinaire - was set up with the black &amp; white film. When he needed color, he’d grab Cernan’s camera and vice versa. </p><p>A third Hasselblad camera was also to be used on the mission; it was a bit of a beast really, boasting a 500mm telephoto lens meant to capture distant lunar features for, you know… science. Of the two astronauts, Cernan got stuck looking down the barrel of the 500mm the most, so it’s entirely possible that <em>this</em> is the camera he remembers leaving on the rover. In fact, the post-flight analysis of the transcript pretty much confirms it. But what happened with the other two?</p><h2>The stowage list says they stayed </h2><p>A little background. As each Apollo mission launched, NASA prepared a final stowage list that documented all the equipment aboard, detailing what was to be transferred between each spacecraft before and after landing on the moon. This list was then revised in real time as plans changed due to time or weight restrictions. In the latest revision of the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17stowage.pdf" target="_blank">Apollo 17 LM Lunar Launch Stowage List</a>, dated December 12th, 1972, the three cameras that went down in the LM are all marked as “offloaded,” meaning they were left on the surface. The problem is, they launched from the moon on December 13th! So if extra items were brought onboard, it’s not recorded. At least not in what’s available online.</p></div></div><div><div><div data-aspect-ratio="55.70987654320988" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594649779919_85920"><div>

Presumably, the intent was to recover the camera at some future date to get information of long-term exposure to the lunar environment.]</em></p><p>[Cernan - "Parker said 'We'll bring them both (that is, both cameras) back,' but I know what I did with that camera. I left it on the Rover pointed straight up. <strong>That's what I planned to do and that's what I did. </strong>I can remember specifically wedging it - I don't remember exactly where - somewhere up between our seats."]</p></blockquote><p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Fast forward to where the astronauts are now back at the LM &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</em></p><blockquote><p>170:39:59&nbsp;<strong>Parker [Mission Control]: </strong>Okay, and we gather an ETB coming up with two cameras in it.</p><p>170:40:04&nbsp;<strong>Schmitt:</strong> ETB's next.

One update for the post-sleep procedure. I understand you brought in the LMP's camera, and we want to be sure you get that into the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-JettBag.html" target="new">jett bag</a>&nbsp;before the final jettison here. And, by the way, you're Stay for that final jettison.</p><p>183:40:39&nbsp;<strong>Schmitt: </strong>Okay, Gordy. It's already in the jett bag, thank you. (Pause)</p><p><em>[</em><strong><em>Cernan </em></strong><em>- "Obviously, I did not leave the LMP's camera on the Rover pointed at the zenith. But I swear I put something there. It's possible it could have been the 500 lens, because we didn't bring it back and I mentioned it was under the seat. I know that I did something with a camera. Now, it could have been a lens. And I stuck it between the seats, sort of wedged it in somewhere, and pointed the lens toward the zenith."]</em></p><p>[<strong>Schmitt </strong>- "Houston wanted us to jettison the camera because they didn't want us to take pictures of Ron Evans' EVA. They had decided it was too cumbersome and too risky. But, we were going to ignore them, and we figured out how we could do it. But we needed a camera. Ron had a camera, but it was not EVA-qualified."]</p><p>[<strong>Cernan</strong> - "We had made up our minds we were going to take pictures of Ron."]</p><p>[<strong>Schmitt </strong>- "And we needed a lunar-surface camera to do it."]</p><p><strong>[Cernan - "Now, we did put the LMP's camera in the jett bag, so we must have had mine."]</strong></p></blockquote><p>*Click*. Finally, we have some clarity. One 500mm camera stays behind, and of the two that go up into the LM, the LMP camera gets jettisoned back to the surface before launch. Cernan’s camera leaves with them as they blasted off live on TV and in color.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594997167739_70248"><div>

July 26, 2020 | https://mindfulnessquest.com/how-to-train-your-subconscious-mind-to-think-positive/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mindfulnessquest.com/how-to-train-your-subconscious-mind-to-think-positive/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Before we get into the details of how to train your subconscious mind, let’s understand the importance of positive thinking and how does the subconscious mind work.</p> <p>There was a time in my life when I was trying hard to improve my financial situation. Despite being a qualified IT professional with more than 12 years of work experience, I was unable to find work for myself. So I decided to make it on my own and started freelancing for clients.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-box-3"></span></p><p>But very soon, I found myself failing miserably to generate sustainable income, and as time progressed, I started becoming angry and frustrated. I started criticizing everything and everyone around me, my relationships suffered, and I started losing health.</p><p>Before I even realized I was grossly overweight, I was having lower back pains and bouts of migraine tension headaches (programmers know what I’m talking about).</p><p>Things were going from bad to worse for me. It took me some time to realize that I needed to clear this pool of negative energy, which I had built around me and be more accepting of what life has to offer me.</p><p>Most people tell themselves, “Oh, I’ll be happy once I achieve this or that,” and that’s the root cause of their misery in the first place.</p><p>You can manifest whatever you desire in life, and the universe will assist you, but you have to approach it with positivity. Positive thinking changes our outlook of life and fills us with compassion and love. Once I understood this, things started rolling for me.</p><h2>So what exactly is the subconscious mind?</h2><p>Most people believe that the human mind has dual nature, the conscious or the rational mind, and the subconscious mind. The conscious mind is aware and contains all thoughts, feelings, memories, desires, and is more logical.</p><p>A subconscious mind, on the other hand, is like a reservoir or a vast database that contains all types of thoughts, memories, feelings, and emotions.</p><p>Unlike the conscious mind, the subconscious mind lacks the discriminatory capability of what is good or bad. It believes whatever your conscious mind tells it. And that’s the reason why it is so powerful.</p><p>The only way to program the subconscious mind is through the conscious mind. So if you repeat positive affirmations such as, “I am a happy person, I will succeed in my endeavors, I will achieve financial freedom”, your subconscious mind will start believing it. Even in times of greatest adversities, you will stay strong and focused on your goals.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p><p>On the other hand, if you repeat negative affirmations such as, “I don’t deserve success, I can’t afford that car, I’m bad at managing relationships”, the mind will start believing that and may drive you into depression, anxiety, and fear.</p><p><em>The subconscious mind
can be our best friend or our worst enemy. It can be whatever we want it to be.</em></p><p>The subconscious mind is reactive, and it reacts to the nature of your thoughts. Did you know that the subconscious mind makes up more than 90% of your mind, as opposed to the conscious mind?</p><p>How many times have you tried quitting smoking and failed? How many times did you try losing weight but ended up gaining instead? How many times did you start a project just to leave it midway or when you were just about to finish? Why does this happen to us? This happens because we have not programmed your subconscious mind properly.</p><p>Now that we understand how the subconscious mind works, let’s explore the various ways in which we can harness its power to be more productive and successful in life.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-box-4"></span></p><h2>Mindfulness Meditation</h2><p>Meditation is one of the most powerful tools to train your subconscious mind. In meditation, we go deep inside ourselves and observer our thoughts and emotions. We simply become the witness without judging or being affected by the thoughts we generate.</p><p>If you want to get started with meditation, check out the free <a href="https://mindfulnessquest.com/meditation-guide/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ultimate Meditation Guide</a>.</p><p>Meditation helps you to advance spiritually by making you calm inside, and psychologically more stable. By practicing it every day, you slowly learn to confront your fears and negative emotions and are no more affected by them.</p><p>Start by sitting in a comfortable posture. You can be seated on the ground in a cross-legged position, or if that’s uncomfortable, just sit on a chair with your spine erect. One of the simple techniques involves watching the breath as if it moves in and out of your body.</p><p>Start by doing this every day for just 10 minutes and gradually increase the time as you become more proficient in it.</p><h2>Positive Affirmations</h2><p>Earlier, we touched upon this briefly and saw how the conscious mind could be used as a tool to train your subconscious mind. If there were no consciousness or awareness, it would be impossible to train the subconscious mind and avail the infinite potential it offers.</p><p>One way is to use Affirmations. The main process here is to keep repeating a particular behavior over and over again until the message is deeply ingrained in your subconscious mind. For example, if you want to lose weight, keep telling yourself, “I’m not going to stop my workouts until I shed 10 pounds”.</p><p>One thing to note here is that you should not take up a challenge that far exceeds your present capacity. Otherwise, this will not work, and this is the main reason why people fail in their resolutions.</p><p>For example, don’t try to lose 20 pounds in 1 month is you are overweight. Be practical while making your affirmations, and choose a small target initially. Once you achieve your goal, increase the challenge.</p><p>Here is a list of some of the most common affirmations
people use to train their mind:</p><ol><li>I will think positive.</li><li>I will not judge others and be critical of them.</li><li>I will spread love and joy to others because I’m happy inside.</li><li>I am a spiritual being with infinite potential to love.</li><li>Each day I will make an effort to learn something new.</li><li>I will keep a smile on my face throughout the day, even if no one talks to me.</li><li>I will not let negative though pull me down.</li></ol><p>By repeating such affirmations, you tremendously boost your self-esteem, develop empathy towards others, tone down your ego, and increase your confidence.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-large-leaderboard-2"></span></p><p>You must make an effort to believe in your affirmations (with emotions). If you don’t believe what you are saying, your subconscious mind will not get the message. Just like meditation, affirmations also require daily practice.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>There are many other techniques which I will be covering shortly in other articles.</p><p>One of the most important books that helped me to learn about the subconscious mind is “The Power of Subconscious mind”. If you’re interested, you can check out this <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/301V3wS">book here on amazon</a>.</p><p>You can significantly increase your productivity by tapping the hidden powers of your subconscious mind. It just takes 30 to 40 minutes of your time daily, and the benefits are tremendous. Don’t take my word for it; just try it yourself and see.</p><p>Present times offer us unlimited opportunities, but the reason why we fail in our objectives is that we get distracted. Distractions are all around us in various forms.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-leader-1"></span></p><p>Our conscious mind has to deal with a lot of information at the same time. Through meditation, we get clarity as to what is useful and what is not, and positive affirmations allow us to transfer positive messages to our subconscious. Through repeated practice, we form habits that stick for life.</p><p><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/" data-pin-do="buttonBookmark" data-pin-color="red" data-pin-height="128"><img src="https://mindfulnessquest.com/ezoimgfmt/assets.pinterest.com/images/pidgets/pinit_fg_en_rect_red_28.png" ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" data-ezsrc="//mindfulnessquest.com/ezoimgfmt/assets.pinterest.com/images/pidgets/pinit_fg_en_rect_red_28.png"></a></p></div></div>]]>

July 26, 2020 | https://chrisshort.net/the-aws-bill-heard-around-the-world/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://chrisshort.net/the-aws-bill-heard-around-the-world/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main"><div><div><article role="main"><h2 id="scene">Scene</h2><p>It was a bright, Saturday morning, July 4, 2020. I had just gotten Max all situated with breakfast and cartoons (Mighty Mike, if you’re curious). Julie was sleeping in like she usually does on every day I have off. I’m an early riser and this is a cherished part of our co-parenting. It gives Max and I time to bond (when he’s not stuffing his face and laughing at cartoons). I sat down with my laptop to plow through the week’s personal email.</p><h3 id="the-e-mail">The e-mail</h3><p>“Oh look, the AWS bill, I should have a laugh at that,” I thought to myself. Until recently, it had been pennies a month for some very light SES usage. In February, I moved off Google Cloud back to AWS. The primary motivation was that Google had so intertwined GSuite and GCP IAM that it became overly confusing.</p><p>Along with that migration came the CDN for this web site (cdn.chrisshort.net). I mean <a href="https://chrisshort.net/low-cost-content-delivery-network-cdn/">a Cloudflare fronted S3 bucket that holds assets deemed too big for git</a> when I say CDN. It’s not even <a href="https://chrisshort.net/">chrisshort.net</a> itself, as it is hosted on Netlify’s CDN and every other static site I own or manage. I’ve been a Cloudflare user for a long time. The CDN is less than 300 files and has existed for over five years on various clouds. Moving it back to AWS from GCP bumped the AWS bill to an average of $23/month. Not too bad given the <a href="https://app.usefathom.com/share/suwvjwwc/chrisshort.net">site’s traffic</a>.</p><h3 id="the-shock">The shock</h3><p>Not on this Saturday morning, nope. June 2020’s AWS bill was a heart palpitation causing <strong>$2,657.68</strong> (<a href="https://chrisshort.net/the-aws-bill-heard-around-the-world/invoice498711077_redacted.jpg">JPG</a>). I audibly gasped, “Keep your shit together.” I thought to myself. Max was leaned up against me drinking his milk. I know he could tell something was wrong because he looked at the laptop screen. I only assume when he saw letters and numbers, he thought, “Adult stuff… These cartoons and this Cinnamon Toast Crunch tho.” 2020 being the year that it is and my military history being what it is, I’ve been diagnosed with a panic disorder (on top of the PTSD and physical injuries).</p><h3 id="the-panic">The panic</h3><blockquote data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Good morning, $2700 AWS bill!</p><p>Holy shit...</p></div>— Chris Short (@ChrisShort) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisShort/status/1279406322837082114?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 4, 2020</a></blockquote><p>I immediately began having a panic attack. As I took the mental steps to mitigate the onset of the panic attack, I started forming a battle plan. Yes, I can switch back to emergency mode, like back in the old days, when something would go bang or boom, and I’d run towards it (it’s not helpful overall, trust me).</p><p>First, Max: Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs? Check.<br>Next, me: As if it was destined, my alert for morning medications went off.</p><p>“Daddy’s gotta grab his meds, bud.” Instinctively, Max leans off me (wow… okay… he’s used to hearing that reminder and statement shortly after that; my brain is now in overdrive). I take everything I need to conquer this while still being able to function cognitively. I refill my coffee and grab a laptop charger.</p><h2 id="incident-response">Incident response</h2><p>Check the source of truth.</p><p>What’s diverged?</p><p>How do we get things back to normal?</p><p>I login to the AWS console, hoping I got some output that was uniquely off this month. Weirder stuff has happened (like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/message/41926/">S3 going down</a>). This bill couldn’t be more out of the norm than ever. This AWS bill is several hundred dollars more than our mortgage! I hit the AWS Billing page and am deeply saddened by what I see:</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/1f2dd17bc5d8e1407c22b84f7f981a7ad9888eba/8e235/the-aws-bill-heard-around-the-world/aws-bill-landing-page.png" alt="AWS Billing landing page showing a $2,657.68 balance"></p><p>There it was. <strong>$2,657.68</strong>, staring at me. “This can’t be legit.” Drilling down even further, it looks like it is indeed legitimate traffic from the cdn.chrisshort.net S3 bucket in us-east-2. In total, <strong>more than 30.6 terabytes of traffic</strong> had moved out of that one S3 bucket. WHEN?!? Did this just happen? Nope.</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3373f05e910b0938aeed4a2975b4b4f48922fdc0/2e223/the-aws-bill-heard-around-the-world/aws-june-2020-data-transfer.png" alt="AWS data transfer billing break down"></p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/46294144a86a5d64df074d306386b3024b7d882a/af2d6/the-aws-bill-heard-around-the-world/june-23-24-2020-s3-breakdown.png" alt="S3 Activity"></p><p><strong>30.6 TB?!?!</strong> how is that even possible???<br>$1,011.59 on 23 June 2020.<br>$1,639.07 on 24 June 2020.</p><p>I immediately open a ticket with AWS Support frantically wondering what broke? How is this even possible? Did someone bypass Cloudflare? What the hell is Cloudflare saying?</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6cd3322753f262dc51bbca44a07fef6b19b381e9/52aec/the-aws-bill-heard-around-the-world/cloudflare_june_22_2020.png" alt="Cloudflare 22 June 2020"><br>Oh cool, Cloudflare let those 2,700 requests passthrough completely uncached? How is that not anomaly detected as a DDoS??? How is it that barely a fraction of the traffic is cached (more on that later)?</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/a0f7d1526c44cb74baba13f749f3d5a886bbdadb/6d2b1/the-aws-bill-heard-around-the-world/cloudflare_june_23_2020.png" alt="Cloudflare 23 June 2020"><br>Oh, another 4,400 requests the next day… Sweet, baby Jesus. Oh, but you served 9 GB from cache. Thanks, Cloudflare.</p><h2 id="help-arrives">Help Arrives</h2><p>Apparently, when you tweet something crazy af, like a $2700 AWS bill, it gets a lot of attention on a quiet holiday morning. A quarter-million people saw the tweet and a third of them interacted with it. It was enough attention that the AWS Support Twitter account was on it before, <a href="https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1186319925901586432">my friend</a> and <a href="https://www.duckbillgroup.com/">cloud economist</a>, Corey Quinn.</p><blockquote data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh no! 😰 Sorry to hear about this unpleasant Saturday morning surprise, Chris. Please create a support case so our agents can help get to the bottom of this: <a href="https://t.co/weTUnSYLRU">https://t.co/weTUnSYLRU</a>. 🕵️‍♀️ ^HG</p>— AWS Support (@AWSSupport) <a href="https://twitter.com/AWSSupport/status/1279424879566163970?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 4, 2020</a></blockquote><br>Praise Twitter for at least its ability to draw attention to things. I am not sure this would’ve ended up as well as it did without it.<blockquote data-dnt="true"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/tUrNnXqWMY">pic.twitter.com/tUrNnXqWMY</a></p>— HydroxyCoreyQuinn (@QuinnyPig) <a href="https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1279446759664611329?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 4, 2020</a></blockquote><br>I forwarded the bill to Corey almost immediately after seeing it at pre-dawn west coast time. I am forever thankful to Corey for his analysis. When he was ready, Corey sent me a list of things he needed to do an analysis (instead, I created him a regular IAM account with the proper perms 😉 and yes I cleaned up after).<p>Corey encouraged me to apply a bucket policy that would only allow Cloudflare IP addresses to access anything from the bucket. The theory here is that someone could have been bypassing Cloudflare somehow. But, thankfully, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/">Cloudflare publishes their IP blocks</a> and they don’t change all that often. The Cloudflare support article, <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037983412-Configuring-an-Amazon-Web-Services-static-site-to-use-Cloudflare#77nNxWyQf69T1a78gPlCi9">Configuring an Amazon Web Services static site to use Cloudflare</a> gives you an example bucket policy to do exactly that. This should become a standard practice for folks. However, it wouldn’t have mattered in this case; more on that later.</p><p>Corey Quinn’s thread on the topic covers what happened on the AWS side pretty well:</p><blockquote data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">That's right--it's threading time!<a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisShort?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@chrisshort</a>'s surprise <a href="https://twitter.com/awscloud?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@awscloud</a> bill of $2700 looks S3 driven... <a href="https://t.co/VnXufn24iA">https://t.co/VnXufn24iA</a> <a href="https://t.co/tKLWv5rHtW">pic.twitter.com/tKLWv5rHtW</a></p>— HydroxyCoreyQuinn (@QuinnyPig) <a href="https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1280280727133642753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 6, 2020</a></blockquote><ul><li>”…it’s almost entirely due to us-east-2 data transfer out…”</li><li>“Now, what caused this? Nobody knows!”</li><li>“Chris Short isn’t some random fool…” (Might be the nicest thing Corey’s every said about anyone he’s not related to)</li><li>”‘Surprise jackhole, your mortgage isn’t your most expensive bill this month, guess you shoulda enabled billing alarms!’ is crappy, broken, and WOULD NOT HAVE SOLVED THE PROBLEM!”</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1280289410844471296?s=20">“I want to be explicitly clear here: Chris Short didn’t do anything wrong!”</a></li></ul><h2 id="but-wait-there-s-more">But wait! There’s more!</h2><p>I had tickets in with Cloudflare (1918916) and AWS (7153956931). Cloudflare was the least helpful service I could have imagined given the circumstances. A long term user and on and off customer thinks they were attacked for two days and you don’t lift a finger? If I didn’t have reason enough to move off of Cloudflare, I do now. That’ll be an update for a later blog post. But, if you work for a CDN company and you’re relatively painless to get up and running, I’m interested in hearing from you.</p><p>After a very chaotic morning, I take Corey’s advice, disconnect, and enjoy the holiday weekend.</p><h2 id="more-help-arrives">More Help Arrives</h2><p>On July 8th, an astute AWS employee starts doing some digging around and reaches out to me. Because they see this as bafflingly as Corey and I do. How did so few requests generate so much traffic so quickly and then as soon as it appears, it’s gone again? It doesn’t seem like something intentionally malicious either because Cloudflare and AWS let it right on through.</p><h3 id="here-s-the-theory">Here’s the theory</h3><p>In hindsight, I made a poor decision to distribute a trial Windows 2019 SQL Server virtual machine images (fully patched with all necessary drivers and VM extensions) in the form of a qcow2 file. Someone became aware of the existence of this VM image. They then stood up hundreds, potentially thousands, of copies this VM using the internet accessible URL. This is, in theory, possible, with something like <a href="https://chrisshort.net/tags/kubernetes/">Kubernetes</a> and <a href="https://kubevirt.io/">Kubevirt</a>. Given that the disk image becomes a volume mount in the corresponding VMs pod. Spin up enough copies of the VM, a single YAML file can create infinite copies of a VM. If the YAML definition directly referenced the Cloudflare or S3 URL and not a locally cached copy, you can rack up the number of times you pull down an image real quick. The qcow2 image, in this case, was 13.7 GB. But it’s trickier than that.</p><h3 id="the-sharp-edge-of-the-cloud">The sharp edge of the cloud</h3><p>File this under, “Things I should’ve known but didn’t.” Did you know that “The maximum file size Cloudflare’s CDN caches <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200172516-Understanding-Cloudflare-s-CDN#:~:text=The%20maximum%20file%20size%20Cloudflare's,request%20caching%20of%20larger%20files."><strong>is 512MB</strong></a> for Free, Pro, and Business customers and 5GB for Enterprise customers.” That’s right, Cloudflare saw requests for a 13.7 GB file and sent them straight to origin every time <em>BY DESIGN</em>. <strong>Ouch!</strong></p><p>I suspected these files immediately on July 4 and moved them to an internal work GDrive for the time being. If you need the images, let me know, you’re also a suspect if you ask for them, be warned.</p><p>If you’re sitting at home doing the math, something might not be adding up. The bandwidth cost is off, there was indeed some legitimate traffic to the bucket in June, of course, But, as it turns out the intrepid AWS employee discovered that 3655 partial GETs to the object might have actually been delivered as full file requests and Cloudflare might have ever done anything with them. Yes, this is a bug somewhere and folks are looking into it. I also suggested that object size limits be a tunable S3 bucket policy. This way, I wouldn’t have even been able to upload the files to the bucket, to begin with.</p><h2 id="the-resolution">The Resolution</h2><p>As I mentioned, I’ve removed the multiple gigabyte files from the bucket the day I got the bill (July 4). <a href="https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1280282363461726208">Corey pointed that out here</a>. That might have hindered the investigation from the AWS side. I won’t be so quick to delete in the future. I will lock files down though. But, let’s face it. Now that I’m aware of the <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200172516-Understanding-Cloudflare-s-CDN#:~:text=The%20maximum%20file%20size%20Cloudflare's,request%20caching%20of%20larger%20files.">512 MB file limit at Cloudflare</a>, I am moving other larger files in that bucket to <a href="https://archive.org/">archive.org</a> for now (and will add them to my supported <a href="https://chrisshort.net/causes/">Causes</a>).</p><p>Long term, I won’t want to store files in …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

  <p>For HA and easier management of our containers we can create swarm cluster.<br>
It is composed of couple nodes with docker engine installed.</p>
<p>How to setup swarm and use it?</p>
<h3 id="example-configuration-and-prerequisites">Example configuration and prerequisites</h3>
<p>In my lab environment I used three nodes:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Role in Swarm</th>
<th>Server</th>
<th>IP</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Manager</td>
<td>docker-host1.lukas.int</td>
<td>10.10.10.20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Worker1</td>
<td>docker-host2.lukas.int</td>
<td>10.10.10.21</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Worker2</td>
<td>docker-host3.lukas.int</td>
<td>10.10.10.22</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Each node has got docker engine installed with standard procedure as for single node docker.</p>
<p>Ports that are need to be open on each node:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>TCP/UDP</th>
<th>Port</th>
<th>What is for?</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>TCP</td>
<td>2377</td>
<td>cluster management</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>TCP and UDP</td>
<td>7946</td>
<td>node communication</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>UDP</td>
<td>4789</td>
<td>overlay network</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Log in to manager node.</p>
<p>Most importatnt parameters for <code>docker swarm init</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--autolock</code> - <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> - enable autolock for manager node - more later in this post</li>
<li><code>--advertise-addr</code> - address for API and overlay networks for other cluster members</li>
<li><code>--listen-addr</code> - address for cluster management</li>
<li><code>--availability</code> - cloud be <code>active</code>(new tasks allowed), <code>pause</code>(new tasks not allowed, but old keeps going) or <code>drain</code>(new tasks not allowed, finish immediately old ones if they exists) - set drain for manager node to create manager without containers on it</li>
<li><code>--default-addr-pool</code> - by default <code>10.10.10.0/8</code> - we can set another address pool for overlay network created with cluster</li>
<li><code>--default-addr-pool-mask-len</code> - number on subnets that are allow to be created in <code>--default-addr-pool</code></li>
</ul>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>[</span>lukas@docker-host1 ~<span>]</span>$ docker swarm init --advertise-addr 10.10.10.20 --listen-addr 10.10.10.20
Swarm initialized: current node <span>(</span>x7mdjbmfz3ttkxbvelriix4yz<span>)</span> is now a manager.

To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-0zwqchv43d2alvl99fgw2mh6cnv7xc8vakspd90yjh4i7eiwwx-cn32plktlwjf8q25azk37ij5v 10.10.10.20:2377

To add a manager to this swarm, run <span>'docker swarm join-token manager'</span> and follow the instructions.

<ul>
<li>sends tasks to worker nodes(or manager nodes also if we allow container there)</li>

</ul>
<p>It is strongly recommended to have at least three manager nodes in production cluster for HA. This configuration will survive lost of one manager node.<br>
In such configuration still only one of managers will be leader, rest will replicates data from him and waits for his breakdown.</p>

      </div>
      
      
      
      
      

      
      
      
      <p>
        <span>Emergency Remote is a book of opportunity. It lights the way to turn a forced
          remote work situation into a great management success. It contains simple steps
          that will help you not only keep operating, but blow away the competition.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Some believe they can work from home as if they are in the office. "Just add
          some tools for video calls and everything will work just fine", they say.
          This cannot be further from the truth. Setting up video is to successful remote
          work as setting up tables is to successful onsite work. You'll probably use
          it, but it's not nearly enough.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Emergency Remote is divided into three succinct sections. The first discusses the
          underlying values required for remote work to function, the second ensures the
          right tools are set up, and the third describes the five immediate actions to
          perform for better remote work.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>It is an easy, quick read. In fact, the average reader will finish the book in
          less than 15 minutes. After following it you'll have enough space to learn
          from the vast resources on remote work </span><span>available </span><span>online and adjust them to fit your company.</span>
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
        <span>Remote work is composed of three pillars that are crucial to the success of the
          method. They are important to understand before going forward with
          implementation.</span>
      </p>
      
      <h2 id="h.rrpubh4i8p5v"><span></span></h2>
      
      <h2 id="h.1fqjja11bgze"><span>Trust</span></h2>
      
      <p>
        <span>Trust is your belief in a colleague's ability to deliver work in the best
          possible way. Note, this does not mean a guaranteed delivery every time, but the
          ability to deliver. It includes asking for help if needed, recovering from
          mistakes and improving for next time.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Trust is essential because trusting others allows you to focus on your actual
          work, knowing they'll deliver. When others trust you, you get that unique
          peace of mind, the freedom to do your work.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Without trust, employees will be agitated. Worried that their own work will be
          wronged by employees they rely on, either directly or indirectly. That is an
          impossible way to work, especially remotely.</span>
      </p>
      <h2 id="h.1cdix8fys4aq"><span> </span></h2>
      <h2 id="h.vvx9who9kf19"><span>Evergreen Communication</span></h2>
      
      <p>
        <span>Evergreen </span><span>C</span><span>ommunication achieves productive work and </span><span>always-available </span><span>conversations. Both are "evergreen"</span><span>,</span><span> meaning preserved. To accomplish </span><span>that</span><span>, </span><span>two things are needed.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>First</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>asynchronous (async) communication</span><span> —</span><span> communicati</span><span>on</span><span> without the expectation of immediate response.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Second</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>history preservation</span><span>. </span><span>C</span><span>onversation</span><span>s</span><span> should be kept whole and in orde</span><span>r</span><span>, forever.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Evergreen </span><span>C</span><span>ommunication is essential because it allows employees to always work on
          what's most important, always be up to date, and have the reasoning behind
          every decision at their fingertips. They can jump into any conversation that needs
          them, and answer without sacrificing productive work. New employees could even
          onboard themselves.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Without </span><span>Evergreen</span><span> </span><span>Communication</span><span>, we're back to square one. Having everyone present, either in a chat, call
          or physical room forces participants to stop ongoing productive flow. Incomplete
          summaries, as they always are, </span><span>c</span><span>ause information loss and make the reasoning behind decisions </span><span>v</span><span>ague at best.</span>

        <span>Independence is the state where the employee(s) working on a task needs little to
          no outside involvement. This does not mean that employees will work in silos. Some
          tasks require more than one person to perform. If most tasks require one person,
          it means they are small (as they should) and that team cooperation will take place
          when joining the individual tasks to form a whole.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>It is essential because it makes sure each and every task is self-contained. That
          is, the employees responsible for it have all they need in order to deliver, and
          the risk of them being blocked is reduced. Further, increasing employees'
          resources in this way increases innovation, which again contributes to
          production.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Without independence, productive work is undermined. The business will be tangled
          with permissions requests, employees will be blocked by their privileged
          counterparts, and innovation will halt at the face of bureaucracy. All of these
          are detrimental, more so in a remote environment, where bureaucracy is harder to
          deal with, and therefore should be prevented.</span>
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
        <span>You will only need four tools to be productive remotely. A tool used as a single
          source of truth and three tools used for the three forms of communication: async,
          hybrid and sync. That's it.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>All employees should have access to as much material as your company's level
          of transparency allows, without complex permissions or process.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Each tool will have an example using a specific brand. While many brands supply
          these tools, make sure to only use one for each categor</span><span>y</span><span>. Different teams prefer different tools, but they cause duplication and
          fragmentation, which harms productivity.</span>

        <span>Single Source of Truth</span>
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        <span>The Single Source of Truth is a website or collection of files that always
          represent the up-to-date and true state of work. It must adhere to Evergreen
          Communication and track changes and their reasoning, allow rollbacks to previous
          versions and keep communications async.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Once this is set up, everyone should always update the work and communicate in
          regards to the single source of truth. Gone are the days of files scattered across
          various emails.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Example:</span><span>
          Google Docs for a law company will hold all strategies, contracts, company
          policies, and so on. Every change done for the client or </span><span>to</span><span>
          company policy will be reflected immediately to all involved. Changes are always
          tracked, previous versions preserved, and </span><span>d</span><span>iscuss</span><span>ions are evergreen</span><span>.</span>

        <span>Async Communication: Task Manager</span>
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        <span>Tasks should be managed using a task manager, a type of software. </span><span>They</span><span>
          should be discussed and when done, changes should be made to the source of truth.
          Task managers are completely async, have reproducible history to understand </span><span>past</span><span>
          decisions, and always show the state of work, making status meetings
          redundant.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>This is the hardest tool to choose, as it is company specific. Take </span><span>time</span><span>
          to test different options. If the one you have doesn't work for you, change
          it. Communicate this to your employees</span><span>. P</span><span>revent disruption </span><span>with gradual adoption</span><span>. </span><span>You will find one that works.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Example #1:</span><span> Trello or Asana for a law firm. </span><span>E</span><span>mployees could open tasks, involve others and</span><span> jump i</span><span>n to help. A paralegal may open a task "Fix typo in website", the IT
          person may reply "Currently overwhelmed", then a secretary may jump in
          "I've built website</span><span>s </span><span>before, can I help?". This kind of </span><span>exchange is impossible</span><span> to achieve without the three pillars</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>It</span><span>
          happens in remote companies every day, boosting the heart of the</span><span>ir</span><span> production.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Example #2:</span><span> GitLab for software companies. </span><span>These apps</span><span> often double as a source of truth </span><span>with</span><span> their code hosting function and as task managers </span><span>with</span><span> their ticketing (issues, pull requests) system.</span>

        <span>Hybrid Communication: Chat App</span>
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        <span>While the bulk of communication should be done using the task manager, sometimes
          we need to quickly hash things out. This is where chat apps come into play. They
          are hybrid, neither async n</span><span>or</span><span>
          sync. While it's possible to reply later, it's not easy. </span><span>M</span><span>essages come and go</span><span>,</span><span> pushing people to </span><span>respond immediately</span><span>.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Therefore, for work talk, use these only for quick, ephemeral conversations. Any
          long lasting or high impact communications should use the task manager. Outside of
          work talk, chat plays a big role in socializing and enjoying each other's
          company, an important aspect to preserve when working </span><span>remotely</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>Avoid email or WhatsApp as much as you can. They are private by nature and make
          it harder for people to jump in if needed.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Example:</span><span> Slack</span><span> or any </span><span>app </span><span>with</span><span> private messages</span><span> and </span><span>public channels will do. Employees could publicly commend a team member for good
          work in the general channel, or offer feedback privately. They could hop into the
          memes and music channels for fun, ask in the IT channel if anyone noticed a system
          slowdown, or share research about </span><span>new</span><span> strategies in the marketing channel.</span>

Haskell provides lightweight user space threads that get scheduled by the Run Time System (RTS) onto a limited number of operating threads in a so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)#M:N_(hybrid_threading)">M:N threading model</a>. To handle blocking there are a few options, <a href="http://www.wjwh.eu/posts/2020-07-10-haskell-thread-blocked.html">about which I have written before</a>. For system calls on file descriptors that can return <code>EAGAIN</code> or <code>EWOULDBLOCK</code>, the RTS provides an I/O (not to be confused with <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Introduction_to_IO"><code>IO</code></a>) event manager where threads can register interest in a file descriptor before putting themselves into a sleeping state. If and when the file descriptor becomes available for reading or writing, the event manager will <a href="http://www.wjwh.eu/posts/2020-07-10-haskell-thread-blocked.html">wake up</a> any threads that have registered interest in it. The event manager system contains a <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/blob/master/libraries/base/GHC/Event/Manager.hs">manager module</a>, which provides the interface for the rest of the Haskell code. This module will choose the most performant option from <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/blob/master/libraries/base/GHC/Event/Manager.hs#L169-178">a number of backends</a> available on the current system. So, it will choose the <code>epoll</code> backend on most Linux systems, the <code>kqueue</code> backend on BSD systems, etc. This article is about the design and first results of a new event manager backend based on the <code>io_uring</code> interface.</p>
<p><em>Side note: quite recently a native I/O manager for Windows systems was merged into GHC. Sadly, I don’t know enough about it yet to meaningfully include it into this article. As such, the information provided is only valid for POSIX-like systems.</em></p>
<p>The <code>io_uring</code> interface was added in the <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Linux-5.6-IO-uring-Tests">Linux kernel version 5.1</a> as an improvement to the earlier <code>aio</code> interface for asynchronous system calls. It operates by allocating two ring buffers that are shared between the kernel and the userspace program, known as the Submission Queue (SQ) and the Completion Queue (CQ). The program puts any number of system call requests (known as Submission Queue Entries (SQEs)) into the SQ and can submit any number of them to the kernel with a single system call. The kernel then goes off to do the things requested and when (or if) the request is complete the result will be put into the CQ as a Completion Queue Entry (CQE). This means that the userspace program can check if any CQEs are available merely by checking the CQ, without having to do any system calls. This potentially saves a lot of work on context switches between the kernel and userspace for I/O heavy programs like web servers. As of the time of writing, there are SQEs available for file reading/writing, accepting network connections, polling file descriptors and several more. The author of the <code>io_uring</code> interface has stated that he intends to eventually provide asynchronous versions of all system calls where it makes sense. To implement an I/O event manager backend with <code>io_uring</code>, we only need the SQEs for polling and cancelling previous poll requests, but it would be interesting to see how much of <code>io_uring</code> could be leveraged to provide “true” asynchronous system calls in the future.</p>
<h2 id="iouring-backend-design">IoUring backend design</h2>
<p>Any I/O event manager backend must conform to <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/blob/master/libraries/base/GHC/Event/Internal.hs#L25-51">the interface defined for it</a>, which looks like this:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a><span>data</span> <span>Backend</span> <span>=</span> <span>forall</span> a<span>.</span> <span>Backend</span> {</span>

<span id="cb1-11"><a href="#cb1-11"></a>    <span>-- | Register, modify, or unregister interest in the given events</span></span>
<span id="cb1-12"><a href="#cb1-12"></a>    <span>-- on the given file descriptor.</span></span>

<span id="cb1-17"><a href="#cb1-17"></a>                  <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>Bool</span></span>
<span id="cb1-18"><a href="#cb1-18"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-19"><a href="#cb1-19"></a>    <span>-- | Register interest in new events on a given file descriptor, set</span></span>
<span id="cb1-20"><a href="#cb1-20"></a>    <span>-- to be deactivated after the first event.</span></span>
<span id="cb1-21"><a href="#cb1-21"></a>    ,<span> _beModifyFdOnce ::</span> a</span>
<span id="cb1-22"><a href="#cb1-22"></a>                         <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Fd</span>    <span>-- file descriptor</span></span>
<span id="cb1-23"><a href="#cb1-23"></a>                         <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Event</span> <span>-- new events to watch</span></span>
<span id="cb1-24"><a href="#cb1-24"></a>                         <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>Bool</span></span>
<span id="cb1-25"><a href="#cb1-25"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-26"><a href="#cb1-26"></a>    ,<span> _beDelete ::</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> ()</span>
<span id="cb1-27"><a href="#cb1-27"></a>    }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>That seems pretty reasonable, only four functions! Actually, there is also a <code>new</code> function to set up the backend so it’s more like five functions. ACTUALLY actually, the <code>_beModifyFd</code> function has three different modes of operation depending on which of its arguments are <code>mempty</code>. It can be either “add a polling request”, “modify a polling request” or “delete a polling request” so it is more like seven functions. Still, that is quite manageable. The interface description even describes what each function should do and which arguments it takes, which is more than I usually got in my previous day job.</p>
<p>Luckily, <a href="https://github.com/bgamari">Ben Gamari</a> had already written Haskell <a href="https://github.com/bgamari/io-uring">bindings</a> for using <code>io_uring</code> that could be adapted for an I/O manager backend. He was also a huge help in finding a segfault-causing bug that I would never have caught myself. Many thanks!</p>
<p>An interesting implementation detail of <code>io_uring</code> is that every SQE has a <code>userdata</code> field that gets copied over verbatim into the CQE for its completion. As we can see in the type signature for <code>_bePoll</code> we need both the original file descriptor and the events to issue the callback. In the earliest version, the new backend generated a unique <code>Int</code> for each request and stored this information (along with a Bool indicating whether the poll request was a “multishot” or not) in a hashtable. This worked, but testing showed that throughput was only about half of what the <code>epoll</code> backend could provide. After some discussion on the <code>#ghc</code> IRC channel, we realized that it was possible to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_field">bitpack</a> all the required data into the 64-bit <code>userdata</code> field. This cleared up the code significantly and provided a nice speed boost as well.</p>
<p>The code of the new backend can be found <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/WJWH/ghc/-/tree/io_uring_manager">over here</a>. At its heart, it is a <code>popAndCallbackAllCQEs</code> function. It is implemented as follows:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>-- The workhorse of this backend. Pops CQEs off the ringbuffer</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a><span>-- and issues callbacks to waiting threads</span></span>

<span id="cb2-11"><a href="#cb2-11"></a>      when (hasCallback) <span>$</span> callback fd (convertEventBack <span>$</span> cqeRes cqe)</span>
<span id="cb2-12"><a href="#cb2-12"></a>      <span>-- if it was a multishot poll, resubmit. If it was an error,</span></span>
<span id="cb2-13"><a href="#cb2-13"></a>      <span>-- don't resubmit to prevent getting into an infinite loop of errors</span></span>
<span id="cb2-14"><a href="#cb2-14"></a>      when (isMultishot <span>&amp;&amp;</span> cqeRes cqe <span>&gt;=</span> <span>0</span>) <span>$</span> <span>do</span></span>

<p>This function pops CQEs off the CQ and after un-bitpacking the <code>userdata</code> field of the CQE, performs the callback. It then recurses until <code>popCq</code> returns <code>Nothing</code>, indicating that there are no more unread CQEs to be consumed. Even in this small bit of code it’s already clear how many edge cases can occur. Some backend-internal CQEs don’t have an associated callback, so for this case we should skip that. If a multishot poll request fails, blindly resubmitting might result in an infinite loop of erroring poll requests.</p>
<h2 id="test-results">Test results</h2>
<p>To test the relative performance of the <code>io_uring</code> backend compared to the <code>epoll</code> backend, I needed an application that spends as much of its time as possible on pollable I/O. The <code>network</code> package provides sample code for a simple echo server which I adapted into <a href="https://gist.github.com/WJWH/97a102791e6ee08d98cc20145d9ba29a">an extremely basic HTTP server</a>. This program was compiled twice: once with the <code>epoll</code> backend and once with the <code>io_uring</code> backend. Then two <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/"><code>t3.xlarge</code></a> VMs with 4 CPU cores and 16 GB of RAM were acquired from AWS, one to host the test programs and one from which to run the <a href="https://www.petefreitag.com/item/689.cfm"><code>ab</code></a> HTTP load generator. I ran <code>ab</code> against each program in batches of 10.000 requests at concurrency levels of 5, 50 and 500 concurrent requests. To average out any jitter, each test run was performed three times and the results averaged.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.wjwh.eu/images/uring_graph_white.png" title="Haskell logo"><br>
</p>
<p>As you can see, the <code>io_uring</code> backend provides about 7% more requests per second (in this toy benchmark) at 5 concurrent requests, about 9% more requests per second at 50 concurrent requests and about 1.8% more at 500 concurrent requests. Presumably, at very high levels of concurrent requests other bottlenecks start to dominate performance. After sharing these findings in the <code>#ghc</code> IRC channel, I was advised to increase the size of the GC nursery to 16 MB (up from the default of 1 MB) and track the RTS performance statistics with the <code>-s</code> RTS option.</p>
<p>It turned out that at low concurrency the backends performed much the same, but at higher concurrency levels the <code>epoll</code> backend started spending much more time in garbage collection than the <code>io_uring</code> backend. This was mostly caused by the amount of retained objects being much larger for <code>epoll</code>, and as we all know <a href="https://tech.channable.com/posts/2020-04-07-lessons-in-managing-haskell-memory.html">GC time is related to heap size in Haskell</a>. In one particular case, <code>epoll</code> had a maximum residency of no less than 1,021,622,432 bytes (almost a full gigabyte) while <code>io_uring</code> reported a maximum residency of only 1,553,680 bytes, a reduction in memory use of almost 98.5%! This also resulted in GC pauses of almost 200 ms for the <code>epoll</code> backend to traverse all that memory, while the <code>io_uring</code> backend reported a maximum GC pause time of only 12 ms. Since most programs will also do other things than just report a single in-memory string back to callers this result is unlikely in “the real world”, but it is still remarkable. I suspect that the difference is caused by the <code>epoll()</code> syscall returning all the available file descriptors in a big array that the backend then <code>forM_</code>s over to perform the callbacks. The <code>io_uring</code> backend on the other hand can pop CQEs off the CQ one at a time and reclaim the memory for that CQE almost …</p></div></div>

<p>I’m no longer active on Facebook, but at the moment, oddly, it’s my main goto option to find out at least some of the companies that share my data.</p>



<p>Facebook lets you see who shared your data with them. There are two interesting pages, buried and well-hidden, worth checking: <strong>Off Facebook activity</strong> and <strong>Businesses who uploaded and used a list</strong>.</p>



<p>Want to see which companies are sharing your data? continue reading.</p>



<h2><a href="https://www.facebook.com/off_facebook_activity/activity_list" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Off Facebook activity</a></h2>



<p>This one is very interesting and I recommend visiting the link to check our your own list. I won’t share the screenshot, but from what I gathered, all this information was leaked via apps on my iPhone, before I’ve disabled ad tracking. I’ve written about it before: <a href="https://blog.gingerlime.com/2020/does-apple-care-about-your-privacy/">Does Apple care about your privacy?</a> and I recommend reading it, if only to know how to disable ad tracking on your Apple devices.</p>



<h2><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=information_about_you&amp;section_id=interacted#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Businesses who uploaded and used a list</a> </h2>



<div><figure><img src="https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/dave_who-892x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/dave_who-892x1024.png 892w, https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/dave_who-261x300.png 261w, https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/dave_who-768x882.png 768w, https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/dave_who.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px"></figure></div>



<p>My list can be divided to roughly 3 categories:</p>



<ol><li>Companies I know and use. Amazon, Uber, etc. So whilst they know me and I did give them my details, I <strong>never explicitly gave them consent to share my details</strong>. With Facebook or with anyone… </li><li>Companies I’ve heard of, but never signed-up for, used nor shared any details with. <strong>How the f*** do they even have my details?</strong> not to mention share them with Facebook (or who knows what other companies)</li><li>Companies I’ve never heard of, but <strong>the name alone looks really dodgy</strong>. “Mindshare Biddable Digital” … you can imagine what a company with this name is doing. </li><li>Dave M. Rogenmoser. He probably deserves his own category. I don’t know him, never heard about him, and frankly now want nothing whatsoever to do with him. Dave, if you’re reading this, WTF are you doing sharing people’s personal details with Facebook? especially people who you don’t know and definitely didn’t give you consent to share details of.</li></ol>



<p>Ok, so this was 4 categories I guess… Although Dave might more realistically fall into the 3rd one.</p>



<h2>What does it mean?</h2>



<p>In case you can’t read the text on the image, this is what Facebook tells us about it</p>



<blockquote><p>These businesses uploaded a list to Facebook. Lists can contain contact information, for example an email address or phone number that is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=information_about_you&amp;section_id=interacted#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">hashed</a> so that Facebook does not learn any new identifying information about you. Lists can also contain advertising identifiers instead of contact information. Information from lists is matched against our existing list of users. The identity of users is not revealed to the business during the matching process.</p><p>Facebook uses these lists only to match the information to your profile and to deliver the ads chosen by the advertiser. Facebook does not keep the information shared in these lists. Advertisers can use lists to show you more relevant ads or to exclude you from ads that may be less relevant to you. For example, if you’re already a member of a gym then the gym could choose to exclude you from ads about becoming a member.</p><p>Facebook doesn’t learn any new identifying information about users when lists are uploaded. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=information_about_you&amp;section_id=interacted#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Learn More</a></p></blockquote>



<p>So, let’s decipher things a bit here, shall we?</p>



<h2>Hash data</h2>



<p>Technically, it’s true that Dave and his friends don’t share my personal details directly. i.e. they won’t upload my actual email address to Facebook. They will upload a <em>hash</em> of my email. But then, Facebook obviously holds its own giant list of hashed emails and other personal details, so then when two hashes match, Facebook knows that it’s me. That’s the way they can show me this list of companies.</p>



<p>So is this data sharing? I think every reasonable person would think so. Obviously now Facebook knows more about me. At the very least my (forced) association with those companies. Their claim that “Facebook doesn’t learn <em>any new identifying information</em>…” is technically true, but practically false, because this association is super valuable. Not only for allowing advertising to place ads, but I imagine to increase the richness of the user profile and what Facebook knows about you.</p>



<h2>Lookalike audiences</h2>



<p>I’m not 100% sure about this, but I think that’s another thing to worry about: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/164749007013531?id=401668390442328" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Lookalike audiences</a>. When companies upload lists of emails to Facebook, they not only do it in order to target those users directly, but rather to also discover <em>similar</em> people. People who are likely to be interested in their ads.</p>



<p>So whilst Facebook doesn’t reveal any extra information about me directly with advertisers who upload my details, these companies get a huge “prize” for sharing my data with them: These companies are then able to <strong>target ads to people with similar interests to mine</strong>.</p>



<p>Add the fact that now Facebook knows more about us, because they not only see how we interact on Facebook or sites that use the Facebook like buttons etc, this practice feeds even more knowledge (and golden opportunity) to Facebook. So if they know X people who (like me) use Amazon, Uber, and Share Now, perhaps they are also likely to be interested in using Grab? So both Facebook and those companies have a <strong>clear interest sharing my data. But are they allowed to?</strong></p>



<h2>Legitimate business and consent</h2>



<p>Let’s leave Facebook out of it for a moment… Are these companies allowed to share information about me with <em>any other company</em> (Facebook or otherwise), without my explicit and informed consent?</p>



<p>I’m not a lawyer, but here’s <a href="https://gdpr.eu/recital-40-lawfulness-of-data-processing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recital 40 of the GPDR</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>In order for processing to be lawful, personal data should be processed on the basis of the consent of the data subject concerned or some other legitimate basis, laid down by law, either in this Regulation or in other Union or Member State law as referred to in this Regulation, including the necessity for compliance with the legal obligation to which the controller is subject or the necessity for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.</p></blockquote>



<p>The way I understand it, personal data should be processed either based on “some other legitimate basis”, or on the basis consent.</p>



<p><strong>Legitimate basis</strong>, in very simple terms, is when the data is necessary to provide the service. For example, if I sign up to Amazon, they need my email to send me order confirmations. That’s a legitimate basis. But using my email for marketing or advertising stops becoming a legitimate basis. Why? because it is not <em>required</em> to provide the service that Amazon provides me.</p>



<p>So if Amazon wants to send me ads, or share my email for other purposes that aren’t realistically legitimate, they are <strong>required to ask for my informed and explicit consent</strong>.</p>



<h2>“But hey! They didn’t share your personal data! They only shared a hash…”</h2>



<p>Technically they “only shared a hash”, but this hash identifies me clearly. I believe it falls under personal data under the GDPR as well.</p>



<p><a href="https://gdpr.eu/eu-gdpr-personal-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to the GDPR, Personal information</a> is (emphasis mine):</p>



<blockquote><p>… any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who <strong>can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as</strong> a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</p></blockquote>



<h2>It gets even stranger</h2>



<p>If I dig a bit deeper into my list of companies, I saw that one of them actually shared my details with Facebook in order <em>not</em> to show me ads. This is actually one of the examples that Facebook gives when they explained about the Gym.</p>



<p>It’s definitely good for the Gym (they will not waste money on advertising someone who is already their member)</p>



<p>It’s definitely good for Facebook (they will sell more targeted ads, increasing the value of their platform to advertisers)</p>



<p>Is it good for me? some might say yes, because I won’t see the Gym ads any more. But at what price? I will still see other ads. And now Facebook knows that I’m a Gym member. I’m sure lots of advertisers would jump on the opportunity to sell me some Gym gear. I think I’m much worse-off here.</p>



<h2>What can we do about it?</h2>



<p>If you have a Facebook account, I highly recommend checking those two pages I linked to and seeing which companies are sharing your data.</p>



<p>The thing I wonder about most though, is what <em>other</em> companies my data is being shared with. Companies I have no way whatsoever to see such a list…</p>



<p>I guess the best thing to do is to contact these companies and ask them to stop it. Or to file a GDPR complaint. I would also recommend checking out <a href="https://noyb.eu/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NOYB</a> (None Of Your Business). It’s a privacy non-profit organization that does some great work in this area. Sign up and become a member if you want to support their work further.</p>

<blockquote><p>How can I ensure my customer won’t share the video they purchased? Can I protect the PDF I sell to be shared only once? How can I lock my daughter in a high tower, so that no worldly harm befalls her?</p></blockquote>



<p>The tension between sharing our creations and being paid was always tricky. But the digital world adds another layer of complexity – your creations can be copied and distributed also <b>after the purchase</b>, keeping you out of the loop of future profits.</p>



<p>A natural instinct is to seek the answer in the technology that permitted sharing in the first place – can I protect the content I sold, so that only the customer has access to it?</p>



<p>Yes, but you shouldn’t. Over-protecting your content focuses on extraction over providing value. Here are 10 reasons why (Digital Rights Management)[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management">1</a>] DRMs are a bad idea:</p>



<h3>1 – It is just impossible to prevent sharing</h3>



<p>Trying to effectively protect content against sharing is like fighting against skilled guerilla units in the digital jungle. Sure, you can deploy your defenses, but they will always find a sneaky way around them while you drain your resources.</p>



<ul><li>You will use streaming service to gate-keep your videos, They can use a project similar to `youtube-dl` to download any video file.</li><li>You will block downloading images on the page, they can just take a screenshot.</li><li>You can password protect a PDF, they can use a „virtual printer” to generate a new, open one.</li></ul>



<p>If you give a customer <b>any way </b>to access the content, that way can also be used to copy that content and/or record it.</p>



<p>This is a fundamental feature of the Internet. Content is meant to be easily reproducible and shared. The only way to win is to make it easier and more compelling to pay.</p>



<h3>2 – You are treating your customer like a thief</h3>



<p>Imagine if visiting your friend was like going through airport security. Did you bring any liquids? What’s that in your backpack? Oh no, your belongings are 300 grams too heavy, better pay for extra luggage!</p>



<p>Jumping through DRM hoops is sending a clear message to all your customers:</p>



<p><i>We don’t trust you. You have to go through this process because we think you may steal something. We’re watching you.</i></p>



<p>This message gets sent whenever a person who decided to pay you opens their purchase. It’s your biggest fans’ first experience with your product.</p>



<h3>3 – People who steal are not your customers</h3>



<p>Do you have a portrait of your ideal customer?</p>



<p>Is it a teenager sitting in a warez bulletin board all day and polishing his torrent workflow? If not – <strong>why are you focusing on them?</strong></p>



<p>People who download loads of content are not used to paying for it. When they won’t be able to find a free copy of <u>your</u> content – they will steal from your competitor or resign before they open their wallets.</p>



<p>And if you don’t know who your ideal customer is – maybe you should focus on that.</p>

<h3>4 – But they may become them</h3>



<p>Sure Artur – but what about when somebody buys something and then gives away to all their friends?</p>



<ol type="a"><li>What do you think about sharing books? Borrowing a blender? Some sharing is healthy and natural.</li><li>It actually benefits <b>you</b>.</li></ol>



<p><b>Bootleg content is a customer acquisition mechanism.</b></p>



<p>The most successful Internet entrepreneurs build sophisticated sales funnels. For example, they would have many interactions with the customer before they buy:</p>



<ol><li>A visitor interested in your field finds your article online.</li><li>After the second article, they sign up for your email list.</li><li>You provide consistent value and build up trust.</li><li>After a few months, you release a product and the follower becomes a customer.</li><li>Profit.</li></ol>



<p>Even if they try to “convert” their friends to trust you too, the friend lacks the relationship you have built. They didn’t receive your emails and they didn’t laugh at your corny jokes.</p>



<p>Demonstrating the full value of intellectual property requires giving it away. Once the friend sees the value you provide, they will either:</p>



<ol type="a"><li>Be blown away by the quality.</li><li>Decide it’s not for them and they will never be your customer.</li></ol>



<p>Both of these outcomes are ideal for you and save you considerable time in the signup funnel and marketing.</p>



<p>This is what trial period and discounts aim to accomplish, but they have side-effects. When you repeatedly discount, customers start treating the lower price as the ‘real’ one, and value the product less because ‘it must not be worth the full price’. Keeping a blind eye to questionable behavior gives you a way out. You can demonstrate how valuable your product is, without discounts that lead to price erosion.</p>



<p>People who “sneak onboard” often become customers themselves – and even the most loyal ones! The converted always are.</p>



<h3>5 – You are making it hard to enjoy your content.</h3>



<p>Open standards empower creators to build new tools or use the content in unpredictable ways. Things are better connected. These are the core assumptions under which the Internet was built. You will not be able to predict all the weird, fantastic, and inspiring ways your content will be accessed.</p>



<ul><li>I may read your PDF on an iPad, iPhone, Android tablet, Kindle, or printed out,</li><li>I frequently save workout or yoga videos to watch while being offline in the garden or on the road,</li><li>I like to read the text in my Pocket or Kindle apps.</li></ul>



<p>Any sort of „protection” breaks my ways of consuming your content and often makes it useless for me. Sometimes enough to give up on something I have paid for (<i>and that is the reason I stopped doing yoga, your honor</i>).</p>



<div>
<h4>Sign up to get Deliberate Internet straight to your inbox</h4>
<p>I write about the psychological and technical aspects of the Internet, focusing on remote work, online economy, and cognitive load. Every monday.</p>






</div>



<h3>6 – You are blocking people with disabilities from accessing it at all.</h3>



<p>I can manage the inconvenience with some grumbling – however, not everybody has that luxury. Tools that people with disabilities rely on are by nature incompatible with any sort of content protection schemes. Content protection’s entire purpose is restricting access to the narrow subset of users and use cases.</p>



<p>Mind you, that <u>you yourself will join</u> those “people with disabilities”. You will get older, lose a little clarity in your vision, and suddenly the new sexy apps developed by 20-year olds in their glass palaces will become confusing and unusable.</p>



<p>Helping my grandparents navigate the changing digital landscape is a sad and sobering experience. Any additional hoop that you make them jump through may render your content inaccessible.</p>

We will have eyesight issues<br>– ❓ We will get confused by new concepts<br>– ✋ Our motor skills will be worse</p><p>Let's make tech a little kinder for our future selves, please ? <a href="https://t.co/qxzfO3gLRv">https://t.co/qxzfO3gLRv</a></p></div>— Artur Piszek (@artpi) <a href="https://twitter.com/artpi/status/1218477669916053506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 18, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<h3>7 – You are turning your creation into a commodity</h3>



<p>The best online businesses rely on fostering the relationship between you and your customers. You share some free content, they are more receptive to trust you with their hard-earned money. It’s a dance of mutual respect and the first sale is only a part. If they like what you are doing, they will return for more, or even support you financially.</p>



<p>DRM software turns this delicate relationship into buying a sack of coal under the watchful gaze of security. <i>Not even a fistful too much! You are being watched</i>.</p>



<p>You are signaling to your customer that this is a purely monetary transaction. They are not entitled to even sharing your work with a friend, because they would be violating rules ?. Oh, the rules.</p>



<h3>8 – Are you really losing anything?</h3>



<p>If you are selling digital products, what is your marginal cost? How much do you pay to create another copy of your PDF, video, software?</p>



<p>When your content is being shared, it is <u>not stealing.</u> You don’t lose your income whenever somebody downloads a copy. As I mentioned – people who are likely to download illegal copies of your work are either never going to be your customers, or they will because they had a peek.</p>



<h3>9 – What is your true motivation for blocking the content?</h3>



<p>What is the core motivation for trying to protect your piece? Is it some misplaced sense of justice or is it legitimately best for your customer?</p>



<p>If that content truly makes you proud and you believe it would help them – what is the best outcome if the customer does not want to pay? Is this motivation coming from a place of fear?</p>



<ul><li>Fear of your work being „not good enough” to pay for?</li><li>Fear of the offer not being compelling enough?</li><li>Fear of not having enough paying customers to make it all worthwhile?</li></ul>



<p>Fear is not a good place to create amazing content people are going to love. This mindset will drag you down and prevent you from soaring into creative skies.</p>



<h3>10 – What do you choose to believe about people?</h3>



<p>Do you really want to believe that people are only waiting for an opportunity to steal? Or do you want to trust them to appreciate the value you provide?</p>



<h2>What can you do instead</h2>



<ol><li>Focus on the relationship with the customer. I have written a little more about it in<a href="https://piszek.com/2020/02/03/hospitality-vs-commodity/"> Your product is either hospitality or a commodity</a>.<br>I believe that all kinds of digital goods will be commoditized sooner or later. The only “moat” you can build is the customers’ trust.</li><li>Put the energy you would spend on DRM into innovation and creating new products. Once your old one gets shared, you should be already releasing a new one.<br>Subscriptions are an effective form of protection here – instead of sharing your content once, you drip the value to the customer – and they see the benefits of paying you.</li><li>Sell more. Get more paying customers – after all, it’s about how many customers <b>choose to pay you</b>, not how many choose not to.</li><li>Raise prices. Focus on the customer who is not driven to pay less, but the one who is driven to get more value. Paradoxically, more expensive products get downloaded less.</li></ol>



<p><strong><em>Now go, create, and sell.</em></strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><strong><em>Note: this web article is an older version of a paper which has now been published as an ICFP Pearl. You can find a preprint of that paper <a href="https://lptk.github.io/simple-sub-paper">here</a>.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>It’s probably better to read the paper rather than this post, as the paper contains more material, is more up to date, and is better explained!</em></strong></p> <p><strong>Algebraic subtyping</strong> is a new approach to global type inference in the presence of subtyping. It extends traditional Hindley-Milner type inference while preserving the principal type property — that is, it can always infer <em>the</em> most general type for any given expression. This approach was developed by <a href="http://stedolan.net/about/">Stephen Dolan</a> as part of his PhD thesis, along with Alan Mycroft.</p> <p>Algebraic subtyping was implemented in <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sd601/mlsub/">the <strong>MLsub</strong> type inference engine</a>. However, the design of MLsub seems significantly more complex than the simple unification algorithms used for traditional ML languages. MLsub has proven harder to grasp, even for people already familiar with compilers and type systems, such as myself.</p> <p>Dissatisfied with this state of affairs, I wanted to get to the bottom of the algebraic subtyping approach. What really is special about it, beyond the formalism? What are the simple concepts that hide behind the strange notions of <em>biunification</em> and <em>polar types</em>?</p> <p>This article is an answer to those questions. I propose an alternative algorithm for algebraic subtyping, called <strong>Simple-sub</strong>. Simple-sub can be implemented <strong>efficiently</strong> in <strong>under 500 lines of code</strong> (including parsing, simplification, and pretty-printing), and I think it is much more familiar-looking and easier to understand than MLsub.</p> <h4 id="---you-can-try-simple-sub-online-here---"><strong>⇨ ⇨ ⇨ <em><a href="https://lptk.github.io/simple-sub/">You can try Simple-sub online here!</a></em> ⇦ ⇦ ⇦</strong></h4> <p>This article is meant to be light in formalisms and easy to consume for prospective designers of new type systems and programming languages.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/LPTK/simple-algebraic-subtyping">The complete source code of Simple-sub is available on Github.</a></p>   <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2> <ol> <li> <p><strong><a href="#intro">Introduction</a></strong></p> </li> <li> <p><strong><a href="#algebraic-subtyping-mlsub">Algebraic Subtyping in MLsub</a></strong></p> </li> <li> <p><strong><a href="#algebraic-subtyping-simple-sub">Algebraic Subtyping in Simple-sub</a></strong></p> </li> <li> <p><strong><a href="#simplifying-types">Simplifying Types</a></strong></p> </li> <li> <p><strong><a href="#conclusions">Conclusions</a></strong></p> </li> </ol> <hr>  <p>The ML family of languages, which encompasses Standard ML, OCaml, and Haskell, have been designed around a powerful “global” approach to type inference, rooted in the work of <a href="https://doi.org/10.2307%2F1995158">Hindley</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016%2F0022-0000%2878%2990014-4">Milner</a>, later closely formalized by <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/582153.582176">Damas</a>. In this approach, the type system is designed to be simple enough that types can be unambiguously inferred from terms without the help of any type annotations. That is, for any unannotated term, it is always possible to infer a <em>principal type</em> which subsumes all other types that can be assigned to this term. For instance, the term $\lambda{x}. {x}$ can be assigned types $\mathsf{bool} \to \mathsf{bool}$ and $\mathsf{int} \to \mathsf{int}$, but both of these are subsumed by the polymorphic type $\forall a.\ a \to a$, also written <code>'a -&gt; 'a</code>, which is the principal type of this term.</p> <p><strong><em>Hindley-Milner</em></strong> (HM) type inference contrasts with more restricted “local” approaches to type inference, found in languages like Scala and C#, which often require the types of variables to be annotated explicitly by programmers. On the flip side, abandoning the principal type property allows these type systems to be more expressive and to support features such as object orientation and first-class polymorphism. Note that in practice, even ML languages like OCaml and Haskell have adopted expressive type system features which, when used, break the principal type property.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p> <p><strong><em>Subtyping</em></strong> is an expressive feature allowing types to be structured into hierarchies (usually a subtyping <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(order)"><em>lattice</em></a>) with the property that types can be <em>refined</em> or <em>widened</em> transparently following this hierarchy. This lets us express the fact that some types are more precise (contain more information) than others, but still have a compatible runtime representation, so that no coercions between them are needed. For instance, in a system where the type <code>nat</code> is a subtype of <code>int</code>, one can transparently use a <code>nat list</code> in place where an <code>int list</code> is expected, without having to apply a coercion function on all the elements of the list. Subtyping can be emulated using somewhat heavy type system machinery (which both OCaml and Haskell occasionally do<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>), but first-class support for subtyping gives the benefit of simpler type signatures and better type inference.</p> <p>For a long time, it was widely believed that pervasive implicit subtyping got in the way of satisfactory global type inference. Indeed, previous approaches to inferring subtypes failed to support principal types or resulted in the inference of large, unwieldy typing schemes which included sets of complex constraints, making their understanding by programmers difficult.</p> <p><strong><em>Algebraic subtyping</em></strong> was introduced by Dolan and Mycroft as an ML-style type system supporting subtyping and global type inference, while producing compact principal types. Here, <em>compact</em> refers to the fact that the inferred types are relatively simple type expressions without any visible constraints, making them easy to understand by programmer. This was achieved by carefully designing the syntax and semantics of the underlying subtyping lattice, allowing for simplifying assumptions in to be made the constraint resolution process of the type inference algorithm.</p> <p>However, <em>biunification</em>, the algorithm proposed by Dolan in order to implement algebraic subtyping, has been quite difficult to understand for many experts and non-experts alike. Indeed, on the surface it looks quite different from the usual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system#Algorithm_J"><em>Algorithm J</em></a> traditionally used for Hm type systems: it requires several additional concepts, such as bisubstitution and polar types, making it look more complicated.</p> <p>Thankfully, it turns out that algebraic subtyping admits a type inference algorithm, which I called <em>Simple-sub</em>, that is very similar to the familiar Algorithm J, and also much more efficient than biunification (or at least, than the basic syntax-driven form of biunification.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> In this article, I show that inferring algebraic subtypes is actually extremely easy, and can be done in under 300 lines of Scala code. Most of the complexity actually comes from simplifying the inferred type representations, which we will get to later.</p> <p>While the implementation we present is written in Scala, it is straightforward to translate into any other functional programming language.</p> <p><strong><em>The goal of this article</em></strong> is to recast algebraic subtyping into a simpler mold, allowing more prospective designers of type systems and programming languages to benefit from the great insights that this approach offers.</p> <hr>  <p>Let’s start by briefly reviewing what algebraic subtyping and MLsub are and what they are not, and by trying to assess their expressiveness.</p> <h2 id="term-language">Term Language</h2> <p>The term syntax of MLsub is given below. I have omitted boolean literals and if-then-else, as they can easily be typed as primitive combinators. I also used only one form of variables $x$, which will be sufficient for our use (Dolan’s MLsub formalism distinguishes lambda-bound variables from let-bound variables for technical reasons).</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>name</th> <th>formal syntax</th> <th>ML pseudo-syntax</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>variable</td> <td>$x$</td> <td><code>x</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>lambda</td> <td>$\lambda{x}. {e}$</td> <td><code>fun x -&gt; e</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>application</td> <td>$e\ e$</td> <td><code>e e</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>record creation</td> <td>$\{\ l_0 = e \,;\; … \,;\; l_n = e\ \}$</td> <td><code>{ l_0 = e; ...; l_n = e }</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>field selection</td> <td>$e.l$</td> <td><code>e.l</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>let bindings</td> <td>$\mathsf{let}\ x = e\ \mathsf{in}\ e$</td> <td><code>let x = e in e</code></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h2 id="type-language">Type Language</h2> <p>The type syntax of MLsub, summarized below, consists in booleans, function types, record types, type variables, top $\top$ (the type of all values — supertype of all types), bottom $\bot$ (the type of no values — subtype of all types), type union $\sqcup$, type intersection $\sqcap$, and recursive types $\mu{\alpha}. {\tau}$.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>name</th> <th>formal syntax</th> <th>ML pseudo-syntax</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>primitives</td> <td>$\mathsf{bool}$, $\mathsf{int}$, …</td> <td><code>bool</code>, <code>int</code>, …</td> </tr> <tr> <td>function</td> <td>$\tau \to \tau$</td> <td><code>t -&gt; t</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>record</td> <td>$\set{\ l_0: \tau \,,\; … \,,\; l_n: \tau\ }$</td> <td><code>{ l_0: t, ..., t_n: t }</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>variable</td> <td>$\alpha $</td> <td><code>'a</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>top</td> <td>$\top$</td> <td><code>⊤</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>bottom</td> <td>$\bot$</td> <td><code>⊥</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>union</td> <td>$\tau \sqcup \tau$</td> <td><code>∨</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>intersection</td> <td>$\tau \sqcap \tau$</td> <td><code>∧</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>recursive</td> <td>$\mu\alpha. \tau$</td> <td><code>t as 'a</code></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h2 id="informal-semantics-of-types">Informal Semantics of Types</h2> <p>While most MLsub type forms are usual and unsurprising, two kinds of types require our special attention: set-theoretic types (more specifically union and intersection types), and recursive types.</p> <h3 id="set-theoretic-types">Set-Theoretic Types</h3> <p>To a first approximation, union and intersection types can be understood in set-theoretic terms: the type term $\tau_0 \sqcup \tau_1$ (resp. $\tau_0 \sqcap \tau_1$) represents the type of values that are <em>either</em> (resp. <em>both</em>) of type $\tau_0 $ <em>or</em> (resp. <em>and</em>) of type $\tau_1$.</p> <p>MLsub uses these types to indirectly constrain inferred type variables; for instance, one type inferred for term $\lambda{x}. {\set{l = x - 1 \,;\; r = x}}$ could be $\alpha \sqcap \mathsf{int} \to \set{l: \mathsf{int} \,,\; r: \alpha}$. This type reflects the fact that the original argument, of type $\alpha$, is returned in the $r$ field of the result record, as the input type $\alpha$ ends up in that position, but also that this argument should be able to be treated as an $\mathsf{int}$, expressed via the type intersection $\alpha \sqcap \mathsf{int}$ on the left-hand side of the function type. Keeping track of the precise argument type $\alpha$ is important: it could be later substituted with a more specific type than $\mathsf{int}$, such as $\alpha = \mathsf{nat}$, which would give us $\mathsf{nat} \to \set{l: \mathsf{int} \,;\; r: \mathsf{nat}}$.</p> <p>On the other hand, there may be type signatures where some $\alpha$ becomes undistinguishable from $\mathsf{int}$. For instance, consider the term $\lambda{x}. {\mathsf{if}\ \mathsf{true}\ \mathsf{then}\ {x - 1}\ \mathsf{else}\ {x}}$, whose simplified inferred type would be just $\mathsf{int} \to \mathsf{int}$, as the seemingly-more precise type $\alpha \sqcap \mathsf{int} \to \alpha \sqcup \mathsf{int}$ does not actually contain more information (see the MLsub paper for details).</p> <p>The beauty of algebraic subtyping is that this sort of reasoning scales to arbitrary flows of variables and higher-order functions; for instance, the previous example can be generalized by passing in a function $f$ to stand for the $\cdot - 1$ operation, as in …</p></div></div>

<p>This is just a story of my day. It was an incredibly boring day. Why do I write about it? I analyzed why it was so dull and uncovered a great insight. What is the most critical factor in software engineering productivity? I think it is the time it takes to deploy your app.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Beautiful start of the day</h2>



<figure><img src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-ad60c7827ccce42ea134acdb3a46d988.jpg" alt="The picture of an engineer writing code." srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-ad60c7827ccce42ea134acdb3a46d988.jpg 900w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-ad60c7827ccce42ea134acdb3a46d988-300x200.jpg 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-ad60c7827ccce42ea134acdb3a46d988-768x512.jpg 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-ad60c7827ccce42ea134acdb3a46d988-360x240.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></figure>



<p>I woke up at around 10 am. Not too bad, given that I’ve stayed late the night before – I have been trying to solve an engineering problem at work. The problem was adding a new feature to the gigantic project with a not so scalable architecture. The project was born out of the hackathon, so it’s nobody’s fault… Anyway, the engineering problem. It wasn’t even that hard because as soon as I woke up, I had it all figured out in my head. I just needed my morning coffee first.</p>



<p>I started coding right after my first sip. Something really happened in my head during sleep, because it felt so easy to write code. The solution was pretty obvious, and it did not introduce any unneeded complexity to an already chaotic code base. It looked good, so I ran the code locally. Oh, yes, I forgot to import the module here. Oops, this variable is NULL now, let’s fix that. Okay, it seems to work now. So I committed changes to my branch and created a PR. It’s 11 am on the clock. Pretty sweet as a start of the day, ha? Now what? Even if I solved the problem, it’s not going to do much good without getting into production. Now it’s time to get my code to the finish line.</p>



<p>My open PR had automatically triggered tests. We have all kinds of tests: unit, integration, code style, you name it. I knew I had some time because this process is not usually fast. However, I didn’t have enough time to shift my focus to another task or fully relax. So I kept on checking my messengers, social apps, and news feed. Then a message arrived in Slack. “Lint-check failed.” Oh, I hate those! I thought I had everything right! Okay, it looks like I forgot to remove this import, and it’s not used anymore. I removed one line from the code and committed my changes. 5 minutes wait, again. What’s going on on Twitter?</p>



<h2>We all hate waiting</h2>



<figure><img src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-40a3cf24fa0ff15d8ce804678017d6d3.jpg" alt="The picture of a man looking at his phone waiting for the code deploy to finish." srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-40a3cf24fa0ff15d8ce804678017d6d3.jpg 900w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-40a3cf24fa0ff15d8ce804678017d6d3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-40a3cf24fa0ff15d8ce804678017d6d3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-40a3cf24fa0ff15d8ce804678017d6d3-360x240.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></figure>



<p>I did not notice how 15 minutes passed. Then I got another slack message – integration tests failed. At least my code style is right. So, I spent another 5 minutes fixing the issue (integration test actually did an excellent job catching a tricky bug, so I’m not mad at it). Then I committed my changes and played the waiting game again.</p>



<p>I understand the importance of tests, but 20 minutes, come on! Of course, I could’ve made some progress on another task, meanwhile. No, not really. I don’t know about you, but I hate switching focus. It takes so much time to get into a really focused state. So I’ve checked all my apps on the phone a couple times and found the bottom of the twitter feed before I saw a Slack notification about the successful deployment of my code. </p>



<p>Just to be safe, I need to test the app on production to see if the new feature works. From first glance, it did, but there was a small glitch. I had to update the code in the UI of a web application, nothing fancy, just changing a string. This turned out to be a header on the page, and I added redundant whitespace at the beginning, so now it looks weird. Okay, here we go again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now all tests passed, but the deployment took forever. I’m not sure what kind of computation is involved in moving a folder with files around 10 megabytes from my laptop to the server, but it sure feels like it could’ve trained a conscious AI by now. I don’t remember how much time it took for me to refresh the page and finally see the whitespace disappear, but it definitely took another cup of coffee. I managed to check my emails during this time, so I was productive, I guess. Anyway, it’s 2 pm, and it’s time for lunch.</p>



<h2>How much time we waste</h2>



<figure><img src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-5dffa44220fae3cb575331fd82a7013a.jpg" alt="The picture of a clock to illustrate time we waste when the deploy is slow." srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-5dffa44220fae3cb575331fd82a7013a.jpg 900w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-5dffa44220fae3cb575331fd82a7013a-300x200.jpg 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-5dffa44220fae3cb575331fd82a7013a-768x512.jpg 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-5dffa44220fae3cb575331fd82a7013a-360x240.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></figure>



<p>As you may have noticed, I’m complaining. That day I really spent around 1 hour actually solving an engineering problem, including bug-fixing time. But it took me 4 hours until I saw my changes in production. There are many days like this, so time adds up. I feel righteous anger because this thing is common in the industry, and many people experience the same thing.</p>



<p>So, what’s the solution? Not writing tests? Of course, not, tests are freaking great. The issue is more generic – it’s all those inefficiencies that are easy to introduce to the deploy time (I bundle tests and all CI/CD stuff in the deploy time). It’s easy to write an inefficient CI/CD job. Its intent could be positive, and at the time, it may seem like a great idea. But a little delay is multiplied by the number of people working on the project and frequency of changes they make. Because deploy time affects EVERY contributor and EVERY code change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Slow deploy means slow feedback loops. Imagine you’re an artist. Now imagine each time you move your brush on the canvas, you need to wait 5 minutes before the paint appears. That would be the most annoying thing ever.</p>



<h2><strong>The feedback loop (deploy) has to be fast</strong></h2>



<figure><img src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-3b673bff843c3985e1f74841e58ef65d.jpg" alt="The picture of an artist that compares painting and seeing result with the feedback loop of software deploy." srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-3b673bff843c3985e1f74841e58ef65d.jpg 900w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-3b673bff843c3985e1f74841e58ef65d-300x169.jpg 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-3b673bff843c3985e1f74841e58ef65d-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></figure>



<p>I believe that each developer who likes to solve creative problems needs to have a fast feedback loop. You change the code – “snap” – it’s updated on the server – “snap” – you see the result.</p>



<p>Please think about this next time you want to add something to the deploy time. And also, think about improving deployment speed next time you work on technical debts. If you cut just 1 minute for a project with 5 contributors, each of them contributing once a day (only on workdays), it saves more than 100 hours a year. And I don’t know how to count improved productivity because of not having to switch the focus, but for me, it would multiply this time by 2 at least. To create better software, we need to improve how we write software.</p>



<p>PS. There is a great talk that inspired me&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/36579366">https://vimeo.com/36579366</a>. You should check it out, it’s mind-blowing.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This is a post in a series of posts :</p>
<br>
<div><p>
As my regular readers know I reluctantly trust anything that isn't tested and battle proof. In the last 2 years, I applied the same logic that I apply to vulnerability research to the Data Privacy environment and proceeded to test a broad range of Data Subject Rights. Expect a few disclosures following this one.</p><p>

In true Information Security Fashion (insiders will understand) have attributed this weakness the ID :</p><ul>
<li><b>CDPWE-0001 - Does not designate a Representative in the European Union</b></li>
</ul>
<h3>
Introduction</h3>
<br></div>
<p>
When I searched Google for my name an interesting website came up in the results. A company called "Rocket Reach" allowed others to buy access to my personal data. I was intrigued as I have never given any consent for Rocketreach to store (or even sell) my data and I saw no other legal basis for RocketReach processing of my data.</p>
<div>

<p>
"Rocket Reach" a data broker that describes it's service as :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
"Connect directly with the right decision makers, using the world's largest and most accurate database of emails and direct dials.&nbsp;Real-time verified data for 430 million professionals across 17 million companies, worldwide.Trusted by over 5.0 million users — powering sales, recruiting, and marketing at companies large and small.</p>
<p>
Prospect, connect and converse with your leads at scale."</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>



<h3>
Issuing a DSAR</h3>
</p>
<p>
On the <b>5th of April&nbsp; 2019</b>, I asked Rocketreach access to my personal data (Data Subject Access Request) and asked for the purpose and the legal basis of processing. Instead of giving me access to my data and reply adequately, RocketReach decided to <b>delete/remove all traces of it </b>and informed me that it did so the same day.</p>

<p>
While it might be surprising to some, this is actually a common reaction to DSARs when the Data Controller realizes the data they have may have no real legal basis.</p>
<br>
<h3>
Filing a complaint&nbsp;</h3>
<p>
On the <b>05th of April 2019</b>, I filed a complaint with the Luxemburgish Data Protection Agency (CNPD). The reference for this complaint is #3018 (For those that want to request information/documents from the CNPD).</p>

<h3>
Waiting for roughly a year</h3>
<br>
<h3>
"We agree with you but we can't do anything, sorry, move on"</h3>
<p>
On the <b>6th of March 2020</b>&nbsp;(<span>1 year!</span>) the CNPD responded as follows (Original Version on top, the Translated version at the bottom).</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p><span lang="FR">Monsieur Zoller,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="FR">La
 Commission nationale pour la protection des données (CNPD) se permet de
 revenir vers vous concernant votre réclamation du 5 avril 2019 à 
l’encontre de la société RocketReach.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="FR">Dans le cadre de l’instruction de votre réclamation, la 
société RocketReach nous a communiqué qu’elle considère que ce sont les 
utilisateurs de ses services, et non elle-même, qui sont les 
responsables du traitement pour ce qui concerne les
 données à caractère personnel traitées sur son site internet. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="FR">Par ailleurs, il ressort également de cette instruction 
que la société RocketReach est une société située aux Etats-Unis 
d’Amérique <b>ne disposant pas d’un représentant dans l’Union au sens de 
l’article 27 du règlement général sur la protection
 des données (RGPD). </b><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="FR">Au sujet des responsables du traitement établis dans des
 pays tiers, comme les Etats-Unis d’Amérique, nous souhaitons attirer 
votre attention sur le considérant (116) du RGPD qui précise que:</span></p>
<p>
«&nbsp;<i>Lorsque
 des données à caractère personnel franchissent
 les frontières extérieures de l'Union, cela peut accroître le risque 
que les personnes physiques ne puissent exercer leurs droits liés à la 
protection des données, notamment pour se protéger de l'utilisation ou 
de la divulgation illicite de ces informations.
 De même, les autorités de contrôle peuvent être confrontées à 
l'impossibilité d'examiner des réclamations ou de mener des enquêtes sur
 les activités exercées en dehors de leurs frontières. Leurs efforts 
pour collaborer dans le contexte transfrontalier peuvent
 également être freinés par les pouvoirs insuffisants dont elles 
disposent en matière de prévention ou de recours, par l'hétérogénéité 
des régimes juridiques et par des obstacles pratiques tels que le manque
 de ressources.&nbsp;»</i></p>
<p><span lang="FR">Dans le cas de votre réclamation cela signifie que, <b>bien
 que nous ne partagions pas le point de vue de RocketReach et que nous 
sommes au contraire d’avis que cette société est bien à considérer comme
 responsable du traitement pour les traitements
 de données à caractère personnel effectués sur son site internet, il 
nous est impossible de poursuivre plus en avant le traitement de votre 
réclamation</b>. En effet, nous ne disposons pas des pouvoirs de mener des 
enquêtes et de faire appliquer les décisions
 que nous serions amenés à prendre sur le territoire des Etats-Unis 
d’Amérique.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="FR">Nous sommes dès lors au regret de vous informer que nous
 considérons qu’il nous est impossible de poursuivre de façon effective 
le traitement de votre dossier.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="FR">Veuillez agréer, Monsieur Zoller, l’expression de nos sentiments distingués.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><b>English Translation</b><p>
Mr. Zoller, </p><p>The National Commission for Data Protection (CNPD) would like to get back to you regarding your complaint of 5 April 2019 against the company RocketReach. </p><p>Rocket Reach has informed us that <b>it considers that it is the users of its services, and not itself, who are responsible for processing personal data processed on its website</b>.  Furthermore, it also emerges from this instruction that RocketReach is a company located in the United States of America that does not have a representative in the Union within the meaning of Article 27 of the General Regulation on Data Protection (RGPD).&nbsp;</p> <p>As regards data controllers established in third countries, such as the United States of America, we would like to draw your attention to recital (116) of the DPMR which states that: 'When personal data crosses the external borders of the Union, this may increase the risk that individuals may not be able to exercise their data protection rights, in particular to protect themselves against unlawful use or disclosure of such information.</p><p>Similarly, supervisory authorities may be faced with the impossibility to investigate complaints or activities outside their borders. Their efforts to work together in the cross-border context may also be hampered by insufficient preventive or remedial powers, heterogeneous legal regimes and practical obstacles such as lack of resources. »&nbsp;</p> <p>In the case of your complaint, this means that, although <b>we do not share RocketReach's view and to the contrary believe <span>that RocketReach is the data controller</span> </b>for the processing of personal data on its website, <b>we are unable to take any further action in relation to your complaint.</b> We do not have the authority to investigate and enforce any decision we would have to take in the United States of America.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>We regret to inform you that we consider it impossible for us to proceed with the processing of your case.</b></p></blockquote>
<div><p>In Summary -&nbsp; Rocketreach has <b>not met the requirement</b> of the GDPR to name an EU representative (Art27) to account for the processing of European Personal Data. <b>In their answer, the CNPD makes it sound like it is optional, it isn't.</b> Instead of pursuing Rocketreach locally on that basis alone, the CNPD just gives up arguing it has no jurisdiction in the US.</p></div>

<p><span>In other words, just don't designate a representative in Europe, build your business model around the exploitation of data from millions of European data subjects and you are fine?</span></p>

<p>
I&nbsp; am fully aware that I could engage in legal procedures myself.&nbsp; That's not in my interest (in this case). The overall question you should ask is: Do we need a European Institution that handles extra-territorial investigations and fines? <b>Why should it take the time, money, and energy from an individual when the DPA is supposed to defend the rights of the data subjects</b>?</p>
<p>
What the CNPD could have done according to [1]</p><ul>
<li><span><span>to impose a temporary or definitive limitation including a ban on processing;</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>to order the suspension of data flows to a recipient in a third country or to an international organisation.</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>to impose an administrative fine pursuant to Article 83, in addition to, or instead of measures referred to in this paragraph, depending on the circumstances of each individual case;</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>to order the controller or processor to bring processing operations into compliance with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate, in a specified manner and within a specified period;</span></span></li>
</ul>

[1]&nbsp;<a href="https://cnpd.public.lu/en/commission-nationale/pouvoirs.html">https://cnpd.public.lu/en/commission-nationale/pouvoirs.html</a></p><p>
Instead, Rocketreach just continues to sell the personal data of millions of European data subjects like nothing ever happened.

		<p>I was on <a href="https://www.insideedition.com/zombie-animals-encounters-terrifying-creatures-rise-42966">Inside Edition last week to talk about zombies</a>.</p>
<p>That’s a weird sentence to type.</p>
<p>While the story was dramatic, television clips are notoriously difficult to discuss anything of real significance. I had two main messages I wanted to get across.<strong> One</strong>, that we can’t be sure what these animals are suffering from just by appearance (this message kind of got missed in the clips they chose) and because of that, message <strong>two</strong>: you shouldn’t approach a potentially diseased animal yourself, but instead call animal control or your local wildlife professionals to come help (at least they did include me saying not to approach these animals).</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/lGACWoZL0-PNLWs0LGJsYz8XoSs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WHSNF332IQZR5MZDXT5VKCWWTA.jpg" alt="" width="322" height="410"><figcaption>A “zombie” raccoon, probably infected with canine distemper virus. Photo by Robert Coggeshall.</figcaption></figure>
<p>In all likelihood, most of the animals they showed and that have been recently been <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/zombie-raccoons-are-terrorizing-city-youngstown-ohio-180968704/">“terrorizing” individuals in Youngstown, Ohio</a> are suffering from infection with <a href="https://www.avma.org/public/PetCare/Pages/Canine-Distemper.aspx">canine distemper virus</a>. This is a virus related to human measles, and like measles, is very contagious. From the name, it obviously affects dogs, but isn’t limited to only dogs. It can also infect raccoons, foxes, opossums, ferrets, and even wild <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/extinction-countdown/canine-distemper-could-wipe-out-siberian-tigers/">tigers</a>. Among animals, the distemper virus can be transmitted by bites or simple close contact, so it can spread quickly within groups of animals living together. The infected animals then either recover and develop immunity, or pass away from the infection.</p>
<p>The animals exhibiting “zombie” symptoms like those shown in the clip are just the tip of the iceberg. It’s likely that many other animals in the local population are also ill, but perhaps not dramatically so; like any infectious disease, there will be a spectrum of symptoms in infected individuals, so not every wild animal infected with canine distemper will “go zombie.”</p>
<p>Wildlife authorities have noted that these outbreaks of animals acting like “zombies” happen every few years: the virus will sweep through a population lacking <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-unforgiving-math-that-stops-epidemics-20171026/">herd immunity</a>, infect many of the individuals, and those who are infected but recover will be immune. A few years later, when the population again contains large numbers of susceptible individuals due to births of new animals, the virus can again cause an outbreak—and the cycle continues over and over.</p>
<p>While canine distemper infection doesn’t cause symptoms in humans, <a href="https://www.avma.org/public/Health/Pages/rabies.aspx">rabies absolutely does</a>—and that’s a key reason people need to avoid these animals and leave them to the professionals. Based on the symptoms alone, you can’t tell if an aggressive, strangely-behaving animal is suffering from distemper or rabies. And while distemper isn’t harmful to humans (though it <a href="https://pets.webmd.com/dogs/canine-distemper#1">definitely could be to your dog</a> if they’re not up-to-date on their vaccinations), rabies is almost 100% fatal if not quickly treated with anti-rabies immunoglobulin and prophylactic vaccination. In the rare cases who have survived after symptoms developed, it was only with <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5350a1.htm">extreme interventions</a> which are <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/six-year-old-dies-rabies-after-experimental-treatment-milwaukee-protocol-fails-782168">not always able to be replicated</a>.</p>
<p>Expect to see these epidemics of “zombie animals” on a regular basis in different locations around the country—but don’t try to be a hero. That never turns out well in the movies.</p>

Peters sees stuff that no-one else can see, reports findings that no-one else finds, perpetually declares everyone else to be wrong, is vastly prolific, and has been very, very good at sharing and disseminating his stuff online. If Peters were reliable, trustworthy, careful, conscientious, and good at doing science, this would be great, and he would be a significant force for good. </p><p>But Peters is not reliable, or careful, or conscientious, or good at doing science. He is the opposite of those things. And yet he’s on a crusade whereby he aims to share his views – proclaimed by him as representing The Truth – as widely and frequently as possible, all the while decrying the mainstream palaeontological world as if it’s part of a conspiratorial cabal of blinkered elites. Peters is a significant source of miseducation, whose work floods the internet, and who aims to bamboozle those unaware that he’s peddling nonsense.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595584636582_546745"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595526977752_35989"><p>But at some point between the late 1990s and early 2000s, it became clear from his online writings and published articles that Peters had become <em>very strange</em>. Thanks to a unique kind of magic, super-powered vision, he claimed to find hitherto undetected babies, soft-tissue frills, umpteen new anatomical structures <em>and more</em> on pterosaur fossils. These claims were awfully reminiscent of those fringe announcements on the finding of skulls and bits of technology in NASA’s photographs of Mars or the moon, or of Jon-Eric ‘the fruitbat’ Beckjord’s proposals that frames of the Patterson-Gimlin film reveal hidden Bigfoots lurking in the shadows. Today, the Peters of 2020 thinks that at least some of these claims – documented in Peters (2004) and reported at conferences (e.g., the 2003 Society of Vertebrate Paleontology meeting at San Antonio, Texas, the 2006 Flugsaurier meeting at Munich) – should be ignored as “rookie mistakes” or “old laundry”. Making mistakes is part of science, we all do it. But claiming with confidence (in print and at conferences) that you’ve found a ton of incredible stuff that others have not is a red flag, especially when the Peters technique of finding stuff that on-one else can has the vile, distinct stench of pseudoscience about it. And despite arguments that those weird claims of the past were “rookie mistakes” or “old laundry”, the fact is that Peters has never stopped doing whatever it is that he does.</p></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595526977752_41793"><div>

By now, the proverbial cat (a vampire cat, covered in hitherto unseen babies and sporting a <em>Longisquama</em>-like frill of dorsal plumes and with a previously unnoticed long, tassel-tipped tail) was out of the bag, and it became less easy – although not impossible – for Peters to get his stuff into the literature, and presented at conferences. Several of his manuscripts – I believe submitted to such journals as <em>Nature</em> and <em>Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology</em> and mostly aimed at tackling big picture issues of reptile phylogeny – were rejected at around this time (for the record, I have not ever, not once, acted as a reviewer for a Peters paper).</p></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595584636582_203035"><div>

He stepped up his game online, giving us the outpouring that is ReptileEvolution.com and the updated daily, twice daily, thrice daily, infinity-times daily blog The Pterosaur Heresies. Though starting this grand online project with pterosaurs as his focus, Peters has expanded his interest to include reptiles of all sorts, mammals, all tetrapods and FISH as well. To those mammal, bird and fish experts who didn’t care about Peters when he was just ‘that weird pterosaur guy’, I say… well, now you know what it’s like.</p></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595584636582_92439"><div>

He is instead on some kind of eternal crusade to promote promote promote his ideas CEASELESSLY. I can confirm from working with students, the interested public and even other qualified scientists that his stuff is often assumed to be real science, on equal footing with that of those he criticises.

<h4>Gout termed as rich man’s disease caused a significant impact in Europe and US&nbsp;history.</h4>

<p>The king of the Holy Roman Empire laid siege on the city of Metz in France. The blockade would have been an instant victory if the king had barged into the city. Severe pain in his feet delayed the king to start an offensive. The delay caused the king to lose the battle. The entire European monarchy crashed with it. The Kings’s pain was due to a disease that impacted European history for years to come. The condition was Gout, also called as Foot grabber.</p>



<p>Gout has been part of the royal disease list for centuries. Gout is inflammation in bone joints and termed as the Arthritis of the rich. Gout has affected a meager portion of the world population but has influenced some of the world’s significant political events. Gout occurs due to excessive meat and alcohol consumption, which is the trademark of Europe’s aristocratic life. Gout is mostly formed in the feet and caused unbearable pain.</p>



<h4>Charles V’s Gout Problem and Fall of&nbsp;Europe:</h4>



<figure><img src="https://interestinghistoryforall.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/00cf6-0pfleiado4dmcexib.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Charles V.Source-Wikipedia</figcaption></figure>



<p>Charles V was the Holy Roman Empire in Europe and waged war against the French and led a successful crusade. During one of his campaigns, Charles V laid siege on the crucial town of Metz in France. Metz was the last major town in French control. Charles V had the habit of exhaustive drinking and meat consumption due to which Gout developed in his leg. On the siege day due to unbearable Gout pain, Charles V stopped the offensive and took rest. During the period of rest, the French reinforced the town. When he recovered and went for an invasion, Charles V lost the battle. After the loss and due to Gout pain Charles V abdicated the throne and split the Holy Roman Empire among his son and brother. Gout brought in the Holy Roman Empire’s downfall and cut Europe into two factions the Spanish Habsburgs and Austrian Habsburgs.</p>

<h4>William Pitt, the Elder, and US Independence:</h4>

<p>William Pitt, the Elder, was a British parliamentarian who influenced the British parliament. He was the grandson of the famous Thomas Diamond Pitt. William had Gout from a young age and skipped college graduation due to it. William Pitt spoke for the rights of the people in the American colony. When the British parliament voted on imposing taxes on tea, William Pitt spoke against the bill. He convinced many members to vote against the law. Unfortunately, on the final day of the debate, William could not attend the session, which passed the tax bill.<br>The high tax on tea created the Boston tea party and ultimately sown the seeds for the American revolution. Had Gout not caught William that day, American independence would not have happened.</p>



<p>Other famous personalities who had Gout are Cosmo de Medici, Benjamin Franklin, and Henry VIII.</p>



<p>Physicians came up with remedies to the Gout issue with stool or glass boot, but the relief was temporary. Gout got its portrayal as a rich man’s disease due to its patient history.</p>

            <p>
	Churches in Montreal are becoming concerned about hosting community groups after being hit with bills for municipal taxes.</p>
<p>
	Joel Coppetiers, the Minister at the Cote des Neiges Presbyterian church, was shocked when his institution first received a municipal tax bill in early 2015.</p>
<p>
	It was "the first indication that something had changed," said Coppetiers.</p>
<p>
	Provincial law exempts churches and manses from paying municipal taxes but Coppetiers was told that if a manse is vacant for several months between ministers, it's taxable.</p>
<p>
	Following that, city officials arrived for an inspection of every room in the church and how they were used.</p>
<p>
	"The indication is there's not an exemption for the church as a whole, there's only an exemption for those areas used for public worship and things directly related to it," said Coppetiers.</p>
<p>
	As a result, many churches in Montreal that host community groups, such as food banks, or Girl Guides or Boy Scouts, are facing mounting tax bills.</p>
<p>
	Coppetiers says the city has changed how it interprets the law.</p>
<p>
	"We're there to care and serve the community and this is part of it," said Coppetiers.</p>
<p>
	Coppetiers says taxes are due even when services are suspended for renovations.</p>
<p>
	The amount owed in taxes can increase swiftly if a church closes its doors.</p>
<p>
	When <a href="http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/trinity-memorial-church-in-ndg-closes-its-doors-1.3302321">Trinity Memorial Church in NDG </a>closed earlier this year, the city started enacting taxes immediately following the last service.</p>
<p>
	As a result churches feel pressured to sell swiftly, with Trinity Memorial being sold to Stanford Properties Group within two months.</p>
<p>
	The issue of places of worship owing taxes and fighting the city's exemptions office came as a surprise to city politicians, including Councillor Peter McQueen.</p>
<p>
	"Already our churches are in danger, they're having a number of financial problems and this is a further low blow," said McQueen.</p>
<p>
	The NDG councillor said his party, Projet Montreal, will study the exemption issue, but he said Montreal's Executive Committee needs to step up.</p>
<p>
	"If we don't do something you're going to see churches closed, churches possibly torn down, heaven forbid, certainly converted away from community use," said McQueen.</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile churches across the island are praying that the city will cease surprising them with taxes they can't afford.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      

<p>Last Sunday the 19th July 2020 I launched <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a>, a Decentralised, Self-Hosted, Twitter™-like microBlogging Platform.</p>

<p>You can read about my previous <a href="https://www.prologic.blog/2020/07/20/ann-announcing-twtxtnet.html">Announcing twtxt.net post</a>.</p>

<p>Today however I want to share more about <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> and the software behind it <a href="https://github.com/prologic/twtxt">prologic/twtxt</a>; Why I’ve done all this, Why it is important to me and Why you should care.</p>

<p>——</p>

<h2 id="background-story">Background Story</h2>

<p>So before we go into the Why and How, let’s first of all talk about how we go here in the first place.</p>

<p>Back in ~2015 I got head hunted by <a href="https://facebook.com/">Facebook</a>™ and after turning them down twice (<em>three was a bit much!</em>) I accepted the offer and relocated my family to the Bay Area at the Menlo Park HQ ala Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>There I spent ~3.5yrs as a Production Engineer (<em>Google it, or think DevOps/SRE if you’re unfamiliar, but not an apt description</em>).
Meanwhile, while I was <em>trying</em> to be good at my new found ay job, interesting developments were happening in the Social Media industry. Not only was Facebook copping flack for the Cambridge Analytics series of events, but <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>™ was going through some changes as well…</p>

<p>Twitter (_allegedly, although I never really got into Twitter myself…)( was introducing new automated algorithms to change what users on their platform saw on their timeline. This has significant impact on usability of the original intended use of the platform. Naturally <em>some</em> users did not like this and sought out other avenues and solutinos.</p>

<p>One such avenue was <a href="https://github.com/bucket">bucket</a>’s <a href="https://twtxt.readthedocs.org/">twtxt</a>. As I understand it he created a very simple file format specification, a canonical client and unleashed this onto the world! 👏</p>

<p>This was all around ~2016. I was too busy at Facebook to notice :)</p>

<h2 id="present-day-2020">Present Day (2020)</h2>

<p>Fast forward to ~2020 (<em>20th July 2020 to be exact</em>) and a few weeks earlier while I was on holidays I was up late one night just poking around on the Internet (<em>as you do</em>) and looking for “Decentralized Social Media” software. I found quite a few; here are some of the better known ones:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://diasporafoundation.org/">Diaspore</a></li>
<li><a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Some other not so well known ones:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">ScuttleButt</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gnusocial.network/">GNU Social</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This this very blog’s underlying platform <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a> where I now write and publish longer pieces like on my <a href="https://prologic.blog/">Blog</a></p>

<p>There’s even an article on Wired entitled <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/decentralized-social-networks-sound-great-too-bad-theyll-never-work/">Decentralised Social Networks Sound Great. Too Bad They’ll Never Work</a>! Well I’m here to tell you  I formally challenge this and am here to throw the gauntlet down! 🧤</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By the way… I <em>might</em> have caught twtxt sooner back in ~2018 when I got back from the US, but I was also (<em>at that time</em>) too busy moving around, working and trying to get bak into our family home that was still being rented at the time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As I said I launched <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> (<em>the first of what I hope will be many instances</em>) on Sunday the 19th July 2020. I wrote the software <a href="https://github.com/prologic/twtxt">prologic/twtxt</a> in just a few short weekends in my “spare time” and licensed it under the very permissive MIT license.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>📕 If you haven’t already checked it out, created an account and played around. I would encourage you to do so! I run a freely available for anyone to use instance over at <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are non-technical and read this far… Firstly congratulations I like you already! Second, don’t worry, <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> is just a platform to voice/share your thoughts, wisdoms, rambling, short-form text or anything else you want. Think of it like a miniature Facebook or Twitter but without all the advertising or tracking.</p>

<p>I believe in this very simple analogy:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you buy a diary and a Parker™ Pen.
If you then write down your thoughts, wisdoms, experiences, rambling or whatever you want to and share this with others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who owns what you have written? The manufacturer of the paper? The manufacturer of the diary? The manufacturer of the pen?</p>

<p>🤔</p>

<h3 id="so-why-why-should-i-use-twtxt-net">So why? Why should I use twtxt.net?</h3>

<p>You should use <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> if you are the type of person that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enjoys writing and sharing interesting things with others.</li>
<li>Just have interesting things to say in general. Knowledge and Wisdom should be shared!</li>
<li>Are tired of all the issues of all the <strong>BIG</strong> Social Media giants that now plague the f<em>, g</em> and t*.</li>
<li>No longer <em>wish</em> to be the product of Facebook or Twitter and want to <strong>own</strong> your own posts and interactions.</li>
</ul>

<p>See whilst <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> is brand spanking new, there are a few principles that will always remain true even now and going forward:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>NO</strong> User behaviour tracking of any kind.</li>
<li><strong>NO</strong> Advertising anywhere  of any kind.</li>
<li>Absolutely <strong>must</strong> be capable of being self-hosted.</li>

<h3 id="so-how-will-you-make-any-money">So how will you make any money?!</h3>

<p>Good question! Glad you asked. I probably won’t! But one of my primary goals is for users to “Self Host”.</p>

<p>What does this mean?</p>

<p>Well it simply means that you run your own server instance of the software that is behind <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a non-technical person (<em>which would be true of most people as there are only about ~1M software developers in the world</em>) then you’re probably asking yourself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But how do I do this?! I don’t know anything about computers! I just use apps!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well don’t worry. Even through (<em>at the time of writing this</em>) it’s really early days for <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> there are plans for the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>A paid single-user instance of <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> that is <strong>your very own</strong>, personalised to you, with your own domain name but with all the same features.</li>
<li>A paid multi-user instance of <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> with all the same features but more suitable to small communities, schools, villages, neighbourhoods, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>How much will this cost when it becomes available? Short answer is I don’t know. But I can tell you this, it will cost you less than what you are paying for Facebook and Twitter today (<em>remember that even through the f<em>, t</em>, g* are all FREE, there is an implicit cost, which is to say that you are implicitly paying for it as you are their product!</em>).</p>

<p>Let’s just say that once we’re ready to launch single-click hosted instances for the masses that it will cost you next to nothing. And if you can’t pay for your own instance, just use a friend’s instance or jump on any other instance you can find like <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a>!</p>

<h2 id="twtxt-net-today">twtxt.net Today</h2>

<p>So let’s talk about what <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> can do for you today.</p>

<p>Today you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Signup as a new user at <a href="https://twtxt.net/register">https://twtxt.net/register</a></li>
<li>Login at <a href="https://twtx.net/login">https://twtx.net/login</a></li>
<li>Make your first post by entering some prose of wisdom in the text box and hitting Submit!</li>
<li>You can follow other feeds by entering a Nickname for the feed and their URL in <a href="https://twtxt.net/follow">https://twtxt.net/follow</a></li>
<li>You can discover other users on the same instance as you by going to <a href="https://twtxt.net/discover">https://twtxt.net/discover</a></li>
<li>You can find interesting external feeds and even external users outside of the instance you’re on by going to <a href="https://twtxt.net/feeds">https://twtxt.net/feeds</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And most of all. You can have engaging, fun and interesting interactions with all sorts of people! <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> (<em>at the time of writing this</em>) is growing at a rate of ~2-3K requests per day and 3-5 new user signups per day. WOW! 😱</p>

<h2 id="twtxt-net-tomorrow">twtxt.net Tomorrow</h2>

<p>Now there’s still loads more work to do and all of this is happening in “spare time”. No one is paying me or contributors to do any of this. We do this out of the love and kindness of our hearts 💚</p>

<p>Nevertheless progress will continue and here’s what we have planned already:</p>

<ul>
<li>a Native Mobile iPhone / iOS App! 🎉</li>
<li><code>@mentions</code> where you can easily see who has mentioned you in a post (<em>we call them <code>twt</code>s</em>)</li>
<li><code>#hashtag</code> searching where you can see other similar posts that users tag.</li>
<li>Always continuing to improve the UI/UX and overall user experience.</li>
<li>Uploading images/photos! 📷 This will come pretty quickly actually because there is already a demand for this!</li>
<li>Instance&lt;-&gt;Instance interactions. Basically strengthening the first-class decentralised nature of <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a>. 👌</li>
</ul>

<p>——</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>So <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> is a <strong>FREE</strong> new type of Social Media that has a strong focus on Self-Hosting, Decentralisation without any of the bloat, tracking or advertising that we’ve all come to take for granted.</p>

Come, follow me down into the realm of gloom.” Goethe, <em>Faust</em></strong></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">In 1939, <em>Minneapolis Journal </em>photographer David Dornberg went on a “Camera Safari,” as he called it, through a large cave under downtown Minneapolis. He described it as “a ‘lost world,’ weird and spooky—the darkest spot for adventure into which my four years as a Journal cameraman ever led me.” Some may discount this as sensationalistic tripe, but read the testimony of Roger Kehret, a seasoned Minnesota caver with years of experience, in his 1974 booklet, <em>Minnesota Caves of History and Legend</em>: “When cavers think of remote hard to reach caves it brings to mind scenes of high mountains of the Pacific Northwest or the steaming jungles of the Amazon. The most remote and hard to get to cave that I have ever reached is found on Fourth Street near Marquette Avenue in down town Minneapolis, Minnesota.” This chapter describes my own ordeal to reach this lost world.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">Schieks Cave, as it has become known among urban explorers, has also been called “Loop Cave,” “Manhole Cave,” or “Farmers &amp; Mechanics Bank Cave.” It got the name from Schieks Palace Royale, a gentlemen’s club that now occupies the Farmers &amp; Mechanics Bank building, under which the cave is located. Journalist Kay Miller once described the nightclub as “topless above, bottomless below” because of the underlying cave, but there’s no humanly enterable physical connection between them.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">Schieks Cave is the largest natural cave under downtown Minneapolis, extending for a city block through the St. Peter Sandstone. Carl J. Illstrup, city sewer engineer, who discovered the cave in 1904, described it as a “cave shaped like an inverted bowl,” a description that seems puzzling to anyone who has actually been there. (It’s shaped more like a pancake that has gone awry on the griddle, if that helps.) In 1931, an enthusiastic journalist, Fitzsimmons, waxed poetical about “the beauties of the sewer system” and described Illstrup as “the ruler of this fantastic world.” The discovery of the cave in 1904, during which the crews braved “the lethal breath of deadly gases,” is presented as the highpoint of Illstrup’s life.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">The earliest known documentation of Schieks Cave is the 1904 Lund survey, which is good for showing the former “creeks” and “lakes” of the cave. Reportedly, the cave was kept a secret for years because city officials feared the public would think downtown Minneapolis was built on a thin shell that would plunge into a hole in the earth. Another concern was that burglars might have worked undetected and bored directly into the bank’s treasure vaults. By 1921 it was reported that “The entire business portion of the city is built over a series of subterranean lakes and caverns as mysterious and baffling as the Mammoth caves of Kentucky or catacombs of Rome.” The 1929 Lawton survey depicts the cave extensively modified by the construction of piers, walls, and artificial drainage systems. It also shows the 75-foot entrance shaft on Fourth Street and the 15-foot shaft from the cave to the underlying North Minneapolis Tunnel, a sanitary sewer.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;"><img src="http://gregbrick.org/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/DornbergMapLR.28352226_std.jpg" alt="1939 Dornberg map" width="738" height="631" data-mce-src="/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/DornbergMapLR.28352226_std.jpg"></span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">In 1952 the Twin Cities Grotto, local chapter of the National Speleological Society, visited Schieks Cave, and it was written up for the Sunday supplements. The late architectural historian David Gebhard, author of many architectural guidebooks, was a member of this club. In 1983, a successor organization, the Minnesota Speleological Survey (MSS), visited the cave, and their lurid account of the gloomy cave whose walls were black with cockroaches, and the roaring sewer that ran under it, only fired my enthusiasm to get there someday—one way or another. Perhaps even by climbing up from the sewers rather than down from the streets?</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">The earliest published account of someone visiting Schieks Cave without official sanction has been quoted above. In a chapter titled, “The Minnesota Rovers Great Manhole Cave Expedition,” Kehret went on to reveal how the Rovers, an outing club, dressed as sewer workers, surrounded the entrance manhole with barricades, and used a truck-mounted winch to remove the heavy, hexagonal lid (which in recent years has been welded shut). Getting there must have been more than half the fun, however, because Kehret said little about the cave itself, except that it was “almost filled with sand, concrete, pipes and other debris.”</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">In 1993, John and I examined the storm drains under the Minneapolis loop with the hope of getting into Schieks Cave. Located far below street level, the system drains to the Mississippi River by a large outfall in the milling district. With reference to the most famous sewer of Antiquity, it’s the very “Cloaca Maxima” of Minneapolis. Because no connection from the storm drains to the cave, or to the sanitary sewer known to run under the cave, was found, we shelved the project. Shortly thereafter I left for the University of Connecticut, where I did graduate work on barite mines.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">In 1996 a college student, along with several friends, began a series of attempts to get to Schieks Cave. He created a website, perhaps the first of its kind in this area, called “Minneapolis Draining Archive,” where he posted trip reports of these and other adventures. After exploring the storm drains without result, he tried wading upstream in the North Minneapolis Tunnel (NMT). This sanitary sewer, eight feet in diameter, carries the great river of human waste from the Loop, and runs directly under the cave, as noted above.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">NMT is the very gut of Minneapolis. Wading upstream is fatiguing owing to the swift, chest-deep current (2.5 feet per second), and the well-lubricated invert (floor). Occasionally one of them would lose his footing, even to the extent of full immersion in the warm, gray fluid, and get swept back to the starting point. He persevered to the extent of going two city blocks, with four blocks remaining to get to the cave. In desperation, he considered driving climbing pitons into the sewer walls, but nothing came of it. While NMT has been called a lot of things over the years, my favorite was the “Silk Road,” an allusion, you might imagine, to all the little bits of toilet tissue swirling through there. It took an effort to maintain a sense of humor in such grim surroundings.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">In 1999,<em> National Geographic Adventure</em> magazine commissioned a writer to report on urban exploration, which came to focus on the efforts to get to Schieks Cave. By this time I had met him and we agreed to join forces. I advocated an “upstream strategy”: to find a safe entrance to NMT upstream from the cave and “go with the flow,” rather than buck the current. The summer of 1999 was devoted to this task. In keeping with the magazine’s hip, youthful, target audience, however, my critical role in the exploration, without which it would not have succeeded, was to be downgraded to that of a “wizened elder” who “smokes cheap cigars.” All the locations appearing in the photo shoot, for example, were picked by me, and I was the only person who knew how to access them. But I was in my thirties at the time, a bit too long in the tooth for their demographic. By contrast, the youthful explorer was compared with world-renowned physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, apparently for things like crafting a make-shift sewer canoe out of “an old file cabinet.”</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">The first upstream entry point we investigated was the venerable Bassett Creek Tunnel. Running below this storm tunnel for a short distance was a sanitary sewer, the whole thing forming somewhat of a double-decker arrangement. The plan was to drop into the lower tunnel and head downstream to the cave. But upon removing the lids in the floor of the upper tunnel, and allowing the mephitic vapors to exhale, we got cold feet. The sewage just seemed to be moving too fast down there.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">More to be feared, however, was the inferred existence of a waterfall at some point along the sewer line. While at Bassett Creek the sanitary sewer was somewhat near street level, at Schieks Cave, NMT is 90 feet down. Somewhere along the way there had to be a big drop. And the small-scale sewer maps that we had didn’t indicate details of this nature.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">Tracing the sanitary sewer downstream by peeping through the holes on manhole lids, we found a “good lid” farther along, on a little used side street. The sewage was not moving so fast here, but it appeared deeper. Surrounding the manhole with orange cones, we descended a rope ladder and walked downstream. My thigh waders soon overtopped and filled with sewage, so that I appeared to have elephantiasis. Condoms, distended with raw sewage, dangled from the vaults above our heads. The hypothetical waterfall, located near Déjà Vu Nightclub, proved very real. Affixing a safety line to a pipe jutting from the walls, we approached the slippery brink of the cataract and peered into the abyss. I recalled the ending of Edgar Allan Poe’s <em>Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym</em>, where a chasm opened to swallow the hapless explorers.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">This sanitary waterfall marked the beginning of the deep NMT proper. From here, NMT ran under Schieks Cave and then on towards the treatment plant. We saw ladder rungs in the wall of the dropshaft, in the midst of the waterfall. We briefly toyed with the notion of sealing ourselves in trash bags, diverting the waterfall, and descending the ladder, but it all seemed just a bit too weird. Such situations are dangerous for another reason, namely, that the turbulence of the splattering sewage causes deadly gasses to bubble off. We gave up on that approach.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">In August, 1999, we investigated another tributary of NMT, running under the warehouse district. We found good lids situated among deserted construction sites, but here again we faced the daunting prospect of a waterfall. Soon after, the young explorer returned to the manhole with his buddies, descended into the tributary on a …</span></p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <div>

<p>Last week, my dad was asking me why I was proud of this triangle on my laptop.</p>
<p><img src="https://liamhinzman.com/img/vkTriangle.jpg"></p>
<p>I told him that rendering a triangle is complicated: it took me 3 days, and 1000+ lines of code to create the above image. This just made him more confused.</p>
<p>So I wrote this article explaining what the Vulkan graphics API is, how it works, and everything that goes into rendering a triangle with your GPU.</p>
<h2 id="what-vulkan-is">What Vulkan Is</h2>
<p>Vulkan is a graphics API that is designed to provide an accurate abstraction of how modern graphics processing units (GPUs) work. Unlike OpenGL, Vulkan is very verbose. Every detail related to the graphics API needs to be set up from scratch. The upsides to this are that you only use what you choose to, and you can better understand what’s going on in your application and in doing so achieve much higher performance.</p>
<p>This article is intended to be a concise overview of the fundamentals of Vulkan. It was written for somebody who knew Vulkan but has forgotten many of the details (i.e.&nbsp;future me). Most of the information here comes from the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2/html/vkspec.html">Vulkan 1.2 Spec</a>.</p>
<p>Note: This article uses the <a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Hpp/">C++ bindings</a> for Vulkan</p>
<h2 id="vulkan-in-a-nutshell">Vulkan in a Nutshell</h2>
<p><em>From a bird’s eye view, here’s how a Vulkan application works:</em></p>
<p>Vulkan can access <strong>devices</strong>, which let you control one or more <strong>queues</strong>. Queues are how you send a list of commands to the GPU, and they can be members of one or more <strong>queue families</strong>, each of which can do different things (e.g.&nbsp;draw the vertices of a 3D model).</p>
<p><strong>Command buffers</strong> are how you submit commands to a queue. Device commands are ‘recorded’ to a command buffer through Vulkan API calls, and can then be submitted once or many times (e.g.&nbsp;once every frame) to a queue to be executed.</p>
<p>That’s the TL;DR - now it’s time to dive into the details!</p>
<h2 id="genesis">Genesis</h2>
<p><strong><em>Instances and Devices</em></strong></p>
<p><em>In the beginning there was the Vulkan API. And the API was made flesh through <code>vk::Instance</code>, and from it sprung all per-application state.</em></p>
<p>You initialize Vulkan by creating an instance, which contains application state - information like what version of the Vulkan API you’re using, your application’s name, and which extensions and layers you want to enable. Extensions and layers provide behavior that isn’t included by default in Vulkan, like extended error checking and call logging.</p>
<p>With an instance you can examine the <strong>physical devices</strong> (usually GPUs) that are available. A machine might have multiple physical devices, and each of their properties (such as being a dedicated graphics card) can be inspected.</p>
<p>A common pattern for physical device selection is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>List all of the physical devices</li>
<li>Score each physical device on desired properties</li>
<li>Give physical devices without required properties a score of 0</li>
<li>Pick the physical device with the highest score</li>
</ul>

<p>Physical devices represent the GPU, and logical devices are what you use to create resources and access <strong>queues</strong>.</p>
<p>Keeping the logical device separate from the physical device is also useful because it allows you to have multiple logical devices, each with their state and resources, for a single physical device. One example of where this would be useful is if you had a Vulkan rendering application that also used a UI Toolkit (also running on Vulkan) that was completely separate. They’d each need their own logical devices to operate, but they’re both using the same physical device.</p>
<p>Logical device creation is also where you create queues.</p>
<h2 id="making-stuff-happen">Making Stuff Happen</h2>
<p><strong><em>Queues, Command Buffers, and Render Passes</em></strong></p>
<p>A queue is a list of commands that the GPU executes.</p>
<p>Each queue can only have certain types of commands (some can have multiple types, others just one), and this is specified when a queue is created.</p>
<p>The four types of queue operations are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Graphics</strong> —&gt; Drawing the vertices of a model</li>
<li><strong>Compute</strong> —&gt; Ray tracing, cloth simulation</li>
<li><strong>Transfer</strong> —&gt; Loading textures and buffers</li>
<li><strong>Sparse</strong> —&gt; Loading part of a ‘mega-texture’</li>
</ul>
<p>A physical device will give you access to several queues of different <strong>queue families</strong>, and when you create a queue it will be an index to a queue of a matching queue family on the device. Queue families are queues that have the same properties as one another (e.g.&nbsp;perform both graphics and compute operations).</p>
<p>Commands are submitted to queues by first recording a series of commands into a command buffer and then submitting the entire command buffer to a queue with <code>vk::Queue::submit()</code>.</p>
<p>Note: Ideally you should reuse command buffers, but generally you can re-record them every frame without a large performance hit, and it makes some things easier (e.g.&nbsp;sending uniform buffers to shaders).</p>
<p>Also, you can submit multiple command buffers to a single queue. One reason why this is useful is that it <em>can</em> allow you to ensure that one set of commands from a command buffer completes execution before another command buffer in the queue starts (more on this later).</p>
<p>Finally, commands recorded in command buffers can perform:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Actions</strong> —&gt; draw, dispatch, clear, copy, query operations etc</li>
<li><strong>State setting</strong> —&gt; bind pipelines / buffers, push constants etc</li>
<li><strong>Synchronization</strong> —&gt; set / wait events, pipeline barriers etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Some commands perform just one of these tasks, while others do several. A <strong>render pass</strong> is needed to execute certain commands, including drawing.</p>
<h3 id="render-passes">Render Passes</h3>
<p>A render pass consists of one or more <strong>subpasses</strong>, along with several <strong>framebuffers</strong>. Framebuffers represent a series of memory attachments (e.g.&nbsp;color, depth etc) that each subpass can read from and write to.</p>
<p>A command in a subpass might write to a color buffer, which will allow for later subpasses / render passes to read from it. This allows for techniques like deferred rendering.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://learnopengl.com/img/advanced-lighting/deferred_g_buffer.png" alt=""><figcaption>Color attachments after initial render pass in deferred rendering (LearnOpenGL)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Deferred rendering is a story for another day, but the gist of it is that you can store most of the geometry information in an initial render pass, and <em>defer</em> expensive rendering operations like lighting for later.</p>
<details>
<summary><b> Example code for recording to a command buffer and render pass </b></summary>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>// Create a command buffer</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a>vk::CommandBuffer cmd;</span>

<span id="cb2-6"><a href="#cb2-6"></a>cmd.beginRenderPass(vk::RenderPassBeginInfo());</span>
<span id="cb2-7"><a href="#cb2-7"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-8"><a href="#cb2-8"></a><span>// Bind a graphics pipeline (covered later)</span></span>
<span id="cb2-9"><a href="#cb2-9"></a>cmd.bindPipeline(vk::PipelineBindPoint::eGraphics, graphicsPipeline);</span>
<span id="cb2-10"><a href="#cb2-10"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-11"><a href="#cb2-11"></a><span>// Bind vertex buffers containing info needed to draw vertices</span></span>
<span id="cb2-12"><a href="#cb2-12"></a>cmd.bindVertexBuffers(<span>0</span>, <span>1</span>, vertexBuffers, offsets);</span>
<span id="cb2-13"><a href="#cb2-13"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-14"><a href="#cb2-14"></a><span>// Draw the buffer currently bound to this command buffer</span></span>
<span id="cb2-15"><a href="#cb2-15"></a>cmd.draw(vertices.size(), <span>1</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>0</span>);</span>
<span id="cb2-16"><a href="#cb2-16"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-17"><a href="#cb2-17"></a><span>// Stop recording to the render pass and command buffer</span></span>
<span id="cb2-18"><a href="#cb2-18"></a>cmd.endRenderPass();</span>
<span id="cb2-19"><a href="#cb2-19"></a>cmd.end();</span></code></pre></div>
</details>
<p>Last thing! Some commands that perform actions (e.g.&nbsp;draw vertices) do so based on the current state (e.g.&nbsp;the currently bound array of vertices) set by commands since the start of the command buffer. This means that in the above code example, <code>cmd.draw()</code> will operate on the current state set by <code>cmd.bindVertex()</code> in the previous line. This “synchronization guarantee”, that one command will finish executing before the next one starts, is usually not true.</p>
<h2 id="synchronization">Synchronization</h2>
<p>GPUs are optimized for operation throughput, and because of this (with a few exceptions) <strong><em>commands are not executed in the order they were recorded in.</em></strong> The first command that performs an action in a command buffer isn’t guaranteed to finish executing before the last action command in that buffer. The first command buffer submitted to a queue won’t necessarily finish any commands before a later command buffer starts. The same thing applies to command buffers submitted on different queues and multiple subpasses.</p>
<p>At places the Vulkan spec is confusing on this topic, but the TL;DR is that this is true unless a <strong>synchronization object</strong> is used (or with state setting commands within a single command buffer).</p>
<p>There are a few different types of synchronization objects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Fences</strong> (GPU to CPU sync) —&gt; EX: ensure there are only two rendered frames at a time in the swap chain (i.e.&nbsp;double buffering)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Semaphores</strong> (GPU to GPU sync across queues) —&gt; EX: wait for frame to finish rendering before presenting it</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Barriers</strong> (Sync within a command buffer / pipeline) –&gt; EX: start compute shader execution as soon as the vertex shader is finished</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Subpass Dependencies</strong> (Sync between subpasses) –&gt; EX: wait for the normal and albedo attachments to complete before starting the lighting rendering subpass.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Synchronization is closely tied to the <strong>graphics pipeline.</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-graphics-pipeline">The Graphics Pipeline</h2>

        <p>With the unveiling of iOS 14 following WWDC 2020, Apple has again updated its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml?changes=latest_minor">Core ML framework</a> with even richer interfaces for training, running, and fine-tuning machine learning models on users’ devices. Among these improvements, neural network models can now  support <a href="https://lukereichold.com/blog/posts/3d-mnist-swift-for-tensorflow/#3d-convolutional-networks">3D convolutional and pooling layers</a>, which are the backbone of many popular video classification models. Today, we’ll walk through <strong>how to take a pre-trained, off-the-shelf video classification model and get it running on iOS!</strong></p>
<p><em>For an incredibly thorough overview of the other new ML advances for Apple platforms introduced this year, I recommend Matthijs Hollemans’ article,  <a href="https://machinethink.net/blog/new-in-apple-machine-learning-2020/">Apple machine learning in 2020: What’s new?</a></em>.</p>
<p>Requirements: Xcode 12.0 beta or later</p>
<p>💡 <strong>Follow along with <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11Cr8w_T53bPLHPvLfZteAxHhtjgBS-LH#scrollTo=cJdRBFjQRYOJ"><strong>the completed Colab notebook</strong></a> and <a href="https://github.com/lukereichold/VisualActionKit/tree/0.1.0"><strong>Swift package on Github</strong></a>.</strong></p>
<h2 id="-fetching-the-pre-trained-model">⬇ Fetching the pre-trained model</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/deepmind/kinetics-i3d">Inflated 3D Convnet (or I3D)</a> is an architecture created by DeepMind researchers to perform human action classification for videos. We will use the I3D model that has been pre-trained on DeepMind’s <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/kinetics">Kinetics 400 dataset</a>. That is, given a tensor containing frames of a video, this model will output probabilities that the given video belongs to any one of 400 respective action classes (e.g. “air drumming”, “making tea”, “bench pressing”, etc).</p>
<p>As this is a TensorFlow model, our goal is to convert it to an <code>MLModel</code> that can be consumed natively on Apple platforms. To get started, we’ll open up <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11Cr8w_T53bPLHPvLfZteAxHhtjgBS-LH#scrollTo=gTW3l22wUdHD">a new Colab notebook</a> and import <a href="https://github.com/apple/coremltools"><code>coremltools</code></a>, Apple’s Python library for model conversion, editing, and validation.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>!</span>pip install coremltools<span>==</span><span>4.0</span>b1
<span>import</span> coremltools <span>as</span> ct
</code></pre></div><p>Next, we’ll fetch the <code>kinetics-i3d</code> repo and run the included sample evaluation script which loads the pre-rained RGB video classification model, performs an inference on a sample video (so we know that it’s working), and then exports the frozen TensorFlow model as <code>frozen_model.pb</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>!</span>git clone https:<span>/</span><span>/</span>github<span>.</span>com<span>/</span>lukereichold<span>/</span>kinetics<span>-</span>i3d
<span>%</span>cd kinetics<span>-</span>i3d<span>/</span>

<span>!</span>python evaluate_sample<span>.</span>py <span>-</span><span>-</span>eval_type rgb
</code></pre></div><p>Next, we’ll grab the class labels from the repo, where each of the 400 strings corresponds to a potential action in a video.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>with</span> open(<span></span><span>"</span><span>data/label_map.txt</span><span>"</span>) <span>as</span> f:
  class_labels <span>=</span> f<span>.</span>read()<span>.</span>splitlines()

  <span>assert</span> len(class_labels) <span>==</span> <span>400</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="-converting-the-frozen-model-to-core-ml">📲 Converting the frozen model to Core ML</h2>
<p>Finally, we’ll use the <code>coremltools</code> package to convert our frozen TensorFlow model to an <code>mlmodel</code> that can be directly consumed by iOS and macOS applications.</p>
<p>The model expects a tensor of shape <code>(1, NUM_FRAMES, 224, 224, 3)</code>, that is, an array of RGB frames, each of size 224 x 224 and – according to the <a href="https://github.com/deepmind/kinetics-i3d">model’s original specification</a> — pixel values rescaled to between -1 and 1.</p>
<p>We’d like to make the number of frames dynamic, so that our model works for any video containing between, say, 25 and 300 frames. Therefore, we create a <code>TensorType</code> with a flexible shape that will be passed into the converter.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">range_input <span>=</span> ct<span>.</span>TensorType(shape<span>=</span>(<span>1</span>, ct<span>.</span>RangeDim(lower_bound<span>=</span><span>25</span>, upper_bound<span>=</span><span>300</span>, default<span>=</span><span>250</span>), <span>224</span>, <span>224</span>, <span>3</span>))
</code></pre></div><p>Also, to make using our classifier model easier to consume, we tell the model about our explicit class labels so that these are explicitly visible within Xcode.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">config <span>=</span> ct<span>.</span>ClassifierConfig(class_labels)

<span># This is where the magic happens:</span>
mlmodel <span>=</span> ct<span>.</span>convert(<span></span><span>"</span><span>kinetics-i3d/frozen_model.pb</span><span>"</span>, source<span>=</span><span></span><span>'</span><span>tensorflow</span><span>'</span>, classifier_config<span>=</span>config, inputs<span>=</span>[range_input])
</code></pre></div><p>We can also choose to add additional metadata to our model:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span># Optionally, add metadata to be visible in Xcode.</span>
mlmodel<span>.</span>license <span>=</span> <span></span><span>"</span><span>Apache-2.0 License</span><span>"</span>
mlmodel<span>.</span>author <span>=</span> <span></span><span>"</span><span>Google Inc.</span><span>"</span>

mlmodel<span>.</span>short_description <span>=</span> <span></span><span>"</span><span>Convolutional neural network performing human action recognition on video data, trained on the Kinetics 400 dataset.</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>🎉 With the conversion successfully performed, we’ll save our new <code>mlmodel</code> to disk! It’s now ready to be imported into an Xcode project.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">mlmodel<span>.</span>save(<span></span><span>'</span><span>kinetics_i3d.mlmodel</span><span>'</span>)
</code></pre></div><figure>
    <img src="https://lukereichold.com/blog/Kinetics_Xcode_MLModel.png">

<h2 id="-consuming-the-model-with-visualactionkit">📦 Consuming the model with VisualActionKit</h2>
<p>As of Swift 5.3, we’re now able to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/bundling_resources_with_a_swift_package">bundle resources with a Swift package</a>, so <a href="https://github.com/lukereichold/VisualActionKit"><code>VisualActionKit</code></a> was created to leverage this new functionality by effectively acting as a convenience wrapper around our <code>kinetics_i3d.mlmodel</code>. It offers the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accepts an <code>AVAsset</code> as input</li>
<li>Pre-processes the asset’s data into a format the model expects, including resizing each frame of the video to 224 x 224 pixels using the <a href="https://github.com/deepmind/kinetics-i3d">custom resizing strategy outlined in original I3D model repo</a>.</li>
<li>Builds an <code>MLMultiArray</code> tensor containing the asset data</li>
<li>Feeds the input tensor into our model and asynchronously returns the resulting predictions.</li>
</ul>
<p>To install this package for use in our own apps, we add the following to our app’s <code>Package.swift</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="swift"><span>let</span> package = Package(
    ...
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: <span>"</span><span>https://github.com/lukereichold/VisualActionKit.git</span><span>"</span>, from: <span>"</span><span>0.1.0</span><span>"</span>)
    ],
    ...
)
</code></pre></div><p>Now, we can perform action classifications on any provided videos, regardless of the source or input format! Here’s some example usage:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="swift"><span>import</span> <span>VisualActionKit</span>

<span>let</span> url = Bundle.module.url(forResource: <span>"</span><span>writing</span><span>"</span>, withExtension: <span>"</span><span>mp4</span><span>"</span>)
<span>let</span> asset = AVAsset(url: url)

<span>try</span> Classifier.shared.classify(asset) { predictions <span>in</span>
    print(predictions)
    <span>//</span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>l</span><span>a</span><span>s</span><span>s</span><span>L</span><span>a</span><span>b</span><span>e</span><span>l</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>w</span><span>r</span><span>i</span><span>t</span><span>i</span><span>n</span><span>g</span><span>"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>p</span><span>r</span><span>o</span><span>b</span><span>a</span><span>b</span><span>i</span><span>l</span><span>i</span><span>t</span><span>y</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>.</span><span>9</span><span>9</span><span>7</span><span>8</span><span>8</span><span>1</span><span>2</span><span>3</span><span>3</span><span>6</span><span>9</span><span>2</span><span>1</span><span>6</span><span>9</span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>And that’s it!</p>
<p><strong>Outside of this specific action classification model, we can use these same steps to convert any arbitrary pre-trained model</strong> to run on Apple platforms by using <code>coremltools v4</code>.</p>
<p>Additionally, different than what we did here, if we were interested in <em>training our own action classifier from scratch</em> – without touching any Python or model conversion code – we also have ability to do so now. For more info, I recommend checking out the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10043/">2020 WWDC session covering Create ML</a>. Until next time!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>The four noble truths in Buddhism forms the core of the Buddha’s teachings. These are explained in the very first sermon delivered by Buddha, known as&nbsp;<em>dhammacakkappavattana sutta</em>, which in English loosely translates to, “Settings the wheel of dhamma or the truth in motion.”</p> <p>Understanding <strong>the four noble truths</strong> is a vast subject that needs a detailed and thorough explanation, and it’s impossible to cover it in a single blog post. However, the information I present here will serve as an introductory text for those who wish to understand Buddha’s teachings.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-box-3"></span></p><p>What differentiates Buddha’s teachings from others is that he mentions that his teachings should be understood through direct experience rather than simply believing what he says.</p><p>The experiences that he talks about can be verified through different mindfulness practices and meditations. These find mention in the texts (<em>suttas</em>) and practiced by a lot of people all across the world.</p><p>Four noble truths form the foundation of a deep-rooted philosophy that can be applied to daily practical life. The primary focus of his teachings is on the&nbsp;<em>here and now</em>. Although these teaching were delivered sometime around 500 BCE, they have stood the test of time and are still applicable today.</p><p>At first glance, you may find Buddhism to be very pessimistic, as it starts with the concept of dukkha or suffering. Dukkha is a word of the Pali language, which is a combination of two words:&nbsp;<em>du</em>&nbsp;means “hard,” and&nbsp;<em>kkha</em>&nbsp;means “to endure.”</p><p>Translation of dukkha in English, referred to as the suffering, is a gross oversimplification of the term. Unfortunately, there is no direct equivalent in the English language. It has a much deeper meaning, which we shall explore next.</p><h2><span id="The_First_Noble_Truth_There_is_Suffering_or_Dukkha"></span>The First Noble Truth: There is Suffering or Dukkha<span></span></h2><p>The word dukkha is much more subtle than the English word suffering. It constitutes injury, sickness, old age, mental pain, death, sorrow, grief, anguish, and more. It further includes minor frustrations such as disappointments, dissatisfactions, and irritations encountered in daily life.</p><p>It also includes even the most subtle sources of stress like:</p><ul><li>Having to work for longer hours than usual occasionally.</li><li>Not being appropriately apricated for the efforts put into a piece of work.</li><li>Not being correctly greeted by a friend or a colleague at work.</li><li>Having to give more than you receive in a relationship.</li><li>Being rudely spoken to in a demeaning tone.</li><li>Being made fun of in a covert manner.</li><li>Getting irritated standing and waiting in a queue for a cup of coffee.</li><li>Frustration when the server at the coffee shop hands you a latte instead of the cappuccino you asked.</li></ul><p>I can go on and on, but you get the idea. All of this is dukkha. Now you may argue that this is just a normal part of daily living. How can you call it dukkha or suffering? It happens to all of us, and it’s normal, right?</p><p>You may argue that the real dukkha is passing away of a loved one, or losing a job overnight, or losing all of your income because of the collapse of the economy, or getting a divorce. These are more pressing matters. And yes! You’re right. All of the above are dukkha.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p><p>But here’s what most people don’t understand. The minor frustrations and dissatisfaction that we encounter in our daily lives have a cumulative adverse effect on our psyche. It grows very slowly in a subtle manner.</p><p>While the death of a loved one hurts a lot initially, the wounds heal with time. The created void may never go, but eventually, much of it is filled up with time. However, the subtle injuries caused to our psyche go undetected in many of the cases.</p><p>Over time, these frustrations get accumulated to such an extent that one resorts to ending one’s life to escape the pain. The problem is that we have normalized ailments like stress, anxiety, and depression, as a part of daily life.</p><p>For example, you might argue that losing a job is much worse than being rudely spoken too. Now, this would depend on your personality.</p><p>But in general, I have observed that people soon forget about the hardships they face during the times of unemployment. But even after years, they still remember the incident where they were ill-treated or rudely spoken too.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-box-4"></span></p><p>Once you get a new job, you forget about the pain of losing your old job. But the incidents of offensive and demeaning behaviors go directly into your subconscious.</p><p>These get accumulated over time and create great mental suffering, and sometimes even manifest as a disease in the physical body.</p><p>Again, you may argue that one cannot escape these unpleasantries of life. And yes! You are right again. But the question is – How much do you intend to suffer these unpleasantries? What we call as ups and downs of life are merely just events. There’s nothing good or bad about them.</p><p>Yet we suffer! And still, continue to suffer.</p><p>Buddha explains that there are three kinds of dukkhas:</p><ol><li>The first is simple to understand suffering, like sickness, injury, old age, death, grief, despair, sorrow, etc. It includes both physical and mental pain. We have already covered this kind of suffering above.</li><li>There is a second kind of suffering that is caused by change. Everything is subject to change and finally comes to an end. There is no such thing as a permanency. However, the mind craves for permanency, and therefore, the suffering arises. For example, expecting secure attachments in relationships, friendships, work, etc.,  results in unhappiness.</li><li>Finally, the third kind of suffering buddha talks about is suffering due to the conditioned states. The word used for this suffering is “<em>Sankara.”</em>&nbsp;Unfortunately, there is no parallel English word that can describe it. There are five conditioned states, also known as the five aggregates, or&nbsp;<em>skandhas</em>, where one is physical, and the other four are mental.</li></ol><p>Now here’s something to think. If you notice carefully, there’s a contradiction between the statement of the first noble truth and the fourth noble truth.</p><p>The first noble truth says that all in this world is suffering, while the fourth noble truth says that there is a way out of it. How can both of these statements be true?</p><p>You see, the statement of the first noble truth is not an absolute, because the dukkha is born out of ignorance or&nbsp;<em>avidya</em>. Hence, one perceives this world as dukkha. The understanding of the fourth noble truth enables us to experience the world as it is.</p><p>Now that we know what dukkha is let’s get to the next section: the origin of suffering.</p><h2><span id="The_Second_Noble_Truth_%E2%80%93_The_Origin_of_Suffering"></span>The Second Noble Truth – The Origin of Suffering<span></span></h2><p>The origin of suffering is attachment (or L<em>obha</em>) to three kinds of cravings, also known as Tanha (or Trishna in Sanskrit).</p><h3><span id="The_Kama_Tanha_Craving_for_Sensory_Pleasures"></span>The Kama Tanha: Craving for Sensory Pleasures<span></span></h3><p>This kind of craving or thirst comes with the attachment to sensory pleasures. We always seek things that excite our senses. For example, we get exciting seeing a nice car, and a strong desire to acquire it arises from within. In Buddhism, this is the beginning of dukkha.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-large-leaderboard-2"></span></p><p>Anything that satisfies the craving of the five senses: vision, smell, hearing, taste, and touch – is Kama Tanha. The main reason behind this is that these cravings only give temporary satisfaction.</p><p>The moment you set your attention to sensory pleasure objects, that very moment marks the beginning of suffering. The problem with this kind of craving is that it is insatiable. The more you have, the more you want.</p><p>Another example would be eating your favorite food or dessert. Even after you’ve finished eating, you crave more. For some, this craving comes back after a day or two, while for others, it comes back instantly.</p><p>However, the past conditioning of the mind is so intense that we do not see anything wrong with it. A few minutes of compulsive behavior now and then, generally speaking, creates long term health consequences.</p><h3><span id="The_Bhava_Tanha_Sense_of_Wanting_To_Become_Something"></span>The Bhava Tanha: Sense of Wanting To Become Something<span></span></h3><p>Bhava Tanha is the desire to achieve permanence in some way. One example would be the desire to continue in the heavenly realms as consciousness after death. In this case, the attachment to life and existence is so high that the very thought of not existing after death scares people.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-leader-1"></span></p><p>Similarly, becoming a monk with the desire to attain enlightenment is also Bhava Tanha. Practicing meditation, chanting, reciting mantras, performing rituals in the desire to achieve the&nbsp;<em>nirvana</em>&nbsp;(the freedom from the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth) is again Bhava Tanha.</p><p>It is easy to misunderstand this Tanha. For example, when I started my spiritual practice a couple of years ago, I found myself falling into this trap.</p><p>As I read more into the philosophical aspects of these scriptures, I was so impressed that I immediately started giving sermons to the people around me, even when they didn’t ask for it.</p><p>I had built such strong identifications with these philosophical ideas that I used to get upset when people showed disinterest.</p><p>But my thirst for being the “most knowledgeable” and “all-knowing” had blinded me. I was always keeping a check on how other people perceived me. And I didn’t like it when people disagreed with my ideas.</p><p>What I realized was that I had fallen into the same worldly trap once again. I was indirectly seeking recognition as a spiritual teacher. The desire to be known as the great teacher was deluding me. This desire for being recognized and praised is also Bhava Tanha.</p><h3><span id="The_Vibhava_Tanha_Desire_To_Get_Rid_of_Things"></span>The Vibhava Tanha: Desire To Get Rid of Things<span></span></h3><p>There is another type of Tanha that is the exact opposite of Bhava Tanha. It is known as Vibhava Tanha, that is the desire to get rid of things.</p><p>This craving generally happens when we fail in our endeavors, such as building a profitable business or attaining spiritual enlightenment. We quickly get disillusioned by the present circumstances and become opposed to it, believing it to be the root cause of our suffering.</p><p>Therefore, we create a desire to get rid of things that leads to unhappiness. For example, it is seen that people who get disillusioned with money and fame turn towards spirituality in search of solace. The problem is that they create another desire to seek peace in …</p></div></div>

<h2><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadavlev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nadav Lev</a> is far from your average VP of R&amp;D</strong></h2>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><em>Nadav, pictured left, with his dev team celebrating an FC Barcelona win in Barcelona on the Axonius company retreat.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>His first “job” writing code was in the elite Israeli military intelligence agency <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_8200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unit 8200</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similar in function to the United States NSA, 8200 has been called&nbsp; “the foremost technical intelligence agency in the world.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every Israeli serves in the military after high school. Only a select few get into 8200.</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>I’ve been working with Nadav for about 15 months. I knew right away he was different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His brain moves fast and his speech is efficient – even when speaking with me in English which is his second language. He’s tough like you would expect from a military man. But also warm. After his team had been using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://linearb.io/" target="_blank">LinearB</a> for a few months, he would ask me <em>“do you want this feedback the Israeli way or the American way?”</em> I’m pretty sure he reserves the “Israeli way” for people he trusts so I chose to take it as a compliment 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p>His approach to building elite dev teams is different too. He’s not afraid to run his own playbook.</p>







<h3><strong>“Elite” software development team defined&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Before we get into Nadav’s leadership and team building secrets, it helps to understand how he thinks about elite teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Nadav’s top 6 not-so-obvious characteristics of an elite dev team:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li>The team exhausts themselves to find the best solution to problems, not just any solution</li><li>“Automation-first” is built into the culture and day-to-day decision making of everything</li><li>Important ideas and steps get documented with a high level of quality and reverence&nbsp;</li><li>Discussions are mostly about the future, sometimes about the present, and rarely about past&nbsp;</li><li>When mistakes are made the first instinct is to create new process (not accuse)&nbsp;</li><li>They <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://linearb.io/blog/how-to-introduce-data-driven-culture-to-your-dev-team/" target="_blank">align engineering metrics to business goals</a>&nbsp;</li></ul>



<figure><blockquote><p>His #1 characteristic of a great team: <strong>They make other teams around them better.&nbsp;</strong></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Nadav played basketball growing up. He talks about great dev teams the way basketball analysts describe great point guards. <em>“Their play and their leadership make everyone around them better.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><em>Steph, Kemba, and Dame are three of the best.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>“It’s also important to look at the elite team through the eyes of the developer.”</em> Nadav said. <em>“Not everyone knows how it feels.” </em>Nadav pointed out some not-so-obvious things that feel differently about being a member of an elite dev team:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>You can be yourself and admit your mistakes freely without fear&nbsp;</li><li>It feels like everyone on the team is smarter than you – in a good way</li><li>Teammates behave the same to each other when the manager is not around</li><li>Teammates are regularly solving problems for you before you know you have one</li><li>Every time CI is not perfectly green, by the time you notice, someone is already fixing it</li></ul>







<h3><strong>Journey from top secret to top start-up</strong></h3>



<figure><p><strong>ALERT: </strong>Nadav’s story and secrets outline an actionable playbook for the following audiences:&nbsp;<br><strong>➜</strong> Developers looking for the path to get <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://linearb.io/blog/promoted-from-dev-to-team-lead-8-things-they-didnt-tell-me/" target="_blank">promoted to team lead</a><br><strong>➜</strong> Engineering leaders getting ready to scale up their existing team<br><strong>➜</strong> Engineering leaders coming in to build a new team from scratch<br><strong>➜</strong> Dev teams looking to advance from good to great</p></figure>



<p>Today, Nadav is Vice President of Research &amp; Development for the hot security start-up <a href="https://www.axonius.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Axonius</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was curious about his journey to get there so I asked him about his first project in 8200. He gave me a wry smile and said <em>“<strong>classified</strong>.”</em> It involved writing code and he was by himself. That’s all he could tell me without killing me 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>It must have gone well because after that first project he got to choose what he wanted to work on next and they assigned a second person to help him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It continued like that for a while. He kept impressing his bosses with cool, top secret tech. They kept assigning more people to help him on his next project.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“I started almost every team I was on but was never the formal leader. I got offers to be a team lead but I refused. <strong>I was having too much fun doing cool, hands-on shit</strong>.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Why did he keep moving from project to project? If the project went well, why not stay on to maintain it? <em>“<strong>Builders gotta build</strong>.<strong>”</strong></em>  Yes. They surely do 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nadav stayed with his unit for 6 years – double the required term of 3 years. During that time he met <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deansysman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dean Sysman</a>. Later, when Dean was CTO of a security start-up called Cymmetria, he recruited him to join.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“The final project I started in the army eventually had 50 people working on it. I felt great about what I accomplished and I was ready for a different challenge.”</em> It was time to build something new. He joined Cymmetria as senior developer.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Early on, I figured out that while we have awesome technologists, probably among the brightest in the world, <strong>no one knew how to manage development, release, and write good code. So I took charge</strong>.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sound familiar? This time when Nadav was offered the role of team lead he took it. <em>“The change was minimal. I was already documenting all of our sprint processes, leading our ceremonies, our testing approach… doing it de facto.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I asked if he liked being a lead, his eyes lit up and he got closer to the camera.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>He liked it. They raised series A funding and he scaled the dev team from 2 to 10. After three years they had built every feature on their wish list and the company was succeeding. Nadav wanted a new project and decided it was time to move on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eventually, he got in touch with Dean Sysman again who was now CEO of a new security start-up called Axonius. Dean didn’t want Nadav to be a dev or team lead. He wanted him to be his VP of R&amp;D.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Things moved even faster this time. In the 24 months after Nadav joined, Axonius exploded:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>The number of people in Axonius grew by 5X</li><li>Nadav scaled the number of people in R&amp;D by 5X</li><li>They won the <a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/about/press-releases/axonius-named-most-innovative-startup-at-2019-rsa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coveted RSAC most innovative start-up award</a></li><li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/axonius-nabs-58m-for-its-cybersecurity-focused-network-asset-management-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">They raised a whopping $95 million dollars</a> from top-tier investors&nbsp;</li></ul>







<h2><strong>7 secrets from 8200 for building elite dev teams</strong></h2>



<p>Naturally, after hearing this impressive story, I asked Nadav what he learned on the journey. Many of his fundamental beliefs for building and scaling teams trace back to his days in 8200.</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>**Name Redacted**, Captain Nadav Lev, and **Name Redacted**</figcaption></figure>







<h3><strong>Secret #1: Learn to lead without a mandate or official title&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Leading people without title or authority…&nbsp; Easy to say. Incredibly hard to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“I had to learn to get developers to do what I think was right without formal authority over them.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>So how exactly does he do it?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Nadav explains indirect leadership and how it can help you build teams and get promoted.</em></strong></p>



<iframe width="560" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HjI5uUuV6Qw?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>







<h3><strong>Secret #2: “If you can’t stand the heat then don’t get into the kitchen.”&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Part of leading, especially when you don’t have the title, is putting in the work. <em>“Initially, at Cymmetria, I was doing my job plus creating process documents, writing training guides, building automation, helping everyone… It worked for me in the army so I did it again.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Isn’t that a lot of hours? I asked.<strong> </strong><em>“If you can’t stand the heat then don’t get into the kitchen.”</em></p>



<p>Ladies and gentlemen, that was Nadav giving it to me the “Israeli way” 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Nadav shares the truth about how much time indirect leadership takes.</em></strong></p>



<iframe width="560" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NaJcEtRYdVI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>







<h3><strong>Secret #3: The smarter the person, the more “why” matters&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>According to Nadav <em>“It’s easier to influence average employees. They’re more likely to follow your requests on face value. Your best people are actually harder to manage because they will push back if they don’t understand why you’re asking them to do something.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Nadav explains how to manage highly intelligent people using “why”</em></strong></p>



<iframe width="560" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yH9OBaGysZ4?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>







<h3><strong>Secret #4: Become great at every job yourself before you hire anyone&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p><em>“I had a boss in the army tell me ‘if you want to be the best leader you can be, you must know the job of every person you work with, better than that person.”</em></p>



<p><em>“I was furious with this because it contradicted every leadership idea I knew of.”</em> I get it. I can think of about eight Harvard Business Review articles I’ve read that might disagree.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But over time Nadav saw the merit in this approach. Remember, your best employees will push back until they know why 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nadav explains <em>“In order to work with people effectively you have to understand them completely. In order to understand them, you have to understand their job. What are their difficulties? What are they trying to achieve? How are they being measured? How do they perceive you? If you walk a mile in their shoes, you will find that understanding them becomes much easier.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Now I understand. It’s not about control. It’s about empathy. It also doesn’t mean you have to DO every job better than the people that work for you. You just have to KNOW every job better. Like a coach of a basketball team. They understand what great looks like even if they never played at a high level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Nadav started at Axonius, he took this idea to the extreme, and started his tenure there in the most contrarian way I can imagine.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“My plan was to spend my first few weeks meeting everyone, learning, getting comfortable with the people. However, I realized that if I do that, I won’t have the time then to build all the processes and infrastructure we need. So I discarded my initial plan and put my heart and soul into personally building everything our team needed to succeed.”</em> </p>



<p>In two weeks he:</p>



<ul><li>Wrote 200 pages of code for an end-to-end, automated product testing mechanism</li><li>Integrated coding standard enforcement tools for consistency and shorter reviews.&nbsp;</li><li>Remodeled the Confluence knowledge base to make it easier to find stuff.&nbsp;</li><li>Wrote a guide instructing how to set up a new environment.&nbsp;</li><li>Configured Jira for maximum ease and transparency.&nbsp;</li><li>Wrote a 20 page training program from scratch.</li></ul>







<p>He literally told the CEO <em>“I’m going to start but please don’t put me in charge of the team yet.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is that crazy or genius? Nadav argues it was the best thing he could have done.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>

	<p>It's worth discussing <em>how</em> all this works so you understand the 
	challenges that are being overcome here. The ability to run multiple DOS 
	programs at once is a pretty neat trick, given that this software heralds 
	from an era of computing that was <em>just barely</em> ahead of what the 
	Apple ][ was doing in 1978. If you want to skip this, <a href="#Windows_1.0">go ahead</a>.</p>
	<p>The root of the problem is that the IBM PCs basic architecture 
	crystallized a very long time ago, in 1981. In a world where ten kilobytes of RAM counted for 
	about what a gig does now, there was not a lot of room for "overhead" and 
	the idea that you would run two programs simultaneously was generally 
	unrealistic except at the high end of the computing world, which most PC 
	buyers were nowhere near. You needed every bit (<em>ha</em>) of memory you could get, and when 
	memory became more affordable a few years later, it was too late 
	to change anything.</p>
	<p>After just a couple years on the market, MS-DOS had become the 
	unquestioned OS of choice for the PC<a href="#footnote1">*</a> 
	and developed a monumental stable of software, every bit of which<em> </em>
	was essential to someone, somewhere, and could not be easily replaced. Thus 
	began one of the longest tails in technology history, as the PC industry and 
	Microsoft began contorting themselves to try not to 
	break compatibility with old software while still moving forward with advanced 
	functionality.<br>
	<sub><a name="footnote1">*</a>(specifically, since there were MS-DOSes for 
	other architectures, and other OSes for the PC)</sub></p>
	<p>Because DOS was developed under constraints very similar to those 
	in the 
	late '70s that gave us the "bitty boxes" (C64, Apple ][, ZX 
	Spectrum, etc.) it was not built with any kind of "supervision" in mind. In 
	other words, there was no abstraction level above the current running program. 
	DOS was more like a set of tools than what we think 
	of as an operating system now - specifically, it had no "process management"; no concept of "processes" at all, in fact.</p>
	<h2><strong>DOS</strong></h2>
	<p>When the machine booted, the part of DOS that was considered "the OS" - 
	the code for accessing disk drives, writing text to screen, etc. - was copied 
	into memory, and then execution was handed off to the command interpreter, COMMAND.COM, 
	which was an application like any other, at which point you could begin 
	entering commands to use the computer.</p>
		<p>At this point, DOS was no longer "running" in 
	any meaningful way. The code was "resident," meaning it was present in the 
		computer's memory, but 
	the processor wasn't&nbsp; executing any of it. Instead, the CPU was busy executing 
	whatever the current program was - if you were at the command prompt, then 
		all the code the PC was executing was part of COMMAND.COM. When you launched another application, COMMAND.COM was 
	vacated and replaced by that other application.</p>
	<p>In other words, while an application was running, DOS was almost totally out of 
	the picture. The only time execution returned to DOS itself was when the 
	application requested a "service" from DOS, like accessing a disk drive, at 
	which point it would tell the CPU to go execute one of DOS' stored routines 
	for this, and when that routine was done, control would return to the 
	application. This meant that,<em> generally speaking</em>,<em> </em>the current 
	program 
	had absolute control of the PCs execution and it's memory. It could in fact choose to 
	overwrite DOS itself, obliterating it out of memory, and DOS couldn't do a damn thing about it.</p>
	<p>The currently running app also had the option to speak directly to hardware. 
	The 
	whole purpose of DOS was to abstract things like that so programs wouldn't 
	need to know the details of the system they were running on, but since the 
	IBM PC was <em>extremely</em> consistent hardware-wise in its early 
	incarnations, it was entirely 
	optional for developers to take advantage of that, and often 
	there were reasons - of performance, perhaps - to bypass DOS and do things 
	directly.</p>
		<p>DOS provided disk access routines, 
	but the app could blow right by them and shoot commands straight to the 
	floppy drive if it wanted. DOS provided routines for printing text and clearing the 
	screen, but the app could just write directly to video memory. I can't speak to how common this kind of behavior actually was, but it 
	certainly wasn't rare, and it speaks to a larger problem - DOS apps simply 
	expect total control over the system.</p>
		<p>If you run two DOS apps at once, they're 
	going to stomp on each other, because each one thinks it's in charge of the 
		whole machine. The first one would store data in the same spot that the 
		second one stored program code, and thus one would overwrite the other 
		and crash it. So DOS was a single-tasking operating system - you could 
		run one program at a time, and when you wanted to run another, you had 
		to exit, return to the command prompt, and then launch your other app.</p>
		<p>Consequently, if you were working on something 
	in Microsoft Multiplan and wanted to go look up some data in dBase, you had to quit completely 
	out of Multiplan and then start dBase, which would take over the system and totally 
	overwrite the previous app. To get back to where you were you'd have to exit 
		dBase, restart Multiplan, load your document and find your place again - 
		in the process, totally forgetting what you were there to do in the 
		first place, because it's so many steps and takes so long.</p>
	<p>Right from the get-go, PC users wanted to be able to look at one program, then rapidly 
	switch to another. On its face this seems to mean "run two programs at once," 
	which is what we do now, but that's not quite the full story. Let's touch on how 
	that works nowadays, however.</p>
	<h2><strong>Multiprocessing</strong></h2>
	<p>To be clear, you <em>cannot</em> run two programs "at once" on a 
	computer. Some would call this semantics, but it's important in a very real 
	way, <em>especially</em> when talking about 80s-era PCs.</p>
		<p>Modern multicore CPUs get very close to true parallel processing by 
		letting separate programs run on separate cores, but of course, nobody has a CPU so big 
	that they have one core per process. And even if you did, programs still 
		have to share other 
	resources - the system bus, hard drives, and so on. Access to these 
	resources has to be carefully managed so that only one application can use 
		them at a time, and each one has to be cleaned up after before another 
		one can use the same resources. Otherwise, one program could leave the 
		hardware in a state where the commands that the next program sends put 
		it in an unusable state and crash the machine, or corrupt data.</p>
	<p>Even with all our modern pipelined cleverness, you have the 
	fundamental problem that a CPU, and a computer in general, has a limited 
	amount of physical hardware and can't dedicate some to each individual 
	program that's running. When you have more processes running than you have silicon, the only option left is to share 
	resources by dividing up the amount of time that each process gets to use the hardware 
	- this is one of the oldest concepts in computing, and goes back to the late '50s.</p>
	<p>The fundamentals of this process are simple: At 
	any given moment, one program has near-total control of the entire 
	system, to execute its code and use all the resources, and then after it 
	executes for a bit, it goes into a paused state and control is handed off to 
	the next program, which does its work and then hands off to the next. This 
	continues in a round-robin fashion, so that every program gets to use the 
	hardware for a certain portion of every second.</p>
	<p>Modern implementations take this to a fever pitch with all the complex 
	machinations used to make this process efficient, but the fundamentals have 
	never changed; this is how your PC is operating right now.</p>
	<p>One big hurdle to overcome in implementing this is that programs don't just execute 
	instructions in a vacuum. As code is executed, there are side 
	effects. Some are values internal to the CPU, like the&nbsp; status of CPU registers and the current 
	position of the instruction pointer. This is called "CPU state," amd is specific to 
	each running program. When you switch from one program to another, you have to 
	save that information - called "context switching" - and restore it when you 
	come back. Storing this info takes extra time and memory.</p>
		<p>Another hurdle is the state of other hardware. If two programs are 
		talking to the hard drive, you can't let them both just blindly issue 
		commands every time they get control of the CPU. The first process might 
		start a data read that the second process interrupts with a data write, 
		confusing the hard drive controller. So when switching from one process 
		to another, you also have to save the state of these other hardware 
		resources - and possibly even delay switching tasks until those hardware 
		requests are complete.</p>
	<p>If you have enough RAM to store this state, and if your apps don't need too many cycles per second to appear responsive, you can do all this and the user 
	will feel like they're "running multiple programs at 
	once."</p>
	<p>Now, in business applications - the 
	driving force behind the first couple decades of computing - actual 
	"multiprocessing" of this type is not as important as simple usability - users 
	just don't want to have to close one program in order to open another, as they 
	did throughout the DOS days. That, ultimately, is the goal: it 
	doesn't matter if the computer is perfectly speedy, or if programs can run 
	simultaneously, it just matters that 
	users not have to lose all their work in one program simply in order to look 
	at another.</p>
	<h2>Multitasking</h2>
	<p>This desire was of course tremendous right from the start of computing. Who wants to 
	be stuck in one program at a time? So, almost from the 
	earliest days of the IBM PC, software was created to enable task switching 
	with various degrees of success.</p>

When programming for full operating
systems, like any desktop, mobile, or higher-end embedded platforms, the answer is easy—threads.
They're built into the OS, and you typically <em>have</em> to use them to take advantage of features like
multiple CPU cores. Or, when programming for an embedded target, you may reach for a lightweight
<abbr title="Real-Time Operating System">RTOS</abbr> like <a href="https://freertos.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">FreeRTOS</a>, which gives you full threads without much work.</p>
<p>But what if you have a 16MHz microcontroller with 2 KB of RAM?</p>
<p>The Arduino Uno is known for being ubiquitous, cheap, and easy to program. Although there are more
and more reasons to use competing products, such as the various ARM Cortex-M and Espressif boards
(which I use almost exclusively), the Microchip (formerly Atmel) ATMega series is sometimes still
preferred for low power applications, cutting cents off a <abbr title="Bill of Materials">BOM</abbr>, and its widespread support.</p>
<p>Typically, one checks in a loop repeatedly to see if the task is ready to activate. This can be
checking if there's data in a serial buffer, if a certain time period has passed, or a <abbr title="General-Purpose Input/Output">GPIO</abbr> pin has
toggled. However, I'm going to present an alternative to doing this—<code>async</code>/<code>await</code>.</p>

<p>Many modern languages are implementing <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>. C# was one of the first big languages to do
it, and then Python, JavaScript, Dart, Kotlin quickly followed. The big difference between threads
and <code>async</code> functions is that <code>async</code>hronous code is handled by the program itself, usually
cooperatively, while synchronous operations on threads rely on the OS to do it. The first obvious
reason for it, then, is when threads aren't available—just like what we're about to get into soon.
However, asynchronous code is typically faster than synchronous code because it is able to avoid the
overhead of spawning threads and context switches, as well as the memory overhead, as the amount of
space needed on the stack can be calculated ahead of time.</p>
<p>Internally, the compiler turns the code into a state machine, typically using the language's
generators feature if it has one. Here, every time you write <code>.await</code> and the data is not available
immediately, the compiler inserts a <code>return</code> statement, and adds a parameter that allows you to jump
right back to where it was. Rust uses <code>Pin</code>ning, where it is guaranteed that the generated struct
that holds the stack will always be in the same place in memory at all times. This avoids a problem
where a pointer is taken to a local variable, the function returns and comes back, and is suddenly
pointing to something completely different.</p>

<p>C++20 has similar features to Rust's <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> with the <code>co_await</code> keyword, although the
<a href="https://blog.panicsoftware.com/co_awaiting-coroutines/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">available documentation</a> is <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/02_execution/04_executor.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">not quite as good as Rust's</a>.
However, there's a total of... <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/search?q=%22co_await%22&amp;tab=forum" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">1 search result</a> on the Arduino forums, <em>and</em> it's
in German with no code. And even if there <em>was</em> code, it would be largely unaccessable as Arduino
ships with an old compiler:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>❱ ~/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avr-gcc/*/bin/avr-gcc --version
avr-gcc <span>(</span>GCC<span>)</span> <span>7.3</span>.0
Copyright <span>(</span>C<span>)</span> <span>2017</span> Free Software Foundation, Inc.</code></pre></div>
<p>GCC 7.3.0 ships with <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html#cxx17" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">"almost full support"</a> for C++17 (although not by default), but a
total of 0 C++20 additions. And if you're on PlatformIO, you'll have even less luck:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>❱ ~/.platformio/packages/toolchain-atmelavr/bin/avr-gcc --version
avr-gcc <span>(</span>AVR_8_bit_GNU_Toolchain_3.6.2_1759<span>)</span> <span>5.4</span>.0
Copyright <span>(</span>C<span>)</span> <span>2015</span> Free Software Foundation, Inc.</code></pre></div>
<p>However, Rust has been able to compile <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> code for <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/11/07/Async-await-stable.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">almost a year now on the <em>stable
compiler build</em></a>. There's been steadily increasing interest in using these
features on embedded platforms with Rust, and many projects have been using it as a result.</p>
<h2 id="pseudo-asyncawait">Pseudo-<code>async</code>/<code>await</code></h2>
<p>These libraries actually implement a <em>very</em> similar thing to <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> with a state machine,
and jumping to different positions in code based on where it's already been. For example,
<a href="https://github.com/bxparks/AceRoutine" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AceRoutine</a> has a macro, <code>COROUTINE</code>, that internally converts the function into a state machine
that jumps to different places using <code>goto</code>. This is actually almost identical to how tools like
Babel in the JavaScript world convert <code>async</code> functions to traditional functions that can be used
with old browsers.</p>
<p>However, there are a few very critical problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local variables are not preserved across yields</strong>.</li>
<li>You can't use certain statements in some libraries (not AceRoutine), such as <code>switch</code>.</li>
<li>Destructors don't run properly, and will <strong><code>free</code> uninitialized memory</strong> if not done correctly
(due to the first point).</li>
<li>Tasks can't return values.</li>
</ul>
<p>These limitations are because simple preprocessor macros, which is the only option in C/C++, are
only "glorified copy-paste", and have no real computing power. Although <code>async</code> is built into the
Rust compiler, it wasn't before, and a (less-than-ideal, but still usable) macro could implement
most of the feature itself. Hopefully, new C++20 features will lead to more use in the embedded
world.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>It looks like there's a few packages (known as "crates" in the Rust world) to interface with the
hardware:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/avr-rust/ruduino" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ruduino</a>, which only supports the Arduino Uno</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Rahix/avr-device" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">avr-device</a>, which provides low-level hardware control</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">avr-hal</a>, which provides higher-level board and <abbr title="Microcontroller">MCU</abbr> support, and depends on avr-device</li>
</ul>
<p>Although <a href="https://github.com/avr-rust/ruduino" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ruduino</a> is by the avr-rust team that worked on getting Rust working on AVR, I ultimately
decided to go with <a href="https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">avr-hal</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>It supports many more boards, and has a structure that allows it to expand further</li>
<li>
<p>It supports <a href="https://docs.rs/embedded-hal/0.2.*/embedded_hal/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">embedded-hal</a>, which allows us to share code between boards: for example, the
<a href="https://docs.rs/apa102-spi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>apa102_spi</code></a> crate will let us control APA102 LED strips on an Arduino Uno and a Raspberry Pi
running Linux, using the exact same code!</p>
<ul>
<li>embedded-hal also has a bigger focus on nonblocking operations, which is exactly what we're
looking for</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It has a cleaner and safer API</li>
</ul>
<p>To set that up:</p>
<p><strong>(Update 2020-07-26)</strong>: this is much simpler now with the latest nightly. All that is required:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>rustup <span>install</span> nightly
rustup +nightly component <span>add</span> rust-src</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="compiling-and-running">Compiling and Running</h2>
<p>We can compile by running</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>cargo +nightly build -Z build-std<span>=</span>core --release --target avr-atmega328p.json

cargo +nightly build --release</code></pre></div>
<p>Then, to upload it to a device, assuming that you have <code>avrdude</code> installed, run:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>avrdude -v -patmega328p -carduino -P/dev/ttyACM0 -b115200 -D -Uflash:w:target/avr-atmega328p/release/examples/serial.elf:e</code></pre></div>
<p>Change the upload path (<code>target/avr-atmega328p/release/examples/serial.elf</code>) to meet what you want
to upload.</p>
<h2 id="if-you-only-have-the-arduino-ide-installed">If you only have the Arduino IDE installed</h2>
<p>Enable "Show verbose output during: upload" in the Arduino IDE. Observe the build logs for an
<code>avrdude</code> command—it should look something like:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>/path/to/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avrdude/6.3.0-arduino17/bin/avrdude -C/path/to/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avrdude/6.3.0-arduino17/etc/avrdude.conf -v -patmega328p -carduino -P/dev/ttyACM0 -b115200 -D -Uflash:w:/tmp/arduino_build_721874/Blink.ino.hex:i</code></pre></div>
<p>Copy that command, but delete everything after <code>-Uflash:w:</code>. Then, without spaces, add the path to
your binary. This will typically be <code>target/avr-atmega328p/release/project_name.elf</code>, or
<code>target/avr-atmega328p/release/examples/example_name.elf</code>. Finally, add <code>:e</code>. Your final command
will probably look something like:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>/path/to/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avrdude/6.3.0-arduino17/bin/avrdude -C/path/to/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avrdude/6.3.0-arduino17/etc/avrdude.conf -v -patmega328p -carduino -P/dev/ttyACM0 -b115200 -D -Uflash:w:target/avr-atmega328p/release/project_name.elf:e</code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="what-about-converting-to-hex-first">What about converting to hex first?</h3>
<p>Arduino typically converts the compiled binary to raw hex, and many AVR-Rust projects have
<a href="https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal/blob/bfc5dfe67107a68b4a673e54532354af126cb3ba/mkhex.sh#L32" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">followed that pattern</a>. However, there's generally no need to do that, as <code>avrdude</code>
has the ability to upload ELF binaries directly.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="onto-async-operations">Onto <code>async</code> operations</h2>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, <a href="https://docs.rs/embedded-hal/0.2.*/embedded_hal/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">embedded-hal</a> is implemented in such a way that asynchronous operations is
quite easy. When you attempt to read or write a value, you can get three results:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>WouldBlock</code>: I can't complete this operation right now.</li>
<li><code>Ok</code>: The operation succeeded. If reading something, this gives you the read value.</li>
<li><code>Err</code>: An error occurred while performing this operation.</li>
</ul>
<p>This maps very nicely to Rust's <code>Future</code> trait, which is used to implement asynchronous code. For
example, reading from a serial port is implemented like this:</p>
<div data-language="rust"><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>poll_read</span><span>(</span>
    <span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>:</span> Pin<span>&lt;</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>Self</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    cx<span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> Context<span>&lt;</span><span>'_</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    buf<span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>[</span>u8<span>]</span><span>,</span>

<p>Although there's a bit of weirdness in terms of checking if the buffer is big enough, for the most
part, this works pretty well.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-always-return-1-byte-read">Why do I always return 1 byte read?</h3>
<p>I'm mostly mirroring the <code>AsyncRead</code> and <code>AsyncWrite</code> in the <code>futures</code> crate, which typically is
used on machines with full operating systems. Typically, the overhead of a syscall is somewhat
high, so you might request e.g. 1024 bytes at a time. Obviously, that isn't the case for an 8-bit
<abbr title="Microcontroller">MCU</abbr>. However, I'm keeping that pattern for ease of porting and to allow for networking, e.g. the
Arduino Ethernet shield.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, I copied and pasted the <code>AsyncReadExt</code> and <code>AsyncWriteExt</code> traits from the <code>futures</code> crate as
well. The way this is set up is that you just implement the low-level functions, and the <code>Ext</code>
traits take care of the more user-friendly functions. This is done instead of default
implementations to allow the main trait to be small in case it is added to the standard library,
much like how <code>Future</code> is in <code>std</code>/…</p></div></div>

July 25, 2020 | https://chris124567.github.io/2020-07-25-analysis-commercial-fingerprinting-service/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://chris124567.github.io/2020-07-25-analysis-commercial-fingerprinting-service/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190503172035/https://www.augur.io/">Augur</a> (2013-2017) was a commercial browser fingerprinting service, offered primarily to AdTech companies.  In this post I will analyze their tracking script and describe how it works and what information it collects.  The original copy of the script (<a href="https://cdn.augur.io/augur.min.js">https://cdn.augur.io/augur.min.js</a>) is no longer up; however, the Internet Archive still has a copy at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609184536js_/https://cdn.augur.io/augur.min.js">https://web.archive.org/web/20170609184536js_/https://cdn.augur.io/augur.min.js</a>.</p>

<h2 id="deobfuscating">Deobfuscating</h2>
<p>A first glance at the script shows a bunch of seemingly random characters (including emojis).  The was a hint to me that they were probably passing a big string into some deobfuscation function and <code>eval</code>ing it.  Passing the script through <a href="https://beautifier.io/">beautifier.io</a> shows exactly that.  The deobfuscation function has the following contents:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>        ...
        if (!''.replace(_(12), String)) {
            var z = {};
            for (i = 0; i &lt; 686; i++) {
                var y = x(i);
                z[y] = r[i] || y
            }
            t = _(15);
            y = function(a) {
                return z[a] || a
            };
            o = o.replace(t, y)
        } else {
            for (j = a[a.length - 1] - 1; j &gt;= 0; j--) {
                (r[j]) ? o = o.replace(new RegExp('\b' + (j &lt; 63 ? c.charAt(j) : c.charAt((j - 63) / 63) + c.charAt((j - 63) % 63)) + '\b', '\x67'), r[j]): 0
            }
        }
        return o.replace(_(11), "\n").replace(_(16), "\"")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To get the deobfuscated output, we can just copy the return statement but replace <code>return</code> with <code>console.log</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>        console.log(o.replace(_(11), "\n").replace(_(16), "\""));
        return o.replace(_(11), "\n").replace(_(16), "\"")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, we can just run the script in our browsers developer console and copy-paste the large output. The deobfuscated version can be found at <a href="https://pastebin.com/5Gdgxkxu">https://pastebin.com/5Gdgxkxu</a>.</p>

<h2 id="fingerprinted-attributes">Fingerprinted Attributes</h2>
<p>We will now look at the attributes collected by the script.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>* Cookie enabled status - navigator.cookieEnabled
* User agent - navigator.userAgent
* Emails in input forms - all non-hidden or blurred inputs are checked with a Regex for emails which are then associated with a Device ID
* If the site is using the Facebook SDK (window.FB is defined), call window.FB.api("/me") and return username and email.
* Do Not Track status - navigator.doNotTrack || navigator.msDoNotTrack
* Audio information - Creating a new HTML5 AudioContext and getting its sampleRate, maxChannelCount, numberOfInputs, numberOfOutputs, channelCount, channelCountMode, channelInterpretation
* Timezone - Creating a new Date object and calling getTimezoneOffset()
* Adblock status - Creating a new element with class "adsbox," adding some text to it, appending it to the body, and checking that its height equals 0 (if yes, then an adblocker is enabled)
* Canvas fingerprinting - Creating a new Canvas, drawing "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/" over it in multiple different colors with a rainbow background, then using the toDataURL function to get the base64 PNG representation
* Private Browser Mode detection - Trying to write data using localStorage, indexedDB, or requestFileSystem
* Font detection - Getting the width/height of the browser "fallback" (default) serif, sans-serif, and monospaces fonts, then measuring the width of a bunch of fonts (Augur's list has over 800) and seeing if there is any differences between the tested font and the defaults
* Media devices (speakers, cameras, microphones) enumeration - navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices
* Installed plugins enumeration - navigator.plugins
* Spoofing detection
    * Browser build number (always 20030107 on Chrome/Safari) - navigator.productSub
    * toString length of eval (33 on Chrome, 37 on Firefox/Safari, 39 on Internet Explorer) - eval.toString().length
    * Error toSource support (Firefox only)
* Touch support - navigator.maxTouchPoints || navigator.msMaxTouchPoints || "ontouchstart" in window || attempting to create a TouchEvent
* Local and remote IP addresses with WebRTC STUN
* GPU Information - Creating a Canvas with a WebGL context
    * MAX_TEXTURE_MAX_ANISOTROPY_EXT
    * getShaderPrecisionFormat

    * VERSION
    * SHADING_LANGUAGE_VERSION

</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I was shocked to find that Augur was silently collecting user’s Facebook information and all emails put in forms.  Apparently, this has been reported on <a href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2018/04/18/no-boundaries-for-facebook-data-third-party-trackers-abuse-facebook-login/">before</a>.  Otherwise, their fingerprinting was pretty comprehensive, but did not really feature any innovative or novel techniques.</p>

The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNtacp8-GoI" target="_blank">video</a>, at the time of writing, has 68,000 dislikes and 87,000 likes. Fans were disappointed at the lack of any major announcements given the drought in Nintendo Directs in recent months. The showcase highlighted <i>Shin Megamei Tensei 5</i>, <i>Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster</i>, some DLC for <i>Cadence of Hyrule</i>, <i>Rogue Company</i> and&nbsp;<i>WWE2K Battlegrounds</i>. That was it. No <i>Doom Eternal</i>, no <i>Bravely Default II</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>While I expect Nintendo will undoubtedly release more smaller Nintendo Directs in due course, there is a much greater issue here.&nbsp;</p><h3>Everyone is talking about the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X</h3><p>Nintendo needs to step up to get gamers talking about the Switch again. Right now, the hot topics are the next generation of consoles coming later this year. <a href="https://www.staticcatgames.com/2020/07/will-july-23rd-mark-success-or-failure.html" target="_blank">Microsoft's event on the 23rd</a> is on everyone's lips, for example. If Phil Spencer and co show off a lot of gameplay for <i>Halo: Infinite</i> and other first party games, this could turn out to be an incredible event.&nbsp; Microsoft's Xbox Series S/Project Lockhart is supposedly going to be unveiled in August, adding even more impetus.&nbsp;</p><p>I wouldn't be surprised if Sony released more information to combat the impact of Microsoft's event, perhaps even the price and launch date.&nbsp;</p><h3>What can Nintendo do to get the buzz going again?</h3><div><ul><li>Mario games in celebration of the 35th anniversary.</li><li>Announce <i>Breath of the Wild 2</i>.</li><li>Nintendo 64 games coming to the Switch.</li><li>New [insert old IP] here - imagine the reaction if a new <i>Wave Race</i> or <i>F-Zero </i>was announced?</li><li>Announce a Game Boy Classic.</li><li>Announce<i> GoldenEye 007</i> coming to the Switch.</li><li>Say "<a href="https://www.staticcatgames.com/2020/07/what-next-for-nintendo.html" target="_blank">Switch Pro</a> - coming 2021"</li></ul><p>What about Todd Howard showing a video of him playing <i>Fallout 3</i> (or 4) on the Switch? That would be incredible.&nbsp;</p><p>If Nintendo really wanted to do something EPIC, all it has to do is release a video of Phil Spencer playing <i>Halo: Infinite</i>...on a Switch running xCloud.&nbsp;</p></div><p><b>BOOM!&nbsp;</b></p><p>And the crowd goes wild.</p><h3>Closing thoughts</h3><p>There is always the risk of complacency. Nintendo could decide not to do anything until September, which might be damaging. I expect Sony will release more info about the PlayStation 5 at some point, especially since we don't know the price or launch date. There might be more gameplay footage to come. Microsoft might have a busy August if they announce the Xbox Series S/Project Lockhart then. Nintendo could make a splash by announcing <i>Super Mario Galaxy 1 &amp; 2 </i>on the Switch or S<i>uper Mario Sunshine Remastered. </i>That would guarantee a lot of interest and pre-orders.&nbsp;</p><p>What do you think?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <div>
  
  <p><span>24 Jul 2020</span></p><p>Let’s take the following code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>int * f()
{
    int x = 2;
    return &amp;x;
}

int g( int * p  )
{
    return 3 + *( p? f(): p );
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It has two errors in it. First, <code>f</code> returns a pointer to a local variable,
which goes out of scope. Second, the check in <code>g</code> is reversed; in the case
<code>p</code> is a null pointer, it dereferences it, instead of doing the opposite –
dereference <code>p</code> only when it’s not null.</p>

<p>This is what <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/rbn9KP">GCC emits</a> for <code>g</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>g(int*):
        mov     eax, DWORD PTR ds:0
        ud2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That is, it can obviously see that <code>g</code> will either dereference a null pointer
(undefined behavior), or an invalid pointer (undefined behavior), so it generates
code that dereferences a null pointer (<code>mov eax, [0]</code>), which crashes, and then
emits the guaranteed-invalid instruction <code>ud2</code>, which crashes.</p>

<p>(You can’t be too sure, is GCC’s motto.)</p>

<p>And this is what <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/zW5dzY">Clang emits</a> for the same function:</p>



<p>Presumably, the logic here is that one of the branches leads to undefined behavior,
and the other also leads to undefined behavior, so we might as well remove the whole
thing, it’s not going to get called anyway in a correct program. (But if it does, let’s
just return, as crashing would be gauche.)</p>

<p>Now, I don’t know about you, but I’m left wondering here; if the compilers can clearly
see that all possible code paths through this function lead to undefined behavior,
why don’t they <em>tell us that</em>? Something like “Warning: function invokes undefined behaviour
on all control paths, you might want to check your code, mate”, except less formal.</p>

<p>Who cares about that, some might say, nobody writes such code anyway, this will catch
no bugs. Well, I have obviously oversimplified a bit. Let’s take a slightly more
realistic example, such as this one:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>int slice_sum( std::vector&lt;int&gt; const&amp; v, int i, int n )
{
    int s = 0;

    for( int j = 0; j &lt; n; ++j )
    {
        assert( i+j &gt;= 0 );
        assert( i+j &lt; v.size() );
        
        s += v[ i+j ];
    }

    return s;
}

int f()
{
    std::vector&lt;int&gt; v{ 1, 2, 3, 4 };
    return slice_sum( v, 3, 2 );
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What does <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/5YGYYd">GCC do</a>?</p>

<div><div><pre><code>.LC0:
        .string "int slice_sum(const std::vector&lt;int&gt;&amp;, int, int)"
.LC1:
        .string "./example.cpp"
.LC3:
        .string "i+j &lt; v.size()"

f():
        sub     rsp, 8
        mov     ecx, OFFSET FLAT:.LC0
        mov     edx, 11
        mov     esi, OFFSET FLAT:.LC1
        mov     edi, OFFSET FLAT:.LC3
        call    __assert_fail
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Goes straight to <code>__assert_fail</code>, without passing Go and collecting $200.</p>

<p>What does <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/aP5qEW">Clang do</a>? Same thing.</p>

<p>Again, if the compilers can clearly see that calling <code>f</code> produces a guaranteed
assertion failure, why don’t they tell us?</p>

<p>Because we are put here on this planet to suffer, that is why.</p>

<p>(Also because <code>assert</code> is a macro that the compilers do not even see, and they
don’t know that <code>__assert_fail</code> is the assertion failure handler, and contracts,
which would have allowed us to write <code>[[assert: i+j &lt; v.size()]]</code> , were removed
from C++20 as being too useful, but those are just random second-order
manifestations of the cosmic need for suffering.)</p>

</p><p>
According to a report in The Information, an internal programme at Google known as "Android Lockbox" gives employees access to data on how Android users interact with popular, non-Google apps like </p><keyword keytype="UnKnown" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="TikTok" actualkeyword="TikTok">TikTok</keyword><p>, </p><keyword keytype="UnKnown" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="Facebook" keynameseo="facebook" actualkeyword="facebook">Facebook</keyword><p> and </p><keyword keytype="Company" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="Instagram" actualkeyword="Instagram">Instagram</keyword><p>.
</p><p>
    "When YouTube was planning the rollout of its rival to TikTok in India earlier this month, employees turned to a valuable source of market research: how people in the country were using TikTok and its competitors on Android", the report claimed.
</p><p>
<span>Advertisement</span></p><hr><p>The programme works via Google Mobile Services (GMS).
</p><p>
    "In some cases, such as YouTube in India, this data helps Google advance its own competing apps, say the people, all of whom requested anonymity to speak freely," the report added.
</p><p>
The Google employees can reportedly see "sensitive" data about other apps, including how often they're opened and for how long they're used.
</p><p><span>Advertisement</span></p><hr><p>Google-owned YouTube is working on a TikTok rival called Shorts, to be introduced by the end of this year.
</p><p>
"Google is also thought to have used the internal programme to plan the launch of its TikTok competitor called Shorts", according to the report.
</p><p>
    "Android Lockbox" works after Google users agree to share information as part of the Android setup process.
</p><p>
<span>Advertisement</span></p><hr><p>Users are told that this data allows Google to offer a more personalised experience. According to the report, it also provides data for competitive research.
</p><p>
    Google admitted that it has access to usage data from rival apps.
</p><p>
A Google spokesperson told The Verge in a statement: "Since 2014, the Android App Usage Data API has been used by Google and Android developers who have been authorized by Android OEMs or users to access basic data about app usage -- such as how often apps are opened -- to analyze and improve services".
</p><p>
<span>Advertisement</span></p><hr><p>"The API doesn't obtain any information about in-app activity and our collection of this data is disclosed to and controllable by users," the spokesperson was quoted as saying.
</p><p>
The US government is set to grill Google along with other tech giants over its dominance in their fields of Search and anti-market practices. The panel announced its antitrust probe into the tech giants in June last year.
</p><p>
    Google isn't the only company that's been accused of such data gathering practices.
</p><p>
<span>Advertisement</span></p><hr><p>In 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported that Facebook used a VPN service called Onavo to monitor rival services.
</p><p>
    Onavo Protect -- a Facebook's software that was going to get the functionality -- was billed as a piece of VPN software. Onavo was used primarily to gather information about what other apps Facebook users were using on their mobile devices.
</p><p>
The app was shut down in 2019.

<span><img src="https://pavelfatin.com/images/typometer.png" alt="Technical drawing of keyboard keys" title="Typometer"></span>Typometer is a tool to measure and analyze visual latency of text / code editors.</p>
<p>Editor latency is delay between an input event and a corresponding screen update, in particular case – delay between keystroke and character appearance. While there are many kinds of delays (caret movement, line editing, etc.), typing latency is a major predictor of editor usability.</p>
<p>Check my article <a href="https://pavelfatin.com/typing-with-pleasure">Typing with pleasure</a> to learn more about editor latency and its effects on typing performance.</p>
<p>Project source code is available as a <a href="https://github.com/pavelfatin/typometer">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<p>Download: <a href="https://github.com/pavelfatin/typometer/releases/download/v1.0.1/typometer-1.0.1-bin.zip">typometer-1.0.1-bin.zip</a> (0.5 MB)</p>
<p>Java 8 or latter is required to run the program. You can <a href="https://java.com/download">download Java</a> from the official site.<br>
<span id="more-1135"></span></p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux).</li>
<li>Native API calls for faster screen access.</li>
<li>Synchronous / asynchronous modes.</li>
<li>Import / export of CSV data.</li>
<li>Summary statistics, frequency distribution.</li>
<li>Line / bar charts (including comparative ones).</li>
<li>Chart image export (with legend).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Screenshots</h3>
<p>Main window:</p>
<p><img alt="Typometer, main window" title="Typometer, main window" src="https://pavelfatin.com/images/typometer/typometer-window.png"></p>
<p>Frequency distribution chart:</p>
<p><img src="https://pavelfatin.com/images/typometer/typometer-distribution.png" alt="Typometer, frequency distribution chart" title="Typometer, frequency distribution chart"></p>
<h3>Principle</h3>
<p>The program generates OS input events (key presses) and uses screen capture to fully automate the test process.</p>
<p>At first, a predefined pattern (“<code>.....</code>“) is inserted in editor window in order to detect screen metrics (start position, step, background, etc.).</p>
<p>After that, the program types a predefined number of “<code>.</code>” characters into the editor (with given periodicity), measuring delays between key presses and corresponding character drawings.</p>
<p>To achieve high accuracy of measurement, only a single pixel is queried for each symbol. Moreover, the program can use fast native API (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_API">WinAPI</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xlib">XLib</a>) calls on supported platforms, offering <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/Robot.html">AWT robot</a> as a fallback option.</p>
<p>There are two modes of testing available:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Synchronous</strong> – the program always waits for typed character to appear before making a pause and typing the next character. It’s the most accurate method (because there’s no threading overhead).</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronous</strong> – the program types and recognizes characters independently. This method is slightly less accurate, but it’s useful for testing rapid typing, when editor drawing might easily lag by multiple characters.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>To register only essential editor latency, text must be rendered directly to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framebuffer">framebuffer</a>, without intermediate image processing that might introduce additional delay. Prefer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacking_window_manager">stacking window managers</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing_window_manager">compositing window managers</a> for the testing purposes, particularly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch to Classic theme in Windows. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Aero">Windows Aero</a> enforces internal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_television#Vertical_synchronization">vertical synchronization</a>, which leads to minimum 1 frame lag (about 17 ms for 60 Hz monitor refresh rate) and delay discretization. It’s also possible to disable the compositing directly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021060058/http://www.softwareaudioconsole.com/Tweaking_Windows_7.htm">in Windows 7</a> and <a href="http://www.rlauncher.com/wiki/index.php?title=Input_Lag_Checklist#Disable_Desktop_Composition_in_Windows_8_and_8.1">in Windows 8</a>.</li>
<li>Use Linux distributive with lightweight <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager">window manager</a>, like <a href="http://lubuntu.net/">Lubuntu</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openbox">Openbox</a>). Complex, 3D-based windows managers might substantially increase system rendering latency, for example, on my hardware, Ubuntu’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiz">Compiz</a>, adds ~10 ms unavoidable lag.</li>
</ul>
<p>Close all programs that add system-wide keyboard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooking">hooks</a>, as they might process the keyboard events synchronously and affect the results (for example, <a href="http://www.workrave.org/">Workrave</a> is known to noticeable increase the typing latency).</p>
<p>You may consider switching your machine in a particular hardware mode (power scheme, integrated / discrete graphics, etc.). In power save mode (and on battery), for example, editor responsiveness is usually much lower, so it’s possible to detect significant performance glitches which are less frequently observable otherwise.</p>
<p>Before you start benchmarking, make sure that other applications are not placing noticeable load on your system. It’s up to you whether to “warm up” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine#Process_virtual_machines">VM</a>-based editors, so they can pre-compile performance-critical parts of their code before proceeding.</p>
<p>If possible, enable non-block caret (i. e. underline / vertical bar instead of rectangle) in editor. This might increase measurement accuracy.</p>
<p>Typical action sequence is the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Specify a measurement title, like “HTML in Vim” <em>(optional, can be set later)</em>.</li>
<li>Configure test parameters <em>(optional)</em>.</li>
<li>Launch an editor, maximize its window.</li>
<li>Open some data in the editor, for instance, a large HTML file <em>(optional)</em>.</li>
<li>Place editor caret in desired context (like comment, etc.), at the end of short / empty line.</li>
<li>Start benchmarking process in the program.</li>
<li>After a corresponding prompt, transfer focus to the editor window.</li>
<li>Wait for test completion, don’t interfere with the process.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can always interrupt the testing process simply by transferring focus back to the program window.</p>
<p>After test result is acquired, you may either analyze the singular data by itself or perform additional tests (different editors / conditions) to do comparative analysis.</p>
<p>Both source- and aggregate data is easily accessible, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>copy table content  as text,</li>
<li>save chart to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics">PNG</a> file (with legend and summary stats),</li>
<li>export raw data in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a> format (for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreOffice_Calc">Calc</a> or <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, if you fancy).</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s possible to merge results either by inserting data from an existing CSV file, or by appending data to a CSV file on saving.</p>
<h3>Recipes</h3>
<p>Here are a few tips on how you can use the tool to detect performance bottlenecks in text / code editors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check whether number of lines influences the latency. If so, typing might “lag” inside a large file.</li>
<li>Check whether editor window size influences the latency. If so, the editor probably does excessive repainting instead of drawing only a newly inserted symbol.</li>
<li>Check whether latency depends on horizontal symbol position. Ideally, that correlation should be undetectable.</li>
<li>Try to enable highlighting / autocomplete / folding / spellchecker / etc. Those features should be processed asynchronously, without affecting the typing as such.</li>
<li>Try to run the test in power-saving mode. Ideally, typing should be handled decently even on less powerful hardware.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re implementing a text / code editor, take a look at the <a href="https://pavelfatin.com/low-latency-painting-in-awt-and-swing/">programming techniques</a> to significantly reduce the drawing latency.</p>
<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>To make benchmarking possible, correct screen metrics must be detected at the initial step. The program attempts to recognize a custom pattern (5 new dots) in order to determine the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>starting position,</li>
<li>horizontal step,</li>
<li>background color,</li>
<li>line length,</li>
<li>caret type.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because there are many editors (and multiple versions of each editor), which looks different on different platforms, and there are many possible color schemes and fonts, the metrics recognition algorithm has to be very flexible. While the program sources contain a great deal of test cases, some glitches are still probable.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of typical problems and corresponding solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Editor background is non-uniform (gradient, picture) – set solid color background.</li>
<li>Characters are too low-contrast and obscure – use a crisp color scheme.</li>
<li>Dot characters merge with the caret – increase font size.</li>
<li>Editor replaces multiple dots with ellipsis – disable that auto-correction.</li>
<li>Spaces between dots are uneven – use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font">monospaced font</a> in the editor.</li>
<li>Editor has a left panel that melds with the text area – hide the panel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to contribute by creating additional test case images (check <code>/src/test/resources</code> directory for examples).</p>

Today we will go through the process of setting up an entire internal PKI backed by the security guarantee the HSM provides. First, we will generate a root CA with a private key living on the HSM’s hardware. Then, we will generate an Intermediate CA, whose private key will live secured by file system permissions in Linux. Then, we will walk through an example of generating a client certificate for use on internal endpoints. The root certificate can be distributed to the root certificate store of managed endpoints, and the machine used to generate the root CA’s private key can subsequently be kept offline.</p><p><img itemprop="url" src="https://cdn.ssltrust.com.au/assets/images/help/internal-pki-openssl-nitrokey-hsm/nitrokey-hsm.jpg" alt="Create an Internal PKI using OpenSSL and NitroKey HSM"></p><h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2><p>Before getting started, make sure to have setup a machine running Ubuntu Linux capable of talking to the NitroKey.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Concurrency is hard to get <em>correct</em>, at least for those of us unlucky enough to be writing in languages which expose directly the guts of concurrent hardware: threads and shared memory. Getting concurrency correct <em>and</em> fast is hard, too. Your knowledge about single-threaded optimization often won’t help you: at a micro (instruction) level we can’t simply apply the usual rules of μops, dependency chains, throughput limits, and so on. The rules are different.</p>

<p>If that first paragraph got your hopes up, this second one is here to dash them: I’m not actually going to do a deep dive into the very low level aspects of concurrent performance. There are a lot of things we just don’t know about how atomic instructions and fences execute, and we’ll save that for another day.</p>

<p>Instead, I’m going to describe a higher level taxonomy that I use to think about concurrent performance. We’ll group the performance of concurrent operations into six broad <em>levels</em> running from fast to slow, with each level differing from its neighbors by roughly an order of magnitude in performance.</p>

<p>I often find myself thinking in terms of these categories when I need high performance concurrency: what is the best level I can practically achieve for the given problem? Keeping the levels in mind is useful both during initial design (sometimes a small change in requirements or high level design can allow you to achieve a better level), and also while evaluating existing systems (to better understand existing performance and evaluate the path of least resistance to improvements).</p>

<h3 id="a-real-world-example">A “Real World” Example</h3>

<p>I don’t want this to be totally abstract, so we will use a real-world-if-you-squint<sup id="fnref:realworld"><a href="#fn:realworld">1</a></sup> running example throughout: safely incrementing an integer counter across threads. By <em>safely</em> I mean without losing increments, producing out-of-thin air values, frying your RAM or making more than a minor rip in space-time.</p>

<h3 id="source-and-results">Source and Results</h3>

<p>The source for every benchmark here is <a href="https://github.com/travisdowns/concurrency-hierarchy-bench">available</a>, so you can follow along and even reproduce the results or run the benchmarks on your own hardware. All of the results discussed here (and more) are available in the same repository, and each plot includes a <code>[data table]</code> link to the specific subset used to generate the plot.</p>

<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>

<p>All of the performance results are provided for several different hardware platforms: Intel Skylake, Ice Lake, Amazon Graviton and Graviton 2. However except when I explicitly mention other hardware, the prose refers to the results on Skylake. Although the specific numbers vary, most of the qualitative relationships hold for the hardware too, but <em>not always</em>. Not only does the hardware vary, but the OS and library implementations will vary as well.</p>

<p>It’s almost inevitable that this will be used to compare across hardware (“wow, Graviton 2 sure kicks Graviton 1’s ass”), but that’s not my goal here. The benchmarks are written primarily to tease apart the characteristics of the different levels, and <em>not</em> as a hardware shootout.</p>

<h2 id="level-2-contended-atomics">Level 2: Contended Atomics</h2>

<p>You’d probably expect this hierarchy to be introduced from fast to slow, or vice-versa, but we’re all about defying expectations here and we are going to start in the <em>middle</em> and work our way outwards. The middle (rounding down) turns out to be <em>level 2</em> and that’s where we will jump in.</p>

<p>The most elementary way to safely modify any shared object is to use a lock. It mostly <em>just works</em> for any type of object, no matter its structure or the nature of the modifications. Almost any mainstream CPU from the last thirty years has some type of locking<sup id="fnref:parisc"><a href="#fn:parisc">3</a></sup> instruction accessible to userspace.</p>

<p>So our baseline increment implementation will use a simple mutex of type <code>T</code> to protect a plain integer variable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>T</span> <span>lock</span><span>;</span>
<span>uint64_t</span> <span>counter</span><span>;</span>

<span>void</span> <span>bench</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>iters</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>iters</span><span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>lock_guard</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>holder</span><span>(</span><span>lock</span><span>);</span>
        <span>counter</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll call this implementation <em><abbr title="Uses a std::mutex and std::lock_guard to protect a plain integer counter.">mutex add</abbr></em>, and on my 4 CPU Skylake-S i7-6700HQ machine, when I use the vanilla <code>std::mutex</code> I get the following results for 2 to 4 threads:</p>



<p>The reported value is the median of all trials, and the vertical black error lines at the top of each bar indicate the <em>interdecile range</em>, i.e., the values at the 10th and 90th percentile. Where the error bars don’t show up, it means there is no difference between the p10 and p90 values at all, at least within the limits of the reporting resolution (100 picoseconds).</p>

<p>This shows that the baseline contended cost to modify an integer protected by a lock starts at about 125 nanoseconds for two threads, and grows somewhat with increasing thread count.</p>

<p>I can already hear someone saying: <em>If you are just modifying a single 64-bit integer, skip the lock and just directly use the atomic operations that most ISAs support!</em></p>

<p>Sure, let’s add a couple of variants that do that. The <code>std::atomic&lt;T&gt;</code> template makes this easy: we can wrap any type meeting some basic requirements and then manipulate it atomically. The easiest of all is to use <code>std::atomic&lt;uint64&gt;::operator++()</code><sup id="fnref:post"><a href="#fn:post">4</a></sup> and this gives us <em><abbr title="Uses an atomic increment on a single shared counter.">atomic add</abbr></em>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>uint64_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>atomic_counter</span><span>{};</span>

<span>void</span> <span>atomic_add</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>iters</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>iters</span><span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>atomic_counter</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The other common approach would be to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare-and-swap">compare and swap (<abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr>)</a> to load the existing value, add one and then <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr> it back if it hasn’t changed. If it <em>has</em> changed, the increment raced with another thread and we try again.</p>

<p>Note that even if you use increment at the source level, the assembly might actually end up using <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr> if your hardware doesn’t support atomic increment<sup id="fnref:atomicsup"><a href="#fn:atomicsup">5</a></sup>, or if your compiler or runtime just don’t take advantage of atomic operations even though they are available (e.g., see what even the newest version of <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/5h4K7y">icc does</a> for atomic increment, and what Java did for years<sup id="fnref:java"><a href="#fn:java">6</a></sup>). This caveat doesn’t apply to any of our tested platforms, however.</p>

<p>Let’s add a counter implementation that uses <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr> as described above, and we’ll call it <em><abbr title="Uses a CAS loop to increment a single shared counter.">cas add</abbr></em>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>uint64_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>cas_counter</span><span>;</span>

<span>void</span> <span>cas_add</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>iters</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>iters</span><span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>uint64_t</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>cas_counter</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>();</span>
        <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>cas_counter</span><span>.</span><span>compare_exchange_weak</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>))</span>
            <span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s what these look like alongside our existing <code>std::mutex</code> benchmark:</p>



<p>The first takeaway is that, at least in this <em>unrealistic maximum contention</em> benchmark, using <abbr title="Uses an atomic increment on a single shared counter.">atomic add</abbr> (<a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/xadd"><code>lock xadd</code></a> at the hardware level) is significantly better than <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr>. The second would be that <code>std::mutex</code> doesn’t come out looking all that bad on Skylake. It is only slightly worse than the <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr> approach at 2 cores and beats it at 3 and 4 cores. It is slower than the atomic increment approach, but less than three times as slow and seems to be scaling in a reasonable way.</p>

<p>All of these operations are belong to <em>level 2</em> in the hierarchy. The primary characteristic of level 2 is that they make a <em>contended access</em> to a shared variable. This means that at a minimum, the line containing the data needs to move out to the caching agent that manages coherency<sup id="fnref:l3"><a href="#fn:l3">7</a></sup>, and then back up to the core that will receive ownership next. That’s about 70 cycles minimum just for that operation<sup id="fnref:inter"><a href="#fn:inter">8</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Can it get slower? You bet it can. <em>Way</em> slower.</p>

<h3 id="level-3-system-calls">Level 3: System Calls</h3>

<p>The next level up (“up” is not good here…) is level 3. The key characteristic of implementations at this level is that they make a <em>system call on almost every operation</em>.</p>

<p>It is easy to write concurrency primitives that make a system call <em>unconditionally</em> (e.g., a lock which always tries to wake waiters via a <code>futex(2)</code> call, even if there aren’t any), but we won’t look at those here. Rather we’ll take a look at a case where the fast path is written to avoid a system call, but the design or way it is used implies that such a call usually happens anyway.</p>

<p>Specifically, we are going to look at some <em>fair locks</em>. Fair locks allow threads into the critical section in the same order they began waiting. That is, when the critical section becomes available, the thread that has been waiting the longest is given the chance to take it.</p>

<p>Sounds like a good idea, right? Sometimes yes, but as we will see it can have significant performance implications.</p>

<p>On the menu are three different fair locks.</p>

<p>The first is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticket_lock">ticket lock</a> with a <code>sched_yield</code> in the spin loop. The idea of the yield is to give other threads which may hold the lock time to run. This <code>yield()</code> approach is publicly frowned upon by concurrency experts<sup id="fnref:notwhat"><a href="#fn:notwhat">9</a></sup>, who then sometimes go right ahead and use it anyway.</p>

<p>We will call it <abbr title="A ticket lock that calls sched_yield in a spin loop while waiting for its turn.">ticket yield</abbr> and it looks like this:</p>



<div><div><pre><code><span>/**
 * A ticket lock which uses sched_yield() while waiting
 * for the ticket to be served.
 */</span>
<span>class</span> <span>ticket_yield</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>size_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>dispenser</span><span>{},</span> <span>serving</span><span>{};</span>

<span>public:</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>lock</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>auto</span> <span>ticket</span> <span>=</span> <span>dispenser</span><span>.</span><span>fetch_add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>memory_order_relaxed</span><span>);</span>

        <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>ticket</span> <span>!=</span> <span>serving</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>memory_order_acquire</span><span>))</span>
            <span>sched_yield</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>void</span> <span>unlock</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>serving</span><span>.</span><span>store</span><span>(</span><span>serving</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>()</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>memory_order_release</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s plot the performance results for this lock alongside the existing approaches:</p>



<p>This is level 3 visualized: it is an order of magnitude slower than the level 2 approaches. The slowdown comes from the <code>sched_yield</code> call: this is a system call and these are generally on the order of 100s of nanoseconds<sup id="fnref:spectre"><a href="#fn:spectre">10</a></sup>, and it shows in the results.</p>

<p>This lock <em>does</em> have a fast path where <code>sched_yield</code> isn’t called: if the lock is available, no spinning occurs and <code>sched_yield</code> is never called. However, the combination of being a <em>fair</em> lock and the high contention in this test means that a lock convoy quickly forms (we’ll describe this in more detail later) and so the spin loop is entered basically …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

Free speech is valuable when you are communicating with others: abstractly, freedom of speech means the right to distribute information to an audience.</p> <p>If you frame freedom of speech not in terms of what comes out of your mouth, but in terms of the interaction between yourself and another party,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> then edge cases rapidly emerge. For example, suppose that you are on the street, lawfully raising a protest sign supporting X. You are hoping to persuade passers-by. The government sends in <em>five hundred</em> counter-protestors, peacefully raising <em>not X</em> signs. Your voice is drowned out in the crowd. You are unable to reach the passers-by; it’s as if you were not there. Is this censorship? I am no constitutional lawyer, but the effect is undeniably censorious – it is practically as if you had been sent home by the police.</p> <p>Historically, I haven’t seen this type of scenario give rise to much concern among constitutional scholars – perhaps for reasons of practicality. Perpetually mobilizing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing">astroturf</a> brigades to drown out individual voices is hardly practically feasible.</p> <p>However, this has dangerously changed as discourse has moved online. The real-world constraints to astroturfing do not exist online. With <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-text-generator-gpt-3-learning-language-fitfully/">GPT-3</a>, the marginal cost of distributing astroturfed propaganda online has firmly hit zero. GPT-3 represents the newest generation of text-generating AI, and it is extremely good – perfectly indistinguishable from a human in short form, articulate, detailed, and capable of infinite variety in style and tone. Now it is actually possible for any online group discussion to be brigaded by thousands of automated users – indistinguishable from real humans – twisting the conversation, while drowning out the voices of real humans.</p> <p>This will become common in no time. It’s too effective a weapon for malicious states to pass it up. Manual online astroturfing is already widespread. Both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Water_Army">China</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Research_Agency">Russia</a> pay thousands of state employees to spread propaganda online. As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections">Russiagate</a> and the now widespread conspiracy theories on Antivax, 5G, COVID-19, etc. show, it’s very effective: social media platforms have enabled divide-and-conquer strategies at unprecedented scale and granularity. They have become a battleground for the opinions of people in the West, and these people haven’t realized it yet. Using fully automated, infinitely scalable tools to infect the minds of your opponents with malicious ideas and sow discord offers an unprecedentedly high ROI to the villains of the world.</p> <p>Thus, we are moving into a world where bad actors can interfere with free speech with a new form of censorship: the use of automated voices, indistinguishable from real ones, to overpower genuine voices online, and to shape the appearance of public discourse according to their goals. If you believe, as many scholars do, that democratic societies are critically reliant on your freedom to distribute information, then this poses a severe threat.</p> <p>The abstract problem is that on the internet, we don’t have a good way to tell real humans from fake ones. The current state-of-the-art tests are CAPTCHAs with challenges that “only humans could pass”: read the word, click all the squares with traffic lights, and so forth. Obviously these aren’t going to resist automation for long. They will be useless across the board in a few years, once general image recognition tools are as good as some substantial minority of humans.</p> <p>In the long term, AI will be effectively impossible to distinguish from humans online. The only solution is to use what we have and they don’t – real-world identification. A real-world ID could correspond to some set of private keys, so you could sign your online actions to prove their human authenticity. You could have a large number of private keys, so as to enable ample pseudonymity. However, true anonymity – not leveraging real-world identity in some sense – becomes impossible<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> without opening up the possibility of mass creation of automated trolls.</p> <p>In conclusion: free speech is not just about freedom from straight-forward censorship, but about your ability to participate in discourse without state interference. GPT-3 marks a new generation of tools enabling states to interfere in online discourse with unprecedented scale and persuasiveness, enabling great damage at low cost. It is clear that on the internet, AI will become indistinguishable from genuine humans in the next few years. To that extent, we have to protect our freedom of speech. It seems like requiring real-world IDs and coupling them with public key cryptography is the only way out, which keeps pseudonymity but loses anonymity.</p> <p>Losing anonymity to protect free speech is counter-intuitive and somewhat repulsive. I believe in individual freedom as the highest ideal. I used to think anonymity was one of the greatest values provided by the internet. And I acknowledge that eliminating anonymity to protect free speech comes with its own issues in the long run: for example, a malicious government could abuse the real-world-ID-to-private-key link to very effectively crack down on free speech. I don’t <em>like</em> the solution I am advocating, but it’s a difficult trade-off.</p>  <hr>  <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> DevOps doesn’t have to be all work and no play. I built 5 stupid (but fun!) GitHub actions… because <em>why not</em>?</p>
<p>The full code for these actions can all be found in this <strong><a href="https://github.com/sidpalas/stupid-actions">GitHub repo</a></strong>. I encourage you to fork and/or add issues/PRs with impractical actions of your own!</p>
<p>I also recorded a video about this project on <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-ugGAYVCo">YouTube</a></strong>. ← Check out the video and subscribe if you are into this sort of thing 🙏</p>

<h2 id="what-is-github-actions">What is GitHub Actions?</h2>
<p>GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform built into GitHub. It can be used to automate things such as building, testing, and deploying code and can be triggered by any GitHub event.</p>
<p>There is also a <a href="https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions">marketplace</a> where developers can publish their actions for others to use.</p>
<p>While I have used many CI/CD systems including Jenkins, Google Cloud Build, and CircleCI, prior to this project I hadn’t explored GitHub Actions, so I thought I would try it out and have some fun along the way.</p>
<p>Enough preamble, let’s get to the stupid stuff!</p>
<h2 id="the-actions">The Actions</h2>
<h3 id="1----holiday-reminder">1 – Holiday Reminder</h3>
<p>Starting simple with this first action, I take advantage of the fact that actions can be triggered on a cron schedule to create the following 10 line action:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>name</span>: holiday-reminder-happy-new-year
<span>on</span>:
  <span>schedule</span>:
    - <span>cron</span>: <span>'0 0 1 1 *'</span>
<span>jobs</span>:
  <span>happy-new-year</span>:
    <span>runs-on</span>: ubuntu-latest
    <span>steps</span>:
    - <span>name</span>: throw error
      <span>run</span>: exit <span>1</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The action will run at midnight on New Year’s day and fail every time due to the non-zero exit code. This will cause GitHub to send me an email wishing me a Happy New Year 🎉🎉🎉.</p>
<h3 id="2----recursive-action">2 – Recursive Action</h3>
<p>The next idea was proposed by a friend and former colleague (<a href="https://scotchka.github.io/)">https://scotchka.github.io/)</a>. He suggested that I make an action which triggers itself, thus creating an infinite chain of actions.</p>
<p>Given that the GitHub documentation explicitly states <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#triggering-new-workflows-using-a-personal-access-token">“To minimize your GitHub Actions usage costs, ensure that you don’t create recursive or unintended workflow runs,"</a> this seemed like a sufficiently stupid idea. To achieve this, I created an action triggered by commits that makes and commits a code change of its own.</p>
<p>There are two interesting parts to this action:</p>
<ol>
<li>GitHub helps prevent users from accidentally doing this by not triggering actions based on events associated with the default <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code>. In order to get around this, I created a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token">personal access token</a>. See the <a href="https://github.com/sidpalas/stupid-actions/blob/master/.github/workflows/recursive.yml">action yaml file</a> for how this gets used.</li>
<li>In order to prevent the infinite action chain, I persist a count of the action executions within a file in the repo and increment it with each execution. This allows me to terminate the action chain when I reach a specified limit.</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">COUNTER_FILE<span>=</span>./recursive/counter.txt
MAX_COUNT<span>=</span><span>5</span>

count<span>=</span><span>$(</span>cat <span>"</span>$COUNTER_FILE<span>"</span><span>)</span> 
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>(</span> $count &gt; $MAX_COUNT <span>)</span><span>)</span>;
<span>then</span> 
    echo <span>"Count too high... exiting"</span>;
<span>else</span>
    echo <span>"Count okay... continuing"</span>;
    echo <span>$((</span> $count <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>))</span> &gt; $COUNTER_FILE
    git config --global user.email <span>"<a href="https://devopsdirective.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="fb88929fbb9f9e8d948b889f92899e988f928d9ed5989496">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>"</span>
    git config --global user.name <span>"sid"</span>
    git add $COUNTER_FILE
    git commit -m <span>"Incremented counter file"</span>
    git push 
<span>fi</span>; 
</code></pre></div><h3 id="3----exponential-action">3 – Exponential Action</h3>
<p>The previous action has the potential to run indefinitely, but only one instance executes at a time, so it could be stopped manually if necessary. What if instead, the action triggered itself multiple times? This way, if it got out of hand there would be no stopping the exponential growth 😰. That sounds dumb… lets do it!</p>
<p>The file counter trick from before no longer works because multiple actions would be executing in parallel, all trying to modify and commit simultaneously causing conflicts. Instead, I stored the state in Git tags!</p>
<p>A random UUID is used as the base for the tag and the current iteration is appended to prevent collisions. The current implementation only support single digits, but if I make it past 9 iterations of exponential growth that means I messed up 💀.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>function</span> increment_tag_push <span>{</span>
    uuid<span>=</span><span>$(</span>uuidgen<span>)</span>
    suffix<span>=</span><span>$((</span> $count <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>))</span>
    tag<span>=</span>$1.$uuid.$suffix
    git tag -a $tag -m <span>"New UUID tag"</span>
    git push origin $tag
<span>}</span>

count<span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span>echo -n $GITHUB_REF| tail -c 1<span>)</span><span>"</span>

echo $GITHUB_REF
echo $count

sleep <span>10</span> <span># In case something goes wrong (this saved me during development 😳)</span>
MAX_COUNT<span>=</span><span>2</span>

<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>(</span> $count &gt; $MAX_COUNT <span>)</span><span>)</span>;
<span>then</span> 
    echo <span>"Count too high... exiting"</span>;
<span>else</span>
    echo <span>"Count okay... continuing"</span>;
    git config --global user.email <span>"<a href="https://devopsdirective.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="3f4c565b7f5b5a49504f4c5b564d5a5c4b56495a115c5052">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>"</span>
    git config --global user.name <span>"sid"</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>(</span>i <span>=</span> 1; i &lt;<span>=</span> $1; i++ <span>)</span><span>)</span>;
    <span>do</span>
    increment_tag_push $i
    <span>done</span>
<span>fi</span>; 
</code></pre></div><p>If you are looking for a quick way to burn through your 2000 free tier minutes… this is definitely the way to go!</p>
<h3 id="4----smart-lights">4 – Smart Lights</h3>
<p>Thus far, these actions have been implemented in small bash scripts. In order to actually explore the capabilities of GitHub actions I decided the next action should utilize <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-docker-container-action">Docker</a>.</p>
<p>I had a couple of WiFi smart plugs from VeSync that I received as a gift a few years ago and found a <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyvesync/">python client for their API</a>. This made it simple to create an action which turns the lights on for a short period of time after each commit (what better way to incentivize code velocity?!💡)</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://devopsdirective.com/posts/2020/07/stupid-github-actions/images/lights-off.gif" alt="images/lights-off.gif">
<figcaption>Lights on... Lights off!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The code for this one isn’t particularly interesting, but because the action is using more than just bash, it requires an <code>action.yml</code> file in which we can see how inputs get passed into the action:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>name</span>: <span>'Turn on Lights'</span>
<span>description</span>: <span>'Turn on smart home lights for a few seconds'</span>
<span>inputs</span>:
  <span>VESYNC_PASS</span>:  
    <span>description</span>: password for VESYNC_PASS
    <span>required</span>: <span>true</span>
<span>runs</span>:
  <span>using</span>: <span>'docker'</span>
  <span>image</span>: <span>'Dockerfile'</span>
  <span>env</span>:
    <span>VESYNC_PASS</span>: ${{ inputs.VESYNC_PASS }}
</code></pre></div><h3 id="5----tic-tac-toe">5 – Tic-Tac-Toe</h3>
<p>With the team starting to get a bit burnt out having to commit code constantly just to keep the lights on, I decided to implement a game of Tic-tac-toe to let them burn off some steam. The trick is that the computer player for this game executes within an action!</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://devopsdirective.com/posts/2020/07/stupid-github-actions/images/tic-tac-toe.png" alt="images/tic-tac-toe.png">
<figcaption>Command line interface + board state file</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I wanted to try out the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-javascript-action">Javascript runtime</a>, so I built the game with Node, persisting the board state in a text file. Since the point of this game was to learn about actions the computer’s strategy is random, but this has the added benefit of letting the human win, boosting morale 🤔.</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>Overall, GitHub Actions turned out to be fairly easy to work with and the option Dockerize the action steps ensures that it should be able to support pretty much any CI/CD need. Also, GitHub has made sharing and reuse of actions a core part of the experience through the Marketplace.</p>
<p>While I’m won’t be rushing off to port existing CI/CD workloads onto GitHub actions, I will certainly consider it for future greenfield projects!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in March, my kids were super excited for a few days off for their Spring Break. I took a week off so I could be home with them and not have to worry about work. I still haven’t been back to the office, and they haven’t been back to their school.</p>

<p>I doubt there’s anybody that’s not aware of the current world situation regarding COVID-19. In March, my kids’ school decided that the risk of having all those kids in one place was too great, and they moved to a “School from Home” setup. My work did pretty much the same thing.</p>

<p>I’ve been pretty fortunate in that my work supports a “From Home” option, and I’ve been full time from home before. I was already setup to do anything and everything I needed to do for my job right from my house.</p>

<p>My company offered basic supplies to take home if we needed them. Keyboards, mice, monitors, even chairs. I passed on pretty much all of that because I already have a good setup at home to work with. My laptop is all I need to work from pretty much anywhere in my house.</p>

<p>It’s been four months now. I confess, I’m burning out.</p>

<p>I recently attended a conference called SRE From Home, which was really interesting to me. One of the things said in one of the presentations stuck with me. To paraphrase, the reason we’re all burning out isn't because we’re working from home, it’s because we’re living at work.</p>

<p>That really struck home for me. I took a step back and really looked at how I’ve been doing this.</p>

<p>Before the pandemic, I got up in the morning at a fixed time. I showered, got myself and my kids fed, the kids off to school, and then I drove in to work. I plopped my laptop down on my desk at work and <em>that</em> is when my work day started. I did my job until the end of the day, and then I packed up my stuff into my laptop bag and I drove home. I picked up my kids, got dinner ready, did homework with them, and got them to bed. I’d sit with my wife on our couch and watch a TV show or two and then go to bed.</p>

<p>Now, during the pandemic, my schedule is entirely different. I still get up at a fixed time, but the kids don’t go to school and I don’t go to work. I walk the required fifteen steps from my bedroom to my office and I plop down at my desk with my computer already running and open. It never closes anymore. It’s always there. I go grab a quick lunch, but rarely actually take a lunch <em>break</em>. I eat in my office at my desk. When my kids come grab me to tell me they’re hungry, I fix them something to eat, and then I’m right back at my desk. Dinner time roles around, and it’s the same routine. Even after they’ve gone to bed, the computer is still there, open and waiting. I’ll check my email in the evening and manage some small tasks right up until the point I go to bed.</p>

<p>Looking at this now, I realize that I <em>never stop</em> working. If I’m awake, I’m at work.</p>

<p>This is something I’m going to have to change.</p>

<p>I did something different today. I have to work tomorrow for server upgrades, so I “left” early. I closed my laptop down at three o’clock, and I went and took a nap. I haven’t looked at my computer since. It’s still sitting there on the desk, but the lid is closed, and I’m not going to open it until tomorrow night for the upgrades. When those are done, the lid will close again, and I’m sleeping in on Monday.</p>

<p>There are four hours of work scheduled for me Saturday night to Sunday morning, and those are not going to be “Free Work Hours”.</p>

<p>I need to start setting boundaries. There needs to be a line between “work” and “not work”. If I can’t draw that line, I’m going to drive myself crazy.</p>

July 25, 2020 | https://blog.quidsentio.com/posts/building-a-shareable-personal-journal/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.quidsentio.com/posts/building-a-shareable-personal-journal/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have wanted to build a social network for 8 years, but it was much harder to
make software for the web back then. Also, 8 years ago, I was not even a
software developer yet, so there is that. But now I am (thanks
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp.org</a>!), and we are living in the
easiest time to be a software developer since Jeff Goldblum uploaded a virus to
an alien mothership.</p>
<h2>Quid Sentio</h2>
<p>The time was kind to my idea of what a social network should be too. It aged
well, and now it's time to uncork it. I am building <a href="https://www.quidsentio.com/">Quid
Sentio</a>, a shareable personal journal. I am not
calling it a social network site, but it is. Well, it will be. It's just the
basics now but open in public beta in the hopes someone will care.</p>
<p>What I am building now is much more mature than what I envisioned back then. The
core idea is the same -- keeping in touch with real friends, the closest friends
and family-- but the foundation is much more robust these days. In the meantime,
Path has come and gone, people saying they have quit Facebook have come and
gone, data leaks and privacy abuses have come and stayed.</p>
<p>I want to build Quid Sentio upon the principle of privacy. Privacy as freedom
from being observed. From being observed by non-friends, from being observed by
companies, from being observed by people who bought your data in the deep web
after a database leak.</p>
<p>The first two are just consequences of design and business choices. Adding a
little bit of friction for adding friends -- so no one can spam-add all their
contact list; keeping shared posts visible only by your direct friends -- so no
virality or friends of friends stalking you. A subscription-based business model
-- so no ads, no invasive tracking. The third level of privacy is not that
simple.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity is one thing that gets harder and harder to do in software
development. At the same time, services that do it better than me are more
accessible. This is the first reason why I decided to build my project using
other people's infrastructure.</p>
<p>The second reason is that I want to limit how many things I have to juggle in my
mind while building it. I read in Sapiens that the Cognitive Revolution started
70,000 years ago. I am pretty sure it ended when I made 40. Some things look
attractive from afar, but I can pass without them, and I am happy enough just
hearing people talking about it. Things that fall into that bucket are Finnegans
Wake, EVE Online, Dwarf Fortress, and Vim. Other things I cannot pass by
without, and I have no idea how to do it myself.</p>
<p>The inevitable implication is that I had to find other people to do my job for
me. I wanted to focus on building the UI, creating the application logic,
designing the experience that would make my product unique. Not the devops, not
the infra, not the data plumbing, none of those solved problems. I found people
that do these better than I could possibly ever do in Netlify and FaunaDB. There
is also other software taken for granted that are worthy, but not newsworthy at
this point. Like Stripe, AWS S3, and the plethora of open-source software that
are the buried giants whose shoulders I am standing on while pretending to be in
a mountain that I climbed all by myself.</p>
<p>Economics teaches you about comparative advantage. People in those companies
have the advantage of being smart; I have the advantage of using their service's
free tiers. Not sure I got that economics thing right.</p>
<p>The defining technical characteristic of my application is using good things
with bad names. I built it on a serverless architecture, which is the same as
calling food delivery "kitchenless food". I am using JAMstack, which is an
acronym for static websites or dynamic web apps using a stack with Javascript,
APIs and markup language but not like all those other websites and web apps that
also use Javascript, APIs and markup language in a totally different way. I
would be much happier calling serverless architecture, “Boaty”, and JAMstack,
“McBoatface”.</p>
<p>Still, just like Panama hats from Ecuador, they are great things. They are
powerful ideas, implemented, and popularized by great companies that I am using
to build mine.</p>
<h3>Netlify Build and Netlify Functions</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> is famous for how simple and intuitive it is
to create static sites that have hosting, continuous deployment, and CDN without
any hassle. With Netlify Functions, I can go one step further; I can make my
React site a dynamic application using APIs. Their serverless Functions make
creating an API a breeze; I drop a javascript function in a folder, deploy, and
I have an API.</p>
<p>Serverless is great for its smaller upfront costs (for low traffic, you are
usually still in free tier range) and zero infrastructure management needs.
Pay-as-you-go is a risk if you go too fast, but that’s not something I am
expecting. With Netlify Functions encapsulating the not that simple AWS Lambda
Functions, it has the extra bonus of keeping me away from the AWS Management
Console interface.</p>
<p>I have a fast CRUD app deployed in my domain, with minimal cognitive overhead.</p>
<h3>Fauna</h3>
<p><a href="https://fauna.com/">FaunaDB</a> is a distributed NoSQL database that is very well
suited to plug into serverless applications. NoSQL, with its flexible schema, is
a blessing for building new projects that will change a lot and quickly. I am
not building a typical social network; I am implementing original ideas that
might or might not work, that have changed and will continue to change as my own
ideas evolve and I get users' feedback. The data structure will reflect that. I
am a Javascript developer; I like how javascript notates its objects; it is
easier for me to understand and change a JSON object. It is also the obvious
solution for going serverless.</p>
<p>I have a safe, reliable, and fast database, with minimal cognitive overhead.</p>
<p><em>update: In the first version of this post I was using Userbase as
authentication solution. Since then, I decided to concentrate more on FaunaDB
tech, including their built-in user authentication.</em></p>
<h3>Putting everything to work</h3>
<p>Quid Sentio core entity is the journal entry. An entry can contain text, audio
recorded by the user, an image, a mood number selected from a range from -100 to
100, and custom tags. Each entry can also be shared and commented by friends.
This data looks like this for the user:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-demo-01.png" alt="Text entry screenshot">
<img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-demo-02.png" alt="Audio entry screenshot">
<img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-demo-03.png" alt="Image entry screenshot">
<img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-demo-04.png" alt="Mood entry screenshot">
<img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-demo-05.png" alt="Tags entry screenshot">
<img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-demo-06.png" alt="Sharing entry screenshot">
<img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-demo-07.png" alt="Commenting entry screenshot"></p>
<p>The entry data is pretty suitable for a JSON structure, as I have to fit all of
these, with its inherent grouping, in one database item. Images and audios are
stored at AWS S3, their URLs are stored at the database item too.</p>
<p>Another advantage is that I can -- and I will -- add more types of content that
the user can add to an entry. Audio, image, and custom tags were all added after
I launched the alpha version. I still consider video, maybe stickers, or other
more creative inputs that I learn from my users. The flexibility of adding more
properties to an entry while keeping it backward-compatible comes much more
naturally to NoSQL.</p>
<p>Quid Sentio is also social. The user creates an entry in their journal and can
then choose with whom, among their friends, they want to share it and allow to
comment on it. The user will also view all of their friends’ entries that were
shared with them. Each entry contains its permissions of access and list of
comments.</p>
<p>I keep the user’s list of friends as one of the profile properties that I keep
in a "Users" collection in FaunaDB. After user authentication I can access it
and then I can keep it in the state of my application. It is basically a list of
userIds, so no big deal. The tricky thing is to make the request that returns
only the entries from those friends who are authorized to be seen by the user.</p>
<p>This is where FQL shines. FQL is FaunaDB’s own query language, but I could use
GraphQL (also supported by FaunaDB) with similar results. I can easily create a
query from a Netlify Function that only brings the authorized entries without
the need of writing a lot of code with the logic required to not expose
unauthorized entries to the client. So it ends up being pretty fast and simple
to get the user’s friends’ entries and show this:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/screenshot-friends-entries.png" alt="Text entry screenshot"></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I had many technical obstacles between me and the social network that I wanted
to build. Then modern services started to arrive, one by one, and, with more
ease than expected, I got it done. I create-react-apped an app, deployed with
Netlify, wrote Netlify functions for the basic operations, integrated with
Fauna's NoSQL serverless database, including its built-in user authentication,
inserted a Stripe handled checkout page and voilà. The only thing in front of me
now is my vision. And I have all my cognitive resources preserved to reach it.
Or to be consumed trying to write smart comments on Hacker News. Only time will
tell.</p>

<p>My brain basks in this planning process. It feels so productive, but it involves minimal mental effort.</p>
<p>Time and time again this cycle occurs. When it comes to getting down to real work, the euphoric rush fades. It turns out planning is easy and action is hard.</p>
<p>Before long, my interest dies down and it’s onto the next topic. And so the cycle continues.</p>
<p>This happened until I heard a story of two men learning to fish. The first fisherman heads to the marina and buys the best fishing boat money can buy. He specs out a custom carbon fiber rod and spends thousands on a deep-water GPS. He spends time reading up on different casting, reeling, and baiting techniques. A few months later, he feels ready to fish.</p>
<p>But by the time he casts his first line, the second fisherman has sucked the lake dry. </p>
<p>On day one, the second fisherman grabbed a shitty rod, sliced up a hot dog, and started fishing. Every day he honed his technique, finding bait which worked a little better or a spot that had a few more nibbles. After three weeks of iteration, he found the winning combo.</p>
<p>Before long, he was hauling in hundreds of fish every day. From there he opened a restaurant to sell his fresh fish. And then he opened a fishing school to teach others his craft. All while the first fisherman gathered gear.</p>
<p>The moral of this story?</p>
<p>Get to action as quickly as possible.</p>
<p><strong> When you find yourself gathering gear, grab a shitty rod and start fishing.</strong></p>

				<div>
					<p>Ever tried dealing with a large company, only to get stonewalled? You're talking to a black box that repeats “Sorry, that’s against policy” or “I can’t do that”</p><p>But if you can open up that box the picture changes. The moving pieces become visible. Watch how each one ticks, and you’ll start noticing the systems at play.</p><p>Leaders design incentives to be armor plating for the company, protecting its interests. They work well for the most part, but all plating has seams.</p><p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1162561822248992768">Dangerous Professional</a> finds those seams and slips between them. &nbsp;They'll dodge gatekeepers and dance around policies, doing whatever it takes to get the job done.</p><p>Companies setup divisions with the job of managing all the incoming complaints. You know them as customer service. &nbsp;Depending on whether you’re that <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/doug-rushkoff-hello-etsy">company’s customer or their product</a>, customer service’s role varies from “keep them happy with minimal effort” to “get these people off our backs.” They’re the ones companies want you to contact.</p><p>When customer service isn’t being that helpful, look for someone else to complain to. Like the CEO.</p><p>Jeff Bezos is famous for reading all customer emails sent directly to him. When a complaint lands in his inbox he forwards it to one of his reports with just a question mark added: ‘?’. Whenever anyone gets this email <a href="https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/5-years-later-jeff-bezos-just-confirmed-jeff-bezos-question-mark-method-that-scares-heck-out-of-everyone-at-amazon-heres-how-it-works.html">they drop everything and scramble</a> to solve that customer’s problem. The customer service department doesn’t have that kind of clout.</p><p>I witnessed this at Microsoft. The VP got a complaint and forwarded it down to his direct report.</p><p>Which got forwarded down again. And again. And again. Each level adding one more manager’s weight. Propelling it faster and faster and faster till it smashed into my team’s inbox at critical velocity. All hands on deck!</p><p>Why did &nbsp;this work? Look at what’s happening behind the scenes. Your message went to someone with just enough time to say "This might be important, I’ll delegate it to the relevant team." And it gets fast tracked through the chain of command</p><p>A funny bit of management psychology comes into play here: If your boss’s boss’s boss tells you to “look into this please,” it jumps to top of your priority list. Usually folks don’t bother to ask if it should be prioritized higher or lower than the large pile already on their plate.</p><p>Achievement unlocked: Teleport to front of line.</p><p>Many businesses have departments tasked with nothing but creating rules other departments must follow. Some of those rules get really weird:</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m continuously amazed by how many people have to ask permission to buy a $50 book, yet are empowered to call a meeting that costs tens of thousands of dollars.</p>— HydroxyCoreyQuinn (@QuinnyPig) <a href="https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1103868678389420033?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 8, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>Once I was going on a business trip to help with a conference. My company had instituted a hotel budget of $250 per day. But this was a BIG conference. Hotel prices were jacked up, and only the sketchiest places met that price point.</p><p>The cheaper hotels were 30 minutes away, but then I’d blow the budget for uber rides. I asked if I'd have to cancel my conference trip.</p><p>Manager: “There’s not actually an uber limit”</p><p>Oh.</p><p>I booked that distant hotel and took an uber everyday. Now here’s the kicker: the hotel + uber cost <em>more </em>than what I would have paid if I had gotten a hotel walking distance from the venue. But that’s too complicated for the finance department to write formal rules around. Imagine if they prevented people from getting a ride when it was <em>really </em>needed!</p><p>Thus the current policy was born.</p><p>It gets better. When you see the policy’s red lines drawn out, you can walk around them like Danny Ocean’s crew navigating a laser maze. </p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mr834Cs9ncs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Good sales reps know this and use it to push deals through. Patrick McKenzie <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1284404823572410369">offers an example</a>:</p><p><em>"Suppose you are selling a $100k product to a director who has $100k budgeted for it. You do the dance. Purchasing says they need a 10% discount because We're Big Enough To Always Demand One.</em></p><p><em>Three days later you submit the following: $100k invoice, discounted 10%, for 1 year of SaaS services. Comes out of software budget. $12k invoice, discounted 10%, for 1 year commitment to professional services. Comes out of consulting budget.</em></p><p><em>Purchasing is *extremely* likely to approve this."</em></p><p>Did the company hire people who couldn’t do basic math? Of course not.</p><p>They pay people who know <em>where their time will be most valuable</em>. Writing a policy that covers 95% of situations will take them 10 hours and saves the companies $XX millions of dollars. Writing policies to cover the remaining 5% will take ten times as long and only offer a tiny fraction of the savings. The cost/benefit analysis doesn’t work out.</p><p>If you learn what was left in that missing 5% you'll have the advantage.</p><p>Remember there is no “company.” All of the company’s decisions are actually individuals acting within their own set of incentives. The “company” is what emerges when those individual incentives interact with each other.</p><p>You don’t have to fight the entire company.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/07/there-is-no-spoon.png" alt=""><figcaption>There is no company</figcaption></figure><p>Hidden incentives exist in your own company too. Is a team resisting doing something you’re asking for? Learn why. Find the fulcrum point. New paths will emerge.</p><p>For example, I used to struggle with people not responding to my emails when I tried to get their approval on a change I was making. “People are busy,” my manager explained. “Instead say, ‘I’ll be making this change on Thursday unless you object before then.’” </p><p>I started doing that.</p><p>The objections were rare. The complaints, non-existent.</p><div><p>You get the best results when you adapt your approach to the person you’re facing</p><p>Now replace "person" with "team" or "department"</p><p>The sentence remains true</p></div><p>Figuring out each team's incentives can <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/whats-it-like-as-a-senior-engineer#research-like-a-detective">take some detective work</a>. But once you understand them you’ll learn what makes each group tick. As you get better at this you’ll find yourself able to collaborate with others much more effectively and Get Stuff Done.</p>

"""

Chaos theory is a branch of mathematics focusing on the study of chaos—states of dynamical systems whose apparently-random states of disorder and irregularities are often governed by deterministic laws that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. Chaos theory is an interdisciplinary theory stating that, within the apparent randomness of chaotic complex systems, there are underlying patterns, interconnectedness, constant feedback loops, repetition, self-similarity, fractals, and self-organization. The butterfly effect, an underlying principle of chaos, describes how a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state (meaning that there is sensitive dependence on initial conditions). A metaphor for this behavior is that a butterfly flapping its wings in China can cause a hurricane in Texas.

Small differences in initial conditions, such as those due to errors in measurements or due to rounding errors in numerical computation, can yield widely diverging outcomes for such dynamical systems, rendering long-term prediction of their behavior impossible in general. This can happen even though these systems are deterministic, meaning that their future behavior follows a unique evolution and is fully determined by their initial conditions, with no random elements involved. In other words, the deterministic nature of these systems does not make them predictable. This behavior is known as deterministic chaos, or simply chaos. The theory was summarized by Edward Lorenz as:

"Chaos: When the present determines the future, but the approximate present does not approximately determine the future."

Chaotic behavior exists in many natural systems, including fluid flow, heartbeat irregularities, weather and climate. It also occurs spontaneously in some systems with artificial components, such as the stock market and road traffic. This behavior can be studied through the analysis of a chaotic mathematical model, or through analytical techniques such as recurrence plots and Poincaré maps. Chaos theory has applications in a variety of disciplines, including meteorology, anthropology, sociology, physics, environmental science, computer science, engineering, economics, biology, ecology, pandemic crisis management, and philosophy. The theory formed the basis for such fields of study as complex dynamical systems, edge of chaos theory, and self-assembly processes.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It must have been about a year ago, just after I moved from San Francisco here to New York. I was having steaks with my good friend and soon to be business partner, Kyle. Kyle and I transferred to Vanderbilt at the same time, were placed a few doors down from each other in an awful, mold-ridden dorm which we would both soon move out of (and which was knocked down by the time we graduated), and spent our first night on campus drinking whiskey together with another future friend of ours. Over the next few years, Kyle and I hung out a lot, studied together often and discussed a lot of business and investing ideas while procrastinating from said studies. This past year, a few months after the aforementioned dinner, we bought in 50/50 on a real estate investment, a multi-family duplex in his hometown of Lexington, Kentucky. I never imagined that I would become a Kentucky homeowner, but because of Kyle, now I am. Our investment is going very well so far and I am confident that Kyle and I will be doing a lot more together in the future, real estate or otherwise.</p>



<p>Going back to that dinner, over my ribeye and glass of wine and his filet and Coca-Cola, Kyle and I discussed where each of us were and where we wanted to be headed, in terms of our careers mostly as the majority time consumers of our lives in general. I was working as many hours as ever in investment banking and he had recently moved on from banking and into equity research. In discussing his decision to make the transition, he made a somewhat obvious point that I think tends to get overlooked and underestimated nonetheless, which is why I am choosing to write about it today. That is, he pointed out that we should be thinking about the value of our time in terms of hours rather than years.</p>



<p>Most career-oriented jobs advertise salary to their prospective applicants. I used to think of my income in investment banking as a combination of salary and bonus because the latter comprises an unusually large percentage of most people’s overall annual income in the industry (i.e. the end of year bonuses are often more or less equal to annual salaries for top performers).</p>



<p>After Kyle’s comment, I started to think about income more often in terms of dollars per hour. Think about the following hypothetical. All other things equal, would you rather work 80 hours per week for $100,000 or 40 hours per week for $75,000? The former pays $24 / hour and the latter pays $36 / hour. Most logical people would opt for the latter as the difference in the hourly rate is just too great. The decision would be more difficult however if the 40 hours per week job only paid $60,000. In that case, the income per hour of the 40 hours per week job ($29) would still be greater than that of the 80 hours per week job ($24), but the larger difference in annual salary becomes a bit more difficult of a pill to swallow ($100,000 – $60,000 = $40,000). I am not advocating for choosing one job over the other, even in this idealistic situation where everything else was somehow exactly equal, which of course in real life it would never be. I am simply advocating for people to more deliberately consider the time they expect to give in exchange for a salary when considering an offer.</p>



<p>Further on the hypothetical situation above, even if you were to take the 40 hour per week job at a salary of $75,000 and you are one of the increasingly popular breed of millennials who wants to work 80 hours per week still, that is totally fine. You can spend your time working on things that you are interested in and passionate about, invest your time in learning new skills and/or subjects, or if short-term income is your primary focus, get another part-time job or create your own side hustle for evenings and/or weekends. If you make more than $12 / hour for 40 additional hours of work, you would make more annually than the 80 hour per week job that paid $100,000.&nbsp; For comparison’s sake, the much debated minimum wage for food service workers in New York City is $15 / hour…</p>



<p>Moreover, as with most other things, when it comes to your free time, or disposable time as I prefer to call it, scarcity increases value. The less disposable time you have, the more precious it becomes, the more valuable it becomes. Think about it in extremes. If you had no disposable time (free time to do with what you wish), you would not be able to sleep at your own discretion (this is unfortunately a reality for some people who work long hour jobs or multiple jobs including night shifts). As such, most people would demand more money in exchange for working their 16<sup>th</sup>, 17<sup>th</sup>, and 18<sup>th</sup> hour of the day than the 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, and 6<sup>th</sup>. They probably have at least six hours set aside to work anyway and will take what they can get in terms of income in exchange for that time. The 16<sup>th</sup>, 17<sup>th</sup>, and 18<sup>th</sup> hours on the other hand cut into the human necessity of sleep and for that reason they are very valuable. The same goes for the less extreme hours in between. There must be a gradual increase in the value of every hour between those two ranges of hours. The less disposable time you have, the more important are the things you have to cut for work such as time for meals with family or friends, time to go to the gym, time to read a book or watch TV, and time to just relax or enjoy your weekends.</p>



<p>Of course, this point about considering income per hour rather than annual salary cannot be considered in a vacuum because there are a host of other related factors that are also important in making decisions around what to do for money. For example, if the day to day composition of your work includes a number of tasks, practices and activities that you like or even love doing or that you might be doing anyway if you had the freedom to choose what to do with your time, then you should be willing to accept less income in exchange for your time because there is less of a difference in the enjoyment or utility of what you have to do for that income versus what you might otherwise be doing.</p>



<p>Once in a while you hear people who love their jobs say things like “I feel like I have never worked a day in my life” or “If money was not a thing, I would be doing exactly the same work that I am doing now”. Those people are mostly outliers and exceptions for now, but the optimist in me convinces the pragmatist that one day in the not too distant future it will become much more common as more menial tasks become automated and some form(s) of universal basic income increasingly provides people with more disposable income/time to live their lives as they please. In the meantime, most of us will continue to feel that we have to make some sort of trade off involving time for money. I suggest that we think about that trade-off in terms of hours as opposed to years. Forget salary.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>At the beginning of this year, I decided it was finally time to port my website from a <span>PHP</span>-based <span>CMS</span><sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> to a JavaScript-based Static Site Generator (<span>SSG</span>). This was for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>After starting out as a ‘full-stack’ developer, I now work solely on the front end: If I need to write custom functionality, I don’t want to write it in <span>PHP</span> when I could be writing it in JavaScript.</li>
<li>I don't need the layers of abstraction or the complexity of a <span>CMS</span> — markdown files are where I'm most comfortable writing content and I’d be happy never to touch a My<span>SQL</span> database or <span>wysiwyg</span> editor again.</li>
<li>I want to improve my site’s performance: static <span>HTML</span> files are, 99 times out of 100, going to be faster than pages built on the fly.</li>
<li>Lastly, there’s the cost benefit: A <span>LAMP</span> stack<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> server costs money every month; Netlify’s free tier (300 build minutes/month) should comfortably cover a personal blog at zero cost.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once I'd decided I want a Static Site Generator and it needed to use JavaScript (which ruled out <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>), I narrowed the list down to two very different contenders:</p>
<h2>“I heard Gatsby was good”</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">the official site</a>, “Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps”. It has a data layer powered by GraphQL and it outputs everything to static files, allowing you to host it pretty much anywhere.</p>
<p>When I first heard that I could write React and use this cool new GraphQL thing, while still outputting static pages that work without JavaScript, I was keen to give it a try. <em>‘This sounds like Progressive Enhancement but without the effort’</em> I thought. Unfortunately, as with most things that sound too good to be true, after some investigation, there turned out to be a catch. Here's what happens the first time a user visits a Gatsby site:</p>
<ol>
<li>The user requests a page</li>
<li>The server sends the statically-generated <span>HTML</span> document to the user’s browser and the browser starts rendering the page.</li>
<li>Now that the <span>HTML</span> document has arrived, the JavaScript bundle (including the React library and any other JavaScript required to render the page) begins downloading, parsing and compiling in the background</li>
<li>The JavaScript is ready to run — the whole <span>DOM</span> gets “hydrated”<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> with React components</li>
</ol>
<p>There’s something not quite right here — Gatsby forces you to load the same page again, but as React components; until that extra step is complete, none of the elements that require JavaScript (e.g. buttons, menus, custom inputs) are actually interactive.</p>
<p>If your site doesn’t have any interactive elements (excluding links, they work without JavaScript, even in Gatsby), your users still have to download this JavaScript anyway, for the sole purpose of turning your site into a Single-Page Application (<span>SPA</span>), which has its own drawbacks as we'll soon discover.</p>
<p>This extra bloat seems to go against one of the main reasons for moving to a <span>SSG</span>: making pages faster. Your flashy Gatsby site might be fast on a $2,000 MacBook, but for someone using a budget smartphone on a 3G connection, it's visible yet unresponsive, for 15 seconds while the user waits for the JavaScript to load. It’s also unnecessarily draining their battery <em>and</em> data allowance.</p>
<p>If the browser needs to parse 296kb of JavaScript<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> to show a list of blog posts, that’s not Progressive Enhancement, it’s using the wrong tool for the job. To use the rather fuzzy website/web app distinction — React is for building web apps: interactive UIs that need to respond to user input or fetch data in real time — your blog is just a website <em>and that’s fine</em>.</p>
<h2>Accessibility in single-page applications</h2>
<p>A single-page application is a website that forgoes the traditional method of navigation on the web, i.e. loading new content by loading a new <span>HTML</span> document; instead it uses JavaScript features like <span>AJAX</span> and the History <span>API</span> to swap in new content without triggering a page load. The goal is to increase perceived performance and make the website feel more like a 'native' app (something you’d download from an app store). The problem with getting rid of full-page reloads is that browsers and assistive technology use page loads as a signal to trigger certain useful behaviours, including announcing the title of the new page or resetting keyboard focus to the beginning of the document.</p>
<p>If you’re an accessibility-conscious developer building a single-page application, you may try to emulate the browser’s behaviour using JavaScript. Gatsby attempts to handle this for you by including a <code>RouteAnnouncer</code> component. This uses an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions"><span>ARIA</span> live region</a> to announce the <code>title</code> or <code>h1</code> of the page, alerting users of screenreader software to navigation changes. This approach, however, is not without its problems: there are still outstanding issues around <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/21059">configuration</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/20801">localisation</a>.</p>
<p>We’ve seen that the Single-page applications have inherent accessibility issues around navigation, but it’s worth bearing in mind that using a front-end framework can make other aspects of accessibility harder too. In a February 2020 survey of one million homepages, WebAIM found that those using React had 5.7% more accessibility errors than average; while those using Vue had 25% more<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup>. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the frameworks caused these errors, but there’s a strong correlation between more JavaScript and worse accessibility.</p>
<h2>Does a blog even need JavaScript?</h2>
<p>Chances are, the first webpage your ever built performed far better than some of the pages you've built since — it consisted of an <span>HTML</span> file and some <span>CSS</span>; maybe it had a few unoptimised images but they didn’t stop the page from loading. If you're anything like me, the moment you started adding JavaScript was the moment the performance of your webpage took a nosedive. Not all bytes are made equal: an image is going to take far less time to decode and render to the screen than the equivalently sized JavaScript file would take to parse, compile, and execute<sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>JavaScript is a powerful language that can do some incredible things, but it’s incredibly easy to jump to using it too early in development, when you could be using <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span> instead. Consider the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower.html">rule of least power</a>: Don’t use the more powerful language (JavaScript) until you’ve exhausted the capabilities of less powerful languages (<span>HTML</span>). To me, it feels that turning a blog into a JavaScript Single-page application is introducing unnecessary complexity.</p>
<p>I don't want this post to come across as a specific attack on Gatsby. There are some clever people behind it, who’ve acknowledged many of the issues mentioned in this article and are trying to solve them. A statically rendered and hydrated page is still infinitely better than a fully client-side rendered React app (like those generated by <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">create-react-app</a>) which is useless without JavaScript. I do have issues with the way that its JavaScript-heavy, Single page app approach is advertised, <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2020-01-30-why-gatsby-is-better-with-javascript/">including in Gatsby’s own marketing</a>, as appropriate for any kind of website. Client-side JavaScript has a cost and developers should be aware of it.</p>
<h2>Building a Gatsby site with less JavaScript</h2>
<p>This brings me to a dilemma: developing sites with Gatsby is an all-round great experience; but Developer Experience (DX) should always be secondary to User Experience (UX) — how do I build a Gatsby site without the issues inherent in Gatsby’s JavaScript-heavy approach? By removing as much of it as possible, of course. Fortunately, there are some fantastic efforts going on within the Gatsby community to build faster, more lightweight sites:</p>
<p>Firstly, you could save a few kilobytes by swapping React for Preact, with <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-preact/">gatsby-plugin-preact</a>. I use this on <a href="https://component.gallery/">the Component Gallery</a> and it works seamlessly, instantly knocking ~30kb off the JavaScript payload.</p>
<p>If you want to take a more drastic approach, there's a <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-no-javascript/">plugin which removes <em>all</em> the Gatsby JavaScript from your Gatsby site</a>. Now we’re getting somewhere! You can continue to write react components and GraphQL, even use a CSS-in-JS library (as long as it outputs CSS or inline styles), <em>without</em> sending any JavaScript to the browser. Most of the problems with Gatsby can be solved by throwing out all of its client side JavaScript. <a href="https://gatsby-starter-low-tech-blog.netlify.com/low-tech/">Gatsby Starter Low Tech Blog</a> uses the no-javascript plugin, as well as some other techniques including converting all images to greyscale, to help you create an incredibly lightweight and energy-efficient blog.</p>
<h2>Starting from scratch with Eleventy</h2>
<p>At this point I felt like something was wrong — using a framework that heavily pushes client-side JavaScript, but removing all of that JavaScript seemed like a pretty convoluted way to build a website. I wanted to see whether I could build a fully-featured blog with zero client-side JavaScript and instead of using a plugin to remove it, I wasn’t going to add it in the first place. This is where my other contender comes in:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> encourages you to build your site how you want to. You use the technology you're most comfortable with and it sticks to generating your pages. Eleventy gives you the option of mixing and matching ten different templating languages, including markdown, nunjucks, and liquid; this meant I could copy and paste my old twig templates from Craft, change the file extension, and with some minor tweaks have them running in Eleventy. Instead of adapting my front-end build process to a new bundler I could just drop in my existing webpack file and <code>src</code> folder. Using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently">concurrently</a> package I can run my build script at the same time as Eleventy’s <code>serve</code> process.</p>
<p>Like Gatsby, Eleventy also has an ecosystem of plugins (which is small, but rapidly growing). I’ve picked out a few that I've used which have enabled me to add features without adding client-side JavaScript:</p>
<p>When displaying code snippets in a post, it’s common to include language-specific syntax highlighting. There are a few JavaScript libraries out there that can do it, the most popular of which seems to be <a href="https://prismjs.com/">Prism</a> — normally you’d run this in the client, but because …</p></div></div>

Apple in a support bulletin said that using tapes/physical covers could eventually degrade the webcam and damage the MacBook display. The Apple <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211148">advisory</a> says that MacBook users should just rely on the indicator light that shows when the camera is active.</p><p>Apple explains that using a webcam cover, such as a small piece of tape, could actually break down features like the ambient light sensor or True Tone. Apple may have its reasons to warn MacBook users, but Librem Linux smartphones and laptop makers don’t like Apple’s advice. In a <a href="https://puri.sm/posts/apple-has-no-tolerance-for-webcam-covers/">blog post</a>, Purism Chief Security Officer, Kyle Rankin says Apple’s advice is ‘discouraging’ from a security point of view. Rankin says that Apple wants its users to follow the “just trust us” policy which is very unsound cybersecurity advice to give.</p><p>“While this advice is consistent with Apple’s overall “just trust us” approach to security, it completely misses the point of why people used webcam covers to begin with: to claw back the tiniest bit of control over their privacy from hardware and software companies,” Rankin says in the post.</p><p>Rankin is very critical of this sort of cybersecurity approach and says that Apple is doing more harm than good by telling MacBook users to rely on it for cybersecurity. Rankin says that if MacBook owners follow Apple’s advisory, they will lose control over their security.</p><p>“The fundamental flaw with Apple’s approach is that it takes all control over security and privacy away from you. To be secure you must fully trust Apple and their security measures and if anything ever happens to violate that trust, such as a security exploit, there isn’t much you can do about it,” Rankin adds.</p><p>Rankin says that Purism believes in totally opposite concept for providing security to users. While Purism offers users <strong>Kill Switches</strong> to kill their microphone, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, webcam, etc. and be in control, Apple wants to be the sole security custodian for such services. “Apple and Purism take completely different approaches to security. Apple’s approach is to require customers to hand over all trust and control to Apple and depend upon Apple for all of their security. Purism’s approach is to give customers control over their own computers and provide security without depending upon Purism. Webcam security is a great lens through which to view these completely opposite approaches,” Rankin adds, “In the end, your privacy and your computer should belong to you, not the vendor that sold it.”</p><p>Purism is a Linux hardware maker and sells Linux smartphones, tablets, and laptops under the Librem brand. All Librem devices are designed to protect privacy and freedom by avoiding the Intel Active Management Technology. All Librem laptops feature hardware kill switches for the microphone, webcam, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><tr><td>
	<div>
	<p>It's worth discussing <em>how</em> all this works so you understand the 
	challenges that are being overcome here. The ability to run multiple DOS 
	programs at once is a pretty neat trick, given that this software heralds 
	from an era of computing that was <em>just barely</em> ahead of what the 
	Apple ][ was doing in 1978. If you want to skip this, <a href="#Windows_1.0">go ahead</a>.</p>
	<p>The root of the problem is that the IBM PCs basic architecture 
	crystallized a very long time ago, in 1981. In a world where ten kilobytes of RAM counted for 
	about what a gig does now, there was not a lot of room for "overhead" and 
	the idea that you would run two programs simultaneously was generally 
	unrealistic except at the high end of the computing world, which most PC 
	buyers were nowhere near. You needed every bit (<em>ha</em>) of memory you could get, and when 
	memory became more affordable a few years later, it was too late 
	to change anything.</p>
	<p>After just a couple years on the market, MS-DOS had become the 
	unquestioned OS of choice for the PC<a href="#footnote1">*</a> 
	and developed a monumental stable of software, every bit of which<em> </em>
	was essential to someone, somewhere, and could not be easily replaced. Thus 
	began one of the longest tails in technology history, as the PC industry and 
	Microsoft began contorting themselves to try not to 
	break compatibility with old software while still moving forward with advanced 
	functionality.<br>
	<sub><a name="footnote1">*</a>(specifically, since there were MS-DOSes for 
	other architectures, and other OSes for the PC)</sub></p>
	<p>Because DOS was developed under constraints very similar to those 
	in the 
	late '70s that gave us the "bitty boxes" (C64, Apple ][, ZX 
	Spectrum, etc.) it was not built with any kind of "supervision" in mind. In 
	other words, there was no abstraction level above the current running program. 
	DOS was more like a set of tools than what we think 
	of as an operating system now - specifically, it had no "process management"; no concept of "processes" at all, in fact.</p>
	<h2><strong>DOS</strong></h2>
	<p>When the machine booted, the part of DOS that was considered "the OS" - 
	the code for accessing disk drives, writing text to screen, etc. - was copied 
	into memory, and then execution was handed off to the command interpreter, COMMAND.COM, 
	which was an application like any other, at which point you could begin 
	entering commands to use the computer.</p>
		<p>At this point, DOS was no longer "running" in 
	any meaningful way. The code was "resident," meaning it was present in the 
		computer's memory, but 
	the processor wasn't&nbsp; executing any of it. Instead, the CPU was busy executing 
	whatever the current program was - if you were at the command prompt, then 
		all the code the PC was executing was part of COMMAND.COM. When you launched another application, COMMAND.COM was 
	vacated and replaced by that other application.</p>
	<p>In other words, while an application was running, DOS was almost totally out of 
	the picture. The only time execution returned to DOS itself was when the 
	application requested a "service" from DOS, like accessing a disk drive, at 
	which point it would tell the CPU to go execute one of DOS' stored routines 
	for this, and when that routine was done, control would return to the 
	application. This meant that,<em> generally speaking</em>,<em> </em>the current 
	program 
	had absolute control of the PCs execution and it's memory. It could in fact choose to 
	overwrite DOS itself, obliterating it out of memory, and DOS couldn't do a damn thing about it.</p>
	<p>The currently running app also had the option to speak directly to hardware. 
	The 
	whole purpose of DOS was to abstract things like that so programs wouldn't 
	need to know the details of the system they were running on, but since the 
	IBM PC was <em>extremely</em> consistent hardware-wise in its early 
	incarnations, it was entirely 
	optional for developers to take advantage of that, and often 
	there were reasons - of performance, perhaps - to bypass DOS and do things 
	directly.</p>
		<p>DOS provided disk access routines, 
	but the app could blow right by them and shoot commands straight to the 
	floppy drive if it wanted. DOS provided routines for printing text and clearing the 
	screen, but the app could just write directly to video memory. I can't speak to how common this kind of behavior actually was, but it 
	certainly wasn't rare, and it speaks to a larger problem - DOS apps simply 
	expect total control over the system.</p>
		<p>If you run two DOS apps at once, they're 
	going to stomp on each other, because each one thinks it's in charge of the 
		whole machine. The first one would store data in the same spot that the 
		second one stored program code, and thus one would overwrite the other 
		and crash it. So DOS was a single-tasking operating system - you could 
		run one program at a time, and when you wanted to run another, you had 
		to exit, return to the command prompt, and then launch your other app.</p>
		<p>Consequently, if you were working on something 
	in Microsoft Multiplan and wanted to go look up some data in dBase, you had to quit completely 
	out of Multiplan and then start dBase, which would take over the system and totally 
	overwrite the previous app. To get back to where you were you'd have to exit 
		dBase, restart Multiplan, load your document and find your place again - 
		in the process, totally forgetting what you were there to do in the 
		first place, because it's so many steps and takes so long.</p>
	<p>Right from the get-go, PC users wanted to be able to look at one program, then rapidly 
	switch to another. On its face this seems to mean "run two programs at once," 
	which is what we do now, but that's not quite the full story. Let's touch on how 
	that works nowadays, however.</p>
	<h2><strong>Multiprocessing</strong></h2>
	<p>To be clear, you <em>cannot</em> run two programs "at once" on a 
	computer. Some would call this semantics, but it's important in a very real 
	way, <em>especially</em> when talking about 80s-era PCs.</p>
		<p>Modern multicore CPUs get very close to true parallel processing by 
		letting separate programs run on separate cores, but of course, nobody has a CPU so big 
	that they have one core per process. And even if you did, programs still 
		have to share other 
	resources - the system bus, hard drives, and so on. Access to these 
	resources has to be carefully managed so that only one application can use 
		them at a time, and each one has to be cleaned up after before another 
		one can use the same resources. Otherwise, one program could leave the 
		hardware in a state where the commands that the next program sends put 
		it in an unusable state and crash the machine, or corrupt data.</p>
	<p>Even with all our modern pipelined cleverness, you have the 
	fundamental problem that a CPU, and a computer in general, has a limited 
	amount of physical hardware and can't dedicate some to each individual 
	program that's running. When you have more processes running than you have silicon, the only option left is to share 
	resources by dividing up the amount of time that each process gets to use the hardware 
	- this is one of the oldest concepts in computing, and goes back to the late '50s.</p>
	<p>The fundamentals of this process are simple: At 
	any given moment, one program has near-total control of the entire 
	system, to execute its code and use all the resources, and then after it 
	executes for a bit, it goes into a paused state and control is handed off to 
	the next program, which does its work and then hands off to the next. This 
	continues in a round-robin fashion, so that every program gets to use the 
	hardware for a certain portion of every second.</p>
	<p>Modern implementations take this to a fever pitch with all the complex 
	machinations used to make this process efficient, but the fundamentals have 
	never changed; this is how your PC is operating right now.</p>
	<p>One big hurdle to overcome in implementing this is that programs don't just execute 
	instructions in a vacuum. As code is executed, there are side 
	effects. Some are values internal to the CPU, like the&nbsp; status of CPU registers and the current 
	position of the instruction pointer. This is called "CPU state," amd is specific to 
	each running program. When you switch from one program to another, you have to 
	save that information - called "context switching" - and restore it when you 
	come back. Storing this info takes extra time and memory.</p>
		<p>Another hurdle is the state of other hardware. If two programs are 
		talking to the hard drive, you can't let them both just blindly issue 
		commands every time they get control of the CPU. The first process might 
		start a data read that the second process interrupts with a data write, 
		confusing the hard drive controller. So when switching from one process 
		to another, you also have to save the state of these other hardware 
		resources - and possibly even delay switching tasks until those hardware 
		requests are complete.</p>
	<p>If you have enough RAM to store this state, and if your apps don't need too many cycles per second to appear responsive, you can do all this and the user 
	will feel like they're "running multiple programs at 
	once."</p>
	<p>Now, in business applications - the 
	driving force behind the first couple decades of computing - actual 
	"multiprocessing" of this type is not as important as simple usability - users 
	just don't want to have to close one program in order to open another, as they 
	did throughout the DOS days. That, ultimately, is the goal: it 
	doesn't matter if the computer is perfectly speedy, or if programs can run 
	simultaneously, it just matters that 
	users not have to lose all their work in one program simply in order to look 
	at another.</p>
	<h2>Multitasking</h2>
	<p>This desire was of course tremendous right from the start of computing. Who wants to 
	be stuck in one program at a time? So, almost from the 
	earliest days of the IBM PC, software was created to enable task switching 
	with various degrees of success.</p>

<p>Whenever you’re learning a new tool, you should first ask yourself two questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Why does this tool exist?</li>
<li>What problems does this tool solve?</li>
</ol>
<p>If you can’t answer both of those questions, you may not need the tool in the first place. Let’s take those questions and apply them to webpack.</p>
<h3>Why does Webpack exist?</h3>
<p>At its core, webpack is a module bundler. It examines all of the <a href="https://ui.dev/javascript-modules-iifes-commonjs-esmodules/">modules</a> in your application, creates a dependency graph, then intelligently puts all of them together into one or more bundle(s) that your <code>index.html</code> file can reference.</p>
<div data-language="md"><pre><code>App.js ---&gt;     |         |
Dashboard.js -&gt; | Bundler | -&gt; bundle.js
About.js ---&gt;   |         |</code></pre></div>
<h3>What problem is webpack solving?</h3>
<p>Historically when building a JavaScript application, your JavaScript code would be separated by files (these files may or may not have been actual modules). Then in your <code>index.html</code> file, you’d have to include <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags to every JavaScript file you had.</p>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>body</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

  ...

  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min.js<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>libs/react.min.js<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>'</span>src/admin.js<span>'</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>'</span>src/dashboard.js<span>'</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>'</span>src/api.js<span>'</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>'</span>src/auth.js<span>'</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>'</span>src/rickastley.js<span>'</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>body</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Not only was this tedious, but it was also error-prone. There were the obvious issues like typos or forgetting to include a file, but more than that, the order of the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags mattered. If you loaded a script that depended on React before loading the React script, things would break. Because webpack (intelligently) creates a bundle for you, both of those problems go away. You don’t have to worry about forgetting a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> and you don’t have to worry about the order.</p>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>body</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

  ...

  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>'</span>dist/bundle.js<span>'</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>body</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>As we’ll soon see, the “module bundling” aspect is just one part of webpack. If needed, you’re also able to tell webpack to make certain transformations on your modules before adding them to the bundle. Examples might include transforming SASS/LESS to regular CSS or “modern JavaScript” to ES5 that the browser can understand.</p>
<h3>Installing webpack</h3>
<p>Assuming you’ve initialized a new project with npm, there are two packages you need to install to use webpack, <code>webpack</code> and <code>webpack-cli</code>.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>npm</span> <span>install</span> webpack webpack-cli --save-dev</code></pre></div>
<h3>webpack.config.js</h3>
<p>Once you’ve installed <code>webpack</code> and <code>webpack-cli</code>, it’s time to start configuring webpack. To do that, you’ll create a <code>webpack.config.js</code> file that exports an object. Naturally, this object is where all the configuration settings for webpack will go.</p>

<p>Remember, the whole point of webpack is to “examine all of your modules, (optionally) transform them, then intelligently put all of them together into one or more bundle(s)” If you think about that process, in order to do that, webpack needs to know three things.</p>
<ol>
<li>The entry point of your application</li>
<li>Which transformations, if any, to make on your code</li>
<li>The location to put the newly formed bundle(s)</li>
</ol>
<h4>The entry point</h4>
<p>Whenever your application is composed of modules, there’s always a single module that is the entry point of your application. It’s the module that kicks everything off. Typically, it’s an <code>index.js</code> file. Something like this.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>index<span>.</span>js
  imports about<span>.</span>js
  imports dashboard<span>.</span>js
    imports graph<span>.</span>js
    imports auth<span>.</span>js
      imports api<span>.</span>js</code></pre></div>
<p>If we give webpack the path to this entry file, it’ll use that to create the dependency graph of our application (much like we did above, except… better). To do that, you add an <code>entry</code> property to your webpack config which points to your entry file.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  entry<span>:</span> <span>'./app/index.js'</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h4>Transformations with Loaders</h4>
<p>Now that webpack knows the entry file, the next thing we need to tell it is what transformations to run on our code. To do this, we’ll use what are called “loaders”.</p>
<p>Out of the box, when webpack is building its dependency graph by examining all of your <code>import</code>/<code>require()</code> statements, it’s only able to process JavaScript and JSON files.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>import</span> auth <span>from</span> <span>'./api/auth'</span> 
<span>import</span> config <span>from</span> <span>'./utils/config.json'</span> 
<span>import</span> <span>'./styles.css'</span> 
<span>import</span> logo <span>from</span> <span>'./assets/logo.svg'</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>There’s a very good chance that you’re going to want your dependency tree to be made up of more than just JS and JSON files - i.e., you’re going to want to be able to import <code>.css</code> files, <code>.svg</code> files, images, etc, as we’re doing above. This is where “loaders” can help us out. The primary purpose of a loader, as the name suggests, is to give webpack the ability to process more than just JavaScript and JSON files.</p>
<p>The first step to adding any loader is to download it. Because we want to add the ability to <code>import</code> <code>.svg</code> files in our app, we’ll download the <code>svg-inline-loader</code> from npm.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>npm</span> <span>install</span> svg-inline-loader --save-dev</code></pre></div>
<p>Next, we need to add it to our webpack config. All of the information for your loaders will go into an array of objects under <code>module.rules</code>.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  entry<span>:</span> <span>'./app/index.js'</span><span>,</span>
  module<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    rules<span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now there are two pieces of information we need to give webpack about each loader. First, the type of file we want to run the loader on (in our case, all <code>.svg</code> files). Second, the loader to use on that file type (in our case, <code>svg-inline-loader</code>).</p>
<p>To do this, we’ll have an object with two properties, <code>test</code> and <code>use</code>. <code>test</code> will be a regex to match the file path and <code>use</code> will be the name of the loader we want to use.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  entry<span>:</span> <span>'./app/index.js'</span><span>,</span>
  module<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    rules<span>:</span> <span>[</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.svg$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>'svg-inline-loader'</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>]</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now anywhere in our app, we’ll be able to import <code>.svg</code> files. What about our <code>.css</code> files though? Let’s add a loader for that as well. We’ll use the <code>css-loader</code>.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>npm</span> <span>install</span> css-loader --save-dev</code></pre></div>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  entry<span>:</span> <span>'./app/index.js'</span><span>,</span>
  module<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    rules<span>:</span> <span>[</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.svg$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>'svg-inline-loader'</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.css$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>'css-loader'</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>]</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now anywhere in our app, we can import <code>.svg</code> and <code>.css</code> files. However, there’s still one more loader we need to add to get our styles to work properly. Right now, because of our <code>css-loader</code>, we’re able to <code>import</code> <code>.css</code> files. However, that doesn’t mean those styles are being injected into the DOM. What we really want to do is <code>import</code> a CSS file then have webpack put all of that CSS in a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag in the DOM so they’re active on the page. To do that, we’ll use the <code>style-loader</code>.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>npm</span> <span>install</span> style-loader --save-dev</code></pre></div>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  entry<span>:</span> <span>'./app/index.js'</span><span>,</span>
  module<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    rules<span>:</span> <span>[</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.svg$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>'svg-inline-loader'</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.css$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>[</span> <span>'style-loader'</span><span>,</span> <span>'css-loader'</span> <span>]</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>]</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Notice, because we now have two loaders for our <code>.css</code> rule, we change <code>use</code> to be an array. Also, notice that we have <code>style-loader</code> before <code>css-loader</code>. This is important. Webpack will process those in reverse order. So <code>css-loader</code> will interpret the <code>import './styles.css'</code> line then <code>style-loader</code> will inject that CSS into the DOM.</p>
<hr>
<p>As we just saw with <code>style-loader</code>, loaders can do more than just allow you to <code>import</code> certain file types. They’re also able to run transformations on files before they get added to the final output bundle. The most popular is transforming “next generation JavaScript” to the JavaScript of today that browsers can understand using <a href="https://babeljs.io/" rel="nofollow">Babel</a>. To do this, you can use the <code>babel-loader</code> on every <code>.js</code> file.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>npm</span> <span>install</span> babel-loader --save-dev</code></pre></div>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  entry<span>:</span> <span>'./app/index.js'</span><span>,</span>
  module<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    rules<span>:</span> <span>[</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.svg$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>'svg-inline-loader'</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.css$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>[</span> <span>'style-loader'</span><span>,</span> <span>'css-loader'</span> <span>]</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.(js)$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>'babel-loader'</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>]</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<hr>
<p>There are loaders for just about anything you’d need to do. You can check out the <a href="https://webpack.js.org/loaders/" rel="nofollow">full list here</a>.</p>
<h4>The output</h4>
<p>Now that webpack knows the entry file and what loaders to use, the next thing we need to tell it is where to put the bundle it creates. To do this, you add an <code>output</code> property to your webpack config.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>

<span>const</span> path <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'path'</span><span>)</span>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>

    filename<span>:</span> <span>'index_bundle.js'</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So the full process looks something like this.</p>
<ol>
<li>webpack grabs the entry point located at <code>./app/index.js</code>.</li>
<li>It examines all of our <code>import</code> and <code>require</code> statements and creates a dependency graph.</li>
<li>webpack starts creating a bundle, whenever it comes across a path we have a loader for, it transforms the code according to that loader then adds it to the bundle.</li>
<li>It takes the final bundle and outputs it at <code>dist/index_bundle.js</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Plugins</h3>
<p>We’ve seen how you can use loaders to work on individual files before or while the bundle is being generated. Unlike loaders, plugins allow you to execute certain tasks <strong>after</strong> the bundle has been created. Because of this, these tasks can be on the bundle itself, or just to your codebase. You can think of plugins as a more powerful, less restrictive version of loaders.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at a few examples.</p>
<h4>HtmlWebpackPlugin</h4>
<p>Earlier we saw that the main benefit of webpack was that it would generate a single bundle for us that we could then use to reference inside of our main <code>index.html</code> page.</p>
<p>What <code>HtmlWebpackPlugin</code> does is it will generate this <code>index.html</code> page for us, stick it inside of the same directory where our bundle is put, and automatically include a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag which references the newly generated bundle.</p>
<p>So in our example, because we’ve told webpack to name the final bundle <code>index_bundle.js</code> and put it in a folder called <code>dist</code>, when <code>HtmlWebpackPlugin</code> runs, it’ll create a new <code>index.html</code> file, put it in <code>dist</code>, and include a script to reference the bundle, <code>&lt;script src='bundle_index.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>. Pretty nice, right? Because this file is being generated for us by <code>HtmlWebpackPlugin</code>, even if we change the output path or …</p></div></div>

I’ve laid out the index of topics covered in the post. </p><p>Depending on the stage of your journey, feel free to skip to the sections that are most relevant to you.<br></p><h3><strong>Topics covered in this post</strong></h3><ol role="list"><li>Why choose Shopify for your first micro-SaaS (and why you shouldn't)</li><li>Discover problems, niches, and Shopify app ideas</li><li>Standing out from competition</li><li>Shopify App Store optimisation basics</li><li>Find your #1 keyword</li><li>Getting customers to review your Shopify app (by delivering great customer support)</li><li>Getting the first customers for your Shopify app</li><li>Finding early users and beta testers for your Shopify app outside the App Store</li><li>Getting listed under the right categories &amp; collections, and getting featured on the Shopify App Store</li><li>The right pricing model for your Shopify app</li><li>Optimising for trials</li><li>Long term game plan in the Shopify App Store</li></ol><p>‍<br></p><h2><strong>Why choose Shopify for your first micro-SaaS (and why you shouldn't)</strong></h2><p>Shopify isn’t the only choice when it comes to picking an apps marketplace. There’s </p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://slack.com/apps" target="_blank">Slack</a></li><li><a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/" target="_blank">Atlassian</a></li><li><a href="https://appexchange.salesforce.com/" target="_blank">Salesforce</a></li><li><a href="https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace" target="_blank">GSuite Marketplace</a></li><li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions" target="_blank">Chrome Web Store</a></li><li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a></li><li><a href="https://www.apple.com/in/ios/app-store/" target="_blank">Apple iOS App Store</a></li><li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/genre/mac/id39?mt=12" target="_blank">Mac App Store</a></li></ul><p>All these marketplaces are valid options for you to start. I would lean on a marketplace where there’s a combination of 2 factors</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Familiarity with problems</strong> - You know what the core product is about, you understand or can empathise with its users maybe from using the tool at your previous workplace, you have an idea on the different kind of problems that exist in the ecosystem and don’t find it too boring to solve them</li><li><strong>Skillset to execute</strong> - If you don’t know how to build Android, iOS, or Mac apps, perhaps steer clear of it. Your goal is not to take on a hard challenge, it’s to take on a challenge where you have some advantage from skill and insight. The goal is to win.<br></li></ol><h3>Why you should pick the Shopify app marketplace:</h3><ul role="list"><li><strong>Huge distribution:</strong> Marketing is often a big reason for a business’s failure, the App Store takes care of it. Shopify has 1mn+ merchants and tons of new signups every month who go to the app store browsing for solutions. <br>Shopify promotes apps within its product and has made it an integral part of its user journey. A new app is able to gain traction fairly easily in the app marketplace, which makes it friendly to newcomers. <br>Marketing is often a big reason for a business’s failure, the App Store takes care of it.</li><li><strong>Tons of app opportunities:</strong> E-commerce store owners have 101+ problems to be taken care of, and you can address any one and do a great job at it to build a sustainable business. It’s not hard (relative standards) to gain 200 paying customers paying you $10/mo to earn $2000/mo ($1600 after Shopify’s 20%)</li><li><strong>Ease of development:</strong> Shopify’s documentation and APIs are first-class, they get out of the way allowing you to build fast. Additionally, Shopify’s <a href="https://polaris.shopify.com/" target="_blank">Polaris UI framework</a> makes building app interfaces a piece of cake. It’s based on React and comes with a Sketch/Figma file to help you design and prototype solutions fast.</li><li><strong>Billing taken care of:</strong> Heads up, Shopify takes a 20% commission on all earnings. So if your app’s monthly subscription fees is $10, you get $8. In return, Shopify takes care of billing end to end.<br>You can charge monthly, annually, charge per activity, provide app credit, and issue refunds with very little effort. You don’t need to worry about failed payments, Shopify takes care of it. You don’t even need to generate an invoice, app bills are included in the merchant’s monthly Shopify invoice.</li><li><strong>Familiarity with ecommerce:</strong> If you’re someone who can jump into an industry and learn all about it, great. If not, you would want some familiarity with how an ecommerce store works, what are the typical problems faced by a merchant.<br>You can do this by creating a Shopify store and trying to sell your own products. Or you could have conversations with 10 different store owners and absorb from their experience. You could also find someone who works at an e-commerce agency for valuable insights. It’s not that hard.<br></li></ul><h3>Why you shouldn’t pick the Shopify app marketplace:</h3><ul role="list"><li><strong>Copycat galore:</strong> You’re likely to copy an existing app and make a slight improvement in terms of product, pricing, or both. Guess what, the next smart person with the same idea can do the same to you. If you’re dependent on getting all or majority of your customers from the app store, be ready for stiff competition from copycats. <br>This doesn’t mean you cannot grow your app to $1k or $10k MRR. SaaS is not a winner take all market. It just means that it gets harder to grow as you grow. If this is something you are not mentally prepared for, steer clear. <br>There’s ways you can grow out of this by taking a long term strategy, either by taking a brand-centric approach (brand is not your name, but the experience that customers remember you by for which they’ll choose you over a copycat). <br>Or you can go upmarket and target large volume and Plus merchants, where ticket sizes are $200/mo or higher and switching does not happen often. </li><li><strong>Low-end, high-maintenance customers:</strong> Majority of Shopify merchants are people who don’t want to pay beyond $10-$15/mo and yet they expect world-class customer service. Some will ask for phone support or to jump on a video call. <br>You can tackle this by solving problems where the ticket sizes are higher, in the range of $50-$100/mo, but also expect it to be significantly harder to rank and fight existing competitors in such problem spaces. Example - <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/search?q=page+builder" target="_blank">page builders</a>, <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/search?q=product+reviews" target="_blank">product review</a> apps. <br>You can mitigate this by going in with the mindset that you’ll be serving $15/mo customers, so your app better be self-serve ready, have a dead simple UX and sufficient documentation or walkthrough videos. You can also aim to be the cost-leader of a segment, example - <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/judgeme" target="_blank">Judge.me</a> </li></ul><p>‍<br></p><h2><strong>Discover problems, niches, and Shopify app ideas</strong></h2><p>I’ve previously written about <a href="https://www.preetamnath.com/blog/shopify-micro-saas-growth" target="_blank">uncovering opportunities on Shopify</a> and I also shared all my research in my big <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hnpcl1VAlPC9MuFvvsl2UsU0yu1iM6aKR-iK30VtbwA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Shopify app ideas spreadsheet</a>. Let me reiterate on the advice shared there in a more structured manner that will hopefully better answer questions like:</p><ul role="list"><li>“How do you find niches in the app store in the first place?”</li><li>“How to find a problem worth solving within shopify? (worth solving=stressful enough for merchants &amp; competition not too tough)”<br></li></ul><p>There have been people who have asked me what kind of problems to solve, or what are the underserved niches. The thing is - if there's an obviously underserved niche and people have taken the time to research about it, they are probably busy solving it. If it's being posted in any blog post, know that it's no longer an underserved or hidden niche, because clearly anyone could find it.</p><p>Ultimately, only you can find an idea that you find worthy enough to pursue, whose various pros and cons are justified in your mind. And therefore, I can only provide a directional framework towards evaluating ideas. I can't list out ideas.</p><p>The best use of a directional framework is to</p><ol start="" role="list"><li><strong>First</strong> - cast a wide net, get to know what's out there</li><li><strong>Second</strong> - narrow down your search based on parameters you have decided</li></ol><p>This first section of the article will help you with casting a wide net. </p><p>As you go further along the article, I've shared ideas and techniques which you can use to narrow down your search.<br></p><h3>1- Browse the entire App Store</h3><p>I recommend this as the starting point for anyone new to the Shopify ecosystem. Start by browsing all the categories &amp; sub-categories of apps on the app store. You can do the same on <a href="https://sasi.unionworks.co.uk/categories" target="_blank">SASI</a>. </p><p>The purpose of browsing this way is to familiarise yourself with the different types of problems faced by merchants and being solved by apps. Ideally, you want to note down some interesting apps that you come across during your browsing adventure to investigate later on.</p><figure id="w-node-892fc283544a-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f1c114edd643e073591f8cc_browse%20categories%20shopify%20app%20store.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>2- Go through every letter in search autocomplete</h3><p>Okay, this is a step I took when&nbsp;I was browsing the app store. I would type in "aa", "ab", "ac"... ... ... "zz" on the search bar, note the autocomplete terms and check the results of ones I found to be interesting.</p><p>Turns out, Shopify has since updated their algorithm. Autocomplete suggestions only show up after you type 3 letters now. So you can't recreate what I did with autocomplete and go through every letter. It's not feasible anymore.</p><p>Not to worry, it's still useful.</p><h4>Plug in keywords of shortlisted apps into the search bar</h4><p>From step 1, all the apps (hopefully at least a dozen) that you shortlisted for being interesting, extract the keywords used in the app's title or description. </p><p>Now, enter …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Around November of last year, I started a project to wrangle my digital life. Tired of haphazardly increasing my subjectivity by trusting "free" websites to provide various services, I wanted to wrest some control over my internet existence. I made a plan to self-host several "critical" services on my home network and maintain them personally. In short, I made a homelab.</p>
<p>To be frank, the professional websites that I was previously dependent upon are undoubtedly more reliable than my cobbled-together hobby project of a homelab. However, on general principle (and because it seemed like a fun way to learn some sysadmin / devops skills), I made this setup:</p>
<p><img src="https://0xc45.com/blog/ansible-defined-homelab/homelab-network-diagram.svg" alt="Homelab Network Diagram"></p>
<p>As you can see, I have deployed a couple of general-purpose compute platforms: 4 ESXi hypervisors, and a Kubernetes cluster. Additionally, there are several VM-based services: Nextcloud, Gitea, and Harbor. For data storage and backup, I use a Synology NAS. Finally, a custom OpenBSD-based router provides internet connectivity to everything. In order to reduce operational overhead, I crafted <a href="https://github.com/0xC45/homelab-setup">a set of Ansible scripts</a> that deploy and configure all of these components.</p>
<p>Overall, making this setup has been quite a journey. In this blog post, I will describe my uses for each of these services, share my thoughts and experiences so far, and attempt to articulate my future improvement plans.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Of course, everything you see above already exists as a service on the internet. If my goal were solely the end feature set, it would have been much simpler to pay for each service. In most cases, there are even "free" versions available. For example, if I only cared about having access to a web-based git repository UI, I could have signed up for a Github or Gitlab account rather than bother setting up a Gitea VM on my home network.</p>
<p>However, like most of my hobby projects, this endeavor was more about the journey than the destination. By setting up these services on my home network, I learned a bunch of useful devops and sysadmin skills. Additionally, by running my own services, I have achieved the philosophical goal of reducing my reliance on 3rd party services. Now, if any of the services that I rely upon break, I am empowered to fix them. I am no longer dependent on the "opaque box" that is Google Drive, for example.</p>
<h2 id="components">Components</h2>
<p>So, without further ado, let's dive into each of the components that make up my homelab. For each component, I will describe the main utility it provides me, why I chose it, and any additional commentary that may be helpful.</p>
<h3 id="router">Router</h3>
<p>The first component of my homelab is a custom OpenBSD-based router. It provides internet connectivity and DHCP to everything on my home network. Additionally, the device serves as a caching DNS server and firewall. I could write an entire blog post describing this router in excruciating detail. In fact, I <a href="https://0xc45.com/blog/openbsd-home-router/">already have</a>.</p>
<h3 id="esxi-hosts">ESXi Hosts</h3>
<p>In total, I maintain four physical <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/esxi-and-esx.html">ESXi</a> hosts to form a platform for running virtual machines on my network.</p>
<p>Three of the ESXi hosts are Intel NUCs (System76 Meerkats). These smaller machines run the VMs that form my Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<p>The other ESXi host is a custom machine built from spare parts. It currently runs three VM-based HTTPS services: Nextcloud, Gitea, and Harbor. Because it only runs three (relatively small) VMs, it has quite a bit of spare compute power leftover for future additions and/or temporary experiments.</p>
<p>I chose ESXi to run my virtual machines because it's enterprise quality and free. There are many hypervisors out there. For my current use case, ESXi is perfect. Also, in the future, I may consider expanding my use of VMware products by running vCenter to programmatically manage virtual machines, setting-up vSAN for shared storage, and potentially installing NSX if my networking requirements become more complicated. So, there is room to grow.</p>
<h3 id="kubernetes-cluster">Kubernetes Cluster</h3>
<p>In addition to the VM-based compute platform provided by ESXi, I run Kubernetes to provide a container-based compute platform. Though I do not currently use my Kubernetes cluster for anything, I have plans to setup <a href="https://argoproj.github.io/">Argo CI/CD</a>, experiment with <a href="https://knative.dev/">kNative</a>, develop some operators, and maybe run a <a href="https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/factorio">factorio game server</a>.</p>
<p>The Kubernetes cluster consists of 6 VMs running across 3 Intel NUCs. I chose to install Kubernetes on VMs with the ESXi hypervisor layer for ease of management. At some point, I'm sure to break things, want to reconfigure, etc. With the hypervisor, it's easier to perform these type of adjustments. Furthermore, at some point in the future, I may switch to <a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/kubernetes-grid">TKG</a>, a vSphere-integrated distribution of Kubernetes.</p>
<h3 id="synology-nas">Synology NAS</h3>
<p>For backups and storing important data, I use a <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-global/products/DS218+">Synology NAS</a>. Though I didn't really shop around and compare NAS products / vendors, I am happy with the Synology so far. That being said, I would like to create my own NAS from scratch at some point in the future. However, the Synology product includes several features "out-of-the-box" that would be potentially difficult to replicate.</p>
<p>First, it has an easy-to-use application called <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/dsm/feature/active_backup_business">"Active Backup for Business"</a> that can automatically take backups of ESXi virtual machines following configurable schedules and retention policies.</p>
<p>The VM backup application pairs nicely with the automatic cloud backup application, <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/dsm/packages/GlacierBackup">"Glacier Backup"</a>. Every night, after the VMs are backed-up to the NAS, I replicate the backups to Amazon S3 Glacier. Hopefully, this way I won't ever lose data.</p>
<p>Finally, the Synology has built-in UPS integration. If <a href="https://www.apc.com/shop/us/en/products/APC-Power-Saving-Back-UPS-Pro-1500/P-BR1500G">my UPS</a> loses power for more than one minute, the NAS will cleanly shutdown, preventing any data corruption that could be caused by an unexpected power loss.</p>
<h3 id="nextcloud-vm">Nextcloud VM</h3>
<p>I use <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a> as my "personal cloud". I use it to store my important files and photos. The desktop / mobile application synchronizes the files across all of my devices, allowing me to edit and view my files from anywhere. </p>
<p>Nextcloud also has the capability to install "apps" that provide additional functionality. Currently, I have only installed one app, <a href="https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/deck">"Deck"</a>. Deck is a Kanban-style project management and organization tool. I use Deck to plan, organize, and record progress on my hobby projects.</p>
<p>Because it gives me the capability to install (and potentially create) apps, Nextcloud is an extensible platform. It's open source and under active development. Though the recent major version upgrade was a bit rocky (for me, at least), I'm happy with Nextcloud and plan to stick with it.</p>
<h3 id="gitea-vm">Gitea VM</h3>
<p>Of course, I need a place to store my code. For that purpose, I use <a href="https://gitea.io/en-us/">Gitea</a>. I prefer Gitea to Gitlab because it's lighter-weight. Unlike Gitlab, there aren't a million additional features bundled-in that add bloat (in my opinion). Also, I slightly prefer the Gitea UI over the Gitlab UI.</p>
<p>There's really not much else to say about Gitea. It works great for my purposes. I push all of my code to the Gitea VM running on my home network. Whenever I want to "publish" a project or share it with the world, I push my code to a public Github repo.</p>
<h3 id="harbor-vm">Harbor VM</h3>
<p>To make container images available for running on my Kubernetes cluster, I need a container registry. For this purpose, I use <a href="https://goharbor.io/">Harbor</a>, an open source solution that seems to be the current most popular self-hosted container registry. In addition to providing a standard API for pushing/pulling container images, Harbor has the useful capability to scan container images for known vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Harbor has worked well for me so far, but I haven't really placed it under a serious workload. Soon, I will start using my Kubernetes cluster for various projects, which will require pushing / pulling images from Harbor on a regular basis. Perhaps, at some point in the future, I will have a more nuanced opinion of Harbor.</p>
<h2 id="future-improvements">Future Improvements</h2>
<p>Though I am happy with the current setup, I continually find myself coming up with ideas for potential improvements and additions to the homelab. Here are a couple of the more well-defined ideas.</p>
<p>First, I want to install <a href="https://argoproj.github.io/">Argo</a> on the Kubernetes cluster to run pipeline-based workflows. For example, it could be useful to automatically run tests for every commit that gets pushed to my repositories on Gitea. More generally, I could configure Argo to trigger a job for any arbitrary external event. It could be used to create a notification service. Or, it could be used to manage heavy workloads. There are endless potential uses for a pipeline-based workflow engine such as Argo.</p>
<p>Second, I want to create a dashboard that provides a graphical representation of the status of each of my homelab components using <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a>. Using various open-source tools, I could collect metrics and aggregate them. Then, using Grafana, I could visualize the data. It would be useful to be able to quickly ascertain the state of my home network services in order to understand workloads, diagnose issues, etc.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>With the work spanning several months, creating my homelab has been quite a journey. Along the way, I started to grow weary, concerned that I had signed myself up for the all-consuming task of operating my homelab. With the overhead required to maintain all the various components, how could I ever have time for anything else? However, I'm happy to report that the Ansible script automation has proved worthwhile. Now, upgrades, configuration changes, and various "day 2" operations are quick and simple. At this point, I'm looking forward to shifting gears and working on something else for a while, using my homelab services as helpful tools along the way.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><a href="https://sunburnt.com.au/huawei-hacked-my-laptop">Huawei Hacked My Laptop?</a></p><p><img alt="" src="https://sunburnt.com.au/ox/webcore/attachments/29436/20200725_180027.huawei-xhost.png?width=500&amp;height=444"></p>

<p>The screenshot above shows a script called "Huawei Autorun" which executes the command "xhost +" when you login. This command makes your Linux desktop remotely accessible to anyone on the network. The "Huawei Autorun" script appeared on my laptop after installing a Huawei E353 HSPA+ 3G USB stick (with serial number CE0682 on the back).</p>

<p>It seems like I dodged a bullet as I don't use the standard Linux GNOME desktop, so the script was not enabled, but the fact remains that Huawei installed malware on my Linux laptop. If they managed to get into my laptop, imagine what is happening inside your phone.</p>

<p>State-sponsored hacking is real.</p>

<p><strong>----UPDATE----</strong></p>

<p>For those people who requested more information. The OS is Debian 8.1 LTS. The script is basically a one-liner embedded in an autostart launcher (see below). It was installed as root, so I must have screwed up big time there. Obviously, I'll&nbsp;have to reinstall my OS.&nbsp;Debian 8 is at end of life&nbsp;now anyway.</p>

<pre>$ cat /etc/xdg/autostart/HuaweiAutoStart.desktop 
[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=Huawei  AutoRun
Name[en_US]=Huawei AutoRun
<strong>Exec=xhost +</strong>
SwallowExec=
SwallowTitle=
Terminal=false
TerminalOptions=
Type=Application
URL=
X-KDE-SubstituteUID=false
X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true
GenericName[en_US]=</pre>

<p><strong>----UPDATE 2----</strong></p>

<p>Okay, I decided to check out this modem. It does include Linux drivers which require root for installation. I reran the installation script as root and sure enough the same autostart script was reinstalled.</p>

<pre>$ ls /etc/xdg/autostart/ -l
total 116
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  305 Oct 10  2014 at-spi-dbus-bus.desktop
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 6351 Oct 21  2014 gnome-keyring-gpg.desktop
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 7777 Oct 21  2014 gnome-keyring-pkcs11.desktop
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 7339 Oct 21  2014 gnome-keyring-secrets.desktop
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 5996 Oct 21  2014 gnome-keyring-ssh.desktop
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 7741 Aug 27  2014 gsettings-data-convert.desktop
<strong>-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  262 Jul 25 23:59 HuaweiAutoStart.desktop</strong>
<span>....</span>
</pre>

<p>This script is also installed to <span>$HOME/.config/autostart/</span><span>HuaweiAutoStart.desktop</span>. Another script called <span>ReadDisplay</span> is&nbsp;installed in <span>/usr/local/modem</span> which&nbsp;passes the&nbsp;<span>$DISPLAY</span>&nbsp;environment variable to a binary&nbsp;called <span>MobilePartner</span>. The drivers do include a GUI, but if the sole purpose of all this is to fire up a GUI then it is not only exceptionally sloppy code, but also a&nbsp;security risk that needs explaining.</p>

<p>Below is a tarball image of the huawei e353 drivers so you can audit them for yourself. I've included the Windows drivers so you get an image of the disk just as I have it. Heck you could even try it for yourself. The drivers didn't compile the second time I did this, but the autostart script was still installed.</p>

<p><a href="https://sunburnt.com.au/ox/webcore/attachments/29437/huawei-e353-malware.tar.gz">Download huawei e353 drivers (warning, possible malware!)</a></p>

<p><strong>----UPDATE 3----</strong></p>

<p>I'm giving Huawei the benefit of doubt on this one. As a commenter suggested, it is probably a hack to run the GUI as root. Either way, it is still a nasty vulnerability, even if your X server is configured to use local sockets by default. I guess this&nbsp;shows the folly of blindly trusting hardware manufactures. I'll be sticking to open source code from official repositories in the future.</p>

<p>Live and learn, I suppose.</p>

      <p>Based on the article, I would think it is just a sloppy and lazy implementation, but the title does served as a bait clicker. The comment where avoiding pure chinese company or there is at least American company involved will be pure ignorance&nbsp;or turning a blind eye on what is happening around the world and purely cynical. Every country spying on people when they have the means and ways. So don't even think for a second that&nbsp;&nbsp;an American company involvement will make it any better. That will be pure ignorant.<br>
<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10403598/35-world-leaders-had-their-phones-monitored-by-US-spies.html">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10403598/35-world-leaders-had-their-phones-monitored-by-US-spies.html</a></p>

    
  <p>It's more likely the package installed some graphical configuration tool that needs to run as root. Running "xhost +" is a lazy way to enable programs running as root to connect to your non-root user's X11 session.</p>

<p>I don't know what debian's default settings are regarding Xorg and networking, but on my laptop Xorg appears to only be listening on unix sockets, which are obviously not accessible from the whole network.</p>

    
  <blockquote>
<p><span>State-sponsored hacking is real.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p><span>Yes. It's happening. 14 eyes (US+others) are also doing it. So I don't trust US services and devices either.</span></p>

<p><span>While they're banning each other of different things, open hardware is rising up and welcoming everyone (for example RISC V). We need things like this in this world to bring in peace so that they don't fight over silli things.</span></p>

    
  <p>Clean the system, you most likely found one piece of the drop. Replace the drive, looks to be a long weekend</p>

    
  <p>I avoid any pure Chinese tech, where possible. By law in China, all companies must work with the CCP (which means the military). Obviously, iPhones and such are made in China, although production is starting to move to other countries under Trump's trade policies, but at least there is an American company involved on the HW and SW sides.</p>

    
  <p>Did inserting the Huawei E353 dongle attach a virtual CD-ROM drive that you manually installed drivers from? I know for a fact similar devices (eg, ZTE MF910) offer drivers this way. The generic Linux USB ethernet driver worked fine, so there's no need to install Huawei or ZTE's driver.</p>

<p>It's worth mentioning USB On-The-Go devices (including Android phones and 4G modems) have relatively powerful processors running a wide variety of network services, including an insecure web server (for the end-user web configuration interface), high-precision location, a high bandwidth internet side-channel (the 4G connection itself) while also having the ability to act as any USB client device (including keyboards to send keystrokes). They are an incredibly powerful platform for targeted cyberattacks and I imagine state actors are using them very often.</p>

July 25, 2020 | https://dylanmeeus.github.io/posts/audio-from-scratch-pt4/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://dylanmeeus.github.io/posts/audio-from-scratch-pt4/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>In the <a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/posts/audio-from-scratch-pt3/">previous post</a> we have written code to change the amplitude of wave files.</p>
<p>Now we’ll take a look at how we can turn a mono wave file into a stereo wave file with an optional
panning, and explore how this is represented internally by the WAVE file format.</p>

<p>The raw audio data inside a WAVE file consists of multiple frames. For now, we have called them
‘samples’ although that is strictly speaking not entirely correct. In fact, single float in the raw
audio data only corresponds to a single sample when we assume a mono audio file.</p>
<p>When you have multiple channels, a single ‘sample’ can consist of multiple frames. As each channel
needs to play a certain ‘frame’ at any given point in time.</p>
<p>In the WAVE file format, the channels are interleaved. For example, a stereo file would be
laid out like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/audio/interleaving.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here, each sample consists of two frames. Such that frame 1 and 2 make up sample 1, frame 3 and 4
make up sample 2, and so on..</p>
<p>Programs know how to interpret the raw audio data because of the <code>fmt</code> chunk inside the audio file,
which specifies the number of channels that are present in the raw audio data. The maximum number of
channels in a wave file is actually as high as 65,536, which does not actually make sense for audio
data.</p>
<p>Some common ones would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>1-channel: mono</li>
<li>2-channel: stereo</li>
<li>3-channel: stereo + center channel</li>
<li>4-channel: Quadrophonic</li>
<li>5-channel: “Surround sound”</li>
</ul>
<p>For convenience though, we’ll mostly work on mono and stereo files. Not only are they the most
commonly used, this also allows us to test our code without needing a more expensive setup.</p>

<p>So what is a pan? When you pan an audio signal, you essentially make an audio signal ‘louder’ on
either the left or the right side. Typically in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation">DAW</a> this would be represented by an ‘automation
track’ between the value of -1 to 1.</p>
<p>The program to apply a pan will take three parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>input file</li>
<li>output file</li>
<li>pan (-1 to 1)</li>
</ul>
<p>For the input file we will restrict this to mono files, and for the output files we will always
generate a stereo file. The pan variable should be between -1 (left) and 1 (right). Before we can
start applying our pan, we need to read the raw audio data from an input wave file. Remember that to
read the wave file we will use the <a href="https://github.com/DylanMeeus/GoAudio">GoAudio</a> library we made
earlier:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>import</span> (
        <span>wav</span> <span>"github.com/DylanMeeus/GoAudio/wave"</span>
)
</code></pre></div><p>The set up for this program is rather simple, we will use the build-in <code>flags</code> package to parse the
input from the CLI.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>var</span> (
	<span>input</span>  = <span>flag</span>.<span>String</span>(<span>"i"</span>, <span>""</span>, <span>"input file"</span>)
	<span>output</span> = <span>flag</span>.<span>String</span>(<span>"o"</span>, <span>""</span>, <span>"output file"</span>)
	<span>pan</span>    = <span>flag</span>.<span>Float64</span>(<span>"p"</span>, <span>0.0</span>, <span>"pan in range of -1 (left) to 1 (right)"</span>)
)
</code></pre></div><p>Once we have our flags set up, we can parse them and read the input file.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
	<span>flag</span>.<span>Parse</span>()
	<span>infile</span> <span>:=</span> <span>*</span><span>input</span>
	<span>outfile</span> <span>:=</span> <span>*</span><span>output</span>
	<span>panfac</span> <span>:=</span> <span>*</span><span>pan</span>
	<span>wave</span>, <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>wav</span>.<span>ReadWaveFile</span>(<span>infile</span>)
	<span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> {
		panic(<span>"Could not parse wave file"</span>)
	}
        <span>...</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>So far so good. We have parsed the input so we know which value to use for our pan, and we have read
the raw audio data as well. But how do we go from a value in the range of (-1) to (1) to an actual
change in loudness on the left or right-side? We can imagine that a simple function would look like
this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>type</span> <span>panposition</span> <span>struct</span> {
	<span>left</span>, <span>right</span> <span>float64</span>
}

<span>func</span> <span>calculatePosition</span>(<span>position</span> <span>float64</span>) <span>panposition</span> {
	<span>position</span> <span>*=</span> <span>0.5</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>panposition</span>{
		<span>left</span>:  <span>position</span> <span>-</span> <span>0.5</span>,
		<span>right</span>: <span>position</span> <span>+</span> <span>0.5</span>,
	}
}
</code></pre></div><p>Here we are using a struct that can represent the amplitude on a scale of 0 to 1 for both the left
and right channel. Such that we observe the following values:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>position</th>
<th>left-channel</th>
<th>right-channel</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>0.5</td>
<td>0.5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In other words, if the position is zero the sound is perfectly balanced between the left and
right-side of your headphones. And in the extreme values, the sound is either only left-sided or
right-sided.</p>
<p>Just like in the previous post, we actually need to alter the frames based on the position data we
found in the <code>calculatePosition</code> function. We can create a function that modifies the frames based
on the <code>panposition</code> returned in the previous function.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> <span>applyPan</span>(<span>frames</span> []<span>wav</span>.<span>Frame</span>, <span>p</span> <span>panposition</span>) []<span>wav</span>.<span>Frame</span> {

	}
	<span>return</span> <span>out</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>Notice how for each <code>frame</code> we actually append two <code>frames</code> to the resulting slice! That is how we
are interleaving the left and right audio channel.</p>
<p>Now we can finish up the main method:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go">        <span>...</span>
	<span>pos</span> <span>:=</span> <span>calculatePosition</span>(<span>panfac</span>)

	<span>wave</span>.<span>NumChannels</span> = <span>2</span> <span>// samples are now stereo, so we need dual channels
</span><span></span>	<span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>wav</span>.<span>WriteFrames</span>(<span>scaledFrames</span>, <span>wave</span>.<span>WaveFmt</span>, <span>outfile</span>); <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> {
		panic(<span>err</span>)
	}
</code></pre></div><p>A crucial step here is that before writing the samples we have set ran <code>wave.NumChannels=2</code>. Without
this, the wave file would be interpreted as a mono sound file and our panning effect would have been
lost.</p>

<p>To test this, I find it easy to use an input file without a lot of things going on. I’m mainly using
this simple <a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/audio/part4/mono.wav">mono file</a>.</p>
<p>If we run <code>go run main.go -i mono.wav -o left-side.wav -p -1</code> we get:</p>
<p><a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/audio/part4/left-side.wav">left-side.wav</a></p>
<p>And when we  run <code>go run main.go -i mono.wav -o right-side.wav -p 1</code> we get:</p>
<p><a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/audio/part4/right-side.wav">right-side.wav</a></p>

<p>There is actually a flaw with this panning function that we are using. However it is not apparent to
us yet because we can only set a pan for an entire audio source. To see why this panning function is
not perfect we need to first introduce breakpoints as a way to create automation tracks, so the focus for our next few posts will be
breakpoints. :-)</p>

<p><strong>PHP is a dynamically typed scripting language</strong> and until the year
of 2015 php had no support for statically declared types at all. One
could cast to scalar types explicitly in the code, but declaring scalar
types in methods and functions signatures wasn't a thing until PHP 7.0
with the <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/scalar_type_hints_v5">Scalar Type Declarations</a>
and <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/return_types">Return Type Declarations</a> rfcs.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean that from version 7.0 PHP became a statically typed
language, though. <strong>It has type hinting that can be analyzed statically</strong>
but <strong>it still supports dynamic types</strong> and even allows them to be mixed.
See the example below:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

function returnsInt(): int
{
  return '100';
}</code></pre>
<p>No doubt that <strong>there's a type mismatch there</strong>. The return type is
supposed to be <em>int</em> and the returned type is in fact a <em>string</em>. Now,
what PHP does there is to automatically transform the token '100'
into an integer in order to return the required type. Even though it
seems to have an extra cost, it doesn't. PHP's type juggling is <em>nearly</em>
cost-free in many cases.</p>
<p>To better clarify how the language deals with types I'll split this article
into the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#kinds-of-types-in-php">Kinds of types in php</a></li>
<li><a href="#type-operations-in-php">Type "operations" in php</a></li>
<li><a href="#union-types">Union Types</a></li>
<li><a href="#php-type-juggling">PHP's type juggling</a></li>
<li><a href="#php-type-modes">PHP type modes</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have suggestions on what to add here, feel free to
<a href="https://twitter.com/nawarian">reach out to me on twitter</a> or opening an issue on
github.</p>
<h2 id="kinds-of-types-in-php">Kinds of types in php</h2>
<p>PHP's type system is very simplified when it comes to language features.
For example there's no <em>char</em> type, or <em>unsigned</em> types or even <em>int8</em>,
<em>int16</em>, <em>int32</em>, <em>int64</em>...</p>
<p>The <em>char</em> type is simplified to a string type and all <em>integer</em> variations
are simplified into an <em>integer</em> type. Whether that's a good or bad thing, is
up to you.</p>
<p>One can always inspect a variable's type using the
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.gettype">gettype()</a> function or using
the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.var-dump">var_dump()</a> function and
checking its output.</p>
<p>PHP comes with three different kinds of types: <strong>scalar types</strong>, <strong>compound types</strong>
and <strong>special types</strong>.</p>
<h3>Scalar types</h3>
<p>Scalar types are the bare bones of the language and they are four:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boolean (<code>bool</code> | <code>boolean</code>)</li>
<li>Integer (<code>int</code> | <code>integer</code>)</li>
<li>Float (<code>float</code> | <code>double</code>)</li>
<li>String (<code>string</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>By definition scalar types do not carry behaviour or state with themselves.
Expressions like <code>100-&gt;toString()</code> or <code>'thephp.website'::length()</code> are invalid.</p>
<p><strong>Main takeaway: scalar values do not have behaviour or state, they just represent
a value.</strong></p>
<h3>Compound types</h3>
<p>Compound types are much more interesting because even though they are very similar
to the scalar type, <strong>each one of the four compound types carry different syntactic
capabilities.</strong></p>
<p>The four compound types are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#compound-type-array">array</a></li>
<li><a href="#compound-type-object">object</a></li>
<li><a href="#compound-type-callable">callable</a></li>
<li><a href="#compound-type-iterable">iterable</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="compound-type-array">The array compound type</h4>
<p>An array is in fact a hashmap, built-in to the language. Meaning that it stores
values in a <strong>key =&gt; value</strong> manner. Even if you use it purely as a vector.</p>
<p>Arrays are very flexible structures when it comes to size, internal types and
key-value mapping. The examples below are all valid arrays:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

$vec = [0, 1, 2];
// $vec[1] is int(1)

$map = ['a' =&gt; 1, 'b' =&gt; 2];
// $map['a'] is int(1)

$map_ish = ['a' =&gt; 1, 0 =&gt; 2];
// $map_ish['a'] is int(1)
// $map_ish[0] =&gt; is int(2)</code></pre>
<p>Unlike C, php won't require you to define an array's size before creating it.
This of course comes with a memory consumption cost: the bigger your array size,
the more memory you'll consume in crazy proportions (in fact, arrays are allocated in powers of two).
How this consumption works is out of the scope of this article,
<a href="https://twitter.com/nawarian">feel free to ping me if you'd like to hear more</a>.</p>
<p>In case you're curious about this statement, the video below presents some charts
and further insights on arrays vs. object memory profiles.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JBWgvUrb-q8?start=1000" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""><iframe style="margin: auto; margin-bottom: 20px;" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JBWgvUrb-q8?start=1000" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>As you'll see bellow, arrays are also considered to be of type <em>iterable</em>, meaning
that you can iterate over them using a <em>foreach</em> loop. But they also provide
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.array.php">specific functions that can manipulate their internal pointers</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Main takeaway: array is an extremely flexible compound type that can be perceived
as a HashMap and is also considered an iterable type.</strong></p>
<h4 id="compound-type-object">The object compound type</h4>
<p>Due to php's architecture, the <em>object</em> compound type normally has a much lower memory
consumption profile when compared with arrays. That's because <em>normally</em> one would use
the object type by creating instances of classes.</p>
<p>Objects can carry state and behaviour. Meaning that php will offer dereferencing
language structs to access an object's internals. The snippet below illustrates
a php object's derefs:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

class MyClass
{
  private const A = 1;
  public int $property = 0;
  public function method(): void {}
}

$obj = new MyClass();
// $obj is object(MyClass)
// $obj::A is int(1)
// $obj-&gt;property is int(0)
// $obj-&gt;method() is null</code></pre>
<p>An object can also be normally created as a result of a type cast from an array.
Transforming an array's keys into objects property names. Such cast will always
result in an <code>object(stdClass)</code> type.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

$obj = (object) ['a' =&gt; 1];
// $obj is object(stdClass)
// $obj-&gt;a is int(1)</code></pre>
<p>Important to notice that casting an array with numeric keys into an object is valid,
but one can't dereference its value because property names may not start with numbers.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

$obj = (object) [0, 1]; // Legal
$obj-&gt;0; // Illegal</code></pre>
<p><strong>Main takeaway: objects normally have lower memory profiles than arrays, they carry
state and behaviour, they all inherit from stdClass and can be created by casting an
array.</strong></p>
<h4 id="compound-type-callable">The callable compound type</h4>
<p>A callable in php is anything that can be called (oh don't you say!!) with parenthesis
or with the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.call-user-func.php">call_user_func()</a>
function. In other words, a callable can fulfil the responsibility of what we know as
functions. Functions and methods are always callables. Objects and classes may also become
callables.</p>
<p>A callable can, by definition, have its reference stored in a variable. Like the following:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

$callable = 'strlen';</code></pre>
<p>What? But that's a string, no?</p>
<p>Well, yes. But it can be coerced into a callable if necessary. Like below:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

function callACallable(
  callable $f
): int {
  return $f('thephp.website');
}

$callable = 'strlen';

var_dump(
  $callable('thephp.website')
);
// int(14)

var_dump(
  callACallable($callable)
);
// int(14)</code></pre>
<p>Callables may also point to object methods:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

class MyClass
{
  public function myMethod(): int
  {
    return 1;
  }
}

$obj = new MyClass();
var_dump([$obj, 'myMethod']());
// int(1)</code></pre>
<p>Looks odd? I know it looks like an array. In fact it is. Unless you name it a callable 👀</p>
<p>This kind of callable above (object-method reference) is very interesting because
<strong>you can call private or protected methods</strong> with it <strong>if you're inside the class' scope.</strong>
Otherwise you may only call public methods with it.</p>
<p>Also classes that implement
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php#object.invoke">the __invoke() magic method</a>,
automatically transform their instances into callables themselves. Like the following:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

class MyCallableClass
{
  public function __invoke(): int
  {
    return 1;
  }
}

$obj = new MyCallableClass();
var_dump($obj());
// int(1)</code></pre>
<p><strong>Main takeaway: callables hold reference to functions or methods and can be
constructed in different ways.</strong></p>
<h4 id="compound-type-iterable">The iterable compound type</h4>
<p>Iterables are simpler to explain: they are by definition an array or an instance of
the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.traversable.php">Traversable interface</a>. The
main thing of an iterable is that it can be used in a
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/control-structures.foreach.php">foreach() loop</a>, with a
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.generators.syntax.php#control-structures.yield.from">yield from statement</a>
or with <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/spread_operator_for_array">spread operator</a>.</p>
<p>Examples of iterables are:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

function generator_function(): Generator
{
  // ...
};

// All variables here are iterables
$a = [0, 1, 2];
$b = generator_function();
$c = new ArrayObject();</code></pre>
<p><strong>Main takeaway: if you can fit it in a foreach(), it is an iterable.</strong></p>
<h3>Special Types</h3>
<p>There are two special types. And the biggest reason why they're called special, is that
<strong>you can't cast these types</strong>. The special types are both the <strong>resource</strong> type and
the <strong>NULL</strong> type.</p>
<p><strong>A resource represents a handle to an external resource</strong>. It can be a file handle,
an I/O stream or a database connection handle. You may guess now why you can't convert
a resource to any other type.</p>
<p><strong>The null type represents a null value</strong>. Meaning that a variable holding NULL was not
initialized, assigned to NULL or unset during runtime.</p>
<p><strong>Main takeaway: a special typed value can't be casted to anything.</strong></p>
<h3>What about class instances?</h3>
<p>Class instances have the type <code>object</code> and will always be presented like so. Executing
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.gettype">gettype()</a> on an object will always return
a <code>string("object")</code> and calling <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.var-dump">var_dump()</a>
on an object will always print its value using the <code>object(ClassName)</code> notation. If you need
to fetch an object's class as a string, use the
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.get-class">get_class()</a> function.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

$obj = new stdClass();

echo gettype($obj);
// object

var_dump($obj);
// object(stdClass)#1 (0) {
// ...

echo get_class($obj);
// \stdClass</code></pre>
<h2 id="type-operations-in-php">Type "operations" in php</h2>
<p>There are different "operations" one can do with PHP when it comes to types. I believe
it is important to clearly state them here so that we don't mix things up later on.</p>
<h3>Type juggling: type casting and coercion</h3>
<p>Before we dive in, here are three important definitions we need keep in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Type conversion</strong> means to transform a type from A to B. For example: from integer to float.</li>
<li><strong>Type cast</strong> means to <strong>manually</strong> or <strong>explicitly</strong> convert a type from A to B. As in <code>$hundred = (int) 100.0</code>. (<code>float(100.0)</code> became <code>int(100)</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Type coercion</strong> means to <strong>implicitly</strong> convert a type from A to B. As in <code>$twenty = 10 + '10 bananas';</code>. (<code>string("10 bananas")</code> became <code>int(10)</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>Being that said, the following sections explain how it happens in php. Later on you'll find
more information on Type Juggling.</p>
<h4>Type casting</h4>
<p>Similar to what Java does, php allows type casting. Meaning that when a variable points to
a value that can be casted to a different type, it allows manual (explicit) type conversion.</p>
<p>Wait, wait. What!? 🤨</p>
<p>Given a variable <code>$hundred</code> holding a <code>string("100")</code> its value may be manually converted (casted)
to become an <code>int(100)</code> or a <code>float(100.00)</code> - or any other scalar type or one of compound
types <em>array</em> or <em>object</em>.</p>
<p>The following snippet works just fine in PHP and is very similar to Java:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

$hundred = (int) '100';
// $hundred is now int(100)</code></pre>
<p>Now, one thing Java does and is completely illegal on php code, is to …</p></iframe></div></article></div>

Amazon is reportedly using its venture capital arm to fund startups only to steal business ideas from them. Amazon is accused of investing in small firms to actually obtain information about products developed by them. The e-commerce retailer then uses this confidential information to launch its own service based on such data.</p><p>According to a report in the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-tech-startup-echo-bezos-alexa-investment-fund-11595520249">Wall Street Journal(Paywall)</a>, Amazon.com’s venture-capital fund invested in DefinedCrowd and gained access to the technology startup’s finances and other confidential information. Four years later the marketplace launched a similar artificial intelligence product that does almost exactly what DefinedCrowd does.</p><p>DefinedCrowd founder and CEO Daniela Braga has accused Amazon of stealing their concept to launch its own product. Amazon recently launched a new Amazon Web Services (AWS) product called A2I. DefinedCrowd CEO says that it is completely based on their product and competes directly with them. And all this under the garb of venture capital funding.</p><p>Another company that suffered a similar fate was LivingSocial. LivingSocial officials met with Amazon’s venture capital firm to discuss a potential investment. At the end of the talks, Amazon purchased 30 percent of LivingSocial equity. After buying the share in LivingSocial, Amazon requested access to proprietary LivingSocial data. In a few months, Amazon started reaching out to its own clients offering better deals for similar products.</p><p>Even Amazon’s Echo seems to have been developed using this predatory thieving. A company that built Ubi, a smart speaker was in talks with Amazon for seed funding. The Ubi officials met with Amazo several times to discuss funding and concepts. It was just a matter of days before Amazon launched a similar product to Ubi- Amazon’s Echo. Due to the Echo launch, Ubi has all but disappeared.</p><p>WSJ report says that many startup founders claimed that after Amazon launched rival products their businesses collapsed. Some say they were being forced to downsize their companies due to Amazon’s competition.</p><p>Amazon has refused to comment on the predatory nature of its venture capital fund. Amazon says that such funding meetings are confidential in nature. Amazon, however, added that information obtained from such meetings is not used to build competing products, noting that any such claims are typically resolved in court.</p><p>“For 26 years, we’ve pioneered many features, products, and even whole new categories. From amazon.com itself to Kindle to Echo to AWS, few companies can claim a track record for innovation that rivals Amazon’s,” an Amazon spokesperson told <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-startup-investment-competitors-wsj-report-echo-nucleus-ubi-2020-7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a>. “Unfortunately, there will always be self-interested parties who complain rather than build. Any legitimate disputes about intellectual property ownership are rightly resolved in the courts.”</p><p>While court decisions may take a long time and many of these startups are too small to fight with a giant like Amazon armed with a battery of A-list lawyers, it is answerable to the US anti-trust body which it will be facing next week. The Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos will have to testify in the official hearing scheduled for Monday in front of the House Judiciary Committee.</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Many people ask me why I chose not to pursue a PhD directly after college. I figured I might as well centralize my thoughts in one place. This essay is for computer science or technical grads:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interested in machine learning</li>
<li>Enjoy working on hard, unsolved technical challenges</li>
<li>Possibly choosing between research or industry</li>
</ul>
<p>As someone who deeply enjoys thinking about and coding solutions to open-ended research questions, I genuinely considered going to a PhD program. To come to a decision, I spent a while pondering why many students with research experience don’t pursue a PhD directly after undergrad. I think there are many reasons why people don’t go directly to PhD programs, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Effort</em>: it’s a lot of work to write applications for many schools, get solid recommendation letters, pay a lot of money in application fees, go through interviews, align with professors, secure funding, and more.</li>
<li><em>Comfort</em>: industry perks and salaries can be more attractive than graduate school stipends and long work hours.</li>
<li><em>Inertia</em>: if you’re not absolutely sure it’s right for you, the thought of switching trajectories midway into the program is very anxiety-provoking.</li>
</ul>
<p>I felt like I could put in the effort to apply and would enjoy a PhD program if I got in, but I still didn’t know what to do. Delaying the decision didn’t feel optimal either, since even if I worked in industry for a few years before going to a PhD program, I didn’t think I’d easily accustom to a large pay cut and working on problem sets again. Understandably, the PhD vs Industry decision caused me a lot of stress! Halfway through my senior year, I wrote down some pros and cons for each choice. In practice, an industry job for me meant working at a startup since I didn’t really enjoy my engineering internships at large companies. </p>
<p>Here, I discuss the raw pros and cons of pursuing a PhD and pros and cons of joining an early-stage machine learning startup. I wrote these in my journal in January 2019, and I provide some relevant commentary from my current self as a machine learning engineer (July 2020) in the nested bullets.</p>
<h2>Pros of pursuing a PhD (immediately after graduating)</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>I can prioritize my curiosity and have the freedom to learn about what I find intellectually engaging.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Now that I’ve been at a startup, although I can still be curious about many things, I have to work on things that provide business value. The ability to not be constrained by industry value is a real pro here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I can deeply hone technical expertise and have many people respect me for it.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I’m cringing at how much external validation I used to seek. Being in computer science is playing the <a href="https://nav.al/long-term">long game</a>. You don’t always get external validation, and good work can take a while.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It’s easier to “be my own boss” if I were doing research.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe? Ask a researcher this question. But <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/08/16/how-do-you-work-on-something-important/">choosing what to work on is challenging</a>, regardless of whether you’re in research or engineering.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I actually really enjoy research more than engineering.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes I still feel that I enjoy research more than engineering, but I’ve committed to developing my engineering skills. Again, being in tech is playing the long game, and having good engineering skills will help me no matter where I go, whether it’s research or IC or management.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>There are more clear mentorship opportunities for me.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This is probably true if I went to a PhD program, since I’d have access to many professors and older grad student friends.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I can be in a stable career option (5-6 years at least if doing PhD).</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This point occasionally gives me anxiety, since I don’t know exactly where I am going to be for the next 5-6 years. Startups are risky. But I’ve gotten more used to this feeling over the past year. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cons of pursuing a PhD (immediately after graduating)</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Maybe I’m a shitty researcher or will find out that I’m a shitty researcher.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Still a fear of mine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It’s unclear whether I want to end up in academia or industry research, so a PhD could be for nothing.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>One of my math PhD friends explains a PhD as “a socially acceptable reason for screwing around with whatever you’re interested in.” I like this reference, so technically going to a PhD program isn’t a waste if I enjoy it in the process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Incentives in academia are horrible. There are so many major conferences. How do you balance long term gains with getting the publications out?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This is really true. A year ago, I didn’t know how to think long-term. I probably would have tried to maximize my number of papers and burned out in my 3rd year, complaining that I’m not working on anything truly impactful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>A PhD can be really long and hard.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I love Philip Guo’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/15731248-the-ph-d-grind"><em>The PhD Grind</em></a>. Unfortunately he recently took his website down, which hosted the book.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pros of joining an ML startup</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>I can learn how to build things from scratch.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Painfully true — building from scratch is challenging, but the growing pains are necessary to deeply understand productionizing ML. </li>
<li>At the time, I didn’t know about the existence of “real-world” ML and engineering tools such as <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Spark</a>, <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/">Airflow</a>, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, or <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>. These tools are super relevant and learning them can be its own pro.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I can see how research is applied in industry and measure the gap between research and industry.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This gap is larger than I expected. It’s also really fun to apply state-of-the-art research to business cases. For example, we recently productionized a transformer model.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I can gain leadership skills from the beginning and be a key figure in recruiting and defining the culture.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I was thrown into the fire as soon as I joined. Now, a year later, I’ve probably done over a hundred technical interviews, led a few ML projects for key clients, and mentored a couple of interns. I would definitely not have gotten this experience at a larger company.</li>
<li>It’s also cool to be able to choose who you work with (to some extent) by hiring people that fit in with the culture you help to define.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I can closely work with both experienced engineers and non-technical domain experts.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I have learned so much from every single one of my coworkers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I am relatively immune to any level of risk this early in my career.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This honestly just speaks to my insane privileges of graduating from a top school, having experience at big tech companies, and being a US citizen. I am quite thankful for these things.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cons of joining an ML startup</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Possibly being the only woman, potentially for a long time.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Bleh. True. No comment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>This is not the route to maximize expected earnings. I could get paid more at a larger company. Only in the small chance that the startup succeeds will I make a lot of money.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>True, but I now feel like this really isn’t a priority for me. Being in tech gives me the privilege of making a high salary wherever I go, and I think that <a href="http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2019628,00.html">as long as I can live comfortably</a> (as I do now), I’m happy. Maybe this will change if I’m trying to buy a house or have a family.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>My technical accomplishments aren’t seen outside the startup.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This is somewhat false. I think there are some people outside my company who respect my technical abilities.</li>
<li>This point also doesn’t really matter too much, since<a href="https://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/"> one’s career involves more than just how prolific of a programmer they are.</a> </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I could be overworking myself.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I think this is true of any job. There are always opportunities to work more than you’re expected to. Also, as a new grad, <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-mistakes-which-software-engineers-make-in-their-early-years/answer/Edmond-Lau">optimizing for learning rate</a> can feel like overworking oneself, especially in the beginning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>If I don’t care about the specific application, I might not be motivated to do quality work.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Surprisingly, I don’t care too much about cars (my company’s application), but I am really, really motivated to solve the technical challenges my company faces.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>My story and decision-making process<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></h2>
<p>Thinking back to the fall of 2018, I remember how stressed I felt drafting my statement of purpose. I’m the kind of person who’s never fully confident in my decisions — there’s always a nagging <em>what if?</em> in my brain. I didn’t feel a magnetic pull towards academia. I also didn’t feel like I was destined to make a huge impact in industry. What does one pursue if they’re just…unsure? I felt this urge to apply to PhD programs — after all, I grew up in a college town, I’m a professor’s daughter, and most of my closest childhood and university friends are in PhD programs.</p>
<p>One of my older friends told me, “If you know what problem you want to solve, then find the place where you’re most likely to help devise a solution.”  <em>Robustness in machine learning models is something only academics are working on</em>, I naively thought at the time. So maybe a PhD was the right move. But as I drafted my statement of purpose, writing about how we needed to construct and solve relevant toy problems because it would be imperative to have safe and robust machine learning models in the real world, it seemed silly to me that I wanted to research this field when I had never actually worked on machine learning in the real world.  What new perspectives could I bring? Why should a school accept me?</p>
<p>My wonderful undergraduate advisor, <a href="https://graphics.stanford.edu/~hanrahan/">Pat Hanrahan</a>, urged me to consider working in industry for a couple years before going to a PhD program. I didn’t like the suggestion at first — what if I would never end up doing a PhD? “Well, then you’ve saved yourself five or six years! If you don’t want to do a PhD, you’ll find out eventually,” he laughed. </p>
<p>Pat had a point, so I started to look for industry machine learning jobs. Fortunately, since I had significant ML research experience for an undergrad, I could pick between many options. Did I want to do machine learning at a large company? Small company? Focus on a specific vertical?  I thought back to my machine learning project at Facebook, where I wrote a few lines of SQL to use a well-oiled tool called <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/core-data/introducing-fblearner-flow-facebook-s-ai-backbone/">FBLearner</a> to set up a gradient boosting classifier. I thought about machine learning at Google, where engineers write <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub43438/">Borg</a> scripts to throw lots of serialized data at one of many models in a zoo.

<p><strong>Die Corona-Warn-App funktioniert nach Recherchen von </strong><strong><em>tagesschau.de</em></strong><strong> auf vielen iPhones nur fehlerhaft. Besitzer werden oft zu spät gewarnt. Die Entwickler räumten das Problem ein - und sehen den Fehler bei Apple. </strong></p>
<p><em>Von Dominik Lauck, tagesschau.de</em></p>
<p> Fünf Wochen nach dem Start der Corona-Warn-App sind Probleme bei der Nutzung bekannt geworden. Nach Recherchen von <em>tagesschau.de</em> funktioniert auf vielen iPhones die Kontaktüberprüfung nur lückenhaft. Nutzerinnen und Nutzer wurden teilweise über Wochen nicht über die App informiert, ob sie Kontakt zu Infizierten hatten oder nicht. SAP, das die App zusammen mit der Deutschen Telekom entwickelt hat, räumte den Fehler ein.</p>
<!-- infobox -->
<p> "Da gibt es Probleme, und ich hoffe ganz stark, dass die entweder sehr, sehr schnell beseitigt werden oder wir einen wirksamen Workaround finden, (…) um trotzdem die Funktionalität auf die Beine zu stellen", sagt Thomas Klingbeil, der Software-Architekt der Corona-Warn-App bei SAP gegenüber <em>tagesschau.de</em>.</p>
<h2>Hintergrundaktualisierung wird nicht aufgerufen</h2>
<p> Woran hakt es? Auch wenn die Corona-Warn-App nicht geöffnet ist, soll sie im Hintergrund weiterlaufen und Daten aktualisieren. Wenn es eine Begegnung mit einer Person gab, die dann positiv auf das Coronavirus getestet wurde, soll das Handy den Besitzer eigentlich aktiv mit einer Benachrichtigung auf das erhöhte Risiko hinweisen. "Das Problem, das wir haben, ist, dass die Hintergrundaktualisierung vom Betriebssystem offenbar nicht aufgerufen wird", so Klingbeil.</p><!-- mediaCon-->
<p> Zuvor hatte die "Bild"-Zeitung bereits über ähnliche Probleme bei einigen Android-Geräten berichtet. Dort war die Hintergrundaktualisierung im Stromsparmodus nicht oder nur eingeschränkt möglich. "Das gilt nicht nur für die Corona-Warn-App, sondern für alle Apps auf diesen Smartphones", hieß es dazu aus dem Bundesgesundheitsministerium. Laut Entwickler ist das keine Fehlfunktion in der App, sondern hängt mit den Einstellungen bei den Geräten zusammen. Dies könne von den Nutzern geändert werden.</p>
<p> Das Gesundheitsministerium versicherte, dass die Anwendung "zu jeder Zeit" funktioniert habe. Wer seine Einstellung nicht anpasste, wurde erst beim Öffnen der App vor einem möglichen gefährlichen Kontakt mit einem Corona-Infizierten gewarnt. "Mit der Version 1.1.1, die am Mittwoch erschienen ist, können die Nutzerinnen und Nutzern, diese fehlerhaften Optimierungsfunktionen des Betriebssystems übersteuern", erklärte Jürgen Müller aus dem SAP-Vorstand <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/corona-warn-app-und-sie-funktioniert-doch-juergen-mueller">in einem Blogeintrag</a>.</p>
<h2>Problem bei iPhones noch nicht behoben</h2>
<p> Anders als bei den Android-Geräten ist bei den iPhones das Problem noch nicht behoben. Einige Nutzer berichten gegenüber <em>tagesschau.de</em>, dass an mehr als zehn aufeinanderfolgenden Tagen kein Abgleich erfolgte. Das heißt, sie wären im Extremfall erst zehn Tage später gewarnt worden, dass sie Kontakt mit Infizierten gehabt hatten.</p>
<p> Normalerweise werden die Daten in der App alle 24 Stunden aktualisiert. Wann genau steht unter dem Punkt "Risikoermittlung" beziehungsweise in den Einstellungen des Smartphones. Pro Tag sollen bis zu 14 Datensätze abgerufen werden - einen für jeden der zurückliegenden 14 Tage. "Wenn die App in den letzten zwei Wochen dauerhaft aktiv war, sollten Sie in der Regel 13 oder 14 Überprüfungen in den letzten 24 Stunden sehen", erklären die Entwickler. Die Zahl der abgerufenen Datensätze sagt nichts darüber aus, ob oder wieviele Kontakte die App mit anderen Corona-Warn-Apps ermittelt hat.</p>
<!-- infobox -->
<h2>Fehler liegt im Betriebssystem von Apple</h2>
<p> Die Entwickler haben Apple über die Lücken bei der Kontaktüberprüfung informiert, der iPhone-Hersteller habe den Fehler mittlerweile eingeräumt. Nach bisherigen Erkenntnissen befindet sich im Betriebssystem iOS ein Bug. Dort ist ein sogenannter Scheduler einprogrammiert, der dafür sorgt, dass die Corona-Warn-App im Hintergrund die Daten einmal täglich vom Server holt.</p>
<p> "Wir sind vollkommen auf ein regelmäßiges Funktionieren des Schedulers angewiesen", erklärt Peter Lorenz, Chefentwickler der Deutschen Telekom, gegenüber <em>tagesschau.de</em>. "Dieser Scheduler hat hin und wieder einen Schluckauf." Dadurch unterbleibe der Impuls, die Daten vom Server abzurufen.</p>
<!-- infobox -->
<h2>Ministerium räumt Fehler ein</h2>
<p> Das Problem haben die Entwickler nach eigenen Aussagen "vor einer Woche" bemerkt. Auch in der Schweiz, Österreich und Italien hätten die Programmierer der dortigen Corona-Apps entsprechende Probleme festgestellt. "Uns war nicht bekannt, in welcher Breite das Problem auftritt", so Lorenz.</p>
<p> Das Ausmaß sei erst an diesem Freitag erkannt worden, als sich die Entwickler nach den Berichten über die Android-Fehler auch das Apple-Betriebssystem genauer angeschaut hätten. "Die Entwickler arbeiten mit Hochdruck an einem Weg, die systembedingten Einschränkungen zu umgehen, bis Apple das Systemproblem selbst gelöst hat", erklärte das Gesundheitsministerium auf Anfrage. SAP-Sprecher Hilmar Schepp zeigte sich zuversichtlich, "bis Anfang der kommenden Woche" eine vorübergehende Lösung zu haben, den Bug zu umgehen.</p>
<h2>Codes werden weiterhin ausgetauscht</h2>
<p> Sowohl bei den Android- als auch bei den Apple-Smartphones würden jedoch auch ohne die Hintergrundaktualisierung anonyme Codes mit anderen Smartphones ausgetauscht, versichern die Entwickler. Allerdings wird ein Nutzer bei fehlender Hintergrundaktualisierung nur dann über ein Ansteckungsrisiko informiert, wenn er die App öffnet.</p>
<p> Wie viele Geräte von den Problemen betroffen sind, ist nicht bekannt. Insgesamt wurde die App in Deutschland bereits 16,2 Millionen Mal heruntergeladen. Noch am Nachmittag hatte das Gesundheitsministerium erklärt, das Problem mit der aussetzenden Hintergrundaktualisierung sei bei iPhones nicht aufgetreten. "Im Moment können wir sagen, dass es nicht alle Androidgeräte betroffen hat, sondern nur bestimmte", sagte eine Sprecherin.</p><div>
<div>
<!-- mediaCon-->
<h4>So können Sie die Kontaktüberprüfung abrufen</h4>
<div><p>In den Einstellungen Ihres Smartphones können Sie sehen, ob die Kontaktüberprüfung der Corona-Warn-App reibungslos funktioniert oder Lücken aufweist. Dazu sind folgende Schritte nötig:</p><p><strong>iPhone:</strong> <br>Einstellungen -&gt; Datenschutz -&gt; Health -&gt; COVID-19-Kontaktprotokoll -&gt; Kontaktüberprüfungen </p><p><strong>Android-Geräte: </strong><br>Einstellungen -&gt; Google -&gt; COVID-19-Benachrichtigungen an</p></div>

</div><!-- teaser -->
</div>

<h2>App soll Infektionsketten unterbrechen</h2>
<p> Die Corona-Warn-App wurde <a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/corona-warn-app-startet-101.html">am 16. Juni veröffentlicht</a> und ist in den Stores <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.rki.coronawarnapp">von Google</a> und <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/corona-warn-app/id1512595757">Apple</a> erhältlich. Sie soll helfen, Infektionsketten nachzuverfolgen und zu unterbrechen. Außerdem kann sie dazu beitragen, dass Menschen nach einem Coronavirus-Test möglichst schnell ihr Testergebnis digital erhalten und über die App anonym mögliche Kontaktpersonen warnen können, wenn diese auch die App installiert haben.</p>

                        <p>If the proximate purpose of technology is to reduce scarcity, the ultimate purpose of technology is to eliminate mortality.</p><p>At first that sounds crazy. But let's start with the premise: is the proximate purpose of technology to reduce scarcity? Think about how a breakthrough is described: faster, smaller, cheaper, better. All of these words mean that with this new technology, one can do <em>more with less</em>. In the digital world, Google made information on any topic free to anyone with an Internet connection, and WhatsApp made it free to communicate with the same. In the physical world, innovations like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber_process">Haber Process</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug#Expansion_to_South_Asia:_the_Green_Revolution">Green Revolution</a> allowed us to produce more with less. In a real sense, these technologies <em>reduced scarcity</em>.</p><p>Now for second half of the sentence, the logical implication. Is the ultimate purpose of technology to eliminate mortality? Well, mortality is the main source of scarcity. If we had infinite time, we would be less concerned with whether something was faster. The reason speed has value is because time has value; the reason time has value is because human life has value, and lifespans are finite. If you made lifespans much longer, you'd reduce the effective cost of <em>everything</em>. Thus insofar as reducing scarcity is acknowledged to be the proximate purpose of technology, eliminating the main source of scarcity – namely mortality – is the ultimate purpose of technology. <strong>Life extension is the most important thing we can invent.</strong></p><p>And it's actually feasible today. It's been shown that we can extend healthy lifespans in mammals – and even <em>reverse</em> aging to bring people back to youth.

</figure><p>You probably weren't aware of this, though. You probably also weren't aware of how far we've come on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00339-3">gene therapy</a>, how much has been done in <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/rna-injection-restores-hearing-in-guinea-pigs-30855">regenerative medicine</a>, how advanced the latest <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2285-x">bionic eyes</a> are – or how <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1228447944287932416">deadly</a> COVID-19 was as a threat until March of 2020.</p><h2 id="a-duty-to-evangelize-technological-progress">A duty to evangelize technological progress</h2><p>That is because people with scientific and technical backgrounds have not taken it upon ourselves to write about technological progress <em>as a duty</em>. We need to take time out of our busy days to make the case, repeatedly and with high production values, that technological progress is the <em>most </em>important thing we can do for broad-based prosperity and economic growth, and for life itself.</p><p>That starts with testing, drugs, treatments, and vaccines for COVID-19. But it goes far beyond that. Put another way: we may not get life extension or the whole suite of transhumanist technologies (brain-machine interfaces, stem cells, CRISPR gene therapy, and more) unless you, personally, evangelize them online. Not just tweets, but articles. Not just articles, but videos. Not just videos, but feature films. And not just a few films, but an <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/how-long-would-it-take-to-watch-all-of-netflix/">entire Netflix original library's worth</a>, a parallel tech media ecosystem full of inspirational content for technological progressives. A lifetime's worth of content that makes the case for immutable money, infinite frontier, artificial intelligence, and eternal life.</p><p>This may mean less focus on the businesses and personalities of technology. After all, do we care whether the technology for reversing aging is developed by a startup, an academic lab, a scientific consortium, or a solitary biohacker in their garage? No. What we care about is the goal of transcendence. If the technology ends up being <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Patenting-Sun-Polio-Salk-Vacine/dp/0688094945">completely free</a> and open source, so much the better. A corporate vehicle is just one means to an end, not an end in itself. We may need to understand every detail of operating a business, but we can't get lost in those details.</p><p>The point of doing a startup after all is to build something you can't buy. Money can't yet buy you a trip to <a href="https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/">Mars</a>. Or a <a href="https://www.neuralink.com/">neural implant</a>. Or a <a href="https://tricorder.xprize.org/prizes/tricorder">medical tricorder</a>. And at one point in the not-too-distant past it could not buy you a web browser, a search engine, or a smartphone. When the iPhone did not exist, people had to invent it. And they needed to be inspired to invent it.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>for iphone 1:</p><p>the original mac,<br>blade runner,<br>2001: a space odyssey,<br>sony walkman TPS-L2, <br>braun ET66, <br>the concorde, <br>massimo vignale, <br>henry dreyfuss, <br>apollo 11, <br>the beatles,<br>warp records,<br>NASA,<br>polaroid,<br>arthur c. clarke,<br>eero saarinen</p><p>among others… <a href="https://t.co/F3ayC03T3y">https://t.co/F3ayC03T3y</a></p></div>— Imran Chaudhri (@imranchaudhri) <a href="https://twitter.com/imranchaudhri/status/1092194839540584449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 3, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><h2 id="a-sense-of-purpose">A sense of purpose</h2><p>Why doesn't inspirational content for technological progressives exist in abundance? Part of the reason is adverse selection. While science fiction – even dystopian science fiction – can inspire, the scientists, engineers, founders, and funders thus inspired are often more occupied with building technology than evangelizing it. But this in turn means that we aren't directly educating the next generation, or the public at large.</p><p>We need to change that. Specifically, people who know math and science, who have experience in managing and investing, who are <em>technological progressives</em> rather than technological conservatives – these people need to learn to write, report, publish, and direct. We need to consciously build a parallel tech-driven decentralized media ecosystem, and we need it to become the first point of call for anyone seeking to learn about technology.</p><p>In this we will have allies around the world. Only the very richest people can afford to be cynical about the merits of technological progress. The <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2019/5/28/the-end-of-mobile">billions</a> of people who just got their first smartphone have had their lives dramatically improved as a consequence, and are too pragmatic to romanticize the past. If you haven't already internalized this point, take two minutes to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpvEWVVnICE">this</a>.</p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QpvEWVVnICE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Back? OK. So, building a media ecosystem for technological progressives clearly starts with technical education. At the K-12 level, we've already got plenty of learning apps, and the next step is remote schools. And at the level of collegiate education and continuous learning, Lambda School, Fast.ai, Coursera, Udacity, Udemy, Binance Academy, and the countless GitHub tutorials are an amazing start. But our duty extends beyond education to media of all kinds, particularly visual media.</p><p>The tech ecosystem has natural advantages here. We have the domain knowledge. And the experts at hand. We're already doing content marketing, podcasts, conferences, and a tweetstorm or two. We understand search engines, social networks, and distribution. And yes, we have learned to code.</p><p>What we haven't done yet is <em>full stack narrative</em>. That is, with a <a href="https://wistia.com/series/one-ten-one-hundred">few exceptions</a>, like Elon Musk, we haven't really told story arcs with technological progress at the center. We haven't taken the pitch we use to recruit engineers and externalized it for the public. We haven't infused <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1276010131990261761">emotion</a> and meaning into our public communications. We haven't made every one of our companies a media company. We haven't set out to tell our story ourselves.</p><p>We need to correct that immediately, and start evangelizing technological progress with every word and action. To recognize that the purpose of technology is to transcend our limits, and to motivate everything we're doing with a sense of that purpose. To take the winnings from our web apps and <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-did-Elon-Musk-fund-his-businesses-from-PayPal-to-SpaceX-and-Tesla">put them towards Mars</a>, to feel no hesitation towards starting small and no shame in dreaming big, to tell the world that it actually is possible to <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/rna-injection-restores-hearing-in-guinea-pigs-30855">cure the deaf</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2285-x">restore sight</a>, and <a href="http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2020/03/old-human-cells-rejuvenated-with-stem-cell-technology.html">end</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nXop2lLDa4">death</a> <a href="https://www.ldeming.com/longevityfaq">itself</a>.</p>

<p><em>Work-in-progress LVGL GUI Framework ported to Wayland EGL on PinePhone with Ubuntu Touch</em></p>
<p><strong>We ❤️ &nbsp; Old Underwear...</strong></p>
<p>They feel comfy, they fit our contours. Nevermind the holes and the old stains 🤢</p>
<p><strong>X11 is like Old Underwear.</strong> It's been around for 30 years... Yet we still use it in spite of its feature gaps and wonky quirks.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/PinePhone"><strong>PinePhone on Ubuntu Touch feels like... New Underwear.</strong></a></p>
<p>It runs Linux but it has none of the legacy X11 code. Because it's optimised for a great mobile experience with <strong>Wayland.</strong></p>
<p>But New Underwear feels uncomfortable. So today we'll learn Wayland and understand how apps are built with Wayland.</p>
<p>Hopefully someday we'll move on to newer, simpler app frameworks (like <a href="https://lvgl.io/">LVGL</a> and Flutter) as we discard our Old Underwear: X11, SDL, GTK, Qt, ...</p>
<p>The source code for this article may be found here...</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">X11</a> is the Graphical Display Service that runs on most Linux desktops and notebooks.</p>
<p>Let's hunt for the X11 Service on Pinebook Pro...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-pinebook.png" alt="X11 Service on Pinebook Pro"></p>
<p>That's the X11 Service... A <strong>2.2 MB</strong> executable named <strong><code>Xorg</code></strong>. </p>
<p>The X11 Service controls the rendering of Linux apps (as well as the keyboard and mouse input) like this...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-x11.png" alt="X11 Architecture"></p>
<p>(Adapted from <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/architecture.html">"Wayland Architecture"</a>)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>At the top we have the Linux programs running on our Linux machine: <strong>Terminal, Editor, Web Browser</strong>.</p>
<p>Each program renders its graphical display and transmits the raw graphics to the X11 Service (via a local TCP socket).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>X11 Service forwards the rendered graphics to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing_window_manager"><strong>Window Manager / Compositor</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The Window Manager / Compositor is provided by the <strong>Desktop Environment</strong>: Xfce, KDE, Gnome, ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Window Manager / Compositor wraps the rendered graphics into Display Windows and <strong>"decorates"</strong> them with scrollbars, title bar and minimise / maximise / close buttons.</p>
<p>The Window Manager / Compositor then draws the Display Windows into a <strong>Screen Buffer</strong> according to their screen coordinates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Screen Buffer is rendered to our screen by the X11 Service, talking to the <strong>Linux Display Driver</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any <strong>keyboard and mouse input</strong> is captured by the X11 Service, and forwarded to the programs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Why is X11 so complex? So many hops?</em></p>
<p>Because X11 was designed for Distributed Computing Systems.</p>
<p>Here's how I used (abused?) X11R4 at <a href="http://srg.cs.illinois.edu/">UIUC Systems Research Group</a> way back in 1990 (30 years ago!)...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-uiuc.png" alt="Distributed X11 System"></p>
<p>Thankfully things are a lot simpler now, lemme explain...</p>

<p><em>Do we need overlapping or tiled windows on PinePhone?</em></p>
<p><em>Do we need to need to decorate PinePhone windows with a title bar and minimise / maximise / close buttons?</em></p>
<p><em>Do we even need any windows on PinePhone?</em></p>
<p>No! Because each PinePhone app takes control of the entire screen!</p>
<p>PinePhone uses a simpler Graphical Display Service: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(display_server_protocol)#Wayland_compositors"><strong>Wayland Compositor</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Let's hunt for the Wayland Compositor on PinePhone...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-compositor.png" alt="Wayland Compositor on PinePhone"></p>
<p>That's the Wayland Compositor... A <strong>262 KB</strong> executable named <code>unity-system-compositor</code>. </p>
<p><em>Compare that with the 2.2 MB X11 Server on Pinebook Pro!</em></p>
<p>Here's how the Wayland Compositor controls apps and touchscreen input on PinePhone with Ubuntu Touch...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-arch.png" alt="Wayland Architecture"></p>
<p>(Adapted from <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/architecture.html">"Wayland Architecture"</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGL_(API)">"EGL API"</a>)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>At the top we have the apps running on our phone: <strong>Terminal, Editor, Web Browser</strong>.</p>
<p>Since each app runs fullscreen, only the active app will be rendered.</p>
<p>When then app starts, it queries the <strong>Wayland Compositor</strong> for the graphical display interfaces available. (They talk via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_file_types#Socket">Linux socket file</a>: <code>/run/user/32011/wayland-0</code>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wayland Compositor returns the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGL_(API)"><strong>EGL Interface</strong></a> to the app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>App calls the EGL Interface to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL"><strong>render OpenGL graphics</strong></a> directly to the <strong>Linux Display Driver</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Linux Display Driver forwards the OpenGL rendering commands to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit"><strong>GPU to update the screen</strong></a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any <strong>touchscreen input</strong> is captured by the Wayland Compositor, and forwarded to the active app.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Wayland looks so much simpler and faster than X11!</p>
<p><em>Wayland is designed for OpenGL and GPUs?</em></p>
<p>Yes! And I lied about Wayland being New Underwear... Wayland is not really that New!</p>
<p>Wayland was first released in 2008 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(display_server_protocol)">11 years ago</a>)... Yet it was designed around OpenGL and GPUs, the same tech that powers our beautiful games today. (<a href="https://youtu.be/DNBk9hnPkTY">And websites too</a>)</p>
<p>Read on to learn how to render our own OpenGL graphics with Wayland and Ubuntu Touch on PinePhone...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-egl.jpg" alt="Rendering a yellow rectangle with Wayland and OpenGL on PinePhone"></p>
<p><em>Rendering a yellow rectangle with Wayland and OpenGL on PinePhone</em></p>

<p>Here's the function that calls OpenGL to render the yellow box above: <a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-mir/blob/master/egl.c#L44-L60"><code>pinephone-mir/egl.c</code></a></p>
<pre><code>/// Render the OpenGL ES2 display
static void render_display() {
    //  Fill the rectangular region with yellow
    glClearColor(
        1.0,  //  Red
        1.0,  //  Green
        0.0,  //  Blue
        1.0   //  Alpha
    );
    glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

    // Render now
    glFlush();
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>render_display()</code> looks exactly like normal OpenGL, and it works on PinePhone with Wayland! (Thanks to Ubuntu Touch)</p>
<p>Two things to note...</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>PinePhone supports a popular subset of OpenGL, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_ES"><strong>OpenGL for Embedded Systems</strong></a> Version 2.0.</p>
<p>OpenGL ES is optimised for Embedded Devices. It's used by many mobile and console games today.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To render OpenGL ES graphics, we need to get the <strong>OpenGL ES Context</strong> and <strong>Window Surface</strong> from Wayland</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Before calling <code>render_display()</code>, we fetch the OpenGL Window Surface from Wayland like so: <a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-mir/blob/master/egl.c#L167-L189"><code>pinephone-mir/egl.c</code></a></p>
<pre><code>/// Dimensions of the OpenGL region to be rendered
static int WIDTH  = 480;
static int HEIGHT = 360;

static struct wl_egl_window *egl_window;  //  Wayland EGL Window
static EGLSurface egl_surface;            //  EGL Surface

//  Create the EGL Window and render OpenGL graphics
static void create_window(void) {
    //  Create an EGL Window from a Wayland Surface 
    egl_window = wl_egl_window_create(surface, WIDTH, HEIGHT);
    assert(egl_window != EGL_NO_SURFACE);  //  Failed to create OpenGL Window

    //  Create an OpenGL Window Surface for rendering
    egl_surface = eglCreateWindowSurface(egl_display, egl_conf,
        egl_window, NULL);
    assert(egl_surface != NULL);  //  Failed to create OpenGL Window Surface

    //  Set the current rendering surface
    EGLBoolean madeCurrent = eglMakeCurrent(egl_display, egl_surface,
        egl_surface, egl_context);
    assert(madeCurrent);  //  Failed to set rendering surface

    //  Render the display
    render_display();

    //  Swap the display buffers to make the display visible
    EGLBoolean swappedBuffers = eglSwapBuffers(egl_display, egl_surface);
    assert(swappedBuffers);  //  Failed to swap display buffers
}
</code></pre>
<p>Functions named <code>wl_egl_...</code> are provided by the Wayland EGL Interface.  Functions named <code>egl...</code> come from the cross-platform <a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/egl.html#:%7E:text=The%20main%20library%20(%20libEGL%20)%20is,directly%20dispatched%20to%20the%20drivers.">Mesa 3D Graphics Library</a>.</p>
<p><em>EGL vs OpenGL... What's the difference?</em></p>
<p>In Wayland, EGL is the Enabler for OpenGL. </p>
<p>Wayland only understands EGL and it will gladly hand us EGL objects... But it's up to us to transform EGL into OpenGL for rendering.</p>
<p>Thus in the code above, we take a Wayland Surface <code>surface</code> and transform it into an EGL Window <code>egl_window</code>...</p>
<pre><code>//  Create an EGL Window from a Wayland Surface 
egl_window = wl_egl_window_create(surface, WIDTH, HEIGHT);
</code></pre>
<p>Then we create an OpenGL Window Surface <code>egl_surface</code> from that EGL Window...</p>
<pre><code>//  Create an OpenGL Window Surface for rendering
egl_surface = eglCreateWindowSurface(egl_display, egl_conf,
    egl_window, NULL);
</code></pre>
<p>And we begin the OpenGL rendering...</p>
<pre><code>//  Set the current rendering surface
eglMakeCurrent(egl_display, egl_surface,
    egl_surface, egl_context);

//  Render the display
render_display();

//  Swap the display buffers to make the display visible
eglSwapBuffers(egl_display, egl_surface);
</code></pre>
<p>Here's how we create a Wayland Region for OpenGL rendering: <a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-mir/blob/master/egl.c#L103-L112"><code>pinephone-mir/egl.c</code></a></p>
<pre><code>static struct wl_region *region;  //  Wayland Region

//  Create the Wayland Region for rendering OpenGL graphics
static void create_opaque_region(void) {
    //  Create a Wayland Region
    region = wl_compositor_create_region(compositor);
    assert(region != NULL);  //  Failed to create EGL Region

    //  Set the dimensions of the Wayland Region
    wl_region_add(region, 0, 0, WIDTH, HEIGHT);

    //  Add the Region to the Wayland Surface
    wl_surface_set_opaque_region(surface, region);
}
</code></pre>
<p>To learn more about EGL, check out <a href="https://jan.newmarch.name/Wayland/EGL/">"Programming Wayland Clients"</a></p>
<p>The Wayland EGL code in this article was adapted from that document.</p>

        <h3>
About</h3>

<p>
Mathematical Components is the name of a library of formalized mathematics for
the Coq system. It covers a variety of topics, from the theory of basic data
structures (e.g., numbers, lists, finite sets) to advanced results in various
flavors of algebra. This library constitutes the infrastructure for the machine
checked proofs of the Four Color Theorem and of the Odd Order Theorem.
</p>
<p>
The reason of existence of this book is to break down the barriers to entry.
While there are several books around covering the usage of the Coq system and
the theory it is based on, the Mathematical Components library is built in an
unconventional way. As a consequence this book provides a non standard
presentation of Coq, putting upfront the formalization choices and the proof
style that are the pillars of the library.
</p>
<p>
This books targets two classes of public. On one hand newcomers, even the more
mathematical inclined ones, find a soft introduction to the programming
language of Coq, <em>Gallina</em>, and the <em>Ssreflect</em> proof language.
On the other hand accustomed Coq users find a substantial account of the
formalization style that made the Mathematical Components library possible.

<p>
	*** The Urban Archeology Program uncovered basalt slab floors corresponding to an open plaza in the Old Houses of Axayácatl, <em>tlatoani</em> of Tenochtitlan between 1469 and 1481.</p>

<p>
	*** INAH’s archaeological salvage project also detected the remains of the conqueror's dwelling, which later became the headquarters of the first Cabildo of New Spain and of the Marquessate of the Valley of Oaxaca.</p>

 

<p>
	Within the walls of the Old Houses of Axayácatl some of the most decisive episodes of the conquest of Mexico-Tenochtitlán occurred, such as the death of the <em>tlatoani</em> Moctezuma Xocoyotzin, possibly on June 29, 1520; unexpected outcomes that undermined the relationship between Mexicans and Spaniards and triggered the open confrontation.</p>

<p>
	The most recent discovery made by specialists from the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH), of vestiges of that pre-Hispanic palace, and of the remains of a later house built under the orders of Hernán Cortés, with reused materials from the previous Tenochca building, revives the memory of those historical events, five centuries later.</p>

<p>
	Thanks to historical sources, it is no mystery for archaeologists that under the floors of the Nacional Monte de Piedad, one of the most emblematic buildings of Mexico City’s Historic Center, located next to the Metropolitan Cathedral, are the foundations of the Palace of Axayácatl, which functioned as the living quarters of Cortés' entourage upon their arrival in the heart of Tenochtitlan.</p>

<p>
	Over the last two decades, and taking advantage of diverse remodeling projects undertaken in the headquarters of that institution, various INAH experts have found remnants of the former residence of Moctezuma II's father. The most recent discoveries were brought to light during archaeological interventions led by Raúl Barrera Rodríguez and José María García Guerrero, head and collaborator, respectively, of the Urban Archeology Program (PAU).</p>

<p>
	Following an inspection for refurbishments conducted in the northern half of the historic building, PAU personnel carried out an archaeological salvage project between the first days of September 2017 and mid-August 2018, focusing on the main courtyard and an adjacent room. It is noteworthy that the project continues to the present in the post-dig research phase.</p>

<p>
	Excavations resulted in the discovery of numerous basalt slab floors, which must have formed part of an open plaza in the Palace of Axayácatl, the ruler who controlled the destiny of Tenochtitlan between 1469 and 1481.</p>

<p>
	Also, from the early Viceregal period (1521-1620 AD), the remains of a house built by order of Cortés were uncovered. That construction, where the Spanish conqueror resided for several years, would also become the seat of the first Cabildo of New Spain (around 1525) and of the Marquessate of the Valley of Oaxaca, granted to the conqueror four years later.</p>

<p>
	<strong>The archaeological investigation</strong></p>

<p>
	As an exciting part of the public outreach program "Contigo en la Distancia” (“With you from a Distance”), from the Ministry of Culture, the head of the PAU, Raúl Barrera, and his collaborator José María García, explain that they dug 12 test pits - 2 meters per side and 1.50 m deep— around the main courtyard of the National Monte de Piedad, where remodeling work was being carried out to reinforce the columns that define the structure and support the first level of the building.</p>

<p>
	By excavating a series of test pits, on the north, east and west sides, the remains of a stone masonry wall - 1.50 meters high by 1.25 m wide - were uncovered. This wall served as a foundation and basal platform for a series of columns of the building erected around 1755, which allows us to deduce that the central courtyard was originally larger. Also, in the west section of this same space were found the subflooring: basal portions and a shaft of other columns from the early Viceregal period.</p>

<p>
	However, major surprises awaited in the adjacent room. PAU archaeologists had the opportunity to conduct an extensive excavation, which allowed them to locate the remains of a room made of basalt and <em>tezontle </em>(vesicular lava) dressed stones - 5 by 4 meters -, whose base sat upon a floor of basalt slabs. Further analyses led to the conclusion that this was the home of Hernán Cortés, once Mexico-Tenochtitlan fell in 1521.</p>

<p>
	Below the subflooring of the house of Cortés, more than 3 meters deep, the remains of another floor of basalt slabs, but from pre-Hispanic times, were detected. Given its characteristics, the specialists deduced that it was part of an open space in the former Palace of Axayácatl, probably a courtyard.</p>

<p>
	Barrera and García emphasize that the vestiges of the nascent Viceregal era correspond to reused materials from the Old Houses of Axayácatl. These premises, like so many other structures of the Sacred Precinct of Tenochtitlan, were destroyed by the Spanish and their indigenous allies, almost to their foundations.</p>

<p>
	As an example of this, embedded in the façade of the southeast interior corner of the colonial room, two pre-Hispanic dressed stones carved with sculptures in high relief were found. They depicted a feathered serpent (Quetzalcóatl) and a headdress of feathers, and must have belonged to a panel of the Palace of Axayácatl. Also, another Mexica sculpture with the glyph that symbolizes the <em>tianquiztli</em> or market was recovered, in its place as part of a shaft.</p>

<p>
	Some of the diagnostic materials, which allow the preliminary dating of these findings, are the remains of pre-Hispanic and colonial pottery, whose types (styles) belong to the aforementioned historical periods: Aztec III: Orange Monochrome, Black-on-Orange and Texcoco Burnished Earthenware; as well as glazed earthenware and Spanish and New Spain majolica.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Old Houses of Axayácatl</strong></p>

<p>
	Raúl Barrera, also a researcher at the INAH Directorate of Salvage Archaeology, reflects on the fact that some material evidence speaks volumes, by its very paucity. Such is the case for the recent discoveries in the National Monte de Piedad, which “speak” of the destruction that the main buildings of Tenochtitlan were subjected to, both for symbolic and practical purposes.</p>

<p>
	Despite the modest nature of the remains, those pre-Hispanic floors were the same ones that the Spanish invaders and their allies tread upon during their arrival to Tenochtitlan, on November 8, 1519. Moctezuma II allowed them to stay in the old houses that had belonged to his father, and soon after they turned them into their barracks.</p>

<p>
	While in that palace, numerous events took place. For example, they remodeled a room to celebrate mass, and right there, they also held various rulers captive, starting with their distinguished host: Moctezuma Xocoyotzin; as well as Cuitláhuac, lord of Iztapalapa; Cacamatzin,<em> tlatoani</em> of Texcoco; and Itzcuauhtzin, lord of Tlatelolco, among others.</p>

<p>
	Following on the massacre during the festival of Tóxcatl that took place at the Templo Mayor (“Great Temple”) on May 22 of 1520, by the order of Pedro de Alvarado, the Spanish withdrew and returned to the Palace of Axayácatl. That incident unleashed the anger of the Mexica and, at the end of June of that year, they besieged the invaders in that building. Hernán Cortés wanted to contain their fury through Moctezuma, who tried to placate them from the roof of the palace. But the efforts were in vain, as his brother Cuitláhuac had already been ordained the new ruler.</p>

<p>
	On the night of June 30, 1520, the Spanish fled to Tlaxcala by the great causeway of Tlacopan (today Tacuba), leaving behind the Old Houses of Axayácatl.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Cortés’ houses</strong></p>

<p>
	After the fall of Tenochtitlan, the surviving Mexicas were forced to destroy, with their own hands, their temples and palaces and build the new city using the same materials. The Old Houses of Axayácatl would gave way to the Houses of Hernán de Cortés, which were also the temporary headquarters of the first Cabildo of New Spain, around 1525, and of the Marquessate of the Valley of Oaxaca, a noble title carrying the responsibility for creating a government, granted in 1529 for his services to the Spanish Crown.</p>

<p>
	Upon the conqueror's death in 1547, his descendants retained ownership. His son Martín Cortés Zúñiga inherited the marquessate, but in 1566 he was involved in a conspiracy that sought to seize the government of New Spain, so he was expelled from the Viceroyalty. The houses and the extensive land remained in the hands of a legal representative and, already in poor condition, were sold to the Sacro Monte de Piedad in 1836.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      

<div>
  
    
      <div><p>In version 3.4, python shipped with a new module in the standard library,  <code>pathlib</code> . At the time of its release, I remember hearing some fanfare around it, but I didn’t quite understand the point of it. I had only recently stopped adding strings together to create paths to the files and folders I needed to work with, in favor of using the  <code>os</code>  and  <code>os.path</code>  modules. It took me a little while to experiment with it and plumb the documentation for useful&nbsp;bits.</p><p>Since then, I’ve learned a lot about the  <code>pathlib</code>  module, and as I have said before, <a href="https://everydaysuperpowers.dev/articles/pathlib-my-new-favorite-module/">it is my favorite module in the standard library</a>.</p><p>While that’s the case, most people I talk to about it are working to hard to access files and folders with python. Many have either not heard about it, or they still don’t understand&nbsp;it.</p><p>They still write code like&nbsp;this:</p></div>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">BASE_FOLDER = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <p><span>OK</span>, so there’s nothing wrong with that code per se, but most pythonistas would agree that your code should be readable. I would argue that  <code>pathlib</code>  could make that line of code more readable<label for="readable"></label><span>One could argue that it’s not necessarily more readable, if you’re not as familiar with it. So maybe I should settle for it being shorter?</span>&nbsp;:</p>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">BASE_FOLDER = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1]</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <div><p>I don’t know what your favorite module is in the standard library<label for="std"></label><span>Though, I would like to know what it is and why!</span> , but I imagine that most people don’t really think about&nbsp;it.</p><p>The reason why  <code>pathlib</code>  is my favorite module is that I have found it to be so very useful. And I really believe it can save you pain and effort in the months and years to&nbsp;come.</p><p>That’s why I created two resources for&nbsp;you.</p><p>The first is what I’m calling a “field guide” to  <code>pathlib</code> . It’s a standalone document, a little longer than one of my blog posts, that will introduce you to the module and some of its features I use the&nbsp;most.</p><p>I have also created a cheat sheet for the module, since there are over 40 useful properties and methods on a  <code>Path</code>  object, and I find that I could use a quick-reference guide to remind me of the ones I don’t use as&nbsp;often.</p><p>Look, I suggest the next time you are going to work with a file or folder, give  <code>pathlib</code>  a&nbsp;try.</p><p>It combines parts of the  <code>os</code> ,  <code>os.path</code> , and  <code>glob</code>  modules (and maybe more) in one useful&nbsp;package.</p></div>


    
  
    
      <h2 id="strings-arent-good-enough">
        <a href="https://everydaysuperpowers.dev/articles/stop-working-so-hard-paths-get-started-pathlib/#strings-arent-good-enough">Strings aren’t good enough</a>
      </h2>
    
  
    
      <div><p>One of the things I love about  <code>pathlib</code>  is that you are now working with an object instead of a&nbsp;string.</p><p>Strings are not the best way to work with data. You can’t ask a string what the name of the file is. Instead, you’ll have to come up with method to break the string apart and harvest that&nbsp;information.</p><p>One way to do that would be to use the  <code>basename</code>  method in the  <code>os.path</code>  module and split the&nbsp;result:</p></div>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">location = '/Users/chris/field_guides/pathlib.html'
file_name = os.path.basename(location).split('.')[0]</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <div><p>That works, but it’s not the most readable. You have to do some mental gymnastics to unpack the four different things that happen in that one line of code. It could be challenging for people who are new to&nbsp;python.</p><p>Instead, you could use a  <code>Path</code>  object:</p></div>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">location = Path('/Users/chris/field_guides/pathlib.html')
file_name = location.stem</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <p>Now, this is what I’m talking about! There’s no mental gymnastics to figure out how to split strings. There’s no having to remember what individual  <code>os.path</code>  methods do. It’s just simply asking an object what one of its properties&nbsp;are.</p>


    
  
    
      <h2 id="express-yourself">
        <a href="https://everydaysuperpowers.dev/articles/stop-working-so-hard-paths-get-started-pathlib/#express-yourself">Express yourself</a>
      </h2>
    
  
    
      <div><p>Since it frees me from directly manipulating strings, I find that  <code>pathlib</code>  allows me to be more expressive with the way I write code that interacts with files and&nbsp;folders.</p><p>I write less code, and my mind feels more able to think about the problem at&nbsp;hand.</p><p>For instance, you can easily reference all of the  <code>json</code>  files in the current&nbsp;folder:</p></div>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">json_files = Path().glob('*.json')</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <p>You can even safely open a file, load its contents, and close it in one&nbsp;line:</p>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">json_files = Path().glob('*.json')
for f in json_files:
    data = json.loads(f.read_text())</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <div><p>Even manipulating paths are easier with&nbsp;pathlib.</p><p>I see many people joining paths by adding strings together, like&nbsp;this:</p></div>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current"># not the best way to manipulate a path
root_folder = 'path/to/content/folder'
config_file = root_folder + 'config/config.json'</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <div><p>While this can work, it’s not the best way to manipulate paths, as this way will break if you ever run your code on a different operating system, as Windows uses back-slashes to denote paths. All other platforms use&nbsp;slashes.</p><p>Also, it’s easy to introduce bugs like I did in that code. I didn’t include a trailing slash in the  <code>root_folder</code>  variable. So the resulting path would look like this, and would probably&nbsp;fail:</p></div>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current"># result of previous code
'path/to/content/folderconfig/config.json'</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <p>The next best way to join paths is to use the  <code>os.path.joinpath</code>  method. This will handle the “bug” I introduced&nbsp;above:</p>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">config_file = os.path.join(root_folder, 'config/config.json')
print(config_file)
'path/to/content/folder/config/config.json'</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <div><p>While this is better, it still doesn’t address the cross-platform&nbsp;issue.</p><p>Thankfully,  <code>pathlib</code>  not only makes it even easier to join paths, but it also allow you to write code that works on every operating&nbsp;system.</p></div>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">root_folder = Path('path/to/content/folder')
config_file = root_folder.joinpath('config/config.json')</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <p>Additionally,  <code>pathlib</code>  gives you the option to write less code when joining paths. This is equivalent to the line&nbsp;above:</p>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">config_file = root_folder / 'config/config.json'</code></pre>

<p>
There's this rather nifty feature of modern web browsers (such as
<b>Firefox</b> or <b>Chrome</b>) where the browser will automatically warn the
user if they happen to navigate to a "<i>malicious</i>" URL:
</p>

<p><img src="https://gopiandcode.uk/images/malicious-site.png" alt="malicious-site.png">
</p> 


<p>
While <i>conceptually</i> simple, this feature actually requires more
engineering effort than one would expect - in particular, tracking the
set of known malicious URLs in a practical manner turns out to be
somewhat difficult.
</p>

<p>
This is because, on one hand, trying to store the database of <i>all</i>
known malicious URLs, which, bear in mind, may contain <i>millions and
millions</i> of entries, is something that is just practically
infeasible for most users. </p><p><img src="https://gopiandcode.uk/images/database_local.png" alt="database_local.png"> </p>


<p>
Conversely, sending <i>every</i> URL that a user visits to some external
service, where it could be <i>logged</i> and <i>data-mined</i> by nefarious
third parties, is something that most users should
probably not be comfortable with.
</p>

<p>
As it turns out, browsers actually implement this functionality by
means of a rather interesting <i>compromise</i><sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
Using a probabilistic data structure known as a <b>Bloom filter</b>,
Browsers maintain a approximate representation of the set of known
malicious URLs locally.  By querying this <i>space-efficient</i> local set,
browsers will only send up a <i>small proportion</i> of the honest URLs.
</p>

<p><b><i>Use a Bloom filter to act as a local proxy for queries to an external database</i>.</b>
</p>


<p>
This proxy technique, which safe-guards the privacy of millions of
users ever day, depends on <b>two key properties</b> of Bloom filters:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>No false negatives</dt><dd>This states that if a query for an URL in the
Bloom filter returns negative, then the queried item can be
guaranteed to not be present in the set of malicious URLs - i.e
<i>the Bloom filter is guaranteed to return a positive result for
all known malicious URLs</i>.</dd>

<dt>Low false positive rate</dt><dd>This property states that for any URL
that is <i>not in the set of malicious</i> URLs, the likelihood of a
Bloom filter query returning a positive result should be <i>fairly
low</i> - thus minimising the number of <i>unnecessary</i> infractions on
user privacy.</dd>
</dl>


<p>
This mechanism works <i>quite</i> well, and the guarantees of a Bloom filter
seem to be perfectly suited for this particular task, however it has
one small problem, and that is:
</p>

<p><b><i>The</i> widely cited expression <i>for the</i> false positive rate <i>of a bloom filter is</i> wrong!</b>
</p>


<p>
In fact, as it turns out, the behaviours of a Bloom filter have
actually been the subject of 30 years of mathematical contention,
requiring <i>multiple</i> corrections and even <i>corrections of these
corrections</i>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Given this history of errors, can we really have any certainty in our
understanding of a Bloom filter at all?</b>
</p>

<p>
Well, <i>never fear</i>, I am writing this post to inform you that we have
just recently used <code>Coq</code> to produce the <i>very first</i> <b>certified</b> proof
of the false positive rate of a Bloom filter, finally putting an end to
this saga of errors and returning certainty (pardon the pun<sup><a id="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>) to a
mechanism that countless people rely on <i>every single</i> day.
</p>

<p>
In the rest of this post, we'll explore the main highlights of this
research, answering the following questions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>What is a Bloom filter?</li>
<li>Why did these errors initially arise?</li>
<li>What is the true behaviour of a Bloom filter? and how can we be certain?</li>
</ul>

Structures", you can find the paper <a href="https://www.springerprofessional.de/en/certifying-certainty-and-uncertainty-in-approximate-membership-q/18186934">here</a>, and a video presentation of

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemprop="articleBody" id="content"><p>If your an engineer you probably spend a lot of time using a terminal.
Some of your best productivity gains will come from understanding it better and making small improvements to repetitive tasks.</p><p>Many people know the basics for default shell shortcuts like Ctrl+a and Ctrl+e to go to the begining and end of a line.
There are also a few keyboard shortcuts you’ve probably found by accident like Ctrl+s, Ctrl+z, or Ctrl+c.</p><p>Here are some keyboard shortcuts I use regularly that you might find helpful too.
I’m focusing on zsh because that’s my preferred interactive shell but many of these shortcuts will work in bash or other shells too.</p><p>If you want more shell tips, check out my mastering zsh workshop <a href="https://github.com/rothgar/mastering-zsh">https://github.com/rothgar/mastering-zsh</a>.</p><p>We’ll start with some basic keyboard shortcuts and get progressivly more advanced.
Many of these shortcuts are default behavior but some will need code added to your configuration to enable them.</p><h3 id="basics">Basics</h3><p>I’m amazed how long it took me to learn these keybord shortcuts and see that people still don’t know them.</p><p><code>Ctrl+r</code>: Reverse search through your command history.
Kinda like pushing the up arrow with search.</p><p><code>Ctrl+c</code>: kill/interupt the current running process.
If you don’t want it to print <code>^C</code> every time you press it you can add <code>set echo-control-characters Off</code> to your <code>~/.inputrc</code> file.</p><p><code>Ctrl+d</code>: Close your current terminal.
Same as typing <code>exit</code> but way shorter.</p><p><code>Ctrl+l</code>: clear the screen.
Similar, but slightly different, to typing <code>clear</code>.</p><p><code>Ctrl+z</code>: Suspend process.
This is really helpful if you’re in your editor and you need to run a command real quick.
Instead of opening a new terminal press <code>ctrl+z</code>, run your command, and then type <code>fg</code> to bring the command back to the foreground.</p><h3 id="delete-word-behind-your-cursor">Delete word behind your cursor</h3><p>If you have a command typed out or selected from your history with Ctrl+r you probably want to change one or two words from it.</p><p>First you can move your cursor back a word with <code>Alt+b</code>.
Press it multiple times to keep moving back.</p><p>Once your cursor is at the end of the word you need to change/delete press <code>Ctrl+w</code> to delete it.
If it doesn’t delete up to the characters you expect try setting your <code>$WORDCHARS</code> variable to characters that should be considered part of the word.</p><h3 id="don-t-repeat-your-whole-arguments">Don’t repeat your whole arguments</h3><p>If you need to move a file to something like a $FILE.bak you can do that easily with <code>{,}</code>.</p><p>Don’t do this</p><pre><code>cp ~/this-is/my-long-file/name.txt ~/this-is/my-long-file/name.txt.bak
</code></pre><p>Do this</p><pre><code>cp ~/this-is/my-long-file/name.txt{,.bak}
</code></pre><p>It works anywhere in the command too!
This will copy name.txt into new-folder (assuming it exists).</p><pre><code>cp ~/this-is/{my-long-file,new-folder}/name.txt
</code></pre><h3 id="enter-last-argument-from-previous-command-s">Enter last argument from previous command(s)</h3><p>There is a default shell variable <code>$?</code> which represents the last argument from the preceeding command (e.g. <code>echo $?</code>)
<code>Ctrl+.</code> is the keyboard shortcut to do the same thing.
Not only is it easier to type but you can push it multiple times to cycle through the last argument from previous commands.</p><h3 id="prepend-sudo">Prepend sudo</h3><p>I need this a lot.
You type out a command or find it from your history and need to run it with sudo but forgot it at the begining of the line.
Normally you would <code>Ctrl+a</code> type <code>sudo</code> then <code>Ctrl+e</code>.
This shortcuts does all that with a single shortcut.</p><p>Add this code snippet to your .zshrc
I prefer <code>esc, s</code> for the keyboard shortcut because it works well in vim mode and doesn’t clobber the default <code>Ctrl+s</code> shortcut.</p><pre><code># add sudo before command with esc, s
function prepend-sudo() {
  [[ -z $BUFFER ]] &amp;&amp; zle up-history
  if [[ $BUFFER == sudo\ * ]]; then
    LBUFFER="${LBUFFER#sudo }"
  else
    LBUFFER="sudo $LBUFFER"
  fi
}
zle -N prepend-sudo
# shortcut keys: [Esc] [s]
bindkey "\es" prepend-sudo
</code></pre><p><img src="https://github.com/rothgar/mastering-zsh/raw/master/img/prepend-sudo.gif" alt=""></p><p>If you’re using oh-my-zsh you can add the <a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/plugins/sudo/sudo.plugin.zsh#L32">sudo plugin</a> and the default key binding is <code>esc, esc</code>.</p><h3 id="open-command-in-editor">Open command in $EDITOR</h3><p>There is a really handy command <code>fc</code> which will open your last command in your $EDITOR.
It’s great for long or multi-line command edits.</p><p>There are lots of other ways to accomplish editing the last command you can check out <a href="https://github.com/rothgar/mastering-zsh/blob/master/docs/config/history.md#modifying-the-last-command">here</a>.</p><p>To edit your current command in your editor add this snippet to your .zshrc</p><pre><code>autoload -U edit-command-line
zle -N edit-command-line
# shortcut key: [Esc] [v]
bindkey "\ev" edit-command-line
</code></pre><p><img src="https://github.com/rothgar/mastering-zsh/raw/master/img/fc-example.gif" alt=""></p><p>Now next time you copy/paste a multi-line command from somewhere it’ll be easy to edit.</p><h3 id="cut-current-line-and-then-paste-it-on-your-next-prompt">Cut current line and then paste it on your next prompt</h3><p>If you need to run a command before the command you currently have typed you can cut/yank it and then paste/pop it at your next prompt with yank-pop.
This gif explains it better.</p><p><img src="https://github.com/rothgar/mastering-zsh/raw/master/img/push-input.gif" alt=""></p><p>In zsh this is called <code>push-line-or-edit</code> and it’s a default widget you can enable with.</p><pre><code>bindkey '^q' push-line-or-edit
</code></pre><p>A bonus feature is your cursor line will be in the same place after the command is pasted to the new prompt.</p></article></div>]]>

<![CDATA[A Vote for Younger Presidents]]>

<p>Historically, US Presidents have entered the White House at a <a href="https://t.co/v8DD3uCI85?amp=1">median age of 55</a>. </p>



<p>Trump was the oldest ever to become president. If he is re-elected and serves a full second term, he would become the oldest sitting president of all-time (surpassing Reagan in his second term). If Biden is elected, he would become the oldest sitting president of all-time too, on his first day. </p>



<p>We are going the wrong way.</p>



<p>Bernie and Bloomberg were even older than Biden. Warren would have been older than Trump upon election. Of the 7 candidates who won at least 1 delegate in the Democratic Primary, 4 were in their 70s, 1 was in her 60s, and 2 were in their 30s. Isn’t it odd that none of them were in their 40s or 50s? It seems that the ages of our presidential candidate’s are becoming as polarized as their politics. There is no one in the middle! I want a middle candidate for president in terms of both age and politics.</p>



<p>In terms of approximating an appropriate age, 40s and 50s seem like a reasonable range. Cognitive function is certainly not all that makes a good president but it would seem to be a significant factor. According to a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614567339?casa_token=L29u1CmuY6gAAAAA%3AHwbJVxHMdjeQxoe1A1UcjnE-sTEy1YhbSyhlQic62On1RpUMpAd0JKWh7H2IvB3tj5dmN8nw2g4x&amp;journalCode=pssa">study </a>in Psychological Science, it does not look like anything good happens after 55. Of course, there is something to be said for growing wiser with age and other good arguments of that nature which are totally valid. I should clarify that when I say that nothing good happens after 55, I am stricly speaking in scientific terms of cognitive function for the average person. No offense to my elders (and sorry for calling you elders).</p>

<p>There are other studies that suggest the best age for decision-making and leadership tends to be during a person’s 50s. Of course, there are many exceptions. This is not an exact science applicable to every person by any means. Still, it seems like reasonable enough support to justify a solid range in which being too young or too old should almost never be an issue.</p>



<p>Politics completely aside, the age range of recent candidates like Yang (45), O’Rourke (47), Cruz (49), Rubio (49), Booker (51), and Harris (55) seems to be an appropriate one. They are all between 45 and 55 which presents an even narrower ranger than what I previously defined as 40s and 50s. Again, I am not saying that this is a range that our president needs to be within by any means, but it seem like a good age range to be within nonetheless. I may have issues with any or all of these candidates listed above but in no case are any of my top concerns in any way related to their ages. Same goes for Kanye (43).</p>



<p>It is helpful also to think about the best leaders our world has to offer outside of politics. I think it is safe to assume that the most successful companies tend to have some of the most successful CEOs.</p>



<p>Here are the ages of the CEOs of the 7 largest companies in the world:</p>



<ul><li>Microsoft’s Satya Nadella (52) </li><li>Apple’s Tim Cook (59) </li><li>Amazon’s Jeff Bezos (56) </li><li>Alphabet’s Sundar Pichai (47) </li><li>Alibaba’s Daniel Zhang  (48) </li><li>Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg (36) </li><li>Tencent’s Ma Huateng (48) </li></ul>



<p>The median age of those world-leading CEOs is 48 and the average is 50. Let us add Elon Musk into the mix for good measure. The man who is revolutionizing the auto industry and sending Americans to space is 48. Coincidentally, I would argue the president should be leading bothing of those efforts.</p>



<p>The point I am making is that we should not be debating the mental fitness of our candidates based on age. That does not mean that I would never vote for someone in their 70s. I just wish I had an electable option not to. Candidates in their early 30s and late 60s generally seem a bit young and old to me for the role of president, respectively, but I would certainly vote for the right candidate at 35 or 65, and even someone in their 80s if that individual candidate seemed great to me. I do not want to be written off as an ageist for having written this and if that is not a term yet I am sure that it will be soon. Just because I would generally want my football team’s quarterback to be in his 20s or early 30s doesn’t mean I would not prefer Tom Brady in his 40’s to most of the other quarterbacks in the league. It seems to me that 40s and 50s are good years of age to be had by the person in the most powerful position in the world, The President of the United States of America. </p>
