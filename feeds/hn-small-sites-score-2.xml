September 3, 2020 | https://blog.bearer.sh/api-debugging-tools/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.bearer.sh/api-debugging-tools/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Integrating with APIs can be challenging. Each with its own <a href="https://blog.bearer.sh/best-practices-for-navigating-api-documentation/">documentation format</a>, SDK patterns, and authentication quirks. Once you get the integration up and running, the harder step is testing and debugging any problems. This part can be exploratory—before you finish building—or as part of problem resolution.</p>
<p>While you can certainly debug within your codebase, by testing methods and reviewing logs, it can be beneficial to isolate the API calls by using one of the many API testing tools available.</p>
<p>Rather than list the pros and cons of each, let's focus on what makes each tool unique and worth trying.</p>
<h2 id="postman">Postman</h2>
<p>Cost: Free + Paid Plans</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/postman.png" alt="postman"></p>
<p><a href="https://postman.com/">Postman</a> is an institution in this space. It's been around for years, and went from a small app that made API calls into the full ecosystem that it is today. While Postman's primary use case is building and managing your own APIs, their emphasis on encouraging third-parties to publish collections has made it a great tool for exploring and debugging web services. These collections are what make Postman a fantastic tool for debugging external API calls.</p>
<p>Some providers, like Zendesk, <a href="https://developer.zendesk.com/rest_api/docs/sunshine/custom_objects_api">link directly to their Postman collections</a> in their documentation. Others can be found on Postman's <a href="https://explore.postman.com/">Explore</a> page, and then opened within the Postman app. Once installed, you can explore endpoints and resources with minimal setup.</p>
<p><a href="https://postman.com/">Learn more about Postman</a>.</p>
<h2 id="hoppscotch">Hoppscotch</h2>
<p>Cost: Free</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/hoppscotch.png" alt="hoppscotch"></p>
<p><a href="https://hoppscotch.io/">Hoppscotch</a> started as a faster, browser-first alternative to Postman, called Postwoman. It has since been rebranded and continues to add features. Its main benefits are speed and availability. It is also <a href="https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch">open source</a>, and can even run as a browser extension or progressive web app (PWA).</p>
<p><a href="https://hoppscotch.io/">Learn more about Hoppscotch</a>.</p>
<h2 id="paw">Paw</h2>
<p>Cost: Free Trial, then $49.99</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/paw.png" alt="paw"></p>
<p>Moving on to platform-specific applications, <a href="https://paw.cloud/">Paw</a> is a paid Mac application for interacting with APIs. Like many of the others, it's core focus is on providing a tool to build, test, and document your own APIs. Perhaps Paw's greatest selling point is the UI. Compared to many of the other application's on this list, it really feels like quality Mac-first software. It also offers Team functionality, and an interesting feature called Pawprint that lets you share request/response pairs via a URL, even if the receiver doesn't use Paw.</p>
<p><a href="https://paw.cloud/">Learn more about Paw</a>.</p>
<h2 id="insomnia">Insomnia</h2>
<p>Cost: Free + Paid plans.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/insomnia.png" alt="insomnia"></p>
<p><a href="https://insomnia.rest/">Insomnia</a> is another API client that lets you design, debug, and test APIs. Unlike some of the other "all-inclusive" applications, Insomnia splits the API designer functionality into a seperate app. This makes the UI much more approachable, and makes it easier to quickly try out a new request without excess setup and configuration.</p>
<p>One additional tool that you can find in their documentation is a CLI version called Inso. It allows you to use the functionality from both their core Insomnia client as well as the designer app, right from the command line, and even from within CI/CD environments.</p>
<p><a href="https://insomnia.rest/">Learn more about Insomnia</a>.</p>
<h2 id="fiddler">Fiddler</h2>
<p>Cost: Free + Paid plans</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/fiddler.png" alt="fiddler"></p>
<p>While the rest of the applications in this list are centered around allowing you to directly interface with APIs, <a href="https://www.telerik.com/fiddler">Fiddler</a> takes a different approach. It is more of a general purpose web debugging tool. It acts as a proxy to capture local requests between your device and the internet. This means you can run your application locally, and inspect any outgoing requests and incoming responses from the Fiddler application.</p>
<p>This approach can be useful for live-debugging, but it also allows you to mock requests and responses that match specific rules. Combined with features around creating collections of requests and responses, and the ability to collaborate with a team, this approach could really help debugging more complex API problems.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telerik.com/fiddler">Learn more about Fiddler</a></p>

<p>Cost: Free + Paid plans</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/http-toolkit.png" alt="http-toolkit"></p>
<p><a href="https://httptoolkit.tech/">HTTP Toolkit</a> is another proxy-style tool like Fiddler, but it is much easier to use and allows you to target specific apps and devices. Where I had trouble getting Fiddler to recognize calls made from my terminal, HTTP Toolkit just worked immediately. The Pro plans offer some really interesting features, such as modifying calls as they are sent, simulating timeouts, and simulating connection failures. In a lot of ways, it feels like the browser's "Network" panel, but for any application.</p>
<p>There's clearly a goal of developer productivity, shown through small touches like inline documentation for status codes and headers, as well as the ability to export code for the API call itself in a variety of languages. It's also open source, which is always a nice bonus.</p>
<p><a href="https://httptoolkit.tech/">Learn more about HTTP Toolkit</a></p>
<h2 id="bearer">Bearer</h2>
<p>Cost: Free + Paid plans</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bearer.sh/">Bearer</a> takes a different approach, in that it monitors APIs from within your application with minimal code changes. Any common issues are detected and collected in the dashboard, but you can also set up custom rules for edge case problems. This is a great way to actively debug, but also passively keep watch for unexpected problems that may arise with web services.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/bearer.png" alt="bearer"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.bearer.sh/">Learn more about Bearer</a></p>

<p>Choosing the right tool, not just for the task, but also for your workflow can be a challenge. Fortunately, all of the options we've looked at here are free or offer free trials to get you started. Whether you're doing some exploratory testing, debugging a rare problem, or looking for a way to make your integrations more reliable, there's an existing API debugging and testing tool that can help.</p>

<article>
  

    <section>
      <p>I recently read a somehow controversial <a href="https://iism.org/article/why-are-ceos-failing-software-engineers-56">article</a> on why CEOs are failing software engineers. In the article, software management theorist <a href="https://twitter.com/GeneTBond">Gene Bond</a> argues that since business-educated CEOs only learn about financial and business management, they can't understand the creative management necessary to discover and realise new works of value.</p><blockquote>"<em>New value is a function of failure, not success; and, much of software engineering is about discovering new value. So, in effect, nearly everything [they] are taught as a business major or leader is seemingly incompatible with software engineering.</em>"</blockquote><p>But what if CEOs were former software engineers? Would they still fail the software engineers they lead? Data seems to show otherwise when you know that eight of the ten <a href="https://fxssi.com/most-valuable-tech-companies">most valuable technology companies</a> have <strong>CEOs who also are engineers</strong>. Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world, was exposed to tech and coding at a <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/1058012110947373057?s=20">young age</a>. Bill Gates, the second richest, fell in love with programming at <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Early-Days-as-a-Computer-Programmer">13 years old</a>, and Mark Zuckerberg, famously kept coding Facebook while being CEO for years. Still, the majority of software engineers think they can only become CTO and have little interest in business.</p><h3 id="top-performing-ceos-have-engineering-degrees"><strong>Top-performing CEOs have engineering degrees</strong></h3><p>Every year since 2014, the Harvard Business Review has published an <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/11/the-ceo-100-2019-edition#the-best-performing-ceos-in-the-world-2019">annual ranking</a> of the best-performing CEOs in the world and, for the past three years, there have been <strong>more CEOs with engineering degrees than MBAs</strong>, including this year's number one, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang. One likely explanation for this trend is the increase of technology CEOs on the list, as the industry has seen exponential growth in recent years. But maybe there's something else.</p><p>First of all, software engineers know how to set up the right environment for fellow developers because, well, they've been there. They know what developers <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/09/07/a-field-guide-to-developers/">look for in a job</a>. It's not surprising that <strong>twelve out of the twenty tech CEOs most favoured by their </strong><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Award/Top-CEOs-LST_KQ0,8.htm"><strong>employees</strong></a><strong> have an engineering background</strong> or coded at some point in their careers. As Stack Overflow and Trello founder Joel Sposkly <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/07/25/hitting-the-high-notes/">puts it</a>: "<em>building the company where the best software developers in the world would want to work [leads] to profits as naturally as chocolate leads to chubbiness or cartoon sex in video games leads to gangland-style shooting sprees</em>". After all, he did build two multi-million companies that considerably impacted the software ecosystem.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oPXEuhoN05pnwuxbStZyMOftjkpqzRkpZdIxi2KImveOn3p8CL0VOEr7OGcuXQjFr0_MsfHaGx4QJ9ps3JSHJd8TXpv7dSUypZTTqf0jURKiGppNFiGi4aXfiLGbiJ9xBZAa6UwD" alt=""><figcaption>Joel Spolsky’s formula on how to build profitable software companies</figcaption></figure><p>I also believe that having a software engineering mindset, even if self-taught, allows CEOs to manage their companies very differently than financially focused peers.</p><h3 id="approaching-business-processes-like-programming-tasks"><strong>Approaching business processes like programming tasks</strong></h3><p>While Microsoft valuation hardly moved during Steve Ballmer's fourteen years tenure as CEO, it grew over 200 % since Satya Nadella took over in 2014. The difference? Steve Ballmer was a sales-oriented business school drop-out, while Nadella is a former software engineer turned executive.<br></p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/SCzxw685G5KsYSWFfNKU1WiU6J7yXXk1nZ-ZBMh-LpSe4gqKLKHwrLT6KCWZJl9bI2E7QHnssM1gCdMRRDVAuabgxYCNn9lQ9xLnbkSNTJ7vgMIhDM7sJecme7mGO_Wqhgxdatg4" alt=""><figcaption>Microsoft stock price under Satya Nadella - CB Insights<span>‌‌</span></figcaption></figure><p>So what does Nadella, and other engineers-turned-CEOs have in common? Well, suppose we take aside the ability to understand technology and have a long-term vision about it. In that case, I believe one of their key attributes is the ability to <strong>approach business processes like programming tasks</strong>.</p><p>Do you know what programmatic marketing, growth hacking and the lean startup have in common? They're all business methodologies that were created by engineers. They leverage <strong>logic and processes</strong> instead of intuition; they're <strong>data-driven</strong> and promote <strong>iterative experimentation</strong>. And, when you go beyond the buzzwords and watch the results, they're behind the wild success of tech companies like Dropbox and Slack (whose CEOs are, by the way, former developers).</p><p>Another trait of software engineers is their inclination to <strong>automate recurring and tedious tasks</strong>. As Bill Gates is known to say, "<em>I always choose a lazy person to do a hard job, because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it.</em>" And software engineers are known to be lazy. So, as CEOs, they're more likely to look for scalable solutions through automation, rather than merely hiring more human beings. Some CEOs take this thinking to another level like GitLab CEO Sid Sijbrandij, who started the company's famous <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/">handbook</a> because he didn't want to repeat himself for every batch of new hires.</p><p>What's even more interesting is when software engineers become CEOs of non-software companies. In this case, they run their firm like a software company, <strong>making software the cornerstone of their strategy</strong>, like Elon Musk with Tesla. One key component of electric automaker Tesla's success, as <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/02/lessons-from-teslas-approach-to-innovation">spotted</a> by Nathan Furr and Jeff Dyer, is that "<em>it introduced a new hardware and software architecture. For example, a Tesla has more software than the average vehicle and it is integrated around a single central software architecture. Although most gas-powered cars have software too, they typically have less software and operate on a different architecture making it more challenging to imitate Tesla's ability to update software and optimise vehicle performance.</em></p><p>Last but not least, they understand like Jeff Bezos that "<em>failure and invention are inseparable twins.</em>" In his famous <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312516530910/d168744dex991.htm">letters to shareholders</a>, Bezos often shares that what makes Amazon successful is their ability to accept the failed experiments necessary to get to invention.</p><blockquote>“<em>Outsized returns often come from betting against conventional wisdom, and conventional wisdom is usually right. Given a ten percent chance of a 100 times payoff, you should take that bet every time. But you’re still going to be wrong nine times out of ten [...] In business, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, you can score 1,000 runs.</em>”</blockquote><h3 id="why-so-few-software-engineers-want-to-become-ceos"><strong>Why so few software engineers want to become CEOs</strong></h3><p>So if software engineers can become excellent CEOs, even in non-tech businesses, why so few of them make it to the top? According to a 2019 Forbes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimberlywhitler/2019/10/05/new-ceo-study-the-undergraduate-degrees-and-majors-of-fortune-100-ceos/#623b360e4130">study</a>, still, 64% of F100 CEOs had a business-related undergraduate degree. I don't think it's just about software engineers' dislike for business. I believe it's also about how few of them consider the CEO position as a career choice. They're always told that if they're interested in management, the highest possible job is CTO. When hiring software engineers for a startup job, they first think they should be CTO.</p><figure><img src="https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/2020/09/image.png" alt=""></figure><p>Of course, not everyone wants to start a startup, the surest way to become CEO. But with more and more tech CEOs <strong>promoted from within after technology management roles</strong>, it's a choice to consider.</p><h3 id="summary"><strong>Summary</strong></h3><ul><li>CEOs with a background in financial and business management often fail to understand software engineers</li><li>Former software engineers and self-taught developers make excellent CEO</li><li>One of their key attributes is their capacity to approach business like programming</li><li>CEO is a valid career choice for software engineers and they shouldn’t be afraid to consider it if they’re attracted to the business side</li></ul><h3 id="reading-list"><strong>Reading List</strong></h3><p>[ARTICLE] <a href="https://iism.org/article/why-are-ceos-failing-software-engineers-56"><strong>Why are CEOs failing software engineers?</strong></a> - &nbsp;Gene Bond</p><p>[ARTICLE] <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/07/25/hitting-the-high-notes/"><strong>Hitting the High Notes</strong></a> - Joel Spolsky</p><p>[ARTICLE] <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/02/lessons-from-teslas-approach-to-innovation"><strong>Lessons from Tesla’s Approach to Innovation</strong></a> - Nathan Furr and Jeff Dyer</p>

                <div>
                    <p>One of the issues I discovered while playing with microk8s Kubernetes setup locally was that many services and tools like <code>Kubernetes Dashboard</code> uses HTTPS for access and I don't want to use Self-Signed SSL certificates as it would require me installing these certificates in every device I use which would be a pain in the butt. So I was on the journey finding a way to have an SSL Certificate for my internal IP addresses. This article will document my journey of getting automatic SSL certificates for my internal microk8s Kubernetes setup.</p><h2 id="ssl-certificate-for-internal-ip-address">SSL Certificate for internal IP address?</h2><p>My first question was is there a way to get an SSL certificate from Public trusted Certificate Authority after looking at many free services like Let's Encrypt and similar services don't provide certificates to IP addresses, but only to domain names.</p><p>After discovering the issue with no way to get an SSL certificate for internal IP I was looking into other options for my problem. After racking my brains for a few minutes I had a question: Could I create a DNS A record for internal IP and would it work? A quick visit to my DNS control panel adding A record to the local IP address and visiting the domain name and seeing my local IP address served website I was amazed that it worked.</p><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image.png 600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image.png 1000w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image.png 1212w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-1.png" alt=""></figure><p>Discovering that I can have a domain name for internal IP working I was surprised now I had curiosity if I will be able to use service like Let's Encrypt to generate an SSL Certificate for this domain name but if I remember correctly the Let's Encrypt requires external access to verify domain name ownership. Hmm, maybe there is a way to verify domain name ownership without external access? After some digging around Let's Encrypt documentation, I found that there many ways to verify domain ownership one of them is DNS plugins which have many DNS providers to automatically verify domains by modifying DNS records using API from those providers. In my case it is DigitalOcean.</p><p>Following <code>certbot-dns-digitalocean</code> <a href="https://certbot-dns-digitalocean.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">documentation</a>I tried to generate a certificate for internal IP but I ran into the issue that default macOS <code>certbot</code> installation from <code>brew install certbot</code> had no <code>certbot-dns-digitalocean</code> plugin available.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>After a quick search online I found that DNS Plugins are not installed by default with <code>certbot</code>.

Now I can try to migrate this knowledge to integrate this to microk8s local setup.</p><h2 id="integrating-let-s-encrypt-with-dns-challenge-into-microk8s-setup-using-cert-manager">Integrating Let's Encrypt with DNS challenge into microk8s setup using <code>cert-manager</code></h2><p>I am not going to describe microk8s Kubernetes setup as it is pretty straightforward compared to the plain Kubernetes setup.</p><p>The first step is to install <code>cert-manager</code> I will be using Helm to install it.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Now let's configure Certificate Issuer.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="1"><span>Need to know</span></h2><div><p>â€˜Just a second. I just need to respond to this one thing,â€™ I said to my daughter, as I attended to my iPhone.</p>
<p>Only much later could I count the mistakes in that statement. No, it wouldnâ€™t take â€˜just a secondâ€™; no, I didnâ€™t â€˜needâ€™ to respond to the email â€“ Iâ€™m an author and researcher, and thus rarely receive messages that have a drop-everything-and-answer urgency to them. And no, it wouldnâ€™t be â€˜one thingâ€™. My brain would be too tempted, Iâ€™d feast on it all.</p>
<p>After I finished, I looked up and my daughter was gone. The worst part: before I became distracted, we had been playing a lovely game, telling each other what superpower we most wished for. It could have brought us closer together, but Iâ€™d just blown the spirit and substance of it big-time.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re a parent in the 21st century, I bet youâ€™ve experienced your own version of this. But itâ€™s not just parents, itâ€™s all of us in our interactions with each other. Distraction has become the norm. Weâ€™re blessed with pocket-sized supercomputers that connect us to anyone and everyone, and a buffet of information. But thereâ€™s a dark side: those same gadgets distract us, often at the moments that matter most.</p>
<p>Of course, smartphones didnâ€™t invent distraction â€“ theyâ€™re just the latest culprit. Before that, we blamed television. And before that, it was the telephone, or comic books, or the radio. Go back more than 2,000 years, and Socrates was even criticising the written word, for causing â€˜forgetfulness in the learnersâ€™ soulsâ€™.</p>
<p>Still, our present feels different, with the sources of distraction seeming greater in number and more ubiquitous. One <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0013916514539755">study</a> in 2014 showed that when two people are talking, the mere presence of a smartphone resting on a table is enough to change the character of their conversation. Thatâ€™s a tame example. To see the seriousness of the problem, look at the sobering <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/distracted-driving">statistics</a> on â€˜distracted drivingâ€™ in the United States.</p>
<p>After I abandoned my daughter and our game for an utterly inconsequential email, I realised I needed to deal with my distraction problem. First, I tried a popular approach: I blamed technology and made a serious attempt at a â€˜digital detoxâ€™. I bought a flip phone, subscribed to a print newspaper, and even purchased a 1990s-era word processor without an internet connection. I convinced myself that, once I banished all the technology from my life, Iâ€™d become the disciplined writer and focused father Iâ€™d always strived to be.</p>
<p>Talk about a rude awakening. Sitting at my ancient word processor, my eyes began to peer over to my now-tantalising bookshelf. â€˜Hmmm,â€™ I said to myself, â€˜I really should take a glance at this bookâ€™. Iâ€™d justify the distraction as necessary for â€˜researchâ€™. And if it wasnâ€™t reading, then Iâ€™d find something else â€“ the laundry that <em>needed</em> to be folded right now, my desk that <em>needed</em> to be tidied-up this minute. The technology wasnâ€™t distracting me. <em>I</em> was distracting me.</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s when I started a five-year journey to understand <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/distractions/">distraction</a>, its causes and its cures. I discovered a great deal that I found surprising and counterintuitive, and I developed methods to deal with my distraction that actually worked â€“ and didnâ€™t involve me trying to turn back time and operate a flip phone. I realised that distraction often begins from within, not without, and found that the fix came from identifying and managing the psychological discomfort that leads us off track.</p>
<p>As often as not, distraction is your brain ducking challenging feelings such as boredom, loneliness, insecurity, fatigue and uncertainty. These are the internal triggers â€“ the <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/kids-video-game-obsession/">root causes</a> â€“ that prompt you to find the comfort of distraction and open a browser tab, Twitter or email, instead of focusing on the matter at hand. Once you identify these internal triggers, you can decide to respond in a more advantageous manner. You wonâ€™t always be able to control how you feel â€“ but you can learn to control how you react to the way you feel. A trigger that once sent you to Twitter can perhaps lead instead to 10 deep breaths.</p>
<p>Distraction, in other words, is a symptom of a problem â€“ not the problem itself. Those deeper and systemic reasons â€“ such as an inability to cope with fear, anxiety or stress â€“ deserve our concern, because itâ€™s only when we start to address them that we can make real progress. When we begin to understand what weâ€™re trying to avoid by clicking over to Twitter or checking the news for the 10th time today, we can begin to address the issue itself, and not medicate it through more distraction. We also begin to appreciate how habitual the act of avoiding discomfort via distraction can be, and how much itâ€™s become a part of how we work and live.</p>
<p>The good news is that thereâ€™s something paradoxical about discomfort: itâ€™s actually the best tool we have for evolving and developing as a species. Feeling bad isnâ€™t actually bad; itâ€™s what helped us survive. Writing in 2001, the American psychologist Roy Baumeister and his colleagues <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-70020-001">observed</a>: â€˜If satisfaction and pleasure were permanent, there might be little incentive to continue seeking further benefits or advances.â€™ If we didnâ€™t feel bad, in other words, weâ€™d never achieve good.</p>
<p>Once you understand the depth of distraction, you can start to manage it and improve. After years of experiments, I found myself less distracted â€“ a quality that improved nearly every aspect of my life. It turns out that being able to focus on the subjects and people in my life who matter improved everything from my health to my happiness to my productivity. That can seem obvious, but I couldnâ€™t have fully appreciated the joys of living an indistractable life if I hadnâ€™t gotten there on my own after a five-year journey. Being indistractable can lead you to not just change your life for the better, but also experience life fully.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p><strong>Self-explore</strong></p>
<p>Identifying the triggers that made you feel bad in the first place requires self-exploration. When you notice yourself feeling distracted, pause and ask yourself what youâ€™re feeling. Are you worried? Are you afraid? Then go one step deeper. What caused the sensation? How does it feel in your body?</p>
<p>In exploring my own internal triggers, I began to appreciate that my anxiety about a project, which might lead me to find a tempting Wikipedia rabbit hole, was actually adaptive: the fact that I was anxious was good because it meant I was trying to become better. It was sometimes even as easy as saying to myself: â€˜Youâ€™re getting distracted right now because youâ€™re worried this wonâ€™t be up to snuff. Thatâ€™s okay. It means youâ€™re trying to do your best work, and thatâ€™s something to feel good about.â€™ It seems like a simple mental trick, but even that thought can have a profound influence in keeping you on track.</p>
<p>Thereâ€™s an interesting paradox about internal triggers: they can be big, imposing, powerful issues, and yet the fixes can sometimes be easy and quick. Hereâ€™s an example: letâ€™s say that an internal trigger when youâ€™re about to get started on a looming project is boredom. You just canâ€™t bring yourself to get excited about doing your taxes. And because you get bored, you get distracted. But if you know youâ€™re going to get bored, you can find ways to avoid the distraction that will soothe the boredom. For instance, if you set a time limit to work on the otherwise mind-numbing task that is so short, you wonâ€™t have a chance to get bored. Anyone can work on their taxes for just 10 minutes. This is called the <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/strange-sex-habits-of-silicon-valley/">10-minute rule</a>, and itâ€™s an effective way to avoid distractions of all sorts. The point is to anticipate the internal trigger and then intercept it with a new routine rather than allowing yourself to slink away into doing something you didnâ€™t intend to do.</p>
<p>In the case of my interaction with my daughter, the internal trigger might have been anxiety about work or <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/fomo/">fear of missing out</a> (on an email). But I can address both of those proactively, so that they donâ€™t interfere with precious daddy-daughter time. In the case of my work anxiety, I could make sure that someone on my team is monitoring incoming messages. I could put up an â€˜out of officeâ€™ email that encourages people to call me if thereâ€™s really an emergency. Or in reality, I could get comfortable with the discomfort that I might indeed be missing out on something, but thatâ€™s all right too. Any one of those is a better and more constructive response to the internal trigger than being distracted.</p>
<p>Whatever approach you take to address your inner triggers, itâ€™s encouraging to note that merely recognising uncomfortable feelings and identifying them could be beneficial. For instance, in a smoking-cessation <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0376871611002535?via%3Dihub">study</a>, researchers found that participants who learned to acknowledge and explore their cravings managed to quit smoking at double the rates of those in the American Lung Associationâ€™s best-performing cessation programme. Just identifying and investigating a craving had a tremendous impact.</p>
<p><strong>Reframe</strong></p>
<p>Once youâ€™ve identified the triggers, you can reframe the task at hand. Sure, you might be â€˜forced to do your taxesâ€™. But another way of thinking about that is that you â€˜get to review last yearâ€™s business successesâ€™. It sounds laughable, but it works. When I hit rough patches mid-book writing, I would say: â€˜I get to share this with my audience,â€™ as opposed to: â€˜I really have to work on the book today.â€™</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s one strategy: I found the fun in whatever I was doing. Yes, I know, this is where you roll your eyes, but hear me out. I learned to stay focused on the tedious work of writing books by looking for and finding the mystery embedded in my work. I wasnâ€™t â€˜writingâ€™, I was â€˜exploringâ€™. I wasnâ€™t Ernest Hemingway; I was Scooby-Doo. Research indicates that even the simple act of thinking of something that you donâ€™t enjoy as …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

So this led to a surge in “digital credit” banking led by the private sector in low-income countries, which is increasing financial inclusion for people without formal credit.</p><p>China takes this up a notch with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.smartcitylab.com/blog/inclusive-sharing/can-big-data-eradicate-poverty/" target="_blank">a cloud computing platform to monitor the financial health of 6 million people living in poverty in 9,000 villages in Guizhou province</a>.

The problem that MEANS is attempting to solve is the mismatch of food between what food kitchens and charities need, and what is being given to them.</p><p>For example, 10,000 packets of sugar-laden Pop-Tarts are given to a charity with mostly diabetic members. In cases where large amounts of the wrong food are given to the wrong people, the food end up being disposed and that sucks.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the most anticipated general public neurotech events of the year happened last Friday: Neuralink’s second yearly update. Although last week was a particularly eventful one for neuroscience, with major announcements from multiple key players in the field, Elon Musk commands a level of attention unlike anyone else (warranted or not). So today we’ll focus on Neuralink and the technology they unveiled.
</p><p>
<b>The Neuralink system</b><br>
The system Neuralink presented during Friday's event is an evolution of the system they unveiled a year ago. Instead of implanting a single array of rigid electrodes into the brain, as is more common, their system inserts individual threads using a device reminiscent of a sewing machine. Indeed, a significant share of their efforts has been geared towards building a medical robot (i.e. the sewing machine) capable of quickly and precisely inserting the soft and flexible electrode threads into the brain. Individual threads are then connected to a custom chip that filters and compresses the recorded neural data, before sending it out through a low energy Bluetooth connection to a smartphone. A single chip can connect to around fifty to a hundred threads, each with multiple independent contacts, for a total of a thousand individual recording (and stimulation) sites. One of the major changes in the newly unveiled “second generation” device is that the entire system fits inside a capsule about the diameter of a quarter dollar coin, albeit five times thicker (2.3cm in diameter and 0.8cm thick). This package is meant to replace the piece of skull removed during surgery. In other words, a coin-sized hole is drilled into the skull, the electrodes are inserted into the brain using a robotic sewing machine, and then the hole in the bone is plugged with the device rather than the removed piece of skull. This allows for an elegant implant with limited wiring and no transcutaneous connectors. Of note, the surgical robot has also been significantly streamlined and improved, presumably moving it closer to something that could be used in an operating room and on humans. However, details were scarce, making it hard to evaluate any of these changes accurately. The short version is that the technology was very much in line with what had been shown last year, only improved, as can be expected of a company iterating towards a commercial product.
</p><p>
<b>A presentation light on details</b><br>
After their presentation last year, Neuralink received considerable backlash from the scientific community for excessive hype and failing to recognise similar existing technologies. While hype was still available in spades this year, there was in my view an effort to somewhat scale down ambitions. For example, Neuralink’s mission was stated in much more concrete terms this year: "The purpose of Neuralink is to solve important brain and spine problems." While there had certainly been talk of neurological disorders last year too, they had been overshadowed by very aspirational and futuristic mission statements within the first 5 minutes of the talk, including the distant idea of healthy people using brain interfaces to "achieve a symbiosis with artificial intelligence”. These ideas still made it onto the stage this year, but only later in the event during the speculative part of the Q&amp;A session. Similarly, engineering efforts have been refocused and concretised. Last year’s plan of implanting 4000 channels in their first human participant appears to have been scaled down to a single 1024 channel device. This brings them much closer to the roughly 250 channels currently implanted in human participants enrolled in research studies, including at the University of Pittsburgh where I currently work.
</p><p>
While some neuroscientists are allergic to the hype and the grandiose statements Elon Musk is known for, it’s important to remember that Neuralink isn’t a research lab—it's a Silicon Valley startup. Their event had over a hundred thousand live streamers (despite being the middle of the night in Europe), and the video has since amassed over 2 million views. That’s a big reach—this was no scientific conference talk. A startup’s CEO needs to straddle the line between realistic short term goals and an overarching mesmerising vision to recruit talent and raise money. It’s the same duality that leads to sharing images of towns on Mars (perhaps even with a human-made atmosphere) all while building the world’s most advanced rockets. In Neuralink’s case, there is the added ethical danger of presenting treatments that clearly won't exist for decades, raising false hopes in people afflicted by neurological disorders. However, by offering no explicit timelines or plans, Neuralink is making no promises, only engaging in long term speculation. The same way we can trust people not to sell their homes in preparation for a move to Mars, we should trust them not to take dramatic health decisions based on 20 minutes of sci-fi thought experiments and speculation.
</p><p>
Neuralink’s scientific and engineering merits ought to be judged on the systems it produces, not its storytelling. That is what I will try to do here. Since there is  simply not enough information to make a thorough evaluation—educated guesses will have to do.
</p><p>
<b>Neuralink’s strength is not science, it’s engineering</b><br>
Despite the aforementioned lack of details, a few laudable achievements were on display at Friday's event. The biggest was a demonstration that Neuralink's new device (Neuralink’s Neuralink?) works in vivo (in pigs), and did so for two months. The ability to wirelessly stream from 1024 cortical channels in a freely behaving animal is a big step in the right direction and a demonstration of what money and a talented team can deliver. The same is true of another extremely well-funded neurotechnology startup: Kernel, as <a href="https://edoardodanna.ch/article/thoughts_on_kernel_announcement"> I discussed after their last announcement</a>. In both cases, the real breakthrough is the ability to take existing prototypes from research labs and integrate them into a well designed and engineered product. The robot and implantable system Neuralink showcased are more polished than anything currently available, even if none of the individual ideas or components is completely novel. At the end of the day, execution is what matters. The history of technology is littered with examples of companies successfully combining existing ideas and prototypes into compelling  products and popularising them (e.g. Apple’s first successful point and click user interface, which borrowed from Xerox's PARC in-house prototypes).
</p><p>
<b>The biggest challenges still lie ahead</b><br>
While the engineering progress is impressive, where Neuralink still needs to do some convincing is on the science. What we have seen so far is excellent execution of things we knew could be done (miniaturisation, wireless system, surgical robot, etc). The next steps for Neuralink will increasingly involve tackling unsolved scientific challenges, which are an entirely different flavour of problem. Science is much harder to rush, it's less amenable to a startup’s timeline. For instance, Neuralink currently uses thin-film based electrodes, which have yet to demonstrate long term viability in academic labs (where they are extensively studied and have been for some time). Thin films have interesting properties such as very small sizes, high mechanical flexibility, and well-established fabrication processes, which make them well suited for brain implants. But their long term stability remains a looming challenge. So far Neuralink has demonstrated their electrodes can work for 2 months in pigs. That’s a long shot from showing they can work for five or ten years in humans. As Matt Angle, the CEO of another high profile neurotech startup called Paradromics, recently put it: “if you want to test whether something can last 10 years, you really have to wait 10 years.”
</p><p>
The other big challenge is what to do with a thousand channels once they are implanted and stable. Many of the applications mentioned in the presentation are plausible and actively researched (e.g. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006899314015674">stimulation of visual cortex to restore sight</a>, <a href="https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/8/361/361ra141?__hstc=12316075.07430159d50a3c91e72c280a7921bf0d.1525132800142.1525132800143.1525132800144.1&amp;__hssc=12316075.1.1525132800145&amp;__hsfp=1773666937">stimulation of the somatosensory cortex to restore touch</a>, etc). But each of these is an active area of research full of unanswered questions. Having a thousand channels instead of a few hundred will not significantly change the game. For instance, we know that electrically stimulating any of these sensory areas can elicit corresponding percepts (e.g. localised flashes of light when stimulating the visual cortex). But these sensations are often crude replicas of their natural counterparts, with limited spatial resolution, unnatural qualities and limited dynamic range. While one can extrapolate from these results and imagine a future where improved artificial sensations become practical and useful, it will take a lot more than increasing the number of available channels by one or even two orders of magnitude. 
</p><p>
Talking only about stimulation is perhaps a little unfair, since it's the less advanced side of the neural interface coin. Recording information from the brain is much better understood, especially for motor areas, as illustrated by <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2560/12/1/016011/meta">this study</a> from the University of Pittsburgh where a brain implant is used to control a robot with 10 degrees of freedom. Neuralink's first demonstration will likely be to help a paralysed person control a computer with their mind, or perhaps even a robotic device of some kind (this second one is less likely because of the added complexity). Concretely, a system like this could allow the user to interact with a computer by controlling a cursor (i.e. point and click) and input text (either by using a virtual keyboard, or perhaps a more cutting-edge approach like the one I discussed in <a href="https://edoardodanna.ch/article/brain_calligraphy">a recent post</a>). On top of that, the user could control a few additional virtual “buttons”. In other words, the first Neuralink product could be a virtual brain-steered controller, with a joystick, three or four buttons and a speech …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Even in Go, concurrency is still not easy (with an example)</h2>

	<p><small>September  1, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Go is famous for making concurrency easy, through good language
support for <a href="https://golangbot.com/goroutines/">goroutines</a>. Except
what Go makes easy is only one level of concurrency, the nuts and
bolts level of making your code do things concurrently and communicating
back and forth through channels. Making it do the right things
concurrently is still up to you, and unfortunately Go doesn't
currently provide a lot of standard library support for correctly
implemented standard concurrency patterns.</p>

<p>For example, one common need is for a limited amount of concurrency;
you want to do several things at once, but only so many of them.
At the moment this is up to you to implement on top of goroutines,
channels, and things like the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/sync/"><code>sync</code></a>
package. This is not as easy as it looks, and quite competent people
can make mistakes here. As it happens, I have an example ready to
hand today.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/google/gops">Gops</a> is a convenient command to
list (and diagnose) Go processes that are currently running on your
system. Among other things, it'll tell you which version of Go they
were compiled with, which is handy if you want to see if you have out
of date binaries that should be rebuilt and redeployed. One of the
things <code>gops</code> needs to do is look at all of the Go processes on your
system, which it does concurrently. However, it doesn't want to look
at too many processes at once, because <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/pull/118">that can cause problems with
file descriptor limits</a>. This
is a classic case of <em>limited concurrency</em>.</p>

<p>Gops implements this at the moment with code in <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/blob/6fb0d860e5fa50629405d9e77e255cd32795967e/goprocess/gp.go#L29">goprocess.FindAll()</a>
that looks like this, in somewhat sketched and reduced form:</p>

<blockquote><pre>func FindAll() []P {
   pss, err := ps.Processes()
   [...]
   found := make(chan P)
   limitCh := make(chan struct{}, concurrencyProcesses)

   for _, pr := range pss {
      limitCh &lt;- struct{}{}
      pr := pr
      go func() {
         defer func() { &lt;-limitCh }()
         [... get a P with some error checking ...]
         found &lt;- P
      }()
   }
   [...]

   var results []P
   for p := range found {
      results = append(results, p)
   }
   return results
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>(In the real code there's a WaitGroup for coordination, and the
<code>found</code> channel gets closed appropriately.)</p>

<p>How this works is clear, and is a standard pattern (covered in eg
Go 101's <a href="https://go101.org/article/channel-use-cases.html">Channel Use Cases</a>). We use a
buffered channel to provide a limited number of tokens; sending a
value into the channel implicitly takes a token (and blocks if the
token supply is exhausted), while receiving a value from it puts a
token back in. We take a token before we start a new goroutine, and
the goroutine releases the token when it's done.</p>

<p>Except that <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/issues/123">this code has a bug if there are too many processes
to examine</a>. Even knowing
that there is a bug in this code, it may not be obvious.</p>

<p>The bug is that the goroutines only receive from <code>limitCh</code> to release
their token after sending their result to the unbuffered <code>found</code>
channel, while the main code only starts receiving from <code>found</code>
after running through the entire loop, and <strong>the main code takes
the token in the loop and blocks if no tokens are available</strong>. So
if you have too many processes to go through, you start N goroutines,
they all block trying to write to <code>found</code> and don't receive from
<code>limitCh</code>, and the main <code>for</code> loop blocks trying to send to <code>limitCh</code>
and never reaches the point where it starts receiving from <code>found</code>.</p>

<p>At one level, this bug is a very fragile bug; it only exists because
of multiple circumstances. If the goroutines took the token by
sending to <code>limitCh</code> instead of the main <code>for</code> loop doing it, the
bug would not exist; the main <code>for</code> loop would start them all, many
would stop, and then it would go on to receive from <code>found</code> so that
they could receive from <code>limitCh</code> and release their token so other
goroutines would run. If the goroutines received from <code>limitCh</code> to
release their token before sending to <code>found</code>, it wouldn't exist
(but because of error handling, it's simpler and more reliable to
do the receive in a <code>defer</code>). And if the entire <code>for</code> loop was in
an additional goroutine, the main code would go on to receive from
<code>found</code> and unblock completed goroutines to release their tokens,
so the fact that the <code>for</code> loop was blocked waiting to send to
<code>limitCh</code> wouldn't matter.</p>

<p>At another level, this shows how concurrency is not easy as easy
as it looks in Go. All you need is one mistake and things skid to
a halt, and all of the code involved can look good to a casual
examination. Getting concurrency correct is simply hard for people
(we can debate about why, but I think that it is is very clear).</p>

<p>(I'm sure that the people who wrote and approved the change that
added this concurrency limiting code to gops were good programmers.
A tricky case still tripped them up, passing all of their scrutiny.
Even when I knew that there was a concurrency problem in the code
and where it was (because my <code>gops</code> was hanging all of a sudden,
and <a href="https://github.com/go-delve/delve">Delve</a> told me where
everything was stuck), it still took me some time to see what the
exact problem was.)</p>

<p>Dynamic, functional programming languages like Clojure are sometimes considered “slower” than their statically-typed and/or OO counterparts, due to facilities like dynamic function dispatch and immutable-orientation, etc. But this comparison is too general. </p>



<p>Clojure is <em>readily</em> optimizable in cases where utmost performance is key. Clojure embraces the “Get it working, then make it fast” approach to building up a software system—even large-scale systems with high performance demands<a href="#footnotes" data-type="internal" data-id="#footnotes">¹</a>.</p>



<p>This post is about micro-optimizing Clojure code: how can we improve our Clojure code performance on the JVM when we need it the most, when hot code paths and tight loops prevail—for example, in large-scale data processing systems.</p>



<p>General JVM performance, benchmarking, and tuning is a broad and deep skillset and there are many more considerations beyond Clojure. The focus here is Clojure-specific.</p>

<p>Before we get to our specific list of Clojure optimizations, we should emphasize that running your own benchmark and profiling experiments is essential to producing specific top-level performance outcomes for your own code and domain.</p>



<p>You could follow all of the advice in this post, shower your code with type hints, remove laziness and sequences, etc, etc, and⁠ without a <em>specific</em> performance model for where your costs are coming from and how to measure improvement, it is possible or even likely to see no dip in your processing latencies or reduction in your cloud bill<a href="#footnotes">²</a>.</p>



<p>We recommend the following tools for performing your own analyses; these were all used in developing this post:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/hugoduncan/criterium">criterium</a> A benchmarking tool that is a Clojure industry-standard at this point; most of the relative benchmarks in this post are generated from the REPL using criterium.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/clojure-goes-fast/clj-async-profiler">clj-async-profiler</a> For minimal quick and dirty Clojure profiling. REPL-enabled.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/gtrak/no.disassemble">no.disassemble</a> For inspecting Clojure-compiled byte code from the REPL. (If you’re familiar with <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javap.html">javap</a>, the output is what you would see from decompiling classes using javap -c on the command-line, except you can see what a compiled Clojure function looks like.)</li><li><a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/">jmh</a> (Java Microbenchmark Harness) A feature-rich benchmarking toolkit for the JVM. Its usage is heavily Java/annotation-based (so not REPL-friendly) but it has an expressive feature set, making it possible to run more specialized<a href="http://hg.openjdk.java.net/code-tools/jmh/file/4a420afe8a9e/jmh-samples/src/main/java/org/openjdk/jmh/samples/JMHSample_30_Interrupts.java"> </a>benchmarks such as <a href="http://hg.openjdk.java.net/code-tools/jmh/file/4a420afe8a9e/jmh-samples/src/main/java/org/openjdk/jmh/samples/JMHSample_30_Interrupts.java">ones</a> that could deadlock (and many others; see <a href="http://hg.openjdk.java.net/code-tools/jmh/file/tip/jmh-samples/src/main/java/org/openjdk/jmh/samples/">here</a>.) We find it essential in carrying out a comprehensive benchmarking analyses and we’ll demonstrate out how to use it with Clojure a bit later on.</li></ul>



<h2 id="avoiding-laziness">Avoiding Laziness</h2>



<p>Clojure’s sequence abstraction and laziness are powerful programming facilities but we must shy away from these tools when memory and compute are in high demand. </p>



<p>Why? Lazy implementations require generating&nbsp;<em>per-element&nbsp;</em>state and this can be substantial overhead when compared to non-lazy alternatives like arrays and vectors whose elements each contribute just their own value’s size to memory.</p>



<p>Accordingly there is computation overhead in laziness due to this per element construction; compare lazy implementations of map and filter to transform values in a vector with a non-lazy (<a href="https://clojure.org/reference/transducers">transducer</a>-based) alternative:</p>

<p>into has first-class transducer support; the same over-<em>2x</em> gains follow when using transducers + transduce in favor of laziness + reduce.</p>



<p>Avoid laziness where scale matters.</p>



<h2 id="first-and-last">first and last</h2>



<p>This one is particularly frustrating. We might expect <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/first">first</a> and <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/last">last</a> to have special consideration of their provided type. But this is not the case; they are implemented over Clojure’s lazy sequence API without respect of type. Even with a vector, last will obtain the result using a full linear pass over the data. Both first and last <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/seq">seq</a> the input unnecessarily which is additional computation cost.</p>



<p>Of course we have a way out⁠—but the moral of the story is to stay well away from first and last when optimal performance is required. Here’s a full sequence of benchmarks; notice the dramatic relative cost of first and last on vectors. Pick the latencies you like the best:</p>

<p>Edit: Clojure’s <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/peek">peek</a> will answer the last item of a vector optimally.

<h2 id="equiv-equals">equiv and equals</h2>



<p>An occasional need in high-performing applications is a read-heavy, in-memory cache or value registry, commonly with some kind of composite/tuple for its map keys. It turns out that the choice of datatype (for both map and key) are… erm… key here.</p>



<p>Consider the following benchmarks for a simple map lookup using different combinations of map type (Clojure’s PersistentHashMap vs. Java’s HashMap) and composite key type.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>PersistentHashMap</td><td>[“a” “b”]</td><td>167 ns</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>(ArrayList. [“a” “b”])</td><td>95 ns</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>“a:b”</td><td>78 ns</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>(→CacheKey “a” “b”)</td><td>116 ns</td></tr><tr><td>HashMap</td><td>[“a” “b”]</td><td>36 ns</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>(ArrayList. [“a” “b”])</td><td>53 ns</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>“a:b”</td><td>33 ns</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>(→CacheKey “a” “b”)</td><td>152 ns</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Benchmarks for (get map key) for different map and key types. CacheKey is a basic defrecord type; “a:b” is a simple String with the composite values concatenated, etc.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is quite a lot of variation in performance: JDK’s HashMap performs significantly better (except when using a record key—we’ll look at that one later). What accounts for this? </p>



<p>Clojure defines <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/equality">equality</a> (i.e., clojure.core/=) more generically than Java’s .equals and this definition is used by Clojure’s data structures for equality comparison, PersistentHashMap in this case:</p>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br></p></td><td><p><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span>v <span>[</span><span>"a"</span> <span>"b"</span><span>]</span> v2 <span>[</span><span>"a"</span> <span>"b"</span><span>]</span><span>]</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>report<span>-</span>result<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>quick<span>-</span>benchmark<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span><span>=</span> v v2<span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <br>
<span>;; Execution time mean : 91.347726 ns</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>report<span>-</span>result<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>quick<span>-</span>benchmark<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span><span>.</span>equals v v2<span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <br>
<span>;; Execution time mean : 10.741904 ns</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>




<p>Significant performance difference for these composite (vector) keys.</p>



<p>Of course, Clojure’s = is more general than Java .equals, which is a stricter comparison in several cases; here is just one example:</p>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br></p></td><td><p><span>(</span><span>.</span>equals <span>[</span><span>1</span> <span>2</span><span>]</span> <span>[</span><span>(</span>int <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>2</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><br>
⇒ false<br>
<span>(</span><span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span> <span>2</span><span>]</span> <span>[</span><span>(</span>int <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>2</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><br>
⇒ true</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>




<p>So we need to be sure that the keys we use in our map are carefully constructed to always compare correctly with the stronger .equals semantics.</p>



<p>Lastly, using a defrecord (CacheKey) appears to offer the worst performance. Let’s use some lightweight profiling to understand what is going on here, by comparing records vs vectors as keys:</p>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br></p></td><td><p><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span>k <span>(</span>→CacheKey <span>"a"</span> <span>"b"</span><span>)</span><br>

Map lookup using a vector tuple as the key.</figcaption></figure>



<p>From our profiling, the map equality used by the CacheKey record looks suspicious. We can confirm its performance is much worse than vector equals:</p>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br></p></td><td><p><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span>ka <span>(</span>→CacheKey <span>"a"</span> <span>"b"</span><span>)</span> kb <span>(</span>→CacheKey <span>"a"</span> <span>"b"</span><span>)</span><span>]</span><br>

<span>;; Execution time mean : 11.376671 ns</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>




<p>The performance overhead we’ve discussed here is minimal for map lookups of singular values like keywords; we are generally okay to stick to Clojure datatypes for data entities where these key types are idiomatic. Still, using records (defrecord) for data entities can have a significant twofactor impact on key lookups:</p>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br></p></td><td><p><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span>k <span>(</span>→CacheKey <span>"a"</span> <span>"b"</span><span>)</span><span>]</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>quick<span>-</span>benchmark<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>:<span>a</span> k<span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><br>
<span>;; Execution time mean : &nbsp;5.638519 ns</span><br>
&nbsp; <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span>k <span>{</span>:<span>a</span> <span>"a"</span> :<span>b</span> <span>"b"</span><span>}</span><span>]</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>quick<span>-</span>benchmark<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>:<span>a</span> k<span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><br>
<span>;; Execution time mean : 10.495481 ns</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>




<p>To make a broader generalization to wrap up this section, the JDK ecosystem at large has battled-hardened collection and data structure offerings for high performance use cases and Clojure’s Java interop (with type hints!) gives us access to any of these that make sense for our code hot spots.</p>



<h2 id="dynamic-vars">Dynamic Vars vs. ThreadLocal</h2>



<p>Another occasional need is for a per-thread state mechanism. Clojure has dynamic vars and binding, but the Clojure implementation of reading a dynamic var is far less optimal than using a ThreadLocal directly:</p>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br></p></td><td><div><p><span>(</span><span>def</span> <span>^</span>:<span>dynamic</span> <span>*</span>dyna<span>-</span>state<span>*</span> nil<span>)</span><br>

        <p>When developing a website, the web security part of the site is often forgotten or not the most crucial consideration. But in today’s society where everyone is on the internet surfing and sharing their personal information everywhere. Web security should be considered the number one priority.</p>
<p>To make a more secure web a list of the most common web vulnerbiliteis exsists. The Open Web Application Security Project helps you discover vulnerabilities and preventing them.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-open-web-application-security-project">What is The Open Web Application Security Project</h2>
<p>In September 2001, Mark Curphey started a non-profit organisation called The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), OWASP was a spin-off of the “webappsec” mailing list (Huseby, 2004). OWASP goal was to document and share knowledge and tools on web application security to help developers secure their web application against common security flaws. OWASP’s core values are to be open, innovative, global and have Integrity in the community (OWASP, n.d. B). All of the content from OWASP is freely and easily accessible from the OWASP website(OWASP, n.d. B).</p>
<p>OWASP provides many types of tools for testing the security of web applications, for example, OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP). ZAP is an open-source project that can help to find security vulnerabilities automatically. OWASP also provides lists of the top security vulnerabilities that exist on the web, the most known List from OWASP is the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks. They also provide a Top 10 API vulnerabilities list.</p>
<p>OWASP top 10 Web Application Security Risks is a list of the top 10 security concerns that is a common threat to web applications in the last few years (Cloudflare, n.d. A). This report is updated by a team of security expert from all over the world every few years (Cloudflare, n.d. A). OWASP claims on their site that implementing the OWASP top 10 is the most effective step toward changing the development culture in an organisation to produce more secure code (OWASP, n.d. A).</p>
<p><strong>This OWASP list is from the top 10 from 2017</strong></p>

<p>Stuttard (2011) claims in his book “The web application hacker’s handbook” that every web site he have tested between 2007 and 2011 was vulnerable to some of these. As high as 94% was susceptible to XSS, 78% had Sensitive Data Exposure, 62% had broken authentication, and 32% was vulnerable to SQL injection.</p>
<h3 id="1-injectionhttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a1-injectionhtml">1. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection.html">Injection</a></h3>
<p>Injection vulnerability is the number one biggest problem on the web; injection is when untrusted data is sent via a form or other data submission, and then this data goes to a code interpreter. The most know injection form is SQL injection, SQL injection happens when someone sends specially crafted data to a format that expects a plaintext string to send through a SQL quarry to evaluate to return the desired data (OWASP, n.d. A).</p>
<p>To prevent Injection attacks, all input on a site must be validating the input and rejecting suspicious data and then sanitisation of the data by cleaning it for symbols that could potentially lead to injections (Cloudflare, n.d. A).</p>
<h3 id="2-broken-authenticationhttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a2-broken_authentication">2. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A2-Broken_Authentication">Broken Authentication</a></h3>
<p>Login and authentication system that is implemented incorrectly could potentially have critical vulnerabilities that make it possible to gain access to someone else’s account and potentially compromise the whole system via an admin account (OWASP, n.d. A). Some example of broken authentication could be credential stuffing attack which means automatic injecting username/password pairs from earlier web site breaches (OWASP, n.d. C). The username/password pair list is then automatically entered into the site to check if one hacked account from another site is the same on other websites.</p>
<p>To reduce the attack factor for authentication vulnerabilities, a 2-factor authenticator should be implemented as it limits the ways that an attacker could access the system (Cloudflare, n.d. A). The authentication system should also be limited to how many times someone can try to login with the use of rate-limiting.</p>
<h3 id="3-sensitive-data-exposurehttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a3-sensitive_data_exposure">3. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A3-Sensitive_Data_Exposure">Sensitive Data Exposure</a></h3>
<p>A web application that exposes sensitive information either via not adequately protected API’s and websites. The data can be stolen either by just being exposed without proper authentication or via a man in the middle attack (MITM). MITM is when someone is listening in on the traffic that is exchanged via a client and a server (Cloudflare, n.d. B).</p>
<p>To minimise the data exposure, all data that contains sensitive information must be encrypted both when the data is in rest and when in transit, and the web application should only store essential sensitive data.</p>
<h3 id="4-xml-external-entities-xeehttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a4-xml_external_entities_xxe">4. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A4-XML_External_Entities_(XXE)">XML External Entities (XEE)</a></h3>
<p>Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a human and machine-readable markup language. The XML is processed by an XML parser if the parser is poorly configured, the input can reference external entities like a file URI and then sending the data to an attacker.</p>
<p>Due to the complexity and many security vulnerabilities that exist in XML parsers, XML should be phased out with a more straightforward data format or patch the XML parser and turn off the external entities.</p>
<h3 id="5-broken-access-controlhttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a5-broken_access_control">5. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A5-Broken_Access_Control">Broken Access Control</a></h3>
<p>An access control system should enforce what a user is allowed to do on a system, when this is not adequately enforced, or the system is broken, users can have access to data and functions that they should not be able to access (OWASP, n.d. A).</p>
<p>Broken Access Control can be secured by using Authorisation tokens on the web application (Cloudflare, n.d. A). Authorisation tokens is a token that is sent with each request to check that the request comes from the right person. The token should be checked for each request for what it is allowed to do.</p>
<h3 id="6-security-misconfigurationhttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a6-security_misconfiguration">6. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A6-Security_Misconfiguration">Security Misconfiguration</a></h3>
<p>Misconfiguration is when a system is not configured correctly, incomplete or by using default configuration that leads to displaying verbose error messages, that can contain sensitive data either about users or about the system which could lead to revealing vulnerabilities in the application (OWASP, n.d. A).</p>
<p>Misconfiguration can be mitigated by removing unused code from the code base and make the configuration less complicated and also check that the production code is not giving out debug messages and making error messages more general (Cloudflare, n.d. A).</p>
<h3 id="7-cross-site-scripting-xsshttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a7-cross-site_scripting_xss">7. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A7-Cross-Site_Scripting_(XSS)">Cross-site Scripting (XSS)</a></h3>
<p>Cross-site scripting (XSS) occurs when untrusted data is displayed on a webpage without the data being properly validated and sanitised (OWASP, n.d. A). XSS can occur when an input filed without proper validation and sanitising is saved and then return to the site again, like a comment on a forum. XSS can create HTML object on the site and even run untrusted JavaScript code in the client browser, which can lead to session hijacking, defacing the site or redirect the user to a malicious site which looks like the original site.</p>
<p>Like Injection, XSS vulnerabilities can be mitigated by validating and sanitise every input fields that users can write content (Cloudflare, n.d. A). Every HTTP request also needs to escape all data that is sent via URLs. Modern web development frameworks often provide build-in cross-site scripting protection (Cloudflare, n.d. A).</p>
<h3 id="8-insecure-deserialisationhttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a8-insecure_deserialization">8. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A8-Insecure_Deserialization">Insecure Deserialisation</a></h3>
<p>Serialisation is a concept of taking one object and turning it into a format that is more fitting to other tasks, like storing it on disk or in a database or for sending the data over a network (OWASP, n.d. A). Deserialisation is when a serialised object is converted back to its original form that can be easier for software to work with (OWASP, n.d. A). When deserialisation is not done correctly, it can lead to remote code execution, replay attacks, injection attacks and even privilege escalation attacks.</p>
<p>Deserialisation vulnerabilities are not easy to mitigate. However, there are some ways of preventing it from happening, like implementing strong type checking and monitoring the deserialisation process (Cloudflare, n.d. A). However, the only way to be sure that it is not exploited is to not deserialisation untrusted data streams.</p>
<h3 id="9-using-components-with-known-vulnerabilitieshttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a9-using_components_with_known_vulnerabilities">9. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A9-Using_Components_with_Known_Vulnerabilities">Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities</a></h3>
<p>Modern Web applications today are not coded 100% at the company, external components and libraries are often used to make the process faster to build as it helps the developer reduce to code needed to be written (Cloudflare, n.d. A). Some example libraries are the widely used front-end framework like Angular.js and Vue.js or backend frameworks like express.js. Thousands of websites are built on top of these frameworks, and often have multiple different types of libraries. If a vulnerability is found in a library that is popular potentially, several hundred thousand webpages are vulnerable to exploit (OWASP, n.d. A).</p>
<p>Update all library often with the latest security fixes and stay up-to-date on what libraries that have vulnerabilities in them (Cloudflare, n.d. A). Go over the web application often and reconsider every single library used and remove libraries that are not used or not actively maintained.</p>
<h3 id="10-insufficient-logging-and-monitoringhttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a10-insufficient_logging252526monitoring">10. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A10-Insufficient_Logging%252526Monitoring">Insufficient Logging and Monitoring</a></h3>
<p>A data breach on average take up to 200 days from the attack happened to it get discovered (Cloudflare, n.d. A), which gives an attacker a lot of time to find the data they want and take over other systems on the network. When it is discovered the logs can be erased or not be complete enough even to investigate what happened.</p>
<p>Logs need to be stored multiple places, and on remote servers, the logging service needs to be an append-only database mode so no one can overwrite the logs that exist (Cloudflare, n.d. A),. There should be integrity control on every record that is written, so no log files can be tampered with. Every action taken on the site needs to be logged, access …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

<!-- Horizontal Top Article -->
<p>GPT-3 has become famous overnight through viral posts on social networks. Between hype and anxiety, what exactly is GPT-3? <strong>Why this AI surprised so many devs in particular?</strong> Is this game changer?</p>



<h3>For science</h3>



<p>Today, we will discuss artificial intelligence. And I know that this subject tends to piss off a lot of people very quickly. Especially developers. Y<strong>et, for now, AI is just a tool like any other.</strong></p>



<p>I’m not going to explain what AI is or how a model works. We will only talk about what unleashes passions, <strong>generator of hype or anxiety attack depending on the point of view</strong>, GPT-3!</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kLrSCZK.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/kLrSCZK.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>The company behind this technology is <a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenAI</a>. OpenAI is famous for three main reasons.</p>



<p><strong>The first is that one of the founders is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elon Musk</a>.</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/27/elon-musk-artificial-intelligence-ai-biggest-existential-threat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The person who is the most afraid of artificial intelligence in the world</a>. The other founder is <a href="https://twitter.com/sama" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sam Altman</a> who we will talk about later.</p>



<p><strong>The second is the reason why this company exists.</strong> The goal of OpenAI is to develop artificial intelligence in a safe and sustainable way for human beings. Musk is convinced that uncontrolled AI will cause the end of humanity, so OpenIA promote a safe way to control it.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="OpenAI - Non-profit AI company by Elon Musk and Sam Altman" width="940" height="529" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AbcRlDBnwjM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p><strong>The third is that OpenAI is frequently in the news with these impressive repeated successes in its field.</strong> Notably the former <a href="https://openai.com/blog/language-unsupervised/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GPT</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GPT2</a> models. The last one being our hot topic of the day.</p>



<h3>What’s GPT-3</h3>



<p><strong>Generative Pretrained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">language model</a> that uses deep learning (neural network) to produce text. </strong>For the uninitiated, I’m embarking on a highly simplified explanation that will make specialists cry blood.</p>



<p>The principle of a language model is to look at one part of a sentence and predict the next word. <strong>GPT-3 is a technology that has been trained on a SCANDALOUS amount of text written by humans</strong>. Nearly a <strong><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/05/29/openai-debuts-gigantic-gpt-3-language-model-with-175-billion-parameters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TRILLION</a></strong> words via <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/the-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">common crawl</a>. Based on this small sample, it generates text (output) that makes the most sense for an input.</p>



<p>Concretely,<strong> by learning to predict which letters and words tend to follow each other when written by a human</strong>, GPT-3 is able to predict text that makes sense in a context. It’s the same concept as your cell phone predicting the next word when you write a message. Except that it’s infinitely bigger, more complicated and more advanced.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xwi5mbF.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/xwi5mbF.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>And so far, GPT-3 is not bringing much new. The architecture of this technology (<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/https-medium-com-chaturangarajapakshe-text-classification-with-transformer-models-d370944b50ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transformer-based</a>) is the same as the previous version (GPT-2). <strong>This architecture is almost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3 years old</a>.</strong> So what is so special about GPT-3?</p>



<h3>Huge</h3>



<p>GPT-3 is absolutely gigantic! GPT-2 was already huge with no less than 1.5 billion parameters. The previous record was held by <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/turing-nlg-a-17-billion-parameter-language-model-by-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Turing-NLG of microsoft</a> with these 17 billion parameters. <strong>GPT-3 explodes all records with an indecent 175 billion parameters!</strong> Never seen before.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>And the aftermath of this is impressive results. GPT-3 is capable of far too much.</p>



<ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3#william-shakespeare" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">write poems</a></strong> in the style of certain authors</li><li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/OthersideAI/status/1285776335638614017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">write your emails</a></strong> with your own style</li><li><strong><a href="https://maraoz.com/2020/07/18/openai-gpt3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">write blog posts about himself</a></strong></li><li>write <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/16/21371049/gpt3-hacker-news-ai-blog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>number one blog posts on hacker news</strong></a></li><li>write<strong> <a href="https://jamesyu.org/singular/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whole fictions</a></strong>, <a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many fictions</a></li><li>even <a href="https://play.aidungeon.io/main/landing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>infinite interactive fiction games</strong></a></li><li>design <a href="https://twitter.com/jsngr/status/1284511080715362304" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>simple applications</strong></a></li><li>the list is endless and it’s getting longer every day… if you want to scare yourself, here’s <a href="https://gpt3examples.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>a website that groups them together</strong></a>.<br></li></ul>



<div><p>And GPT-3 is capable of something else that immediately worried developers. <strong>GPT-3 is capable of producing code.</strong> Do you want a todo list application in ReactJS instantly? Just ask for it.</p></div>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I built a todo list app simply by describing it to GPT-3.</p><p>It generated the React code for a fully functioning app within seconds.</p><p>I'm becoming more impressed and aware of its capabilities every single day. <a href="https://t.co/QGrClar03s">pic.twitter.com/QGrClar03s</a></p></div>— Sharif Shameem (@sharifshameem) <a href="https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1284421499915403264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 18, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dat-tran-a1602320_wow-sharif-shameem-created-a-gpt-3-code-generator-activity-6689448377245147136-H_0c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">She can produce code</a> but also <a href="https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1285789362647478272" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">read and interpret it</a>. <strong>She can do this in <a href="https://twitter.com/josephbrionesaz/status/1283097878223675392?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">any language</a>.</strong> Some SQL to do ? <a href="https://twitter.com/FaraazNishtar/status/1285934622891667457" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">No problem</a>.

Even 3D in Javascript <a href="https://twitter.com/Antonio_GomezM/status/1287969287110443008" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can be done</a>. In short,  some easy developer tasks can now be automated by GPT-3.</p>



<p>Of course, with all this exploding at the same time on the Internet, many have asked themselves the question of <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/will-gpt-3-kill-coding-630e4518c04d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the future of developers</a>. <strong>For some <a href="https://kitze.io/posts/gpt3-is-the-beginning-of-the-end" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s the beginning of the end</a>.</strong></p>



<p>As I write this, <strong><a href="https://onezero.medium.com/gpt-3-is-an-amazing-research-tool-openai-isnt-sharing-the-code-d048ba39bbfd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenAI refuses to give away the source code despite its goal of transparency</a></strong>. The official reason? This technology is too big and greedy for people to run it themselves. They put it behind <a href="https://beta.openai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a paywall</a> that allows OpenAI to monetize its research.</p>



<p>Two months after the first appearance of GPT-3, most people agree on one thing. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/robtoews/2020/07/19/gpt-3-is-amazingand-overhyped/#36405ce81b1c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>GPT-3 is as superb as overrated.</strong></a> And this is especially true for developers.</p>



<h3>Overhyped</h3>



<p>GPT-3 is super impressive. It’s a great tool to do a lot of things. <strong>But the important thing to understand is that <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/22/1007539/gpt3-openai-language-generator-artificial-intelligence-ai-opinion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GPT-3 doesn’t understand anything it produces</a></strong>. It makes a mathematical prediction that certain letters should appear in a certain order.</p>



<p><strong>A developer’s job is infinitely more complicated.</strong> Developing a complete application that meets a human need requires a lot of thought. No algorithm has the ability to think about problems the way humans do. No thinking, no reasoning ability, no nothing…</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZVSbJQuPouw/maxresdefault.jpg" data-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZVSbJQuPouw/maxresdefault.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>Going further in the reflection we realize that <strong>GPT-3 is simply a new tool for developers</strong>. It is almost a new language where the interface would be directly explanations of what needs to be done instead of code.</p>



<p>And it’s quite relevant to compare the instructions given in GPT-3 to code. <strong>GPT-3 doesn’t understand vague requirements.</strong> GPT-3 needs very precise, surgical instructions, or it will produce crap. Where a human being will translate, correct and arrange vague requirements, GPT-3 will just produce crap. Or produce nothing at all.</p>



<p>GPT-3 is the largest look-up table ever created. Superintelligence is another story. It’s anything but today, and Sam Altam, the second founder of OpenAI, says so himself.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The GPT-3 hype is way too much. It’s impressive (thanks for the nice compliments!) but it still has serious weaknesses and sometimes makes very silly mistakes. AI is going to change the world, but GPT-3 is just a very early glimpse. We have a lot still to figure out.</p>— Sam Altman (@sama) <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1284922296348454913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 19, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>And all this, not to mention the many limitations and nonsense that GPT-3 produces every day. So right now, developer are safe. </p>



<h3>What about tomorrow?</h3>



<p>Last year, I posted this article on <a href="https://www.jesuisundev.com/quel-avenir-pour-les-developpeureuses-informatiques/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the future of developers</a> (french version). I’m talking about no-code, low-code, quantum computing and many other nice things. <strong>I made the crazy prediction that in 30 years (that’s a lot) the machine will start to nibble away at some parts of our work.</strong> No replacement, just a nibbling of certain tasks, or even certain parts.</p>



<p>I had been crucified. Insults by email and on Twitter, unsubscribing and disappointment. I left the comments section as is (as always), it’s a beauty.</p>



<p>A year later, GPT-3 makes its appearance and proves that some very simple developer tasks can already be delegated to the machine.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/i7j0QCj.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/i7j0QCj.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>GPT-3 can’t do anything against the job of developer. <strong>But this technology raises <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/openais-gpt-3-the-end-of-cargo-cult-programmers-23102f70f855" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the skill bar for becoming a developer very slightly</a>.</strong> To do what the machine can’t do on its own.</p>



<p>And if this bar is already rising today, where will it be in 30 years? I’m the first to find the speeches that demonize current IAs ridiculous. But the speeches that talk about an AI as stupid as its feet for eternity seem very naive to me. <strong>Where will be the skill bar needed to beat the machine in 30 years?</strong></p>



<p>I am also well aware that the way we make artificial intelligence today is <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/openais-gigantic-gpt-3-hints-at-the-limits-of-language-models-for-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reaching a ceiling</a>. <strong>It would take a new and innovative way of doing artificial intelligence to make sense of my concerns.</strong> How can we be sure that these new ways of doing things will not emerge in the future?</p>



<h3>Epilogue</h3>



<p>For now, the future of programming is programming. Artificial intelligence continues its path, but as long as it doesn’t understand what it does, it’s going to be fine. You just have to put up with the fact that it is capable of more and more destabilizing things. How can you be sure that the article you just read is not written by an artificial intelligence?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>From time to time newly graduated hackers ask me: <em>“Do you have any advice for beginning my career?”</em></p><p>I’ve found myself repeating 3 principles over and over again. On reflection, I realized these principles apply more broadly. I <em>think</em> they might answer the question <em>“Do you have any advice on for beginning my life as an adult?”</em></p><p>I thought I’d share these ideas with you here. The style and the examples I wrote are career-oriented, but I think the core ideas will still help in your decision making. I hope you enjoy them : ).</p><p><em>What should you do?</em> is one of the hardest questions to answer when you start out.</p><p>The default path is to follow what’s popular or prestigious. That can lead to a bunch of problems: What’s prestigious is already highly competitive. When you compete with smart people in a game that has established rules, just keeping up will take most of your time. That leaves little time to explore what interests you. When you don’t explore what interests you, you won’t understand things as deeply, and that leaves you with an undifferentiated skillset.</p><p><strong>The solution here is to follow your taste.</strong> Popularity and prestige are lagging indicators. Your taste, especially as a young, curious person, is a signal for <em>what will be</em> popular in the future. Regardless though, when you follow you taste, you’ll find yourself much more interested in the problems you’re solving. When you’re interested in the problems you’re solving, you’ll discover deeper truths, build deeper expertise, a differentiated skillset, and have more fun along the way.</p><p>Now, you may be wondering: <strong>What if you don’t even know what you’re interested in?</strong></p><p>Don’t worry. You just need to tune into and strengthen your taste. To do that, just do <em>anything</em>. Once you do <em>anything</em>, ask yourself, what part of that thing do you  find interesting?</p><p>Start going deeper there, and all of a sudden, you’ll discover a wealth of interests.</p><p>Next up, you may be wondering: <strong>What if your interests keep changing?</strong></p><p>Don’t worry. It’s totally fine. Just follow it. You’ll be surprised how things will serve you down the road. As long as you’re working hard and you’re learning, it’s a good use of time.</p><p>You may also wonder: <strong>What if your interests <em>are</em> what’s popular and prestigious today?</strong></p><p>That’s great. Follow that, but instead of competing, start sensing what actually interests you in that field and go deeper.</p><p>The ideas may seem career oriented, so you may be wondering: <strong>What if I just want to travel and explore the world?</strong></p><p>That’s great too! It’s your taste, telling you that you want to travel. Follow it and see where it leads you.</p><p>As you discover your interests, you may find that they’re not necessarily popular. Yet, when you go deeper and do your thing, something magical will happen…which leads us into the second principle:</p><p>As you explore and follow your taste, you’ll discover a subset of people who share your core interests and values.</p><p>Nurture those relationships. Some of these people will be your friends for life. Many of those people will become very successful in the future.</p><p>The people you know will show you what’s possible and work alongside you in deepening, exploring, and innovating on your shared interests.</p><p>You may be wondering: <em>what if you live in the middle of nowhere, and there aren’t people who get you?</em> Do your best to go to the center of wherever your community is. That may be SF for hackers or Los Angeles for entertainers or Paris for artists, the list goes on. You know where it is for you.</p><p>Now, this may sound impractical to you, but you’ll be surprised with what you can do. You can start off online in the meantime.</p><p>One common pitfall here is <em>focusing only on successful people in your field.</em> This misses the point. Sure, reach out to those successful people, but remember that the young, curious, interested people right next you, <em>will become those successful people in the future.</em> You have tons of time to spend together, so it’s great way to deepen your relationships. I’m not saying that you shouldn’t reach out to successful people (you definitely should), but to remove “success” as a criteria altogether for choosing who you spend your time with.</p><p>Now, you may be wondering, <em>how do you deepen those relationships?</em> That leads to us to the third principle:</p><p>As you form your community, new ideas and ways to collaborate will spring up. Take those opportunities: work together, support each-other and play. Over time, which you have a lot of right now, you will form a tight tribe of friends.</p><p>As a happy side effect, you’ll become exposed to new fields, new technologies, interesting problems, and interesting opportunities. Start taking them, and you’re well on your way to a career that’s <em>made for you.</em></p><p>One common issue here is a lack of self belief. This may lead you into choosing what you think “you are capable of”, rather than what you’re interested in. One way to get around this is to just experiment: let yourself dream and work with your friends, even if the problems seem fantastically hard.</p><p>There are a lot of examples I can give you if you’re interested in what I’m interesting in: From <a href="https://m.stopa.io/my-favorite-books-11e6b5a3ac0a" target="_blank">my favorite books</a> to <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html" target="_blank">Paul Graham’s essays</a> to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paradigms-Artificial-Intelligence-Programming-Studies/dp/1558601910" target="_blank">Norvig’s Paradgims of AI programming</a>, to <a href="https://m.stopa.io/favorite-rich-hickey-talks-6bcb23da6ff2" target="_blank">Rich Hickey talks</a>. But, instead I encourage you to think: <em>what interests you right now?</em></p><p>If you’re up for it, I’d love to know your answer: <strong><em>what interests you right now?</em></strong> Feel free to leave your answer in the comments or to email me directly, I’d be curious to hear : )</p><p>There’s a slew of people who have influenced and mentored me. These ideas are just as much them as me.</p><p>On the idea of taste specifically, the big shoutout has to go to Paul Graham. A lot of my thinking about this was inspired by reading his essays over and over when I started out. I highly suggest reading them.</p><p><em>Thanks to Daniel Woelfel, Talha Baig, Martin Raison, Irakli Safareli, David Magaltadze, Joe Averbukh, Julien Odent, for reviewing this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

Hey everyone,</p>

<p>It's long overdue for Twitter to add an edit button. It's really not that hard.</p>

<p>Help us put this billboard next to Twitter HQ so we can get the 2 days of
<br>engineering work that's required prioritized.</p>

<p>If we raise more than the $2,590 goal, we'll get a bigger billboard.</p>

<p>I heard they use Rails, so I went ahead and wrote the code for them:

<p>There, now just copy and paste!</p>

<p>With â�¤ï¸�,</p>

<p>The internet.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I like my two big hi-res monitors. I love my keyboard and my mouse. And I connect them to my stationary
“main” PC and to several other Windows and Mac laptops, alternatively. I’d like to easily switch where these peripheral
devices are connected to, and that’s the traditional role of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVM_switch">KVM switch</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately for me, KVM switches that support 4K/60hz resolutions cost hundreds of dollars, there are
no KVM switches that support USB-C, and I couldn’t find KVM switches that support multiple high-res monitors
either.</p><p>So I decided to implement a mixed hardware/software solution: my monitors (all monitors today really) have more
than one input, so I can connect all my computers simultaneously. The idea is:</p><ul><li>Switch USB devices in hardware.</li><li>Detect this switch in software, and switch monitors inputs as needed.</li></ul><p>To switch USB devices, I ordered <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01N6GD9JO">this USB 3.0 two-computer switch</a> from Amazon,
that’s $38 Canadian, under $30 USD.</p><p>To automatically switch monitor inputs, I <a href="https://github.com/haimgel/display-switch">wrote some software</a>.</p><p>My plan was:</p><ul><li>Watch for USB device connections/disconnections.</li><li>When a configured device is connected, use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_Data_Channel#DDC/CI">DDC/CI</a> to
send a command to all connected monitors to switch inputs.</li><li>In case the power management turned the video output off, turn it on again (otherwise the monitors will auto-switch
back to the input that actually supplies video output).</li></ul><p>I needed this to happen on Windows and on a Mac, and mature cross-platform support for USB low-level
control and hot plug, DDC/CI and monitor power management is non-existent. I ended up implementing this two
times: <a href="https://github.com/haimgel/display-switch/tree/master/MacOS">once in Swift</a>, for MacOS, and the
<a href="https://github.com/haimgel/display-switch/tree/master/Windows">second time in Rust</a>, for Windows.</p><p>Amazingly enough, this works really well: when I press the button on the USB switch, monitor input is changed
instantaneously, it feels like a “real” KVM switch! 🎉</p></div></div>]]>

<p>We create a 5-rule parser to efficiently and accurately parse affirmative present tense sentences in Japanese.  With just 5 rules you can understand Japanese grammar deeply.</p>



<h2>Deconstructing Japanese</h2>



<p>Linguistics is often unnecessarily complicated.  “Why state concisely with one term when there are 300 different varieties for these intimates and particulars?!”  Simplicity speaks volumes and good teachers teach simple concepts that help unify greater features easily.</p>



<p>To that end, let’s see if we can produce Japanese with an EBNF grammar.</p>



<p>For this we will be using <a href="https://github.com/Engelberg/instaparse">an excellent functional library for clojure called Instaparse</a>.  </p>



<p><a href="http://instaparse-live.matt.is/#/-LxnE95QbDy2LZ_m5XAZ/v1">You can see a <em>live</em> <em>demo</em> of Instaparse online with this grammar here.</a></p>



<p>Update: 2020-1-8: A fully recursive parser can be found here <a href="http://instaparse-live.matt.is/#/-Ly5y7xvJoDkHhIs0UKD/v1">http://instaparse-live.matt.is/#/-Ly5y7xvJoDkHhIs0UKD/v1</a></p>



<h2>What’s an EBNF grammar?</h2>



<p>It’s like a regular expression for sentences.  “Extended Backus-Naur Form.” If you’re familiar, skip ahead.  If not…<br><a href="https://condor.depaul.edu/ichu/csc447/notes/wk3/BNF.pdf">Here’s a useful slideshow.</a>  The wikipedia article is not for the uninitiated, but <a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/grammars-bnf-ebnf/">this article</a> is a bit clearer if you are new to this way of representing grammars.       EBNF is from the realm of “Context-Free Grammars” and is mainly used in computing.  Given that it is definitely about grammar and syntax, EBNF proves very useful in language analysis and generation.  You make rules for breaking down sequences of characters (sentences) into labeled output chunks (parse tree).</p>



<h2>Is it possible to parse Japanese with EBNF?</h2>



<p>Can we make any real headway using <em>computer syntax</em> to decipher human language?  English seems impossible for native language speakers to parse at times.  Is it really possible to parse Japanese with EBNF and label parts of speech accurately?</p>



<h3>はい！ Yes!</h3>



<p>Yes!  However, for <strong>real</strong> Japanese from the wild there would need to be many many rules, and any slight deviations from the rules would not result in a full parse.  So, rather than try and build our own google translate today, why don’t we just try to cover the maximum amount of Japanese with the minimum amount of rules.</p>

<h2>Rules for an EBNF Japanese Grammar</h2>



<p>Japanese has nouns, verbs, particles, and sentence-final-fitters.  That’s it. *  <strong>With 5 concepts we can cover the whole Japanese grammar.</strong>  Amazing.  Japanese is regular enough that its composition can be described in a handful of rules.</p>



<ol><li>A sentence is made of zero or more Bunsetsu-Jars and a Sentence-Final-Fitter. <br><strong>S = JAR* SFF</strong></li><li>A Bunsetsu-Jar is made of zero or more Modifiers, and must have a noun and a particle. <br><strong>JAR = M* noun-no P |  JAR* noun-no no</strong> <p><em>[UPDATE 2020-1-8: fully recursive with extension of rule 2]</em></p></li><li>Particles can be any of the Japanese grammar particles that describe the role of their preceding word in a sentence: が、を、と、で、に、etc。 <br><strong>P = が | を | と | で | に …</strong></li><li>Sentence-Final-Fitters have only 4 options and can be either nouns with the Copula だ (da), or simply verbs with u, or verbs with i.<br><strong>SFF = noun-no だ。 | noun-na だ。 | verb-u。 | verb-i。<br></strong>(sentence-final period included in this rule)</li><li>Modifiers can be nouns  with their relevant letter (“no” or “na”), or simply verb-u or verb-i.<br><strong>M = noun-no の | noun-na な | verb-u | verb-i</strong></li></ol>



<p>With just 5 main rules we can parse all of Japanese.  That’s exciting!  Granted, this is not negation or past tense, just present affirmative, but with small extensions those advancements are accommodatable. </p>

<p>Notice Japanese has no spaces, all parsing relies on accurate detection of symbol in sequence.  ImagineifEnglishhadnospaceswoulditbehardtoread?</p>



<h2><strong>Recursion Update 2020-1-8</strong></h2>



<p>By extending Rule 2 (JAR = … ) to include JAR*, we achieve full recursion on Japanese terms using の [no]</p>

<h2>Death to Adjectives</h2>



<p>Japanese has nouns that take な [na] and nouns that take の [no] when they are used as modifiers.  </p>



<p>Japanese also has verbs that end with an う [u = oo as in “food”] sound and verbs that end with an い [i = ee as in “week”] sound.</p>



<p>Bringing “adjectives” into the mix just gets things really dirty and offers no benefit to the learner.  Stick with 2 kinds of verb and 2 kinds of noun and Japanese will be easy to master.</p>

<h2>Parsing Improves Comprehension</h2>



<p>Important in language learning are the exercises that parse written language correctly.  Learning how the written language is parsed can help one’s mental model, and this will lend to stronger audible comprehension thanks to a deeper understanding of the underlying structure.</p>

<p>*When we say “that’s it,” we are putting words like おいしい into the verb-i column, and words like げんきな into the noun-na column.  Simplifying into two categories, nouns and verbs, actually proves immensely useful and practical in Japanese.  It’s a simplification that should be in all the textbooks and literature.  Congrats 2020.</p>

    <p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/enterprise_say_no/sorry-dave.jpg" alt="Sorry Dave">
Nobody likes being told “No”</p>

<p>To sell your product to enterprise buyers, minimize the times when you need to say “No” during the sales cycle.</p>

<p>Enterprise software purchasing is a complex process with potentially innumerable stakeholders and procedural hurdles to cross. Even if you have a badass product that will perfectly fit your customer’s needs, you still need to wade through a complex buying process.</p>

<p>The decision to buy a product like Netflix is simple: I want to watch a once-in-a-generation classic like “<a href="https://bestlifeonline.com/selling-sunset/">Selling Sunset</a>,” so I pay for Netflix to stream it into my greedy eyeballs. As an individual, I make the purchasing decision and enjoy the rewards alone (thankfully).</p>

<p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/enterprise_say_no/sunset.jpeg" alt="Selling Sunset">
I actually think that most of the characters on this show would be absolutely lethal at selling enterprise software</p>

<p>Contrast this to a buyer like the US Air Force deciding to use Slack – even just calculating the number of users that they’ll have is a non-trivial task, and that’s for a relatively straightforward, consumer-friendly SaaS product. Transformational changes – say, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/26/jedi-10-billion-department-of-defense-bidding/">moving to the cloud</a> – can be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/08/microsoft-and-aws-exchange-poisoned-pen-blog-posts-in-latest-pentagon-jedi-contract-spat/">exponentially more complex</a>. The number of stakeholder approvals and compliance hurdles that must be vanquished on the way to this sort of purchase boggles the mind, but this is exactly where you make your bones as an enterprise SaaS business.</p>

<h2 id="detractors-want-you-to-say-no">Detractors Want You to Say “No”</h2>

<p>Innumerable potential blockers can arise during a sales cycle: you’ll have to say “No” to a particular use-case provided by the product that you’ll be replacing, or explain why you lack a feature that a buyer was expecting from a previous job. In most cases these gaps are unimportant… but these blockers can really throw a wrench into the sales process.</p>

<p>Adversaries who oppose a new software vendor will latch onto any time when you don’t say “Yes” like a lamprey – poking holes in the case to buy your product. Blocking stakeholders are typically incentivized to either preserve the status quo or explicitly harm your case, and include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Teams who are incentivized to minimize risk, such as Compliance, Legal, IT, and (in some cases) Security.</li>
  <li>Teams who are frequently blamed if a poor buying decision is made, such as Procurement. Some companies also just have risk-averse, blame-heavy cultures in general.</li>
  <li>Champions of incumbent solutions – for example, an executive who originally purchased the product that you’re replacing.</li>
  <li>People who don’t want to do the work of changing to a new vendor.</li>
  <li>Competitors.</li>
  <li>(Rarely, but occasionally) people who are just nihilistic or obstructionist jerks.</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the biggest enemies when selling to a complex organization is <strong>time</strong>. Buyers get discouraged if it’s taking too long to sign a new vendor, and there’s often a small window when a company is ready for change and the stars have aligned for them to drop some serious coin for it. Detractors will latch onto any “Nos” that they hear and use it to delay or kill a sales cycle. This is especially common when replacing a strong incumbent – you had better believe that Oracle knows every trick in the book to make it seem that your product is untrustworthy or incomplete.</p>

<p>In order to overcome this, allow your sales team to say “Yes” as often as possible. The client is worried about some niche use-case? We have a partner who will make it happen. The client wants a particular security feature? We can make sure that the particular risk the Security team flagged will be handled. The client needs to format their data <em>just right</em> for board meetings? With a little bit of elbow grease on the customer’s part, we can support it.</p>

<p>Ways to say Yes more:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Make your product as flexible as possible - eg make everything programmable via API or expose webhook callbacks for all major business actions. This helps customers, consultants, or your implementation teams extend your product’s capabilities for use-cases that are unique to them, which you’ll never directly build yourself.</li>
  <li>Identify major gaps that will be a pain to build for, and find quality partners who can fill in these capabilities. Similar to the above, this allows you to cover niche functionality that only a few customers will need.</li>
  <li>Make it easy to transfer raw data into or out of your platform. For example, virtually every enterprise product requires some amount of internal executive level reporting, which is typically both critical and highly team-specific. By furnishing raw data exports you can check the box of helping to provide these reports. Being able to ingest or output large volumes of data also helps check the box of whether it’ll be easy to migrate to your product.</li>
  <li>Building common no-regrets enterprise features. For example, the areas of governance (SAML, RBAC), security (password controls, 2FA, internal endpoint protection), compliance (SOC 2, HIPAA), and audit logs are all areas where it’s easy to have a gap that will scare the shit out of a conservative buyer. By building for lots of use-cases in this area, you can ensure that you won’t get ruled out for missing features that are peripheral to your core value proposition.</li>
  <li>Find the right customers. If you’re constantly finding yourself saying No during the sales cycle, you’re probably selling to the wrong folks. This is common for early-stage startups or when your sales &amp; marketing teams aren’t generating enough pipeline (forcing you to sell to weak leads). Having a very strong perspective on why your product is special, and who it’s special for, can help you to avoid this trap. So can having discipline – you’re often better off doubling down on making your core customer deliriously happy than stretching for a flashy new logo.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that the strongest form of #1 and #2 is turning yourself into a platform that others can build on top of.</p>

<h2 id="case-study-salesforce">Case Study: Salesforce</h2>

<p>Salesforce has a <em>decent</em> product. It’s by far the dominant player in the CRM industry, but it’s hardly a loveable product like (say) Zoom, Uber, Datadog, the iPhone, or even Excel. However, Salesforce has used this product to become the #1 in their industry, in part because their team can sell the hell out of it.</p>

<p>If you look at Salesforce, you’ll see that they use all of the techniques described above to ensure that they always have a story for how they can deliver, even if it requires extra integration work. Combined with their ferocious marketing, it’s little surprise that they’re approaching a $200B market cap as of this writing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They’re well instrumented with open APIs, and use ampscript to build custom functionality.</li>
  <li>They have an app marketplace built on these APIs that’s filled with niche solutions, creating a platform ecosystem, and will also acquire companies to fill product holes.</li>
  <li>They have a robust set of reporting and data import/export functionality, allowing complex organizations to onboard rapidly with services (if necessary).</li>
  <li>Salesforce has a metric ton of enterprise features, and also aggressively moves to support new platform expansions that enterprises might want, such as migrating to Microsoft Azure for their hosting.</li>
  <li>Salesforce’s target customer is well-defined and obvious – it’s literally in the name.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="case-study-slack">Case Study: Slack</h2>

<p>Slack got its start by selling to smaller organizations and startups, but has since extended their reach into the enterprise. As time has gone on and they’ve begun to see real competitors, they’ve used all of the this post’s enterprise sales tactics to continue to move up-market:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They have a web of Slash <code>/commands</code>, webhooks, and APIs that allow for easy integration.</li>
  <li>They used these tools to build a successful app marketplace, completing the platform strategy.</li>
  <li>They once made it dead simple <a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/360001851047-FAQs-about-migrating-from-Atlassian-to-Slack">to migrate from their once-largest competitor, Hipchat</a> (they’ve since killed Hipchat in their sleep like Washington crossing the Delaware). <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/migrate-slack-to-teams">They still provide this for Microsoft Teams</a>.</li>
  <li>Slack is now packed with enterprise-grade security and compliance features.</li>
  <li>As a horizontal SaaS product, Slack is a good fit for many organizations and relatively unlikely to find a particularly bad-fit customer.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>

<p>Saying Yes often (or saying No infrequently) is important in enterprise sales cycles. To find more ways to say Yes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Build a flexible product with programmable hooks.</li>
  <li>Fill niche functionality with partners, turning yourself into a platform.</li>
  <li>Make it easy to import and export data in bulk.</li>
  <li>Build no-regrets enterprise features.</li>
  <li>Sell to the right customers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>12) Ensure IP is Setup</h3>
<p>If not already done, select ‘Deny Outbound’ under ‘Action’. There are additional configurations available to include GeoIP and Reputation blocking. For GeoIP, select ‘Deny Outbound’ for any Continents you wish to block and modify these lists, as needed by selecting the pencil to edit.</p>

<h3>13) DNS Block List (DNSBL) Config</h3>
<p>DNSBL or a sinkhole/blackhole renders a site in it’s lists inaccessible. This gives you control over what users are able to access on your network.</p>
<h4>DNSBL SafeSearch</h4>
<p>If desired, enable SafeSearch network wide on Google, Yandex, DuckDuckGo, Bing, and PixaBay. You can also set Youtube restrictions and block Firefox DNS over HTTPS.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="382" src="https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_15.png" alt="pfBlockerNG Safe Search Config" srcset="https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_15.png 800w, https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_15-300x143.png 300w, https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_15-768x367.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><figcaption>DNSBL SafeSearch</figcaption></figure>
<h4>DNSBL &amp; IP Feeds</h4>
<p>We recommend you activate additional DNSBL not enabled by the pfBlockerNG Setup Wizard. To do that, you must select ‘Feeds’ and simply select the + next to the ones you would like to add. <strong>DO NOT</strong> select all feeds – we don’t add any IP feeds but instead limit our additions to DNSBL ‘Easylist’, all Ad Blockers, and some of the Malicious options. Don’t worry if some of the lists have duplicates, pfBlockerNG will make sure each entry exists only once. </p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="216" src="https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_16.png" alt="pfBlockerNG Feeds" srcset="https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_16.png 800w, https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_16-300x81.png 300w, https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_16-768x207.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><figcaption><em>DNSBL &amp; IP Feeds</em></figcaption></figure>
<h4>Feed Grouping and Setup</h4>
<p>pfBlockerNG groups DNSBL together on its own. You will need to access these groups to make sure they are enabled and properly configured. This page also allows you to remove a list whose URL is no longer active or that you no longer want to use. The main things to check are that the ‘State’ is ‘ON’ and the ‘Action’ is ‘Unbound’.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="539" src="https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_17.png" alt="pfBlockerNG DNSBL Config" srcset="https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_17.png 800w, https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_17-300x202.png 300w, https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_17-768x517.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><figcaption>Feed Grouping and Setup</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Adult Content Limitations</h2>
<p>The pfBlockerNG configuration above does a great job at everything we’ve discussed, but falls a bit short when it comes to blocking adult content. There is an option under DNSBL Category ‘Blacklists’ where you can enable Shallalist to block adult sites, but the list is large and not comprehensive. Other similar lists are also resource intensive so we ditched these lists and instead setup our pfSense firewall to use <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-1-1-1-1-for-families/" target="_blank">Cloudflare Family</a>&nbsp;as our DNS provider – a free service that blocks both adult content and malware. This paired with our pfSense firewall running pfBlockerNG gives us everything we need for a safe home network. </p>
<h2>Final Tweaks</h2>
<p>At this point you should have pfBlockerNG configured and running on your network. Now all devices on your network will enjoy blocked ads, improved security, and more privacy while online. Further pfBlockerNG tuning might be needed if you discover a page blocked or want additional blocks – just hop back into pfSense to make your tweaks. </p>
<p>Hope this helped you get pfSense pfBlockerNG setup on your home network. Let us know if we missed something or you have any questions.</p>

September 2, 2020 | https://kickstartcoding.online/learn/articles/i-converted-reactjs-org-to-use-hooks/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://kickstartcoding.online/learn/articles/i-converted-reactjs-org-to-use-hooks/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://kickstartcoding.online/learn/articles/hooks-or-not-hooks">When we decided to convert our React curriculum to React Hooks</a>, one of the biggest stumbling blocks we ran into was that almost all of the guides, tutorials, and blog posts about React Hooks are written with the assumption that the audience already knows React. Most resources are written from the perspective of ”How to switch from class-style React to hooks-style React”, not “How to learn hooks-style React from scratch”.</p>
<p>Our curriculum has a lot of supplementary reading links in it and it wasn't clear where we would be able to find supplementary reading that taught React Hooks with a beginner rather than a veteran audience in mind.</p>
<p>After some discussion, we came up with a possible solution. <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/">The ReactJS.org documentation</a> is an excellent resource for all things React, but the beginner guides and tutorial still use class-based React, and the hooks guides have the "aimed at React veterans" problem. This makes sense for these guides in context — a lot of people are still using class-style React, and most of the audience for hooks probably <em>is</em> React veterans — it just doesn't make as much sense for us as a coding school.</p>
<p>But the ReactJS.org site is also completely open source. So we thought: what if we just…updated it ourselves?</p>
<p>We decided to take a stab at doing just that and see how it went. This part of our curriculum update fell to me, so a couple of months ago I cloned the ReactJS.org repo and started experimenting to see how hard it would be to get up and running, adapted, and deployed.</p>
<h2>The Result</h2>
<p>It took a lot of work, and I’ll be talking about all the ins and outs of the update in a future post, because there were a lot of interesting challenges both pedagogically and technically. But for now the result is live at <a target="_blank" href="https://reactwithhooks.netlify.app/">reactwithhooks.netlify.app</a>, and you can take a look at the repo where the changes were made at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kickstartcoding/reactjs.org/tree/convert-all-to-hooks">github.com/kickstartcoding/reactjs.org</a> on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kickstartcoding/reactjs.org/tree/convert-all-to-hooks">the convert-all-to-hooks branch</a>.</p>
<p>The places you’ll find most of the converted examples and explanations are <a target="_blank" href="https://reactwithhooks.netlify.app/tutorial/tutorial.html">the tutorial</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://reactwithhooks.netlify.app/docs/hello-world.html">the main concepts sections</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://reactwithhooks.netlify.app/docs/accessibility.html">the advanced guides sections</a>. For those, we converted the concept explanations, the directions, and all of the examples (including the ones on CodePen so you can see and run working code snippets). Everything from the step-by-step directions for writing a tic-tac-toe game in React to explanations on how to integrate React with older library’s like Backbone.js is now written with hooks in mind.</p>
<p>We hope this will be a useful resource for anyone who either wants to learn React the hooks way from scratch, or who wants to see examples and/or explanations of some of the more complex React concepts implemented in the hooks style.</p>
<h2>Helping Out</h2>
<p>There were a few sections that were particularly tricky to figure out how to convert, or to figure out if conversion was even possible. If you’d like to help us out, take a look at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kickstartcoding/reactjs.org/tree/convert-all-to-hooks#unresolved-issues-with-modifying-the-docs-to-be-100-hooks">the ”unresolved issues” section of the README</a> and let us know if you know how to handle any of the things we couldn’t figure out.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://kickstartcoding.online/media-content/share/1599066782/407/"></p><p>There's still work left to do!</p>
</div><p>Also, of course, please let us know about any issues or bugs you fine to us the converted documentation. We definitely want to make sure it is as useful and error-free as possible.</p>
<h2>Fin.</h2>
<p>All in all, making this adaptation was one of the most fun projects I’ve been able to work on recently. We got a chance to use it as a resource for students during our last cohort, and it seemed to work pretty well. I’m hoping that it will be useful for other people trying to learn React as well, so check it out and let us know what you think!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><figure><p>If you’re here, you’ve likely been tasked with building SAML-based SSO as a requirement for an enterprise deal. If you’re just diving into the problem space of SSO / SAML, we’d first suggest checking out <a href="https://workos.com/blog/the-developers-guide-to-sso">The Developer’s Guide to SSO</a>. Otherwise, buckle up for a brief but titillating foray into why XML-based authentication is... challenging.</p><h2>Why is SAML SSO so vulnerability-prone</h2><p>The attack surface for SAML authentication is extensive, mostly due to the fact that SAML is XML-based. <a href="https://everypageispageone.com/2016/01/28/why-does-xml-suck/">XML is a semantic-free meta-language</a> - it’s hard to form, hard to read, and hard to parse. Combined with the high complexity of the <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/sstc-saml-tech-overview-2.0.pdf">SAML specification</a> and the number of parties involved in establishing authentication, we get what often feels like a <a href="http://www.laputan.org/mud/mud.html">big ball of mud</a> and all the accompanying implications. Be prepared to tackle a steep learning curve, lots of bugs, high maintenance costs, attack vectors galore, and an absurd spread of edge cases.</p><p>Most SAML SSO security vulnerabilities are introduced by Service Providers (SPs) improperly validating and processing SAML responses received from Identity Providers (IdPs). This happens because SAML SSO is typically not a core-value feature for an application, nor is the implementation common knowledge for most developers. Unknowns become even more unlikely to be identified and addressed when the pressure is on to just deliver <em>something </em>to unblock a high-value contract - as is oftentimes the case. However, to build SAML SSO safely and securely in-house requires significant buy-in and <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/07/11/single-sign-on-sso-stack-overflow-okta-integration/">investment by teams</a> - on the scale of months, representing hundreds of thousands of dollars in developer time.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>If not done right, you expose your application and your customers to potentially huge security risks. </strong>To drive that home, here are just a few recently published SAML-related vulnerabilities:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15585">January 27, 2020</a> - “... GitLab SAML integration had a validation issue that permitted an attacker to takeover another user's account.”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-4427">May 7, 2020</a> - “... an attacker could exploit this [SAML] vulnerability to bypass the authentication process and gain full administrative access to the system [IBM Data Risk Manager].”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-21263">June 19, 2020</a> - “An attacker could authenticate to a different user's [Mattermost] account via a crafted SAML response.”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-2021">June 29, 2020</a> - “... improper verification of signatures in PAN-OS SAML authentication enables an unauthenticated network-based attacker to access protected resources.”</li></ul><p>It should be evident by now that oversights in SAML implementations are ubiquitous and problematic, even among experienced engineering teams.</p><p>So let’s dive into some of the more common security pitfalls developers building SAML-based SSO should be aware of, as well as cover a few suggested countermeasures. Just to be clear, <strong>this guide is by no means comprehensive</strong> and is meant to provide a starting point for SAML security considerations as well as some follow-on resources.</p><h2>Brief anatomy of a SAML response</h2><p>Let's say we're integrating our application with Okta via SAML. Below is an example of an XML document we might get when attempting to authenticate a user, containing a simplified but valid SAML response:</p><p>Like we mentioned earlier, the SAML spec is complex and responses can get lengthy, so this example is comparatively quite terse. Keeping things to what you should know before we go into SAML vulnerabilities, let’s walk through what the response (<strong><em>&lt;saml2p:Response&gt;</em></strong>) is communicating:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Line 2 begins the SAML response, which has the unique ID <strong><em>id72697176167120131651975993</em></strong> and is intended for consumption by the <strong><em>workos-test</em></strong> service provider’s Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL, i.e. the endpoint <strong><em>https://api.workos-test.com/auth/okta/callback</em></strong>.</li><li>Line 3 specifies the issuer (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Issuer&gt;</em></strong>) and contains the unique URI (also referred to as EntityID) of the IdP that issued the response, in this case <strong><em>http://www.okta.com/exk1klancwHzz1SNi357.</em></strong></li><li>Line 7 begins the assertion (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Assertion&gt;</em></strong>) with the unique ID <strong><em>id7269717616793800631152500</em></strong>. An assertion is a package of information asserting the identity of a user, often containing additional user attributes like first / last name, email, ID, etc.</li><li>Line 8 specifies the issuer of the assertion itself, in this case also <strong><em>http://www.okta.com/exk1klancwHzz1SNi357</em></strong>.</li><li>Lines 9 - 30 contains the digital signature (<strong><em>&lt;ds:Signature&gt;</em></strong>) over the assertion, which should be validated to determine the authenticity of the assertion.</li><li>Lines 31 - 36 specify the subject (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Subject&gt;</em></strong>) of the assertion, i.e. the authenticated principal / user corresponding to the unique identifier found in <strong><em>&lt;saml2:NameID&gt;</em></strong>, who in this case is <strong><em><a href="https://workos.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="87e3e2eae8c7f0e8f5ece8f4aae8ecf3e6a9e4e8ea">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></em></strong>.</li><li>Line 37 (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Conditions&gt;</em></strong>) defines the window of time for which the assertion should considered valid, i.e. from <strong><em>NotBefore</em></strong> (inclusive) to <strong><em>NotOnOrAfter</em></strong> (exclusive).</li></ul><p>For the purposes of readability, the SAML 2.0 XML snippets in the remainder of this blog will be simplified, use shorthand, and be stripped of nodes that would otherwise be required in reality but are not relevant to what’s being illustrated. We’ll use a mythical IssueTracker, ContractManager, and PayrollService as hypothetical SPs that have implemented SAML authentication, which you should think of as placeholders for your application or other SAML SSO-enabled apps.</p><h2>Disable DTD processing</h2><p>The first step in processing a SAML response is parsing the payload. Parsing and loading an XML document into memory is an inherently expensive set of operations, but can be unexpectedly costly due to a feature of XML that allows references to external or remote documents, i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_type_definition">Document Type Definitions</a> (DTDs).</p><p>When a DTD is encountered, parsers will try to fetch and load the referenced document as well. If the referenced document is large enough or results in infinitely looping references, your server can be slowed or even brought down trying to complete the process. The same holds true if the payload itself is very large, DTDs or not.</p><p>Two low-hanging mitigations you should implement to prevent buffer overflows are:<br></p><ol role="list"><li>Limiting SAML payload size to &lt; 1MB. 1MB is a generous upper limit and should be tuned down based on average received payload size.</li><li>Configuring your XML parser to never fetch remote files or try to load and parse DTDs. Some XML parsers do so by default, for example, Python’s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html"><strong><em>xml.etree.ElementTree</em></strong></a> module.</li></ol><p>XML processing, and thus by extension SAML response processing, is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks from other scenarios described later on in this post. And unfortunately, protecting your application from a service outage is among the most mild of outcomes compared to the <a href="https://www.vsecurity.com//download/papers/XMLDTDEntityAttacks.pdf">possibilities exploiting XML DTD</a> allows - it is a dark and anxiety-inducing rabbit hole.</p><p>So, if you’re not writing your own XML parser (generally not suggested), it’s important to <strong>vet the XML parser(s) your application and its dependencies use</strong> - ensure they handle other exploits like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack">Billion Laughs</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb">Zip Bombs</a>.</p><h2>Validate the SAML response schema first<br></h2><p>The primary security mechanism in the SAML handshake is the cryptographic validation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Signature">XML Signatures</a> (XML-DSig) - which establishes the trust chain between IdPs and SPs. XML-DSig validation should always be done prior to executing business logic; however, the separation between signature verification and operating on the rest of a SAML payload opens up SAML authentication to vulnerabilities exposed by what are called XML Signature Wrapping (XSW) attacks. &nbsp;These attacks have numerous permutations which can result in outcomes such as (but not limited to):<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Denial-of-service by inserting arbitrary elements that lead to buffer overflows.</li><li>Escalating permissions by injecting assertions that allow an adversary to impersonate and be authenticated as another user, like an account admin.</li></ul><p>The exploit here consists of modifying the payload without invalidating any signatures - think <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection">SQL Injection</a> or <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/">Cross Site Scripting,</a> but for for XML.</p><p>Original response (pre-XSW):</p><p>Modified response (post-XSW):</p><p>The broadest countermeasure to XSW attacks is <strong>validating the schema</strong> of the SAML XML document. Payloads for SAML responses of any given IdP should have a deterministic standard schema that can be used as a reference in a schema compliance validation module, which should be executed prior to XML-DSig verification. Here are <a href="https://github.com/onelogin/python3-saml/tree/master/src/onelogin/saml2/schemas">example schemas</a> used by OneLogin’s <strong><em>python3-saml</em></strong> package to perform <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/python-saml/library/saml2.html#saml2.utils.OneLogin_Saml2_Utils.validate_xml">XML schema validation</a>. <strong>Schemas should be vetted local copies</strong> as opposed to being fetched from 3rd party remote locations at runtime or on server start.</p><p>All of that being said, <a href="https://www.nds.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/media/nds/veroeffentlichungen/2013/03/25/paper.pdf">schema validation isn’t foolproof</a>; there is room for error in the validation module logic itself, as well as in the syntactic rigor of the reference schema. A second low-hanging countermeasure to XSW attacks that should be employed for the sake of redundancy is to <strong>always use absolute XPath expressions</strong> to select elements in processes post-schema validation. Explicit absolute XPath expressions set an unambiguous expectation for the location of elements.</p><p>Here’s an example of a valid response that’s been modified in an XSW attack (specifically a signature exclusion attack, more on that later):</p><p>This modification also exploits the common, incorrect, but not unreasonable assumption that a well-formed SAML response will only ever have a single assertion. So while XML-DSig verification would succeed for the signature returned by <strong><em>doc.getElementsByTagName(“Signature”)[0]</em></strong>, the assertion returned and processed by <strong><em>doc.getElementsByTagName(“Assertion”)[0]</em></strong> would be the injected <strong><em>snek</em></strong> assertion. This attack would have been more likely to fail if the XPath expression&nbsp;<strong><em>“/Response/Assertion[0]/Signature”</em></strong> was used in the assertion signature validation logic.</p><h2>Check that you’re the intended recipient</h2><p>This sounds obvious, but make sure to check that a SAML response is intended for your app. This is low-hanging fruit that can prevent attacks exploiting IdPs that use a shared private signing key for all integrated SPs of a given tenant, as opposed to issuing unique keys per application. The most common attack entails the …</p></figure></div></div></div>

<p><em>Figure 1: The Jabber RCE vulnerability in action.</em></p>
<p>Security consultants from Watchcom discovered the four high severity vulnerabilities while pen-testing for a client. The vulnerabilities affect all currently supported versions of the Cisco Jabber client (12.1 – 12.9). The four vulnerabilities and their corresponding CVE numbers are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>CVE-2020-3495: Cisco Jabber Message Handling Arbitrary Code Execution (CVSS 9.9)</li>
<li>CVE-2020-3430: Cisco Jabber Protocol Handler Command Injection (CVSS 8.0)</li>
<li>CVE-2020-3498: Cisco Jabber Information Disclosure (CVSS 6.5)</li>
<li>CVE-2020-3537: Cisco Jabber Universal Naming Convention Link Handling (CVSS 5.7)</li>
</ul>
<p>This article describes the technical details of the vulnerabilities and gives useful advice for detection and mitigation.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Cisco Jabber is a video conferencing and instant messaging application. It is mainly used for internal communication, but can also be used to chat, call or conduct meetings with people outside of the organization. These days a lot of people are working from home and applications like Cisco Jabber are essential to stay connected, communicate efficiently and keep businesses running smoothly.</p>
<p>Given their newfound prevalence in organizations of all sizes, these applications are becoming an increasingly attractive target for attackers. A lot of sensitive information is shared through video calls or instant messages and the applications are used by the majority of employees, including those with privileged access to other IT-systems.</p>
<p>The security of these applications is therefore paramount, and it is important to ensure that both the applications themselves, and the infrastructure they are using, are regularly audited for security gaps.</p>
<p>During a recent penetration test for an unrelated client, security consultants Olav Sortland Thoresen and Torjus Bryne Retterstøl from Watchcom discovered four serious vulnerabilities in Cisco Jabber. The vulnerabilities range from medium to critical severity and two of the vulnerabilities can be used to gain remote code execution. The most severe vulnerability is also wormable, meaning that it can be used to automatically spread malware without any user interaction.</p>
<p>Watchcom immediately reported these vulnerabilities to Cisco and coordinated a responsible disclosure. Patches have been issued and all Cisco Jabber users are strongly encouraged to update to the latest version.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>All four vulnerabilities affect the Cisco Jabber client application and were tested on Windows. The Cisco Jabber client is based on the Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) and uses the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) for instant messages and presence updates. These two technologies are important for understanding the vulnerabilities and their implications. A brief overview of each of them is therefore provided below.</p>
<h3>Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF)</h3>
<p>CEF is a framework that allows developers to embed Chromium-based web browsers in their applications. It is used to create desktop applications based on web technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Normally, the code running in the embedded web browser is sandboxed and cannot access files or perform system calls. While this is a good security measure, application developers often want such functionality in their application and therefore find or create ways to bypass the sandbox.</p>
<p><em><strong>This leaves applications vulnerable in scenarios where the sandbox normally would’ve provided protection.</strong></em></p>
<p>Additionally, many applications that use CEF choose to pass through command line flags to the embedded web browser. This means that many CEF applications accept <a href="https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/run-chromium-with-flags" target="_blank">Chromium command line flags</a>. Some of these flags can be used to execute arbitrary commands or load arbitrary DLLs and should therefore be treated with caution.</p>
<h3>Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)</h3>
<p>XMPP is an XML-based protocol for instant messaging and presence. It is based on an open standard and is widely used in both open-source and proprietary software. XMPP is an extensible protocol and several extensions that provide additional functionality to the protocol exist.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://watchcom.no/siteassets/figure2.png" height="209" width="1137"> <em>Figure 2: An XMPP message containing both a plaintext and an HTML version of a message.</em></p>
<p>One of these extensions is XEP-0071: XHTML-IM. This extension defines how instant messages containing HTML formatted content can be exchanged over XMPP. Since HTML content can contain malicious elements, the specification states that applications must assume that messages containing HTML are malicious and sanitize them accordingly.</p>
<p>It also states that it must be possible for users to prevent automatic loading of images. Not all applications take such precautions and we will later see how this is the root cause of two of the vulnerabilities that we discovered.</p>
<h3>Cross Site Scripting Leading to RCE Vulnerability</h3>
<p>Cisco Jabber is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) through XHTML-IM messages. The application does not properly sanitize incoming HTML messages and instead passes them through a flawed XSS filter.</p>
<p>The filter is based on a blacklist of known-bad tags and attributes, but it is not comprehensive. Since the application is based on CEF, its embedded web browser will execute any scripts that can pass through the filter.</p>
<p>We discovered that the filter could be bypassed using the lesser-known onanimationstart attribute. Tags that had this attribute were not caught by the filter and were directly inserted into the embedded web browser’s DOM. This attribute is used to specify a JavaScript function that will be called when an element’s CSS animation starts playing. To achieve XSS using this attribute the element must have an animation assigned to it. It was not possible to inject custom CSS animations since &lt;style&gt; tags were caught by the filter, but we discovered a built-in animation called spinner-grow by grepping through the files in the installation directory. By combining these two, it was possible to create malicious HTML tags that bypassed the filter and were executed.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://watchcom.no/siteassets/figure3.png" height="387" width="1003"> <em>Figure 3: An XHTML-IM message that has been intercepted and modified. A malicious &lt;img&gt; tag has been added.</em></p>
<p>Cisco Jabber uses XHTML-IM by default for all messages. A malicious message can therefore easily be created by intercepting an XMPP message sent by the application and modifying it. Attackers can do this manually on their own machine or it can be automated to create a worm that spreads automatically.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://watchcom.no/siteassets/figure4.png" height="783" width="1123"> <em>Figure 4: When the victim receives the message, the JavaScript code is executed. In this case the code opens an alert box as a proof of concept.</em></p>
<p>After achieving XSS, we started looking for ways to escape the CEF sandbox. A vulnerable function (named window.CallCppFunction) was identified. This function is used to invoke native C++ code and the application uses it to, among other things, open files received from other Cisco Jabber users.</p>
<p>We discovered that this function can be abused by an attacker to run arbitrary executable files on the victim’s machine. The function takes a file:// URL as its second parameter and by manipulating this parameter an attacker can execute arbitrary .exe files.</p>
<p><em><strong>Since Cisco Jabber supports file transfers, an attacker can initiate a file transfer containing a malicious .exe file and force the victim to accept it using an XSS attack. </strong></em></p>
<p>The attacker can then trigger a call to window.CallCppFunction, causing the malicious file to be executed on the victim´s machine.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://watchcom.no/siteassets/figure5.png" height="464" width="794"> <em>Figure 5: An XHTML-IM message containing exploit code that escapes the CEF sandbox and launches calc.exe on the victim’s machine.</em></p>
<p>This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2020-3495 with a CVSS score of 9.9 (Critical) / CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H</p>
<h3>Protocol Handler Vulnerability</h3>
<p>While researching the XSS vulnerability, we discovered another high severity vulnerability concerning the handling of URLs with custom protocols.</p>
<p>Upon installation, Cisco Jabber registers protocol handlers for a number of different protocols. These are used to tell the operating system that whenever a user clicks on a URL containing one of the custom protocols (e.g. ciscoim:test@example.com) the URL should be passed to Cisco Jabber. In this case, the protocol handlers specify that the URL should be passed as a command line flag.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://watchcom.no/siteassets/figure6.png" height="255" width="1032"> <em>Figure 6: One of Cisco Jabber’s protocol handlers. The protocol handler specifies that URLs should be passed to the application as a command line flag.</em></p>
<p>These protocol handlers are vulnerable to command injection because they fail to consider URLs that contain spaces. By including a space in the URL, an attacker can inject arbitrary command line flags that will be passed to the application. Since the application uses CEF and accepts Chromium command line flags, several flags that can be used to execute arbitrary commands or load arbitrary DLLs exist. An example of such a flag is --GPU-launcher. This flag specifies a command that will be executed when CEFs GPU process is started.</p>
<p>This vulnerability can be combined with the XSS vulnerability to achieve code execution without transferring any files to the victim. This makes it possible to deliver malware without writing any files to disk, thus bypassing most antivirus software.</p>
<p>The video below shows the vulnerability being exploited. The attacker sends a malicious message, containing an XSS payload that escapes the CEF sandbox and uses the protocol handler vulnerability to execute commands on the …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>I went through Y Combinator’s W16 batch for my company StrongIntro — we helped tech companies grow their engineering teams through employee referrals. I was 17 at the time and the youngest founder in the batch of 300+ entrepreneurs. Here's what I learned:</p> <h2>The people you respect are closer than you think</h2> <p>I devoured all of PG's essays and read founder bios in my spare time growing up. Coming from a Boston suburb, I thought it would take ages to get to Silicon Valley and meet the founders I respected, let alone work alongside them. But I was able to get a job in SF with a single cold email and zero connections. A year later I was in YC listening to the founders of Reddit and Airbnb share their stories and getting advice from PG.</p> <p>This is not the case in the rest of the world, but Silicon Valley is incredibly welcoming to newcomers. If you're willing to work hard and create value it's entirely possible to work alongside the people you most respect within a short time period. I consider that magic.</p> <h2>No one knows the right answer</h2> <p>One of the first lessons YC taught us is that the partners, who were successful entrepreneurs and operators, would give us conflicting advice and that that's normal. This felt wrong to me. In school, the experts — teachers — always knew the right answer, and yet these partners who were the most successful people I'd met couldn't give me “correct” answers that would guarantee my startup’s success.</p> <p>This dampened my amazement at the time but it was also empowering. It showed me that my ideas could be just as valid as someone who's incredibly successful.</p> <h2>You don't need experience to get started</h2> <p>Outside of my own experience of getting into YC at a young age, there are numerous other examples of founders succeeding wildly with little to no experience. The Airbnb founders didn't have experience in hospitality, and they only came up with the idea after brainstorming startup ideas because they wanted to start a company (ironically VCs usually say this is not a good way to start a company). More recently, my batchmate Boom has been making waves building supersonic passenger airplanes. The founder was a software engineer at Groupon before starting the company.</p> <h2>Experience is only loosely correlated with age</h2> <p>The average age of the founders in my batch was 30. Going into the program I was intimidated that everyone else had so much more working experience than me, but I quickly learned that we were all winging it as most were first time founders like myself. YC's group office hours were a time for founders to share what they were struggling with, and everyone, regardless of age struggled with the same general problems such customers not liking their product enough, not growing fast enough, and cofounder difficulties.</p> <h2>Silicon Valley doesn't care about your background</h2> <p>In the East Coast experience and status are highly valued. Bill Gates created class scheduling software in high school, and I wanted to replicate that. I approached our school admin about doing the same when I was 16 and was promptly shut down because I was too young and "entire companies are required to create scheduling software." I wasn't even given the chance to fail.</p> <p>In contrast, no one cared about my age in YC. Most people didn't realize I was 17, and if they learned my age they always saw it as a positive trait instead of something that would hold me back. This stark difference in mindset makes sense when you consider how many young founders have famously succeeded in Silicon Valley (Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg) which is a trend that still persists to this day (Scale, Brex, Luminar).</p> <h2>Failure is acceptable</h2> <p>My company ultimately didn't succeed (we realized we needed to build a services business more than a technology business and that's not what we set out to do), and that was entirely okay. Most YC companies fail and it's baked into their business model — YC partners were even willing to fund my next business. This surprised me because school trained me to avoid failure at all costs — a single bad grade could tarnish my GPA permanently. The consensus goal was to get the right grades and internships to build a good resume, without any gaps that could tarnish the record.</p> <p>Silicon Valley's willingness to embrace failure is unintuitive but entirely logical. Startups aren't like school because there's no guaranteed playbook for starting a successful company — you need good execution but also experimentation and luck. Most applicants get rejected from YC multiple times before getting in, and most founders fail multiple times before succeeding. Travis Kalanick's first company failed. His second company had a modest exit after 6 years of grinding, and his third company was Uber. The Honey founders ran startups that didn’t go anywhere for years before they started Honey. Twitch was a struggling general-purpose streaming site before they doubled down on the gaming niche. The examples are endless. Failure is a necessary ingredient to success and Silicon Valley rightly internalizes that.</p> <div> <h3>Random musings</h3> <h4>East Coast vs West Coast</h4> <p>There's a more generalizable point in that the East Coast is typically more conservative than the West Coast. This is observable when dealing with venture capitalists from both sides as well. East Coast VCs are much more conservative, which is ultimately bad because it results in less moonshots succeeding. There are exceptions as well of course (ie Thrive Capital is ambitious and will bet on moonshots).</p> </div> </div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Monitoring Fleet Health with Heartbeat Metrics]]>

        <p>Releasing a connected device in today’s world without some form of monitoring in
place is a recipe for trouble. How would you know how often or if devices are
experiencing faults or crashing? How can the release lead be confident that no
connectivity, performance, or battery-life regressions have occurred between the
past and current firmware update?</p>

<p><strong>The answer is that you need device monitoring in place long before ever
shipping a firmware update to devices in the field.</strong></p>

<p>There have been several occasions in the past where I’ve introduced several
performance and battery-life regressions that were never caught in internal beta
testing of 50 devices. They were always subtle changes, such as an
“optimization” that ended up causing high file system churn (which reduced
battery life), or issues that crop up when connected over certain transports or
to different mobile phone models. These bugs were caught in one of two ways:
either a customer angry enough would submit a bug report, or we’d catch the
regression on our internal dashboards which were powered by our suite of SQL
queries that would run periodically.</p>

<!-- excerpt start -->

<p>In this post, we lay the foundation for how an organization should instrument
their embedded firmware to measure performance, stability, and the overall
“health” of each device and an entire fleet of devices. We also compare and
contrast the various approaches projects generally take to surface these metrics
and I’ll discuss why I believe heartbeat metrics are the best method for driving
product decisions.</p>

  <p>This post is guaranteed to be the tip of the iceberg in a series of posts
about how to do device monitoring <em>properly</em> at scale. With this in mind, this
post will be slightly more high-level than a typical “Interrupt” post.</p>

<h2 id="fleet-monitoring-overview">Fleet Monitoring Overview</h2>

<p>Device and software monitoring is not a new concept. There have been many new
ambitious projects to solve the problem from a couple of devices to monitoring
millions of servers or containers.</p>

<p>I’d like to talk about a few different variations of monitoring and how they
relate to us in the world of embedded systems.</p>

<h3 id="application-performance-monitoring-apm">Application Performance Monitoring (APM)</h3>

<p>Application performance monitoring services collect and aggregate different
metrics on computer systems and software, and they alert customers when these
numbers either increase or decrease in abnormal ways. Common metrics that are
collected by APM’s are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CPU, RAM, and hard drive usage</li>
  <li>Response times and values</li>
  <li>Request rates and failures</li>
</ul>

<p>They work by installing hooks in various places in the code. Common examples are
the pre/post request handlers for a web application and the pre/post handlers
for a database transaction. By hooking into both sides of common operations,
they can take a snapshot of the system before and after, and compare memory
usage and time deltas.</p>

<p>When an APM is hooked up to every instance of an application, it can paint a
detailed picture of how an application, server, or fleet of either are
performing at any given time.</p>

<p>APM’s aren’t a new concept, as one of the largest ones, New Relic, was founded
in 2008 and is now a publicly-traded company.</p>

<p><strong>Software services:</strong> New Relic<sup id="fnref:new_relic"><a href="#fn:new_relic">1</a></sup>, Datadog<sup id="fnref:datadog"><a href="#fn:datadog">2</a></sup>,
ScoutAPM<sup id="fnref:scout_apm"><a href="#fn:scout_apm">3</a></sup><br> <strong>Open Source Libraries</strong>: StatsD<sup id="fnref:statsd"><a href="#fn:statsd">4</a></sup>,
CollectD<sup id="fnref:collectd"><a href="#fn:collectd">5</a></sup>, Prometheus<sup id="fnref:prometheus"><a href="#fn:prometheus">6</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="tracing-and-logging">Tracing and Logging</h3>

<p>I’ve grouped these into a single group because they accomplish the same goal.</p>

<p>Traces and logs give you an in-depth timeline view of what happened on a single
device and allow you to zero-in on issues as long as you know what you are
looking for. They work by having the developer install logs or trace events
during the coding phase or automatically by installing hooks in the context
switch handler and various system API calls.</p>

<p>Traces and logs, just like an APM, can tell you where most of the time is spent
in an application or system, but there are drawbacks.</p>

<p>The amount of data collected by tracing and logging tools is immense, and most
of the data doesn’t get used or processed. In their raw form, they are not
easily aggregated or actionable.</p>

<p>I view tracing and logging as a silo of (valuable) data that is only queried
when developers <strong>know</strong> there is an issue with a specific device.</p>

<p><strong>Software services:</strong> New Relic<sup id="fnref:new_relic:1"><a href="#fn:new_relic">1</a></sup>, Datadog<sup id="fnref:datadog:1"><a href="#fn:datadog">2</a></sup><br> <strong>Firmware
services:</strong> Percepio<sup id="fnref:percepio"><a href="#fn:percepio">7</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="crash-reporting">Crash Reporting</h3>

<p>How nice would it be to have in-depth analysis and alerts for every unique
crash, fault, assert, and error log that devices in the field experience? That
is what these services provide.</p>

<p>When any of the listed error handlers are triggered, these libraries gather all
of the relevant data, such as previous logs, backtraces of the currently running
threads, local variables, global variables, etc. and push all of this data to a
central server to be processed. These issues are then de-duplicated and
presented in a bug-tracker like fashion to the user.</p>

<p>These systems usually require an SDK to be shipped with the application. These
services must build and support an SDK that is written in the same language and
for the same framework as the application they monitor.</p>

<p>For firmware, they would likely install hooks into the
<a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/asserts-in-embedded-systems">assert</a>,
<a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/cortex-m-fault-debug">fault</a>, and
<a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/firmware-logs-stack-trace">logging</a> handlers.</p>

<p>The beautiful thing about crash reporting tools is they are relatively easy to
integrate because the entry-points they hook into are standardized by the
language and frameworks. They also surface hard to reproduce or never before
seen issues easily and provide a wealth of data to fix the problem quickly.</p>

<h3 id="instantaneous-state-monitoring">Instantaneous State Monitoring</h3>

<p>This is the category that most of today’s “IoT monitoring solutions” fall into.
They assume a near-constant connection to the Internet and hold the state of
every device in the service.</p>

<p>Devices can either push this information whenever states change, at regular
intervals, or the remote server can pull data as well.</p>

<p>These systems ingest many of the system vitals that developers and managers want
to know, like heap usage, current battery life, or whether certain peripherals
are on or off. These values can be queried across the entire fleet or a subset
of devices, but trends or custom queries are more difficult.</p>

<p>For instance, attempting to query for the amount of time the Bluetooth radio is
on per day is nearly impossible, unless the infrastructure is <strong>100% certain</strong>
that it received every state change event from the device.</p>

<p>The statistic of time-active is a critical measurement for embedded devices, and
is one of the best predictors of battery-life drain and performance.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-embedded-systems">What About Embedded Systems?</h3>

<p>Most of the above services or strategies listed above do not apply to
constrained embedded systems. Save for Memfault and Percepio, most of the
solutions would require orders of magnitude more memory, CPU, power, and
Internet bandwidth.</p>

<p>There is hope though. We will explore how we can manage to get the most
important and actionable metrics out of embedded systems and gain an
understanding of how devices are performing in the field.</p>

<h2 id="logging-vs-metrics">Logging vs Metrics</h2>

<p>I want to quickly cover the difference and use-cases for two common forms of
data collected from systems: logs and metrics.</p>

<h3 id="logs">Logs</h3>

<p>Logs are immutable events that happened over time to a single device. They are
instrumental in debugging as they help a developer determine what happened
before and after issues occur.</p>

<p>Logs are usually forwarded from individual devices to a centralized datastore
such as S3, or to a log aggregator, such as Elastisearch, to be further
transformed and processed. Unfortunately, more often than not, the logs are
ingested and forgotten about.</p>

<p>A developer might dig up a particular device’s log files in response to a
customer support request, but that requires a <code>pull-logs-from-s3.py</code> script and
a decent amount of time to determine where the device behaved unexpectedly.</p>

<h3 id="metrics">Metrics</h3>

<p>Metrics are a set of numbers that give information about a particular process or
activity. They are measured over intervals of time and are usually just numbers.
This means that they are pre-processed and more compact than logs, which means
that you can store and query many more of them at once.</p>

<p>Metrics themselves don’t help developers debug individual instances of issues or
bugs, but they help organizations <strong>detect</strong> issues by measuring the data points
that matter most. For many hardware makers, these metrics might be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Crash-free hours</li>
  <li>Average battery life</li>
  <li>Wi-Fi/BLE connected time per hour</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="transforming-logs-into-metrics">Transforming Logs into Metrics</h3>

<p>Logs can be transformed, processed, and aggregated into metrics, but this
usually involves massive and complex data pipelines.</p>

<p>After working as a firmware engineer at a few hardware companies in the past, I
can tell you that I was out of my depth trying to parse logs at scale, and I was
rarely getting the help I needed from the web and infrastructure teams because
they had their own roadmaps to complete.</p>

<p>The other problem with logs is that they generally log state transitions and
force the developer or log aggregator to measure the time between these state
transitions. Let’s try to calculate one of the important device metrics above,
Wi-Fi connected time per hour.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[E][11:30:00] Wi-Fi connected
[W][11:45:00] Wi-Fi disconnected, reason: -2
[I][12:30:00] Wi-Fi connected
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This calculation is relatively easy assuming we can process logs linearly. We
see at 11:30 the device was connected to Wi-Fi, then disconnected at 11:45, so
the time connected this hour was 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Let’s present a problem that happens all the time with embedded systems.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[E][11:30:00] Wi-Fi connected

# Wi-Fi disconnect event lost by device or in transport

[I][12:30:00] Wi-Fi connected
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Oh no! A dropped log message.</p>

<p>Can we compute accurately how long the device was connected to Wi-Fi given the
information above? <strong>No we can’t</strong>. We’d probably throw away this event during
processing or accidentally include it and say Wi-Fi was connected for the entire
hour.</p>

<p>We can do …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Running a profitable agency is hard.</p><p>Using said profits to reinvest into real estate, stocks and tech startups is much harder. Jay Vasantharajah did exactly that. He is a very inspiring entrepreneur who has built an award-winning PPC agency and 7-figure eCommerce business. Something tells me this empire is just starting. I was curious to learn about his story and hear about what built his discipline to focus on cashflow and create an impressive investment portfolio.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>How did you get started in digital marketing?</strong></p><p>I started building websites for fun, and eventually convinced a small local accountant that I could build him a website. I think I made $500 for it, and quickly realized that I really enjoyed building websites. I went on to build&nbsp; websites for all the student councils in my university.</p><p>I then started learning PPC and SEO to help my dad drive business for his airport limo business. By the time I graduated university (I studied finance and accounting btw) I had a pretty good handle of digital marketing and web development.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>What is the origin story behind your agency, ClientFlo?</strong></p><p>I spotted the opportunity when I came across a large communication company selling a packaged PPC service to SMBs across Canada. The PPC packages being offered were terrible; they&nbsp; consisted of cookie cutter landing pages and copy/pasted campaign setups, and the results were terrible.</p><p>Yet this company was selling these PPC packages like hot cakes. I would spend hours reading and analyzing the negative consumer reviews. The demand for these services was there, and I knew based on my knowledge I could do better. And that’s when I decided to start ClientFlo out of my condo. I had no clients or connections, but the confidence that I could offer SMB’s better services.&nbsp;</p><p>I incorporated ClientFlo on a Friday, starting cold calling the following Monday and closed my first client within a week. That instantly gave me the confidence to keep going, close more clients and to grow my company. I would spend all day cold-calling potential clients, stay up all night managing the campaigns. Once ClientFlo had around 10 clients, I knew it was time to get help and a start to build a team.</p><p>As ClientFlo continued to grow, we moved to our first office.</p><figure id="w-node-679817d579f7-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f4ea500bc40bb28d71956d6_n4pj6bovIRI1ZU927m4iAqUKwOKelJ8HXRsUwG8iCIH4BzPYSoesJEqQTCL-cTFGd7A8Y9iHwnoAp9d3e2NpADmTuMVvcHv40o6sS8MHylx-fdS0ZH0urbWFkxevwhVfeJMxUDbW.jpeg" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p><strong>At the peak of the agency, what was the annual revenue and how many employees?</strong></p><p>Low seven-figures per year with about 5 full-time employees (including myself) and a couple contractors.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>How did you get initial sales for the agency?</strong></p><p>Straight <a href="https://jayvas.com/cold-calling-isnt-dead-and-why-all-entrepreneurs-should-learn-it/">cold-calling clients</a>. It was a grind, but ended up being very effective. I highly recommend all entrepreneurs to try cold-calling as early in their career as possible. It’s the “school of hard knocks” way to learn how to sell. And as any successful entrepreneur would tell you, the selling never stops - so get great at it!</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Describe the process of being a general investor from an agency operator?</strong></p><p>Investing, for me, started way before my agency, ClientFlo. The cash-flow from my agency accelerated the growth of my investments portfolio.</p><p>I started my investing career <a href="https://jayvas.com/charlie-munger-is-right-haul-ass-for-your-first-100k/">buying a cash-flowing real estate property</a>, which made it easier for me to quit my job and start ClientFlo. I continued to reinvest cash flows from ClientFlo into more real estate and stocks. As my cash flows and asset values continued to snowball, it enabled me to <a href="https://jayvas.com/investing/">invest in riskier/higher potential opportunities</a> like my <a href="https://www.starterstory.com/stories/how-we-re-expanding-our-product-line-and-growing-our-top-line">eCommerce business</a> and tech startups. I now manage a diversified portfolio of investments full-time.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>What are the major lessons you’ve learned from growing the agency?</strong></p><p>Since this was my first business, I quickly learned how to be an entrepreneur.&nbsp; In entrepreneurship, perseverance is key. Things are given to you and taken from you, so don't let either get to your head. Stay focused, enjoy the process, and have as much fun as possible.</p><p>An agency-specific lesson that I learned is - choose a niche industry as early as possible. We started off as a generalist PPC agency, but eventually specialized in the medical industry. There are a lot of generalist PPC agencies and therefore more competition. But becoming the expert in a specific industry gives you a competitive edge.&nbsp;</p><p>Having deep product knowledge in a specific industry allows you to service your clients better, which leads to more referrals, industry connections, and positions you as the go-to firm. Not to mention that specialist services are billed at a higher rate.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>What advice do you have for agency owners that want to use consulting revenues to fund new ventures?</strong></p><p>Not only are agencies great cash-flow businesses, they are also great <a href="https://jayvas.com/how-i-used-my-ppc-agency-as-an-idea-machine">idea generating machines</a>. If you are working with clients/industries that interest you, it won’t be long before you spot an opportunity that you can capitalize on.<br></p><p>Be curious and ask your clients a lot of questions to gain a deeper understanding of their business. Focus on your cash flows to help fund new ventures, and if you spot something -&nbsp;roll the dice. You never know what may become of it, unless you try!</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <div><p>MONTREAL -- 
	The Quebec government <a href="https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/quebec-hasn-t-released-official-data-on-school-outbreaks-and-hasn-t-said-when-it-will-do-so-1.5088184">hasn't said whether it will start updating the public</a> on COVID-19 cases in schools -- but some citizens don’t seem willing to wait.</p><p>
	
	A Montreal father who started a new crowd-sourced website meant to track school COVID-19 cases says it’s already garnered more than 100,000 page views.</p></div>
<p>
	By August, “I concluded we were going towards a second wave and our children would be in an experiment,” Olivier Drouin told CTV News.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	“I wanted to capture the data at the source and make it available to all parents [and] teachers, for them to make informed decisions about back-to-school.”</p>

<p>
	Last week, as French-language schools reopened, he launched a homemade site called <a href="https://www.covidecolesquebec.org/">Covid Ecoles Quebec</a> that allows the public to submit reports of coronavirus cases at schools across the province.</p>
<p>
	It provides a list, and a map, showing the cases Drouin has been able to confirm to his standards after his own basic verification process.</p>
<p>
	Of course, it’s not an exhaustive list, and he says if the government started releasing its own numbers, he’d stop collecting his—but after losing some trust in official numbers, he’d want to check first that they were doing a good job, he said in an email.</p>
<p>
	Drouin is vice-president of a technology company that provides high-tech human resources software. He lives in Montreal and has two daughters, one 13 and one 15, he said.</p>
<p>
	His site so far has published the names of 33 schools with at least one COVID-19 case each. Aside from the skyrocketing page views, Drouin said he’s gotten “hundreds of submissions” in the last week from parents and others.</p>
<p>
	“Not all are published,” he said, as sometimes “information is missing” or, in many cases, he gets duplicate reports for the same case.</p>
<p>
	Aside from the fact that it’s crowd-sourced, there are some important caveats to keep in mind for anyone looking at his site: for one thing, he doesn’t try to count the number of cases, but the number of schools, he said.</p>
<p>
	If he can confirm, to his standards, one case linked to a school, the school goes on the list. The government, meanwhile, counts an outbreak as two or more cases.</p>
<p>
	As for verification, the “easiest way to verify is with a copy of the letter schools send to all parents when a case occurs, as this is now mandatory across Quebec,” he said.</p>
<p>
	If he doesn’t have this, he said, “I look for media coverage.” Some of the schools listed on his website have a link to a news article.</p>
<p>
	The website also has a map showing where the affected schools are. These come with another caveat: at first glance, the map seems to show huge outbreaks, with dozens of numbers attached to the pinpoint for each school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	But those big numbers are not meant to show the number of cases, he said. They’re chronological to when he entered them, so a pinpoint showing “32,” for example, means it was the 32nd school he found, not that there are 32 cases there.</p>
<p>
	Drouin said his frustration with the government’s handling of the pandemic, and especially its transparency around data, had been growing for months before he thought of crowd-sourcing data.</p>
<p>
	“In particular, when schools reopened in May outside Montreal,” he said, “the government claimed a big success—however, no data was available to measure that.”</p>
<p>
	Quebecers only learned later that there were 41 cases linked to schools, he said. (That news was announced about two to three weeks after schools reopened.)</p>
<p>
	He believes that others have grown distrusting, too, due to a combination of government choices and data errors.</p>
<p>
	“Because the government fails to make this data available and accessible, it lacks transparency,” he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	“People don’t trust the numbers reported every day, as there have been so many data reporting issues,” he added, referencing the infamous fax machines used to collect infection reports, and the data that has been reported as misplaced or contaminated at various points.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Drouin said he’s not against kids going back to school, but he wanted more safety measures to be taken, including shrinking class sizes, improving ventilation, mandating masks in classes and giving more people the option of remote learning.</p>
<p>
	The Quebec government hasn’t said whether it’s even considering releasing data on COVID-19 cases at schools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	So far, the outbreaks that have been made public—including one involving <a href="https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/81-quebec-city-students-in-isolation-after-covid-19-cases-confirmed-at-two-schools-1.5086503">81 people at a Quebec City school</a> and <a href="https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/two-more-cases-of-covid-19-confirmed-quarantine-extended-for-20-quebec-teachers-in-isolation-1.5087658">a Deux-Montagnes outbreak</a> that has 20 teachers in quarantine—have been largely up to the media to confirm, with the cooperation of the schools and regional health authorities.</p>
<p>
	Drouin said he’d like it if the province did begin releasing routine data on schools.</p>
<p>
	“Based on the quality, accessibility of the data they would produce, yes, I would [shut my site down],” he said. “I have a day job.”</p>
                                              </div></div>]]>

September 2, 2020 | https://blog.jonlu.ca/posts/thoughts-on-product | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.jonlu.ca/posts/thoughts-on-product">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My day job is, officially, as a Growth Engineer working primarily on Unauth Product at Pinterest. It’s slightly different from my previous software engineering roles - typically, in other roles, I would be handed a spec sheet or design and had to implement it. Sometimes I’d design it myself, but the challenges were uniquely <em>technical</em> - I had to build something, and there was creativity in so far as what technologies and design patterns I’d use, but the features and product itself were usually dictated to you. They would either be so obvious that they were trivial, or they’d be handed down by some PM some point above the line.</p><p>Working on growth engineering is different - you’re responsible for the ideation and product, and focus around a north star metric, and can gauge the success of your ideas <em>objectively</em>. You own the entirety of the process, and have a quantifiable number at the end (for unauth and SEO, it’s usually traffic, time on site, and, most importantly, user acquisition).</p><p>This lends itself to an interesting focus at work every day. You want to build a product that is actually enjoyed and valuable to users, while still trying to “game” their attention and behavior.</p><p>The following are some thoughts I’ve had from working and consulting in growth at startups and companies of various sizes, mostly in the consumer tech space:</p><h2 id="thoughts-on-users-and-product">Thoughts on users and product</h2><ul><li><p>Trying to get users to do something is less like being an omnipotent god that tells people what to do than it is reshaping rivers of user intent. You can’t control what a user does, merely guide the flow of their actions. Adding a huge button doesn’t mean they’ll click on it.</p></li><li><p>Removing the ability to do something won’t prevent them from doing it (and will most likely just increase distaste for your product).</p></li><li><p>Users are simultaneously smarter and dumber than you think. Dumber in the sense that, when you take the average level of product comprehension for a user of any site that is used by a significant portion of the world population every day, it’s fairly low. Especially when you’re focused on new user acquisition, they don’t know what to expect, or how to use what you’re providing them. At the same time, though, they’re <strong>on your site for a reason</strong>, and usually know what they want.</p></li><li><p>You need to make sure to put yourself in the same headspace as your users. As someone building a product, you have to remember that you have a significantly higher familiarity with it than the people using it. You’ll have specific names for each product feature and know the user flows and reasoning behind each action, but for a lot of the people that visit your site, it’s their first time there.</p></li><li><p>It’s easy for me, as an early 20s San Francisco based software engineer, to have a fairly skewed perception of the world. Remember the user can have every possible demographic and characteristic.</p></li><li><p>Make sure you track what your users do when they come to your site, and experiment often with major shifts to your platform. It’s incredibly easy to <em>think</em> that users are doing something for a certain reason, when in reality it’s baseless.</p></li><li><p>Everything comes at a trade-off. Sometimes this is strictly better, metrics wise, but other times the trade-offs aren’t as clear - it doesn’t mean they don’t exist, though. The choices in button ordering, what you put above the fold, the font size, it all pulls and pushes the user experience in different directions.</p></li><li><p>Build for everyone, not just the professional. It’s easy when building products at work to be in a professional mindset - you’re not really thinking about <strong>every</strong> possible aspect that someone could be using your product for. Users get value in ways you never could predict - it’s better to build a platform that is flexible and ambiguous than imagine a single purpose use for what you’re building.</p></li><li><p>You do not and can not control users, and should view yourself more as at their mercy than them at yours. Working on a product is a lot more like swinging your arms around blindly in a room hoping you hit the light switch than it is knowing exactly what people want and how to deliver it to them.</p></li><li><p>Question all of your previous learnings. Something might’ve been true in the past, but is no longer. The same experiment or feature can lead to differences in results based on some slight change in the product or flow.</p></li></ul><h2 id="thoughts-on-growth">Thoughts on growth</h2><ul><li><p>Your user metrics are almost always proxies for what you’re trying to measure. You’ll pick some north star metric and say that this is what you’re building around, but this is just a shadow of what you’re trying to measure - the nebulous cloud of “user enjoyment”</p></li><li><p>Sometimes building a more aggressive user experience is worth it in the long run. For example: By default, your site could have a 2% conversion rate and a 20% bounce rate. A new feature is introduced behind an experiment that increases the conversion rate to 3%, but increases the bounce rate to 80%. This is clearly a subpar experience - it increases your bounce rate by 400%. However, it also increases your conversion rate by <strong>50%</strong>. Depending on your product this can make sense (for example, anything with an LTV for each user that is really high, or that has a really high CAC). It might not be ideal in the long term, but having a short term lever like this can be instrumental to a product’s success.</p></li><li><p>User growth is often cyclical. Some products will have the same traffic every day of the year, whereas others will have time of day, day of week, week of month, or seasonal patterns.</p></li><li><p>Monitor everything. As a product grows, you’ll build out one-off features that are significant wins at the time, but which aren’t actively monitored. It’s cheap to add a log to something and just page a team when it drops to 0. This is significantly eased by TDD, but TDD is rarely the right answer when your main concern is growth (you should move quickly).</p></li><li><p>You should move as quickly as possible. Don’t work on an idea for a long time - build out the smallest possible version that gives you directionality (positive or negative for the user metrics you’re looking at) and iterate from there. Especially in the early stages of a company, moving slowly and not adapting to shifting market conditions can kill you.</p></li><li><p>Growth is product + a direction + fuel. Each of these is a multiplier on the others - any combination of these can make a successful company. The dream is to have a great product that knows exactly where it wants to go, with all the resources it needs, but this is very rarely the case. More often than not you’ll have a mediocre product that’s floated along for a bit while being severely understaffed. If any of them is 0, you’re DOA.

        <p>Shell is the essential tool for every programmer. The more familiar you become with the available tools, the more efficient you can be with using your computer. Here's a list of command-line tools written in Rust that aim to provide modern, often much faster, alternatives to the existing shell commands.</p>
<h2 id="bat"><code>bat</code></h2>
<p><code>bat</code> is a <code>cat</code> clone with syntax highlighting and Git integration that works on Windows, MacOS and Linux. It provides syntax highlighting for many file extensions by default.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223573-9b9eb780-de0e-11ea-94e3-908957fe5a4e.png" alt="bat"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="exa"><code>exa</code></h2>
<p><code>exa</code> is a modern replacement for <code>ls</code>, the default command-line program in Unix/Linux for listing directory contents. <code>exa</code> supports icons with the <code>--icons</code> flag.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223612-aa856a00-de0e-11ea-8cec-133becefa6f2.png" alt="exa">
<a href="https://github.com/ogham/exa">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="fd"><code>fd</code></h2>
<p><code>fd</code> is a fast and user-friendly alternative to <code>find</code>, the built-in command-line program in Unix/Linux for walking a file hierarchy. <code>fd</code> provides opinionated defaults for the most common use cases. To find a specific file by name, you write <code>fd PATTERN</code> instead of <code>find -iname ‘*PATTERN*’</code>. <code>fd</code> is also extremely fast and it comes with a ton of options like ignoring hidden directories, files and patterns from <code>.gitignore</code> by default.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223646-bbce7680-de0e-11ea-98f4-0ef2d5f30920.png" alt="fd"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="procs"><code>procs</code></h2>
<p><code>procs</code> is a modern replacement for <code>ps</code>, the default command-line program in Unix/Linux for getting information about processes. It provides convenient, human-readable (and colored) output format by default.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223676-c8eb6580-de0e-11ea-8e3e-fea30f173aab.png" alt="procs"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dalance/procs">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="sd"><code>sd</code></h2>
<p><code>sd</code> is an intuitive find &amp; replace command-line tool, it is an alternative to <code>sed</code>, the built-in command-line program in Unix/Linux for parsing and transforming text (). <code>sd</code> has simpler syntax for replacing all occurrences and it uses the convenient regex syntax that you already know from JavaScript and Python. <code>sd</code> is also 2x-11x faster than <code>sed</code>.</p>
<p><code>sed</code> is a programmable text editor, with search and replace being a common use case. In that light, <code>sd</code> is more like <code>tr</code>, but on steroids. (thanks <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/oleid/">/u/oleid</a> for the suggestion).</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223698-d6a0eb00-de0e-11ea-85e7-7bf590794ac0.png" alt="sd"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/chmln/sd">GitHub</a></p>

<p>The minimal, blazing-fast, and infinitely customizable prompt for any shell.</p>
<p><a href="https://starship.rs/guide/">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="ripgrep"><code>ripgrep</code></h2>
<p><code>ripgrep</code> is an extremely fast alternative to <code>grep</code>, the built-in command-line program in Unix/Linux for searching files by pattern. <code>ripgrep</code> is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches your current directory for a regex pattern. By default, ripgrep respects <code>.gitignore</code> and automatically skips hidden files, directories and binary files.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223748-ecaeab80-de0e-11ea-9140-ac9219f5747c.gif" alt="ripgrep"></p>

<p>1st September 2020, by Elliott Brown</p>
<h4>Today we're announcing NUM, a new DNS-based protocol to store and retrieve structured data</h4>
<p>
  The Namespace Utility Modules (NUM) protocol can be used to store structured data for any domain name or email address. NUM&nbsp;records can be stored in the DNS of the independent NUM zone (e.g. <code>_num.example.com</code>) or in the hosted NUM zone (a DNS-based store of NUM records below the domain <code>num.net</code>) using a simple web interface: <a href="https://www.numserver.com/" target="_blank">NUM Server</a> <img src="https://www.num.uk/images/link-external.png" title="Content on another site." alt="Content on another site.">.
</p>
<p>
  We're announcing this experimental protocol to the technical community today and are very interested in feedback and input.
</p>
<h5>Custom and standardised records</h5>
<p>
  Custom NUM records can store structured data for any purpose, particular use cases are standardised with <a href="https://www.num.uk/modules">modules</a> <img src="https://www.num.uk/images/link-internal.png" title="Content elsewhere on this site." alt="Content elsewhere on this site.">. One of our leading use cases for NUM is contact information. Enabling organisations and individuals to store contact data in the DNS opens up lots of new possibilities like dialling a domain name or email address.
</p>
<h5>Automatically populating the DNS with millions of pieces of structured data</h5>
<p>
  As well as offering a simple, user-friendly way to adopt NUM, the NUM Server also helps overcome the chicken-and-egg problem. We&nbsp;intend to populate NUM records for millions of domain names based on website information hosted on those domain names. We&nbsp;expect to publish this data in early 2021.
</p>
<h5>Free, unrestricted and unlimited access to data</h5>
<p>
  Since NUM data is stored and served using DNS it's ultra-fast, reliable and massively scalable. Access to records on the NUM Server is free, unrestricted and unlimited forever. NUM enables organisations and individuals to take back control of their data and provides a valuable resource to developers building devices, apps and services.
</p>
<h5>Find out more</h5>

<h5>Experimenting with NUM</h5>

<h2 id="what-is-xls">What is XLS?</h2>
<p>The XLS (Accelerated HW Synthesis) project aims to enable the rapid development
of <em>hardware IP</em> that also runs as efficient <em>host software</em> via "software
style" methodology.</p>
<p>XLS implements a High Level Synthesis (HLS) toolchain which produces
synthesizable designs from flexible, high-level descriptions of functionality.
It is fully Open Source: Apache 2 licensed and developed via GitHub.</p>
<p>XLS is used inside of Google for generating feed-forward pipelines from
"building block" routines / libraries that can be easily retargeted, reused, and
composed in a latency-insensitive manner.</p>
<p><em>Not yet available</em>, but active work in progress is the implementation of XLS
<em>concurrent processes</em>, in Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) style, that
allow pipelines to communicate with each other and induct over time.</p>
<p>XLS is still experimental, undergoing rapid development, and not an officially
supported Google product. Expect bugs and sharp edges. Please help by trying it
out, <a href="https://github.com/google/xls/issues">reporting bugs</a>, and letting us know
what you think!</p>
<h2 id="building-from-source">Building From Source</h2>
<p>Currently, XLS must be built from source using the Bazel build system.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> Binary distributions of the XLS library are not currently available, but
we hope to enable them via continuous integration, <a href="https://github.com/google/xls/issues/108">see this issue</a>.</p>
<p>The following instructions are for the Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) Linux distribution.
Note that we start by assuming <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install-ubuntu.html">Bazel has been
installed</a>.</p>
<pre><code># Follow the bazel install instructions:
# https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install-ubuntu.html
#
# Afterwards we observe:

$ bazel --version
bazel 3.2.0

$ sudo apt install python3-dev python3-distutils python3-dev libtinfo5

# py_binary currently assume they can refer to /usr/bin/env python
# even though Ubuntu 20.04 has no `python`, only `python3`.
# See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8685

$ mkdir -p $HOME/opt/bin/
$ ln -s $(which python3) $HOME/opt/bin/python
$ echo 'export PATH=$HOME/opt/bin:$PATH' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc

$ bazel test -c opt ...
</code></pre>

<p>A reference build/test environment setup is also provided via <code>Dockerfile</code>:</p>
<pre><code>~$ git clone https://github.com/google/xls.git
~$ cd xls
~/xls$ docker build .  # Performs optimized build and test.
</code></pre>

<h2 id="stack-diagram-and-project-layout">Stack Diagram and Project Layout</h2>
<p>Navigating a new code base can be daunting; the following description provides a
high-level view of the important directories and their intended organization /
purpose, and correspond to the components in this XLS stack diagram:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><p>The phrase, "no man is an island," penned by English poet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Donne" rel="noopener" target="_self">John Donne</a> in the 17th century, and championed in Bon Jovi’s song, Santa Fe, offers insight into a hallmark of productive workplaces: the importance of collaboration. When people can work together in harmony to achieve goals and get into a flow, the output isn’t just better, the environment is too. A Stanford <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103114000420?via%3Dihub" rel="noopener" target="_self">study</a> found teams that work collaboratively report significantly higher levels of engagement, lower fatigue, and overall higher success rates.</p><p>These days, so many of our workstreams and processes are cross-functional and require some form of cooperation. Which is why a well run system of collaboration is critical to team effectiveness. And while collaboration in a shared workspace can be challenging, collaborating with a remote team can be even more daunting. Especially when the main reason your company decided to go remote is a global pandemic.</p><p>Working from home can often feel like you're on an island, separated from colleagues, and left to deal with complex problems on your own. Or to figure out how to connect with your team while being respectful of their time. For most of us, it feels more comfortable brainstorming and bouncing ideas off one another in person—partially because it's what's familiar. But how do we take this clearly beneficial activity (collaborating) that’s vital to achieving our goals, and make it work effectively in our remote world?</p><p>Understanding what makes collaboration useful and how to adapt your processes to improve the way you collaborate is a start. Also, it’s important to address root issues that can derail remote collaboration and to have fun while doing it. Being intentional about how you bring people together and rejiggering your operational processes is essential to making sure your team functions like a well-oiled machine.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/e422uarq/production/1372b1fa5071c46caf22a64a946dae10481353e7-2000x945.png?fm=jpg&amp;w=660&amp;dpr=2&amp;q=40" alt="What is remote collaboration?"></p><h3><strong></strong></h3><h2><strong>What is remote collaboration?</strong></h2><p>At the most basic level, collaboration is the act of working jointly with others. It's people with different perspectives, roles, and subject knowledge coming together to share and shape work. Ideally this effort leads to a result that is better—more effective, more efficient, more impactful—than if someone toiled away on their own.</p><p>From landing humankind on the moon to mending centuries old divides between countries, when collaboration works well, it can yield breakthroughs previously thought impossible.&nbsp; It can even create social networks that change the face of human interaction, connecting over <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-statistics-for-social-media-managers/" rel="noopener" target="_self">50% of the world's population or more than 3.8 billion people</a>.</p><h2><strong>Remote work has changed the way we collaborate</strong></h2><p>In the past, we've almost exclusively done collaboration in-person. Whether it's bringing teams together that are spread across the globe for offsites or hopping into a meeting room in the office and creating elaborate "brainstorming art" on the whiteboard for all to see.</p><p>However, the way we work has shifted in the last few years—accelerated by the adoption of remote work due to COVID-19. But just because your entire team is dispersed, doesn't mean that collaboration is any less meaningful or critical&nbsp; to your team's success.</p><p>So, how do you make sure your team can still collaborate, and do it effectively? To avoid being one of the <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/06/75-of-cross-functional-teams-are-dysfunctional" rel="noopener" target="_self">75% of cross functional teams</a> that are dysfunctional because they lack a systemic approach to working together, we’ve put together 5 actionable tactics you can put into practice stat.<br></p><h3><strong>1) Know how and when to collaborate synchronously</strong></h3><p>Planning an office collaboration session typically involves finding time on people's calendars, booking a room, and making sure there are dry-erase markers for the meeting. For better or for worse, you and your team let the magic of being in one place for a singular purpose take over from there.</p><p>However, for remote collaboration to work well, there's an added element to keep in mind: being intentional when it comes to topics and outcomes. Without many of the same organic interpersonal cues that creative work sessions provide, being clear and upfront about what everyone hopes to get out of the session and how folks can help is essential.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/e422uarq/production/bd25745327c1a3485da1464ff7ad43f662089347-2000x945.jpg?fm=jpg&amp;w=660&amp;dpr=2&amp;q=40" alt="Planning for your remote collaborate ahead of time"></p><p>One way to do this is to encourage attendees to prepare a topic, a goal, and what type of input would be most useful ahead of time. This tactic will help keep the group focused and make sure you're maximizing time.</p><p>At the end of the session, do a recap to see if it was successful. Ask these two questions: "Has this session pushed the project forward in a meaningful way?" And "Do owners feel more prepared or have clear directives to tackle the challenges in front of them?"</p><p>It should be noted that not all real-time collaboration sessions need to conclude with clear action items to be meaningful. But this should be stated at the outset and the goal should reflect this as well.</p><p>Before you close Google Hangouts, Zoom, or Microsoft Teams, take a moment to assess how things went in terms of process and if there's something everyone would like to do differently in the next session. Iteration is an important part of the process.</p><p>Speaking of next time, another item to consider is the cadence or frequency of your collaboration sessions. These structured meetings for creative problem solving not only serve the purpose of pushing projects forward using your team's hive mind—in lieu of an office—they are a way to <a href="https://www.cmswire.com/social-business/energize-you-enterprise-with-collaboration/" rel="noopener" target="_self">connect and energize the team</a>.</p><p>Try hosting collaboration sessions twice a week, weekly, or every two weeks to determine what makes the most sense for your remote team. At the beginning, keep it consistent so that everyone gets used to the format and make the appropriate adjustments as you go along.</p><p><a href="https://unsplash.com/@headwayio" rel="noopener" target="_self"><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/e422uarq/production/11eb91a1a0ac7f3a9e3168358fef18c7a66cd8d3-5472x3648.jpg?fm=jpg&amp;w=660&amp;dpr=2&amp;q=40" alt="Man communicating with his hands during collaboration."></a></p><p>Photo by Headway on Unsplash</p><h3><strong>2) Document your processes</strong></h3><p>When it comes to collaborating as a remote team, a shared understanding of process makes all the difference. This doesn't mean adding one new process after another. Instead, update your old processes for the remote context to help your team set expectations and be accountable to one another. It will give everyone a roadmap on how best to interact and communicate, and also take the guesswork out of <a href="https://www.range.co/blog/remote-onboarding-tips">onboarding new team members</a>.</p><p>One way to put a standard in place is to create a handbook—using a shared doc— that includes details about the best ways to communicate different types of messages and request feedback.</p><p>Think of it as a living document that can be updated as you test and learn how to best run your remote collaboration sessions. It should also add more color about how best to engage with someone on the team. Because everyone is working in very different environments, it can be difficult to know what impact having school-aged children doing remote learning or a roommate who hosts online fitness classes in the apartment will have on someone’s availability to collaborate. As things change, you’ll continue to update and evolve this document.</p><h3><strong>3) Make asynchronous collaboration a strength</strong></h3><p>One of the truly unique benefits of working remotely is leaning into collaborating asynchronously. In other words, being able to share and connect on topics and projects at the convenience of each team member and their schedules.</p><p>The staggered nature of asynchronous communication is a particular asset when you’re trying to keep the number of meetings down, while still ensuring everyone is in the loop and contributing. It will make your team more flexible and able to adjust to external influences more readily.</p><p>Start with the basics. There are a ton of tools and apps that make staying in sync when you’re not collaborating in real-time easy, like Google Docs, Asana, and Range. Build a culture of using comments and channels that allow people to share without being in the same place at the same time.<br></p><h3><strong>4) Your remote collaboration tool belt</strong></h3><p>Tools! They make collaborating across spaces and timezones possible. We’ve written about the <a href="https://www.range.co/blog/collaboration-tools-slack">magic of integrations</a> and how tools like Range are designed not to just facilitate remote collaboration, but also strengthen team culture every day with features like team building questions and sharing a mood with an emoji. Here a few other tools to have that will slot right into your new framework. </p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/e422uarq/production/49f172ea53d27bac3468d4c70b7fa2a5e8c6fd10-747x539.png?fm=jpg&amp;w=330&amp;dpr=2&amp;q=40" alt="App integrations in Range"></p><ul><li><a href="https://slack.com/" rel="noopener" target="_self">Slack</a> - business communication platform</li><li><a href="https://www.range.co/">Range</a> - team success platform that keeps teams connected and on track</li><li><a href="https://gsuite.google.com/" rel="noopener" target="_self">G Suite</a> - full suite of office productivity tools</li><li><a href="https://asana.com/" rel="noopener" target="_self">Asana</a>, <a href="https://trello.com/home" rel="noopener" target="_self">Trello</a>, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira" rel="noopener" target="_self">Jira</a>, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/" rel="noopener" target="_self">GitLab</a>, <a href="https://github.com/" rel="noopener" target="_self">GitHub</a> - project management and file tracking tools</li><li><a href="https://mural.co/" rel="noopener" target="_self">Mural</a> -<strong> </strong>whiteboarding app<br></li></ul><h3><strong>5) All work and no play makes for dull collaboration</strong></h3><p>While collaborating remotely is undoubtedly about getting work done, you can still have a little bit of fun while you're at it. In fact, adding fun into the mix can help strengthen ties between your team and encourage engagement.</p><p>Playing a <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ice-breaker-games" rel="noopener" target="_self">quick game</a>, answering an <a href="https://icebreaker.range.co/" rel="noopener" target="_self">icebreaker</a>, or putting on music to kick things off are great ways to include levity and get people in the spirit of creative problem solving. Test different ones, rotate them around, and collectively figure out what works to get your team into the best collaboration mode.</p><h3><strong>Go forth and collaborate!</strong></h3><p>Now that you’re armed with these five tips on how to work better together as a team, it’s time to go reimagine the way your remote team collaborates. But the fun doesn’t stop once you’re safely back in the office—you should continue many of these practices when you’re co-located again. At the heart of this exercise is improving how you collaborate in general. Afterall all, great remote collaboration is just great collaboration.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/e422uarq/production/25a15bef9b76411971fd43c5d8a52fcb76f43685-480x270.gif" alt="Christina Tosi saying teamwork on Master Cher"></p><hr><p><a href="https://range.co/signup">Sign up for Range</a></p></div></div></section></div>]]>

</span><span>Videos</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>and</span> 
</span><span>Texts</span><span work="" sans";"=""><span>. The posts are similar enough that they will share certain attributes (like a title), but also different enough that they will require unique columns (a url column for video). In addition, we want to have a newsfeed feature where we display all posts by most recently created. This means we need to have a way to query across the entire</span> 
</span><span>Posts</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>architecture.</span></span></p><p><span work="" sans";"=""><span>This problem is generally solved in one of two ways in Rails:</span> 
</span><span>single table inheritance</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>(STI) or</span> 
</span><span>abstract classes</span><span>. Since ActiveRecord models do not have to be backed by a database table, these solutions leverage Plain Old Ruby Objects in order to represent this inheritance hierarchy. Polymorphic associations also often get thrown into the mix but don't quite fit our use case (we’ll briefly touch on this). We’ll discuss the pros and cons of each of these approaches and shed light on a new Rails feature that combines the best of both worlds.</span></p>  
  
 <h4><span>Single Table Inheritance (STI)</span></h4> 
  
<p><span work="" sans";"=""><span>In an STI implementation, attributes are stored in a single parent class table and a</span> 
</span><span>type</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>column holds the name of the subclass for the given row. Subclasses inherit from the parent class which allows us to write Text specific methods on the Text class without polluting the Video class.&nbsp; Generating a newsfeed is also very straightforward since all the data is in a single table, i.e. we can do things like</span> 
</span><span>Posts.order(created_at: :desc)</span><span>.<br></span><span><br></span></p></div> <p><a id="1268435434" data-caption="STI example"><img src="https://lirp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/8a8eebaa/dms3rep/multi/opt/Screen+Shot+2020-08-02+at+11.00.04+AM-1920w.png" alt="" id="1798209722" data-dm-image-path="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/8a8eebaa/dms3rep/multi/Screen+Shot+2020-08-02+at+11.00.04+AM.png" onerror="handleImageLoadError(this)"></a> 
</p> 
 <div data-dmtmpl="true" data-element-type="paragraph" data-version="5" id="1828567217" data-uialign="center"><p><span>STI is simple to implement but can quickly get unwieldy as slight differences in models introduce new fields.&nbsp; This leads to wide tables that are full of null values storing information for a collection of now distinct models that are forced to share the same table.</span></p>  
 <h4><span>Abstract Classes</span></h4> 
  
<p><span>Abstract Classes solve the problem of wide tables by giving each model its own table and connecting them via an Abstract Base Model - the parent class cannot be instantiated and must be subclassed to be utilized. Where the entire hierarchy was represented in a single table in STI, the opposite is true using abstract classes.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span work="" sans";"=""><span>This gives us the ability to separate unique attributes to distinct tables, but now we have the opposite problem - repetitive columns. The</span> 
</span><span>author</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>and</span> 
</span><span>title</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>columns will have to be included in all subclasses. We have also lost the ability to query across the entire hierarchy (i.e.</span> 
</span><span>Posts.all</span><span work="" sans";"=""><span>), making our newsfeed unnecessarily cumbersome.</span> 
</span></p></div>

</p> 
  
 <p><span>We've established that both methods have their strengths but are not without significant drawbacks. So what's the solution?</span></p> 
  
 <div data-dmtmpl="true" data-element-type="paragraph" data-version="5" id="1670289024" data-uialign="center"> <h4><span>Delegated Types</span></h4> 
  
<p><span><span>*At the time of writing, this feature is only included in edge Rails and is expected to be included in the next minor release (6.1.0). However,</span> 
</span><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/39341" target="_blank" runtime_url="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/39341" type="url">the code</a><span> <span>can be pulled from the Rails codebase and included in ApplicationRecord to be used right away*</span></span></p><p><span>Delegated types take the best of STI and abstract classes and merge them into a single solution. Both the superclass and subclasses are backed by database tables, allowing for common attributes to live in the parent class table and unique attributes to live in the subclass tables.</span><span><br></span></p></div>

 <div data-dmtmpl="true" data-element-type="paragraph" data-version="5" id="1860625639" data-uialign="center"><p><span work="" sans";"=""><span>So what's happening here? By including</span> 
</span><span>delegated_type :postable</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>on the</span> 
</span><span>Post</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>model, it adds a polymorphic belongs_to relationship to</span> 
</span><span>postable</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>under the hood. So far, this is the same as setting up a regular polymorphic association minus the syntactical difference. However, where polymorphic relationships define an interface for a “has_many” relationship, delegated types define an interface for “has_one”. That distinction is what allows us to isolate shared attributes in a separate table, but still be able to retrieve values specific to a delegated type row.&nbsp;</span></span></p></div>

</span><span>can</span><span single-space="true"> <span></span> 
</span><span>be</span><span> <span>commented on” vs “X and Y models are</span> 
</span><span>types</span><span> <span>of comments”.</span></span></p><p><span><br>Going back to delegated types, creating a new Video record looks something like this:</span></p></div>

<b>Summary</b>: In this course we explain how category theory—a branch of mathematics known for its ability to organize the key abstractions that structure much of the mathematical universe—has become useful for writing elegant and maintainable code. In particular, we'll use examples from the Haskell programming language to motivate category-theoretic constructs, and then explain these constructs from a more abstract and inclusive viewpoint. Hands-on programming exercises will be used to demonstrate categorical ideas like "the universal property of products" in working Haskell code. A rough list of topics includes: 
</p><ol>
<li>Sets, types, categories, functors, natural transformations</li>
<li>Universal constructions and associated data types</li>
<li>Adjunctions and cartesian closed categories</li>
<li>Algebras, catamorphisms, anamorphisms</li>
<li>Monads, comonads, Kleisli arrows</li>
<li>Monoids, monoidal categories, lax monoidal functors, applicatives</li>
<li>Profunctors, (co)ends, optics</li>
</ol>
<b>We will assume no background knowledge on behalf of the student</b>, starting from scratch on both the programming and mathematics.

The aging heavy lifter, which will be phased out and replaced by <a href="https://www.ulalaunch.com/rockets/vulcan-centaur" target="_blank">Vulcan</a> over the next few years, had a <a href="https://twitter.com/torybruno/status/1299623698090135552" target="_blank">T-3 sec hotfire abort</a> complete with a dramatic fireball (<a href="https://youtu.be/1jkjgo0Cs_8" target="_blank">video</a>). The rocket and payload are undamaged, but launch is delayed a week or more while expendable ground systems are replaced. Next up was SpaceX, launching <a href="https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/saocom-1.htm" target="_blank">SAOCOM-1B</a> into a polar orbit, the <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2020/08/spacex-polar-cape-50-years/" target="_blank">first such southward flight path from Florida since 1969</a> when <a href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/tech-and-science/science/herd-shot-around-the-world-the-last-east-coast-polar-launch/article/567614" target="_blank">booster debris landed on Cuba</a> and <a href="https://www.mapfreglobalrisks.com/risks/images/Seguros_de_satelites_ENU_tcm1366-435032.pdf" target="_blank">killed a cow named Rufina</a> 🐮. Returning to this flight path was only possible due to the Falcon 9’s automated self-destruct systems—rocket exhaust in this flight path can block manually radioed abort messages. This launch was also temporarily halted due to its overflight of ULA’s aborted NROL-44 payload (expensive!) and required last minute approval from the NRO. To cap the weekend off,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rocketlabusa.com/missions/completed-missions/i-cant-believe-its-not-optical/" target="_blank">Rocket Lab returned to flight with their 14th mission</a> (and announced that they will be conducting a first soft ocean splashdown of the booster for their 17th mission). Their&nbsp;<em>I Can’t Believe It’s Not Optical</em> mission was a dedicated launch for <a href="https://www.capellaspace.com/technology" target="_blank">Capella Space</a>, a startup focused on capturing 0.5 m resolution <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic-aperture_radar" target="_blank">synthetic aperture radar</a> (SAR) data as a service, the first of an eight satellite constellation. (<em>Ed., amusingly, this satellite was originally supposed to launch as a rideshare with SAOCOM-1B, but when that mission was delayed, Capella switched to Rocket Lab, which was then delayed by a July 4th failure, eventually launching just a few hours after the original mission. You just can’t get ahead. </em>🤷‍♂️)</p></div><!--[if mso]> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]></table><![endif]--></div><div> <!--[if mso]><table align="left" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" style="width:100%;"><tr> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]><td valign="top" width="600" style="width:600px;"> <![endif]--><div><p><a href="#etc">¶</a><strong id="etc">Etc.</strong></p><ul><li>Explore Mars has <a href="https://www.exploremars.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/H2MR_2020_Web_v1.pdf" target="_blank">released their annual Humans to Mars report</a> detailing progress towards human exploration of the planet in the 2030s.</li><li>The US Department of Education has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ctemissioncubesat.com/" target="_blank">announced a CubeSat mission design and prototyping challenge for High School students</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>By now, we all have learned to work with Zoom, GMeet, and other online tools. But what’s going on in the event industry? How do organizers attract speakers and grow their audience for online events? I interviewed Oli Makhasoeva – the main organizer of the biggest Haskell online event, Haskell Love Conference, in which <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/haskell-to-core">our developer Vlad had a chance to participate in</a>.</em></p><p><em>We talk about their experience organizing Haskell Love, how they kept it accessible for developers of all levels, and what things one should definitely keep in mind when organizing an online conference.</em></p><p><strong>– Hi Oli, first of all, thank you for organizing the biggest Haskell online event! How did it go from your point of view?</strong></p><p>Thank you! We were relatively lucky; no major incidents, although we had some technical challenges. On the first day, we were unable to use our remote desktop, but we were fortunate enough to have a backup. Otherwise, the conference went amazing: a lot of participation from the audience, endless chats; the statistics say we had more than 2000 unique attendees. Many people reached out directly and thanked us for the event – the Haskell community is truly friendly and welcoming. We were happy to see people having conversations during the event at the Hallway track: not only about Haskell, but also about technology and life in general.</p><p><strong>– Tell us about your team of organizers. How did you decide to work together and create the Haskell Love Conference?</strong></p><p>I am proud to say it’s a women organized conference! Most of us know each other for quite a while, from university times. We have Elena who is responsible for planning, Ida who held communications, Margarita worked with sponsors. All of them are professionals, and I am happy to have them. What’s also important, our volunteers had a wide variety of skills and did an amazing job staffing the conference and inspiring others.</p><p>The idea to organize Haskell Love came after we organized the Scala Love conference together. We thought – why not spread the love further to other communities? To achieve this goal, we started a company called <a href="https://konfy.care/">Konfy</a>. Our motto is “Konfy - make your conference comfortable”. Our conferences will always be virtual and free to attend. &lt;3
<img src="https://serokell.io/files/nf/nfjjia3k.oli.png" alt="Oli Makhasoeva"></p><p><strong>– The website says that the conference accepts people with monad-o-phobia. ;) How do you make Haskell events exciting and accessible for everyone, no matter the level of experience the audience has?</strong></p><p>Our program committee worked hard on making sure we included talks of different levels. However, we did not properly promote the level of the talks. We should have tagged all the talks and let people know the levels of the sessions. Action item for the next conference is created! We know how to make it better :)</p><p><strong>– What are the main pros and cons of online conferences vs. offline ones? Are there any specific things you did to make the online conference feel more like the offline one?</strong></p><p>Unlike offline ones, online conferences are accessible from everywhere to anyone with the internet (we even provided a low res streaming option because it was requested by someone with a weak internet connection). You can cover multiple time zones! No dietary restriction problems! Zero CO<sub>2</sub> footprint! And a bigger audience for sponsors! :) These are the advantages of virtual events.</p><p>At an offline event, we gather people in a conference room. You go to a closed place, focus on a speaker, and emerge with new insights. In the case of online events, you think: “I’ll watch a talk and do my other stuff so I don’t lose time.” But let’s be honest, it is harder to concentrate on an FP-oriented talk when you do something simultaneously. To help people to focus and to make our conference feel more like the offline one, we are trying to create an interactive and engaging environment at everyone’s home. That is, we are trying to immerse the person into the atmosphere of the conference with Q&amp;A rooms, the Hallway track, and the Twitter live stream. According to the feedback we got, we didn’t fail, but there is room for improvement.</p><p><strong>– The conference featured many impressive names such as Philip Wadler, Simon Peyton Jones, and others. How did you gather so many bright minds in one place?</strong></p><p>The Haskell community is full of enthusiasts who are willing to spend their time on a free conference and help the community. Speakers were awesome and supported our desire to gather Haskellers from around the world (also, they wanted to get our avatar 😉).</p><p><strong>– What is the most challenging thing in organizing an event like that?</strong></p><p>Building a flow for attendees: Q&amp;A sessions, the Hallway track, announcements, participation, how to move between them, and where to find information about each activity. We still need to improve that part a lot: people were confused by time zones, it wasn’t easy for them to keep track of so many places, etc.</p><p><strong>– To finish it up: what would be one piece of advice you would give to all who want to organize their own FP event?</strong></p><p>Indeed, it was challenging, and we had to scramble, so we’d like to share what we learned in order to help others who are thinking about whether and how to host large events in the coming months: facilitation is the key. Investing in tools to make the sessions as interactive as possible, call-outs for questions before/during, live polls, etc. Don’t let people be silent and just watch a video, make an experience where many people get the feel of a community. If you need help with organizing an online event, reach out to us at <a href="mailto:info@konfy.care">info@konfy.care</a>!</p><p>Many thanks to all who participated in this conference, we enjoyed it a lot and will come back next year! Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/_haskellove">Twitter</a> to be up to date with our plans. And don’t be upset if you missed the event, the videos are already out on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Konfy">our Youtube channel</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><img src="https://www.karimarttila.fi/img/2020-09-01-using-clojure-in-command-line-with-babashka_img_1.png" alt="Ordinary Clojure code"></p>

<p><em>Ordinary Clojure code - can be run in REPL or in command line with Babashka (the whole file can be found <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres/bb_postgres.clj">here</a> )</em></p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>I never bothered to learn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)">Bash</a> so that I could be really fluent with it. If I needed anything beyond basic Bash stuff I immediately used <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> in command-line scripting.</p>

<p>I’m currently implementing my Clojure simple server again, this time using the <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/integrant">Integrant</a> library. In this new version, I implemented three data stores: CSV, AWS DynamoDB, and Postgres. I had already implemented importing development data into DynamoDB (using Python), this time I used <a href="https://github.com/borkdude/Babashka">Babashka</a> to import development data into Postgres - mainly just to have an excuse to try if I could replace Python with Clojure when scripting something with Bash.</p>

<p>The scripts can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure">Clojure git</a> repo in directory <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/tree/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres">postgres</a>.</p>

<h3 id="developing-with-babashka">Developing with Babashka</h3>

<p>The really neat thing with Babashka is that you can develop your Babashka scripts as part of your Clojure project, or independently but using your favorite Clojure IDE. The picture above shows Clojure code in my favorite Clojure IDE, <a href="https://cursive-ide.com/">Cursive</a>. I have the Clojure code that imports data into the Postgres database in directory <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/tree/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres">postgres</a>, so I have the following extra path in my <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/deps.edn">deps.edn</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span> </span><span>:postgres</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>:extra-paths</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"postgres"</span><span>]}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then the nice thing is that I can develop the Clojure code as part of project’s other Clojure code. Let’s first create a short bash script that tells Babashka to run your Clojure code with a flag so that we know in the Clojure code when we are running the code using Babashka or using Clojure IDE REPL (file <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres/run-bb-load-data.sh">run-bb-load-data.sh</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#/bin/bash</span>

<span>export </span><span>POSTGRES_PASSWORD</span><span>=</span>simpleserver
<span>export </span><span>RUNNING_BB</span><span>=</span>TRUE
bb bb_postgres.clj
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The flag is the <code>RUNNING_BB</code> export above.</p>

<p>Then in the Clojure code we have a top level form <code>(run-me)</code> in the namespace (file <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres/bb_postgres.clj">bb_postgres.clj</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>run-me</span><span> </span><span>[]</span><span>
  </span><span>"Loads data only if running from Babashka script which sets the environment variable.
  We don't want the repl to load the data when reloading the namespace.
  In repl experimentation use the rich comment below."</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>running-bb?</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>System/getenv</span><span> </span><span>"RUNNING_BB"</span><span>)]</span><span>
    </span><span>(</span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>running-bb?</span><span> </span><span>"TRUE"</span><span>)</span><span>
      </span><span>(</span><span>import-data</span><span>))))</span><span>

</span><span>(</span><span>run-me</span><span>)</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I.e. when reloading the namespace REPL runs the code but if the flag is not set it doesn’t actually do anything - it imports the code only if we are running the code using Babashka. The reason for this is that when I reload the namespace as part of my Clojure workflow I don’t want the data import to happen. For development purposes to test importing data, or any other function, I have a <code>rich comment</code> at the end of the file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>comment</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>data-dir</span><span> </span><span>"dev-resources/data"</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>get-raw-products</span><span> </span><span>data-dir</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>get-product-groups</span><span> </span><span>data-dir</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>do</span><span>
    </span><span>(</span><span>delete-products!</span><span>)</span><span>
    </span><span>(</span><span>delete-product-groups!</span><span>))</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>vals</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>get-users</span><span> </span><span>data-dir</span><span>))</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>load-users</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>vals</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>get-users</span><span> </span><span>data-dir</span><span>)))</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>import-data</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>db-get-all-product-groups</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>db-get-all-products</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>)</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>comment</code> block is here so that REPL does not run this code when reloading, of course. The function calls you see inside the comment block are just experiments added in no particular order. I can send any of these forms individually to be evaluated in the REPL - a typical Clojure trick when developing with REPL.</p>

<h3 id="babashka-use-cases">Babashka Use Cases</h3>

<p>I really like the idea that I can now use Clojure in shell scripting. Of course I could use Clojure in shell scripting also without Babashka but JVM boot takes quite a long time which makes testing of the script in command line a bit painful. Not so with Babashka - Babashka boots lightning fast:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>λ&gt; <span>time </span>bb <span>'(println "Hello world!")'</span>
Hello world!

real	0m0.006s
user	0m0.003s
sys	0m0.003s
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The use cases using Babashka in my personal scripting probably is a bit like I used Babashka to import data into the Postgres database in this exercise:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>run-sql</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>command</span><span>]</span><span>

</span><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>insert-product-group!</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>product-group</span><span>]</span><span>

<p>I.e. parsing CSV, transforming data, and then call some program with the transformed data, possibly read what was returned and do other stuff. You could possibly do all this using plain old Bash but I never bothered to learn Bash in that level that I can do more than test some flags and call other programs using Bash.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-i-use-the-babashka-script-in-this-exercise">How Do I Use the Babashka Script in This Exercise?</h3>

<p>I used Babashka to load development data into the Postgres data store. During development I built a custom Postgres image and provided a <a href="https://github.com/casey/just">Just</a> recipe to start the data store (file <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/Justfile">Justfile</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Start local postgres</span>
@postgres:
    <span>cd </span>postgres <span>&amp;&amp;</span> ./run-docker-compose.sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres/run-docker-compose.sh">run-docker-compose.sh</a> starts the Postgres docker container, creates the schema and finally calls <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres/run-bb-load-data.sh">./run-bb-load-data.sh</a> which loads the data into the development Postgres data store:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env bash</span>

<span>echo</span> <span>"NOTE: Remember to destroy the container if running again!"</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>"Starting docker compose..."</span>

<span>sleep </span>5
<span>echo</span> <span>"Creating Simple Server schemas..."</span>
./create-schema.sh
<span>sleep </span>1
<span>echo</span> <span>"Loading data..."</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="clojure-babashka-vs-python-in-shell-scripting">Clojure (Babashka) vs Python in Shell Scripting</h3>

<p>Let’s finally compare Python and Clojure (Babashka) when doing some Linux shell scripting.</p>

<p><strong>Easiness</strong>. Both languages are pretty easy and fast to work if you have used them. Developing Python scripts is pretty fast - you just run the script in command line. Working with Clojure has one additional plus: you can use the Clojure REPL.</p>

<p><strong>Library support</strong>: Python wins. When you are scripting in Python and you realize that it would be nice e.g. to use some AWS library - just use it (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/dynamodb/pysrc/table_importer.py">table_importer.py</a> - the AWS <a href="https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html">boto3</a> library). The library support for Babashka is not as extensive, of course - but Babashka supports quite many namespaces outside <code>clojure.core</code> and also some additional libraries: <a href="https://github.com/borkdude/babashka#built-in-namespaces">Babashka built-in namespaces</a> - keep eye on that page, maybe Babashka library support is growing in the future!</p>

<p>So, the library support might not be as good as with Python. But I really do love Clojure and if I’m implementing apps using Clojure it is really nice to do some ad hoc scripting using Babashka.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>It’s nice to have another scripting tool in my toolbox: <a href="https://github.com/borkdude/babashka">Babashka</a>. Time will tell if I start using Clojure instead of Python as my preferred scripting language, thanks to Babashka. At least in this exercise Babashka did really well.</p>

                <!-- Toc if any -->

<p>Once <a href="https://www.cloudforecast.io/blog/aws-tagging-best-practices/" target="_blank">you have adopted an AWS tagging strategy</a>, you’ll need to make sure that all your existing AWS resources and any new ones you create abide by it. Consistency is the key - if you don’t proactively enforce your AWS tagging strategy, you’ll always be playing catch up and chasing down team members to make sure they add the right tags to their resources.</p>

<p>While you can apply AWS tags to your resources manually using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/resourcegroupstaggingapi/tag-resources.html" target="_blank">AWS CLI</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/tag-editor.html" target="_blank">AWS Tag Editor</a>, you’ll probably find this cumbersome and error-prone at scale. A better approach is to automatically apply AWS tags to your resources and use rules to enforce their consistent usage.</p>

<p>Depending on the tool you use to maintain your infrastructure on AWS, your method of proactively enforcing AWS tags on new resources may vary. In this guide, I’ll highlight two tools: Terraform and AWS CloudFormation. You’ll see how to use each to create and update AWS cost allocation tags on your resources and then enforce the proper use of specific tags for new resources. By proactively enforcing your AWS tagging strategy, you’ll minimize your time spent auditing and correcting improper AWS tags and force developers to learn best AWS tagging best practices for your environment.</p>



<p>The first infrastructure management tool I’ll cover is <a href="https://www.terraform.io/" target="_blank">Terraform</a>. Terraform works across a variety of cloud hosting providers to help you provision and maintain your AWS resources. With Terraform, you can define your servers, databases, and networks in code and apply your changes programmatically to your AWS account.</p>

<p>If you’re new to Terraform, they have a well-documented <a href="https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/intro" target="_blank">Getting Started guide</a> and several <a href="https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/tree/master/examples" target="_blank">AWS template examples on GitHub</a>. In this section, I’ll show you some snippets from a demo Terraform project and module that <a href="https://github.com/CloudForecast/cf-terraform-demo" target="_blank">is available on GitHub</a>. You’ll learn the following in this Terraform AWS tags:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Tag a New AWS EC2 Instance with Terraform</li>
  <li>Using Terraform to Update Existing AWS Tags</li>
  <li>Enforce AWS Tags with Terraform</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="tag-a-new-aws-ec2-instance-with-terraform">Tag a New AWS EC2 Instance with Terraform</h3>

<p>If you want to deploy an EC2 instance with AWS Tags using Terraform, your configuration might include something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19
20
21
22
23
24
25
26
27
28
29
30
31
</pre></td><td><pre>resource "aws_instance" "cart" {
  connection {
    type = "ssh"
    user = "ubuntu"
    host = self.public_ip
    private_key = file(var.private_key_path)
  }

  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  ami = var.aws_amis[var.aws_region]

  key_name = aws_key_pair.auth.key_name

  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.default.id]

  subnet_id = aws_subnet.default.id

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "sudo apt-get -y update",
      "sudo apt-get -y install nginx",
      "sudo service nginx start",
    ]
  }
  tags = {
    contact = "j-mark"
    env = "dev"
    service = "cart"
  }
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above example includes three AWS cost allocation tags: <code>contact</code>, <code>env</code>, and <code>service</code> with values described as strings. When you <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/apply.html" target="_blank">apply this configuration</a>, Terraform will connect to AWS and deploy an EC2 instance having the AWS tags you specified.</p>

<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_11675783F6270CC3362B9903B770D88B278C2B2D779D11551760688B8EA1DFC4_1596383259429_cf-2020-08-02-a.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="using-terraform-to-update-existing-aws-tags">Using Terraform to Update Existing AWS Tags</h3>

<p>Terraform makes it easy to update already existing resources with AWS tags in reversible and consistent ways. If you’re using AWS tags to keep track of a resource’s contact (e.g.: <code>j-mark</code> in the above example), you’re likely to need to update the AWS tag when the team member leaves or changes roles.</p>

<p>To update the AWS tags on your resource, simply update the corresponding tags in your Terraform configuration. The new tags will overwrite any previous tags assigned to the resource, including tags added outside of Terraform.</p>

<p>For example, to change the <code>contact</code> cost allocation tag on the EC2 instance above, you might update the <code>tags</code> block above with the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre>tags = {
  contact = "l-duke"
  env = "dev"
  service = "cart"
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>When you apply this configuration, the AWS tags will be automatically updated in the AWS console:</p>

<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_11675783F6270CC3362B9903B770D88B278C2B2D779D11551760688B8EA1DFC4_1596383277121_cf-2020-08-02-b.png" alt=""></p>

<p>If you keep your Terraform configuration files in version control - which is probably a good idea - you will be able to see how tags have changed over time. You can also review changes using the same code review process that your application code goes through to help you catch mistakes in the execution of your tagging strategy.</p>

<h3 id="enforce-aws-tags-with-terraform">Enforce AWS Tags with Terraform</h3>

<p>As your infrastructure grows, a code review process likely won’t be enough to prevent improper AWS tagging. Fortunately, you can enforce AWS tag names and values using <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html" target="_blank">variables</a> and custom validation rules in Terraform.</p>

<p>In the examples above, the <code>tags</code> list was hard-coded into the EC2 instance definition. A more scalable pattern would be to break your EC2 instance template into its own <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/modules.html" target="_blank">module</a> and use a <code>tags</code> variable. You can then write a <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html#custom-validation-rules" target="_blank">custom validation rule</a> to check that the tags comply with your strategy.</p>

<p>For example, if you want to check that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The user specifies at least one tag</li>
  <li>The <code>contact</code> tag is either <code>j-mark</code> or <code>l-duke</code></li>
  <li>The <code>env</code> tag is set</li>
  <li>The <code>service</code> tag is either <code>cart</code> or <code>search</code></li>
</ol>

<p>You might create a module with a variable specified like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
</pre></td><td><pre>variable "tags" {
  description = "The tags for this resource."
  validation {
    condition = length(var.tags) &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; contains(["j-mark", "l-duke"], var.tags.contact) &amp;&amp; var.tags.env != null &amp;&amp; contains(["cart", "search", "cart:search"], var.tags.service)
    error_message = "Invalid resource tags applied."

  }
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now when you run <code>terraform plan</code> with a missing or invalid tag, you’ll get an error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre>Error: Invalid value for variable
...
Invalid resource tags applied.
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Your rules can be as complex as <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/index.html" target="_blank">Terraform’s Configuration Language</a> allows, so functions like <code>regex()</code>, <code>substr()</code>, and <code>distinct()</code> are all available. That said, there are some caveats to this approach.</p>

<p>First, custom variable validation is an experimental feature in Terraform. <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/terraform.html#experimental-language-features" target="_blank">Experimental features</a> are subject to change, meaning that you might need to pay attention to Terraform update mores closely. To enable <code>variable_validation</code>, add the following to your <code>terraform</code> block:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre>terraform {
  experiments = [variable_validation]
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Second, Terraform’s variable validation only happens during the <code>terraform plan</code> phase of your infrastructure’s lifecycle. It can’t prevent users from accidentally changing your tags directly in the AWS console, and it’s only as good as the validation rules you write. If you start using a new resource but forget to add validation rules, you might end up with lots of resources that don’t adhere to your tagging strategy.</p>

<p>Another option for paid Terraform Cloud customers is <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/sentinel/index.html" target="_blank">Sentinel</a>, which allows you to create custom policies for your resources. I won’t cover this method here, but Terraform has created an <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/sentinel/examples.html" target="_blank">example policy</a> to show you how to enforce mandatory AWS tags.</p>



<p>Similar to Terraform, AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" target="_blank">CloudFormation</a> lets you provision AWS resources based on configuration files. Unlike Terraform, CloudFormation is part of Amazon’s offerings, so it won’t necessarily help you if you want to use another infrastructure provider. The approach to tagging your resources in CloudFormation is similar to that used by Terraform, but as you’ll see, the configuration format is different.</p>

<p>If you’re new to AWS CloudFormation, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/GettingStarted.Walkthrough.html" target="_blank">Amazon’s official walkthrough</a> will help you get started deploying some basic templates. In this section, I’ll show you some snippets from a demo AWS CloudFormation template which is <a href="https://github.com/CloudForecast/cf-cloudformation-demo" target="_blank">also available on GitHub</a>. You’ll learn the following in this Terraform AWS tags section:</p>

<ol>
  <li>AWS CloudFormation Template to Deploy Tags</li>
  <li>Using CloudFormation to Update AWS Tags</li>
  <li>CloudFormation Template to Enforce AWS Tags</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="aws-cloudformation-template-to-deploy-tags">AWS CloudFormation Template to Deploy Tags</h3>

<p>AWS CloudFormation is designed to make it easy to create AWS resources with a single template file. Using a CloudFormation template, every resource that can be deployed with an AWS tag.</p>

<p>For example, to create a new EC2 instance with the same three AWS tags used in the Terraform example above, add an array of <code>Tags</code> to the resource’s <code>Properties</code> block:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8

14
15
16
17
18
19
20
21

23
24
</pre></td><td><pre>"Resources" : {
  "WebServerInstance": {  
    "Type": "AWS::EC2::Instance",
    "Metadata" : {...},
    "Properties": {
      "Tags" : [
       {
          "Key" : "contact",
          "Value" : "j-mark"
       },
       {
          "Key" : "env",
          "Value" : "dev"
       },
       {
          "Key" : "service",
          "Value" : "cart"
       }
      ],
      ...       
    }
  },
  ...         
},
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" target="_blank">AWS CLI</a>, you can <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudformation/create-stack.html" target="_blank">deploy this CloudFormation template as a new stack</a>. This will ensure your template is valid and create the specified resources with their tags on AWS:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>aws cloudformation create-stack --template-body file://path/to/your/template.json --stack-name=&lt;YOUR_STACK_NAME&gt;
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you have lots of similar resources in your template, you can deploy AWS tags to all the resources in the stack at once using the <code>--tags</code>  flag with the <code>create-stack</code> or <code>update-stack</code> commands:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre># Creating a stack with tags
aws cloudformation create-stack --template-body file://path/to/your/template.json --stack-name=&lt;YOUR_STACK_NAME&gt; --tags="Key=env,Value=dev"

# Updating a stack with tags
aws cloudformation update-stack --template-body file://path/to/your/template.json --stack-name=&lt;YOUR_STACK_NAME&gt; --tags="Key=env,Value=dev"
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="using-cloudformation-to-update-aws-tags">Using CloudFormation to Update AWS Tags</h3>

<p>If you want to change the contact on your EC2 instance created above, simply change the <code>Tags</code> section of your template file and use the <code>[update-stack](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudformation/update-stack.html)</code> <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudformation/update-stack.html" target="_blank">command</a> to deploy your changes.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
</pre></td><td><pre>"Tags" : [
 {
    "Key" : "contact",
    "Value" : "l-duke"
 },
  ...
],
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>AWS CloudFormation behaves the same way that Terraform does when you update tags outside your template file. Any tags set manually will be overridden by the <code>update-stack</code> …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I started investigating full-text search options recently. The use-case is real-time search over key-value pairs where the keys are strings and the values are either strings, numbers, or dates. It should enable full-text search over keys and values and range queries over numbers and dates with 1.5 million unique key-value pairs as the expected maximum search index size. The search company Algolia recommends an <a href="https://blog.algolia.com/algolia-v-elasticsearch-latency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">end-to-end latency budget</a> of no more than 50ms, so we’ll use that as our threshold.</p><h2 id="postgresql"><a href="#postgresql" jsx="[object Object]"></a>PostgreSQL</h2><p>I’m already familiar with PostgreSQL, so let’s see if it meets these requirements.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>When I was 15</strong>, one of my closest friends died unexpectedly. Our physics teacher broke the news to me after Iâ€™d sat an exam, having wondered all the way through why my friend wasnâ€™t there doing the same. I still donâ€™t have the words to describe how I felt: it was something approaching shock, distress, disorientation. I didnâ€™t know what to think, much less what to do. I spent many nights awake and many days in a daze.</p>
<p>Fifteen years later, when I was in graduate school, another friend died suddenly, a man I loved very much. I remember checking my phone and finding out, to my dismay, via text message. But while my initial response was much the same as before, there was a palpable difference in how I felt later on. While I was again surprised and saddened, I was much less disoriented than Iâ€™d been as a teenager. I could still think, and I could still get things done. It seemed to me that Iâ€™d become better at living with loss.</p>
<p>You might think that the reason for this difference is obvious â€“ I was older, and Iâ€™d had more experience in coping with death. But raw experience alone isnâ€™t enough: what matters more is whether we learn from experience. And learning from experience, especially an experience as difficult as the death of a loved one, can involve quite a lot. Among other things, it can involve creativity.</p>
<p>This claim might seem surprising. After all, creativity is often associated with the idea of a lone creative genius, an individual who not only excels at what they do, but also transforms the world in the process. Further, even if we donâ€™t limit ourselves to romantic or heroic perspectives on the nature and value of creativity, itâ€™s commonly thought that creativity at least aims at novelty or originality.</p>
<p>This way of thinking about creativity isnâ€™t universal. The <a href="http://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-complete-works-of-zhuangzi/9780231164740"><em>Zhuangzi</em></a> (èŽŠå­�), a classical Chinese philosophical and literary text, provides a different perspective. On one interpretation, creativity isnâ€™t conceived as aiming at novelty or originality, but rather <em>integration</em>. Instead of aiming at something new, it aims at something that combines well with the situation of which itâ€™s a part.</p>
<p>The story of Wheelwright Pian, from a chapter of the Zhuangzi known as the <em>Tian Dao</em> (å¤©é�“), meaning â€˜Heavenâ€™s Wayâ€™ or â€˜The Way of Heavenâ€™, effectively illustrates this perspective on creativity as it pertains to artists or artisans. In this short vignette, a wheelwright known as Pian (æ‰�) tells a duke that the book of sagesâ€™ advice heâ€™s reading is nothing but â€˜chaff and dregsâ€™. Angered, the duke demands an explanation. The wheelwright responds that, at least concerning his craft, he can create what he does only because heâ€™s developed a â€˜knackâ€™ for it that canâ€™t be wholly conveyed in words. If the blows of his mallet are too gentle, his chisel slides and wonâ€™t take hold. If theyâ€™re too hard, it bites in and wonâ€™t budge. â€˜Not too gentle, not too hard â€“ you can get it in your hand and feel it in your mind,â€™ he says. â€˜So, Iâ€™ve gone along for 70 years and at my age Iâ€™m still chiselling wheels. When the men of old died, they took with them the things that couldnâ€™t be handed down. So, what you are reading there must be nothing but the chaff and dregs of the men of old.â€™</p>
<p>Although heâ€™s a â€˜lowlyâ€™ craftsperson, the wheelwright has something important to teach the duke. Heâ€™s been creating wheels by hand for many years and has developed an ability to act and to execute his craft in an integrated manner that canâ€™t be fully captured through an algorithmic list of instructions. He responds to precise particularities in the wood, his tools and his body to create what he wants â€“ something he doesnâ€™t accomplish by imposing a plan.</p>
<p>Striving for originality can be counterproductive when it comes to achieving genuinely fresh results</p>
<p>The sagesâ€™ advice for living well is therefore mere â€˜dregsâ€™ if itâ€™s interpreted as instructions that one can simply read and then complete. Living well in general involves much more than this; namely, a spontaneous integration between contrasting types such as the hard and the soft, as well as the learned and the spontaneous, the active and the passive, and even the unproductive and the productive â€“ all of which apply in the case of carving wheels, as well as elsewhere. In other words, living well involves creativity.</p>
<p>This kind of creativity isnâ€™t taken to aim at novelty or originality as such. The wheelwright is presented as creative not because of anything to do with his, or his projectsâ€™, novelty or originality, but instead because of his ability to create wheels in a sensitive, responsive and â€“ crucially â€“ well-integrated manner: one not learned by rote, but rather via engaging in sustained, spontaneous activity.</p>
<p>We can use the story of Wheelwright Pian to better understand why learning to live with loss is a creative pursuit. Although thereâ€™s an abundance of books dispensing advice on how to do so, ultimately learning to live with death is a deeply personal endeavour that â€“ like carving wheels â€“ canâ€™t be fully captured through a programmatic set of directions. We must respond to precise particularities of our situation (concerning our thoughts, feelings and overall circumstances) to create what we want to create (such as a sense of peace or closure). This isnâ€™t something that can be accomplished by imposing a plan, even if we make various provisional and highly malleable â€˜plansâ€™ on the fly as we go along.</p>
<p>Moreover, in working through our thoughts, feelings and circumstances in all their particularities, itâ€™s not that weâ€™re doing anything all that different from what countless others have had to do as theyâ€™ve learned to cope with loss. Nonetheless â€“ again, like carving wheels â€“ itâ€™s plausibly a creative activity, in that it involves a spontaneous integration between contrasting types such as the grieving and the celebratory, the resentful and the grateful, the distressed and the joyous. The ability to live with death, too, in a sensitive, responsive, and well-integrated manner isnâ€™t learned by rote, but rather via engaging in sustained, spontaneous activity. Indeed, even the philosopher Zhuangzi himself can be understood as engaging in such a creative process after the death of his own wife in chapter 18 of the text, the <em>Zhi Le</em> (è‡³æ¨‚), meaning â€˜Perfect Happinessâ€™ or â€˜Perfect Joyâ€™.</p>
<p><strong>This way of thinking</strong> about creativity has a variety of other potential benefits. First, even if creativity were taken to aim at originality, de-emphasising originality might ironically result in greater creativity. This is because striving for originality can actually be counterproductive when it comes to achieving genuinely fresh results: if we focus on the task of achieving something original, weâ€™ll explore only the range of possibilities deemed sufficiently likely to yield that result, leaving out a lot that could have contributed to achieving something original.</p>
<p>But imagine instead that we worked with idea that creativity wasnâ€™t about novelty. That doesnâ€™t mean weâ€™d have to give up the value of originality entirely, but rather see it as one of a range of possible outcomes. Casting a wider net in this way might hence make creativity (whatever it involves) easier to achieve.</p>
<p>Second, focusing on integration could encourage us to better understand creative agents as being intimately connected with, and products of, their environments. This would broaden our notion of creativity in a way that might allow us to see creativity demanded in a greater range of activities. After all, many of lifeâ€™s activities, from the mundane to the meaningful, arenâ€™t learned by rote, but rather via spontaneous action that integrates contrasting aspects. Just for starters, additional examples might include getting along with oneâ€™s family, building relationships with colleagues and organising oneâ€™s finances.</p>
<p>This alternative perspective on creativity might help us to see it as an everyday phenomenon in which we all participate â€“ rather than an extraordinary talent or gift that only a few enjoy. And it might also allow us to make sense of the idea of <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-43893-1_19#:~:text=As%20an%20art%20practice%2C%20calligraphy,Daoist%20aesthetic%20concerns%20discussed%20here.&amp;text=The%20aesthetic%20of%20the%20everyday,and%20the%20need%20for%20imagination">living creatively</a>: of an integrated life, lived spontaneously, in which all of lifeâ€™s contrasting aspects can be arranged to form a rich and variegated whole.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<h2 id="about-the-course"> About the course</h2>
<p>This is an online course on Functional Programming that uses the Haskell programming language. You can study at your own pace. All the material and exercises are openly available.</p>
<p>This course is aimed at beginners who wish to learn functional programming, but also people who have experience with functional programming and want to learn Haskell in particular. The course assumes no previous knowledge, but knowing at least one programming language beforehand will make the course easier.</p>
<p>Working on the exercises involves knowing how to use the command line, and basic usage of the Git version control system.</p>
<p>This is part 1 of a two-part course. Part 1 covers the basics of Haskell syntax and features. You will learn about recursion, higher-order functions, algebraic data types and some of Haskell’s advanced features. However, part 1 will stick to pure functional programming, without side-effects. I/O and Monads will be introduced in part 2.</p>
<h3 id="course-structure"> Course structure</h3>
<p>The course is split into 8 lectures. They are roughly the same size, but some lectures have more material than others. Each lecture set ends with 10-30 small programming exercises on the topics of the lecture.</p>
<h3 id="administrative-information-grading"> Administrative information, grading</h3>
<p>The course is worth 5 ECTS credits.</p>
<p>Grading is Fail/Pass/5. To pass the course you must complete at least 50% of each lecture’s exercises. A special grade of 5 is awarded to those who complete 99% of all exercises.</p>

<h2 id="haskell"> Haskell</h2>
<p>Haskell is</p>
<p><strong>Functional</strong> – the basic building blocks of programs are functions. Functions can return functions and take functions as arguments. Also, the only looping construct in Haskell is recursion.</p>
<p><strong>Pure</strong> - Haskell functions are pure, that is, they don’t have side effects. Side effects mean things like reading a file, printing out text, or changing global variables. All inputs to a function must be in its arguments, and all outputs from a function in its return value. This sounds restricting, but makes reasoning about programs easier, and allows for more optimizations by the compiler.</p>
<p><strong>Lazy</strong> - values are only evaluated when they are needed. This makes it possible to work with infinite data structures, and also makes pure programs more efficient.</p>
<p><strong>Strongly typed</strong> - every Haskell value and expression has a type. The compiler checks the types at compile-time and guarantees that no type errors can happen at runtime. This means no AttributeErrors (a la Python), ClassCastExceptions (a la Java) or segmentation faults (a la C). The Haskell type system is very powerful and can help you design better programs.</p>
<p><strong>Type inferred</strong> - in addition to checking the types, the compiler can deduce the types for most programs. This makes working with a strongly typed language easier. Indeed, most Haskell functions can be written completely without types. However programmers can still give functions and values type annotations to make finding type errors easier. Type annotations also make reading programs easier.</p>
<p><strong>Garbage-collected</strong> - like most high-level languages these days, Haskell has automatic memory management via garbage collection. This means that the programmer doesn’t need to worry about allocating or freeing memory, the language runtime handles all of it automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Compiled</strong> - even though we mostly use Haskell via the interactive GHCi environment on this course, Haskell is a compiled language. Haskell programs can be compiled to very efficient binaries, and the GHC compiler is very good at optimising functional code into performant machine code.</p>
<p>You’ll learn what these terms mean in practice during this course. Don’t worry if some of them sound abstract right now.</p>

<h3 id="features"> Features</h3>
<p>Here’s a showcase of some of the Haskell’s cool features:</p>
<p><strong>Higher-order functions</strong> – functions can take functions as arguments:</p>

<p>This results in <code>[3,6]</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Anonymous functions aka lambdas</strong> – you can define single-use helper functions without giving them a name</p>

<p>This results in <code>["abc","ef"]</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Partial application</strong> – you can define new functions by giving another function only some of the arguments it needs. For example this multiplies all elements in a list by 3:</p>

<p><strong>Algebraic datatypes</strong> – a syntax for defining datatypes that can contain a number of different cases:</p>

<p>Now the type <code>Shape</code> can have values like <code>Point</code>, <code>Rectangle 3 6</code> and <code>Circle 5</code></p>
<p><strong>Pattern matching</strong> – defining functions based on cases that correspond to your data definitions:</p>

<p><strong>Lists</strong> – Unlike many languages, Haskell has a concise built-in syntax for lists. Lists can be built from other lists using <em>list comprehensions</em>. Here’s a snippet that generates names of even length from a set of options for first and last names:</p>

<p>This results in <code>["EvaSmith","EvaOdd","MikeWood"]</code>. Thanks to the laziness of Haskell, we can even create so-called <em>infinite lists</em>:</p>

<p>The first ten prime numbers can be then obtained by evaluating</p>

<p>This evaluates to <code>[2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29]</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Parameterized types</strong> – you can define types that are parameterized by other types. For example <code>[Int]</code> is a list of <code>Int</code>s and <code>[Bool]</code> is a list of booleans. You can define typed functions that work on all kinds of lists, for example <code>reverse</code> has the type <code>[a] -&gt; [a]</code> which means it takes a list containing any type <code>a</code>, and returns a list of the same type.</p>
<p><strong>Type classes</strong> – another form of polymorphism where you can give a function a different implementation depending on the arguments’ types. For example the <code>Show</code> type class defines the function <code>show</code> that can convert types of various values to strings. The <code>Num</code> type class defines arithmetic operators like <code>+</code> that work on all number types (<code>Int</code>, <code>Double</code>, <code>Complex</code>, …).</p>
<h3 id="some-history"> Some History</h3>
<p>A brief timeline of Haskell:</p>
<ul>
<li>1930s: Lamba Calculus</li>
<li>1950s-1970s: Lisp, Pattern Matching, Scheme, ML</li>
<li>1978 John Backus: <a href="https://www.thocp.net/biographies/papers/backus_turingaward_lecture.pdf">Can programming be liberated from the von Neumann style?</a></li>
<li>1987 A decision was made to unify the field of pure functional languages</li>
<li>1990 Haskell 1.0</li>
<li>1991 Haskell 1.1 (let-syntax, sections)</li>
<li>1992 Haskell 1.2, GHC</li>
<li>1996 Haskell 1.3 (Monads, do-syntax, type system improvements)</li>
<li>1999 Haskell 98</li>
<li>2000’s: GHC development, many extensions to the language</li>
<li>2009 <a href="http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/haskell2010/">The Haskell 2010 standard</a></li>
<li>2010’s: GHC development, Haskell Platform, Haskell Stack</li>
</ul>
<p>The word ‘haskel’ means wisdom in Hebrew, but the name of the Haskell programming language comes from the logician Haskell Curry. The name Haskell comes from the Old Norse words áss (god) and ketill (helmet).</p>
<h3 id="uses-of-haskell"> Uses of Haskell</h3>
<p>Here are some examples of software projects that were written in Haskell.</p>

<li>The <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> tool for converting between different document formats – it’s also used to produce this course material</li>
<li>The <a href="http://postgrest.org/">PostgREST</a> server that exposes a HTTP REST API for a PostgreSQL database</li>

<h2 id="running-haskell"> Running Haskell</h2>
<p>The easiest way to get Haskell is to install the <code>stack</code> tool, see <a href="http://haskellstack.org/">http://haskellstack.org</a>. The exercises on this course are intended to work with Stack, so you should use it for now.</p>
<p>By the way, if you’re interested in what Stack is, and how it relates to other Haskell tools like Cabal and GHC, <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Cabal-and-Stack-in-Haskell-projects-Which-one-do-you-recommend-and-why">read more here</a> or <a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/faq/">here</a>. We’ll get back to Haskell packages and using them in detail in part 2 of the course.</p>
<p>For now, after installing Stack, just run <code>stack ghci</code> to get an interactive Haskell environment.</p>
<h2 id="lets-start"> Let’s start!</h2>
<p>GHCi is the interactive Haskell interpreter. Here’s an example session:</p>
<pre><code>$ stack ghci
GHCi, version 8.0.1: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
Prelude&gt; 1+1
2
Prelude&gt; "asdf"
"asdf"
Prelude&gt; reverse "asdf"
"fdsa"
Prelude&gt; :type "asdf"
"asdf" :: [Char]
Prelude&gt; tail "asdf"
"sdf"
Prelude&gt; :type tail "asdf"
tail "asdf" :: [Char]
Prelude&gt; :type tail
tail :: [a] -&gt; [a]
Prelude&gt; :quit
Leaving GHCi.</code></pre>
<p>By the way, the first time you run <code>stack ghci</code> it will download GHC and some libraries, so don’t worry if you see some output and have to wait for a while before getting the <code>Prelude&gt;</code> prompt.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through this. Don’t worry if you don’t understand things yet, this is just a first brush with expressions and types.</p>
<pre><code>Prelude&gt; 1+1
2</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Prelude&gt;</code> is the GHCi prompt. It indicates we can use the functions from the Haskell base library called Prelude. We evaluate 1 plus 1, and the result is 2.</p>
<pre><code>Prelude&gt; "asdf"
"asdf"</code></pre>
<p>Here we evaluate a string literal, and the result is the same string.</p>
<pre><code>Prelude&gt; reverse "asdf"
"fdsa"</code></pre>
<p>Here we compute the reverse of a string by applying the function <code>reverse</code> to the value <code>"asdf"</code>.</p>
<pre><code>Prelude&gt; :type "asdf"
"asdf" :: [Char]</code></pre>
<p>In addition to evaluating expressions we can also ask for their type with the <code>:type</code> (abbreviated <code>:t</code>) GHCi command. The type of <code>"asdf"</code> is a list of characters. Commands that start with <code>:</code> are part of the user interface of GHCi, not part of the Haskell language.</p>
<pre><code>Prelude&gt; tail "asdf"
"sdf"
Prelude&gt; :t tail "asdf"
tail "asdf" :: [Char]</code></pre>
<p>The <code>tail</code> function works on lists and returns all except the first element of the list. Here we see <code>tail</code> applied to <code>"asdf"</code>. We also check the type of the …</p></div></div></div>

September 2, 2020 | https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/GoConcurrencyStillNotEasy | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/GoConcurrencyStillNotEasy">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Even in Go, concurrency is still not easy (with an example)</h2>

	<p><small>September  1, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Go is famous for making concurrency easy, through good language
support for <a href="https://golangbot.com/goroutines/">goroutines</a>. Except
what Go makes easy is only one level of concurrency, the nuts and
bolts level of making your code do things concurrently and communicating
back and forth through channels. Making it do the right things
concurrently is still up to you, and unfortunately Go doesn't
currently provide a lot of standard library support for correctly
implemented standard concurrency patterns.</p>

<p>For example, one common need is for a limited amount of concurrency;
you want to do several things at once, but only so many of them.
At the moment this is up to you to implement on top of goroutines,
channels, and things like the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/sync/"><code>sync</code></a>
package. This is not as easy as it looks, and quite competent people
can make mistakes here. As it happens, I have an example ready to
hand today.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/google/gops">Gops</a> is a convenient command to
list (and diagnose) Go processes that are currently running on your
system. Among other things, it'll tell you which version of Go they
were compiled with, which is handy if you want to see if you have out
of date binaries that should be rebuilt and redeployed. One of the
things <code>gops</code> needs to do is look at all of the Go processes on your
system, which it does concurrently. However, it doesn't want to look
at too many processes at once, because <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/pull/118">that can cause problems with
file descriptor limits</a>. This
is a classic case of <em>limited concurrency</em>.</p>

<p>Gops implements this at the moment with code in <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/blob/6fb0d860e5fa50629405d9e77e255cd32795967e/goprocess/gp.go#L29">goprocess.FindAll()</a>
that looks like this, in somewhat sketched and reduced form:</p>

<blockquote><pre>func FindAll() []P {
   pss, err := ps.Processes()
   [...]
   found := make(chan P)
   limitCh := make(chan struct{}, concurrencyProcesses)

   for _, pr := range pss {
      limitCh &lt;- struct{}{}
      pr := pr
      go func() {
         defer func() { &lt;-limitCh }()
         [... get a P with some error checking ...]
         found &lt;- P
      }()
   }
   [...]

   var results []P
   for p := range found {
      results = append(results, p)
   }
   return results
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>(In the real code there's a WaitGroup for coordination, and the
<code>found</code> channel gets closed appropriately.)</p>

<p>How this works is clear, and is a standard pattern (covered in eg
Go 101's <a href="https://go101.org/article/channel-use-cases.html">Channel Use Cases</a>). We use a
buffered channel to provide a limited number of tokens; sending a
value into the channel implicitly takes a token (and blocks if the
token supply is exhausted), while receiving a value from it puts a
token back in. We take a token before we start a new goroutine, and
the goroutine releases the token when it's done.</p>

<p>Except that <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/issues/123">this code has a bug if there are too many processes
to examine</a>. Even knowing
that there is a bug in this code, it may not be obvious.</p>

<p>The bug is that the goroutines only receive from <code>limitCh</code> to release
their token after sending their result to the unbuffered <code>found</code>
channel, while the main code only starts receiving from <code>found</code>
after running through the entire loop, and <strong>the main code takes
the token in the loop and blocks if no tokens are available</strong>. So
if you have too many processes to go through, you start N goroutines,
they all block trying to write to <code>found</code> and don't receive from
<code>limitCh</code>, and the main <code>for</code> loop blocks trying to send to <code>limitCh</code>
and never reaches the point where it starts receiving from <code>found</code>.</p>

<p>At one level, this bug is a very fragile bug; it only exists because
of multiple circumstances. If the goroutines took the token by
sending to <code>limitCh</code> instead of the main <code>for</code> loop doing it, the
bug would not exist; the main <code>for</code> loop would start them all, many
would stop, and then it would go on to receive from <code>found</code> so that
they could receive from <code>limitCh</code> and release their token so other
goroutines would run. If the goroutines received from <code>limitCh</code> to
release their token before sending to <code>found</code>, it wouldn't exist
(but because of error handling, it's simpler and more reliable to
do the receive in a <code>defer</code>). And if the entire <code>for</code> loop was in
an additional goroutine, the main code would go on to receive from
<code>found</code> and unblock completed goroutines to release their tokens,
so the fact that the <code>for</code> loop was blocked waiting to send to
<code>limitCh</code> wouldn't matter.</p>

<p>At another level, this shows how concurrency is not easy as easy
as it looks in Go. All you need is one mistake and things skid to
a halt, and all of the code involved can look good to a casual
examination. Getting concurrency correct is simply hard for people
(we can debate about why, but I think that it is is very clear).</p>

<p>(I'm sure that the people who wrote and approved the change that
added this concurrency limiting code to gops were good programmers.
A tricky case still tripped them up, passing all of their scrutiny.
Even when I knew that there was a concurrency problem in the code
and where it was (because my <code>gops</code> was hanging all of a sudden,
and <a href="https://github.com/go-delve/delve">Delve</a> told me where
everything was stuck), it still took me some time to see what the
exact problem was.)</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>To build your own you'll need</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> (model Zero W works pretty good)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera/">Raspberry Pi Camera Module</a></li>
<li>16GB SD Card or bigger</li>
<li>(optionally Wi-Fi connectivity for easy access)</li>
</ul>
<p>There is even an official <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera/">High Quality Camera</a>, that will give even better quality time-lapses!</p>

</ul></li>
<li><a href="#raspberry-pi-time-lapse-repository">raspberry-pi-time-lapse repository</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Preparation</h2>
<h3>Flash the Pi</h3>
<p>You'll need to flash Raspberry Pi OS on a fresh SD Card.</p>
<p>Either with <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/">Balena Etcher</a> or the official <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/">Raspberry Pi Imager</a>. The procedure is extremely straight forward.</p>
<p>Just go through the steps and you have Rasperry Pi OS installed on a SD card.</p>
<h3>Set up Wi-Fi connectivity</h3>
<p>To get the Pi connect to your Wi-Fi, you'll need to create a file called <code>wpa_supplicant.conf</code> in the SD card.</p>
<p>The contents of <code>wpa_supplicant.conf</code> should look like this (configure it accordingly):</p>
<pre><code>ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
ap_scan=1
update_config=1

network={
  scan_ssid=1
  ssid="YOUR_WIFI_ACCESS_POINT"
  psk="YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD"
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Enable SSH access</h3>
<p>To enable SSH access (with the user <code>pi</code> and password <code>raspberry</code>), simply create an empty file (without extension), called <code>ssh</code> in the SD card.</p>
<h3>Enable Camera module</h3>
<p>To enable to camera module, you can configure it through the <code>raspi-config</code> utility.</p>
<p>But also with the file <code>config.txt</code> in SD card.</p>
<p>Open it and add the following to it:</p>
<pre><code>start_x=1
gpu_mem=128
</code></pre>
<p>Just make sure there are no other occurrencies for <code>start_x</code> or <code>gpu_mem</code></p>

<h2>Take image with raspistill</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><code>raspistill</code> is the command line tool for capturing still photographs with the camera module.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea is to take a snapshot every x minutes using <code>raspistill</code></p>
<p>To take a single image, I'm using the following bash script called <code>/home/pi/take-snapshot</code>:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

set -e

DATE=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
SNAPSHOTS_DIR=/home/pi/snapshots
SNAPSHOT_PATH="$SNAPSHOTS_DIR/$DATE.jpg"
CURRENT_PATH="$SNAPSHOTS_DIR/current.jpg"

echo "$DATE"
mkdir -p "$SNAPSHOTS_DIR"
echo "taking snapshot $SNAPSHOT_PATH"
raspistill \
    --width 1280 \
    --height 960 \
    --quality 100 \
    --output "$SNAPSHOT_PATH"
echo "snapshot saved $SNAPSHOT_PATH"

echo "adding watermark $SNAPSHOT_PATH"
cd $SNAPSHOTS_DIR
montage \
  -label "$DATE" \
  $SNAPSHOT_PATH \
  -pointsize 30 \
  -gravity Center \
  -geometry +0+0 \
  $SNAPSHOT_PATH

cp $SNAPSHOT_PATH $CURRENT_PATH
</code></pre>
<p>This script will take a snapshot, name it in the format <code>%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ.jpg</code> and put it in the folder <code>/home/pi/snapshots</code>.</p>
<p>At the end this photo is also watermarked using <code>montage</code> from the ImageMagick family.</p>
<h2>Schedule capture with crontab</h2>
<p>To take a photo every 5 minutes using the above script, you can set up a simple cron job for that.</p>
<p>Just run <code>crontab -e</code> to edit the cron schedules and add the following lines</p>
<pre><code>SHELL=/bin/bash
*/5 * * * * sh /home/pi/take-snapshot &gt;&gt; /home/pi/snapshots.log 2&gt;&amp;1
</code></pre>
<h2>Directory listing of snapshots</h2>
<p>You can expose a web server on port 80 to easily list all images (and time-lapses) taken in the folder <code>/home/pi/snapshots</code>.</p>
<p>Start the server at boot by adding the following to your crontab</p>
<pre><code>@reboot sudo python3 -m http.server --directory /home/pi/snapshots 80
</code></pre>
<h2>Create time-lapse with ffmpeg</h2>
<p>Taking a time-lapse for the day <code>2020-08-31</code> with ffmpeg is as easy as running</p>
<pre><code>cat 2020-08-31*.jpg | ffmpeg -r 10 -i - -c:v libx264 -vf "format=yuv420p,scale=1280:-2" time-lapse-2020-08-31.mp4
</code></pre>

<p>You can clone / fork the repo <a href="https://github.com/christian-fei/raspberry-pi-time-lapse">christian-fei/raspberry-pi-time-lapse</a> and create your first time-lapse in no time.</p>
<p>There are various scripts that simplify the steps above:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>take-snapshot</code> to take a watermarked and timestamped photo in the folder <code>snapshots/</code></li>
<li><code>server</code> to start a HTTP server on port 80 listing all snapshots and time-lapses taken so far</li>
<li><code>rsync-snapshots</code> to sync the snapshots to from the Raspberry Pi to your PC</li>
<li><code>create-time-lapse</code> to create a time-lapse for a specific date</li>
<li><code>crontab</code> to schedule the snapshots and spin up the server</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Something my colleagues know well is how little I trust online tools like <a href="https://jwt.io/">jwt.io</a>, online JSON validators or online tooling in general, but it also bleeds into <a href="https://www.jvt.me/mf2/2020/08/zebqf/">comments I make online</a> and in my blog posts, too, and I thought I'd share a little bit of a reason as to why.</p><p>Instead of using an online service, I will reach for a way to run it locally, using whichever programming language toolchain I have available. But why? Why wouldn't I recommend something like jwt.io? Or an online JSON validator, especially if they boast client-side functionality, and mean I don't need things installed?</p><p>Let's start with a bit of background. Firstly, I'd just like to caveat this all with the note that <strong>I have no access to Production data, customer or otherwise</strong>. All of these examples are referencing Non-Production examples.</p><p>I also want to caveat this with the fact that this is <strong>not a personal attack</strong> on jwt.io. I am using them as an example as they're a well-known and well-used service, and I've seen issues with it before. Auth0 run it, and are probably one of the few companies we'd want to be running it. It's also <a href="https://github.com/jsonwebtoken/jsonwebtoken.github.io">Open Source</a> <em>but</em> one of the great difficulties of Web-hosted services are that we have no idea if the source code that we're told is being used is actually being used!</p><p>I'm currently working on the Open Banking platform for Capital One. We're fortunate to have very restricted access to Production, which makes things safer for everyone. One thing we strive to do is to treat Non-Production secrets like Production ones where possible - where we shouldn't have access to them at all, and shouldn't be sharing them with external services. Some of these Non-Production secrets may be usable outside of Capital One, for instance Open Banking Sandbox signing certificates.</p><p>We perform a fair bit of testing in our Non-Production environments and sometimes need to debug things, such as what's inside a JWT (as Open Banking introduces several places they're used). I've been burned a number of times by folks putting a Non-Production JWT or an Open Banking Sandbox certificate into jwt.io. Although Non-Production, these are sensitive in of themselves, as they have implementation details for our services, and as mentioned, certain things could be used outside of Capital One.</p><p>The biggest reason I hear from folks using online tooling is that it's easier, and that they'd rather do that than find out how to run it locally. I disagree with this, but am quite biased, as I often have a blog post for many of these common issues. I love sharing my blog with others and having a handy solution, or if I don't have an answer to a problem, I'll find out how and <a href="https://www.jvt.me/tags/blogumentation/">blogument it for later</a>. So I see that reaching for online tooling is more just because we've got folks who aren't aware of how they could do otherwise.</p><p>One great thing about removing the need for an online tool is that you can self-serve it once you have the tools locally. You can run it locally when you've got no internet (which isn't as much of an issue in these Coronavirus times) but also regardless of whether the upstream service is broken. You can use it with other i.e. command-line tooling, for instance how I've set up <a href="https://gitlab.com/jamietanna/dotfiles-arch/-/blob/master/terminal/home/bin/unpack">this command-line script</a> to handle a lot of common data formats I deal with and unpack them to a human-readable format.</p><p>But most importantly, by telling people to put sensitive data (such as credentials, configuration files, etc) it's a really dangerous lesson for our teams. We're teaching people to blindly trust arbitrary websites that they don't have any relationship with, nor have fully audited the source code, when posting potentially sensitive data.</p><p>I realise this may not be something you do when running it locally, but it's less likely for a well-known library running locally to need to reach outbound.</p><p>jwt.io is an interesting example, because although it boasts that it runs as a client-side solution, you may not have been aware that <a href="https://github.com/jsonwebtoken/jsonwebtoken.github.io/commit/b362ab19a9f37e337b5f8ea38987aa680aa6e0a9">until last September</a>, there were metrics being determined which although may have seemed innocent, show that it's easy for other functionality to be hidden in a seemingly client-side-only website. Unless you audit everything, every time, you're in a risky position where you may be leaking data you're not expecting to.</p><p>I feel that we can do something to help services that handle potentially sensitive data with helping educate the user that they should be more careful, because jwt.io's warning definitely doesn't help with folks who don't fully appreciate what the risk is if jwt.io isn't actually as trustworthy as the user thinks:</p><blockquote><p>Warning: JWTs are credentials, which can grant access to resources. Be careful where you paste them! We do not record tokens, all validation and debugging is done on the client side.</p></blockquote><p>What do you think? Am I maybe being a little too sensitive? Am I not being sensitive enough?</p><p>Edit: Based on some conversations being had in response to the post, I thought it'd mention I've written about how to <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/06/13/pretty-printing-jwt-openssl/">pretty-print a JWT locally with OpenSSL</a> and <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2018/08/31/pretty-printing-jwt-ruby/">a Ruby alternative</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>In the early 70s, C was created at Bell Labs as a byproduct of the development of UNIX.
It quickly became one of the most popular programming languages.
But it was not expressive enough for Bjarne Stroustrup.
And so, in 1983, as a byproduct of his Ph.D. thesis, he extended C.</p>
<p>C with classes was born.</p>
<p>At the time, Bjarne Stroustrup understood that a programming language has many components,
not only the language, its compiler, but also a linker and libraries.
Offering a familiar tool also makes adoption easier.
In this historical context, it makes sense that C++ would be based on C.</p>
<p>Fast-forward 40 years later.</p>
<p>Both C and C++ are widely used in the industry.
But go 5 minutes on the Internet and C developers will tell you that C++ is the most horrific man-made creation,
while many C++ developers wait for the day when C finally burns in the hot flames of hell.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-happened">So what happened?</h2>
<p>On the surface, C and C++ cater to the same use cases: high performance, deterministic, native but portable code for the widest range of hardware and applications.</p>
<p>But C is proudly a low-level language. A nicer assembly.</p>
<p>From day one, C++ had magic. Dark witchcraft: destructors. Suddenly the compiler was doing things on its own.
It also had type inference very early on, but the developers of the mid-80s were not quite ready for that and Bjarne Stroustrup
was pressured into removing <code>auto</code>, until it was added back to C++11.</p>
<p>From then, C++ got more and more tools to build abstractions.
I don’t think it would be fair to say that C++ is a low-level or high-level language. It’s both, by design.
But building high-level abstractions while not sacrificing performance is hard.
C++ then needed tools to achieve that: <code>constexpr</code>, move semantics, templates, and an ever-growing standard library.</p>
<p>Fundamentally I think C trusts developers while C++ trusts compilers.
This is a massive difference that sharing the same native types or syntax for while loop cannot hide.</p>
<p>C++ developers blame C for all their lost limbs, while C developers probably think C++ is batshit crazy.
I imagine that is a fair perspective if you look at C++ through a C lense. C++ is pretty wild <em>as a superset of C</em>.
A seasoned C person looking at C++ expecting familiarity in C++ will not find it. C++ is not C.
This is enough to feed flamewars for generations.</p>
<p>But as much as I dislike C, I don’t have any legitimacy to make fun of it. See, I have some experience with C++ but I
wrote very little C. It was probably bad C.
A language is also its good practices, patterns, idioms, and these take years to learn. If you try to write C code like it’s C++ or C++ like it is C, you will have a bad time.
Knowing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnWhqhNdYyk">C doesn’t teach you C++</a>. Knowing C++ does not teach you C.</p>
<p>So can we all stop saying C/C++, regret the unfortunate naming, and sing kumbaya in harmony?
Not so fast.</p>
<p>See, despite being philosophically different from C, C++ is still somewhat a superset of C.
That is to say, you can include a C header in a C++ translation unit and that should compile.
And this is where it gets messy.</p>
<p>C++ is not an extension of C.
It is designed as a separate standard, by a different committee, different people.
Logically, people who like C++'s philosophy will get involved in the C++ community and the C++ standardization process
while other people might try to get involved with C.
Committees, whether its C’s or C++'s, only manifest intent and direction through their respective end-product: the standards; standards which are the fruits of numerous voting.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is difficult for a compiler to know that it is dealing with a C header or a C++ header.</p>
<p><code>extern "C"</code> is not used consistently and only affects mangling, but neither grammar nor semantics.
And headers only exists in the eyes of the preprocessor, for a C++ compiler, everything is a C++ translation unit, and therefore C++.
And yet, people include C headers in C++ and expect it to “just work” ™️.
Which it mostly does.</p>
<p>We can wonder then,</p>
<h2 id="how-c-maintains-c-compatibility-while-being-developed-by-different-people-in-different-places">How C++ maintains C compatibility while being developed by different people in different places?</h2>
<p>Badly, I’m afraid.</p>
<p>A coworker recently reminded me of Conway’s law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By that logic, it would stand to reason that if the two committees don’t interoperate,
neither would the languages they produce.</p>
<p>C++ maintains a list of <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/diff.iso">incompatibilities with C</a> and <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/diff.library">its standard library</a>.
This list does not seem to reflect the many features that were added to C11 and C18 but are not valid C++ constructs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibility_of_C_and_C%2B%2B">Wikipedia</a> draws a clearer picture.</p>
<p>Listing incompatibilities isn’t sufficient to get a measure of incompatibilities between both languages.</p>
<p>Functions that exist in the C++ standard library but whose primary declaration is expected to come from C are difficult to make <code>constexpr</code>, and more difficult still to make <code>noexcept</code>.
C compatibility translates to performance costs and C functions are optimization barriers.</p>
<p>Many C constructs are valid C++ but should never pass a code review (<code>NULL</code>, <code>longjmp</code>, <code>malloc</code>, create/destroy functions, <code>free</code>, C  casts), etc.</p>
<p>These might not be bad C idioms, but they are bad C++. C++ has a stronger type system,
and unfortunately using C idioms punch a giant hole in that type system, and so C compatibility has a cost in terms of safety.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, C++ still care about C compatibility. Somewhat.
And interestingly C cares about C++. Somewhat.
Truth be told, C might care about C++ more than C++ cares about C.
So each committee cares somewhat about what the other does.
We care reluctantly.</p>
<p>See, C++ is aware of the many foundational libraries written in C, not only the <code>libc</code> but also <code>zip</code>, <code>png</code>, <code>curl</code>, <code>openssl</code> (!), and countless others, which are used in many, many C++ projects.
We can’t break that.</p>
<p>But recently, especially over the past decade, C++ has become much bigger than C.
C++ has more users - and a much more active community: <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2018/11/21/">There Are No C Conferences</a>.
Maybe that’s why the C++ committee is now over 10 times the size of the C committee.</p>
<p>C++ then is a force to be reckoned with and the C committee has to consider not breaking C++.
To the point that if a standard would track another, these days, C++ leads and C follow.</p>
<p>C++ is now on a steady three years cycle come rain or shine, or deadly pandemics.
Meanwhile, C has a major release every decade or so.
This makes sense. As a lower-level language, C doesn’t need to evolve as fast.</p>
<p>The C landscape is also rather different from the C++ landscape.
C caters to more platforms and a lot more compilers.
Everybody and their dog is writing C compilers because the language has a surface area small enough to make that possible, whereas the C++ committee will only really consider 4 implementations, all of which are represented at every meeting.
As a result, many features in C are implementation-defined or optionally supported so that the variety of compilers that exist can claim conformance without doing much work, which I’m told pleases regulatory bodies.</p>
<p>C++ these days is more interested in portability than implementation freedom. Yet another difference of philosophy.</p>
<h2 id="so-your-proposal-breaks-c-compatibility">So, your proposal breaks C compatibility</h2>
<p>Parts of my <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2178r1.pdf">P2178</a> paper theoretically affects C compatibility.
In such cases, none of the options seems satisfactory.</p>
<p>You could be told that you have to first get your feature into C. Which means more meetings.
Meetings you might not be able to attend because C has strict <a href="https://thephd.github.io/follow-the-river-wg14-ithaca-2019">attendance rules</a> - Excluding individuals not willing to put down thousands of dollars to become ISO members.
This is because the C committee is forced to adhere strictly to ISO rules.</p>
<p>It might also take a decade if the standard just shipped.
And most importantly, it might go nowhere if the C committee doesn’t understand or doesn’t care about the particular problem you are trying to solve.
And they probably don’t have the bandwidth to deal with it.
And you may not have the bandwidth to deal with C. After all, you joined C++ to improve C++.
In fact, if the room invites you to “talk to the C committee”, it is likely your proposal is dead, even in the unlikely event that no one in the room was against it.</p>
<p>Another likely scenario is that the C committee accepts a version of a proposal that is slightly different from what exists in C++.
<code>true</code>? Let’s make that a macro. <code>char16_t</code> ? Let’s make that a typedef. <code>char32_t</code>? Not necessarily UTF-32. <code>static_assert</code> ? <code>_Static_assert</code>.</p>
<p>The list goes on. Should we blame C? Probably not. Their committee does what they think is best for their language.
The opposite is true too. In C++20 designated initializers were inspired by C’s but are slightly different because they would otherwise not fit with the C++ initialization rules.</p>
<p>I am part of the problem. C has VLAs. I would vote against a proposal to adopt that in standard C++, <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Linux-Kills-The-VLA">too many security issues</a>. A proposal to add <code>_Generic</code> to C++ would be over-my-dead-body. I am not sure if <code>_Generic</code> attempts to palliate to the lack of template or the lack of overloads, but C++ has both these features - from my point of view <code>_Generic</code> doesn’t fit into the big picture of what I imagine C++ to be.</p>
<p>Both committees seem also inconsistent in how much they care about the other language.
Sometimes we go to great lenghts (<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/complex">std::complex</a>), sometimes we don’t care at all (<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/array">static array parameters</a>).</p>
<p>There is no way around this. Don’t forget that each committee is a bunch of people
voting at different times in different rooms and trying to control the outcome would defeat the purpose
of having a vote.
Putting people in the same room is not realistic either. ISO might object and the participation inbalance
would put C people at an enormous disadvantage.</p>
<h2 id="c-compatibility-doesnt-matter-kinda">C compatibility doesn’t matter, kinda</h2>
<p>If you are a C developer, I imagine you see C as a neat programming language.
But for the rest of us, C is something else.</p>
<p>C is the universal, cross-language glue that ties it all together.</p>
<p>For C++ users, C is …</p></div></div>

September 2, 2020 | https://www.causal.app/blog/cac-is-not-sales-marketing-expense | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.causal.app/blog/cac-is-not-sales-marketing-expense">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Note:&nbsp;this was originally published at </em><a href="https://alexoppenheimer.substack.com/" target="_blank"><em>https://alexoppenheimer.substack.com/</em></a></p><p>Generally accepted accounting principles were designed to create a single standard for comparing any and all businesses using the same terms and metrics. This is a very powerful tool, but it is a clear exchange for breadth over specificity. As a result, the economic reality of a business will likely differ from what the accounting metrics represent. By looking at a subset of business models, we can improve specificity - terms like <em>ARR </em>and <em>GMV</em> are both examples of this. While these terms have their own challenges with definitions, I think most agree what they represent: ARR is annualized recurring revenue for SaaS companies, and GMV is gross merchandise/marketplace value for marketplace companies.</p><p>One of my favorite examples of this is CAC - customer acquisition cost. It’s relevant for both SaaS businesses and marketplaces. Average CAC is the cost to acquire a single customer and Total CAC is the full spend for a cohort of customers. So what is the difference between <strong>CAC</strong> and <strong>Sales &amp; Marketing</strong> expense? The truth is that Total CAC and S&amp;M over a given period of time <em>might </em>be the same. That being said, the usually differ by a <em>time offset </em>that depends on <strong><em>sales cycle length</em></strong>.</p><p>The critical distinction is <strong>sales cycle length</strong>. <em>Sales cycle is how long it takes for a customer to go from first contact to closing a deal</em>. We measure sales cycle by segment and can use simple reports in Salesforce or another CRM tool to figure out how long it takes on average for customers to move through the sales funnel. Generally sales opportunities begin as leads, some of those convert to <em>qualified for sales</em> and then some of those convert to <em>closed-won</em>. The Sales Funnel shows the volume and conversion at each step in the process and is usually in the hands of the CRO or sales operations team. The two lengths of time that we care about in finance are: top of funnel to sales qualification (i.e. marketing cycle length) and then sales qualification to closed-won (i.e. sales cycle length).</p><p>There is a large variance in sales cycle lengths from business to business. For example, consumer software might have a &lt;1 month sales cycle that runs entirely on marketing. On the other end of the spectrum, a complex sale to a large institution may take over a year and involve a number of different people and teams.</p><p>For the in-month sales cycle, New ARR in Month X will be attributed to the Marketing expense in Month X. Pretty straightforward.</p><p>As soon as you have a separate marketing funnel and sales funnel and things take longer than a few weeks, it becomes more complicated to measure, track and predict.</p><p>I often see operating stats that look like this:</p><figure id="w-node-be6f6b2d374d-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5f4e9f755f630ab3e0e98ebd_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252F79d18d99-150c-4eae-b10a-cc00916f9da3_1168x196.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>The high level sales efficiency metric is New ARR / S&amp;M: the idea being that we are investing in S&amp;M in order to generate new ARR. The missing piece of information here is <strong>how long are the customers in the marketing funnel and how long are they in the sales funnel</strong>. Without that info, people often assume that it is in the same time period - whether that is a month, a quarter or a year. Switching over to a CAC calculation based on sales cycle length gives a more accurate picture of the sales efficiency.<br></p><p>For example: let’s say the marketing funnel takes <strong>1 month</strong> and the sales funnel takes <strong>3 months</strong>.<br></p><p>As a result, CAC would be the Marketing expense from 3 months prior and the average of the Sales expense over the last 3 months. So in the above example, new ARR acquired in April would be associated with the Marketing spend in January and the average of the Sales spend in Feb, March and April. Because this is a growing business, CAC will be lower than the S&amp;M in the same month, meaning that efficiency numbers are actually higher when based on CAC. Quick note to operating executives: don’t use a basic formula and sell yourself short.<br></p><p>Now looking at it through the lens of sales cycle-dependent CAC:<br></p><figure id="w-node-5b3f68252472-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5f4e9f8ca3a860067d1d36b8_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252Fce0d6249-9d70-4cff-87bb-36004dfe03c8_1168x278.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>Once you have the CAC line in the model, you can use it for SaaS Magic number, CAC payback, and a number of other metrics. (Of course, as the sales cycle changes, the CAC calculation must also change.) These metrics are important because they usually stay constant for a given product and business operation and allow you to project into the future.</p><p>The CAC calculation gets you one level deeper towards operating metrics from the high level financial metrics and is often a good bridge between the two. It represents the detailed funnels at a high level, and will ultimately drive projections with a higher degree of accuracy. For example, we now know that leads acquired through marketing spend in December will not yield sales until 3 months later in March. Based on historical metrics, we know roughly how many leads this spend will get us and therefore what kind of sales capacity we need to close on those leads and can plan sales hiring accordingly.<br></p><p>Coming from the financial perspective down into the operating perspective is a bit of a rabbit hole, so there’s an art in knowing where to stop, and it’s usually the point where precision starts to overtake accuracy in the model and digging deeper stops yielding better results. One step down from this, for example, would be to look into the sales expense - sales people are generally paid 50%+ of their total salary in commissions. If those commissions are paid in the month of sale, half of the sales expense should be weighted from that month and the other half weighted across the earlier months. If sales people are paid later on, then looking at it from a purely economic perspective as it pertains to commission rates will yield a much better result than looking at the accounting outputs for sales expense.<br></p></div></div>]]>

  <time datetime="2020-09-02T00:00:00+00:00">September 02, 2020</time>
</header>

  <p>Recently I came across a <a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/if-else-is-a-poor-mans-polymorphism-ab0b333b7265">blog post</a>
whose author claims, from the perspective of good coding practices, polymorphism is strictly superior to branching. 
In the post they make general statements about how branching statements lead to unreadable, unmaintainable, inflexible code and
how they are a sign of immaturity. However, in my opinion, the topic is much deeper and in this post 
I try to objectively discuss the reasons for and against branching.</p>

<!--more-->



<p>Before I dive into polymorphism vs branching dilemma, let’s first define what we mean when we say some code is
flexible and easy to extend. In my career I reviewed thousands of lines of code, and I had thousands of lines of my code
reviewed by others, and during these reviews it often occured that the terms <em>code extensibility</em> or <em>flexibility</em> 
mean different things to different people. Familiarity with the code-base or particular programming style plays a huge role.</p>

<p>For example, someone used to writing code in a Java/C# OOP style would generally consider dynamic polymorphism through 
interfaces a standard way of providing extensibility to the code, 
while a C programmer may find a switch or if/else much more 
approachable than OOP. There are also many other factors related 
to maintainability as quality of documentation, good naming, separation of concerns, etc. These factors are orthogonal 
to the “polymorphism vs branching” dimension and also far too broad for a single blog post, so I won’t discuss them.</p>

<p>For the sake of this post, let’s define <em>extensibility</em> as the inverse of number of distinct units in the codebase
that need to be changed in order to implement a new feature. The more places you have to touch to implement the feature, 
the harder the code is to change. Obviously, it is much better when you have to touch only
one unit of code (one function, one class, one module, one package) rather than change 10 distinct unrelated units.</p>


<p>Imagine you’re writing a calculator. Your program gets an expression as an input and outputs the computed value.
For example the user inputs <code>1 + 2 * 3</code> and the output is <code>7</code> 
(or <code>9</code> if you’ve messed up the operator precedence like one of my former CS students).</p>

<p>Why such a silly example? Who is writing calculators these days? Probably no-one, but this looks like a classic example given
in many programming classes. And it is easy enough to illustrate the concept.</p>

<p>How can we model a structure to represent an expression?
You’d probably use classes or structures. Here is the code in Scala:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span><span>)</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span> <span>=</span> <span>value</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>left</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>,</span> <span>right</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>)</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span> <span>=</span> <span>left</span><span>.</span><span>eval</span> <span>+</span> <span>right</span><span>.</span><span>eval</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then it is quite easy to build an expression and evaluate it:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>),</span> <span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)).</span><span>eval</span> <span>// evaluates to 5 </span>
</code></pre></div></div>


<p>This OOP-based solution is indeed very extensible when it comes to add a new operator.
The example above is missing subtraction operation. We can add one by defining a new class:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>Sub</span><span>(</span><span>left</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>,</span> <span>right</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>)</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span> <span>=</span> <span>left</span><span>.</span><span>eval</span> <span>-</span> <span>right</span><span>.</span><span>eval</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s really awesome – we didn’t have to touch any old code at all! 
OOP definitely rocks here.</p>


<p>Imagine you continued to extend our calculation engine with more operation classes over the next few years.
You’ve added multiplication, division, modulo, variables, logarithms, trigonometric functions, etc.</p>

<p>Then suddenly a new requirement comes – users want to not only evaluate the value of an expression,
but also do symbolic manipulation – e.g. simplify expressions. For example, given an expression
<code>a + a</code> they want to get an expression <code>2 * a</code> as a result.</p>

<p>This requirement can’t be captured by the <code>eval</code> method on the <code>Expression</code> interface. We need a new method:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>simplify</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And as the next step, they would likely want to be able to display the expression as a String:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>simplify</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>toString</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>How many units of code do you have to change now to implement these features?
<strong>All the implementations of <code>Expression</code></strong>. Before touching all the classes, the code wouldn’t even compile.
It looks like in the context of this kind of feature, our polymorphic solution is terribly non-extensible.</p>


<p>Let’s take a step back and let’s see how we could implement this differently.
Scala and many other modern languages have a feature called <em>pattern matching</em>
which can be considered a very flexible, powerful switch.</p>

<p>Instead of defining the operations like <code>eval</code> or <code>simplify</code> on the case classes,
let’s pull them up:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>

<p>Now adding a new operation like <code>Sub</code> would require two changes to the code – adding a new class
<em>and</em> adding a new case in the match (switch) statement.</p>

<p>Some may say this much worse not only because of more places to update, but because of a possibility of
forgetting to update the switches which could lead to runtime errors due to unhandled cases.
Fortunately, Scala designers thought about this by providing the <code>sealed</code> keyword, which instructs the compiler
that all case classes can be defined in the same module only. This unlocks pattern exhaustiveness analysis and the
compiler would warn about missing cases:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sealed</span> <span>trait</span> <span>Expression</span>
<span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span><span>)</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Expression</span>

  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What about adding new functions like <code>simplify</code> or <code>toString</code>? 
It requires to changle only <strong>one place</strong> – by adding the required methods. 
No changes to the existing code are needed!</p>

<p>The blog post I mentioned in the introduction stated that using polymorphism instead of
branching leads to more readable code. I find this statement far too general and actually very debatable.</p>

<p>First, even in their own example given by the author of that blog, the solution using branching was a lot
shorter and less complex than the solution using OOP. While brief code is not always more readable than a longer version of it,
in that case, I found branching to be very explicit and easy to follow. 
It is much easier to understand the control flow
in such a program because all targets are explicitly given in a single place. In the OOP solution, 
the actual implementations are hidden behind the interface and it is much harder to find them all without additional 
help of a good IDE with a “jump to implementations” feature 
(which fortunately often works well for statically typed languages, but I’ve seen IDEs sometimes 
struggle with dynamic languages like Python).</p>

<p>Second, in general case, branching has an advantage that the function logic may depend on more than
one object type or even the actual data. For example, in the example from this post, 
the transformation <code>a * (b + c)</code> =&gt; <code>a * b + a * c</code> would depend on 
both addition and multiplication. In the classic OOP solution, would you place it in the <code>Add</code> or in the <code>Mul</code> class? 
Neither seems right. Also, putting it into one of them creates a dependency on the other one. 
An expression simplifier with code scattered accross multiple classes heavily depending on each other 
would be hard to understand.</p>


<p>This is a blog on high performance programming, so the post would be incomplete without a 
section on performance. In theory, a sufficiently good compiler should produce the same
code regardless of the choice between branching or dynamic polymorphism, but is this the case in reality?
Compilers have limitations and often don’t generate the best result code possible.</p>

<p>Let’s consider a more realistic example this time.
Some time ago I was working on serializing/deserializing code in a database system.
I stumbled upon a set of classes that described data types. They all implemented 
a common interface defining methods for serializing and deserializing values of given data type
and also computing serialized data lenghts. The following Rust snippet is a huge simplification 
of that code, but it illustrates the concept:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>trait</span> <span>DataType</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>usize</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>IntType</span><span>;</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>DataType</span> <span>for</span> <span>BoolType</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>usize</span> <span>{</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>DataType</span> <span>for</span> <span>IntType</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>usize</span> <span>{</span> <span>4</span> <span>}</span>

<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>data_len</span><span>(</span><span>data_type</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>dyn</span> <span>DataType</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>usize</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>data_type</span><span>.len</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Given a reference to a <code>DataType</code> object, it is trivial to compute the data size associated with it, 
without knowing the exact static type:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>t1</span> <span>=</span> <span>IntType</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>t2</span> <span>=</span> <span>LongType</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>v</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>dyn</span> <span>DataType</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>vec!</span><span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>t1</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>t2</span><span>];</span>
<span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>data_len</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]));</span>  <span>// prints 4</span>
<span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>data_len</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]));</span>  <span>// prints 8</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="performance-of-dynamic-dispatch">Performance of Dynamic Dispatch</h2>

<p>The implementation of the <code>data_len</code> function is actually very simple:</p>


<p>Wow! A single assembly instruction! 
It jumps to the address stored in the the vtable of the object pointed by the <code>rsi</code> register.
The target of the jump depends on the actual type of the object. Here is the code generated for <code>IntType.len</code>:</p>



<p>The codes for the other types differ only in the constant value.</p>

<p>These are only 3 instructions to return the result. Shouldn’t it be fast? 
Let’s measure this. Let’s put more random <code>DataType</code> objects …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>At Buffer, we’ve been using <a href="https://kubernetes.io/case-studies/buffer/">Kubernetes since 2016</a>.  We’ve been managing our k8s (kubernetes) cluster with <a href="https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/">kops</a>, it has about 60 nodes (on AWS), and runs about 1500 containers. Our transition to a micro-service architecture has been full of trial and errors. Even after a few years running k8s, we are still learning its secrets. This post will talk about how something we thought was a good thing, but ended up to be not as great as we thought: <strong>CPU limits</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="cpu-limits-and-throttling">CPU limits and Throttling</h2>
<p>It is s general recommendation to set CPU limits. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/kubernetes-best-practices-resource-requests-and-limits">Google, among others, highly recommends it</a>. The danger of not setting a CPU limit is that containers running in the node could exhaust all CPU available. This can trigger a cascade of unwanted events such as having key Kubernetes processes (such as <code>kubelet</code>) to become unresponsive. So it is in theory a great thing to set CPU limit in order to protect your nodes.</p>
<p>CPU limits is the maximum CPU time a container can uses at a given period (100ms by default). The CPU usage for a container will never go above that limit you specified. Kubernetes use a mechanism called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completely_Fair_Scheduler">CFS Quota</a> to <strong>throttle</strong> the container to prevent the CPU usage from going above the limit. That means CPU will be artificially restricted, making the performance of your containers lower (and slower when it comes to latency).</p>
<h2 id="what-can-happen-if-we-dont-set-cpu-limits">What can happen if we don’t set CPU limits?</h2>
<p>We unfortunately experienced the issue. The <code>kubelet</code> , a process running on every node, and in charge of managing the containers (pods)  in the nodes became unresponsive. The node will turn into a <code>NotReady</code> state, and containers (pods) that were present will be rescheduled somewhere else, and create the issue in the new nodes. Definitely not ideal isn’t it?</p>
<h2 id="discovering-the-throttling-and-latency-issue">Discovering the throttling and latency issue</h2>
<p>A key metric to check when you are running container is the <code>throttling</code> . This indicate the number of time your container has been throttled. Interestingly, we’ve discovered a lot of containers having throttling no matter if the CPU usage was near the limits or not. Here the example of one of our main API:</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/cpu-usage-limits.png" alt="Kubernetes pods CPU usage and limits"></p>
<p>You can see in the animation that the CPU limits is set at <code>800m</code> (0.8 core, 80% of a core), and the peak usage is at most <code>200m</code> (20% of a core). After seeing, we might think we have plenty of CPU to let the service running before it throttle right? . Now check this one out:</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/cpu-throttling-low-usage.gif" alt="Kubernetes pods Low CPU usage, High limit, lot of throttling"></p>
<p>You can notice the CPU throttling occurs, even though the CPU usage is below the CPU Limits. The maximum CPU usage isn’t even near the CPU limits.</p>
<p>We’ve then found a few resources(<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/67577">github issue</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpFApeaGv7A&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1204">zanado talk</a>,  <a href="https://medium.com/omio-engineering/cpu-limits-and-aggressive-throttling-in-kubernetes-c5b20bd8a718">omio post</a>) talking about how throttling lead to poorer performances and latency for your services.</p>
<p><strong>Why do we see CPU throttling while CPU usage is low?</strong>
The tldr is basically a bug in the Linux kernel throttling unecessarly containers with CPU limit. If you’re curious about the nature of it, I invite you to check Dave Chiluk’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE7QX98-kO0">great talk</a>, a <a href="https://engineering.indeedblog.com/blog/2019/12/unthrottled-fixing-cpu-limits-in-the-cloud/">written version</a> also exists with more details.</p>

<p>After many long discussions, we’ve decided to remove the CPU limits for all services that were directly or indirectly on the critical path of our users.</p>
<p>This wasn’t an easy decision since we value the stability of our cluster. We’ve experimented in the past some instability in our cluster with services using too much resources and disrupting all other services present in the same node.  That time was a bit different, we understood more about how our services needed to be and had a good strategy to roll this out.</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/unleash-k8s.jpg" alt="Buffer-remove-cpu-limits-announcement"></p>
<h2 id="how-to-keep-your-nodes-safe-when-removing-limits-">How to keep your nodes safe when removing limits ?</h2>
<p><strong>Isolating “No CPU Limits” services:</strong></p>
<p>In the past we’ve seen some nodes going to a <code>notReady</code> state, mainly because some services were using too much resources in a node.</p>
<p>We’ve decided to put those services on some specific nodes (tainted nodes), so those services will not disrupt all the “bounded” ones.  We have better control and could identify easier if any issue occurs with a node. We did this by tainting some nodes and adding toleration to services that were “unbounded”. Check <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/">the documentation</a> on how you can do that.</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/buffer-k8s-infrastructure-nodes.jpg" alt="Buffer k8s nodes infrastructure"></p>
<p><strong>Assigning the correct CPU and memory request:</strong></p>
<p>The main worry we had was service using too much resources and leading to nodes becoming unresponsive. Because we now had great observability of all services running in our cluster (with Datadog), I’ve analyzed a few months of usage of each service we wanted to “unbound”. I’ve assigned the maximum CPU usage as the CPU request with a &gt; 20% margin. This will make sure to have allocated space in a node. If k8s won’t try to schedule any other service in that node.</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/choose-cpu-request-based-on-max.png" alt="Chose CPU request based on max"></p>
<p>You can see in the graph that the peak CPU usage was <code>242m</code> CPU core (0.242 CPU core). Simply take this number and make it a bit higher to become the CPU request. You can notice that since the service is user facing, the peak CPU usage matches peak traffic time.</p>
<p>Do the same with your memory usage and requests, and you will be all set!
To add more safety, you can use the horizontal pod autoscaler to create new pods if the resource usage is high, so kubernetes will schedule it in nodes that have room for it. Set an alert if your cluster do not have any room, or use the node austoscaler to add it automatically.</p>
<p>The downsides are that we lose in “<a href="https://wiki.openvz.org/WP/Containers_density">container density</a>”, the number of containers that can run in a single node. We could also end up with a lot of “slack” during a low traffic time.
You could also hit some high CPU usage, but nodes autoscaling should help you with it.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>I’m happy to publish really great results after few weeks of experimentation, we’ve already seen really great latency improvements across all the services we’ve modified:</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/speedup-no-cpu-limits2.png" alt="faster-kubernetes-containers"></p>
<p>The best result happened on our main landing page (<a href="https://buffer.com/">buffer.com</a>) where we speed the service up to <strong>22x</strong> faster!</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/no-cpu-limit-speedup-buffer-com.jpg" alt="buffer.com speedup without cpu limits"></p>
<h2 id="is-the-linux-kernel-bug-fixed">Is the Linux kernel bug fixed?</h2>
<p>The bug <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=763a9ec06c4">has been fixed and merged into the kernel</a> for Linux distribution running 4.19 or higher (kudo again to <a href="https://twitter.com/dchiluk">Dave Chiluk</a> for finding and fixing that).</p>
<p>However, as for <em>September 2nd 2020</em>, when reading <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/67577">the kubernetes issue</a>, we can see various Linux projects that keep referencing the issue, so I guess some Linux distribution still have the bug and working into integrating the fix.</p>
<p>If you are below a Linux distribution that has a kernel version below 4.19, I’d recommend you to upgrade to the latest Linux distribution for your nodes, but in any case, you should try removing the CPU limits and see if you have any throttling.  Here a non exhausting list of various managed Kubernetes services or Linux distribution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Debian: The latest version <a href="https://erickhun.com/posts/kubernetes-faster-services-no-cpu-limits/%5Bhttps://www.debian.org/releases/buster/">buster</a> has the fix,  it looks <a href="https://tracker.debian.org/news/1167353/accepted-linux-latest-419-105deb10u5deb9u1-source-amd64-into-oldstable-oldstable/">quite recent (august 2020)</a>. Some previous version might have get patched</li>
<li>Ubuntu: The latest version <a href="https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/">Ubuntu Focal Fosa 20.04</a> has the fix.</li>
<li>EKS has the fix since <a href="https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap/issues/175">December 2019</a>. Upgrade your AMI if you have a version below than that</li>
<li>kops: Since <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/9283">June 2020</a>,  <code>kops 1.18+</code> will start using <code>Ubuntu 20.04</code> as the default host image. If you’re using a lower version of kops, you’ll have to probably to wait the fix. We are currently in this situation.</li>
<li>GKE (Goggle Cloud) : The kernel fix was merged in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs/release-notes#cos-stable-77-12371-141-0">January 2020</a>. But it does looks like throttling are <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24356903">still hapenning</a></li>
</ul>
<p>ps: Feel free to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24351566">comment</a> if you have more precise information, I’ll update the post accordingly</p>
<p><strong>If the fix solved the throttling issue?</strong></p>
<p>I’m unsure if totally solved the issue. I will give it a try once we hit a kernel version where the fix has been implemented and will update this post accordingly. If anyone have upgrade I’m keen to hear their results.</p>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you run Docker containers under Linux (no matter Kubernetes/Mesos/Swarm) you might have your containers underperforming because of throttling</li>
<li>Upgrade to the latest version of your distribution hoping the bug is fixed</li>
<li>Removing CPU limit is a solution to solve this issue, but this is dangerous and should be made with extra-care (prefer upgrading your kernel first and monitor throttling first)</li>
<li>If you remove CPU limits, carefully monitor CPU and  memory usage in your nodes, and make sure your CPU requests are</li>
<li>A safe way to is to use the Horizontal pod autoscaler to create new pods if the resource usage is high, so kubernetes will schedule it in nodes that have space.</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Supervised learning is perhaps the most common form of machine learning task in use nowadays.</p>
<p>This form of learning makes use of a labeled training dataset to create a model that predicts a target of interest. If this line makes absolutely no sense to you, don't worry. After reading this article you will have a clear understanding of supervised learning and its two most popular applications: regression and classification.</p>
<h2 id="trainingmachineswithexamples">Training machines with examples</h2>
<p>Supervised learning is a process in which you teach a machine to predict a particular result by feeding it examples 'with the right answers'.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to know is what are you trying to predict. You might want to create a program that classifies pet photos as <em>dog photos</em> or <em>cat photos</em>, or a program that predicts the prices of houses in different districts in Sydney, Australia.</p>
<p>After deciding the variable you are trying to predict (your <strong>target</strong>), it's time to gather data examples from the real world and <em>label them</em>. In our first example, we would start gathering photos with dogs and photos with cats and tagging them with the right category. This photo of a puppy is a dog photo, that photo of a cat playing with a laser is a cat photo, and so on for every example.</p>
<p>Before the training stage, you will set aside a percentage of your training set to test the performance of your models. Afterwards, you will feed your labeled examples into an algorithm that will learn to generalize a relationship between the inputs (the photos) and the targets (dog/cat), producing a model you can use to classify fresh images it has never seen before. In this context, this is what <em>training</em> means: teaching a machine to perform actions learned from training data.</p>
<p>You can evaluate how well the model performs on your training set, the one you put aside before training. If the results are satisfying, you can deploy the model into production and use it to solve the original problem. The following diagram shows a high-level view of the supervised learning process.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/11/SupervisedLearning.png" alt="SupervisedLearning"></p>
<p>This is an example of a classification task.</p>
<p><strong>Classification</strong> and <strong>regression</strong> are the most common applications of supervised learning. If you are interested in a career in machine learning you will likely spend most of your time creating these types of models, so let's take a look at them.</p>
<h2 id="classifyingtheworld">Classifying the world</h2>
<p>A classifier is a model that tells you the <strong>class</strong>(category) an instance of your data belongs to. In the previous example, our instances were photos of pets, and the classes were <em>cat photos</em> and <em>dog photos</em>.</p>
<p>The training set for classification tasks is usually a collection of instances (individual instances of the phenomenon you are trying to model) with a <em>label</em> that specifies the class they belong to.</p>
<p>Classifiers can be further classified ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° ) into different subtypes depending on the number of target classes (binary or multiclass) and how many categories an instance can belong to at the same time (single-label and multi-label), let's take a look at those.</p>
<h4 id="binaryclassifiers">Binary classifiers</h4>
<p>A binary classifier is a model that classifies examples into two possible classes. Classifiers are capable of telling you if an email is either <strong>spam</strong> or <strong>not spam</strong>, if a photo of a face is <strong>happy</strong> or <strong>sad</strong> or if a substance is <strong>harmless</strong> or <strong>dangerous</strong>.</p>
<p>The most common setup for binary classification is to have a positive class (<em>class</em>) and a negative class (<em>not-class</em>). In this sense, you can re-define the previous examples as spam/not-spam, happy/not-happy and dangerous/not-dangerous.</p>
<p>Some types of binary classifiers don't just tell you a result, but they also provide you a probability that the instance you are classifying belongs to the predicted class.</p>
<p>Binary classifiers are some of the most studied and used models in machine learning, and many other models build on top of them (like some forms of multiclass classifiers).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/11/BinaryClassifier.png" alt="BinaryClassifier"></p>
<h4 id="multiclassclassifiers">Multiclass classifiers</h4>
<p>As you might imagine from the title, a multiclass classifier is a model that classifies instances into many categories. Like in the previous case you can get the results as the probability of belonging to a particular class.</p>
<p>It's important to note that there is a difference depending on the number of classes an instance can belong to at the same time.</p>
<p>If the classes are mutually exclusive (an object can only belong to one class at a time) you are building a <strong>single-label multiclass classifier</strong>. If an instance can belong to more than 1 class at the same time then you need a <strong>multi-label classifier</strong>.</p>
<p>Depending on the particular scenario, your choice of algorithms and evaluation methods will differ.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/11/MulticlassClassifier.png" alt="MulticlassClassifier"></p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/11/MultilabelClassifier.png" alt="MultilabelClassifier"></p>
<h2 id="regression">Regression</h2>
<p>The goal of a regression model is to predict a continuous value. The training set for a regression problem is usually a collection of instances with the associated numeric value you are trying to predict.</p>
<p>The following are some examples of regression problems</p>
<ul>
<li>Predict the price of houses in Amsterdam given the size of the house (in square meters), the year the house was built, the average income of the area in which the house is located, the number of bedrooms and the color of the mailbox.</li>
<li>Predict a person's likelihood developing diabetes given the height, weight, number of cigarettes smoked per day, average caloric intake, average hours of physical activity per week and amount of carbs consumed per day.</li>
<li>Predict the stock price of a company one year from now based on the number of Disney films released last year, the color of underwear the CEO wears with more frequency and the title of his/her aunt's favorite song.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regression tasks are extremely common in machine learning. If you decide to pursue a career in data science or ML engineering, many of the models you'll build are likely aimed to solve regression problems.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/11/SimpleRegressor.png" alt="SimpleRegressor"></p>
<h2 id="thecoreassumptionofsupervisedlearning">The core assumption of supervised learning</h2>
<p>Ok, now you have an idea of what supervised learning is and how the process works. In brief, you collect a lot of data relevant to the problem you are trying to solve and label it with the <em>correct answers</em>, or the expected result your model is trying to predict. Then, all this training data is fed into an algorithm that will generate a model that maps the inputs into classes(classification) or values(regression).</p>
<p>For this process to work, the information contained in the training set needs to have enough <strong>predictive power</strong> for the algorithm to find a correlation between the two sets.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to predict the likelihood a given person has to develop diabetes, you might want data like the BMI, genetic predisposition and dietary habits. All 3 with powerful correlation with the variable you are trying to find (likelihood to develop a disease, in this case). Other data, like favorite film, shoe size, and favorite headphone brand has less predictive power for this particular target, so it makes little sense to add it to the training set.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the data gathered doesn't provide enough information to build a model that performs well, in this scenario you need to reformulate the problem or find data with better quality.</p>
<p>Supervised learning is a huge topic with lots of important concepts. The goal of this article was to present a high-level view of the topic. Hopefully, by now you have a better understanding of supervised learning, and we will be prepared to dig deeper in more elaborate topics in future articles.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Starting an IHP app</strong>

                    <p>
                        Let's first take a look at what happens when you start your IHP app by running <code>./start</code>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp-boilerplate/blob/master/start" target="_blank"><code>./start</code></a> script in your project is basically just a small wrapper that makes sure that all dependencies that are managed by nix are available and then calls the <code>RunDevServer</code> binary. <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/blob/master/IHP/IDE/DevServer.hs" target="_blank">This binary is part of IHP</a> and does the actual application startup as well as managing the postgres server.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You can think of <code>RunDevServer</code> as a small process manager. When <code>RunDevServer</code> is started, it will directly start all processes required for your application to run:
                        </p><ul>
                            <li>the web-based IDE</li>
                            <li>a status server on port 8000 showing the compiler status and possible type errors</li>
                            <li>a websocket server used for communicating file changes for live reloading</li>
                            <li>a ghci (the standard haskell REPL) where it directly loads your app</li>
                            <li>a postgres server bound to unix socket</li>
                            <li>a file watcher to track haskell and css file changes</li>
                        </ul>
                    

                    <p>
                        All these processes are started in parallel for fast performance and synchronised in the main event loop of the dev server. Made possible thanks to haskells great concurrency capabilities.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The most important process is the ghci process with your app. Instead of fully recompiling your app on every file change, IHP loads your app in the repl and then refreshes only the changed files. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At first ghci needs a couple of seconds to load all haskell files of your application. While loading your application the status server is serving all http requests on localhost:8000. The status server will also show all type errors in case ghci failed to load your app. When the ghci finished loading, the status server is stopped and your application is started on localhost:8000.
                    </p>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Haskell File Changes</strong>

                    <p>
                        <iframe width="100%" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nTjjDo57B8g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once your application is started, the dev server mainly deals with file changes. Using a file watcher the dev server is notified about any changes to your haskell files in your project. When a haskell file is changed the app process running in the ghci process is stopped and a refresh (<code>:r</code>) is triggered. The refresh is usually very fast. Once completed the app server will be started again.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once the haskell app has started, open browser pages will be notified using a websocket connection. The open pages will fetch the current page via ajax and will then update the dom using <a href="https://github.com/patrick-steele-idem/morphdom" target="_blank">a diff and patch approach</a>. So only dom nodes that have actually changed will be touched during the live reloading. This approach will keep existing page state like scroll position or text typed into a form field. It allows for a very fast and productive feedback cycle.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>CSS File Changes</strong>

                    <blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Did you know: <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ihp?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ihp</a> also supports live reloading of CSS. <a href="https://t.co/uRCCr3gkHz">pic.twitter.com/uRCCr3gkHz</a></p>— digitally induced (@digitallyinduce) <a href="https://twitter.com/digitallyinduce/status/1277583045919375363?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2020</a></blockquote> 
                    

                    <p>
                        IHP also supports live reloading of CSS files. Once IHP sees a file change to your CSS files in the <code>static</code> directory it will notify all open browser tabs using its websocket connection. Once notified in the browser IHP will look for any <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet"&gt;</code> and <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/blob/master/lib/IHP/static/livereload.js#L68" target="_blank">will reload the css file using a cache buster</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is only possible because nix allows us to pin down the set of package definitions to a specific git commit of the nix package registry.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Type Errors</strong>

                        Sometimes you make a change which will stop your application from compiling. In these error cases the status server jumps in and starts listening on localhost:8000. The status server will then display the error message so you can quickly fix it:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Additionally open browser tabs will be notified about this and will refresh. This way the error is instantly visible to you.

                        While the above steps are technically complicated, when doing actual development you will not see much of this complexity.  Lots of time have been spent to find the best approach and smoothing out all the edge cases. The whole process is very much inspired by PHP where you just make file changes and it works. The live reloading really <q>just works</q>.

                        The dev server is the heart of IHP and makes the dev process extremely productive. You get all the benefits of type-safety with the development speed you previously only got with scripting languages. If you haven't already it's time to try it out! 🚀

September 2, 2020 | https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2020/09/02/wparentheses/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2020/09/02/wparentheses/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Today I finally write down some musings on two peripheral aspects of
compiler diagnostic design that I think are very important for certain kinds of warnings.
My first musing relates to <em>fixits</em>, and my second to <em>suppression mechanisms</em>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-fixit">What is a fixit?</h2>

<p>Most C++ compilers these days don’t just tell you <em>that</em> a problem occurred
(like <a href="https://www.gnu.org/fun/jokes/ed-msg.txt"><code>ed</code>’s famous <code>?</code> prompt</a>),
and <em>what</em> the problem is (“expected identifier,” for example).
They’ll try to tell you <em>how to fix</em> the problem.</p>

<p>Compare GCC 4.1’s error messages with GCC 4.6’s. (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/KM8P9E">Godbolt.</a>)
For this input:</p>



<p>GCC 4.1 complains merely that you have put <code>multiple types in one declaration</code>.
GCC 4.6 more helpfully complains that it <code>expected ';' after struct definition</code>,
and points to the exact position where it believes a semicolon should be inserted.</p>

<p>GCC 7 goes even further, and suggests a <em>fixit</em> — a machine-readable “spellcheck suggestion”
that some IDEs are able to apply with a single click.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>test.cc:1:12: error: expected ';' after struct definition
 struct S {}
            ^
            ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In medical terms, the compiler has gone from simply detecting the <em>symptom</em>
(“this declaration seems to contain two types, which isn’t valid C++”)
to producing a <em>diagnosis</em> of the disease (“I bet you forgot a semicolon somewhere”);
and a compiler that supports fixits is actually <em>prescribing a treatment plan</em>.
Each of these steps is a quantum leap beyond the previous one in terms of both user-friendliness
and implementation complexity.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-suppression-mechanism">What is a suppression mechanism?</h2>

<p>Suppression mechanisms relate to compiler <em>warnings</em>, not compiler errors.
Consider the following snippet (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/fTnao9">Godbolt</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if (argc = 1)
    puts("hello");
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Every mainstream compiler warns on this suspicious-looking code (GCC and Clang with <code>-Wall</code>; MSVC with <code>-W4</code>).
Here’s GCC’s diagnostic:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: suggest parentheses around assignment used as truth value [-Wparentheses]
    4 |     if (argc = 1)
      |         ~~~~~^~~
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that GCC doesn’t even bother to explain really what its diagnosis is;
it emits a passive-aggressive warning message that does nothing more than suggest how to
shut itself up!</p>

<p>The diagnosis, of course, is that frequently people mean to write <code>if (argc == 1)</code>
but their finger slips and they write <code>if (argc = 1)</code> instead, which unfortunately
is also valid C++ code. Every mainstream compiler has evolved the same way to deal with this:
if you really mean <code>=</code>, then you write an extra pair of parentheses around the expression, like so:</p>



<p>The extra pair of parentheses is what I’m calling a “suppression mechanism.”
It’s just an arbitrary way of silencing a warning diagnostic — telling the compiler
“no, I really <em>meant</em> to write this legal but unusual construct.”</p>

<p>Another well-known suppression mechanism is writing <code>(void)</code> in front of unused results
to silence <code>-Wunused-value</code> and <code>-Wunused-result</code> warnings (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/WdrhrE">Godbolt</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[[nodiscard]] int foo();
void test(int x) {
    (void)x;
    (void)foo();
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And a trivial suppression mechanism is implied by the name of the <code>-Wparentheses</code> warning:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: '&amp;&amp;' within '||' [-Wlogical-op-parentheses]
    return (a &amp;&amp; b || c);
            ~~^~~~ ~~
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here the compiler just wants you to add a pair of parentheses to clarify the precedence for the reader.</p>

<h2 id="musing-a-single-fixit-must-preserve-actual-behavior-or-likely-intent-but-cant-do-both">Musing: A single fixit must preserve (actual) behavior or (likely) intent, but can’t do both</h2>

<p>It’s easy for the programmer to “fix” diagnostics like <code>-Wunused-result</code> and <code>-Wlogical-op-parentheses</code>,
because they’re just asking the programmer to clarify intent that is already pretty clear:
<em>Yes</em>, I mean to discard this result. <em>Yes</em>, I mean to evaluate <code>(a &amp;&amp; b) || c</code>.</p>

<p>The more interesting diagnostics are the ones where the compiler believes it has identified a mismatch
between the code’s actual <em>behavior</em> and the programmer’s <em>intent</em>. Our <code>if (argc = 1)</code> example
above was like that. A more realistic example might be something like</p>



<p>Here it is almost certain that the programmer intended to write</p>



<p>However, the literal behavior of the code as written is equivalent to</p>



<p>When the compiler suggests a fixit for this warning, it has to choose: Should we suggest the fix
that changes the behavior of the code to what you probably meant to type — the “spellcheck” option?
Or should we show how to silence the warning while preserving the existing code’s behavior — the
“Add To Dictionary” option, if you will? (Or, continuing our medical analogy, there’s the “treatment”
option and the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_not_resuscitate">DNR</a>” option.)</p>

<p>Showing just the “treatment” option puts the compiler in the awkward position of “recommending” that you change
the behavior of code that is, after all, perfectly legal C++ already; blindly applying the fixit to
working code might break that code. But showing just the “suppression” option might encourage a programmer to
blindly apply the fixit to <em>broken</em> code, thus leaving the bug in place but making it harder to detect
in the future.</p>

<p>For certain kinds of warnings, Clang shows <em>both</em> fixits. Two examples of this in Clang 10
are (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/aWf9s6">Godbolt</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: using the result of an assignment as a condition without parentheses [-Wparentheses]
    if (x = foo())
        ~~^~~~~~~
note: place parentheses around the assignment to silence this warning
    if (x = foo())
          ^
        (        )
note: use '==' to turn this assignment into an equality comparison
     if (x = foo())
          ^
          ==
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: &amp; has lower precedence than !=; != will be evaluated first [-Wparentheses]
    return (foo() &amp; mask != 0);
                  ^~~~~~~~~~~
note: place parentheses around the '!=' expression to silence this warning
    return (foo() &amp; mask != 0);
                  ^
                    (        )
note: place parentheses around the &amp; expression to evaluate it first
    return (foo() &amp; mask != 0);
                  ^
            (           )
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that in both cases, Clang decides to print the “suppression” option first
and the “treatment” option second.
But sometimes Clang prints the “treatment” option first and the “suppression” option second:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: size argument in 'strncmp' call is a comparison [-Wmemsize-comparison]
    return strncmp(a, b, len &lt; 0);
                         ~~~~^~~
note: did you mean to compare the result of 'strncmp' instead?
    return strncmp(a, b, len &lt; 0);
           ^                    ~
                            )
note: explicitly cast the argument to size_t to silence this warning
    return strncmp(a, b, len &lt; 0);
                         ^
                         (size_t)( )
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: logical not is only applied to the left hand side of this comparison [-Wlogical-not-parentheses]
    return x == y &amp;&amp; !x == z;
                     ^  ~~
note: add parentheses after the '!' to evaluate the comparison first
    return x == y &amp;&amp; !x == z;
                     ^
                      (     )
note: add parentheses around left hand side expression to silence this warning
    return x == y &amp;&amp; !x == z;
                     ^
                     ( )
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Of course, there are many more cases where Clang emits <em>only</em> the “suppression” option
as a fixit, leaving the programmer to figure out the “treatment” on their own. (GCC 10.2
emits a fixit for only the last of these four examples; and it’s the “suppression” option.)</p>

<p>Even in the absence of any machine-readable fixits, the phrasing of the warning message
itself can induce the human reader to think in terms of suppression or in
terms of treatment. A warning message can be phrased as “Please confirm that you meant X”;
or “You did X; did you mean Y?”; or even as “Your attempt to do Y failed.”</p>

<h2 id="musing-suppression-mechanisms-are-about-edit-distance-and-about-signaling">Musing: Suppression mechanisms are about edit distance, and about signaling</h2>

<p>Compiler warnings of the kind we’re discussing here are basically of the form
“You wrote X, but I think you meant Y.” This happens only when X and Y are
in some sense <em>close together</em>. Sometimes the “closeness” is semantic, not syntactic
(as when the programmer means to invoke copy elision but writes <code>return std::move(x)</code> instead).
But for our purposes today, let’s just think about <em>syntactic</em> closeness. You meant
to write Y, but a minor typographical slip caused you to write X. In the examples above,
the slips are things like “omit one <code>=</code>,” or “omit a pair of parens” or
“put <code>&lt; 0</code> inside the parens instead of outside.”</p>

<p>Take X=”equality-compare <code>!a</code> to <code>b</code>” and Y=”negate the sense of <code>a == b</code>.”
There are some pieces of code that clearly intend to express X, such as <code>(!a)==(b)</code>.
There are some that clearly intend to express Y, such as <code>a != b</code>.
But you wrote <code>(!a==b)</code>, which falls into a gray area: it’s not clear which of
X and Y you really intended to express.</p>

<p>The job of the compiler-diagnostic-developer is to create some separation between
the space of inputs that the compiler considers “clearly X”
and the space of inputs that the compiler considers “clearly Y.”
Essentially, we create an error-correcting code by deliberately increasing the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance">edit distance</a>
between pairs of inequivalent C++ programs — deliberately increasing the number of keystrokes
the programmer would have to screw up in order to transform a working (and warning-free)
C++ program into an inequivalent broken (yet warning-free) C++ program.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in cases where Y is more commonly intended than X, it should be relatively <em>easier</em>
to write Y than X. In our example that’s true even at the core-language level: <code>a != b</code> is
already easier to write than <code>!a == b</code>. But when we increase the distance between X-space and Y-space,
we shrink X-space by more than we shrink Y-space. If you really intend to express <code>!a == b</code>, we’ll force you
to retreat all the way to <code>(!a) == b</code>. This is kind of analogous to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_(economics)">signaling principle</a>
in economics or evolutionary biology: Basically, if you want the compiler to accept your intent,
your code must adopt some cumbersome and frankly maladaptive ornamentation in order to <em>prove</em>
its worthiness to the compiler.</p>

<p>According to the prevailing theory of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handicap_principle">sexual selection in the animal kingdom</a>,
when a peahen is deciding whether to accept
a particular peacock, she uses …</p></div></div>

This material is collected on disk as PCAP files containing any form of handshake supported by hashcat, including full and half WPA handshakes as well as PMKIDs. Or put quickly, it's a tamagochi who eats WiFi handshakes to be happy.</p><p>Hash Monster runs in a smaller size and cheaper platform superior to the Pwnagotchi in several aspects. While Pwnagotchi is based on the Raspberry Pi Zero and requires assembling a DIY kit with various components such as an eInk screen and an external powerbank, the Hash Monster works on directly on the tiny M5Stack device. M5 Stack couples an ESP32 with a small LCD display, buttons and internal battery. It’s a modular, stackable, scalable, and portable device which is powered with an ESP-32 core, which makes it open source, low cost, full-function, and easy for developers to handle ESP32 IoT product development. You can program M5Stack through Arduino, C++, Blockly or MicroPython to name a few. The complete development kit for M5 Stack just under $45 provides a friendly price and full-featured resources which makes it a good starter kit for you to explore ESP32. While the M5 Stack includes a built-in battery 110mAh, it can be upgraded with a stackable 700 mAh lipo battery extension module.</p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/615059260bcadb5085e71de543154bec6c52222f5d1efda91cdcafdbe403cce2.png"></p><p>The similarity between Pwnagotchi and Hash Monster is that they capture both PSK handshakes from WPA / WPA2 networks and PSK hashes contained in beacon frames with PMKID. A great advantage of PMKID cracking is that everything you need is available over the air even if there are no stations connected and only a single packet capture is required. Later we can crack these hashes with standard tools such as aircrack or hashcat, and thus obtain the credentials. Of course, we should only do this in networks that we manage ourselves or that we have permission to audit.</p><p><strong>The process.</strong></p><p>Hardware requirements:</p><ul><li><a href="https://bit.ly/3jFAnl8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">M5Stack CORE Development Kit</a> with built-in 110mAh Battery ($45)</li></ul><p>Optionally:</p><ul><li><a href="https://bit.ly/3gYtI48" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Extended Battery M5Stack Core Development Kit Capacity 700mAh Stackable Module</a> (USD$12)</li><li><a href="https://www.banggood.com/M5Stack-Multi-function-Digital-Watch-with-700mAh-Battery-for-M5Stack-ESP32-Core-p-1551727.html?rmmds=search&amp;cur_warehouse=CN" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Smart Watch Module with 700mAh Battery for M5Stack ESP32 Core</a> ($15)</li></ul><p>The software installation is pretty straight forward:</p><p>1.Setup Arduino IDE environment.</p><p><em>M5Stack Arduino IDE Setup in 5 minutes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2es-l4z2Zg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2es-l4z2Zg</a></em></p><p>2.

We will do this with two known tools – Aircrack-ng and Hashcat, which relies respectively on CPU and GPU power. We will be running these tools from linux, even though they are both found in a Windows version as well. Remember to use recent versions to benefit from the PMKID attack in addition to the traditional cracking of handshakes.</p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/adb3724e47a02d9fe14b83454cae422f882a9c99ccc78f0f2db6ef6e7a7f6f9b.png"></p><p>Aircrack-ng can be used for very basic dictionary attacks running on your CPU. Before you run the attack you need a wordlist. I recommend using the infamous rockyou dictionary file:</p><p># download the 134MB rockyou dictionary file</p><pre><code><code>curl -L -o rockyou.txt https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt</code></code></pre><p>Note, that if the network password is not in the wordlist you will not crack the password.</p><p># -a2 specifies WPA2, -b is the BSSID, -w is the wordfile</p><pre><code><code>aircrack-ng -a2 -b AC:FC:E3:C9:AB:C0 -w rockyou.txt 3.cap</code></code></pre><p>If the password is cracked you will see a KEY FOUND! message in the terminal followed by the plain text version of the network password.</p><p>Cracking an WiFi password using brute force attack for a long WiFi password without GPUs or Cloud help, will be a nightmare but if the password is short or you know the key pattern it will be "easily" cracked.</p><p>Here you have a small guide for linux (Ubuntu) to crack the WiFi password using the files stored on the SD_Card of the Purple Hash Monster using your computer.</p><p>First we need to install <strong>hashcat</strong></p><pre><code><code>sudo apt-get update</code><br>
<code> sudo apt install hashcat</code></code></pre><p>EAPOL/PMKID stored on the SD-Card are <em>pcap</em> files, we have to convert to <em>hccapx</em> format to work with hashcat. In terminal from the directory were we have the <em>pcap</em> file from the SD-CARD:</p><pre><code><code>wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hashcat/hashcat-utils/master/src/cap2hccapx.c</code><br>
<code> gcc -o cap2hccapx cap2hccapx.c</code><br>
<code> ./cap2hccapx 1.pcap 1.hccapx</code></code></pre><p>For example if we know that the wifi password has a lenght of 8 digits we can run the following command, and in few seconds we will have the WiFi Password :)</p><pre><code><code>hashcat --force -m 2500 -a 3 -1 ?d -o cracked 1.hccapx ?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1</code></code></pre><p><strong>Final notes</strong></p><p>Although in my case I exclusively use the M5 Stack for the pocket monster hash, there are undoubtedly several projects that run on the M5 Stack and you will certainly want to take a look if you are interested in wifi and bluetooth security attack tools for this platform.</p><p>M5 Stack WiFi SSID Scanner by Elkentaro</p><p><a href="https://github.com/elkentaro/M5_SSID_scanner_collector" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/elkentaro/M5_SSID_scanner_collector</a></p><p>Covid Sniffer: BLE COVID exposure app sniffer using M5 Stack</p><p><a href="https://gitlab.com/mschmidl/covidsniffer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gitlab.com/mschmidl/covidsniffer</a></p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/02ee78aa44062073eb950642e19a44a548daf55d3217643f1a98cc84d37bc7d6.jpeg"></p></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p><code>API</code> is the acronym for Application Programming Interface which defines interactions between multiple software architecture layers. Programmers carry out complex tasks easily using APIs in software development. Without APIs, a programmer's life would have been miserable with no proper(security, for example) access to data,  knowing unnecessary low level details etc.</p>
<p>When it comes to Web APIs, there are extremely useful  objects, properties and functions available to perform tasks as minor as accessing DOM to as complex as managing audios, videos, graphics, etc. </p>

<p>If you are from the web development background, you are using many of them already. Here is the list of very well known web APIs.</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">Canvas</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">Fetch</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API">History</a> </li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API">Geolocation</a> </li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model">DOM</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console_API">Console</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API">Drag &amp; Drop API</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In this article, I am going to talk about 10 more web APIs that are not so popular. Lesser popular doesn't mean, they are not useful. You can use them in various use-cases of your project. Please have a look.</p>

<p>If you would like to jump into the source code or see the demonstration immediately, here are the quick links to them:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/atapas/demolab/tree/master/code/src/demos/web-apis">Link to the Source Code @GitHub</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://demo.greenroots.info/categories/web-apis/">Link to the Web API DemoLab</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: Web APIs are nothing but the interfaces, functions, objects, properties written and exposed using vanilla JavaScript. However the usage of the web APIs is not limited to the vanilla JavaScript based application alone. It is very straightforward to use them with an Angular, React or Vue based applications as well.</p>
<p>All the examples I have used to demonstrate the web apis in this article are written using reactjs. You can find them in the github link mentioned above. Please feel free to fork, change and use!</p>

<p>A big (pain) point about  using a web API is, most of them are not standardized yet. It means, the support for a web API  may differ from one browser vendor to another. For example, You may find an API working with the Chrome browser but, not supported by Firefox or Edge browsers yet.</p>
<p>I would suggest a couple of ways to have a check on this,</p>


<p>Alright, time to get started knowing them. Hope you also find these useful.</p>
<h2 id="1-fullscreen-api">1. 📺 Fullscreen API</h2>
<p>Do you have the need to show any of the DOM elements in full-screen mode? The full-screen use-case is very demanding for gaming applications, online video platforms(like, youtube) etc. </p>
<p>The <code>Fullscreen API</code> provides methods to present a specific Element (and its children) in a full-screen mode. There is a method available to exit full-screen mode once it is no longer needed. Not only that, this API can also help to perform any actions when a DOM element transition into a full-screen mode or comes out of it.</p>
<p>In the example below, my favorite Santa Claus can get into the full-screen mode and come out of it with ease.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598715764074/fR7trCfsA.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="full_screen.gif"></p>
<p>In the code below, the <code>manageFullScreen()</code> function uses  the <code>requestFullscreen()</code> API on an element which is having an id called, <code>fs_id</code>. </p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> manageFullscreen = () =&gt; {
   <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'fs_id'</span>).requestFullscreen();
}
</code></pre>
<p>This element with id, <code>fs_id</code> is a <code>DIV</code> with a child element, i.e, the Santa Clause image.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div className=<span>"column"</span>&gt;
  <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>id</span>=<span>"fs_id"</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>Img</span> <span>fixed</span>=<span>{imageData.image.childImageSharp.fixed}</span> <span>alt</span>=<span>"santa"</span> /&gt;</span>
   <span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>

    <span>&lt;<span>StyledButton</span> 
         <span>onClick</span>=<span>{manageFullscreen}</span>&gt;</span>
            Enter Fullscreen with Santa
    <span>&lt;/<span>StyledButton</span>&gt;</span>
 <span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>You can check if the <code>Fullscreen API</code> is supported by the browser,</p>
<pre><code><span>if</span> (<span>document</span>.fullscreenEnabled) {
   setSupported(<span>true</span>);
} <span>else</span> {
   setSupported(<span>false</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Also watch out for the useful handlers like,</p>
<ul>
<li><code>onfullscreenchange</code>: An event handler for the fullscreenchange event.</li>
<li><code>onfullscreenerror</code>: An event handler for the fullscreenerror event.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-clipboard-async-api">2. 📋 Clipboard Async API</h2>
<p>What is a clipboard in comuping?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The clipboard is a buffer that some operating systems provide for short-term storage and transfer within and between application programs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are mainly three operations you can perform with the clipboard. They are, <code>copy</code>, <code>cut</code> and <code>paste</code>. The Clipboard API provides the ability to respond to these three operations. </p>
<p>Interestingly, copying content to the clipboard is open as in, there is no need of a user permission. However, for pasting the content from the clipboard to the user application, the user needs to grant permission for it. It is achieved using another web API called, <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Permissions_API">Permission API</a></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598716493747/PwPwDDK8Y.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>Here is a simple example of the copy-paste operation,</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598716547383/PoXUNZmnr.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="clip_board.gif"></p>
<p>This is how to check if the feature is supported by the browser,</p>
<pre><code><span>if</span> (navigator.clipboard 
     &amp;&amp; navigator.clipboard.read 
     &amp;&amp; navigator.clipboard.write) {
   setSupported(<span>true</span>);
} <span>else</span> {
   setSupported(<span>false</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the async API function for writing the content to the clipboard,</p>
<pre><code><span>async</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>performCopy</span>(<span>event</span>) </span>{
   event.preventDefault();
   <span>try</span> {
      <span>await</span> navigator.clipboard.writeText(copyText);
      <span>console</span>.log(<span>`<span>${copyText}</span> copied to clipboard`</span>);
   } <span>catch</span> (err) {
      <span>console</span>.error(<span>'Failed to copy: '</span>, err);
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The Async API function to read the content from the clipboard and do something with it,</p>
<pre><code><span>async</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>performPaste</span>(<span>event</span>) </span>{
   event.preventDefault();
   <span>try</span> {
       <span>const</span> text = <span>await</span> navigator.clipboard.readText();
       setPastetext(text);
       <span>console</span>.log(<span>'Pasted content: '</span>, text);
   } <span>catch</span> (err) {
      <span>console</span>.error(<span>'Failed to read clipboard contents: '</span>, err);
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note: With the inclusion of the <code>Clipboard Async API</code>, you can get rid of the usage of <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/execCommand">document.execCommad()</a> function as it is obsolete now.</p>

<h2 id="3-resize-observer-api">3. 🧐 Resize Observer API</h2>
<p>Do you want to take some actions based on the changes to the content or border box of a DOM element? Are you thinking of writing a handler by yourself? What if I tell you, there is already one provided by the web API implementation?</p>
<p>Here is a story about a dumb button. We use a range slider to resize the button. While the button gets resized, we also want to control the text color, without letting the button know much about it. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598717277220/dITL6Nog2.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="resizer.gif"></p>
<p>First, create a button and specify an id so that, we can access the button later using the id.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;StyledButton id=<span>"dumbBtnId"</span>&gt;
   I am a Dumb Button
&lt;<span>/StyledButton&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now we create a slider using the <code>range</code> input type from HTML5. A <code>resize()</code> function is invoked when the slider value changes.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
   <span><span>&lt;<span>input</span> 
         <span>onChange</span>=<span>{(event)</span> =&gt;</span> resize(event)} 
         type="range" 
         min={minRange} 
         max={maxRange} 
         defaultValue={rangeValue} /&gt;
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>resize()</code> function simply sets the width of the button as the slider range value so that, it can be resized dynamically.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> resize = event =&gt; {
   <span>const</span> value = event.target.valueAsNumber;
   setRangeValue(value);
   <span>let</span> dumbBtn = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'dumbBtnId'</span>);
   dumbBtn.style.width = <span>`<span>${value}</span>px`</span>;
 }
</code></pre>
<p>So far, so good? Now for every range value change, the button gets resized. We have a <code>ResizeObserver</code> observing this change and change the color of the button text.</p>
<pre><code>useEffect(() =&gt; {
   <span>try</span> {
            <span>let</span> dumbBtn = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'dumbBtnId'</span>);
            <span>var</span> resizeObserver = <span>new</span> ResizeObserver(entries =&gt; {
                <span>for</span>(<span>const</span> entry <span>of</span> entries) {
                    
                    
                   entry.target.style.color = <span>'green`;
                }
      });
      resizeObserver.observe(dumbBtn);
   } catch(e) {
            setSupported(false);
            console.log(e);      
   }
}, [rangeValue]);</span>
</code></pre>

<p>There are some cool and useful APIs around user media like, audio, video etc. I love the <code>Image Capture API</code> which helps us to capture an image or grab a frame from the video devices(like webcam). Not only that, you can also perform actions on capturing an image or grabbing a frame.</p>
<p>First, get the user media access. In this case we are getting the webcam access.</p>
<pre><code>navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({video: <span>true</span>})
  .then(mediaStream =&gt; {
     <span>document</span>.querySelector(<span>'video'</span>).srcObject = mediaStream;
     <span>const</span> track = mediaStream.getVideoTracks()[<span>0</span>];
     setTrack(track);
  }).catch(error =&gt; {
     <span>console</span>.error(<span>` <span>${error}</span> is not yet supported`</span>);
     setError(error);
});
</code></pre>
<p>Just like the clipboard paste operation, a webcam media access permission has to be granted by the user.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598717565379/MCRNY49Tl.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>Now Grab a frame and do something. In this example, I am just drawing the frame on a Canvas.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> imageCapture = <span>new</span> ImageCapture(track);
    imageCapture.grabFrame()
      .then(imageBitmap =&gt; {
          <span>const</span> canvas = <span>document</span>.querySelector(<span>'#grabFrameCanvas'</span>);
          drawCanvas(canvas, imageBitmap);
    }).catch(error =&gt; {
          <span>console</span>.log(error);
          setError(error);
});
</code></pre>
<p>I can also take a picture and do the similar thing.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> imageCapture = <span>new</span> ImageCapture(track);
    imageCapture.takePhoto().then(blob =&gt; createImageBitmap(blob))
      .then(imageBitmap =&gt; {
          <span>const</span> canvas = <span>document</span>.querySelector(<span>'#takePhotoCanvas'</span>);
          drawCanvas(canvas, imageBitmap);
    }).catch(error =&gt; {
          <span>console</span>.log(error);
          setError(error);
});
</code></pre>
<p>To stop the video streaming from the webcam, just call he method <code>stop()</code> on the running video track.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> videoOff = () =&gt; {
   track.stop();
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Also watch out for the methods,</p>
<ul>
<li><code>getPhotoCapabilities()</code>: To get the ranges of available configuration options.</li>
<li><code>getPhotoSettings()</code>: To get the current photo configuration settings.</li>
</ul>

        <p>With this year’s <a href="https://icml.cc/Conferences/2020">International Conference on Machine Learning&nbsp;(ICML)</a>
being over, it is time to have another instalment of this series.
Similar to <a href="http://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2019/icml_tda_roundup/">last year’s post</a>, I shall cover
several papers that caught my attention because of their use of
topological concepts—however, <em>unlike</em> last year, I shall not
restrict the selection to papers using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_data_analysis">topological data analysis&nbsp;(TDA)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Caveat lector:</strong> I might have missed some promising papers. Any
suggestions for additions are more than welcome! Please reach out

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04881">Learning Flat Latent Manifolds with VAEs</a>
by <a href="https://argmax.ai/team/nutan-chen">Nutan Chen</a>, <a href="https://www.argmax.ai/team/alexej-klushyn">Alexej Klushyn</a>,
Francesco Ferroni, <a href="http://bayerj.github.io/">Justin Bayer</a>, and
<a href="https://argmax.ai/team/patrick-van-der-smagt">Patrick van der Smagt</a>
discusses an interesting modification of variational autoencoders, viz.
an extended loss term that regularises the latent space to be
<em>flat</em>&nbsp;(i.e. having no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature">curvature</a>).
The main idea is to ensure that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor">Riemannian metric tensor</a>
is the identity matrix.</p>
<p>The ingenious implication of such a latent space is that the Euclidean
distance is a good proxy for the similarity between data points, whereas
this is <em>not</em> a priori the case for other latent spaces. It is interesting
to note that there is a ‘sibling’ paper to this one, which was published
at ICLR 2020, namely <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=S1g6xeSKDS">Mixed-curvature Variational Autoencoders</a>.
This paper presents an autoencoder whose latent space is a product of
Riemannian manifolds, whose curvature is either fixed or learnable.</p>
<p>I am glad to see that curvature is starting to attract more attention
from the machine learning community. It is such a fundamental property
of a manifold but can influence the validity of many calculations in
latent spaces. It also has some beneficial properties for <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BylEqnVFDB">graph
classification</a>, but this is
maybe a better topic for a subsequent post!</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10996">Graph Filtration Learning</a> by
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christoph_Hofer8">Christoph Hofer</a>,
<a href="https://www.uni-salzburg.at/index.php?id=213185&amp;L=1">Florian Graf</a>,
<a href="https://bastian.rieck.me/">Bastian Rieck</a>,
<a href="http://wwwx.cs.unc.edu/~mn/?q=content/overview">Marc Niethammer</a>, and
<a href="https://rkwitt.github.io/">Roland Kwitt</a> is arguably<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> the first step
towards properly integrating topological features into neural networks
for graph classification! Briefly put, we developed a homological
<code>READOUT</code> function&nbsp;(to use the parlance of graph neural networks)
that gives rise to a learnable filter function—a <em>filtration</em>.</p>
<p>This concept might be unknown to some readers, but a filtration in this
context is a scalar-valued function on the vertices of a graph that
permits <em>sorting</em> it. Filtrations serve as the backbone for many
topology-based algorithms, primarily for the aforementioned <a href="https://christian.bock.ml/posts/persistent_homology/">persistent homology</a>,
which permits us to study multi-scale topological
features&nbsp;(connected components, cycles, etc.) of an object.
Prior to this paper, filtrations were pre-defined or chosen based on
some target function, such as the vertex degree function of a graph. Our
approach changes this—leading to a filtration that is learnable in an
end-to-end fashion and thus specifically designed for a classification
problem.</p>
<p>We manage to achieve this by first initialising our filter function
based on a regular graph neural network; essentially, one level of
message passing between nodes is sufficient. This provides us with
a non-trivial filter function whose performance we can subsequently
adjust by calculating the topological features induced by said filter,
and vectorising the resulting representations. Since each of these steps
is differentiable<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, the resulting function is also differentiable,
making it possible to adjust the filter for the best classification
results.</p>
<p>I would recommend this paper to anyone who is interested in learning
more about the benefits that a topology-based perspective brings to
certain application problems. Being able to learn the <em>right</em> topological features
to classify a set of graphs opens up exciting opportunities.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04805">Topologically Densified Distributions</a>
by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christoph_Hofer8">Christoph Hofer</a>,
<a href="https://www.uni-salzburg.at/index.php?id=213185&amp;L=1">Florian Graf</a>,
<a href="http://wwwx.cs.unc.edu/~mn/?q=content/overview">Marc Niethammer</a>, and
<a href="https://rkwitt.github.io/">Roland Kwitt</a> studies regularisation properties of
over-parametrised neural networks in the context of small sample-size learning.
This is achieved by studying the properties of latent
representations&nbsp;(the paper uses the term <em>internal representation</em>,
but this is equivalent). More precisely, generalisation properties are
analysed via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushforward_measure">push-forward probability measure</a>
induced by the latent representation&nbsp;(or <em>encoding</em>).</p>
<p>The authors show that probability mass concentration around training
samples in the latent space is linked to the generalisation capabilities
of a model, but, even more exciting, such a concentration can be achieved by applying
topological constraints on samples from that space! In the context of
this paper, such constraints pertain to measuring the <em>connectivity</em> of
samples. This is achieved using <a href="https://christian.bock.ml/posts/persistent_homology/">persistent homology</a>, specifically,
by calculating a zero-dimensional Vietoris–Rips complex—if you are
not familiar with this term, just think of a minimum spanning tree.</p>
<p>What I particularly enjoyed about this paper is that it starts providing
solid answers to fundamental concepts in machine learning. All too often,
we remain in the realm of the empirical and just <em>observe</em> whether our
network generalises. This paper ventures into hitherto-unknown territories
and gives us a theoretical justification!</p>

<a href="https://bastian.rieck.me/">Bastian Rieck</a>, and
<a href="https://bsse.ethz.ch/mlcb/karsten.html">Karsten Borgwardt</a> deals with
regularising the latent space in terms of its topology. More precisely,
we preserve the topological features of the input data in the respective
latent space&nbsp;(on the batch level, respectively). While we restrict
our experiments to connected components for now&nbsp;(so no cycles
yet, even though our method generalises to higher dimensions),
our approach makes it possible to create latent representations
that ‘mimic’ the topological features of the input.</p>
<p>This leads to a nice plug-and-play loss term that can be easily
integrated into most architectures, and we can demonstrate that, among
others, it considerably improves the quality of a ‘vanilla’ autoencoder
architecture. To achieve this goal, we had to solve all kinds of
interesting adventures, one of them being how to make everything
differentiable. Interestingly, we end up with a similar necessary
condition for differentiability than for the graph filtration learning
paper, viz. the pairwise distances between different samples of the
input batch need to be <em>unique</em>.</p>
<p>The coolest feature of our method is that it technically <em>only</em> requires
a distance metric between input samples<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, nothing more—no feature
vector representation or anything. It can thus conceivably be used to
represent the topology of any object you fancy&nbsp;(including
documents, images, and graphs).</p>
<p>If you are interested in a beautifully-animated high-level introduction
to this publication, you should take the time to read Michael’s <a href="https://michaelmoor.ml/blog/topoae/main/">blog post on our paper</a>.</p>

<a href="https://web.mit.edu/physics/people/faculty/shanahan_phiala.html">Phiala E.  Shanahan</a>,
and <a href="http://theoryandpractice.org/">Kyle Cranmer</a>
present a novel method for calculating normalising flows on more complex
spaces than the usual Euclidean ones. Specifically, as the title
implies, they develop methods for calculating such flows on tori and
spheres.</p>
<p>What I enjoyed about this paper is the smart way of constructing flows
iteratively: first, flows on the circle are being constructed&nbsp;(using
different concepts for defining a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphism">diffeomorphism</a>, the most favourite of
mine being a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_transformation">Möbius transformation</a>).
Since a torus can be described as the Cartesian product of circles, this
is sufficient to describe flows on tori of arbitrary dimensions! Next,
the flows are generalised to higher-dimensional spheres.</p>
<p>While I am by no means and expert in normalising flows, I liked
reading this paper a lot. The theory is well-developed and it is another
one of those publications that shows you how to go beyond the boundaries
of what is currently possible. Moreover, I enjoyed the discussion of the
implementation details—it turns out that achieving numerical stability
here is another feat that deserves some mention!</p>

<p>This year’s ICML also featured an interesting array of topology-based
papers. Not all of them fit neatly into the field of topological data
analysis&nbsp;(TDA), but I am happy to see that the community is
starting to pick up this fundamental topic. I remain convinced that
a topology-driven perspective is needed to answer certain foundational
questions in machine learning. Here’s to the future of topology!</p>

September 1, 2020 | https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p><img src="https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/fight.jpeg" alt="Fish"></p>
<p>In the early 70s, C was created at Bell Labs as a byproduct of the development of UNIX.
It quickly became one of the most popular programming languages.
But it was not expressive enough for Bjarne Stroustrup.
And so, in 1983, as a byproduct of his Ph.D. thesis, he extended C.</p>
<p>C with classes was born.</p>
<p>At the time, Bjarne Stroustrup understood that a programming language has many components,
not only the language, its compiler, but also a linker and libraries.
Offering a familiar tool also makes adoption easier.
In this historical context, it makes sense that C++ would be based on C.</p>
<p>Fast-forward 40 years later.</p>
<p>Both C and C++ are widely used in the industry.
But go 5 minutes on the Internet and C developers will tell you that C++ is the most horrific man-made creation,
while many C++ developers wait for the day when C finally burns in the hot flames of hell.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-happened">So what happened?</h2>
<p>On the surface, C and C++ cater to the same use cases: high performance, deterministic, native but portable code for the widest range of hardware and applications.</p>
<p>But C is proudly a low-level language. A nicer assembly.</p>
<p>From day one, C++ had magic. Dark witchcraft: destructors. Suddenly the compiler was doing things on its own.
It also had type inference very early on, but the developers of the mid-80s were not quite ready for that and Bjarne Stroustrup
was pressured into removing <code>auto</code>, until it was added back to C++11.</p>
<p>From then, C++ got more and more tools to build abstractions.
I don’t think it would be fair to say that C++ is a low-level or high-level language. It’s both, by design.
But building high-level abstractions while not sacrificing performance is hard.
C++ then needed tools to achieve that: <code>constexpr</code>, move semantics, templates, and an ever-growing standard library.</p>
<p>Fundamentally I think C trusts developers while C++ trusts compilers.
This is a massive difference that sharing the same native types or syntax for while loop cannot hide.</p>
<p>C++ developers blame C for all their lost limbs, while C developers probably think C++ is batshit crazy.
I imagine that is a fair perspective if you look at C++ through a C lense. C++ is pretty wild <em>as a superset of C</em>.
A seasoned C person looking at C++ expecting familiarity in C++ will not find it. C++ is not C.
This is enough to feed flamewars for generations.</p>
<p>But as much as I dislike C, I don’t have any legitimacy to make fun of it. See, I have some experience with C++ but I
wrote very little C. It was probably bad C.
A language is also its good practices, patterns, idioms, and these take years to learn. If you try to write C code like it’s C++ or C++ like it is C, you will have a bad time.
Knowing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnWhqhNdYyk">C doesn’t teach you C++</a>. Knowing C++ does not teach you C.</p>
<p>So can we all stop saying C/C++, regret the unfortunate naming, and sing kumbaya in harmony?
Not so fast.</p>
<p>See, despite being philosophically different from C, C++ is still somewhat a superset of C.
That is to say, you can include a C header in a C++ translation unit and that should compile.
And this is where it gets messy.</p>
<p>C++ is not an extension of C.
It is designed as a separate standard, by a different committee, different people.
Logically, people who like C++'s philosophy will get involved in the C++ community and the C++ standardization process
while other people might try to get involved with C.
Committees, whether its C’s or C++'s, only manifest intent and direction through their respective end-product: the standards; standards which are the fruits of numerous voting.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is difficult for a compiler to know that it is dealing with a C header or a C++ header.</p>
<p><code>extern "C"</code> is not used consistently and only affects mangling, but neither grammar nor semantics.
And headers only exists in the eyes of the preprocessor, for a C++ compiler, everything is a C++ translation unit, and therefore C++.
And yet, people include C headers in C++ and expect it to “just work” ™️.
Which it mostly does.</p>
<p>We can wonder then,</p>
<h2 id="how-c-maintains-c-compatibility-while-being-developed-by-different-people-in-different-places">How C++ maintains C compatibility while being developed by different people in different places?</h2>
<p>Badly, I’m afraid.</p>
<p>A coworker recently reminded me of Conway’s law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By that logic, it would stand to reason that if the two committees don’t interoperate,
neither would the languages they produce.</p>
<p>C++ maintains a list of <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/diff.iso">incompatibilities with C</a> and <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/diff.library">its standard library</a>.
This list does not seem to reflect the many features that were added to C11 and C18 but are not valid C++ constructs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibility_of_C_and_C%2B%2B">Wikipedia</a> draws a clearer picture.</p>
<p>Listing incompatibilities isn’t sufficient to get a measure of incompatibilities between both languages.</p>
<p>Functions that exist in the C++ standard library but whose primary declaration is expected to come from C are difficult to make <code>constexpr</code>, and more difficult still to make <code>noexcept</code>.
C compatibility translates to performance costs and C functions are optimization barriers.</p>
<p>Many C constructs are valid C++ but should never pass a code review (<code>NULL</code>, <code>longjmp</code>, <code>malloc</code>, create/destroy functions, <code>free</code>, C  casts), etc.</p>
<p>These might not be bad C idioms, but they are bad C++. C++ has a stronger type system,
and unfortunately using C idioms punch a giant hole in that type system, and so C compatibility has a cost in terms of safety.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, C++ still care about C compatibility. Somewhat.
And interestingly C cares about C++. Somewhat.
Truth be told, C might care about C++ more than C++ cares about C.
So each committee cares somewhat about what the other does.
We care reluctantly.</p>
<p>See, C++ is aware of the many foundational libraries written in C, not only the <code>libc</code> but also <code>zip</code>, <code>png</code>, <code>curl</code>, <code>openssl</code> (!), and countless others, which are used in many, many C++ projects.
We can’t break that.</p>
<p>But recently, especially over the past decade, C++ has become much bigger than C.
C++ has more users - and a much more active community: <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2018/11/21/">There Are No C Conferences</a>.
Maybe that’s why the C++ committee is now over 10 times the size of the C committee.</p>
<p>C++ then is a force to be reckoned with and the C committee has to consider not breaking C++.
To the point that if a standard would track another, these days, C++ leads and C follow.</p>
<p>C++ is now on a steady three years cycle come rain or shine, or deadly pandemics.
Meanwhile, C has a major release every decade or so.
This makes sense. As a lower-level language, C doesn’t need to evolve as fast.</p>
<p>The C landscape is also rather different from the C++ landscape.
C caters to more platforms and a lot more compilers.
Everybody and their dog is writing C compilers because the language has a surface area small enough to make that possible, whereas the C++ committee will only really consider 4 implementations, all of which are represented at every meeting.
As a result, many features in C are implementation-defined or optionally supported so that the variety of compilers that exist can claim conformance without doing much work, which I’m told pleases regulatory bodies.</p>
<p>C++ these days is more interested in portability than implementation freedom. Yet another difference of philosophy.</p>
<h2 id="so-your-proposal-breaks-c-compatibility">So, your proposal breaks C compatibility</h2>
<p>Parts of my <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2178r1.pdf">P2178</a> paper theoretically affects C compatibility.
In such cases, none of the options seems satisfactory.</p>
<p>You could be told that you have to first get your feature into C. Which means more meetings.
Meetings you might not be able to attend because C has strict <a href="https://thephd.github.io/follow-the-river-wg14-ithaca-2019">attendance rules</a> - Excluding individuals not willing to put down thousands of dollars to become ISO members.
This is because the C committee is forced to adhere strictly to ISO rules.</p>
<p>It might also take a decade if the standard just shipped.
And most importantly, it might go nowhere if the C committee doesn’t understand or doesn’t care about the particular problem you are trying to solve.
And they probably don’t have the bandwidth to deal with it.
And you may not have the bandwidth to deal with C. After all, you joined C++ to improve C++.
In fact, if the room invites you to “talk to the C committee”, it is likely your proposal is dead, even in the unlikely event that no one in the room was against it.</p>
<p>Another likely scenario is that the C committee accepts a version of a proposal that is slightly different from what exists in C++.
<code>true</code>? Let’s make that a macro. <code>char16_t</code> ? Let’s make that a typedef. <code>char32_t</code>? Not necessarily UTF-32. <code>static_assert</code> ? <code>_Static_assert</code>.</p>
<p>The list goes on. Should we blame C? Probably not. Their committee does what they think is best for their language.
The opposite is true too. In C++20 designated initializers were inspired by C’s but are slightly different because they would otherwise not fit with the C++ initialization rules.</p>
<p>I am part of the problem. C has VLAs. I would vote against a proposal to adopt that in standard C++, <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Linux-Kills-The-VLA">too many security issues</a>. A proposal to add <code>_Generic</code> to C++ would be over-my-dead-body. I am not sure if <code>_Generic</code> attempts to palliate to the lack of template or the lack of overloads, but C++ has both these features - from my point of view <code>_Generic</code> doesn’t fit into the big picture of what I imagine C++ to be.</p>
<p>Both committees seem also inconsistent in how much they care about the other language.
Sometimes we go to great lenghts (<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/complex">std::complex</a>), sometimes we don’t care at all (<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/array">static array parameters</a>).</p>
<p>There is no way around this. Don’t forget that each committee is a bunch of people
voting at different times in different rooms and trying to control the outcome would defeat the purpose
of having a vote.
Putting people in the same room is not realistic either. ISO might object and the participation inbalance
would put C people at an enormous disadvantage.</p>
<h2 id="c-compatibility-doesnt-matter-kinda">C compatibility doesn’t matter, kinda</h2>
<p>If you are a C developer, I imagine you see C as a neat programming language.
But for the rest of us, C is something else.</p>
<p>C is the universal, cross-language glue that ties it all together.</p>
<p>For C++ users, C is …</p></div></div>

<p>This is an exploratory post of what extensible unions (a.k.a. polymorphic variants) might look like in Elm. This mainly a post to plant a seed in the minds of the collective Elm community and is not a call to action that they need to be implemented in Elm (although I would really really really love if they were).</p>
<p>One-line headline: I think extensible unions not only fill in a missing abstract corner of Elm’s type system (rather than being a entirely novel extension to its type system), but also solve many real-world problems affecting Elm codebases today, all without compromising and indeed augmenting the Elm compiler’s excellent way of guiding users through refactors.</p>
<p>This post is jumping off a separate post <a href="https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/how-to-represent-many-subsets-of-an-enum/6088/22">here</a> with some folks who were interested in a deeper explanation of extensible unions/polymorphic variants.</p>
<p>This post ended up being <strong>really</strong> long, so I apologize for its length in advance, but I do hope that people find it useful.</p>
<p>Because of its length I’ll just lead off with a high-level summary.</p>
<p>Polymorphic variants or extensible union types are to normal Elm union types (e.g.&nbsp;<code>type MyUnionType = UnionVariant0 | UnionVariant1 | UnionVariant2</code>) what records and extensible records are to normal Elm product types (e.g.&nbsp;<code>type MyProductType = ProductType TypeOfElement0 TypeOfElement1 TypeOfElement2</code>).</p>
<p>As such they allow for many of the same benefits that records and extensible records bring to input types of functions and modularizing Elm models, to output types of functions and modularizing Elm messages and update functions.</p>
<p>This post is split up into the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#what-are-extensible-union-types">What are extensible union types</a>: A introduction to some pseudo-Elm to help familiarize people with what extensible unions are. If you already know what extensible unions/polymorphic variants are you can skip this. <strong>The crucial take away is that we already have the equivalent of extensible unions for products, i.e.&nbsp;extensible records. This is just filling in a hole for current union types.</strong></li>
<li><a href="#what-are-the-benefits-of-extensible-unions">What are the benefits of extensible unions (the basics)</a>: Walking through some basic, contrived cases where extensible unions can come in handy.</li>
<li><a href="#everyday-elm-cases">Everyday Elm cases</a>: A non-exhaustive list of case studies of where extensible unions can help in code you’re likely to see in real Elm codebases.
<ul>
<li>Reminding you when you forget certain output cases for decoding</li>
<li>Unifying different error types</li>
<li>Modular Elm code: Unifying NoMap, OutMsg, and Translator</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="#drawbacks">Drawbacks and things-you-might-think-are-drawbacks-but-aren’t (a.k.a. literature review of other implementations)</a>: A dive into some cons and not-really-cons of extensible unions as well as how they’re implemented in other languages (mainly OCaml).</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s begin with a very short primer on union (a.k.a. sum types) and product types. We’ll approach them individually even though in Elm we can mix and match them together in a single type declaration. This hopefully will make some of the later presentation of extensible union types a little easier to follow.</p>
<p>Union types are those types that express an “or” relationship among its type constructors.</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a><span>-- MyColor is Red *or* Green *or* Blue</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2"></a><span>type</span> <span>MyColor</span> <span>=</span> <span>Red</span> <span>|</span> <span>Green</span> <span>|</span> <span>Blue</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Product types are those types that express an “and” relationship in its (single) type constructor.</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>-- MyUserType is a MyUser that consists of a String *and* another String (maybe</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a><span>-- a first and last name)</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3"></a><span>type</span> <span>MyUserType</span> <span>=</span> <span>MyUser</span> <span>String</span> <span>String</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>These two kinds of types are dual, i.e.&nbsp;complements, to one another, where you’ll see each of them playing “opposite” roles in a lot of circumstances. We’ve already seen one example here, whereas a union type can have multiple type constructors, only one of which can be used at any given time for a single value (i.e.&nbsp;only one of <code>Red</code>, <code>Green</code>, or <code>Blue</code> can be in use for a single value of type <code>MyColor</code>), a product type has a single constructor with multiple fields, all of which must be filled in for a single value (for any value of <code>MyUserType</code> both strings must be provided to <code>MyUser</code>). Notice the inverted relationship between multiple and single between the two (i.e. multiple type constructors vs single type constructor and single variant in use vs multiple fields must all be filled in). This sort of “dual” inversion will show up a lot more later on.</p>
<p>Even though the two are complements to one another, statically typed programming languages in general seem to favor product types over union types. You see this with languages like Java that allow for the creation of product types (i.e.&nbsp;Java classes), but have no union types. Statically typed FP languages such as Elm address this imbalance by also allowing union types. This unlocks a host of data modeling goodies and is the core of how Elm allows us to create “correct by construction” models that make errors unrepresentable.</p>
<p>Elm, however, goes further than some other statically typed FP languages and bestows more power to product types through record types and extensible record types. These essentially are product types on steroids. To see that records are fundamentally product types, note that you could in theory replace every record type with a product type, it’d just make for really annoying code because all of a sudden your fields are all anonymous and position-based.</p>
<p>However, Elm, in a fashion that somewhat echoes Java’s choice to disadvantage union types, doesn’t provide equivalent power to union types. The rest of this post is an exploration in what that might look like if Elm did.</p>
<p>To understand the relationship between extensible union types and normal union types, it’s perhaps illuminating to first consider the relationship between record types and normal product types.</p>
<p>Notice that Elm records differ from Elm’s normal product types by being</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Structural: Normal product types in Elm are nominal, that is name-based. Every product type you use must have been declared somewhere and is given an explicit, unique name that is used for typechecking. On the other hand record types are anonymous. Though they can be given a name with <code>type alias</code> that name is non-canonical (the same record type can be given multiple different names) and plays no role in typechecking. In other words <em>the structure of a record type is all that matters to the type checker, not its name.</em></li>
<li>Extensible: Normal product type signatures must specify all possible fields it supports. Extensible records only need to specify a subset of fields and then leave the others unspecified.</li>
</ol>
<p>Just to make this clear, here are the three versions of a product type that Elm supports at the current moment.</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a><span>-- Normal Elm product type</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2"></a><span>type</span> <span>SomeProductType</span> <span>=</span> <span>ProductTypeConstructor</span> <span>Int</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb3-4"><a href="#cb3-4"></a><span>-- Normal Elm record, notice the type alias rather than type</span></span>
<span id="cb3-5"><a href="#cb3-5"></a><span>type</span> <span>alias</span> <span>SomeRecord</span> <span>=</span> { <span>field0</span> : <span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>field1</span> : <span>String</span> }</span>
<span id="cb3-6"><a href="#cb3-6"></a></span>
<span id="cb3-7"><a href="#cb3-7"></a><span>-- Extensible Elm record, notice the type variable</span></span>
<span id="cb3-8"><a href="#cb3-8"></a><span>type</span> <span>alias</span> <span>ExtensibleRecord</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> { <span>a</span> <span>|</span> <span>field0</span> : <span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>field1</span> : <span>String</span> }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Extensible union types introduce these two features, namely making a type structural and extensible, to union types. I find actual code to often be hepful here, so I’m going to introduce some hypothetical Elm syntax here.</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a><span>-- Normal Elm sum type</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2"></a><span>type</span> <span>User0</span> <span>=</span> <span>RegularUser</span> <span>Int</span> <span>|</span> <span>AdminUser</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a href="#cb4-4"></a><span>-- Hypothetical extensible union type, again note that this is a type alias</span></span>
<span id="cb4-5"><a href="#cb4-5"></a><span>type</span> <span>alias</span> <span>User1</span> <span>=</span> <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>Int</span> <span>or</span> <span>@</span><span>AdminUser</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb4-6"><a href="#cb4-6"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-7"><a href="#cb4-7"></a><span>-- Hypothetical extensible union type actually using the extensible portion,</span></span>
<span id="cb4-8"><a href="#cb4-8"></a><span>-- note the type variable</span></span>
<span id="cb4-9"><a href="#cb4-9"></a><span>type</span> <span>alias</span> <span>User2</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span> <span>or</span> <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>Int</span> <span>or</span> <span>@</span><span>AdminUser</span> <span>String</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s go over <code>User1</code> and <code>User2</code> in more detail. Names prefixed with a an <code>@</code> symbol such as <code>@RegularUser</code> are extensible union tags. These play an analogous role to field names in a record type. That is <code>@RegularUser Int</code> is an independent type in the same way <code>{ field0 : Int }</code> is an independent type, rather than just a value like <code>RegularUser Int</code>.</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1"></a><span>@</span><span>SomeVariantTag</span> <span>MyType</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2"></a><span>^</span> <span>tag</span> <span>name</span>      <span>^</span> <span>tagged</span> <span>type</span></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb5-4"><a href="#cb5-4"></a>{ <span>recordField</span> : <span>MyType</span> }</span>
<span id="cb5-5"><a href="#cb5-5"></a>  <span>^</span> <span>tag</span> <span>name</span>    <span>^</span> <span>tagged</span> <span>type</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Likewise, just like record field names can be used as the value level to directly create a value, extensible union tags can be used at the value level to directly create a value.</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1"></a><span>someRegularUser</span> : <span>User1</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2"></a><span>-- Equivalently</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3"><a href="#cb6-3"></a><span>-- someRegularUser : @RegularUser Int or @AdminUser String</span></span>
<span id="cb6-4"><a href="#cb6-4"></a><span>-- or</span></span>
<span id="cb6-5"><a href="#cb6-5"></a><span>-- someRegularUser : @AdminUser String or @RegularUser Int</span></span>
<span id="cb6-6"><a href="#cb6-6"></a><span>-- Notice just like for record fields the order doesn't matter</span></span>
<span id="cb6-7"><a href="#cb6-7"></a><span>-- This is different from a normal sum type where Result String Int is</span></span>
<span id="cb6-8"><a href="#cb6-8"></a><span>-- different from Result Int String</span></span>
<span id="cb6-9"><a href="#cb6-9"></a><span>someRegularUser</span> <span>=</span> <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>0</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we could also have assigned this type</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1"></a><span>someOtherRegularUser</span> : <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2"></a><span>someOtherRegularUser</span> <span>=</span> <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>0</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>or</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1"></a><span>lotsOfIrrelevantVariants</span> : <span>@</span><span>Blah</span> <span>String</span> <span>or</span> <span>@</span><span>Blahblah</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>or</span> <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2"><a href="#cb8-2"></a><span>lotsOfIrrelevantVariants</span> <span>=</span> <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>0</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>For now let’s leave aside why all these type signatures work other than to hand-wave it and say they all make sense if you think of “or”. We’ll return to that in just a bit when we look close at extensible types. Instead, let’s look at how to actually work with extensible unions.</p>
<p>Fundamentally the only thing you can do with a product type is pull out its fields. On the flip side, fundamentally the only thing you can do with a union type is pattern match on its variants with a case statement.</p>
<p>This remains true for extensible unions, which have their own associated case statement for pattern matching on them, introduced by <code>case#</code> instead of <code>case</code> (you could unify them as a single <code>case</code> statement, but I’m separating them for clarity here).</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1"></a><span>toInt</span> : <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>Int</span> <span>or</span> <span>@</span><span>AdminUser</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2"><a href="#cb9-2"></a><span>toInt</span> <span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>case</span><span>#</span> <span>user</span> <span>of</span></span>
