November 22, 2020 | https://boxbase.org/entries/2020/nov/22/plan9-port-kapow/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://boxbase.org/entries/2020/nov/22/plan9-port-kapow/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>I have mentioned that applications duplicate operating system's functionality.
How severe issue is it and what kind of consequences there are?</p>
<p><a href="https://gottcode.org/kapow/">Kapow punch clock</a> tracks hours and constructs reports.
Its author has done well in maintaining complexity.
The whole program is only 4171 lines (+594 lines of copyright headers),
with total 146kB of source code.
This post presents a program for Plan 9 that serves the same purpose.
Finally lets do some comparison.</p>
<p><img alt="kapow screenshot" src="https://boxbase.org/entries/2020/nov/22/plan9-port-kapow/kapow.png"></p>
<p>The source code presented is attached: <a href="https://boxbase.org/entries/2020/nov/22/plan9-port-kapow/task.zip">task.zip</a></p>
<h2>task entries</h2>
<p>The clock has this kind of a nice directory -tab.
I have seen this tool being used.
The tabs were used to track customer_project_day instead of projects.
The dialog looks like a file browser.</p>
<p>The 'task' program treats each task as a file.
For instance here's the '0.kapow.task'.</p>
<pre><code>Punch clock port experiment
</code><code>start: Sat Nov 21 11:00:06 GMT 2020</code></pre>
<p>This is a running task.
When I'm done, I append in the stop: -line.</p>
<p>The time stamps aren't using Finnish abbreviations for weekdays or months
and it is bit inconvenient for me.
Though they are slightly more convenient than unix timestamps
because I can type the hour there if I forget to mark it.</p>
<p>The system benefits from not needing a locale to parse dates.
If you don't like english dates, you can use ISO-8601 timestamps,
those should work as well and look like this:</p>
<pre><code>2020-11-21T20:16:49+00:00</code></pre>
<h2>task/start and task/stop</h2>
<p>To start a task you write a timestamp into a file and mark it to start the task.
Although it'd be easy to do it manually,
I add few convenience scripts so you don't lose an entry
just because you write &gt; instead of &gt;&gt;.
Here's task/start and task/stop.
They are used to mark a task completed or start a task.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/rc
</code><code>rfork e
</code><code>for (taskname in $*) { echo start: `{date} &gt;&gt; $taskname }
</code><code>
</code><code>#!/bin/rc
</code><code>rfork e
</code><code>for (taskname in $*) { echo stop: `{date} &gt;&gt; $taskname }</code></pre>
<p>You can consider these are up to you to configure,
they're for your convenience.</p>
<h2>task/span</h2>
<p>Next you need a tool to know task status. Here's the 'task/span':</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/rc
</code><code>if (~ $#* 1) {
</code><code>  if (test -f $1) {
</code><code>    rfork e
</code><code>    taskname=$1
</code><code>    start=`{sed -n 's/^start: (.*)$/\1/p' &lt;$taskname | xargs seconds}
</code><code>    stop=`{sed -n 's/^stop: (.*)$/\1/p' &lt;$taskname | xargs seconds}
</code><code>    if (~ $stop '') stop=`{date | xargs seconds}
</code><code>
</code><code>    dt=`{echo print $stop(1) - $start(1) | bc}
</code><code>    s=`{echo print $dt % 60 | bc}
</code><code>    m=`{echo print $dt / 60 % 60 | bc}
</code><code>    h=`{echo print $dt / 3600 | bc}
</code><code>    echo span: $h hours $m minutes $s seconds
</code><code>    }
</code><code>  if not { echo not a file: $1&gt;[1=2]; exit usage }
</code><code>  }
</code><code>if not { echo usage: $0 taskfile &gt;[1=2]; exit usage }</code></pre>
<p>It presents how many hours, minutes, seconds have been spent in the task.
If the task is still running, it uses the current time as range.</p>
<h2>task/report</h2>
<p>The 'task/report' sorts the tasks and builds a report out of them.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/rc
</code><code>rfork e
</code><code>tasks=`{for (t in $*) {
</code><code>  p=`{sed -n 's/^start: (.*)$/\1/p' $t | xargs seconds}
</code><code>  echo $p $t } | sort -n | awk '{ print $2 }'}
</code><code>
</code><code>for(taskname in $tasks) {
</code><code>  span=`{task/span $taskname | awk '{ print $2,$3,$4,$5 }'}
</code><code>  start=`{sed -n 's/^start: (.*)$/(\1)/p' $taskname}
</code><code>  stop=`{sed -n 's/^stop: (.*)$/(\1)/p' $taskname}
</code><code>  if (~ $stop '') { echo $span $start '*' }
</code><code>  if not { echo $span $start }
</code><code>  sed '/^start:|^stop:/d' $taskname | sed 's/^/  /g'
</code><code>  }
</code><code>
</code><code>total=0
</code><code>for(taskname in $tasks) {
</code><code>  d=`{task/span $taskname | awk '{ print $2,$4 }'}
</code><code>  total=`{echo print $total + ($d(1) '*' 60) + $d(2) | bc}
</code><code>}
</code><code>echo total: `{echo print $total / 60 | bc} hours `{echo print $total % 60 | bc} minutes</code></pre>
<p>When a task is ongoing, this utility shows a star on it's entry.
This script could be customized for different uses.
Right now it's a plaintext report.</p>
<h2>display</h2>
<p>Some people like to have a display that tracks what is going on.
The 'task/track' -script executes a command periodically every minute
and the window where it runs is cleaned every time it repeats.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/rc
</code><code>task/report `{rc -c $"*} &gt;/dev/text
</code><code>while (sleep 60) task/report `{rc -c $"*} &gt; /dev/text</code></pre>
<p>It again is merely a convenience.
All of this functionality composes with rest of what the system has to offer.
For instance if you want to see all tasks in some directory:</p>
<pre><code>while (sleep 1) {
</code><code>    echo -n &gt;/dev/text
</code><code>    for (x in *.task) {
</code><code>        echo -n $x: ' '
</code><code>        task/span $x }}</code></pre>
<p>Also here's a cool thing,
if you want completed task list to appear when you log into your terminal,
you can add this into the rio start script:</p>
<pre><code>window -r 2338 15 2853 345 task/track 'echo *.task'</code></pre>
<p>Ok, we're done now. Here's how the finished program looks like:</p>
<p><img alt="task screenshot" src="https://boxbase.org/entries/2020/nov/22/plan9-port-kapow/task.png"></p>
<h2>tally</h2>
<p>The whole program suite is 48 lines and 1.5kB.</p>
<pre><code>cpu% wc bin/rc/task/*
</code><code> 21     119     703 bin/rc/task/report
</code><code> 18     100     578 bin/rc/task/span
</code><code>  3      11      73 bin/rc/task/start
</code><code>  3      11      72 bin/rc/task/stop
</code><code>  3      15     100 bin/rc/task/track
</code><code> 48     256    1526 total</code></pre>
<p>This is about 85 times less than kapow punch clock.</p>
<h2>apples and oranges?</h2>
<p>It may seem the comparison is unfair.
Are the programs equivalent in functionality?
The answer is no.
The 'task' implements much less functionality than the kapow punch clock.
It's barely considered bunch of scripts.
However the tasks are merely files and you edit them with existing tools,
this thing introduces very little to learn.
The manual is 1kB and I think I made it verbose.
Yet despite that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You're able to search from your tasks.</li>
<li>Exporting/Importing of tasks is easy because they are files
and to use the program you have to know where they are.</li>
<li>Tasks can be interleaved with other contents on the system.</li>
<li>Tasks archive properly given your other files archive properly.</li>
<li>You can attach and receive tasks in the mail.</li>
<li>The status of the tasklist can be securely live-displayed
on a remote info board and shared with collaborators.</li>
<li>There are lots of customization options.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do wonder what the take-away from here is.
Despite this all, kapow punch clock, it's fine software.
I don't mind that it's been written.</p>
<h2>experiences</h2>
<p>I did this to try off this 'rc' and try to write a manual page.
I'm surprised how usable the 'troff' is once you don't assume it should be something familiar.
The 'rc' is equally incredible by having an actual structure that you can rely on.
Plan 9 is such an incredibly good operating system,
I constantly find things that surprise in a good way.</p>

<p>I would download and save assets, bookmark libraries, save articles and tutorials. Anything that could help me with doing a better job.</p>
<p>I thought I was being resourceful, but I think it came from a place of fear. I wasn’t confident in my skills and would collect anything that might help compensate for that. I don’t think it did.</p>
<p>I don’t remember a single time when was able to solve a problem at work by digging into my collection of resources.</p>
<p>What did help was building things and getting more practice under my belt. Every time I solved a new problem, it gave me a mental model to approach a category of similar problems. (See also: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_matching">pattern matching</a>)</p>
<p>The more I practiced, the better I got at pattern matching. And more importantly, I grew more confident in my ability to solve new problems that I haven’t come across yet.</p>
<p>Now with a few years under my belt, I’ve <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuZeff2y32M">declared bankruptcy</a> on my reading list and open tabs. I still read a lot, I just don’t read an article that isn’t relevant to the work I’m doing right now, and I most definitely don’t save it for later.</p>

<p>Know less, do more.</p>

What seems like productive reading time in the morning reverted back to mindless commutes between work and home. I can relate and in november, this is my attempt to get back to my reading habits every single day.</p>

<p>Back in my previous article <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://blog.phuaxueyong.com/post/2020-07-20-articles-of-july/">Want to improve?

<p>For all developers whom are looking for direct alternatives to google’s tools. it is interesting to see the extent of inconvenience this community of non-googlers would go just not to use google. Privacy definitely has its importance; all the more paramount when its used in your disfavour.</p>

<p>The more time you spent building your product, your own furniture, or even your software will create this irrational love for it. Some call it the ikea effect where furnitures build by your own hands seems to have more worth than it actually has - an addition of sentimental worth.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s often effort that ultimately creates long-term satisfaction,” wrote Dan Ariely wrote in his book&nbsp;The Upside of Irrationality, after co-authoring the Ikea effect paper. “Greater labor leads to greater love.”</p>

<p>While it is not entirely true, there are some good pointers to take away from this article. Coincidentally, I agree with point 2,4,6,8,10. A good design makes a product understandable. The design is supposed to make the product self explanatory. The classical example is how a 3 year old was able to understand how to use an iphone without any manual or explanation. That is a ton of genius packed into one small device.</p>

<p>It is interesting how things that we take for granted are actually a solution to challenging problems that were faced by the previous generations. While it is a story back into history, here is a quote from John E. Warnock, the cofounder of Adobe.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>“What industries badly need is a universal way to communicate documents across a wide variety of machine configurations, operating systems and communication networks. These documents should be viewable on any display and should be printable on any modern printers. If this problem can be solved, then the fundamental way people work will change.”  — John E. Warnock, the cofounder of Adobe</p>

While Apple is talking about saving the earth by producing less electronic waste, I would hope to see how they are backing up their attempts with statistics.

<p>Rather than to fight the slow fight to convince others to drive less and thus have less cars on the road, how about a radical alternative?</p>

<p>Give them an pleasant alternative, escooters. This can help to cover short distance travels, it also help us to see how the government can chart the way for a societal change in lifestyle. A step forward for countries to reduce in carbon footprint is to create bicycle lanes to encourage more bicycle as preferred mode of transport.</p>

<p>Give them space and time to work, free from distractions. Work from home’s top distractions are actually the consistent messages that keeps coming in while being physically around your coworkers.</p>

<p>Work from home allows you the socially acceptable approach to mute your employees so you can focus on the tasks before you. While WFH heightens the room for productivity, people are feeling more lonely than before.</p>

<p>The disconnection with their coworkers can also affect their productivity as their mental wellness can be affected with prolong isolation. Companies however feels that it is personal employee responsibility to get themselves connected. Essentially, while it is true to a large extent, companies can play its part to setup itself up for success; not by luck but by design. This includes digital engagements, interactive digital townhall, more frequent get togethers once in a while to bring people together.</p>

<p>The two LBs route requests based on different critierias across the different layers of OSI layer. Network assumes availability as long as there is a successful TCP ping to the resource; regardless of the content of the pong response. App LB allows you to validate the content of the response to be correct.</p>

<p>Very good short snippet to understand the different use-cases.</p>

<p>It is your experiences and achievements that shows how good a programmer you are. Flush those out. Don’t go flashing your education status when that truthfully does not reflect the strength of a programmer. You can be book smart but not a good programmer with a long history of writing bad code. Get that sorted out.</p>

<p>The secret to serving static video content is to use CDNs.<br>
<a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/CDN.html">This</a> is a simple description of what is a CDN. This might be my an interesting topic to delve deeper to explore the science behind this magic.</p>

<p>Some of the CDNs includes Limelight, Level 3, Akamai, CloudFront, and CloudFlare. For Netflix, they created their own CDN call <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://openconnect.netflix.com/en/">Open Connect</a>. This is definitely another tool to explore.</p>

<p>Here’s an overview of how Netflix uses the client to determine the *best CDN to use:</p>
<ul>
<li>The API signals that the content this person is trying to watch is on, say, 10 different CDN servers.</li>
<li>The client intelligence picks the CDN that it calculates to be best*</li>
<li>The client intelligence continually probes to find the best way of receiving content</li>

A short glimpse into what pet vs cattle systems are. The definitions based on the post has accurately described them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pets</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Servers or server pairs that are treated as indispensable or unique systems that can never be down. Typically they are manually built, managed, and “hand fed”. Examples include mainframes, solitary servers, HA loadbalancers/firewalls (active/active or active/passive), database systems designed as master/slave (active/passive), and so on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cattle</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Arrays of more than two servers, that are built using automated tools, and are designed for failure, where no one, two, or even three servers are irreplaceable. Typically, during failure events no human intervention is required as the array exhibits attributes of “routing around failures” by restarting failed servers or replicating data through strategies like triple replication or erasure coding. Examples include web server arrays, multi-master datastores such as Cassandra clusters, multiple racks of gear put together in clusters, and just about anything that is load-balanced and multi-master.\</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They can go down whenever, however. But they are always creating new server applications to ensure that the service is online.</p>

<h2>TLDR;</h2>

<p>Reading has this compounding effect with tangible effects budding months or even years of consistent practice. In technology, while it is easy to just chase the work and code, one of the most fundamental habits of x10 engineers is the habit of reading and immersing themselves in tech talks and discussions. May us all engineers develop this habit and make the world a better place; one piece of code at a time.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You've validated your micro-SaaS idea and are ready to start building the product.</p><p>The obvious next questions are</p><ol start="" role="list"><li>Which features should the product include in its first version?</li><li>How long should you take to build it?</li></ol><p>Through this post, I provide you with a framework to identify your initial product features, how to decide what to include or exclude from the first versions, and continue building upon it.</p><p>Before jumping into MLP, let's first understand what MVP&nbsp;is and why it's not enough in today's times.</p><h2>What is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)?</h2><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ericries" target="_blank">Eric Ries</a> popularized the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product" target="_blank">minimum viable product</a> in his book <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/" target="_blank">The Lean Startup</a> as that version of a new product that is just usable enough by early customers who can then provide feedback to the team. This feedback should help the team generate validated learnings and guide them on future product development and features.</p><h4>When MVP still works</h4><p>MVP is not dead though. It still works, given the right kind of problem statements.</p><p>Suppose you're building something that simply doesn't exist in the world, and it's something that people really want and have no alternative to getting it except from you.</p><p>At this time, people will accept a textbook MVP, simply because they have no frame of reference to compare it with. Or better yet, because they have no alternative to replace your MVP with.</p><h4>Why MVP&nbsp;is not enough in 2021</h4><p>Over the past few years as smartphone penetration boomed, products matured, product design and user experience matured, people's expectations have increased.</p><p>No longer does a quickly thrown together prototype cut it. People expect a minimum level of good UX and ease-of-use, else they'll leave your app before even giving it a proper try.</p><p>In fact, in 2021 great UX might be one strong reason people pick your product over incumbents. That's what happened with <a href="https://transistor.fm/" target="_blank">Transistor.fm</a>, who made podcast hosting simple and easy.</p><p>People expect good aesthetics that make a first impression, simply because that's what they have become used to from the plethora of beautiful and well-designed apps out there in the world.</p><p>People expect products to be fully functional as advertised. Buggy products are not acceptable, and in fact people might quickly take to Twitter or social media to let others know that a product is unreliable.</p><p>The MVP mindset intensely focuses on building the bare minimum, and that often leaves users frustrated and drives them to seek alternative solutions. Stiffer competition means that people WILL compare your product to alternatives in the market, it's inevitable. And unless you provide something unique and valuable that nobody else does, people are likely to leave.</p><p>All these reasons and more make MVP&nbsp;a dated concept, especially in the context of SaaS products. But above all, I think the MVP mindset makes product builders think too heavily about the "minimum" and often so at the cost of "viable".</p><p>That's a common pitfall and to avoid that, I propose the MLP framework.</p><h2>What is a Minimum Loveable Product (MLP)?</h2><p>A great new concept that I've fallen in love with and personally follow in every product I build is MLP, or Minimum Loveable Product.</p><p>The term MLP was first coined by Brian de Haaff, the co-founder of Aha!, in his book <a href="https://www.aha.io/lovability" target="_blank">Lovability</a>.</p><p>Its definition is an extension of what Eric Ries already introduced to the world with MVP. With MLP though, you are trying to build the minimum "loveable" product, with a focus on no matter how small or feature-stripped the first version of your product is, it is sufficient to deliver a delightful experience to your user.</p><h4>Minimum Viable Product and the burnt pizza analogy</h4><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiaona/" target="_blank">Jiaona Zhang</a>, who is currently VP&nbsp;of Product at Webflow (this blog is built using Webflow) introduced the <a href="https://firstround.com/review/dont-serve-burnt-pizza-and-other-lessons-in-building-minimum-lovable-products/" target="_blank">burnt pizza analogy</a> to her students at Stanford.</p><p>“<em>Say you’re trying to test whether people like pizza. If you serve them burnt pizza, you’re not getting feedback on whether they like pizza. You only know that they don’t like burnt pizza. Similarly, when you’re only relying on the MVP, the fastest and cheapest functional prototype, you risk not actually testing your product, but rather a poor or flawed version of it.</em>"</p><p>A great practical example of Minimum Loveable Product is the Apple iPad. All the tablets that came before Apple's tablet were MVPs.</p><h2>MLP vs MVP</h2><p>If you're new to all these terminologies, I understand that it can be confusing. Bear with me, you'll wrap your head around it soon enough.</p><p>Build an MLP when you are solving a problem that's already understood by people, and an MVP when people don't easily understand a problem.</p><p>Build an MLP when you can clearly define and understand a market and you are trying to stand out from the existing tools. Build an MVP when you're trying to gauge if there even exists a market to serve.</p><p>An&nbsp;MLP can be built when you know exactly what customers want. An MVP is when you don't know what customers want, and therefore you want to throw things at the wall as quickly as possible and see what sticks.</p><p>An MLP is necessary if you are building in a market where several large and well-known alternatives already exist. An MVP is the right approach for a new market with barely any alternatives, or those solutions are not yet known by the masses.</p><p>While building an MLP, you make a dedicated effort to succeed with that idea. With MVP, you are trying to determine quickly whether the idea can succeed or whether it will fail.</p><p>Building an&nbsp;MVP means you're ready for failure and also ready to pivot quickly as you learn more about the market. Which means you should make tech and architecture decisions that help you move fast above anything else. Scalability or good architecture design is a concern to pay attention to while building an MLP.</p><p>Finally, the end goal of an MLP is that the customers who use it find it sufficient in functionality and experience to be able to "love" it. With an MLP, you're building just enough that a customer with (hopefully) a real pain point would "tolerate" and continue using your product while you validate your assumptions.</p><h2>Minimum Marketable Product, Minimum Remarkable Product, Minimum Launchable Product</h2><p>The what?</p><p>I know, I know. I came across these terms for the first time today while researching to write this post. And I went through the literature so that I can tell you to safely ignore it.</p><p>If you understand and embody the concept of MLP, you don't need to think about any other frameworks or terminologies that you may discover while researching on Google.</p><h2>How to build an MLP for your Micro SaaS idea</h2><p>Alright, let's put aside theory and dive right in.</p><p>Here are the steps you should loosely follow to building an MLP.</p><h4>1. Understand the #1 problem you're trying to solve</h4><p>What's the #1 reason someone would want to use your Micro SaaS product over existing alternatives?</p><p>Is it that existing options have poor UX?&nbsp;Great, create a well designed and easy-to-use product. You'd be surprised to know how often people switch to an easier to use tool, simply because they are fed up of the poor UX that they encounter repeatedly.</p><p>Is it that existing alternatives are very expensive?&nbsp;Carve out a minimum set of features that people are paying a lot of money for and charge 1/10th for your v1 product. This might not work for very large customers, but vast majority of customers who are small or mid-sized are always looking for affordable alternatives.</p><p>It might not just be raw quantum of pricing, but certain companies targeting Enterprise customers have very complicated pricing slabs and tiers that are designed to give their sales person more room. In such a case, coming out with a competitor product which has a simple, easy-to-understand pricing is how you attract customers.</p><p>Are existing alternatives lacking certain features that leaves a subset of users very dissatisfied?&nbsp;Great, your MLP should specifically address that problem by building functionality that attracts these dissatisfied users. Side note - This is perhaps one of the best ways to go about building a new product.</p><p>In all cases, it involves understanding the problem you are solving and the exact reason why someone would use your product.</p><h4>2. Design a simple product that solves the top customer needs satisfactorily</h4><p>Once you have identified the #1 reason, it's time to decide on a feature set for your product that solves your customer's top pain points satisfactorily.</p><p><strong>Let's take an example</strong> - People want to add a feedback tracking tool inside their product, so that they can collect user feedback automatically. However, the existing solutions don't allow them to embed the feedback tracker within their tool.</p><p>That's your entry point into providing value that customers seek, but are not getting as of today.</p><p>Having understood the #1 problem, you also have to understand other requirements that fall under the "minimum" set of things you need to do to build a "loveable" product.</p><p>These could be:</p><ul role="list"><li>existing solutions are all well designed and aesthetically pleasing =&gt;&nbsp;your minimum loveable product needs to be well designed too</li><li>existing solutions are affordably priced with a easy to understand pricing structure =&gt; your MLP also needs a simple pricing structure that's affordable</li></ul><p>In general, you want to analyze your competitors and understand </p><ol start="" role="list"><li>What they are doing well</li><li>What users value from among those things</li></ol><p>In your MLP, you need to cover the intersection of (what they are doing well) x (what users value from among those).</p><h4>3. Set a short timeline for building your MLP</h4><p>No matter what you build, building in isolation for too long is dangerous. The main reason for that is - you get to know too late whether your assumptions about what the user really values are on point or off course.</p><p><strong>"But Preetam, you just told me to build a Minimum Loveable Product. And now you're saying I got to build it quickly?"</strong></p><p>Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.</p><p>Short timeframe depends on what you are building, and the size of your team.</p><p>For example - with SuperLemon (WhatsApp plugin for Shopify), Sankalp and I built a MLP in 2 weeks time.</p><p>How?</p><p>We identified precisely the way we could do better - …</p></div></div>

<h2>C++ Vector</h2>
<p>A <b>vector</b> is a sequence container implementing array that can change in size. Unlike array, the size of a vector changes automatically when elements are appended or deleted. </p>
<p>Vector stores elements in contiguous memory location which enables direct access of any elements using <span>operator []</span>. To support shrink and expand functionality at runtime, vector container may allocate some extra storage. Hence, compared to array, vector requires more memory and in return it manage memory dynamically and efficiently.</p>

</a></p><p>By John Lekberg on November 21, 2020.
</p><hr>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25174048">Hacker News discussion.</a></p>
<hr>
<p>This week's post is about Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html">bisect</a> module. You will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_binning">Statistical data binning</a> with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.bisect">bisect.bisect</a>.</li>
<li>Adding new data to a sorted list with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.insort">bisect.insort</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html">bisect</a> module is to allow you to efficiently search and
update sorted lists. To this end, it provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">binary search</a> implementation, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.bisect">bisect.bisect</a>.</li>
<li>An "insert" -- as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort">insertion sort</a> -- implementation, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.insort">bisect.insort</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_binning">statistical data binning</a>, you have data that you want to group into "bins". E.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>You have data on different fruits and want to group "lemon" and "orange" into
"citrus".</li>
<li>You have data on students' grades and want to group scores between 80 and 90
into "B", scores between 90 and 100 into "A", etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>To me, a straightforward approach is to write a function that computes the bin.
E.g., binning fruits:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>def bin_fruit(fruit):
    if fruit in ["lemon", "orange"]:
        return "citrus"
    elif fruit in ["apple", "pear"]:
        return "malinae"


import random

data = random.choices(
    ["lemon", "orange", "apple", "pear"], k=10
)
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>['lemon',
 'lemon',
 'apple',
 'apple',
 'apple',
 'lemon',
 'apple',
 'apple',
 'lemon',
 'pear']
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[bin_fruit(x) for x in data]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>['citrus',
 'citrus',
 'malinae',
 'malinae',
 'malinae',
 'citrus',
 'malinae',
 'malinae',
 'citrus',
 'malinae']
</code></pre>
<p>E.g., turning test scores into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_grading_in_the_United_States">letter grades</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>def bin_score(score):
    if 90 &lt;= score &lt;= 100:
        return "A"
    elif 80 &lt;= score &lt; 90:
        return "B"
    elif 70 &lt;= score &lt; 80:
        return "C"
    elif 60 &lt;= score &lt; 70:
        return "D"
    elif score &lt; 60:
        return "F"


import random

data = [random.randint(50, 100) for _ in range(10)]
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>[78, 87, 93, 78, 53, 92, 64, 70, 75, 60]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[bin_score(x) for x in data]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>['C', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'F', 'A', 'D', 'C', 'C', 'D']
</code></pre>
<p>For a dataset of <var>n</var> records and <var>m</var> bins, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time
complexity</a> of this approach tends to be</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation">O</a>(<var>m</var><var>n</var>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because binning one record takes O(<var>m</var>) time -- O(<var>m</var>)
if-statements are checked -- and <var>n</var> records need to be binned.</p>
<p>If the number of bins <var>m</var> is constant, then the overall time
complexity is simply O(<var>n</var>).</p>
<p>But what if the number of bins <var>m</var> is large enough that the
straightforward approach is too slow?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_or_discrete_variable">discrete data</a>, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict">dictionaries</a>. E.g., binning
fruits:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>bins = {
    "lemon": "citrus",
    "orange": "citrus",
    "apple": "malinae",
    "pear": "malinae",
}

def bin_fruit(fruit):
    return bins[fruit]


import random

data = random.choices(
    ["lemon", "orange", "apple", "pear"], k=10
)
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>['lemon',
 'pear',
 'lemon',
 'lemon',
 'apple',
 'orange',
 'apple',
 'orange',
 'pear',
 'apple']
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[bin_fruit(x) for x in data]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>['citrus',
 'malinae',
 'citrus',
 'citrus',
 'malinae',
 'citrus',
 'malinae',
 'citrus',
 'malinae',
 'malinae']
</code></pre>
<p>Binning one record this way takes O(1) time -- regardless of the number of
bins <var>m</var> -- because <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict">dictionaries</a> are implemented using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">hash tables</a>. And creating the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict">dictionary</a> take O(<var>m</var>) time --
one entry for each bin. Thus, the overall time complexity, for <var>n</var>
records and <var>m</var> bins, is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O(<var>m</var> + <var>n</var>).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And, for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_or_discrete_variable">continuous data</a>, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.bisect">bisect.bisect</a>. E.g., turning
test scores into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_grading_in_the_United_States">letter grades</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>score_bins = [60, 70, 80, 90]
score_letters = ["F", "D", "C", "B", "A"]

import bisect


def bin_score(score):
    i = bisect.bisect(score_bins, score)
    return score_letters[i]


import random

data = [random.randint(50, 100) for _ in range(10)]
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>[60, 100, 88, 98, 55, 52, 52, 94, 71, 85]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[bin_score(x) for x in data]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>['D', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'A', 'C', 'B']
</code></pre>
<p>Binning one record this way takes O(logÂ&nbsp;<var>m</var>) time, because
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.bisect">bisect.bisect</a> uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">binary search</a> to navigate <code>score_bins</code>. And
creating <code>score_bins</code> takes O(<var>m</var>) time. Thus, the overall time
complexity, for <var>n</var> records and <var>m</var> bins, is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O(<var>m</var> + <var>n</var> log <var>m</var>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>NOTE: If you are able to use 3rd-party libraries, such as <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a> or
<a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a>, then look at these functions: <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.digitize.html">numpy.digitize</a>,
<a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.searchsorted.html#numpy.searchsorted">numpy.searchsorted</a>, <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.searchsorted.html">pandas.Series.searchsorted</a>, <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.qcut.html#pandas.qcut">pandas.qcut</a>,
<a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.cut.html">pandas.cut</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In this scenario, you have a sorted list of data and you want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_statistic">order statistics</a> (e.g. compute the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median">median</a>).</li>
<li>Add new data.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, you can imagine having a temperature sensor that regularly reports
the temperature. You want to regularly report the median temperature, as well
as be able to incorporate new temperature data as it arrives.</p>
<p>To me, a straightforward approach is to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mutable-sequence-types">list.append</a> and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.median">statistics.median</a>. E.g., monitoring temperatures:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>def add_new_measurement(data, temperature):
    data.append(temperature)


def median(data):
    return statistics.median(data)


import random
import statistics

data = [random.randint(93, 100) for _ in range(10)]
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>[98, 94, 97, 94, 94, 98, 98, 94, 94, 95]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>median(data)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>94.5
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>add_new_measurement(data, 97)
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>[98, 94, 97, 94, 94, 98, 98, 94, 94, 95, 97]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>median(data)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>95
</code></pre>
<p>For a dataset of <var>n</var> records, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time complexity</a> of this approach
tends to be</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Computing median:</strong> O(<var>n</var>) or O(<var>n</var> log <var>n</var>) --
depending on how the median is computed.</li>
<li><strong>Adding new data:</strong> O(1).</li>
</ul>
<p>So if the workload requires frequently adding new data and infrequently
computing the median, this approach works well.</p>
<p>But what if the workload is inverted? For example, if temperature measurements
are received every couple of minutes, but the median must be computed every
couple of seconds.</p>
<p>In that scenario, I think we would be better suited by speeding up computing
the median, even at the expense of slowing down adding new data.</p>
<p>Computing order statistics can be done in O(1) time if the data is already
sorted. So a straightforward way to handle this workload would be to sort the
data after appending and use the fact that the data is sorted to efficiently
compute the median:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>def add_new_measurement(data, temperature):
    data.append(temperature)
    data.sort()


def median(data):
    n = len(data)
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return (data[(n // 2) - 1] + data[n // 2]) / 2
    else:
        return data[n // 2]


import random

data = sorted(random.randint(93, 100) for _ in range(10))
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>[93, 94, 94, 96, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 100]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>median(data)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>96.5
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>add_new_measurement(data, 97)
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>[93, 94, 94, 96, 96, 97, 97, 98, 99, 100, 100]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>median(data)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>97
</code></pre>
<p>For a dataset of <var>n</var> records, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time complexity</a> of this approach
tends to be</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Computing median:</strong> O(1).</li>
<li><strong>Adding new data:</strong> O(<var>n</var> log <var>n</var>).</li>
</ul>
<p>But I think that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time complexity</a> for adding new data can further be
improved by using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.insort">bisect.insort</a>, which runs in</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O(<var>n</var>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's Python code that does that:</p>
<pre><code>import bisect


def add_new_measurement(data, temperature):
    bisect.insort(data, temperature)
</code></pre>
<p>Doing this changes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time complexity</a> of adding new data from</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O(<var>n</var> log <var>n</var>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O(<var>n</var>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this week's post you learned how to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html">bisect</a> module for
statistical data binning and adding new data to sorted lists.</p>
<p>For further reading:</p>
<ul>
<li>Algorithms that process input piece-by-piece -- like the temperature sensor
scenario -- are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_algorithm">online algorithms</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.insort">bisect.insort</a> can be used to implement an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort">Insertion sort</a>. Insertion
sort is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_algorithm">online algorithm</a> and -- along with Python's built-in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort">timsort</a> -- is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_sort">adaptive sorting algorithm</a> because it takes
advantage of data that is partially sorted.</li>
</ul>
<p>My challenge to you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html">bisect</a> module provides "left"- and "right"-variants of
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.insort">bisect.insort</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.bisect">bisect.bisect</a>: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.insort_left">bisect.insort_left</a>,

<p>Read the documentation and figure out what the difference between the "left"-

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <section id="main_content">
        

<p>Some days back I assembled a top of the line(ish) workstation for working on hobby projects and gaming. I bought the latest and greatest processor (Ryzen 3900x - 12 Core 24 Threads) from AMD and 32 GB of RAM for a no-compromises experience. I assembled the PC and it was blazing fast. I configured the system to run Windows and Linux (PopOS) using dual booting. I already had an SSD from a previous build that had the Linux OS installed and configured. I had my Twitter crawls set up on it and other services set up and working on it. I used Linux for Productivity and Windows mostly gaming as is the custom.</p>

<p>After some time, I realized this arrangement came with a very obvious drawback. Whenever I used to game, my Twitter crawls and other services in Linux, were effectively shut down. To solve this issue, I changed the boot order to set the Linux OS to boot by default. Even then, I wasn’t ready to accept this tradeoff when I had a processor that was more than capable of handling both of these OSes at the same time. If I were to somehow manage, to virtualize the existing Linux installation I had, the CPU I bought wouldn’t even break sweat handling both my OSes at the same time. I am also lazy and found it very hard to switch off a running OS and switch to the other one frequently. I just wanted to reduce my overhead.</p>

<p>So summarizing the above, I wanted to boot the already existing Linux installation I had on a different SSD as a guest VM in windows. I already had a Windows 10 Professional version so, the choice of hypervisor was easy, as this particular version of Windows comes with Hyper-V. The challenge here is booting from an actual hard disk instead of a virtual hard disk. The problems with the above approach are</p>

<ol>
  <li>Passthrough the hard disk (having Linux installation) directly to the VM</li>
  <li>Boot from this hard disk by using virtualized GRUB media</li>
  <li>Solve other issues for smooth operation</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="enabling-virtualization-and-hyperv">Enabling virtualization and HyperV</h2>

<p>The first step in this process is to activate Virtualization features from the BIOS and enable it in Windows. In my case, it was a simple setting in BIOS called Secure Virtual Machine Mode (SVM) which when enabled allows you to use HyperV in Windows. Enabling HyperV in Windows is then straight forward. Follow the below steps to activate HyperV.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Search Windows Features in the Windows search bar.</li>
  <li>Click the checkbox near Hyper-V. Press OK and you should be done.</li>
  <li>Windows will restart once to enable this feature.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://bagdeabhishek.github.io/images/enableHV.PNG" alt="EnableHyperV"></p>

<h2 id="passing-through-the-ssd-to-vm">Passing through the SSD to VM</h2>
<p>The next challenge here is to make sure the actual media (SSD in my case) is passed through without interference to the VM we create. You have to make sure Windows is not using this media and forwards it cleanly to our target VM.</p>
<h3 id="make-the-device-offline-in-windows">Make the device offline in Windows</h3>
<p>To make sure that the media we are passing to the new VM is not being used by the host OS, we need to make sure the disk is offline. You can do that by doing the following steps.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the Disk Management tool by searching for it in the Windows search bar.</li>
  <li>All your disks should appear at the bottom along with all the partitions in the bottom.</li>
  <li>Go to the Linux media you want to forward (the drive which has Linux installed on it) and left-click on it. You’ll get an option to make this device offline, click on it. Now the disk should be offline and the UI should be reflecting the change.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://bagdeabhishek.github.io/images/offlineHDD.PNG" alt="offlineHDD"></p>

<h3 id="create-a-vm-using-hyperv">Create a VM using HyperV</h3>
<p>Once you complete the above step, you need to create a VM using HyperV. Go to HyperV Manager and create a new VM. Create a new VM with all the necessary configurations like memory and CPU cores. While creating a new VM make sure that you select generation 2 (No specific reason just seems newer and better suited to me) in the Specify Generation section and in the Connect Virtual Hard disk section select the “Attach a Virtual Hard disk later” option. Once you do that your VM should be created. To mount our Linux media and make sure we can boot to it we need to do a device passthrough to the VM.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to the settings of the newly created VM, under the SCSI controller section you need to add a Hard disk.</li>
  <li>In the media section your Linux HDD should show up under the Physical Hard disk section. Select the Hard disk and click apply.</li>
  <li>Mount any other disks if needed.</li>
  <li>Download the SuperGrub 2 disk image from <a href="https://www.supergrubdisk.org/super-grub2-disk/">here</a></li>
  <li>In the DVD drive under the SCSI section select the recently downloaded ISO as an image file. 
<img src="https://bagdeabhishek.github.io/images/HDD.PNG" alt="VMHDDConfiguration"></li>
</ol>

<p>SuperGrub2 helps us to solve the issue of not finding the GRUB partition as we are booting in a VM. We use SuperGrub2 to boot into our Linux install.</p>

<p>Once you are done, keep the DVD drive boot priority highest.</p>

<h2 id="disable-snapshots">Disable Snapshots</h2>

<p>HyperV won’t allow you to boot the created VM as the HyperV Manager cannot create a snapshot. This is because our installation media is an actual HDD instead of a virtual one. You can disable Snapshotting by going to the VM settings -&gt; Management -&gt; Checkpoints and deselect the “Enable Checkpoints” check box.</p>

<h2 id="boot-into-the-linux-vm">Boot into the Linux VM</h2>

<p>Once you are done with the above steps you can spin up the VM and you should be able to boot into the SuperGrub Menu. In this menu select the “Detect and show boot methods” entry.</p>

<p><img src="https://bagdeabhishek.github.io/dualbootasVM/imagesgrub.PNG" alt="superGrub"></p>

<p>You should then be able to select your Linux version and be able to boot into it.</p>

<h2 id="configure-the-display-driver">Configure the display driver</h2>
<p>If you were using Nvidia proprietary drivers on the existing Linux installation you’ll need to remove them. Once you do that you need to install the xserver-xorg-video-fbdev package to make xorg server work.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>apt-get <span>install </span>xserver-xorg-video-fbdev 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I also added an x11 configuration file which might or might not have helped. Adding it just in case this might help someone. Create a new file /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/30-hyperv.conf and add the below snippet to it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Section <span>"Device"</span>
 Identifier <span>"HYPER_V Framebuffer"</span>
 Driver <span>"fbdev"</span>
EndSection
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I wasn’t able to boot into the GUI (though CLI is still accessible) without the above fixes. Once you do that and reboot you should be able to boot into the Linux GUI.</p>



<p>Congratulations! you now have a Virtualized version of your Linux Installation which can be accessed inside your Windows OS. The advantage of this approach is you can still normally boot into the Linux OS and all your changes are consistent across both VM and the actual Linux system as the media is the same. The only problem I can see is enabling GPU drivers. In the future maybe I can dynamically switch the display drivers based on the context.</p>

<p>This method also won’t work if your Linux install exists on the same Hard disk. I feel in that case just converting the whole partition to a VHDX file would be easier. This method has its own drawbacks like the data won’t be consistent across both instances.</p>

					<div><p>PASK – Pianists for Alternatively Sized Keyboards – is an international movement committed to achieving change in relation to piano keyboard size.</p><p>Specifically, PASK aims to convince piano manufacturers to begin producing piano keyboards in three standard sizes. Purchasers of new pianos will then have a choice of keyboard size. In addition to the current ‘large’ size, we need two additional sizes with <u>narrower keys</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The current piano keyboard has prevailed since the 1880’s and was not designed for the physical capabilities of the population at large. It has been assumed that the current size is suitable for all, whereas in fact it is isn’t. The keys are too wide for the majority of pianists, considering men, women and children of all nationalities and across all age groups.</p><p>The current keyboard size and key width suits people with large hands, generally adult males with average to above average spans. However, for those with smaller hands, today’s piano increases technical difficulties and learning time. It limits musical expression and prevents access to a large amount of the piano repertoire. Worst of all, it can cause debilitating pain and injury.</p><p>A simple analogy illustrates the point. Does it make sense that all men in an athletics race should have to wear the same size shoes? And that female athletes have to run in the same size shoes as the men? And that children have to run in the same size shoes as adults?</p></div>

					<div><p>The<strong> long term goal of PASK </strong>is for acoustic and digital piano manufacturers to offer a choice of three standard keyboard sizes in accordance with the DS standards. These are: DS5.5® (7/8) and the DS6.0® (15/16) as well as the current ‘large’ DS6.5<em>&nbsp;</em>keyboard. They need to be&nbsp;mass-produced and marketed worldwide in such a way that the new alternative sizes are readily available and naturally accepted options for all pianists and teachers.&nbsp;</p><p>For this to happen, we need to focus on both building the demand from the piano world as well as encouraging supply from manufacturers. Clearly, these are interdependent.&nbsp;</p><p>Pianists with smaller hands must create a united voice and demand access to keyboards with narrower keys. Piano teachers, universities and conservatoriums need to recognise their benefits. Competitions and concert venues should provide a choice of keyboard for performers.</p><p>Alternatively sized keyboards are currently only available from a limited number of sources, are expensive and often involve long wait times for customers. The major piano manufacturers need to take up this challenge.&nbsp;A key factor in creating change will be public support from prominent pianists, academics and teachers around the world.</p><p>There are three main strategies required to achieve this goal:</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raising awareness of the benefits of reduced size keyboards for those with smaller hands.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creating opportunities for pianists to experience the difference in playing on narrower keys.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Breaking down barriers and resistance to change.</p></div>

					<p>PASK is not a formally constituted organisation, but a network of people working towards a common goal.

There are three founders of PASK:

Ms Erica Booker from Sydney, Australia – Graduate of the New South Wales Conservatorium of Music, pianist and piano teacher. Erica is also a Suzuki teacher trainer and leading advocate for alternatively sized piano keyboards:<a href="https://ericabookerpiano.com/%E2%80%8B" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://ericabookerpiano.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://ericabookerpiano.com</a>

Dr Carol Leone from Dallas, Texas – Chair of Keyboard Studies at SMU Meadows School of the Arts in Dallas, internationally recognized performing artist, teacher, lecturer, and author. Carol is one of the world’s leading researchers and proponents of ergonomic piano keyboards to promote a pianist’s wellness:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.carolleone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.carolleone.com</a>

Ms Rhonda Boyle from Melbourne, Australia – Former government policy analyst/strategic planner with qualifications in physics, environmental science and urban planning. Rhonda is a pianist, independent researcher and author of peer-reviewed articles relating to hand size and piano playing:

<span>These three founders have no financial connections with any piano or keyboard manufacturers.</span>

The PASK network is gradually growing and now includes many others around the world who support the PASK goals and who are actively engaged in encouraging change.

					<div><p>The term ESPK (ergonomically scaled piano keyboard) is now mostly used in the academic community when referring to keyboards smaller than the current ‘standard’ size i.e., with 6.5 inch octave. The term ‘reduced-size keyboard’ has also been used in some literature. &nbsp;Also note that the DS5.5®<em>&nbsp;</em>is often referred to as the ‘7/8 keyboard’ as the key widths are close to (but not exactly) 7/8 of the ‘standard’ keyboard.

(Chris Donison and David Steinbuhler pioneered the introduction of piano keyboards with narrower keys for acoustic pianos, mainly in North America.) &nbsp;The PASK movement (Pianists for Alternatively Sized Keyboards) generally uses the term ‘alternative sizes’ to avoid confusion as ‘reduced size’ could imply fewer than 88 keys.</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      

      <p><i>4<sup>th</sup> November, 2016</i></p>

      <p>
	<q>SVG 2 is on life support.</q>
      </p>
      
      <h2>Background</h2>

      <p>
	About a month ago the W3C's SVG staff contact person (Doug
	Schepers) relayed some very alarming news... that the SVG
	Working Group charter was not going to be renewed when it
	expired at the end of October, 2016. This was quite shocking
	as the group had worked quite hard to get the SVG 2
	specification to
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#Reports"><i>Candidate
	Recommendation</i></a> status. If the charter is not renewed,
	it would mean <span>an immediate end to
	SVG 2</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
	While shocking and unexpected, it didn't come out of left field.
	The active participation in the working group has dropped to
	just a handful of people, none representing any of the browser
	vendors. In fact, the last two "face-to-face" meetings had
	attendance of just three regular participants, one from Canon
	(which is dropping membership in the W3C as the end of the year)
	and two <q>invited experts</q> who are working for free. The weekly
	teleconferences were down to four or five participants (with
	representatives from KDDI and the W3C).
      </p>

      <h2>Recent Developments</h2>

      <p>
	The working group appealed to the browser vendors for support
	in renewing the charter. A teleconference was organized with
	multiple representatives from each of the major browser
	vendors as well as a number of other interested parties
	(Adobe, Canon, KDDI, etc.). The general consensus from the
	browser vendors is that SVG 2 should be finished but that it
	should be restricted to <q>fixing</q> the problems with SVG
	1.1 2nd edition along with a few choice selected new features
	(like 'paint-order') which have already been implemented by
	multiple browsers. <span>New features
	(meshes, hatches, etc.) should be removed and pushed into
	a <a href="https://wicg.io/">WICG group</a>.</span> (Wrapped
	text was not discussed.) (See
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/10/06-svg-minutes.html">minutes</a>.)
	A resolution was made to <q>Re-charter SVG WG for one more year
	with a focus on moving SVG 2 to REC with only the features that
	have implementer experience.</q> Note that this is a WG resolution
	and not a W3C agreement to continue the group.
      </p>
      <p>
	With a focus on a limited SVG 2 specification, the W3C has
	agreed to extend the current SVG Working Group charter until the
	end of January in order to give the group a chance to sort out a
	new charter. Any new charter will focus on completing SVG 2 by
	developing a test suite and in pushing for implementations.
      </p>
      <p>
	An additional discussion by the WG was that all joint CSS/SVG
	specifications will be completely taken over by CSS. This
	includes
	<a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-transforms/">Transforms</a>,
	<a href="https://drafts.fxtf.org/filters/">Filters</a>,
	<a href="https://drafts.fxtf.org/css-masking-1/">Masking and Clipping</a>,
	<a href="https://drafts.fxtf.org/compositing-1/">Compositing and Blending</a>,
	etc. This completes the long process of CSS
	<span>stealing</span>
	absorbing the most interesting SVG features.
      </p>

      <h2>Future</h2>

      <p>
	The future is pretty cloudy at the moment. Here are some observations:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    There are only two browser implementations of importance:
	    Blink (Chrome/Opera) and Gecko (Firefox). Of these, only
	    Blink has the resources to fully implement new features
	    quickly although Gecko has implemented more of SVG
	    2. Chrome commands a huge lead in browser market share
	    (almost 75%). Google has a habit of unilaterally removing
	    features it doesn't like from Blink, basically dictating
	    that those features are removed from specifications.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Two other significant browser implementations, WebKit
	    (Safari) and Edge, are more followers than leaders and
	    have relatively little market share (5% and 4%
	    respectively).  For example, Microsoft explicitly stated
	    that they would not even look at SVG 2 until the
	    specification was a Candidate Recommendation (while the
	    other browser vendors have implemented a limited set of
	    SVG 2 features such as 'paint-order', see
	    <a href="https://nikosandronikos.github.io/svg2-info/svg2-feature-support/">SVG
	    2 Feature Support</a> for current status of SVG 2
	    implementation).
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    There seems to be a disconnect between the browser vendors
	    and the content creators. Even Adobe has expressed
	    frustrations with the current status (and they have
	    significantly reduced their involvement with W3C as a
	    result).
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    Moving things into a WICG is not a viable strategy.
	    Without browser vendor buy-in, things are likely to never
	    emerge from a WICG group. In addition, a WICG group is
	    intended to develop new ideas to the point where the
	    browser vendors can have a look at them. Both meshes and
	    hatches are already well developed with Inkscape
	    supporting full rendering for several years. (Note that
	    the browsers already have code to render meshes as they
	    all support meshes in PDF.)
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    Despite the large turnout for the SVG WG meeting where we
	    discussed the future of SVG 2, we have received almost no
	    feedback (after requesting it several times) from the
	    browser vendors on which SVG 2 features they are likely to
	    implement. This seems to be indicative of the low interest
	    they have in implementing SVG 2.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    Even the CSS working group, which has a much larger active
	    participation, is having trouble getting their specifications
	    out. Both SVG and CSS seem to be <q>passé</q>. The new
	    darling of the browser vendor set is
	    <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/03/houdini-maybe-the-most-exciting-development-in-css-youve-never-heard-of/">Houdini</a> which offers lower level
	    access to browser internals. This is not unexpected as
	    browsers continue on the path to being the new OS.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    The most important long term observation is that browser
	    vendors respond to demand. I've been told SVG would never
	    have been part of HTML5 if it wasn't for Inkscape which
	    allowed the production of tons of SVG's used in the
	    Wikipedia. Browser vendors keep track of the use of
	    various features. <span>Features with
	    more use get more attention.</span>
	  </p>
	</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What should Inkscape do?</h3>

      <p>
	Given the above observations, if we really want mesh, hatches,
	etc. to remain part of SVG 2 and to be supported by
	browsers <span>we must generate content that
	uses those features</span>; content that gets people excited
	enough to put pressure on the browser vendors to implement
	them.  We've already started to do this in a limited way by
	enabling the use of 'paint-order' which is supported by three
	of the four major browsers.
      </p>
      <p>
	Of course this means that some artwork created using Inkscape
	won't be viewable directly on the web. We should accept this
	as a necessary (and hopefully temporary) step. We can provide
	warnings in Inkscape when artists use features that are not
	widely supported. We can advise artists of work-arounds, i.e.
	converting a mesh to an internal image when exporting. And we
	can provide
	<q><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill">polyfills</a></q>
	that replace internal browser functionality with JavaScript
	implementations. (I've already started work on a mesh gradient
	polyfill.)
      </p>
      <p>
	I've been working on improvements to the mesh gradient
	GUI. This work has been back-ported to 0.92. We plan on
	enabling mesh gradients by default in the 0.92 release. This
	will start generating public content that uses mesh gradients.
      </p>

<strong>FreeBSD - a lesson in poor defaults</strong>
<hr>

<p>
Last updated: 09/25/2020. 
<small><a href="https://twitter.com/blakkheim">@blakkheim</a></small>

</p><p>
This page lists some of the changes I make to a vanilla install of FreeBSD
for security hardening. Some changes to increase network performance or make
things a bit more more sane are also included. It only covers basic changes
that a sysadmin can make to a running system.

</p><p>
It could also be considered a commentary piece on the state of security in
FreeBSD's development ecosystem, highlighting their strong resistance to
change and unwillingness to replace old cruft with modern alternatives.

</p><p>
The project's
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/security.html">security page</a>
says the following:

</p><blockquote><em>
FreeBSD takes security very seriously and its developers are constantly
working on making the operating system as secure as possible.
</em></blockquote>

<p>
But is that really true? Let's find out.

<h2 id="openssh">OpenSSH Modifications</h2>

FreeBSD has a history of making "interesting" choices with regard to the
version of OpenSSH they bundle in the base system, often deliberately going
against upstream in the name of retaining backward compatibility or to gain
perceived performance improvements. Disabling or ignoring security features
in favor of performance seems to be a recurring theme, as we'll see later on.

<p>
It is my belief that quite a few poor decisions have been made in this area.
As a primary example, they insisted on maintaining the
<a href="https://www.psc.edu/hpn-ssh">HPN-SSH</a> patchset and enabling it
by default for quite a long time.

</p><p>
You might say "Well OK, but what's actually <em>wrong</em> with those patches?"

</p><p>
OpenSSH increased the channel limits enough to support a cross-country gigabit
connection without slowdown years ago. For most users, this means that the HPN
patches are an unnecessary complexity with little or no benefit. In addition
to that, they would frequently hold FreeBSD back from updating their version
of OpenSSH because of HPN backporting and manual refactoring of the patchset.

</p><p>
Support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_Wrappers">tcp_wrappers</a>
was abandoned long ago in OpenSSH upstream, but FreeBSD still
<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&amp;revision=294328">patched it back in</a> and enabled it for everyone.

</p><p>
The same was true for weak DSA host keys, which they
<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&amp;revision=294495">switched back on</a> for compatibility with older clients.

</p><p>
FreeBSD also
<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&amp;revision=296634">re-enabled</a>
insecure encryption ciphers in their build after they were disabled upstream,
with backward compatibility apparently being more important to them than the
security of their users.

</p><p>
If we don't deprecate insecure options bit by bit somewhere in the ecosystem,
we end up with a situation like OpenSSL. Pressure has to be applied somewhere.
One can be part of that team, or one can play against them. In this case,
FreeBSD is the team trying to increase the risk.

</p><p>
They've made local changes to their OpenSSH build and its default config files
that left their users vulnerable when other platforms were unaffected. Here's
a (possibly incomplete) list of examples:

</p><ul>

</li></ul>

<p>
A list of FreeBSD's modifications to both the code and config files can be
seen
<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/crypto/openssh/FREEBSD-upgrade?view=markup#l93">here</a>
for the base system (possibly outdated/unmaintained) and 
<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/security/openssh-portable/files">here</a>
for the ports version.

</p><p>
Thankfully, as hinted above, it's fairly easy to install OpenSSH from ports
with all the FreeBSDisms removed. Their
<a href="https://www.freshports.org/security/openssh-portable">openssh-portable</a>
port has a hefty set of options you can toggle:

</p><pre>BLACKLISTD      FreeBSD blacklistd(8) support
BSM             OpenBSM Auditing
DOCS            Build and/or install documentation
FIDO_U2F        FIDO/U2F support (security/libfido2)
HPN             HPN-SSH patch
KERB_GSSAPI     Kerberos/GSSAPI patch (req: GSSAPI)
LDNS            SSHFP/LDNS support
LIBEDIT         Command line editing via libedit
NONECIPHER      NONE Cipher support
PAM             Pluggable authentication module support
TCP_WRAPPERS    tcp_wrappers support
XMSS            XMSS key support (experimental)
MIT             MIT Kerberos (security/krb5)
HEIMDAL         Heimdal Kerberos (security/heimdal)
HEIMDAL_BASE    Heimdal Kerberos (base)
</pre>

<p>
Besides the modifications mentioned above, two other patches in particular
have been popular with FreeBSD users: threaded AES-CTR and the "NONE" cipher.

</p><p>
Threaded AES-CTR, as the name might imply, introduces threads to the code.
OpenSSH developerss have publicly said threads are too risky and won't be
added. What's more, it's largely obsoleted by AES-NI in modern CPUs and the
fact that ChaCha20-Poly1305 (the current default cipher) is even faster
when taking the message authentication code (MAC) into consideration.

</p><p>
The NONE cipher is somewhat of a misfeature, removing the encryption bits
and only keeping the data integrity. It allows users to accidentally shoot
themselves in the foot pretty easily. The trade-off in performance isn't
really worth it either, as the bottlenecks one might experience have a lot
more to do with the MAC than the actual encryption overhead.

</p><p>
I recommend disabling all of the port options. The majority of users don't
need the extra risk that any of these non-standard patches introduce.

</p><p>
As for the <code>/usr/local/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> file, I would recommend
enabling only modern crypto. However, cryptography is a very complicated and
important topic, so you would be better served to research each algorithm and
come to your own conclusions instead of just taking my word. Thankfully,
upstream OpenSSH cares about security and continues to remove old, broken
algorithms as time goes on. FreeBSD can't keep patching them back in and
maintaining their backports. It's simply too much work.

</p><p>
This isn't meant to be an entire SSH tutorial, but consider changing your
default port to something other than 22 if you want less spam in your logs,
set up public keys and disable password authentication... the usual stuff.

</p><p>
The following config lines are just to revert FreeBSD's local changes that
introduce new risks:

</p><pre>ChallengeResponseAuthentication no         
UsePAM                          no 
VersionAddendum                 none  # Prevent some OS information from being
                                      # leaked by your sshd, another one of
                                      # FreeBSD's "enhancements" in both the
                                      # base system and ports version.
X11Forwarding                   no        
</pre>

<p>
In addition to improved security, using the port of OpenSSH allows you to
upgrade to newer versions much faster than waiting for a new release of the
base system. As an example, FreeBSD has comically been limited to "upgrading"
their base OpenSSH to a release that's
<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&amp;revision=357926">three versions behind the current one at the time</a>
because of their local patches. Note that you may need further configuration
changes if using the bundled OpenSSH, as its options aren't as easily fixable.

</p><h2 id="mail">Mailer Daemon</h2>

FreeBSD includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sendmail">Sendmail</a>
in the base system and enables it by default.

<p>
I'd like to share a quote from one of the earliest security advisories FreeBSD
ever published:

</p><blockquote><em>
The sendmail mail transfer agent has a rather poor reputation
for security related problems.  FreeBSD ships a version of
sendmail that has all known security problems fixed, but this
doesn't mean there won't be more found in the future.
</em></blockquote>

And it turns out whoever wrote that
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-96:03.sendmail-suggestion.asc">back in 1996</a>
wasn't wrong.

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-01:57.sendmail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-01:57.sendmail</a>
</li><li>
<a href="https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-03:04.sendmail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-03:04.sendmail</a>
</li><li>
<a href="https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-03:07.sendmail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-03:07.sendmail</a>
</li><li>
<a href="https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-03:11.sendmail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-03:11.sendmail</a>
</li><li>
<a href="https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-03:13.sendmail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-03:13.sendmail</a>
</li><li>
<a href="https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-06:13.sendmail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-06:13.sendmail</a>
</li><li>
<a href="https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-06:17.sendmail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-06:17.sendmail</a>
</li><li>
<a href="https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-14:11.sendmail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-14:11.sendmail</a>
</li></ul>

There are
<a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vendor/31/Sendmail.html">many more</a>
where those came from.

<p>
Even with Sendmail's reputation, FreeBSD has kept it around and left it on
by default for all their users.

</p><p>
To make matters worse, FreeBSD sometimes imports
<a href="https://marc.info/?l=sendmail-announce&amp;m=159394546814125&amp;w=2">sendmail updates</a>
with
<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&amp;revision=363233">no mention</a>
of the included security fixes. As you might guess, this means no advisory
is published, and most users don't get those security fixes for a long time,

</p><p>
I think most users will agree that this old program is mostly just a bother.
A full mail server, especially one that's been full of holes since the 90s,
shouldn't be in the base system at all if you ask me. Something simple for
local mail delivery should be enough.

</p><p>
I stop all the related services because it makes startup slower and I'd like
as few things running in the background as possible. The lines needed to
disable Sendmail will be in the rc.conf section later on.

</p><p>
If you actually run a mail server, there are better options like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postfix_(software)">Postfix</a> or
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/opensmtpd">OpenSMTPD</a>.
If you only need to send mail through a third party provider like
Gmail, <a href="https://marlam.de/msmtp/">msmtp</a> is a another
lightweight alternative. All three are in ports.

</p><h2 id="firewall">Firewall</h2>

There are three firewalls included with FreeBSD: IPFW, PF, and IPFilter.
None of them are enabled by default.

<p>
I don't know anything about IPFilter, nor do I know anyone that uses it,
so we'll pretend it doesn't exist. IPFW is the native firewall.
It was written by FreeBSD, for FreeBSD, with their usual coding standards.
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-20:10.ipfw.asc">The</a>
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-20:12.libalias.asc">result</a>
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-20:13.libalias.asc">is</a>
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-06:04.ipfw.asc">about</a>
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-05:13.ipfw.asc">what</a>

<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-96:14.ipfw.asc">expect</a>.
PF is the OpenBSD firewall. It was ported from OpenBSD to FreeBSD. Which one
you use mostly comes down to preference. Since I'm more familiar with PF,
that's what I use. Unfortunately, the version of PF included with FreeBSD
hasn't been synced with upstream <strong>since 2009</strong>. Do you want
such a critical component of your OS or network device left largely
unmaintained?

</p><p>
Check the documentation for whichever firewall you decide to use for proper
configuration instructions.

</p><h2 id="portspkg">Ports and Packages</h2>

Other than just manually compiling things yourself, there are three main ways
to install software on FreeBSD:

<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pkg">pkg</a> tool (with binary packages built by the project infrastructure)
</li><li>The <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/ports-using.html">ports</a> system, allowing for custom options in many applications
</li><li>The <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/poudriere">poudriere</a>…</li></ul></div>

November 21, 2020 | http://blog.benwiener.com/economics/2020/11/19/vaccine-delays.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://blog.benwiener.com/economics/2020/11/19/vaccine-delays.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I keep hearing about small delays in the vaccine development process that I don’t understand given how urgent the need is. I read a perfect example today. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/18/health/pfizer-covid-vaccine.html">A New York Times article</a> sharing good news about the effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine mentioned that the company would be applying for emergency use authorization “within days”. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/16/health/Covid-moderna-vaccine.html%22">A similar article</a> cited a period of weeks for the Moderna vaccine. This progress is great news. It made me wonder, though, why not today? What prevented these companies from being ready to file with the FDA right away?</p>

<p>By all accounts, the rapid progress of COVID-19 vaccine candidates has been miraculous. Still, I’m confused by the apparent lack of urgency in certain parts of the process. Most of the vaccine development work is probably difficult to speed up. For example, it isn’t possible to speed up the rate at which trial participants get exposed to the virus so that effectiveness can be proven<sup id="fnref:hcc" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hcc">1</a></sup>. But what prevents Pfizer and Moderna from pre-writing their application to the FDA while the trial is running and netting a few days or weeks? Even just a few days has serious value. Of course, the data is still coming in so there would be some uncertainty about what should be written in the application. But they must have a pretty good sense of how the trial is going. They could even pre-write two or three versions to cover the most likely scenarios. And of all possible trial outcomes, why would these companies both be unprepared for best-case scenarios where their vaccines are proving to be highly effective?</p>

<p>Getting a bit more speculative, why aren’t scientists at Pfizer and Moderna already in conversation with decision makers at the FDA so that the evaluation process can be started based on preliminary data? Then they could be possibly be ready to issue emergency use authorization immediately once the trial concludes. If there is an unexpected change in the latest data regulators should of course be prepared to reassess. To be clear, I am not suggesting that the approval process be less rigorous. I just want it happening in parallel with the trial as much as it can. Given how ridiculously destructive this pandemic is, I sure hope COVID vaccines are the FDA’s top priority.</p>

<p>This possibility reminds me of the mechanics of my thesis defense. My adviser, the main decision maker, was already very familiar with my work. Little information was actually transmitted to him that day. He already knew what he needed to know to make his decision. In fact, we wouldn’t have even gone forward with the defense if he wasn’t ready to pass me. He didn’t take a month after the defense to closely read my thesis, consider all the arguments, check the math, and then deliberate. That process occurred while the data was coming in. Maybe some parallelization of the approval process like this is happening for the COVID vaccines, but I’ve never read anything that gives the sense that it is.</p>

<h3 id="possible-answers-to-my-own-questions">Possible answers to my own questions:</h3>
<h4 id="why-werent-the-eua-applications-ready">Why weren’t the EUA applications ready?</h4>

<p>Maybe a document like this is <em>way</em> more complicated than I’m imagining and the drug companies are writing them as fast as possible. This sort of suggests that writing the application is a similar challenge to developing the vaccine. I hope that’s not right.</p>

<p>Maybe the drug companies <em>are</em> already working with the FDA, and the timing of the application isn’t important. As I mentioned above, I’ve never seen anything that suggests this.</p>

<p>Maybe these companies aren’t incentivized to actually get the vaccine to market as fast as they can. Off the bat this didn’t seem right to me, but could the advance purchase agreements that Moderna and Pfizer signed with governments eliminate their urgency?</p>

<h4 id="why-arent-the-drug-companies-working-with-the-fda">Why aren’t the drug companies working with the FDA?</h4>

<p>Maybe this just isn’t the way the FDA usually works and they weren’t able to adapt to this extraordinary situation.</p>

<p>Obviously scientific integrity is important here. Maybe the scientists are intentionally kept separate from other parts of Pfizer and from the FDA to prevent some kind of academic dishonesty. I wonder about the relative dangers involved, but I could imagine an explanation like this.</p>

<h3 id="answers-that-other-people-have-suggested">Answers that other people have suggested:</h3>

<p>Commenters on Hacker News and Reddit have suggested that the things I want to happen are already happening. I’ve looked into this a little bit, and I’m unsure. Both Moderna and Pfizer have been granted the FDA’s <a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/fast-track-breakthrough-therapy-accelerated-approval-priority-review/fast-track">Fast Track status</a>. This sounds great. It apparently means these companies have the opportunity for closer collaboration with the FDA, at least on clinical trial design. Some have suggested that the companies would also already be sharing advance results from their studies, but I haven’t found any reference saying that.</p>

<p>Fast Track also gives them the opportunity to participate in Rolling Review, which allows them to submit sections of their applications as they become ready. The references I’ve found discussing this are mostly <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-submit-emergency-use-authorization">press releases by the companies</a> or closely based on them. They discuss participation in Rolling Review in Europe and elsewhere, but I haven’t seen that they are doing this in the US.</p>

        <p><span>After Steve Jobs was forced out of Apple
        in 1985, everyone wanted to know what Steve would do
        next.... so NeXT was what he did.
        <p>
        
        In 1988 his NeXT team launched a new kind of computer for
        it's time, built on standards with a Unix core but with a
        user experience "my grandma could understand". It was well
        ahead of it's time, so naturally, it was not embraced by
        main stream consumers... a classic "Crossing the Chasm"
        issue. But many saw it for what it was, a breakthrough
        product as innovative as today's iTunes, iPod and iPhone.
        </p><p>
        
        Building upon NeXT's hardware and more importantly, their
        software development environment, many third party NeXT
        developers added their own magic dust to create
        revolutionary products, like the world's first web browser,
        or a new form of spread sheet, Lotus Improv or WebObjects,
        the foundation upon which the iTune store is built, to name
        only a few. Some of these ground breaking products may
        never be repeated. Most contained innovations embraced by
        future applications, with a clear lineage back to NeXTSTEP.
        </p><p>
        
        During the relatively short time of NeXT ascendency
        (1985-1996), Apple was bleeding red ink from repeated
        financial losses and two hugely expensive attempts to
        create a follow on Operating System. Apple's third
        president since Steve's departure, Gil Amelio saw the
        merits of Steve, his team and their technology. In December
        1996 Apple bought Next. Then the Next team took over Apple.
        The result is their hugely successful Mac OS X, built on
        the foundations of the NeXTSTEP OS.
        </p><p>
        
        While NeXT is no more, as a product or a stand alone
        company, it's impact on the industry will be felt for years
        to come. We should remember it, perhaps even study it. In
        decades to come, it will be understood as a watershed of
        innovation. Current Mac and iPhone users will be astonished
        to see how many of their beloved Mac OS X innovations had
        their roots in NeXTSTEP. There are many lessons about
        product innovation, market acceptance, and the creative
        people involved, that have yet to be uncovered.
        </p><p>
        
        This web site details part of our unique collection of NeXT
        related products and assorted items which grew up around
        NeXT Computer ecosystem, including of course NeXT hardware
        but also those rare items such as dealer sales kits, logo'd
        clothing, NeXT jewelry, banners, training tapes for
        servicing NeXT computers and printers, developer guides,
        plus third party software and hardware products.
        </p><p>
        
        While the site describes only part of the actual
        collection, the site does cover over 800 NeXT and third
        party products, many with multipage brochures and white
        papers. If you were to print all the html and PDF documents
        it would be over 3,000 pages.
        </p><p>
        
        This site describes what may well be the most extensive
        NeXT related collection available today.
        </p><p>
        
        It's history worth preserving.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8dc0160ef5e99c2bfb45abd90770b186e2eba397/318dd/img/what-i-wish-i-knew-as-a-junior-dev.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I've been a developer for over fifteen years and I've loved almost every minute of it. I can't imagine doing anything different but there are moments when I think back to starting out and how different the development landscape was, especially when it comes to learning how to code.</p>
<p>I'm really <em>not</em> that old, but things in the tech world move fast and there weren't as many resources around to help people get into frontend development and learn how to build something from HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. There wasn't as many great communitys like Dev or Hashnode or WeStryve, not learning platforms such as Free Code Camp or The Odin Project.</p>
<p>So a lot of my early career felt like fumbling around for me, picking up everything I could from senior developers, hoping that they knew what they were doing, reading as many books as a I could and practicing my craft.</p>
<p>It's fair to say there were quite a few things I wish I'd known a lot earlier in my career that could have helped me progress faster or just develop both my coding skills, as well as my more complimentary skills, such as dealing with people or learning <em>how</em> to learn.</p>
<p>Hopefully, with this article I can distill what I've learned to date and share some things to watch out for and take on board to help you with your career as a frontend developer.</p>
<p><em>(Pssst -- If you like this article, come</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/kendalmintcode"><em>find me on Twitter</em></a> <em>where I post regular helpful content every day)</em></p>
<h2>Start writing a blog</h2>
<p>This very blog you're reading now (whether it's on my own website or my Dev or Hashnode accounts) has grown quite popular and that's great. But I really wish I'd started much earlier and written more frequently.</p>
<p>Honestly, blogging is such a great way to cement what you've learned <em>as you're learning it</em>. You absolutely do not have to be a developer with X years in the business, nor do you have to be an expert.</p>
<p>All you need is a curios mind and to think about writing for your past self: write the article you wish you'd had on the subject.</p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/551d70ccb71c4ae17340ca3c67475fe0bb796b93/cc36f/img/workplace-2303851_640.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>As a bonus, if you fix something particularly tricky, you'll be able to refer back to your own article to help you solve it in the future!</p>
<p>My friend Catlin Pit has a couple of recommended articles on blogging too:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://catalins.tech/should-you-start-a-blog-as-a-developer" title="Catlin Pit's article on starting a developer blog">Should you start a blog as a developer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://catalins.tech/how-to-start-your-blog-as-a-developer" title="Catalin Pit's article on how to start a blog">How to start a blog</a> - a common question after 'what do I write about?'</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ask more questions!</h2>
<p>This seems obvious, but in my experience it's really not. A lot of developers, especially those early on in their careers are easily intimidated by more experienced devs or just those that have been around longer, and this can prevent them from speaking up.</p>
<p>But you know what? That's how you learn: you ask questions, you get answers (and, back to the previous point, you now have content for a blog article!).</p>
<p>Never be afraid of asking questions, especially if you're stuck on something. There are no stupid questions, but I'm not going to lie, you will at some point come across arrogant or unhelpful people who will make you feel otherwise. My advice, ignore them and find more open and helpful people.</p>
<h2>Be honest on what you're passionate about</h2>
<p>If you love what you do and are fortunate enough to get to do that regularly, especially as a full time career then you've hit the jackpot.</p>
<p>However, I see a lot of people stuck in places and in roles that they just don't have the passion or drive for. I'm well aware that not everyone is fortunate enough to be able to pick and choose, but as developers we have long held a valuable position in the job market where there are more jobs than there are developers.</p>
<p>But this is really about having a truthful discussion with your inner dev and being both honest about what you <em>really</em> enjoy doing/not doing, and realistic about how to start a role doing this.</p>
<p>For example, if you really really really don't like PHP, then take care when interviewing or seeking out roles in development agencies where WordPress is heavily featured.</p>
<p>This advice is especially true for those seeking, perhaps, their first development roles. Be honest and candid about what's right for you and (if you're able to), don't just jump at the first opportunity that comes your way.</p>
<p>The more you can discover what direction you want to travel, the better aligned you'll be down the line in your career.</p>
<p>With all of the above said, please don't put pressure on yourself to decide too early. Sometimes you have to experience what you <em>don't</em> want to know what <em>is</em> right for you.</p>
<h2>Get a coding mentor</h2>
<p>I was supremely fortunate to have worked with some amazing developers back when I started. They were experienced, knowledgable, helpful and humble and really took me under their wing. I'll never be able to thank them enough.</p>
<p>Therefore, I'd highly recommend getting yourself a mentor to help with your development journey.</p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f095de9a3d4e32487247b46342959b1cc2f8e9d1/3c273/img/people-2569234_640.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This is different from a teacher or tutor (although there is overlap at the edges of the roles): a mentor is a guiding light to help give you focus and direction, to answer questions and point you along the right path for your particular journey.</p>
<p>I'd recommend taking a look at <a href="https://codingcoach.io/" title="Coding Coach website">Coding Coach</a> or my very own <a href="https://robkendal.co.uk/mentorship" title="Rob Kendal coding mentorship programmes">mentorship programmes</a> to find a mentor that's right for you.</p>
<h2>Mentor others</h2>
<p>Following on from the last point, you too can be a mentor and again, you don't have to have coded for decades or be an absolute expert.</p>
<p>Think about where you are on your journey and how far you've come. Even if you're 6-8 months into learning to code, there are people only 1-2 <em>weeks</em> into theirs; these are the people you can definitely help out.</p>
<p>That said, if you <em>are</em> quite experienced, then all the more reason to help someone else who's just starting out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Become the guide you wish you'd had when you started</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's rewarding beyond measure, and a win win situation: someone getting started is helped and guided, and you learn so much in the process, believe me.</p>
<h2>You don't get what you don't ask for</h2>
<p>I'm from Yorkshire in the UK and there's a saying in this North East part of the world: Shy bairns get nowt.</p>
<p>In essence we're really saying that 'you get nothing by keeping quiet'.</p>
<p>It's easy to look at seemingly successful developers and popular Twitter personas and assume that everyone has lucky breaks and opportunity just falls from the sky.</p>
<p>To be honest, this does happen to a small number of people, but most of the successful people you'll know are a combination of trying (a lot), keeping their eyes open for opportunities and only a little sprinkle of luck.</p>
<p>Most of the time it's about asking for what you want. Now I'm not suggesting you just go kicking your boss' door in a demanding a raise, but in all seriousness, if you think you deserve a pay rise, prove it and then <em>ask for it</em>!</p>
<p>Want to switch up your career? Ask about training programs at your current workplace. Want to talk to someone on LinkedIn about their career? Ask them.</p>
<p>The worst that will happen is you get a 'no'. In which case, time to move on and try something else.</p>
<h2>Keep track of all your wins</h2>
<p>This is a big one for me. It's very easy as a human to skew towards the negative. Even if you've just launched five features on a product used by millions, I would bet that it's that single tiny error that happened that you'll be thinking about, right?!</p>
<p>I keep a notebook of little victories and compliments I've received and look through them from time to time, especially when the <a href="https://robkendal.co.uk/blog/2019-05-10-fighting-imposter-syndrome-as-a-developer" title="Fighting imposter syndrome as a developer">imposter syndrome</a> kicks in from time to time.</p>
<p>It's not about ego or vanity, but it's about celebrating your victories and remembering how far you've come.</p>
<h2>You don't have to know everything</h2>
<p>The world of deveopment is HUGE. I mean seriously almost infinite. Between languages, frameworks, patterns, platforms, frontend, backend, the list goes on.</p>
<p>When you're starting out there can be an overwhelming urge to have to know everything all at once. But I'm here to tell you that you don't need to know everything and, in reality, you can't or won't ever know it all q-- the landscape is just too vast.</p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3f6e59a451413441a9a9f410a3dd2bf527cf301f/b6003/img/magic-cube-1976725_640.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Of course, as a frontend developer starting out, I'd recommend focussing on the three core pillars of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but once you're getting into the swing of things, start to add bits and pieces to your knowledge depending on what takes your fancy.</p>
<h2>Senior doesn't mean encylopedia</h2>
<p>Just because someone is a senior developer or an architect or principle, or has been programming for 100's of years, does not automatically make them the all knowing beasts you think they may be.</p>
<p>I'll let you into a secret: I've been developing in a fullstack fashion for over fifteen years and I still have to look up some of the most trivial snippets of code; I still miss semicolons out of things and I still make mistakes.</p>
<p>Sure, I know a lot about a lot, but there's oceans of knowledge I haven't even sailed upon. Just because people have been around the block doesn't directly equate to an infallible, all-knowing knowledge. Neither does it mean they're always automatically right or know better.</p>
<p>The point I'm driving at here is that just because you're less experienced or starting out doesn't mean your ideas are less valuable or that you have less to contribute.</p>
<p>It's also why adopting a life long approach to learning is so important as a developer.</p>
<h2>Titles don't really mean much in the long run</h2>
<p>Another thing to bear in mind is that some people get caught up in a title race and it's easy to think that becoming a 'principle developer' or 'lead architect' is the end goal. Yes, titles and recognition are nice and there's money and rewards that come with more senior titles, but they don't always reflect the abilities of the holder nor</p>
<p>I'm not saying that it's not OK to have 'become a lead developer' as a goal, but don't set your standards by the titles that you, or others, hold. It's your attitude, actions, and what you contribute to the development community that will ultimately shape your legacy.</p>
<h2>Networking is essential!!</h2>
<p>It really is <em>who you know</em> not always <em>what you know</em>.</p>
<p>I wish I'd spent more time making connections with other developers, recruiters, leaders, and makers …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>As Bitcoin approaches a new price record after 3 years delay a new wave of its popularity and advertisement is expected. In such waves all the risks, downsides, pitfalls are usually hidden and the bright future is pleasantly described. I want to highlight all those dark corners and also to give my view of this field.</p>

<h3 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>

<p>As the first decentralized digital currency Bitcoin’s main purpose was to serve as a digital money service that requires no trust in a central authority, and that will be free from control. But with an extreme raise of its value it gained another purpose — as an investment asset. Current data suggests that the second purpose greatly supersedes the original one.</p>

<p>In accordance with those two purposes, we’ll consider two types of downsides and risks — technical and economical.</p>

<h3 id="technical-downsides"><strong>Technical downsides</strong></h3>

<p>Two main technical downsides of Bitcoin are inefficiency and limited scalability.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption/">Bitcoin energy consumption index</a>, as of the time of writing, one single transaction consumes 700 kWh of energy, a huge waste. And this consumption will only increase with the growth of the network.</p>

<p>But increasing energy consumption isn’t the biggest problem since the growth of the total number of transactions is limited due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_scalability_problem">Bitcoin scalability problem</a>. It is estimated that the whole Bitcoin throughput can’t be more than 7 transactions per second on average. This is the dead-end for its original purpose.</p>

<p>While the absolute majority of other cryptocurrencies are useless imitators or straight-up scams, some of them indeed have slight improvements or useful extensions. It’s hard to create something perfect from the first shot, after all. Technology advancement is an evolutionary process.</p>

<p>I find this risk the most important — an emergence of a novel cryptocurrency that will contain a critical mass of improvements and extensions. Or, it could be just decent cryptocurrency, but backed by strong financial institutions (though it’s unlikely that some government will ever release a truly decentralized currency).</p>

<h3 id="economic-picture"><strong>Economic picture</strong></h3>

<p>Bitcoin proponents will argue that technical limitations are not an issue. They like to compare Bitcoin with gold, and gold isn’t transporting on the left and right. What they don’t say is that gold is a <em>natural</em> resource that has a lot of different uses in electronics, medicine, or even in food. Also, it’s naturally hard to obtain, it’s produced only in rare cosmic events, like supernova explosions or neutron stars collisions. And what is Bitcoin without its original purpose?</p>

<p>Well, it’s certainly a masterpiece, the first of a kind. But in this perspective it’s comparable with works of arts. They also have value, but no particular, instrumental purpose.</p>

<p>Thus, Bitcoin value will be pure speculation in the future with more advanced technologies. But in its current price there is also a huge amount of speculation. With no doubt the majority of people “invest” in Bitcoin just to raise a fortune, not to use it as payment. Though, I wouldn’t call it an investment. A typical investment is supposed to be spent on the production of new value. But no new value is produced when you buy Bitcoin. This is why it looks just like a financial pyramid — newcomers are the only reason for the price growth.</p>

<h3 id="a-huge-oxymoron"><strong>A huge oxymoron</strong></h3>

<p>Finally, I want to address the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p>

<p>Despite imperfections, Bitcoin was built with great ideals in mind.
Decentralization and freedom are the values that humankind must pursue, I believe.</p>

<p>But the ecosystem that arose around Bitcoin is mostly ignorant of those ideals.</p>

<p><strong><em>Exchanges</em></strong></p>

<p>A huge part of the cryptocurrency world is the exchanges. 
But they are centralized! They are in control of your funds. You have to trust them. So there is no difference with an ordinary financial institution. Well, actually, there is. A cryptocurrency exchange found on the internet can be run by a high-school kid just for fun.</p>

<p>Exchanges possess a great value in cryptocurrencies and are responsible for a big part of all Bitcoin transactions. They are entities that have the power and resources to play with the market.</p>

<p>The problem of exchanges can’t be solved since truly decentralized exchanges are impossible or impractical.</p>

<p><strong><em>Mining pools</em></strong></p>

<p>A mining pool is a clever way to unite the computational resources needed for mining new blocks. But again, they are centralized and as a single miner you have to trust them. There are pools that require no trust in a coordinator, but they don’t propose additional incentives for a single miner.</p>

<p>A dozen mining pools generate around 75% of new Bitcoin blocks according to <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/charts/pools">these stats</a>. Control them — and you can control the network. Note that big exchanges have their own mining pools. Yeah, decentralization…</p>

<p><strong><em>Mixers</em></strong></p>

<p>Bitcoin mixer is a way to hide a transaction sender and receiver. The story is the same as with exchanges and pools. They are centralized in nature and this can’t be solved.</p>

<p><strong><em>Stable cryptocurrencies</em></strong></p>

<p>This is the most ridiculous part and the best indicator of all of this farce. For me “stable cryptocurrency” is just an oxymoron. Operators of such mimic currencies are not only centralized and you have to trust them — they do not even comply with the laws of countries that print original currencies. They are worse than ordinary banks.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">coinmarketcap</a>, Tether, a USD mimic, is in the third place by a total market value and largely exceeds Bitcoin in transactions volume. A clusterfuck in the world of cryptocurrencies, in my opinion. Decentralization? What decentralization?</p>

<h3 id="the-future"><strong>The future</strong></h3>

<p>While I’m a big proponent of decentralization, I don’t believe in the longtime future of Bitcoin. The only reason for its future survival is the respect of its users. I have no idea what price it can achieve, but I’m 100% sure the price will have a speculative nature.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine has been theorized to provide protection against COVID-19. In a new study published in mBio, an open-access journal of the American Society for Microbiology researchers provide further proof of this theory.</p><div id="text">
<p>Researches have shown, in new study <a href="https://mbio.asm.org/content/11/6/e02628-20">published in mBio</a>, that mumps IgG titers, or levels of IgG antibody, are inversely <strong>correlated</strong> with severity in recovered COVID-19 patients previously vaccinated with the MMR II vaccine produced by Merck. MMR II contains the <strong>Edmonston strain of measles</strong>, the Jeryl Lynn (B-level) strain of mumps, and the Wistar RA 27/3 strain of rubella.</p>
<p>"We found a statistically significant inverse correlation between mumps titer levels and COVID-19 severity in people under age 42 <strong>who have had MMR II vaccinations</strong>," said lead study author Jeffrey E. Gold, president of World Organization, in Watkinsville, Georgia. "This adds to other associations demonstrating that <strong>the MMR vaccine may be protective against COVID-19</strong>. It also may explain why children have a much lower COVID-19 case rate than adults, as well as a much lower death rate. The majority of children get their first MMR vaccination around 12 to 15 months of age and a second one from 4 to 6 years of age."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We found a statistically significant inverse correlation between mumps titer levels and COVID-19 severity in people under age 42 who have had MMR II vaccinations</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the new study, the researchers divided 80 subjects into 2 groups. The MMR II group consisted of 50 U.S. born subjects who would primarily <strong>have MMR antibodies from the MMR II vaccine</strong>. A comparison group of 30 subjects had no record of MMR II vaccinations, and would primarily have MMR antibodies from other sources, including prior measles, mumps, and/or rubella illnesses. The researchers found a significant inverse correlation (rs = -0.71, P &lt; 0.001) between mumps titers and COVID-19 severity within the MMR II group. There were no significant correlations between mumps titers and disease severity in the comparison group, between mumps titers and age in the MMR II group, or between severity and measles or rubella titers in either group.</p>
<p>Within the MMR II group, mumps titers of 134 to 300 AU/ml (n=8) were only found in those who were functionally immune or asymptomatic. All with mild COVID-19 symptoms had mumps titers below 134 AU/ml (n=17). All with moderate symptoms had mumps titers below 75 AU/ml (n=11). All who had been hospitalized and required oxygen had mumps titers below 32 AU/ml (n=5). Titers were measured by Quest Diagnostics using their standard diagnostic protocol.</p>
<p>"This is the <strong>first immunological study</strong> to evaluate the relationship between the MMR II vaccine and COVID-19. The statistically significant inverse correlation between mumps titers and COVID-19 indicates that there is a relationship involved that warrants further investigation," said coauthor David J. Hurley, PhD, professor and molecular microbiologist at the University of Georgia. "The MMR II vaccine is considered a safe vaccine with very few side effects. If it has the ultimate benefit of preventing infection from COVID-19, preventing the spread of COVID-19, reducing the severity of it, or a combination of any or all of those, it is a very high reward low risk ratio intervention. Maximum seropositivity is achieved through two vaccinations at least 28 days apart. Based upon our study, it would be prudent to vaccinate those over 40 regardless of whether or not they already have high serum MMR titers."</p>

<p>The <a href="https://asm.org/">American Society for Microbiology</a> is one of the largest professional societies dedicated to the life sciences and is composed of 30,000 scientists and health practitioners. ASM's mission is to promote and advance the microbial sciences.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf">eqaf</a>, a constant-time compare function implementation in <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>, is a great case to demonstrate the <a href="https://signalsandthreads.com/language-design/#0008401">predictable performance of OCaml’s compiler</a>. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>The goal of a constant-time compare function is to avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack">timing attacks</a>, which requires fully deterministic and predictable runtime performance.</li>
<li>Usually, cryptography functions are written in assembly to have total control of resulting binary and avoid unneeded optimization by the compiler.</li>
<li>However, <a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf">eqaf</a> showed us that you can write clean OCaml and get simple and predictable resulting assembly.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>This is the first issue of <a href="https://learnocamlthehardway.substack.com/welcome">Learn OCaml the Hard Way</a>. A publication about learning OCaml from the ground up.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="about-garbage-collection">About Garbage Collection</h2>
<p>It’s hard to have a stable runtime performance for languages that comes with a garbage collector. To have a predictable runtime performance characteristic in these languages, the following rules are usually required to be followed religiously:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid garbage collections by avoiding memory allocations.</li>
<li>Avoid boxed values to generate assembly as low-level as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, the resulting code are usually unidiomatic and hard to maintain.</p>
<h2 id="compiler-explorer">Compiler Explorer</h2>
<p><a href="https://godbolt.org/">Compiler Explorer</a> is a handy tool for exploring compilers and its assembly output. It has built-in OCaml support and removes boilerplate automatically. I recommend you to test the following example with it.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="code">Code</h2>
<p>Here’s the implementation of <code>eqaf</code>’s <code>equal</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ocaml"><span>let</span><span>[@</span>inline<span>]</span> get x i <span>=</span> String.unsafe_get x i <span>|&gt;</span> Char.code

  <span>for</span> <span>_</span> <span>=</span> 1 <span>to</span> ln <span>land</span> 1 <span>do</span> r <span>:=</span> <span>!</span>r <span>lor</span> <span>(</span>get a <span>(</span>ln <span>-</span> 1<span>)</span> <span>lxor</span> get b <span>(</span>ln <span>-</span> 1<span>))</span> <span>done</span> <span>;</span>
  <span>!</span>r <span>=</span> 0

<span>let</span> equal a b <span>=</span>
  <span>let</span> al <span>=</span> String.length a <span>in</span>
  <span>let</span> bl <span>=</span> String.length b <span>in</span>
  <span>if</span> al <span>&lt;&gt;</span> bl
  <span>then</span> false
  <span>else</span> equal <span>~</span>ln<span>:</span>al a b
</code></pre></div><p>Besides basic OCaml syntaxes[1], interesting bits in the example are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can force OCaml to always inline a function via adding an attribute <code>[@inline]</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>String.unsafe_get</code> works like <code>String.get</code> but without bound-checking. It’s unsafe for most use-cases but it’s used here to <a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf/blob/master/lib/eqaf.ml#L3">avoid jumping to exception</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OCaml provides a FFI <code>external</code> for <a href="https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/intfc.html">interfacing with C</a>. Here we use it to call a primitive function provided by OCaml’s runtime <code>%caml_string_get16u</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>external</code> is always unsafe and should be really take care about.</li>
<li>Primitives are not stable. For example: <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-base64/pull/36">https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-base64/pull/36</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>n asr m</code> shifts <code>n</code> to the right by <code>m</code> bits. This is an arithmetic shift: the sign bit of <code>n</code> is replicated. The result is unspecified if <code>m &lt; 0</code> or <code>m &gt; Sys.int_size</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ref</code> creates a <a href="https://dev.realworldocaml.org/imperative-programming.html">reference cell</a> and allows in-place replacement with <code>:=</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>pred x</code> is <code>x - 1</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>lor</code>, <code>lxor</code>, and <code>land</code> are logical bit-wise <code>or</code>, <code>xor</code>, and <code>and</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the OCaml code is quite low-level (and not very functional). It’s still cleaner than most constant-time compare functions implemented in assembly.</p>
<h2 id="read-the-asm">Read the asm</h2>
<p>Here’s the resulting assembly of the previous example, copied from the <code>eqaf</code> <a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf/blob/master/lib/eqaf.ml">source</a>. You can get the same output via <a href="https://godbolt.org/">Compiler Explorer</a>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p><code>eqaf</code> allows us to have a basic understanding about OCaml’s assembly output without inferences of GC, boxed values, and advanced syntaxes such as pattern matching. We will explore more in the future issues.</p>

<p>The Postgres.ai team is proud to announce version 2.0 of Database Lab Engine (DLE) for PostgreSQL, a modern database tool for building powerful development and testing environments based on <a href="https://postgres.ai/docs/questions-and-answers#what-is-thin-cloning-thin-vs-thick-clones">thin cloning</a>. Using Database Lab API or CLI (and if you are using Database Lab SaaS, GUI), on a single machine with, say, a 1 TiB disk, you can easily create and destroy dozens of database copies of size 1 TiB each. All these copies are independently modifiable and created/destroyed in just a few seconds. This can become a game-changer in your development and testing workflow, improving time-to-market, and reducing costs of your non-production infrastructure.</p>
<p>This release continues our strategy to automate all routine tasks such as initialization of the PostgreSQL data directory, data transformation, and snapshot management. In DLE 2.0, all these tasks can be flexibly configured in a single configuration file. As a result, building dev&amp;test environments for projects with many databases (such as those that adopted microservice architecture) becomes much easier.</p>
<p>The previous versions of the Database Lab introduced the core technology: thin clone provisioning, based on either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS">ZFS</a> (default) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Volume_Manager_(Linux)">LVM</a>. It was already possible to provision full-sized multi-terabyte database clones in just a few seconds and use them for a broad spectrum of tasks such as database schema changes verification, SQL query analysis, or general application testing.</p>
<p>Version 2.0 speeds up and empowers the initialization of DLE itself. Instead of using custom scripts for initial and continuous data retrieval, it is now possible to configure everything in a declarative manner to get the data and be up and running.</p>
<h2 id="updates-in-dle-2-0">Updates in DLE 2.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>Automated data retrieval: specify the source and the method of initializing the data directory and how it is to be updated</li>
<li>Both physical (pg_basebackup, WAL-G, more) and logical methods (dump/restore, Amazon RDS, Heroku Postgres, more) are supported (see the guide <a href="https://postgres.ai/docs/guides/data">Database Lab Engine data sources</a>)</li>
<li>Any managed cloud PostgreSQL offering is now supported, with additional features for Amazon RDS (see <a href="https://postgres.ai/docs/tutorials/database-lab-tutorial-amazon-rds">DLE tutorial for Amazon RDS</a> and the guide <a href="https://postgres.ai/docs/guides/data/rds">Data source: AWS RDS</a>)</li>
<li>For continuously updated physically initialized data directory (which effectively makes your DLE a specialized replica), snapshot management is fully automated: snapshots are created and destroyed based on the schedule defined in the configuration file (see the reference <a href="https://postgres.ai/docs/database-lab/config-reference#job-physicalsnapshot">Job physicalSnapshot</a>)</li>
<li>Basic data transformation and masking supported: specify any custom script that will be applied each time a new snapshot is prepared (option <code>preprocessingScript</code> in both <code>logicalSnapshot</code> and <code>physicalSnapshot</code> jobs, see the <a href="https://postgres.ai/docs/database-lab/config-reference">Configuration reference</a>)</li>
<li>License changed to <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html">AGPLv3</a></li>
<li>The documentation is significantly extended: 3 tutorials, 26 user guides, 6 references, and counting: <a href="https://postgres.ai/docs">http://postgres.ai/docs</a></li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div>
      

      <p>
        WireGuard has gained traction over the past few years due, in part, to its high performance. We wondered how fast it really is, and realized that since we're already tracking VPN performance metrics for our <a href="https://vpnintel.com/unit-prices">VPN unit price index</a>, we could use the same data to answer the question, <strong>"how much faster is WireGuard than OpenVPN?"</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        We focused on Windscribe, Mullvad, and NordVPN, three providers that support both WireGuard and OpenVPN, and built a <a href="https://vpnintel.com/wireguard-vs-openvpn">dashboard</a> to visualize their comparative download speeds. We've embedded the charts for the week ending November 20, 2020 below along with some commentary.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that all data on this page represent speedtests between U.S.-based speedtest servers and VPNs. Our methodology section below has more on this.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      <h2>Windscribe</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
      For the week ending November 20, 2020, Windscribe's average download speed over OpenVPN was <span>134 Mbps</span> and its average download speed over WireGuard was <span>363 Mbps</span>. This means that by simply toggling the WireGuard option, Windscribe users can get a free 2.7x speed boost!
    </p>
    <p><img src="https://vpnintel.com/assets/news-dfd25285653d0eb57e648315d449e97092408746e1412f7bc9b4ed13395df2ab.svg">
       As of November 24, 2020, our 7-day Windscribe averages are 339 Mbps for WireGuard and 144 Mbps for OpenVPN.
    </p>

    
    <p>
        Windscribe's Wireguard speeds are almost always in the 300-400 Mbps ranges. Dig deeper into performance and pricing info on our dedicated pages for <a href="https://vpnintel.com/windscribe-wireguard">Windscribe WireGuard</a> and <a href="https://vpnintel.com/windscribe">Windscribe OpenVPN</a>.
      </p>

    <p>
      <h2>Mullvad</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
      Mullvad was one of WireGuard's earliest commercial supporters. For the week ending November 20, 2020, Mullvad's average download speed over OpenVPN was <span>258 Mbps</span> and its average download speed over WireGuard was <span>672 Mbps</span> – a free 2.6x performance boost for Mullvad's WireGuard users!
    </p>
    <p><img src="https://vpnintel.com/assets/news-dfd25285653d0eb57e648315d449e97092408746e1412f7bc9b4ed13395df2ab.svg">
       As of November 24, 2020, our 7-day Mullvad averages are 675 Mbps for WireGuard and 273 Mbps for OpenVPN.
    </p>

    
    <p>
        Mullvad's WireGuard speeds consistently land in the 600-700 Mbps range. Take a closer look at the pricing and performance data on our dedicated pages for <a href="https://vpnintel.com/mullvad">Mullvad WireGuard</a> and <a href="https://vpnintel.com/mullvad-openvpn">Mullvad OpenVPN</a>.
      </p>

    <p>
      <h2>NordVPN</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
        NordVPN launched support for WireGuard via its NordLynx product in Spring 2020. For the week ending November 20, 2020, Mullvad's average download speed over OpenVPN was <span>395 Mbps</span>. If the only number you remember from this page is NordVPN's average WireGuard download speed, you'll have the idea: a ridiculously fast <span>777 Mbps</span>, a 1.9x boost over its OpenVPN service.
      </p>
    <p><img src="https://vpnintel.com/assets/news-dfd25285653d0eb57e648315d449e97092408746e1412f7bc9b4ed13395df2ab.svg">
       As of November 24, 2020, our 7-day NordVPN averages are 778 Mbps for WireGuard and 416 Mbps for OpenVPN.
    </p>

    
    <p>
        You can see that NordVPN actually exceeds gigabit speeds on occasion. Its WireGuard speeds have a bit more variance than the other providers, but is uniformly well above 500 Mbps. For a deeper dive into NordLynx pricing and performance, check out our dedicated pages for <a href="https://vpnintel.com/nordvpn-wireguard">NordVPN WireGuard/NordLynx</a> and <a href="https://vpnintel.com/nordvpn">NordVPN OpenVPN</a>.
      </p>

    <p>
      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
    </p>
    <div>
      <p>
        For the week ending November 20, 2020, our global average download speed over OpenVPN was <span>251 Mbps</span> and <span>583 Mbps</span> over WireGuard – WireGuard outperformed OpenVPN by an incredible 230%!
      </p>
      <p>
        All the more incredible is that customers of these services get this speed boost for free simply by selecting the WireGuard option.
      </p>
      <p>
        NordVPN's 1.9x ratio is a little lower than the other providers', but it still has a massive raw speed advantage. If NordVPN can get its WireGuard speeds up to the 2.5x+ ratios held by Windscribe and Mullvad, then it will be consistently serving gigabit speeds.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's it for now! We think this stuff is interesting, so we'll probably make this a monthly or quarterly report. If you'd like to know when we launch new tools and publish reports like this, please join our newsletter:

       As of November 24, 2020, WireGuard clocks in at 597 Mbps to OpenVPN's 287 Mbps, a 2.1x speed boost.
    </p>

    <div>
      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>
        Our system is fully automated which lets us take thousands of readings a day. The data on this page represents speedtests conducted between servers based in the U.S. and VPN servers also based in the U.S. – the speeds shown here are likely to be faster than what you would experience at home.
      </p>

      <p>
        All speedtests are done over UDP with the native OpenVPN and WireGuard Linux clients except for NordVPN's NordLynx/WireGuard service which uses the NordVPN Linux client since NordVPN does not provide WireGuard configuration files.
      </p>

      <p>
        At least as of November 20, 2020, you'll see some lumps shared across the three charts which may reflect resource usage patterns for our own hosting provider. We will report back on this.

          <a name="topofpage"></a>
          <p>Throughout my career, I’ve developed some <em>opinions</em>. Some have worn particularly deep ruts,
reinforced by years of experience. I tried to figure out what these
had in common, and it’s
the idea that <strong>code in production is the only code that matters</strong>. Staging doesn’t
matter, code on your laptop doesn’t matter, QA doesn’t matter,
only production matters. Everything else is debt.</p>

<p>This perspective probably comes from years sitting in between
operations and product development. I strongly
believe that teams should optimize for getting code to production as quickly as
possible as well as responding to incidents in production.</p>

<p>This idea, and a lot of the practices it implies, can be
counter-intuitive or controversial, so I want to dive into them a little
further. What follows is a set of practices and principles I believe are true,
considering my underlying belief that code working in production is the only
code that matters.</p>

<h2 id="engineers-should-operate-their-code">1. Engineers should operate their code.</h2>

<p><strong>Engineers are the subject matter experts for the code they write and should be
responsible for operating it in production</strong>. In this context, “operating” means
deploying, instrumenting, and monitoring code as well as helping to resolve
incidents related to or impacting that code. The responsibility of operating
code aligns incentives - it encourages engineers to write code that is
observable and easy to debug, and connects them to what customers really care
about. It encourages them to be curious about how their code is performing in
production. Importantly, engineers should be on-call for their code - being
on-call creates a positive feedback loop and makes it easier to know if their
efforts in writing production-ready code are paying off. I’ve heard people
complain about the prospect of being on-call, so I’ll just ask this: if you’re
not on-call for your code, who is?</p>

<p>If you’re not currently on-call for your code but want to be, and can help
influence this decision, there are some things you can do. Set up PagerDuty (or
similar) schedules for each group of engineers responsible for specific
services or parts of your code. A good schedule has 6–8 engineers. There are
plenty of variations, but a typical template is to have one-week rotations,
where you’ll be on-call for secondary for a week and then primary for a week.
Configuring alerts is a separate topic, which probably deserves it’s own blog
post entirely, but focus on things that impact your customers (see:
Symptom-based alerting) and remember that you’re ultimately responsible for how
you respond to alerts, which means you can change them.</p>

<p>There are two talks I’d recommend watching that touch on the topic of
configuring alerts: Liz Fong-Jones talks about SLOs in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4jbUzEVL0">Cultivating Production Excellence</a> and Aditya Mukerjee does a great job talking about techniques for
managing alerts in <a href="https://vimeo.com/274820572">Warning: This Talk Contains Content Known to the State of California to Reduce Alert Fatigue</a>.</p>

<h2 id="buy-almost-always-beatsbuild">2. Buy Almost Always Beats&nbsp;Build</h2>

<p><strong>If you can avoid building something, you should.</strong> Code is the most expensive
way to solve a problem that isn’t addressing a core area of your business. For
most small to mid-sized companies, there are open source or better yet, hosted
solutions that solve a wide range of common problems. I mean things like git
repository hosting (Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc), observability tooling
(Honeycomb, Lightstep, etc), managed databases (Amazon RDS, Confluent Kafka,
etc), alerting (PagerDuty, OpsGenie, etc) and a whole host of other commodity
technologies. This even applies to your infrastructure - if you can help
it, don’t roll your own Kubernetes clusters (side note: do you even need to use
Kubernetes?), don’t roll your own load balancers if you can use Amazon ELB or
ALBs.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">NIH</a> syndrome is very real and some companies get burned badly by
this. I’ve seen teams light time and money on fire reinventing components when
better, more battle-tested alternatives exist in the market. Those same teams
almost always end up spending years contending with the resulting technical
debt. If you’re on such a team and have the will and ability to impact change,
start rolling back these decisions one by one. Migrate your databases to a
managed provider, migrate your feature flagging system to a SaaS tool (i.e.
LaunchDarkly). Keep going until the only software you maintain yourselves is
the software that delivers value to your customers. You’ll be much, much better
off for it.</p>

<h2 id="make-deployseasy">3. Make Deploys&nbsp;Easy</h2>

<p>Deploying should be a frequent and unexciting activity. <strong>Engineers should be
able to deploy with minimal manual steps and it should be easy to see if the
deploy is successful</strong> (this requires instrumenting your code for observability,
which - tada - is covered above), and it should be easy to roll back a deploy
if something doesn’t go well. Deploying frequently implies that
deploys are smaller, and smaller deploys are generally easier, faster and
safer.</p>

<p>Many teams implement periods where deploys are forbidden - these can be
referred to as code freezes, or deploy policies like “Don’t deploy on Fridays”.
Having such blackout periods can lead to a pile-up of changes, which increases
the overall risk of something going very wrong.</p>

<p>If you’re on a team that fears deploys, dedicate a percentage of your
engineering time to improvements in your deployment pipeline until the fear is
gone. On a recent team I worked with, we were able to improve deploy times from
3 hours to 30 minutes, which drastically improved the teams’ confidence in the
deploy process. A natural side effect of this was that engineers started
deploying much more frequently instead of waiting for changes to pile up enough
to warrant a “release” (which was synonymous with a deploy).</p>

<p>The book
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339">Accelerate</a>
has been getting a lot of attention. If you haven’t read it, I’d recommend it.
The team behind it also publishes the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/devops/">State of DevOps</a>
reports, which are full of well-researched information about what various
companies in the industry are doing. It’s not a coincidence that two of the
four key metrics that the book focuses on are directly related to this (Deploy
Frequency, Change Lead Time). Shipping is <a href="https://www.heavybit.com/library/podcasts/o11ycast/ep-12-speed-of-deployment-with-rich-archbold-of-intercom/">your company’s heartbeat</a>.</p>

<h2 id="trust-the-people-closest-to-theknives">4. Trust the People Closest to the&nbsp;Knives</h2>

<p><strong>The people who work with a system are the ones who understand it best.</strong> This
applies to any part of the socio-technical systems within which we all work. In
the case of software systems, the engineers who deploy every day and are
on-call for critical services understand the level of risk they operate in. A
sad trend is that managers tend to overestimate their teams’ progress on
certain transitions - i.e. cloud-native, DevOps, etc. The higher up the
management chain, the larger this overestimation tends to be. Engineers who
deploy and get paged when things break know where the bodies are buried and
they know what needs the most work. They should, therefore, be the primary
stakeholders responsible for prioritizing technical work.</p>

<p>Another manifestation of this principle applies to platform or services teams.
If you’re responsible for building some shared component that’s used within
your organization (i.e. a messaging system, ci/cd infrastructure, shared
libraries or services) there’s an uncomfortable truth lurking for you: the
people who use your work know more about it than you do in many cases. They
understand implicitly how it serves customers and they know what contortions or
hoops they have to jump through to get it to work. Listen to them for
clues on how to improve the UX of your services and tools.</p>

<h2 id="qa-gates-make-qualityworse">5. QA Gates Make Quality&nbsp;Worse</h2>

<p>Many teams have a manual QA step that gets performed before deploys. The idea,
I guess, is to have someone run automated or manual tests to verify that a set
of changes are ready to be released. This sounds like a comforting
idea - having a human being (or team of human beings) “verify” a release before
it goes out - <strong>but it falls victim to several false assumptions and creates
some misalignments that do more harm than good.</strong></p>

<p>First of all, if there’s manual work that needs to be done before a deploy can
go out, that creates a bottleneck - if you’re making deploys easy, and
deploying small changes frequently, no QA team is going to be able to keep up
testing every deploy, and will inevitably block teams from deploying. That’s no
good. If you have manual tests, automate them and build them into your CI
pipeline (if they do deliver value).</p>

<p>Secondly, the teams doing QA often lack context and are under time pressure.
They may end up testing “effects” instead of “intents”. For example, I’ve seen
QA teams burn time testing that when something happens in a UI, something
related happens in a database. What happens when an engineer refactors that UI
component and changes the underlying data model? The functionality works, but
the test breaks. Because two teams are involved, this takes coordination and
time to fix. Similarly, I’ve seen QA teams block deploys because of failing
tests when caching was introduced at the CDN layer - a TTL of 5 seconds on an
activity feed may not ever be noticed by a user but it might break QA tests
causing unnecessary conflicts between product and QA engineers.</p>

<p>Luckily, solving this one is easy. Instead of having a dedicated QA team work
on creating manual and automated test cases that run in a fictitious QA
environment, reassign that team to work on continuous testing in production.
Instead of being a gate for deploys, a QA team could continuously verify that
production is working as expected. QA teams are also well situated to lead
Chaos Engineering initiatives, where faults are intentionally injected in
production. QA engineers could also work on making the CI/CD pipeline more
reliable, so that deploys are no longer a nightmare.</p>

<p>I was reading another engineer’s story this week about <a href="https://www.philosophicalhacker.com/post/data-point-for-job-seeking-devs">his 65-day job hunt</a>. I’ve avoided traditional job applications and interviews since I graduated from college, but a few things struck me from this post:</p>
<ol>
<li>Instead of targeting <em>every</em> job, Matt Dupree selectively applied at <strong>only 16 companies</strong> and withdrew applications when he thought the company was a bad fit. I love this advice.</li>
<li>Matt has built side projects, spoken at conferences, and blogged consistently for years. <strong>He walked into interviews with a trust level much higher than random applicants.</strong> I have said this before: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/code-notenough-karl-l-hughes/">coding skills are not enough to build a resilient career</a>.</li>
<li>Technical interviews still tell employers very little about an engineer’s ability (that’s a <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/hiring-process">whole other blog post</a>).</li>
</ol>
<p>Not everyone has the luxury of choice when it comes to choosing their next job, but if you’re a software engineer, you should be able to get there. There’s more demand for our skillset than there is supply, but you have to be intentional if you want to build a resilient career.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-resilient-career">What is a “resilient career”?</h2>
<p>People with resilient careers don’t fear an economic downturn because they have been able to put a little money aside. They don’t fear losing their job because they probably have half a dozen offers they’ve declined in the past year. They don’t stress about financial concerns because they likely have one or two side hustles bringing in a little extra cash flow.</p>
<p>I mentioned at the top that I’ve haven’t applied for a job since college. Skipping this step in the job search has been possible because I’ve approached my career very differently from most software engineers. Here are my rules for creating a resilient career:</p>
<h3 id="1-only-work-for-companies-that-need-and-trust-you">1. Only work for companies that need and trust you</h3>
<p>I skipped the job application process with all three of my jobs since college by doing the work that companies wanted before I officially started working for them.</p>
<p>No, I don’t mean you should work for free. Here’s how it played out for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uloop hired me to start their blog because I spent my free time in college building a blog, recruiting writers, and learning to code. I worked as a contractor for Uloop while I finished college, and when I graduated, bringing me on full-time just meant signing a W2.</li>
<li>Packback hired me because I stayed in touch with the founder for about nine months before they had any funding. When they were looking to hire a full-time engineer, they gave me a project from their roadmap. I did it as a freelancer, then joined full-time after I turned it in.</li>
<li>The Graide Network brought me on months after I started building a relationship with their founder. Instead of interviewing, I began as a consultant a couple of nights per week before they had the funding to bring me on.</li>
</ul>
<p>During each of these test periods, I got to see how much the company needed someone with my skill set, build trust with them, and get a trial run of the day-to-day. If I ever look for a job again, I’ll keep using the same approach because it works well.</p>
<h3 id="2-your-network-is-your-biggest-asset">2. Your network is your biggest asset</h3>
<p>You might also notice that two of my three of these career moves involved knowing my boss for months before joining. Notice that I didn’t run into them at a Meetup one night and get hired the next day.</p>
<p>For some reason, Engineers hear “you should network more,” and think that means they should go out and meet new people. That’s not how it works. Relationships take months or years to cultivate. You <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/the-key-to-networking-keeping-in-touch">have to stay in touch</a> if you ever want them to pay off.</p>
<p>Spend maybe 25% of your time meeting new people and 75% of your time staying in touch with people who you genuinely like. Personal relationships are founded on common interests, goals, or experiences, so find a mix of people who are both ahead of and behind you in your journey.</p>
<h3 id="3-cultivate-a-variety-of-interests-and-potential-revenue-generators">3. Cultivate a variety of interests and potential revenue generators</h3>
<p>I have always had a side project or two - mostly learning opportunities - but in the past three years, I’ve realized that you can generate revenue and build a network from them. Over the years, my side projects have led to consulting gigs, job offers, freelance opportunities, and a lot of high-quality connections around the world.</p>
<p>For example, CFP Land makes <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/cfp-land">a couple hundred dollars per month in profit</a>, which is fine, but the connections I’ve made from running it are worth orders of magnitude more. My previous side project, <a href="https://github.com/jobapis">Job APIs</a>, brings me multiple consulting offers per month (99% of them aren’t worth doing, but still, it’s nice to know they’re there).</p>
<p>My point is, anything I do in my free time is an investment in making my career more resilient.</p>
<h3 id="4-learn-on-your-employers-dime">4. Learn on your employer’s dime</h3>
<p>I was talking to a friend recently about his job search. He was lamenting that after five years of working hard for his employer and being let go, he was struggling to find another company that used the same tech stack.</p>
<p>“How much time did you spend learning new tools, libraries, or frameworks each week while you were at your prior job?” I asked.</p>
<p>“There wasn’t time for that,” he lamented, “We were always pushing to the max to get stuff done on time.”</p>
<p>It’s no surprise that my friend’s employer let him go. He wasn’t growing and when the company needed fewer resources in his engineering realm, he was too specialized to move into another area. He was seen as a resource that had to be let go. I used to think you could <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/be-indispensable">be indispensible</a> by being the best at one thing, but I’m starting to move away from that belief.</p>
<p>Any employer I work for gets me working ~35 hours per week on the projects we plan and ~5 hours per week learning new things. My value to my employer only increases as I become a more well-rounded engineer, so learning is non-negotiable. Now I bake this into my team’s weekly retrospectives - we share what we’re learning with each other - so we can hold each other accountable for learning new things.</p>
<h2 id="make-the-journey-your-own">Make the journey your own</h2>
<p>Finally, what works for me won’t necessarily work for you. My journey has involved working for early-stage startups - which you might hate - and being a software development generalist. Still, I think the fundamental goal should be the same: to build a resilient career.</p>

<p>This post is hard to write, both in the emotional sense but also in the “I would
have written a shorter letter, but I didn’t have the time” sense. Hence, please
assume the best of intentions when reading it—it is not my intention to make
anyone feel bad about their contributions, but rather to provide some insight
into why my frustration level ultimately exceeded the threshold.</p>

<p>Debian has been in my life for well over 10 years at this point.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I have visited some old friends at the Zürich Debian meetup
after a multi-year period of absence. On my bike ride home, it occurred to me
that the topics of our discussions had remarkable overlap with my last visit. We
had a discussion about the merits of systemd, which took a detour to respect in
open source communities, returned to processes in Debian and eventually
culminated in democracies and their theoretical/practical failings. Admittedly,
that last one might be a Swiss thing.</p>

<p>I say this not to knock on the Debian meetup, but because it prompted me to
reflect on what feelings Debian is invoking lately and whether it’s still a good
fit for me.</p>

<p>So I’m finally making a decision that I should have made a long time ago: I am
winding down my involvement in Debian to a minimum.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-this-mean">What does this mean?</h2>

<p>Over the coming weeks, I will:</p>

<ul>
<li>transition packages to be team-maintained where it makes sense</li>
<li>remove myself from the <code>Uploaders</code> field on packages with other maintainers</li>
<li>orphan packages where I am the sole maintainer</li>
</ul>

<p>I will try to keep up best-effort maintenance of the
<a href="https://manpages.debian.org/">manpages.debian.org</a> service and the
<a href="https://codesearch.debian.net/">codesearch.debian.net</a> service, but any help
would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>For all intents and purposes, please treat me as permanently on vacation. I will
try to be around for administrative issues (e.g. permission transfers) and
questions addressed directly to me, permitted they are easy enough to answer.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>When I joined Debian, I was still studying, i.e. I had luxurious amounts of
spare time. Now, over 5 years of full time work later, my day job taught me a
lot, both about what works in large software engineering projects and how I
personally like my computer systems. I am very conscious of how I spend the
little spare time that I have these days.</p>

<p>The following sections each deal with what I consider a major pain point, in no
particular order. Some of them influence each other—for example, if changes
worked better, we could have a chance at transitioning packages to be more
easily machine readable.</p>

<h3 id="change-process-in-debian">Change process in Debian</h3>

<p>The last few years, my current team at work conducted various smaller and larger
refactorings across the entire code base (touching thousands of projects), so we
have learnt a lot of valuable lessons about how to effectively do these
changes. It irks me that Debian works almost the opposite way in every regard. I
appreciate that every organization is different, but I think a lot of my points
do actually apply to Debian.</p>

<p>In Debian, packages are nudged in the right direction by a document called the
<a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/">Debian Policy</a>, or its programmatic
embodiment, lintian.</p>

<p>While it is great to have a lint tool (for quick, local/offline feedback), it is
even better to not require a lint tool at all. The team conducting the change
(e.g. the C++ team introduces a new hardening flag for all packages) should be
able to do their work transparent to me.</p>

<p>Instead, currently, all packages become lint-unclean, all maintainers need to
read up on what the new thing is, how it might break, whether/how it affects
them, manually run some tests, and finally decide to opt in. This causes a lot
of overhead and manually executed mechanical changes across packages.</p>

<p>Notably, the <strong>cost of each change</strong> is distributed onto the package maintainers in
the Debian model. At work, we have found that the opposite works better: if the
team behind the change is put in power to do the change for as many users as
possible, they can be significantly more efficient at it, which reduces the
total cost and time a lot. Of course, exceptions (e.g. a large project abusing a
language feature) should still be taken care of by the respective owners, but
the important bit is that the default should be the other way around.</p>

<p>Debian is <strong>lacking tooling for large changes</strong>: it is hard to programmatically
deal with packages and repositories (see the section below). The closest to
“sending out a change for review” is to open a bug report with an attached
patch. I thought the workflow for accepting a change from a bug report was too
complicated and started <a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2016-07-17-mergebot/">mergebot</a>, but only Guido
ever signaled interest in the project.</p>

<p>Culturally, reviews and reactions are slow. There are no deadlines. I literally
sometimes get emails notifying me that a patch I sent out a few years ago (!!)
is now merged. This turns projects from a small number of weeks into many years,
which is a huge demotivator for me.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, you can see artifacts of the slow online activity manifest
itself in the offline culture as well: I don’t want to be discussing systemd’s
merits 10 years after I first heard about it.</p>

<p>Lastly, changes can easily be slowed down significantly by holdouts who refuse
to collaborate. My canonical example for this is rsync, whose maintainer refused
my patches to make the package use debhelper purely out of personal preference.</p>

<p>Granting so much personal freedom to individual maintainers prevents us as a
project from raising the abstraction level for building Debian packages, which
in turn makes tooling harder.</p>

<p>How would things look like in a better world?</p>

<ol>
<li>As a project, we should strive towards more unification. Uniformity still
does not rule out experimentation, it just changes the trade-off from easier
experimentation and harder automation to harder experimentation and easier
automation.</li>
<li>Our culture needs to shift from “this package is my domain, how dare you
touch it” to a shared sense of ownership, where anyone in the project can
easily contribute (reviewed) changes without necessarily even involving
individual maintainers.</li>
</ol>

<p>To learn more about how successful large changes can look like, I recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrC6ROeV4GI">my
colleague Hyrum Wright’s talk “Large-Scale Changes at Google: Lessons Learned
From 5 Yrs of Mass Migrations”</a>.</p>

<h3 id="fragmented-workflow-and-infrastructure">Fragmented workflow and infrastructure</h3>

<p>Debian generally seems to prefer decentralized approaches over centralized
ones. For example, individual packages are maintained in separate repositories
(as opposed to in one repository), each repository can use any SCM (git and svn
are common ones) or no SCM at all, and each repository can be hosted on a
different site. Of course, what you do in such a repository also varies subtly
from team to team, and even within teams.</p>

<p>In practice, non-standard hosting options are used rarely enough to not justify
their cost, but frequently enough to be a huge pain when trying to automate
changes to packages. Instead of using GitLab’s API to create a merge request,
you have to design an entirely different, more complex system, which deals with
intermittently (or permanently!) unreachable repositories and abstracts away
differences in patch delivery (bug reports, merge requests, pull requests,
email, …).</p>

<p>Wildly diverging workflows is not just a temporary problem either. I
participated in long discussions about different git workflows during DebConf
13, and gather that there were similar discussions in the meantime.</p>

<p>Personally, I cannot keep enough details of the different workflows in my
head. Every time I touch a package that works differently than mine, it
frustrates me immensely to re-learn aspects of my day-to-day.</p>

<p>After noticing workflow fragmentation in the Go packaging team (which I
started), I tried fixing this with the <a href="https://go-team.pages.debian.net/workflow-changes.html">workflow changes
proposal</a>, but did not
succeed in implementing it. The lack of effective automation and slow pace of
changes in the surrounding tooling despite my willingness to contribute time and
energy killed any motivation I had.</p>

<h3 id="old-infrastructure-package-uploads">Old infrastructure: package uploads</h3>

<p>When you want to make a package available in Debian, you upload GPG-signed files
via anonymous FTP. There are several batch jobs (the queue daemon, <code>unchecked</code>,
<code>dinstall</code>, possibly others) which run on fixed schedules (e.g. <code>dinstall</code> runs
at 01:52 UTC, 07:52 UTC, 13:52 UTC and 19:52 UTC).</p>

<p>Depending on timing, I estimated that you might wait for over 7 hours (!!)
before your package is actually installable.</p>

<p>What’s worse for me is that feedback to your upload is asynchronous. I like to
do one thing, be done with it, move to the next thing. The current setup
requires a many-minute wait and costly task switch for no good technical
reason. You might think a few minutes aren’t a big deal, but when all the time I
can spend on Debian per day is measured in minutes, this makes a huge difference
in perceived productivity and fun.</p>

<p>The last communication I can find about speeding up this process is <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2008/12/msg00014.html">ganneff’s
post</a> from 2008.</p>

<p>How would things look like in a better world?</p>

<ol>
<li>Anonymous FTP would be replaced by a web service which ingests my package and
returns an authoritative accept or reject decision in its response.</li>
<li>For accepted packages, there would be a status page displaying the build
status and when the package will be available via the mirror network.</li>
<li>Packages should be available within a few minutes after the build completed.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="old-infrastructure-bug-tracker">Old infrastructure: bug tracker</h3>

<p>I dread interacting with the Debian bug
tracker. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debbugs">debbugs</a> is a piece of software
(from 1994) which is only used by Debian and the GNU project these days.</p>

<p>Debbugs processes emails, which is to say it is asynchronous and cumbersome to
deal with. Despite running on the fastest machines we …</p></div></div>

<p>
I don’t usually talk about money, but a friend asked me what it was like to get rich, and he wanted to know specifics, so I told him my story.
</p><p>
I had <a href="https://sive.rs/xn">a day job</a> in midtown Manhattan paying $20K per year — about minimum wage.
On weekends I would earn $150 per day performing circus shows for kids, though I’d spend about $50 in bus fare to get to the gigs.
I was sharing a three-bedroom apartment with two other roommates in Queens, so our rent was $333 per month each.
I made peanut butter sandwiches for three meals a day, and at night maybe some eggs.
I never ate out, and never took a taxi.
<strong>
My cost of living was about $1000/month, and I was earning $1800/month.
I did this for two years, and saved up $12,000.
</strong>
I was 22 years old.
</p><p>
Once I had $12,000 I could quit my job and become a full-time musician.
I knew I could get a few gigs per month to pay my cost of living.
So I was free.
<a href="https://sive.rs/nq">I quit my job</a> a month later, and never had a job again.
</p><p>
When I finished telling my friend this story, he asked for more.
I said no, that was it.
He said, “No, what about when you sold your company?”
</p><p>
I said no, that didn’t make a big difference in my life.
That was just more money in the bank.
The difference happened when I was 22.
</p><p>
It’s not how much you have.
<strong>
It’s the difference between what you have and what you spend.
</strong>
If you have more than you spend, you’re rich.
If you spend more than you have, you’re not.
If you live cheaply, it’s easy to be free.
</p><p>
Magicians wave one hand around to get your attention, while the other hand does the trick.
To be smart, watch the other hand.

<p>This post was prompted by a tweet by Frank Harrell yesterday asking:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In this post I'll say a little bit about trying to answer Frank's question, and then a little bit about an alternative question which I posed in response, namely, how does the interpretation change if the interval is a Bayesian credible interval, rather than a frequentist confidence interval.</p>



<h2>Frequentist confidence intervals</h2>



<p>A frequentist 95% confidence interval is constructed such that if the model assumptions are correct, if you were to (hypothetically) repeat the experiment or sampling many many times, 95% of the intervals constructed would contain the true value of the parameter. I made a short video last year which performs a simulation in R to demonstrate this definition/idea:</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="1125" height="633" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IGXg6L98lJM?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>



<p>Frank asked how one interprets a particular realised confidence interval (0.72,0.91). The difficulty (as he is well aware!) is that all a frequentist can say is that this particular realised interval either does or does not contain the true parameter value, and they cannot tell you if it does or doesn't. All they can say is that if modelling assumptions are correct, in hypothetical repetitions 95% of the intervals constructed using this procedure contain the true value.</p>



<h2>Bayesian credible intervals</h2>



<p>Let’s now suppose that we’ve done a Bayesian analysis. We’ve specified a prior distribution for the parameter, based on prior evidence, our subjective beliefs about the value of the parameter, or perhaps we used a default ‘non-informative’ prior built into our software package. We use the same model as before, and Bayes theorem gives us the posterior distribution. A Bayesian posterior credible interval is constructed, and suppose it gives us some values. For the sake of simplicity, I’ll assume the interval is again 0.72 to 0.91, but this is not done to suggest a Bayesian analysis credible interval will generally be identical to the frequentist's confidence interval.</p>



<p>How should we interpret this credible interval? A Bayesian would I think say say something like it is an interval for which there is a 95% chance or probability the true parameter lies. At this point we must ask, what do they mean by 95% probability?</p>



<p>We could interpret it as a classical long run frequentist probability, but this means interpreting it like a confidence interval. In fact Bayesian procedures often have good frequentist properties. For example see <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/343/2013/03/large-sample.pdf" target="_blank">Wang and Robins 1998</a> for an analysis of the frequentist properties of multiple imputation for missing data, or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0962280216667764" target="_blank">Bartlett and Keogh 2018</a> for a simulation investigation of the frequentist properties of Bayesian approaches for handling covariate measurement error. In fact, under certain conditions, Bayesian procedures achieve the same frequentist properties of maximum likelihood methods when the sample size gets large - see Chapter 4 of Gelman <em>et al</em>'s excellent<a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Bayesian Data Analysis book</a>.</p>



<p>But conceptually we do not choose to do a Bayesian analysis simply as a means to performing frequentist inference. We choose it because it (hopefully) answers more directly what we are interested in (see Frank Harrell's '<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fharrell.com/post/journey/" target="_blank">My Journey From Frequentist to Bayesian Statistics</a>' post). Namely, it enables us to make probability statements about the unknown parameter given our model, the prior, and the data we have observed. So what is the interpretation of the 95% chance or probability for a credible interval? </p>



<p>I don't know the no doubt large literature on this topic well at all, but the Bayesian's interpretation or definition of probability isn't that clear to me. The Wikipedia entry on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability" target="_blank">Bayesian probability</a> says:</p>



<blockquote><p>Broadly speaking, there are two interpretations of Bayesian probability. For objectivists, who interpret probability as an extension of logic, probability quantifies the reasonable expectation that everyone (even a "robot") who shares the same knowledge should share in accordance with the rules of Bayesian statistics, which can be justified by Cox's theorem.[2][8] For subjectivists, probability corresponds to a personal belief.[3] Rationality and coherence allow for substantial variation within the constraints they pose; the constraints are justified by the Dutch book argument or by decision theory and de Finetti's theorem.[3] The objective and subjective variants of Bayesian probability differ mainly in their interpretation and construction of the prior probability.</p><cite>Wikipedia entry on Bayesian probability</cite></blockquote>



<p>Section 1.5 'Probability as a measure of uncertainty' of <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bayesian Data Analysis</a> talks about the way Bayesian analysis uses probability as a measure of uncertainty, but to my mind it doesn't really define the concept. This is not a criticism. As Gelman et al say earlier in their book:</p>



<blockquote><p>Rather than argue the foundations of statistics—see the bibliographic note at the end of this chapter for references to foundational debates—we prefer to concentrate on the pragmatic advantages of the Bayesian framework, whose flexibility and generality allow it to cope with complex problems.</p></blockquote>



<p>If part of the appeal of Bayesian inference is that it answers the question we really want (i.e. conditional on what we've seen, what do we know / believe about the parameter(s)), it seems to me that the interpretation or definition of prior/posterior probabilities should be relatively straightforward and clear to us. But for me at least, it isn't. I am quite confident (whatever I mean by that!) that this reflects my ignorance on the topic. Part of my motivation for writing this post is the hope that people will help me understand better how to unambiguously define what is meant by a Bayesian prior/posterior probability. Please write a comment if you can help in this regard.</p>



<p>The above does not mean I don't like Bayesian methods. Indeed much of the last 10 years I have been working with and using methods like multiple imputation for missing data whose development take place in the Bayesian paradigm. For me this is fine because I know that methods like multiple imputation have good frequentist properties, and while there are definitely interpretational issues with things confidence intervals, I at least think I understand what they claim to do/be.</p>



<h2>22nd November 2022 postscript</h2>



<p>This evening there was further discussion of this topic on Twitter. As part of this Frank Harrell offered an interpretation for the Bayesian credible interval as follows:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Under data model F and prior P, [0.72, 0.91] is the shortest interval such that the probability the unknown OR generating our data is in that interval is 0.95 (highest posterior density interval).</p>— Frank Harrell (@f2harrell) <a href="https://twitter.com/f2harrell/status/1330633833713111040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 22, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>I followed up with him as to the nature of the probability being referred to here, since it is clear that the probability notion being invoked is broader or distinct than the relative frequency notion of probability. Frank helpfully pointed me in the direction of the entry for 'probability' in his course glossary of terms, which can be <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hbiostat.org/doc/glossary.pdf" target="_blank">accessed here</a>. Part of this entry says:</p>



<blockquote><p>The&nbsp;meaning&nbsp;attached to the metric known as a probability is up to the user; it can represent long-run relative frequency of repeatable observations, a degree of belief, or a measure of veracity or plausibility.</p><cite>https://hbiostat.org/doc/glossary.pdf</cite></blockquote>



<p>and</p>



<blockquote><p>There are other schools of probability that do not require the notion of replication at all. For example, the school of&nbsp;subjective&nbsp;probability (associated with the&nbsp;Bayesian&nbsp;school) “considers probability as a measure of the degree of belief of a given subject in the occurrence of an event or, more generally, in the veracity of a given assertion” (see P. 55 of5). de Finetti defined subjective probability in terms of wagers and odds in betting. A risk-neutral individual would be willing to wager $P&nbsp;that an event will occur when the payoff is $1 and her subjective probability is&nbsp;P&nbsp;for the event.</p><cite>https://hbiostat.org/doc/glossary.pdf</cite></blockquote>



<p>As I wrote in the original post, I do not know the extensive literature on this topic well at all. But what Frank has summarised here is really useful in aiding my understanding of what the interpretation should be of the 95% probability statement attached to a 95% credible interval. It seems to me the notion of probability being invoked when interpreting a 95% credible interval has to be the subjective probability / degree of belief one described in the previous quote. Whether this definition/interpretation meets the criterion of being 'exact', as required by Frank in his tweet at the top of this post when asking for the exact interpretation of a particular realised frequentist confidence interval, I leave readers to decide.</p>

  <h2 id="intro">
  Intro
  <a href="#intro">#</a>
</h2>
<p>TorchScript is one of the most important parts of the Pytorch ecosystem, allowing portable, efficient and nearly seamless deployment. With just a few lines of <code>torch.jit</code> code and some simple model changes you can export an asset that runs anywhere <code>libtorch</code> does. It’s an important toolset to master if you want to run your models outside the lab at high efficiency.</p>
<p>Good <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/Intro_to_TorchScript_tutorial.html">introductory material</a> is already available for starting to work with <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html">TorchScript</a> including <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_export.html">execution in the C++ <code>libtorch</code> runtime</a>, and <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit_language_reference.html">reference material</a> is also provided. This article is a collection of topics going beyond the basics of your first export.</p>
<h2 id="tracing-vs-scripting">
  Tracing vs Scripting
  <a href="#tracing-vs-scripting">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Pytorch provides two methods for generating TorchScript from your model code — tracing and scripting — but which should you use? Let’s recap how they work:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.jit.trace.html"><strong>Tracing.</strong></a> When using <code>torch.jit.trace</code> you’ll provide your model and sample input as arguments. The input will be fed through the model as in regular inference and the executed operations will be traced and recorded into TorchScript. Logical structure will be frozen into the path taken during this sample execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.jit.script.html"><strong>Scripting.</strong></a> When using <code>torch.jit.script</code> you’ll simply provide your model as an argument. TorchScript will be generated from the static inspection of the <code>nn.Module</code> contents (recursively).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not obvious from the tutorial documentation, but choosing which method to use is a fairly simple and fluid choice:</p>
<h3 id="use-scripting-by-default">
  Use Scripting by Default
  <a href="#use-scripting-by-default">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Because <code>torch.jit.script</code> captures both the operations and full conditional logic of your model, it’s a great place to start. If your model doesn’t need any <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit_unsupported.html">unsupported Pytorch functionality</a> and has logic restricted to the <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit_builtin_functions.html#python-built-in-functions">supported subset of Python functions</a> and <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit_python_reference.html">syntax</a>, then <code>torch.jit.script</code> should be all you need.</p>
<p>One major advantage of scripting over tracing is that an export is likely to either fail for a well-defined reason — implying a clear code modification — or succeed without warnings.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Unlike Python, TorchScript is Statically Typed</strong></p>
<p>You will need to be consistent about container element datatypes, and be wary of implicit function signatures. A useful practice is to use type hints in method signatures.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Despite TorchScript’s ability to capture conditional logic it does not allow you to run arbitrary Python within <code>libtorch</code> — a popular misconception.</p>
<h3 id="use-tracing-if-you-must">
  Use Tracing if You Must
  <a href="#use-tracing-if-you-must">#</a>
</h3>
<p>There are a few special cases in which <code>torch.jit.trace</code> may be useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are unable to modify the model code — because you do not have access or ownership — you may find scripting the model simply will not work because it uses unsupported Pytorch/Python functionality.</li>
<li>In pursuit of performance or to bake in architectural decisions the logic freezing behavior of tracing might be preferable — similar to inlining C/C++ code.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Pay Close Attention to Tracer Warnings</strong></p>
<p>Due to how tracing can simplify model behavior, each warning should be fully understood and only then ignored (or fixed). Also, be sure to trace in eval mode if you are exporting a model for production inference!</p>

</blockquote>

<h3 id="use-both-together">
  Use Both Together
  <a href="#use-both-together">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Scripted and traced code can be freely mixed, and this is often a great choice. See the existing <a href="https://pytorch.org/">pytorch.org</a> documentation for <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html#mixing-tracing-and-scripting">details</a> and <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/Intro_to_TorchScript_tutorial.html#mixing-scripting-and-tracing">examples</a>.</p>
<h2 id="device-pinning">
  Device Pinning
  <a href="#device-pinning">#</a>
</h2>
<p>If you find yourself using <code>torch.jit.trace</code> on some code, you’ll have to actively deal with some of the gotchas or face performance and portability consequences. Besides addressing any warnings Pytorch emits, you’ll also need to keep an eye out for device pinning. Just like <code>torch.jit.trace</code> records and freezes conditional logic, it will also trace and make constant the values resulting from this logic — this can include device constants.</p>
<p>Using this sample code:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>arange</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>.</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If we trace while executing on CPU or GPU we get this TorchScript (scroll to the right on mobile):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>:</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>:</span>
  <span>_0</span> <span>=</span> <span>ops</span><span>.</span><span>prim</span><span>.</span><span>NumToTensor</span><span>(</span><span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>))</span>
  <span>_1</span> <span>=</span> <span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>arange</span><span>(</span><span>annotate</span><span>(</span><span>number</span><span>,</span> <span>_0</span><span>),</span> <span>dtype</span><span>=</span><span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>layout</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>device</span><span>=</span><span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>device</span><span>(</span><span>"cpu"</span><span>),</span> <span>pin_memory</span><span>=</span><span>False</span><span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>_1</span></code></pre></div>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You can see that <code>torch.device("cpu")</code> has been inserted as a constant into the generated TorchScript. If we try to get clever with this code:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>arange</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>.</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>),</span> <span>device</span><span>=</span><span>X</span><span>.</span><span>device</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Tracing will now result in TorchScript that is pinned to the tracing device. When traced on GPU, we see this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span>
    <span>X</span><span>:</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>:</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>_1</span></code></pre></div>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tensors Created During Tracing Will Have Their Device Pinned</strong></p>
<p>This can be a significant performance and portability problem.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3 id="performance-and-portability">
  Performance and Portability
  <a href="#performance-and-portability">#</a>
</h3>
<p>If we later deserialize and run this TorchScript in <code>libtorch</code> the <code>arange</code> tensor will always be created on the device that is pinned — <code>torch.device("cpu")</code> or <code>torch.device("cuda:0")</code> in the examples above. If the rest of the model is running on a different device this can result in costly memory transfers and synchronization.</p>
<p>This device pinning issue extends to multi-GPU scenarios as well. If you have traced and exported a model on <code>cuda:0</code> and then run it on <code>cuda:1</code> you’ll see transfers and synchronization between the devices. Not good. Perhaps even worse, if such a model is run in an environment without any CUDA-capable device it will fail since <code>cuda:0</code> doesn’t exist.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Replace Tensors Created During Execution With Parameters</strong></p>
<p>Tensors created in the execution path while tracing will have their device pinned. Depending on model logic, these can often be turned into Parameters created during construction.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>An example of the problem looks like this in Nsight Systems:</p>

<h2 id="direct-graph-modification">
  Direct Graph Modification
  <a href="#direct-graph-modification">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Once we’ve used <code>torch.jit.script</code> or <code>torch.jit.trace</code> to generate a ScriptModule or ScriptFunction we can use <code>.graph</code>, <code>.inlined_graph</code> or <code>.code</code> to understand exactly what TorchScript has been generated. Though it has an entirely undocumented interface it is possible (and fun) to access and modify the generated TorchScript AST directly via the <code>.graph</code> method.</p>
<p>The most useful parts of the API are defined in <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/torch/csrc/jit/python/python_ir.cpp">torch/csrc/jit/python/python_ir.cpp</a>. As you can see, all the basic functionality is present for finding and changing the graph nodes you want. If you change nodes or arguments and then persist the module your subsequent TorchScript load and inference will reflect your changes, though modules cannot be changed recursively in this way (<code>torch.jit.freeze</code> can be useful here).</p>
<p>An example of the kind of graph modification that is possible:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>undevice</span><span>(</span><span>tsc</span><span>):</span>
    <span># use ::to variant which does not hardcode device</span>

        <span>to_node</span><span>.</span><span>removeAllInputs</span><span>()</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>a</span> <span>in</span> <span>[</span><span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>dtype</span><span>,</span> <span>non_blocking</span><span>,</span> <span>copy</span><span>,</span> <span>mem_format</span><span>]:</span>
            <span>to_node</span><span>.</span><span>addInput</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span>

        <span>if</span> <span>not</span> <span>constant</span><span>.</span><span>hasUses</span><span>():</span>
            <span>constant</span><span>.</span><span>destroy</span><span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The above code will modify a traced graph, changing <code>aten::to</code> to use an overload which doesn’t change memory location.</p>
<p>But what is this really useful for? As an undocumented API you’d be unwise to use this capability in a production pipeline unless you like maintenance coding. I would only recommend it for research, as in the above example which I used to understand and profile the transfer/synchronization behavior of tensor subscripting.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Don’t Bother With Direct Graph Modification</strong></p>
<p>For legitimate production use-cases you can almost always find a way to modify your model code to generate the TorchScript you want.</p>

<p>You can get some <a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-deepstream-pipeline/#stage-3-hacked-deepstream-mdash-80-tensorrt-20-torchscript">awesome results with TensorRT</a> but exporting a model from Pytorch to TensorRT is far from a sure thing. The export path to ONNX and then to TensorRT can fail due to missing or incompatible operations at either step and this can be frustrating.</p>

<p>The Last Super is<strong> brand new Super Nintendo (SNES) game</strong> created to celebrate the 30th birthday of the console!</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzQ1NzUyMDUuZ2lm/original/sd47O2.gif"><br></p>
<p>As the last SNES cartridge on Earth, you'll have to move and jump around in each of the 20 levels of the game so every SNES can play you! But don't let a SNES without cartridge for too long...</p>
<h2>SNES ROM or cartridge?</h2>
<p>The Last Super is an actual game for the Super Nintendo / SNES / Super Famicom console. If you want to play it on a real console, you can <a href="https://catskullelectronics.com/collections/games/products/the-last-super" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">buy a beautiful game cartridge</a> from Catskull Games. As an extra bonus, this cartridge also contains my previous SNES game <a href="https://drludos.itch.io/keeping-snes-alive" target="_blank">Keeping SNES Alive!</a><br></p>

<p>The cartridge is made from newly built elements<em> (PCB, shells, etc)</em> all designed and hand assembled in the US by Catskull himself. The cartridge is region-free. It has been tested and working on NTSC SNES, PAL SNES, JP SFC, and Analogue Super Nt.</p>
<p>If your prefer to play it on emulator, you can <a href="https://drludos.itch.io/the-last-super/purchase" target="_blank">download a ROM version of the game here</a>, and use it with any SNES emulator you like. Here are a few examples: </p>

<h2>Looking for challenge?</h2>
<p>My <strong>current record in survival mode is 35</strong>. Here's the proof:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzQ1ODEyMzIuanBn/original/sTHVSK.jpg"><br></p>
<h2>Behind the scenes</h2>
<p>The game was <strong>programmed in C</strong> using the wonderful <a href="https://github.com/alekmaul/pvsneslib" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">PVSNESlib</a> by Alekmaul.</p>
<p>The <strong>music was composed by </strong><a href="https://soundcloud.com/xracecar" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>XRACECAR</strong></a>. The two tracks are:</p>
<ul><li><em>"ayyy you know the man"</em> (under a Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-SA license)<br><a href="http://battleofthebits.org/arena/Entry/ayyy+you+know+the+man.xm/23747/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://battleofthebits.org/arena/Entry/ayyy+you+know+the+man.xm/23747/</a> <em><a href="http://battleofthebits.org/arena/Entry/7049+Bytes+of+Memories/25393/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><br></a></em></li><li><em><a href="http://battleofthebits.org/arena/Entry/7049+Bytes+of+Memories/25393/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"></a>"7049 Bytes of Memories"</em> (under a Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-SA license)<br><a href="http://battleofthebits.org/arena/Entry/7049+Bytes+of+Memories/25393/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://battleofthebits.org/arena/Entry/7049+Bytes+of+Memories/25393/</a></li></ul>
<p><strong>A fun fact about the audio</strong>: the <em>"shlack</em>" sound that you hear when the cartridge enters a console is an<strong> actual recording of the noise made by my SNES power button</strong> <em>(recorded directly from my childhood console, still alive and kicking after 30 years!)</em></p>
<p>Last but not the least, <a href="https://drludos.itch.io/the-last-super/purchase" target="_blank">the full source code is included</a>.<strong> I spent a lot of time cleaning up and commenting the code as thoroughly as I could</strong>, hoping it'll help and motivate you to start making new SNES games too!<br></p></div></div>]]>

Such as their name, email, phone, company name, website, or department. During the same flow, we also ask them to create a password or link their social accounts via OAuth2.</p><p>So why was qrmenucreator so refreshing? You don't even need to sign up!

Very clever and doesn't feel like an information grab.</p><h2>How can I use this?</h2><p>For a SaaS product that doesn't use public URLs (i.e: handles sensitive data):</p><ol><li>Ask for only the email on the marketing page.</li><li>Save the email to your database and generate a unique UUID for that account.</li><li>Create a session associated with the UUID and redirect the user to the app.</li><li>To log back into the app they can either use a magic link via email or create a password.</li></ol><p>For a SaaS product that can use public URLs:</p><ol><li>Generate a unique UUID for the "thing" your user creates.</li><li>Give your user a unique URL to use to edit/delete their "thing".</li><li>Prompt for sending the unique URL to their email to stop them from losing access to their "thing".</li><li>You now have a user you can email for upsells.</li></ol><h2>Questions</h2><h3>What about personalisation?</h3><p>Make providing extra information part of "completing their profile" (i.e: gamify giving away data).

Hot tip you should make the "verify" button open up mail.google.com or outlook.com based on the email domain.</p><h3>I already have good conversion</h3><p>Imagine what your conversion rate would look like if you removed all but one of your sign up fields?</p><h3>My sales team needs X/Y info</h3><p>If the customer wants to be contacted then you can email them 🤷.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><h3 id="openmp-vs-posix-threads">OpenMP vs POSIX threads</h3>
<p>Both are APIs for shared-memory programming. In C, OpenMP is a relatively high-level extension, providing compiler directives for parallelizing many programs with ease while some low-level thread interactions may be difficult to program. Pthreads provide some low-level coordination constructs that are unavailable in OpenMP, making other programs easier to parallelize while requiring explicit specification of the behavior of each thread, which may virtually be any that is conceivable.</p>
<p>Pthreads programs can be used with <em>any</em> C compiler, provided the system has a Pthreads library. OpenMP requires compiler support for some operations, which <em>many</em> compilers provide.</p>
<h3 id="area-under-the-curve">Area Under the Curve</h3>
<p>The program we are about to develop is oftentimes called the 'Hello world!' of parallel programming. We will be using the following formula for <cite>arctan(1)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></cite> in approximating the value for π.</p>
<p><span><span><img src="https://hasithsen.github.io/tech/posts/parallelizing-pi-approx-openmp/Leibniz-formula-for-pi.png" alt="Leibniz-formula-for-pi.png"></span><span><span>Just as we learned a long time ago in Kindergarten, the value of the integral here is the area between the graph and the x-axis while x goes from 0 to 1.</span></span></span></p>
<p>Going through the serial version of the program in C, the value for above is calculated for each integer within range <strong>[1, N)</strong> and summed up within a loop. The resulting <strong>sum</strong> is them divided by <strong>N</strong> for getting an estimate of <strong>π / 4</strong>, before printing out the calculated <em>approximate</em> for π.</p>

<p>Before changing anything, it pays to understand whatever we want changed in the first-place. So, let us go through the above code. The function <code>omp_get_wtime()</code>, defined in <code>omp.h</code>, returns the amount of seconds since a previous <em>fixed</em> point in time (included for execution timing purposes). Setting the number of threads to spawn when running parallel code (code inside parallel scope, that is) done by <code>omp_set_num_threds</code>. Changing the <code>set</code> to <code>get</code> and calling from <em>within</em> a parallel section returns the number of threads in execution (<code>get</code> counterpart is available for most functions with <code>set</code>). However, due to resource constraints on the system, it is possible we ending up with a lower number of threads.</p>
<p>The directive <code>#pragma omp parallel</code> is for parallelizing the code–it is safe to assume if this is not present somewhere, the program will not be parallelized by OpenMP. The scope of code that needs to be executed in parallel may be defined the same way we do scoping in C, with <code>{}</code>, or without–whereas only immediately following code line will be considered in-scope. This is where new threads will be spawned and start running alongside the master thread, branching the execution.</p>
<p>Any variables created within the parallel scope are private for each thread (i.e. <code>sum_thread</code>), and will not contribute to race conditions. Therefore, the <code>for</code> loop incrementing <code>sum_thread</code> is divided among threads spawned. Please note the way threads divide the iterations among themselves can be handled up to some extent with specific directives, the default behavior is expected here by omitting them.</p>
<p>Critical sections may be scoped within <code>#pragma omp atomic</code> or <code>#pragma omp critical</code>. The former enables low level atomicity of execution (with higher performance) if available, and only accepts a single assignment statement (of an allowed form) within scope, while the latter can handle multiple statements. Both effectively serializes execution. If we end up with most of the code within the scope of either, our code is probably too poor for parallelization with OpenMP.</p>
<p>Outside the <code>#pragma omp parallel</code> scope, previously spawned threads will join the master thread, and it will continue executing similar to a serial program. It is worth mentioning that we may have as many parallel/serial sections as we please.</p>
<p>As should be apparent from above, OpenMP is designed to be easy to learn and can be used for parallelizing existing serial code with minimal modifications. What if we could further simplify the above code?</p>
<h3 id="reducing-the-parallel-code">Reducing the Parallel Code</h3>
<p>Modifying the <code>sum</code> variable at the end of the <code>for</code> loop in above code could be simplified with a reduction operation provided by OpenMP. That is, we can instruct OpenMP to synchronously add the <em>local sum</em> calculated by each thread (within loop) to the shared variable <code>sum</code> as shown in the parallel version below.</p>

<p>Here, we have a single statement <code>#pragma omp parallel for</code> that tells we want the immediately-following <code>for</code> loop parallelized, which is identical to having <code>#pragma omp for</code> immediately before a <code>for</code> loop <em>within</em> the scope of <code>#pragma omp parallel</code>. The <code>reduction(+:sum)</code> tells that we want the <code>sum</code> variable to contain the <em>sum</em> of each local sum calculated in each iteration only available locally to the thread that runs it. OpenMP does this by creating a private <em>sum</em> variable for each thread and initializing it to <strong>unit</strong> according to the operation (ex. <strong>0</strong> for <code>+</code>, <strong>1</strong> for <code>*</code>), this is how we use the <strong>reduction operator</strong> in OpenMP. The <code>shared(N)</code> tells that the <code>N</code> variable should be shared with all threads, this is fine since threads are only reading it–therefore no potential data races. Finally, the approximated values along with the time taken for calculations are printed.</p>
<p>Now that we went through the code, note that the  <code>omp_set_num_threads</code> is not mandatory when using OpenMP, the program defaults to spawning the maximum number of threads possible on the system at execution time.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>The most exciting moment of the web application development is a deployment. Your app is going live! It can also be nerve-wracking moment. Unfortunately. There are many options, many variables and configurations. It is easy to miss something … In this article, I will show you how to pack Django and React application into containers and deploy them with <code>docker-compose</code>. The presented approach can be reused on any Cloud Provider (AWS, DigitalOcean, Linode, GCP, Heroku) - you just need a Virtual Private Server (VPS).</p>

<p>In this article:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We will create two <code>docker-compose</code> configuration files. One for development (easier version) and one for production (with SSL certificate from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a>).</li>
  <li>The React static files will be served by <code>nginx</code>.</li>
  <li>The Django static files (from admin and DRF browsable API) will be served by <code>nginx</code>.</li>
  <li>The <code>nginx</code> will be reverse-proxy to the Django server (<code>gunicorn</code>).</li>
  <li>In the production, we will add <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/"><code>certbot</code></a> to renew the certificate. To issue a certificate we will use a bash script. You need to have a domain to issue the certificate .</li>
</ul>

<p>We will be using code from the previous article: <a href="https://saasitive.com/tutorial/crud-django-rest-framework-react/">CRUD in Django Rest Framework and React</a> (code with <a href="https://github.com/saasitive/django-react-boilerplate/tree/v6">tag v6</a>).</p>

<h2 id="create-dockerfile-for-django-and-nginx">Create Dockerfile for Django and Nginx</h2>

<p>Let’s start by adding a new directory <code>docker</code> in the main directory of the project. Your project structure should look like below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>.</span>
├── backend
├── docker
├── frontend
├── LICENSE
└── README.md
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the <code>docker</code> directory please add <code>backend</code> directory with two files:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>docker/backend/Dockerfile</code> - it will define how to build Django container,</li>
  <li><code>docker/backend/wsgi-entrypoint.sh</code> - it will be entrypoint for Django container. It will apply migrations, collect static files and run WSGI server with <a href="https://gunicorn.org/"><code>gunicorn</code></a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="django-dockerfile">Django Dockerfile</h3>

<p>The <code>Dockerfile</code> to build Django container:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># docker/backend/Dockerfile</span>

<span>FROM</span><span> python:3.8.3-alpine</span>

<span>WORKDIR</span><span> /app</span>
<span>ADD</span><span> ./backend/requirements.txt /app/backend/</span>


<span>RUN </span>pip <span>install</span> <span>--upgrade</span> pip
<span>RUN </span>pip <span>install </span>gunicorn
<span>RUN </span>pip <span>install</span> <span>-r</span> backend/requirements.txt

<span>ADD</span><span> ./docker /app/docker</span>
<span>ADD</span><span> ./backend /app/backend</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this <code>Dockerfile</code> the <code>python:3.8.3-alpine</code> is used as base image. Let’s decode this image name and tag. It contains python in version <code>3.8.3</code>, running in the Linux distribution <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/"><code>Alpine</code></a> which is lightweight. The purpose of using lightweight Linux is to have small image which will result in faster builds. You can of course use different base image. For purpose of this tutorial the <code>python:3.8.3-alpine</code> is sufficient.</p>

<p>We create <code>/app</code> directory in the container and copy <code>/backend/requirements.txt</code>. Then, <code>gunicorn</code> and all needed packages are installed. The backend source code is copied at the end of the container build. It is on purpose. It makes building faster. When you change something in the code (without changing the <code>requirements.txt</code> file), only the last line of the <code>Dockerfile</code> will be executed and the rest will be read from cache (of course if available).</p>

<p>The <code>Dockerfile</code> is not executing any command, we will use <code>wsgi-entrypoint.sh</code> script for this purpose.</p>

<h3 id="docker-entrypoint">Docker entrypoint</h3>

<p>Please add a new file <code>docker/backend/wsgi-entrypoint.sh</code> and add execute rights to the file (it is a bash script):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># add execute rights</span>
<span>chmod</span> +x docker/backend/wsgi-entrypoint.sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>docker/backend/wsgi-entrypoint.sh</code> file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/sh</span>

<span>until </span><span>cd</span> /app/backend/server
<span>do
    </span><span>echo</span> <span>"Waiting for server volume..."</span>
<span>done

until</span> ./manage.py migrate
<span>do
    </span><span>echo</span> <span>"Waiting for db to be ready..."</span>
    <span>sleep </span>2
<span>done</span>

./manage.py collectstatic <span>--noinput</span>

gunicorn server.wsgi <span>--bind</span> 0.0.0.0:8000 <span>--workers</span> 4 <span>--threads</span> 4

<span>#####################################################################################</span>
<span># Options to DEBUG Django server</span>
<span># Optional commands to replace abouve gunicorn command</span>

<span># Option 1:</span>
<span># run gunicorn with debug log level</span>
<span># gunicorn server.wsgi --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 --workers 1 --threads 1 --log-level debug</span>

<span># Option 2:</span>
<span># run development server</span>
<span># DEBUG=True ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above script is waiting till serever volume and database is ready. It runs migration on database and collect static files. It runs <code>gunicorn</code> server with IP address <code>0.0.0.0</code> and (docker default IP) and port <code>8000</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>gunicorn</code> is running <code>4</code> workers with <code>4</code> threads each. You can set different numbers here. It depends on your machine. There are some heuristic rules that set number of workers as <code>4 * CPU cores</code> (see the <a href="https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/settings.html#workers">gunicorn docs</a>). If you are deploying application to machine with 1 CPU core, then you can use <code>4</code> workers. (Remember, it is just heuristic not an exact rule). Then you can specify how many threads will be running in each worker. In our case, there are <code>4</code> threads (<a href="https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/settings.html#threads">gunicorn docs</a>). This means that we can process <code>4 * 4 = 16</code> concurrent requests.</p>

<p><strong>1st Note:</strong> We are using <a href="https://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> for our development - it doesn’t support concurrency. We will need to replace SQLite with advanced database engine like <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>. I will replace database at the end of this tutorial to make final deployment. I think it is good to deploy application. We will practice deployment and code updates in the production. That’s why we are here.</p>

<p><strong>2nd Note:</strong> One more thing, I added other options to run Django server in <code>wsgi-entrypoint.sh</code> which are commmented. Why? You might need them for debugging. The first option add logging to the console with debug level and run <code>gunicorn</code> with one worker and single thread. The second option runs Django development server with <code>DEBUG=True</code>. It needs setting environment variable and load it in <code>settings.py</code> with <a href="https://github.com/henriquebastos/python-decouple"><code>python-decouple</code></a> (for example), I will write about this in the future post.</p>

<h4 id="django-static-files">Django static files</h4>

<p>Before going further, let’s update <code>STATIC_URL</code> variable in the <code>backend/server/server/settings.py</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># backend/server/server/settings.py
</span>
<span>MEDIA_URL</span> <span>=</span> <span>'/media/'</span>
<span>STATIC_URL</span> <span>=</span> <span>'/django_static/'</span> 
<span>STATIC_ROOT</span> <span>=</span> <span>BASE_DIR</span> <span>/</span> <span>'django_static'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We overwrite <code>STATIC_URL</code> with a new value. All static files will be served with <code>/django_static/</code> in the URL. We add two new variables:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>MEDIA_URL</code> - it is URL for serving files uploaded to Django application, we will use it in future posts.</li>
  <li><code>STATIC_ROOT</code> - it is a directory where static files from Django application will be stored after running <code>collectstatic</code> command. The <code>nginx</code> will point to this path.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="nginx-dockerfile-and-configuration">Nginx Dockerfile and Configuration</h3>

<p>Please add <code>nginx</code> directory in the <code>docker</code> directory. There will be added three files:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>docker/nginx/Dockerfile</code> - the instructions how to build <code>nginx</code> container image,</li>
  <li><code>docker/nginx/development/default.conf</code> - the configuration file for <code>nginx</code> server used in the development,</li>
  <li><code>docker/nginx/production/default.conf</code> - the configuration file for the production.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>Dockerfile</code> for <code>nginx</code> container will use two stage build.</p>

<ul>
  <li>At first stage, we build the React static files.</li>
  <li>At second stage, the static files are copied and <code>nginx</code> server starts. We copy React static files into <code>/usr/share/nginx/html</code> directory.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>docker/nginx/Dockerfile</code> file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># The first stage</span>
<span># Build React static files</span>
<span>FROM</span><span> node:13.12.0-alpine as build</span>

<span>WORKDIR</span><span> /app/frontend</span>
<span>COPY</span><span> ./frontend/package.json ./</span>
<span>COPY</span><span> ./frontend/package-lock.json ./</span>
<span>RUN </span>npm ci <span>--silent</span>
<span>COPY</span><span> ./frontend/ ./</span>
<span>RUN </span>npm run build

<span># The second stage</span>
<span># Copy React static files and start nginx</span>
<span>FROM</span><span> nginx:stable-alpine</span>
<span>COPY</span><span> --from=build /app/frontend/build /usr/share/nginx/html</span>
<span>CMD</span><span> ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At the second stage, we copy only the final product of the first stage: static files. The <code>node_modules</code> (they can take a lot of space) with dependency files are not in the final image. Such two stage-build makes the size of the final image smaller.</p>

<p>Let’s add <code>nginx</code> configuration for development version of <code>docker-compose</code> (without SSL certificate):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>server</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>listen</span> <span>80</span><span>;</span>
    <span>server_name</span> <span>_</span><span>;</span>

        <span>alias</span> <span>/app/backend/server/django_static/</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>What do you feel when you see <code>nginx</code> configuration file?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No troubles! The <code>nginx</code> is here to help us. It will do what we will ask in the configuration.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>server</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>listen</span> <span>80</span><span>;</span>
    <span>server_name</span> <span>_</span><span>;</span>
    <span>server_tokens</span> <span>off</span><span>;</span>
    <span>client_max_body_size</span> <span>20M</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At the begining of the configuration we define a server (<code>server</code> keyword). It will listen on port <code>80</code> (it is a default <code>HTTP</code> port). There is no name assigned to the server (<code>server_name _;</code>). We switch off option to show server version on error pages (<code>server_token off;</code> <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#server_tokens">see docs</a>). The last setting is to set maximum request size (<a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_max_body_size">see docs</a>) (<code>client_max_body_size 20M</code>). It means that requests larger than 20MB will result in error with HTTP 413 (Request Entity Too Large).</p>

<p>We have five <code>location</code> blocks (<a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#location">location docs</a>) in the config which specify configuration for each URL (routing for requests).</p>

<p>The first <code>location /</code> defines what to do if the request comes from <code>/</code> (main domain or IP). The <code>index.html</code> file from <code>/usr/share/nginx/html</code> will be served as a response. It is our React static <code>index.html</code> file.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>location</span> <span>/</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>root</span>   <span>/usr/share/nginx/html</span><span>;</span>
        <span>index</span>  <span>index.html</span> <span>index.htm</span><span>;</span>
        <span>try_files</span> <span>$uri</span> <span>$uri</span><span>/</span> <span>/index.html</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The second and third locations <code>location /api</code> and <code>location /admin</code> redirect requests to <code>location @proxy_api</code>. It is a reverse-proxy:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>location</span> <span>/api</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>try_files</span> <span>$uri</span> <span>@proxy_api</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>location</span> <span>/admin</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>try_files</span> <span>$uri</span> <span>@proxy_api</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What we have in fourth <code>location @proxy_api</code>? It is our Django application served with <code>gunicorn</code>. The <code>nginx</code> forwards all requests with <code>/api</code> and <code>/a…</code></p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>Regular 1-on-1 (often also written as 1:1) meetings are an important satisfaction factor for remote teams. For managers and companies, it's amazing to stay in the loop and resolve friction quickly. For employees, it's a rare chance to voice opinions and difficulties.</p>
<p>Especially in async environments and other remote teams where face-to-face time is sparse, this regularly scheduled personal time can be a&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's why 1-on-1s are extra important for remote teams, how they work best and why the greatest remote teams are so religious about them.</p>

<h2>What is a 1-on-1 meeting?</h2>
<p>As the name suggests, a 1-on-1 meeting is a discussion between two parties. 1-on-1s are traditionally conducted for things like <strong>performance reviews</strong> or <strong>confidential discussions</strong> between a manager and their direct report.</p>
<p>In remote teams, face-to-face time can be sparse. It's more difficult to catch someone during their coffee break and talk things out. More formally scheduled 1-on-1s can be the solution for that.</p>
<p>Other than what's traditional, it's not uncommon to have 1-on-1s <strong>outside the manager-report relationship</strong>, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>satisfaction survey between employee and HR</li>
<li>knowledge exchange between team leaders</li>
<li>pair review between peers, co-working</li>
</ul>
<p>But even the more traditional manger-report 1-on-1 meetings <strong>holds more weight</strong> in remote work: It's the one place where employees can voice concerns, talk about their growth, their goals or any friction that has come up.</p>

<h2>The benefits of 1-on-1s for remote employees and managers</h2>
<p>When it comes to remote employees, regularly scheduled 1-on-1 meetings are a miracle tool when it comes to retention and employee satisfaction. As mentioned, they are a welcome place to voice concerns early or talk about growth.</p>
<p>For ambitious employees that creates an atmosphere where friction can get moved out of the way quickly, where ears are always open for concerns and growth desires can be made explicit.</p>

<p><img src="https://nohq.co/media/undraw_Meeting_re_i53h.png" alt="" width="600" height="358"></p>

<p>That sounds like an amazing deal for any employee, but obviously, it also comes at a high cost for managers.</p>
<p>For a team with 8 direct reports, bi-weekly 1-on-1s at a duration of 30 minutes per meeting, that's a full workday of added meeting time every single month! What's in it for the managers?</p>
<p>The benefits for employees can be reversed and are just as important for them:</p>
<ul>
<li>get rid of friction early</li>
<li>know where reports want to be in their careers</li>
<li>stay in the loop about newest developments</li>
<li>better picture of morale and difficulties</li>
</ul>
<p>Given any actionable manager, this is definitely worth its time as actions can be taken that improve satisfaction and retention.</p>
<p>And indeed, <a href="https://www.leapsome.com/blog/meeting-with-purpose-the-unique-benefits-of-1-on-1-meetings">research shows</a> that while group meetings tend to lower employee satisfaction rates, 1-on-1 meetings actively improve that same metric!</p>

<h2>Productive 1-on-1 meetings methods</h2>
<p>1-on-1 meetings aren't hard to do right. As long as they are scheduled consistently and follows a common path – besides having a culture that allows for honest feedback – there's definitely a benefit to doing them.</p>
<p>As with so many things, some people have taken it a step further and created detailed methods and best practises to running 1-on-1 meetings.</p>

<h3>The traffic light check-in</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.connorswenson.com/blog/red-yellow-green-the-traffic-light-that-can-transform-your-meetings">traffic light check-in</a>, also called "Red Yellow Green" check-in is one of the meeting methods that has brought success to companies like Google, Etsy and many startups. So much, in fact, it's being taught by executive and management coaches around the world.</p>

<p><img src="https://nohq.co/media/eliobed-suarez-PN-YnI5stdQ-unsplash.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></p>

<p>The concept is quite simple: If we take a traffic light as a model, your 1-on-1 partner describes their mood as one of the colors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Green</strong> means everything is OK, nothing that dampens the mood or blocks you from being near your peak. Let's talk.</li>
<li><strong>Yellow</strong> means so-so. Maybe things are stressful or there's an upcoming blocker. Let's discuss.</li>
<li><strong>Red</strong> is bad! The person is overwhelmed, blocked or is feeling terrible. Let's solve this.</li>
</ul>
<p>An alternative form of this is to collect topics and assign them to each of the colors, for example, <strong>green</strong> describes all the things that were great,&nbsp;<strong>yellow</strong> includes discussion topics that could have gone better and&nbsp;<strong>red</strong> are priority discussion points about things that failed.</p>

<h3>Skip-level meetings</h3>
<p>A skip-level meeting "skips" one layer of responsibility and is usually conducted with the person's manager's manager or even a head of department or CEO.</p>
<p>For remote teams, this can be a great irregular thing to schedule. On one side, employees have the possibility to discuss wider changes and bring up interesting ideas, while managers and executives have a more direct line to the culture and issues of their sub-reports.</p>
<p>Skip-level meetings are usually not done more than once per year per 1-on-1 combination, for leaders, however, it can be a good idea to schedule these monthly or even bi-weekly to have a deeper look into different teams.</p>

<h3>Goal and growth conversations</h3>
<p>A growth (or goal) conversation is different from the regular 1-on-1 check-ins as that it's designed to be a more formal evaluation and discussion. Other than the more traditional performance evaluation, it's a discussion around goals, current progress and growth.</p>
<p>As such, it doesn't have much influence on things like salaries or promotions but instead can help to improve employee satisfaction. In fact, <a href="https://www.intechopen.com/books/career-development-and-job-satisfaction/career-development-an-enabler-for-job-satisfaction">research shows</a> that the major reason for employee satisfaction boils down to career development, so it's something that shouldn't be dismissed.</p>
<p>Growth conversations happen more often than traditional evaluations – usually every quarter up to once per month – and help answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is my short-term goal?</li>
<li>Did I reach my goal last time?</li>
<li>What stopped/enabled me to reach my goal?</li>
<li>What is my big goal for the next year?</li>
<li>What is my progress in reaching that?</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the situation, these conversations can be difficult. For ambitious employees, however, they could be the main driver in motivation, engagement, loyalty and retention.</p>

<h2>7 Tips for better 1-on-1 meetings</h2>
<p>When it comes to 1-on-1 meetings, learning by doing is the keyword. Even if you don't have a plan for them, to start today is to begin the investment in retention and loyalty.</p>
<p>Before you go, though, we hope that these practical tips can help you get started with better 1-on-1 meetings.</p>

<h3>1. Start with an agenda</h3>
<p>It's good practice to set up a way for you and your meeting partner to build an <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/remote-meeting-best-practices/">agenda before the call</a>. Some popular methods to do so are Google Docs and <a href="https://nohq.co/tools/todoist/">Todoist</a>, where projects can be shared between two people.</p>
<p>The great part – simple to solve questions can be solved in writing even before the meeting and when it comes to harder discussions, your meeting partner can prepare for those beforehand. It also helps to keep meetings running smoothly and ending on time.</p>

<h3>2. Stick to a type of meeting</h3>
<p>A little earlier in this post, we described a few popular meeting techniques. While you can tweak meetings and even switch them around, it's usually good to stick to a certain interval and meeting form for a while, to make sure it works out.</p>
<p>Sticking to something for a while helps both of you to settle into a certain flow and helps with evaluating how good something works.</p>

<h3>3. Keep async stuff away</h3>
<p>In the first point, we talked about getting simple questions out of the way early through your agenda. Your agenda items should be evaluated whether they <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/making-asynchronous-communication-work/">should have been an email</a> – or a message – instead.</p>
<p>For example, it feels natural to give a status update during these meetings and checking in whether everything is on track. However, it's a better practice to write this down somewhere and have it recorded – so it can be crossed away from the meeting agenda.</p>
<p>Instead, the meeting should include socialization, talking about emotional topics and hashing out difficult discussions.</p>

<h3>4. Stay consistent</h3>
<p>As with anything, consistency is key! As you go into this new form of collaboration, give yourself the challenge to keep up with it for a few months or even a year.</p>
<p>It's important to keep each other accountable, so pick a specific timeslot, reserve a calendar block and don't make these optional. While some of them can be skipped, it shouldn't become the norm.</p>

<h3>5. Take notes</h3>
<p>Taking notes during the discussion can help you recall information, go back to previous meetings and find patterns and also help you to digest the information on the next day.</p>
<p>Hopefully, good notes can help you read between the lines and see recurring themes that are being discussed again and again.</p>

<h3>6. Build action items</h3>
<p>We all love homework, don't we! For 1-on-1 meetings, however, it could be a good idea to set agenda items and to-dos for the next meeting already, so-called action items.</p>
<p>These action items are usually not about the core work, but instead about the topics that were discussed – specific thoughts about growths or an issue that has been cumbersome for a few weeks.</p>

<h3>7. Run regular retrospectives</h3>
<p>1-on-1s are never set in stone! The great part about running these small meetings is that changes can happen quickly and easily – so, if anything doesn't work for you about these 1-on-1 meetings, change it! Be it timing, frequency, agenda or format, let none of it undiscovered!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>A week ago, I was looking for something to tinker with over the weekend. I ended up switching my site hosting from GitHub Pages to Netlify.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.netlify.com/github-pages-vs-netlify/">comparison was compelling</a>. I was appealed by the 1-click rollbacks, ability to use more Jekyll plug-ins, and A/B testing my site (fun!).</p>
<p>However, I switched back to GitHub Pages today. Why?</p>
<h2 id="my-mx-records-werent-migrated-automatically">My MX records werenâ€™t migrated automatically</h2>
<p>(MX records are DNS records for delivery email to your address.)</p>
<p>When I switched my DNS servers to Netlify, it was pretty painless: Update the DNS name servers, provision the cert, and weâ€™re good to go.</p>
<p>However, I didnâ€™t realize that my MX records werenâ€™t automatically migrated as well. (When I previously moved to Cloudflare, this was taken care of).</p>
<p>As a result, emails to my domain bounced for a few days before I noticed. Thankfully, people reached out via other channels to inform me of it.</p>
<h2 id="adding-mx-records-on-the-dns-provider-was-a-pain">Adding MX records on the DNS provider was a pain</h2>
<p>Trying to add the MX records with the DNS provider, NS1, was a pain.</p>
<p>I had to create an account with NS1 and provide them with credit card details. (Update: Was charged $2 within a day; will enquire why).</p>
<p>Then, I had to set up a â€œZoneâ€� to attach the MX records. However, when I tried setting up the zone for my domain, it was not allowed as the domain already exists. Probably from the Netlify integration.</p>
<p>I spent some time trying to figure this out. I also asked some Netlify folks. Turns out that while they use Netlify to host their site, they use other DNS providers (instead of NS1).</p>
<h2 id="adding-the-custom-certificate-didnt-work">Adding the custom certificate didnâ€™t work</h2>
<p>By now, Iâ€™ve switched my DNS provider back to Cloudflare, and added the Cloudflare Origin cert to my Netlify app. (I really wanted to continue using Netlify.)</p>
<p>However, I soon got complaints that people couldnâ€™t access my site due to the error: â€œPeerâ€™s Certificate issuer is not recognized.â€�. I faced the same issue too. Iâ€™m not sure where the issue lies (cert or host) but I had lost patience by now.</p>
<h2 id="another-gotcha-300-build-minutes-monthly">Another gotcha: 300 build minutes monthly</h2>
<p>While the <a href="https://www.netlify.com/github-pages-vs-netlify/">GitHub Pages vs Netlify comparison</a> indicates that both are free, with Netlify being superior at 3 builds a minute, it leaves out one major gotcha: On the free tier, Netlify only provides 300 minutes of build time monthly. AFAIK, GitHub Pages has no limitations.</p>
<p>For someone who frequently adds and tweaks content, and mucks around with the CSS and whatnot, 300 minutes didnâ€™t last long.</p>
<p>On its own, this limitation would have been bearableâ€”I figured I would try to be more frugal. But the DNS issues broke the camelâ€™s back.</p>
<h2 id="back-to-github-pages">Back to GitHub Pages</h2>
<p>Now, Iâ€™m back to hosting on GitHub Pages and merrily pushing updates as inspiration strikes. Previously, I was checking the build minutes remaining ever so often.</p>
<p>I guess Iâ€™ll have to do without the fancy Jekyll plug-ins, 3 builds/min, and A/B testing for now. In return, I get peace of mind.</p>

<section>
<div>
<p><em>Edit: Thank you to the 80k people who have read this piece. It looks like many people are struggling with the concept of "greatness". Let's continue to support one another on the journey there. </em></p><p>Over the years, we’ve all encountered our fair share of successes and failures. As I’ve acquired more of both under my name, I’ve started to contemplate which experiences were truly “great” and why.</p><p>Interestingly enough, I realized that it was not the sporadic highs that were exceptional, but instead the long hauls; the sequences of events that seemed minimal at each juncture, but compounded into major gains. This led me to think further about what <em>greatness</em> truly means. I’ve come to learn that it’s not about overnight successes or flashes of excellence, but periods of repeatable habits.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Perhaps “great’, is just “good”, but repeatable. </strong></em></blockquote><h2 id="consider-this">Consider This</h2><p>Before stepping into the bulk of this article, I want to clarify two things:</p><ul><li>Greatness is not instantaneous</li><li>Greatness is earned</li></ul><p>The first step in becoming great is recognizing that you’re likely not already great. In fact, it comes from recognizing that there is no such thing as greatness at a specific instance in time. Greatness is instead a reflection of a period of effort, since greatness in a single instance can be reduced to luck. </p><p>Moreover, being “great” is not about being better than someone else. It is about being dependable and disciplined, and ultimately it is earned. </p><p>Many people, in theory, want to be “great”. In fact, each month 1000 people search “how to be great”, 260 people search “how to become perfect”, and 2400 people search “how to be the best”, looking for discrete answers on how to get from 0 to 1. Yet, many people in life realistically do not want to put in the effort over a sustained period of time to actually get to 1. They are looking for the “secrets to success” that in many ways, do not exist. You know what brings success? Hard work brings success. </p><p>So before proceeding forward in this article, I implore each of you to consider that if greatness truly is a reflection of non-instantaneous, earned effort, ask yourself if that’s the life you’d like to live. Ask yourself whether you’d like to spend your days, weeks, months, and years in a constant uphill battle. </p><p>If you ultimately find that you don’t want to do that, that’s fine! It doesn’t make you less of a person. At least you’ve broken from the holding pattern of thinking you want to do X but not understanding why you haven’t gotten there yet. And if that’s the case, go enjoy your Netflix and chill completely guilt-free.</p><p>With that in mind, let’s dive into what truly makes someone “great’. </p><h2 id="it-s-hard-to-be-consistent">It’s Hard to be Consistent</h2><p>There’s a false impression that success or notoriety comes with being flashy. This notion comes from the media focusing on outliers, whether it be events or personalities which diverge from the norm. Not only can this encourage people to aim for notoriety just for the sake of it (think Elizabeth Holmes), but it makes the rest of us believe that correlation (of those outliers) is causation; in other words, success of those individuals is due to their offbeat ways. But here’s another storyline: the most sure and therefore the <em>best</em> way to “success” is through consistency.</p><blockquote><em>“Until you work as hard as those you admire, don’t explain away their success as luck.”</em> - James Clear, <a href="https://amzn.to/31t6vQZ">Atomic Habits</a></blockquote><p>To be clear, consistency isn’t necessarily the easiest way to success, but one that can be achieved with a higher level of certainty, rather than hoping for a lottery win or someone to “discover” you. Continuous effort is a more thoughtful approach that leads to greatness when the following statements are true:</p><ol><li>Inputs are consistent over time</li><li>Intentional inputs lead to expected outputs</li></ol><h3 id="consistency">Consistency<br></h3><blockquote><em>“No one who can rise before dawn three hundred sixty days a year fails to make his family rich”</em> - <a href="https://amzn.to/2Fcnn4K">Outliers</a></blockquote><p>There is a famous saying from Napolean Hill which says, <em>“If you cannot do great things, do small things in a great way”</em>. I would actually argue the quote should be, <em>“If you cannot do great things, do small things a great number of times”.</em></p><p>If you don’t have the opportunity to “do great things”, focus on consistently achieving small wins. These small things in fact do not need to be done in a great way, but a good way, repeatably. In fact, I would advise not to focus on perfection, as it is often the enemy of the successful. </p><p>There’s glimmer and hoopla around unpredictability, but in reality, it’s much more difficult and therefore impressive, to be predictably good. For example:</p><ul><li>It’s easy to wake up whenever you “feel like it”. </li><li>It’s hard to stick to a routine of getting up at 6AM.</li><li>It’s easy to pivot from side project to side project, focusing on the new shiny object of the month.</li><li>It’s hard to stick with a side project for years, many of which may not be profitable for a long while. </li><li>It’s easy to give up on someone when you hit a roadblock or the next potential partner becomes available. </li><li>It’s hard to be faithful and invest in a relationship for decades.</li></ul><p>We normally set out in life with good intentions. We <em>intend</em> to set a morning routine or work on a business until it's profitable or to “love someone forever”. We imagine that as we invest in something, we will naturally continue to move in the right direction. If anything, things will get easier, right?</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/NQV_7RXfM2ZYDJsT4E4JAaAW2i9KphrB7-fE8XveJlrW-Msf1aIot9ayls-wSCWIroq155Fzdz6vE3d8br71E6Tc5sTQRyhnT0Zb6EJCUoV41B5EoZSczjtWcHo9KV-T9c6s16Cb"></figure><p>The described trajectory is what we perceive on the left. Predictable, linear, and a direct reflection of effort put in. </p><p><strong>Rarely does success in anything look like that.</strong> Life is a series of tiny nodes that tend to look more like the right hand side. There two key elements worth calling out in the more realistic graph on the right:</p><ul><li>Compounding is always present. The earlier steps in any process will be more strenuous, yet it’s difficult to imagine the potential compounding that comes later on. </li><li>With the ups, there are always downs. This seems obvious, but we often forget this when we are in periods of down. We quit at these local minimums (the highlighted sections in red above), because we cannot see the next peak right around the corner. </li></ul><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>a friend just emailed me this note in response to my 'burn out' video. wanted to share;</p><p>'the addiction to having success is what makes you feel unsuccessful at the times when you're not feeling the immediate dopamine hit of your work 'succeeding' at that precise moment.'</p></div>— Casey Neistat (@Casey) <a href="https://twitter.com/Casey/status/1093520669286064133?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 7, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have lost our ability to appreciate delayed gratification and, some of us who struggle with perfectionism, can either create repeatedly until we ‘get it right’ never truly feeling fulfilled with our work, or, we avoid creating all together in fear of failing.</p>— Marcio Novelli (@MarcioNovelli) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarcioNovelli/status/1093522120536150017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 7, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>The local minima are especially psychologically taxing due to something called the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill">Hedonic treadmill</a> or hedonic adaptation. Essentially, as someone achieves new successes in various aspects of their lives, their baseline shifts to reflect that new level and therefore, their expectations and desires are re-established as well. There is no net gain in happiness and thus, it becomes even more difficult to stay “level-headed” during these down moments. </p><p>That is exactly why a specific search for success can be problematic and instead of looking for unsustainable shortcuts in life, it’s much more effective (and healthy) to aim for continuous habits that bring you success as a byproduct, not as the end goal.</p><blockquote><em>“The only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom.” - <a href="https://amzn.to/31t6vQZ">Atomic Habits</a>, James Clear</em></blockquote><p>On your journey to greatness, you need to fall in love with the process which includes many local minima and maxima. Staying consistent and pushing through both of these continuously is what will truly differentiate you from those that are simply “good” and isolate you as one of the few that are “great’.</p><h3 id="inputs-outputs">Inputs → Outputs</h3><p>The second important aspect of achieving greatness is acting with intention. Your actions and results will not always reflect your intentions, but as you move towards “greatness”, you should have a better idea of what inputs actually deliver output. You’ll still make mistakes﹣as we all do﹣but you’ll have a better grasp on what is more likely to work out. For example, your success rate may be 30%, versus someone flying blind with a 5% success rate. </p><p>Let’s look at a simple example:</p><p>Imagine company X has two sales people. Salesperson A happens to land a $1M deal in his first week. However, he struggles to land anything substantial for the next 6 months. Meanwhile, salesperson B manages to develop a process over the first month, bringing in only $100k which he’s able to scale up and double month over month.</p><p>After six months, this will be the revenue generated by each party.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.stephsmith.io/content/images/2019/05/image-5.png"></figure><p>You’re probably thinking… "So what? That’s just a classic example of compounding." </p><p>Yes! That’s exactly the point. The best things in life often aren’t miracles, but well-thought out approaches that are sustainable. The same thing is true with businesses, marriages, and just about anything with repeatable elements.

    <p>To capture your ideas and turn them into tangible products, mind mapping software is a must. During the brainstorming process, ideas happen quickly, and if not appropriately tracked, can become overwhelming.
There are many reasons that mind mapping software is the best solution for this. To fully understand the benefit it can provide to your organization, it’s best to explore the concept of mind mapping and how it helps bring projects to life.</p>

<h2>The concept of mind mapping</h2>
<p>The concept of mind mapping stems from extracting useful ideas and developing links between them. During the brainstorming process ideas flow freely, but sometimes connections are not immediately noticeable. This makes the process of putting these ideas together and creating plan for an entire project extremely difficult. This is where mind mapping plays a critical role.</p>
<p>The best way to describe a mind map is a hierarchical tree is it shows a natural progression between ideas. A mind map separates a project into modular components and then breaks those down into even more specific tasks.</p>
<h2>What is mind mapping software?</h2>
<p>Although mind-mapping is possible by hand, utilizing mind mapping software is a modern and more refined way to get the job done. Utilizing these mind mapping tools enables a project leader to visualize and build out their projects. Generating a mind map by hand can take quite a bit of time, so specialized mind mapping apps condense the process and streamline delivery.</p>
<h2>Best mind mapping software to improve your productivity</h2>
<p>Within the software world, many mind mapping solutions exist. It isn’t difficult to find software for any platform, including the cloud.

<h2>How to pick a mind map tool</h2>
<p>To pick the best mind mapping tool for your unique situation, there are a few factors that should be considered. Depending on your individual needs, you may find that some software lacks a few essential items that are critical for your purposes.
Here are the major factors that should play into your decision.</p>
<div>
    <h3>Team access</h3>
    <p>If you are working on a project that requires multiple team members to access mind maps and edit them simultaneously, you’ll need to consider this. Some mind mapping software does not allow for real-time editing, although it’s supported in most. If you need this feature, then consider Miro or Coggle.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>More than mind maps</h3>
    <p>If you plan on doing more than just mind-mapping for your project, you’ll need to keep this in mind when picking a mind mapping software. While all of the aforementioned software is excellent for mind mapping, some options stand out and are exemplary for other tasks and different diagram types. Mind Meister and Coggle allow for unparalleled customization of charts.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Integrations</h3>
    <p>If you intend to integrate your mind maps into social media or utilize existing technologies—such as Google Drive or Microsoft 365—you’ll need to make sure it’s supported with the mind mapping software you choose. Two excellent options for this are Mindmup and Miro.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Supported platforms</h3>
    <p>You’ll also need to consider which platforms are supported by each type of mind mapping software. If your organization is primarily Apple-based, you’ll need to select mind mapping software compatible with Mac. Your best bet is to choose an option that is cloud-based so it works across all platforms and devices.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Budget</h3>
    <p>Your last consideration will be your budget for mind mapping software. If you have a complex set of projects that need many detailed diagrams, you’ll need to make sure that you select a software option that fits with your budget and allows you the mind maps you need.</p>
</div>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, there are many different types of mind mapping software available that fit a variety of needs. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, so it’s best to make a list of your needs, and then start shopping to find the mind mapping software for you.
A great place to start would be to select a few of the options that offer free plans, and start creating a mind map focused on selecting the best mind mapping software. This will give you a real-world view of the features so you can select the software solution that’s right for you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>freespaceDAO</strong>  — hacking culture started in Hamburg and spawned the largest hackerspace for decades — citywide gentrification has cast out people and spaces for free thinking. The goal was to learn how a DAO could be useful in realigning incentives to allow these elements in society to recreate the spaces they lost.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>forestDAO</strong>  — if a forest could enlist agents to further its own means of survival— how would that look like? This raised the question of on-chain identity and whether a forest is sufficiently represented by encoding it in the incentive and governance structure of a DAO.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>poliDAO —</strong>  a multi-party system is great but even then raising attention (and funds) for grassroots movements that are small and localized remains inefficient not very scalable. Also, first-movers inside small grassroots movements often happen to hold more power than they might have to.<br>
It is this case that has been taken further and is now being actively studied for green grassroots movement in eastern Hamburg.</p>

		<div><p>I went into my office yesterday for the first time in a few months to pick some stuff up. We got notified
a couple of days ago to get any personal property out of the office before Thanksgiving or else it'd be
thrown out, so I guess we're moving out of the office<sup id="fnref:moving-out"><a href="#fn:moving-out">1</a></sup>. It was a pretty eerie place to be; even now, 8
months later, most people haven't been back and it kind of looks like the entire office was abducted by aliens in
early March.</p>

<p>Despite how weird it is, I still miss working out of the office.</p>
<!-- more -->

<p>I miss having a clean delineation between "work" and "home".</p>
<p>I miss having copious desk space and a big monitor<sup id="fnref:house"><a href="#fn:house">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I miss the 48" TVs on the wall showing Grafana dashboards with key metrics so there was always ambient knowledge of
what was going on with the product.</p>
<p>I miss having meetings in conference rooms where you can see other people and have a giant whiteboard to sketch on.</p>
<p>I miss casual collaboration. Video chat is a poor substitute and Slack is a deeply irritating tool that combines the
worst aspects of synchronous and asynchronous communication.</p>
<p>I miss productivity! Our engineering productivity has fallen through the floor since COVID despite everyone
working longer and harder; I fundamentally do not think remote teams can <em>ever</em> be as productive as in-person teams.</p>
<p>I miss having my employer pay for electricity and heat and fast symmetric multi-gigabit Internet access instead of
shifting those costs to me.</p>
<p>I miss having a plethora of convenient and delicious options for take-out lunch! I miss the gyros and french fries
at <a href="https://www.ayolagreek.com/">Ayola</a>. I miss the chicken pesto sandwich at <a href="https://working-girls-cafe.square.site/">Working Girls'
Cafe</a>. I miss the chow mein and pork buns from <a href="https://yanksing.com/">Yank Sing</a>. I
miss the katsu curry from <a href="http://www.muraccis.com/">Muracci's</a>. I miss the curry burritos from <a href="https://www.curryupnow.com/">Curry Up
Now</a>. I miss the croque monsieur from <a href="https://cafemadeleinesf.com/">Cafe Madeline</a>. I
miss the $5 lunch specials from <a href="http://www.mehfilindian.com/">Mehfil</a>.</p>
<p>I miss the succession of friendly baristas at our <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/hermanos-coffee-juice-san-francisco">favorite coffee shop</a> who always knew our orders and put up with our banter.</p>
<p>I miss occasional after-work drinks at the <a href="https://sf.eater.com/2019/4/25/18516128/skydeck-spirits-in-the-sky-rooftop-bar-san-francisco">sky bar</a> with the $18 well drinks that we always convinced management to pay for.</p>
<p>Hell, I miss <a href="https://www.bart.gov/">BART</a> in all its loud and smelly glory.</p>
<p>Look, I know, it's not all bad. It's a lot easier taking care of a baby while working from home than it would be if
I were commuting 45 minutes each way every day. I'm spending a lot less money on food and coffee and BART. And I'm
not arguing that we should be in the office now; not a single one of those things I listed above is worth the health
risk of jamming 150 people<sup id="fnref:deniers"><a href="#fn:deniers">3</a></sup> into an open-plan office with a quasi-functional ventilation
system<sup id="fnref:ventilation"><a href="#fn:ventilation">4</a></sup>. But I
really hope that office-work isn't a permanent victim of this pandemic, that all the companies pushing for
permanent WFH to save a few bucks on rent reconsider their stances, and that there comes a time when I can go back to
work again.</p>

November 21, 2020 | https://yakshav.es/the-patron-saint-of-yakshaves/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://yakshav.es/the-patron-saint-of-yakshaves/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>In 2015, I gave a talk in which I called <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/skade/tex-the-ultimate-yakshave">Donald Knuth the Patron Saint of Yak Shaves</a>. The reason is that Donald Knuth achieved the most perfect and long-running yak shave: TeX.</p>
<p>I figured this is worth repeating.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-achieve-the-ultimate-yak-shave">How to achieve the ultimate Yak Shave</h2>
<p>The ultimate yak shave is the combination of improbable circumstance, the privilege to be able to shave at your hearts will and the will to follow things through to the end. Here’s the way it was achieved with TeX. The recount is purely mine, inaccurate and obviously there for fun. I’ll avoid the most boring facts that everyone always tells, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth_reward_check">why Knuth’s checks have their own Wikipedia page</a>.</p>
<p>So, let’s get things started.</p>
<h2 id="the-pre-shave">The Pre-Shave</h2>
<p>TeX was invented to typeset a book. No plural. It was invented to typeset the second edition of “The Art of Computer Programming”. The second edition had to be typeset again, as “hot type” typesetting, which was used for the first edition, was not available anymore. Being unimpressed by the available options, Knuth decided to write his own system, which later ended up as TeX.</p>
<p>But “The Art of Computer Programming” is an impressive book in its own right: it is still unfinished, currently spanning 3.5 volumes (yes, the fourth is unfinished, but the first chapters are released). It was called a book of the century by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080820030403/http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/100-or-so-books-that-shaped-a-century-of-science">American scientist writers</a>.</p>
<p>Yak shave -2: Write a book of the century</p>
<p>Digging deeper into TAOCP, it already shows the works of a yak shaver destined for greater things. All programs in this book refer to a common assembly language: MIX. Which was invented for the book.</p>
<p>Yak shave -1: Invent your own computer for illustration purposes</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>The first version of TeX was implemented using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAIL_(programming_language)">SAIL</a> programming language. It was later replaced by WEB. What’s WEB? It’s a programming language, invented by… You’ll have guessed it by now, Donald Knuth. It transpiles to PASCAL. Knuth transpiled the WEB before it was cool.</p>
<p>Yak shave 1: Somewhere along the road, implement your own programming language…</p>
<p>WEB is a special language: in WEB, any bare text is just text. It’s interleaved with marked pieces of code, which are later used for the program code. The documentation can be run through a special program to produce… a TeX file. The concept is called “literate programming” and was introduced by… Donald Knuth.</p>
<p>Yak shave 2: Invent your own programming paradigm for it</p>
<p>But, what does TeX do? Mainly, it does text layout and a couple of other things. Knuth being known for research on algorithms couldn’t do without coming up with his own algorithm, later published together with Michael Plass. What does the algorithm do? It finds a visually pleasing way to lay out a paragraph on a page without making line breaks look jarring (for example by adjusting the “glue”, the whitespace between words). Here’s a <a href="https://www.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca/~cs490/2015W2/lectures/Knuth.pdf">nice explanation</a>.</p>
<p>It’s still considered good and has a huge factor in the recognisable look of TeX documents.</p>

<p>Which brings us to the next problem: <em>what</em> does this thing lay out? Generically speaking: objects and clusters of objects of varying sizes. Interestingly, that’s what TeX deals with, it has no concept of a character other then dimensions.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these are usually characters and characters are provided by fonts. Fonts must usually be licensed at a fee and free fonts weren’t so available in the 70s.</p>
<p>Another very recognisable feature of TeX documents that they are often set in a font called “Computer Modern”.</p>
<p>I’m trying to make this whole thing a bit more thrilling, so I will let you guess who created that one.</p>
<p>Yak shave 4: Design a font</p>
<p>Fonts need to be authored. Usually, they are described in some vector description, often Bézier curves. This is fairly standard and not an innovation of Knuth. <em>But</em>, he wrote a description language for that, along with an interpreter to turn this descriptions into proper font files. This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metafont">METAFONT</a>. It’s not strictly part of TeX, it’s just that the Yak happened to stand close.</p>
<p>Yak shave 5: Write an authoring tool for fonts</p>
<p>As a side-note, METAFONT was later evolved into METAPOST for generic vector drawings, which has the one feature I still miss from many modern graphics description languages: the ability to describe an (addressable) point as the intersection between two other primitives.</p>
<p>Another side-note: both TeX and METAFONT still see releases, at a slow pace. TeX is currently at version 3.14159265, METAFONT at 2.7182818. Yep, TeX is slowly converging towards pi, while METAFONT towards e. Take that, semantic versioning advocates!</p>
<p>Yak shave 6: Come up with your own versioning scheme<br>
Yak shave 7: Avoid adoption of it for greater good</p>
<p>We’re not done yet. We can layout text (and other things), but where do we convert it to? Now, everyone knows the horror printers invoke, so no one wants to deal with those directly. Classic TeX instead converts things to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_independent_file_format">DVI</a>, the “device independent” format. I don’t know many details about it, except what’s on the wiki page, which feels the need to specifically point out that “DVI is not a document encryption format”. It is again a stack-based language (in contrast to PostScript not turing complete), which can then be interpreted through a driver, which would then send that to whatever target (a printer, PDF or such). It was designed by…</p>
<p>David R. Fuchs, Knuth just wrote the implementation.</p>
<p>Yak shave 8: Implement a custom language for printable documents</p>
<p>Note that I haven’t mentioned that TeX is an… interesting… language by itself, but I don’t consider that a yak shave, this was just the implementation.</p>
<p>That makes most of the initial implementation complete. Which means, in orderly fashion, you should give matters in the hand of the community.</p>

<p>Since the release of TeX, the community has been busy working on using it as a platform. If you ever downloaded the full TeX distribution, please bear in mind that you are downloading the amassed work of over 40 years, to make sure that each and every TeX document ever written builds. We’re talking about documents here.</p>
<p>But mostly, two big projects sprung out of that. The first is LaTeX by Leslie Lamport. Lamport is a very productive researcher, famous for research in formal methods through TLA+ and also known laying groundwork for many distributed algorithms. LaTeX is based on the idea of seperating presentation and content. It is based around the idea of document classes, which then describe the way a certain document is layed out. Think Markdown, just much more complex. The second is ConTeXt, which is far more focused on fine grained layout control.</p>
<p>Both share a common property:</p>
<p>Community yak shave 1: Create not one, but two programs that are very ungoogleable… Before Google is invented.</p>
<p>Being active in a language that has lingo built around “Rust”, “Cargo” and “manifests”, I feel right at home.</p>
<p>Now, the community also wants to evolve TeX: a lot has changed over the years in technology, so, for example, you’d like to use modern font formats, directly write to modern output formats or use this new UTF-8 thingy. For that, there are specialised TeX interpreters, such as <code>pdf(la)tex</code>, <code>lua(la)tex</code> and <code>xe(la)tex</code>. There’s a problem here: you are not allowed to change TeX and distribute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX#License">it under that name</a>. The thinking here is that if you have a <code>tex</code> binary, you can compile any valid TeX from the past and from the future.</p>
<p>The first issue on that road is that WEB isn’t really a popular programming language, neither is PASCAL and running it on modern systems is a bit of a pain. Which means…</p>
<p>Community yak shave 2: Transpile WEB to C and work from there</p>
<p>This is just the start of a great endeavour…</p>
<p>Community yak shave 3: Build a lot of tooling around that</p>
<h2 id="the-moral-of-the-story">The Moral of the Story</h2>
<p>Whenever you feel like “can’t we just replace this whole thing, it can’t be so hard” when handling TeX, don’t forget how many years of work and especially knowledge were poured into that system. Typesetting isn’t the <em>most</em> popular knowledge around programmers. Especially see it in the context of the space it is in: they can’t remove legacy. Ever. That would break documents.</p>
<p>TeX is also not a programming language. It might resemble one, but mostly, it should be approached as a typesetting system first. A lot of its confusing lingo gets much better then. It’s not programming lingo.</p>
<p>By approaching TeX with an understanding for its history, a lot of things can be learned from it. And yes, a replacement would be great, but it would take ages.</p>
<p>In any case, I hope I thoroughly convinced you why Donald Knuth is the Patron Saint of Yak Shaves.</p>

<p>This comes out of a enjoyable discussion with <a href="https://lambdaisland.com/">Arne from Lambda Island</a>, who listened and said “you should totally turn this into a talk”.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf">eqaf</a>, a constant-time compare function implementation in <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>, is a great case to demonstrate the <a href="https://signalsandthreads.com/language-design/#0008401">predictable performance of OCaml’s compiler</a>. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>The goal of a constant-time compare function is to avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack">timing attacks</a>, which requires fully deterministic and predictable runtime performance.</li>
<li>Usually, cryptography functions are written in assembly to have total control of resulting binary and avoid unneeded optimization by the compiler.</li>
<li>However, <a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf">eqaf</a> showed us that you can write clean OCaml and get simple and predictable resulting assembly.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2 id="about-garbage-collection">About Garbage Collection</h2>
<p>It’s hard to have a stable runtime performance for languages that comes with a garbage collector. To have a predictable runtime performance characteristic in these languages, the following rules are usually required to be followed religiously:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid garbage collections by avoiding memory allocations.</li>
<li>Avoid boxed values to generate assembly as low-level as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, the resulting code are usually unidiomatic and hard to maintain.</p>
<h2 id="compiler-explorer">Compiler Explorer</h2>
<p><a href="https://godbolt.org/">Compiler Explorer</a> is a handy tool for exploring compilers and its assembly output. It has built-in OCaml support and removes boilerplate automatically. I recommend you to test the following example with it.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="code">Code</h2>
<p>Here’s the implementation of <code>eqaf</code>’s <code>equal</code>.</p>

  <span>then</span> false
  <span>else</span> equal <span>~</span>ln<span>:</span>al a b
</code></pre></div><p>Besides basic OCaml syntaxes[1], interesting bits in the example are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can force OCaml to always inline a function via adding an attribute <code>[@inline]</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>String.unsafe_get</code> works like <code>String.get</code> but without bound-checking. It’s unsafe for most use-cases but it’s used here to <a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf/blob/master/lib/eqaf.ml#L3">avoid jumping to exception</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OCaml provides a FFI <code>external</code> for <a href="https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/intfc.html">interfacing with C</a>. Here we use it to call a primitive function provided by OCaml’s runtime <code>%caml_string_get16u</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>external</code> is always unsafe and should be really take care about.</li>
<li>Primitives are not stable. For example: <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-base64/pull/36">https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-base64/pull/36</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>n asr m</code> shifts <code>n</code> to the right by <code>m</code> bits. This is an arithmetic shift: the sign bit of <code>n</code> is replicated. The result is unspecified if <code>m &lt; 0</code> or <code>m &gt; Sys.int_size</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ref</code> creates a <a href="https://dev.realworldocaml.org/imperative-programming.html">reference cell</a> and allows in-place replacement with <code>:=</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>pred x</code> is <code>x - 1</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>lor</code>, <code>lxor</code>, and <code>land</code> are logical bit-wise <code>or</code>, <code>xor</code>, and <code>and</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the OCaml code is quite low-level (and not very functional). It’s still cleaner than most constant-time compare functions implemented in assembly.</p>

<p>Here’s the resulting assembly of the previous example, copied from the <code>eqaf</code> <a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf/blob/master/lib/eqaf.ml">source</a>. You can get the same output via <a href="https://godbolt.org/">Compiler Explorer</a>.</p>

<h2>Public Notice of Sale: CBQ, LLC and Carl Buddig Company – Auction of 191,075 lbs. of St. Louis Style Ribs</h2>
<p>CBQ, LLC and Carl Buddig Company (“CBQ”) is offering for sale pursuant to 810 Ill. Comp. Ann. 5/2-706 approximately 191,075 lbs. of frozen St. Louis Style ribs. CBQ advises that it is selling the ribs because Canadian American Boxed Meat Corp. refused to return the purchase price after CBQ revoked its acceptance of the ribs. CBQ advises it revoked its acceptance because the ribs contained metal particles from rusted, galvanized steel and 400-series steel. The ribs are located at 15600 Wentworth Ave., South Holland, IL 60473. The CBQ is selling the ribs “as-is” “where-is” with no warranties or representations of any kind. Prospective purchasers may inspect samples of the ribs at the above location by contacting Peter Maciejewski at <a href="https://www.dailydac.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="8cfce9f8e9fee1cceef9e8e8e5eba2efe3e1a2">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> Prospective purchasers may submit bids by emailing them to Peter Maciejewski at <a href="https://www.dailydac.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="c1b1a4b5a4b3ac81a3b4a5a5a8a6efa2aeac">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> on or before November 27, 2020 at 5:00 p.m. All bids must be firm offers and must provide for payment in immediately available funds, FOB at the address above within 3 business days of acceptance.

                <p>Most styles are editable through <em>CSS variables</em>. You can also add your own styles
                    inline, at the end of MVP.css or in a new stylesheet.</p>
                <p><sup>PRO TIP</sup> If there are two conflicting CSS styles, the last one will take precedence.</p>
                <pre>                    <code>
:root {
    --color: #118bee;
}

/* Lower in the CSS, or in a 2nd stylesheet */

:root {
    --color: green; /* This will take precedence */
}
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>What if I still don't like it?</summary>
                <p>That's OK, you probably shouldn't love your MVP. The goal of MVP.css is to help you
                    feel <i>slightly</i> less embarrased about it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SierpinskiSieve.html">Sierpinski triangle</a> is a famous mathematical figure which presents an interesting computer science problem: how to go about generating it. In this article I'll explain one method of generating the Sierpinski triangle recursively, with an implementation written in Vanilla JavaScript using HTML5 canvas. I'll also explain how to you'd go about downloading the contents of an HTML5 Canvas element as a PNG.</p>
<p>First, here's what the Sierpinski triangle looks like:</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/generating-the-sierpinski-triangle-in-vanilla-javascript-with-html5-canvas-with-some-mathematical-background/sierpinski-triangle.jpg" alt="The Sierpinski Triangle"></p>
<h2>What is the Sierpinski Triangle?</h2>
<h3>The Sierpinski Triangle is a Fractal, Making it Naturally Recursive</h3>
<p>One initial thing to notice about the Sierpinski triangle is that every triangle is composed of smaller, identical triangles. Those triangles are also made up of even smaller, identical triangles, which are also made up of more triangles, and so on.</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/generating-the-sierpinski-triangle-in-vanilla-javascript-with-html5-canvas-with-some-mathematical-background/fractal.jpg" alt="Sierpinski Triangle Fractal"></p>
<p>This property in which the Sierpinski triangle is made up of identical, scaled-down copies of itself makes it a <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Fractal.html">fractal</a> in mathematics. Fractals are shapes that are made up of scaled down copies of themselves. The Sierpinski triangle is actually arguably one of the most famous fractals that exist, along with <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PythagorasTree.html">Pythagoras Trees</a>, <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/MandelbrotSet.html">the Mandelbrot set</a>, and more.</p>
<p>The fact that fractals are made up of copies of themselves makes them naturally recursive, and it tends to be simpler to programmatically generate fractals recursively as supposed to using an iterative approach.</p>
<h3>The Sierpinski Triangle Only Uses Equilateral Triangles</h3>
<p>Next, notice how the Sierpinski triangle is made up of a single shape: the equilateral triangle. This is not a coincidence, and it is in fact one of the reasons the Sierpinski triangle is a notable mathematical figure.</p>
<p>The Sierpinski triangle takes advantage of a property of equilateral triangles: that they are one of the only shapes that can be made up solely by scaled down versions of itself, where a large equilateral triangle can be made by tesselating four equally smaller equilateral triangles. This makes them uniquely positioned to be the centerpiece of simple fractals, since it is intuitive to encompass smaller copies of an equilateral triangle inside a larger one.</p>
<p>This also makes it possible for fractals based on equilateral triangles, like the Sierpinski triangle, to be composed of only one shape. Other polygon-based fractals that don't use equilateral triangles often include several different shapes.</p>
<h2>Generating the Sierpinski Triangle in JavaScript with HTML5 Canvas</h2>
<h3>Setting Up the HTML and Canvas Element</h3>
<p>Let's start by setting up the <code>canvas</code> element and basic HTML markup:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Sierpinski Triangle&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;canvas id="canvas" width="1000" height="1000"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;

    &lt;!-- JavaScript Code Here --&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Note that the width and height variables in the canvas represent the inner dimensions of the canvas, not necessarily its size on the page. This means it can be resized in the future to fit different screen sizes, while maintaining its inner dimensions of 1000px by 1000px.</p>
<h3>Creating Equilateral Triangles on the Canvas in JavaScript</h3>
<p>Since equilateral triangles are the only shape used in the Sierpinski triangle, it makes sense to write a utility function to draw a given equilateral triangle on the canvas at a specified position and of a specified size.</p>
<p>This function will take in two arguments: the position of the bottom left vertex on the triangle (<code>pos</code>), and the length of the sides of the triangle (<code>sidelen</code>).</p>
<p>To create polygons in HTML5 canvas, there are several functions to move to positions on the canvas, draw a path around an area of the canvas, and fill in that area. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>context.beginPath()</code> and <code>context.closePath()</code> — create and close a path; commonly used with <code>context.fill()</code> after closing the path</li>
<li><code>context.moveTo(x, y)</code> — move to a position on the canvas.</li>
<li><code>context.lineTo(x, y)</code> — move to a position on the canvas while drawing a line from the current position.</li>
<li><code>context.fill()</code> — fill the most recent canvas path.</li>
</ul>
<p>Creating a triangle simply means identifying the positions of the three vertices, drawing a path around those vertices, and filling the drawn area with a color. Identifying the positions of the vertices is pretty intuitive. Below is a visual showing the positions of the vertices. Note that the height of an equilateral triangle is mathematically equal to as <code>sin(Pi/3) * sidelen</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/generating-the-sierpinski-triangle-in-vanilla-javascript-with-html5-canvas-with-some-mathematical-background/equilateral-triangle.jpg" alt="Equilateral Triangle Vertex Positions"></p>
<p>With the positions of the vertices done, here's what the function to create an equilateral triangle on the canvas would look like:</p>
<pre><code>const c = document.getElementById("canvas");
const ctx = c.getContext("2d"); // context variable is used to draw on a 2D plane

const createTriangle = (pos, sidelen) =&gt; {
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.moveTo(...pos); // go to the left vertex

  // note that (0,0) in canvas is the top left, so 'up' on the vertical component would use substraction.
  ctx.lineTo(pos[0] + sidelen / 2, pos[1] - sidelen * Math.sin(Math.PI/3)); // draw line from left vertex to top vertex
  ctx.lineTo(pos[0] + sidelen, pos[1]); // draw line from top vertex to right vertex
  ctx.lineTo(...pos); // draw line from right vertex back to left vertex
  ctx.closePath();
  ctx.fill(); // fill triangle
};</code></pre>
<h3>Implementing an Algorithm to Generate the Sierpinski Triangle</h3>
<p>Now that the canvas and HTML has been set up and the <code>createTriangle</code> utility function has been written, we can start implementing an algorithm to generate the Sierpinski triangle.</p>
<p>Since fractals are naturally recursive, we'll use a recursive approach to generate the entire triangle.</p>
<p>First, recall that every triangle in the Sierpinski triangle is made up of three smaller triangles, one on the left, another on the right, and a final one on the top. Each smaller triangle is a copy of the outer triangle, the Sierpinski triangle. So, simply create a smaller Sierpinski triangle inside of each of the three triangles, and then more smaller Sierpinski triangles inside of those, and so on. Technically, the Sierpinski triangle repeats forever, but for visualizations like this, a stopping point should be defined when there have been enough repeats that the smallest triangles are hard to make out. At this point, filling in the smallest triangles acts as an effective substitution of repeating further.</p>
<p>To create this stopping condition, a variable called <code>depth</code> can be used. <code>depth</code> would represent the amount of times the program should continue repeating the fractal. <code>depth</code> should start at a certain value and decrease for every repeat, and every smaller Sierpinski triangle created. Once <code>depth</code> reaches zero (the base case), the program would stop and fill in the three triangles instead of continuing to repeat the fractal.</p>
<p>To create this functionality, let's create a function called <code>createSierpinskiTriangle</code> which takes the position of the Sierpinski triangle to generate, its side length, and the depth. The function should identify the positions of the three inner triangles, draw them if depth is equal to zero, or call <code>createSierpinskiTriangle</code> on the three inner triangles if the depth is greater than zero.</p>
<p>Here's what this would look like:</p>
<pre><code>const createSierpinskiTriangle = (pos, sidelen, depth) =&gt; {
  const innerTriangleSidelen = sidelen / 2; // side length of inner triangles is half the side length of the outer triangle
  const innerTrianglesPositions = [
    pos,
    [ pos[0] + innerTriangleSidelen, pos[1] ],
    [ pos[0] + innerTriangleSidelen / 2, pos[1] - Math.sin(Math.PI/3) * innerTriangleSidelen ]
  ]; // these positions are the same as what was used in the createTriangle function
  if(depth == 0) {
    innerTrianglesPositions.forEach((trianglePosition) =&gt; {
      createTriangle(trianglePosition, innerTriangleSidelen);
    });
  } else {
    innerTrianglesPositions.forEach((trianglePosition) =&gt; {
      createSierpinskiTriangle(trianglePosition, innerTriangleSidelen, depth - 1);
    });
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>To call the function, draw the Sierpinski triangle at the bottom left of the canvas (<code>(0, 1000)</code>) with a side length of <code>1000</code>px (the width of the canvas) and a depth of <code>5</code>.</p>
<pre><code>createSierpinskiTriangle([0, 1000], 1000, 5);</code></pre>
<p>Here's the result:</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/generating-the-sierpinski-triangle-in-vanilla-javascript-with-html5-canvas-with-some-mathematical-background/sierpinski-triangle.jpg" alt="Recursive Method Result"></p>
<p>Try increasing the depth, and you should see that the triangle gets more and more detailed. Increasing the depth by one will result in three times the amount of total triangles to be drawn, so very high depths like 20 might not be performant since the canvas would have to draw 3^20 (~3.5 billion) triangles.</p>
<h3>Downloading the Generated Triangle From the Canvas as a PNG</h3>
<p>Now that we've generated the triangle recursively, one thing you may want to do is download the generated Sierpinski triangle as an image on your computer. Luckily, this is very simple to do in HTML5 Canvas.</p>
<p>First, the canvas must be converted to a data URL. If you're not familiar with data URLs, here's a simple definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A data URL is a URL scheme that allows data and files (images, audio files, etc.) to be respresented in a single URL containing all of the data. For example, if one wanted to include an image on a website, you would add the image to the web server and link to it in the HTML. With data URLs, the data URL contains the contents of the entire file, so it can simply be put into the HTML directly. This is useful in canvas because we want to export the image without it having a specific public URL, and data URLs allow that to be done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The contents of the <code>canvas</code> element can be converted to a data URL with the <code>.toDataURL</code> method.</p>
<p>Next, let's download the data URL into the user's machine. In HTML, downloading a file is done by clicking a link and specifying the <code>download</code> attribute. For example, here's how someone would download an image as <code>myimage.png</code> when the user clicks a link: <code>&lt;a href="image.png" download="myimage.png"&gt;download!&lt;/a&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Downloading a file through JavaScript is as simple as creating a link element with the specified <code>href</code> and <code>download</code> attributes, and artificially clicking on it.</p>
<p>Here's what this would look like:</p>
<pre><code>const downloadCanvasContents = () =&gt; {
  const link = …</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Probability is a measure defined on events, which are sets of primitive outcomes. Probability theory mostly comes down to constructing events and measuring them. A measure is a generalization of size which corresponds to length, area, and volume (rather than the bijective mapping definition of cardinality).</p>

<p>The first half of this article is ostensibly devoted to explaining the definition of probability, but that is not my priority. I’m most interested in providing a useful conceptual map, asking and discussing interesting questions, and developing intuition. I provide many links to technical details and further readings. My opening exposition on definitions is brief. If it does not all make sense, please look at other resources. Hopefully this article at least makes those other sources easier to use.</p>

<p>This post is also a pedagogical experiment. I structured this article to be read twice. The first pass is without measure theory, and the second pass is with measure theory. Measure-theory content is hidden by default, e.g. <span><span>like this</span></span>. Simply ignore <span><span>purple text</span></span> the <span><span>first time</span><label for="796b5f2304883e2b8a1737199bea4fcbd95c2af7"> ⊕</label><span><span>Unless you are already acquainted with measure theory, but then you can just look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_axioms#Axioms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia’s definition of probability</a> to understand the gist of probability theory.</span></span></span> you read this post. Then in the <a href="#primer-to-measure-theory">measure theory section</a> at the end of this post you will see a button to show all the hidden text (and you can just click on <span><span>purple text</span></span> anywhere in the post to show it).</p>

<p>Why? Because I see plenty of introductions to probability that leave out measure theory entirely. The problem with them is that a lot of the common probability notation, e.g. random variables, only really makes sense when you understand measures. On the other hand, if you crack open a rigorous text on probability theory (e.g. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/383472.Statistical_Inference" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Casella &amp; Berger</a> or <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387953823" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shao</a>), it may not be obvious why all this extra complexity with events, sigma-algebras and measure spaces is necessary.</p>

<p>When learning about probability and measure theory myself, I wish I had a resource that both provides precise definitions and intuitions for why these definitions are the way they are, and without wading through a lot of extraneous details. I don’t know if I’ve succeeded in that here, but this is my attempt.</p>



<h2 id="beginner"><a href="#beginner">Beginner</a></h2>

<p>The full definition of probability is below, but to avoid overwhelm, you may first look at this <em>attempt</em> at defining probability. Many people intuitively think of probability this way. Notably, I’ve left out the event space.</p>

<p><strong>Sample set</strong> $\Omega$ is a set of all possible <span><span>samples</span><label for="46f0a5784f51b77c385f44317a48bc352dcfb439"> ⊕</label><span><span>Sample is synonymous with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_(probability)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">outcome</a>.</span></span></span> $\omega\in\Omega$.

<p>The beginner definition above does not define an event space. This is actually a problem when working with uncountable sample spaces, because not all subsets of an uncountable space can be measured. If that statement confuses you, don’t worry about it and read through this post. Then read my <a href="#primer-to-measure-theory">primer to measure theory</a> at the end which outlines why not every set can be measured. Though this may seem like a minor technicality, specifying what sets can be measured allows probability theory to be <span><span>a lot more general than it otherwise could be,</span><label for="a0359426bd6a552c43a72d1b7b5e568b41b95f0d"> ⊕</label><span><span>This is Kolmogorov’s achievement.

<p>Here is a compact but complete definition of probability:</p>
<ul>
  <li>

      <li>
<strong>Sample</strong> $\omega \in \Omega$ (i.e. primitive outcome) is a possible state of the world. Samples are disjoint, meaning only one sample can be the case at a time. Samples can be any kind of mathematical object.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Event space</strong> $E \subseteq 2^\Omega$ is the set of subsets of $\Omega$ for which we are <span><span>allowed to assign probability.</span><label for="f8b43cebd8d878851c96f6b83253241ae0914c18"> ⊕</label><span><span>The sets omitted from $E$ are not measurable, but again if you are not familiar with measure theory don’t worry about why some sets cannot be measured until the end of this post.</span></span></span> We require that $\emptyset, \Omega \in E$ <span><span>and $E$ is required to be a <a href="#sigma-algebra">$\sigma$-algebra</a> that contains the measurable subsets of $\Omega$. The tuple $(\Omega, E)$ is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurable_space" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">measurable space</a>.</span></span>
    <ul>
      <li>

  <li>
<strong>Probability measure</strong> <span><span>$P : E \to [0, 1]$</span><label for="4ad9ab16708369ac059ab042be9927eff00636f9"> ⊕</label><span><span>In general a measure $Q : E \to \real_{\geq 0}$, but I’m including the restriction of the co-domain to the unit interval $[0, 1]$ in the definition of , because we are only talking about probability measures here, and there’s no reason to be more general.</span></span></span> is a function that maps allowed subsets of $\Omega$ to the real unit interval. $P$ is a <strong>measure</strong>, which means it satisfies certain properties that make it behave analogous to length, area, volume, etc. in Euclidean space. Essentially, a measure is a generalization of size that satisfies the following properties:
    <ul>
      <li><span><span><strong>Measurable domain</strong>: $E$ is a $\sigma$-algebra of measurable sets.</span></span></li>
      <li>

<p>The triple $(\Omega, E, P)$ defines a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_space" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">probability space</a> <span><span>which is also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_space" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">measure space</a>.</span></span> These three objects are all we need to do probability calculations.</p>

<h2 id="kolmogorov-axioms-of-probability"><a href="#kolmogorov-axioms-of-probability">Kolmogorov axioms of probability</a></h2>

<p>You may have heard of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_axioms#Axioms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kolmogorov axioms of probability</a>. Kolmogorov formalized probability as a special case of measure theory. Essentially a probability measure is a normalized measure, i.e. assigns 1 to the entire sample space $\Omega$. Above, I’ve merged the axioms of measure theory with Kolmogorov’s axioms. For reference, here are Kolmogorov’s axioms given separately:</p>
<ol>
  <li>$P(e) \in [0, 1], \forall e \in E$, where $[0, 1] \subset \real$.</li>
  <li>$P(\Omega) = 1$, i.e. probability of anything happening is 1.</li>
  <li><span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma_additivity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$\sigma$-additivity</a> on $E$.</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><span>Given the axioms of measure theory, we can define probability succinctly by simply stating that $(\Omega, E, P)$ is a measure space where $P(\Omega) = 1$ (see <a href="https://terrytao.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/measure-book1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terence Tao’s Introduction to Measure Theory</a>).</span></span></p>

<p><strong>Finite</strong>: Dice rolls</p>

<p>,<br>
,<br>
.</p>

<p>Note that  is not defined. $P$ measures the “size” of sets.  is the set containing one sample. We can also compute the probability of larger sets, e.g.<br>

,<br>
.</p>

<p><strong>Countable</strong> (event set): Variable length binary sequences</p>

<p> is the binary alphabet.<br>
Let $x \in \bin^n$ be a binary sequence of any length $n$, and  returns the length of $x$.</p>

<p>The sample set is all infinite binary sequences, .<br>
This let’s us make an event for each finite length $x$.<br>
Let , where  is the length $\len{x}$ prefix of $\omega$.<br>
The event set is </p>

<p>Then  is the probability of $x$, and  is the probability of the set .<br>
Note that the probability of a finite sequence is always a marginal probability, in the sense that  where  and  are the concatenations of  with 0 or 1.</p>

<p>An example of such a measure is the uniform measure, .</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
		
		<span>November 20 2020</span>
		
		<p>In the latest chapter of <a href="https://www.thegadhian.com/posts/getting-your-shit-together">getting my shit together</a>, I've moved all my notes from <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> to <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>. In this post, I talk a bit about why I think it's cool, and how I use it on my mobile.</p>
<h2>What is Obsidian?</h2>
<p>Obsidian is the latest in the recent vogue of "Second Brain" apps. Essentially it's a place to take notes, and capture ``[[relationships]]` between those notes, resulting in something like your own personal Wikipedia.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.thegadhian.com/posts/using-obsidian-with-termux-and-vim/obsidian.png" alt="My knowledge graph in Obsidian"></p>
<h2>How do I use it?</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Daily Notes</strong>: this is where I spend most of my time, capturing anything interesting that happened that day, tasks that come up etc. If something warrants more thought, I'll later turn it into a note of it's own.</li>
<li><strong>Work</strong>: I'll usually keep note files for people (to store notes from 1-1s, anything interesting about them), projects, and occasionally meetings - relating them all together. I'll also create separate notes for any opnions that I'm forming.</li>
<li><strong>Learning</strong>: anything I'm learning about, or reading/watching that I might want to remember later will have a note.</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't really know if it's <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/#the-introduction-to-the-zettelkasten-method">zettelkasten</a>, <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes">evergreen notes</a>, or <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/what-is-gtd/">GTD</a>, or <a href="https://bulletjournal.com/">bullet journaling</a>. It doesn't really matter.</p>
<h2>Why switch from Notion?</h2>
<p>Notion is great, and definitely does a lot of things better than Obsidian does (particularly in the project management space). I had an awfully elaborate setup with Notion, with all sorts of relational databases. I found that this added a lot of overhead, both for capturing notes and navigating them.</p>
<p>The selling point of Obsidian for me was that all the notes are (more or less) regular markdown, and stored on <a href="https://plaintextproject.online/index.html">plain text files</a> on your own hard drive. There was something rather romantic about the idea of actually owning your own thoughts. Even if the app disappears one day, my notes will still be there in a usable format.</p>
<p>This emphasis on just writing text, and navigating organically through the graph feels like it's led to me writing more.</p>
<h2>What about mobile?</h2>
<p>The caveat was that Obsidian currently only has a desktop app. It's on their <a href="https://trello.com/b/Psqfqp7I/obsidian-roadmap">roadmap</a>, which the two-person team seem to be blistering through.</p>
<p>However the beauty of having plain text files is that I can do <em>whatever I want</em> with them. This is how I've set up my mobile note-taking.</p>
<h3>Syncthing</h3>
<p>To get the files onto my phone (and between my laptops), I use an open source app called <a href="https://syncthing.net/">Syncthing</a>. This works a bit like <code>rsync</code>, and does it's best to keep the files in sync across any connected devices. As most of my notes are small, self-contained files, conflicts tend to be quite rare.</p>
<h3>Termux</h3>
<p>While there are a handful of markdown editing apps available on Android, I prefer to stick with the soothing familiarity of VIM to do my editing. To achieve this, I use an <em>incredible</em> app called <a href="https://termux.com/">Termux</a>.</p>
<p>Termux is a terminal emulator with a large collection of Linux packages - which allows you to use things like git, node.js, ssh, and VIM all from the comfort of your tiny phone.</p>
<pre><code>termux-setup-storage
pkg update
pkg install vim
</code></pre>
<p>With these three commands, I was able to setup Termux to be able to see my synced vault folder, and edit with VIM.</p>
<p><small>(*<em>Okay I also installed git and cloned my dotfiles and installed all my regular VIM plugins. But you get the gist.</em>)</small></p>
<p>One slight annoyance is the the folder will be in different places on each device. To handle that, I have a <code>.extra</code> file to keep environment-specific config, to which which I've added:</p>
<p><code>export KB_DIRECTORY=/storage/shared/kb</code></p>
<h3>VIM</h3>
<p>While it was great to edit the files in VIM, without the graph view and backlink support it was a lot harder to navigate..</p>
<p>Fortunately, with a few additional lines to <code>.vimrc</code>, we can make this easier!</p>
<pre><code>autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *.md setlocal filetype=markdown
autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile $KB_DIRECTORY* setlocal path+=$KB_DIRECTORY/**
set suffixesadd+=.md
</code></pre>
<p>These three lines do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set the filetype to markdown for md files, which gives us some syntax highlighting</li>
<li>If I'm in any file in the knoweldge base, set my <code>path</code> to include all subdirectories of that folder. This means that when using <code>gf</code> to "go to file under cursor", or using <code>:find</code> to find a file, we can look at all then notes in any of my subdirectories.</li>
<li>Add <code>.md</code> to the list of "default" suffixes. When using <code>gf</code> to navigate to a file, VIM will try all theses suffixes as it looks for the file in the path.</li>
</ol>
<p>The combination of the above means that if I have a [[Backlink]] that points to <code>/SubFolder/Backlink.md</code>, I can put my cursor over the [[Backlink]], hit <code>gf</code> and VIM will be able to navigate to that file. Success!</p>
<h3>Termux API &amp; Widget</h3>
<p>So I now have the ability to edit my notes on my phone, but it's still a bit of a faff. Ideally on a mobile, I'd want to be able to quickly capture a note, and easily find a particular note to refer to.</p>
<p>The first thing I want is the ability to capture a note quickly. As the notes are plain text files, I can easily manipulate them with bash.</p>
<p>I have a bash function that will find or create the daily note file for today's date, and append whatever I type as a bullet to that file.</p>
<pre><code>today() {
	now=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d");
	if ([[ -z $1 ]]); then
		vim "$KB_DIRECTORY/Daily/$now.md"
	else
		echo $"- $@" &gt;&gt; "$KB_DIRECTORY/Daily/$now.md"

	fi
}
</code></pre>
<p>This allows me, wherever I am in the CLI, to type <code>today I did some stuff</code>, and it will add that to my note!</p>
<p>I have a similar (imperfect) function to be able to fuzzy find any note in my knowledge base:</p>
<pre><code>kb() {
	existing=$(find $KB_DIRECTORY -iname \*"$*"\*.md | head -n 1)
	if ([[ -n "$existing" ]]); then
		vim "$existing"
	else
		vim "$KB_DIRECTORY/$*.md"
	fi
}
</code></pre>
<p>This function allows me to type <code>kb obsidian</code> and it will find the first match it finds with obsidian in the name.</p>
<p>That's all well and good, but still involves opening up Termux and typing a bunch a stuff in. Termux has some additional packages that can be installed, which further integrate it with the Android OS.</p>
<p>In particular, I use Termux API, and Termux Widget.</p>
<p><code>pkg install termux-api</code></p>
<p>Termux allows you to create bash scripts in <code>~/.shortcuts/</code> (or <code>~/.shortcuts/tasks</code> for background tasks), which can then be accessed from a homescreen widget. And with Termux API, we can use some of the OS's input facilities. So, I can have a shortcut like the below:</p>
<pre><code>#!/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/bash
source ~/.functions
source ~/.extra

result=$(termux-dialog -t "Note" | jq -r '.text');

today "$result"
</code></pre>
<p>This script opens up a Dialog box which lets me type in a note, uses jq to parse the JSON result of that dialog and extract the text, and uses the <code>today</code> bash function from earlier to capture it in my daily note!</p>
<p>Even better, we can do the same thing with a voice note!</p>
<pre><code>result=$(termux-dialog speech -t "Note" | jq -r '.text');
</code></pre>
<h2>The Result</h2>
<p>Behold, in all it's nerdy goodness:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

        
        

        
<p>
A lot of tech discussion these days is focused around scaling web app infrastructures to handle huge traffic.
</p>
<p>
Hacker News abounds with posts about Kubernetes, distributed systems and database replication; the <a href="https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer" target="_blank">Large-Scale System Design Primer</a> on GitHub is extremely well-loved (113k stars) and chock full of advice on memcache clusters and DB sharding.
</p>
<p>
In all the heady excitement of getting your web-based notepad app ready to handle 10 billion daily users, it's important not to forget the power of modern computing hardware and how far simple optimizations can go.
</p>
<p>
You're probably not Facebook. Setting up FAANG-level infrastructure won't make your company into a FAANG, any more than a cargo cult can summon supply-bearing planes by building fake runways and wooden ATC towers. 
</p>
<p>
There's a place for big, scalable cluster infrastructures, but it's a larger scale than many organizations think.
</p>
<h3>The case for optimizing</h3>

<p>
It may sound obvious, but - optimizing your app to fulfill a request in 1/10 the time is like adding 9 servers to a cluster. Optimizing to 1/100 the time (reducing requests from say 1.5 sec to 15ms) is like adding 99 servers. 
</p>
<p>
That's a 1U server doing the work of <em>two 42U server racks</em>, formerly busy turning inefficient code into heat. 
</p>
<p>
That may be an extreme case - but unnecessary bloat is common, and these kinds of gains could be as simple as adding a well-chosen index to speed up a common query by 10x or 100x, or caching some seldom-changing response in memory rather than re-rendering it every time. 
</p>
<p>
Optimizing is good for the world, too:
</p>
<ul>
<li>1/10 or 1/100 the carbon footprint</li>
<li>Cleaner, more maintainable code and systems - optimizing often just means simplifying and removing unnecessary parts</li>
<li>Snappier experience for users (latency is generally lower if you can optimize enough to run on a single server rather than a bunch of networked ones)</li>
<li>Reduced hosting costs</li>
<li>Happier users - developers can focus more on solving users' problems and less on infrastructure</li>

</ul>
<p>
Of course there's a tradeoff between the cost of cloud infrastructure and the cost of paying developers to optimize; but paying developers to set up app clusters and database replication costs money too, and has fewer of the benefits and cost savings.
</p>
<h3>Modern computers are mind-numbingly fast</h3>

<p>
Writing the game engine in C++ for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1090060/Weapon_Hacker/" target="_blank">Weapon Hacker</a>, a side project of mine, taught me a lot about how powerful modern hardware really is. 
</p>
<p>
Coming from a C# / Python / Javascript / JIT-compiled world, my early experiments putting graphics on the screen in native C++ and DirectX were startling; the compiled executable was tiny, started up instantly, and could put hundreds of thousands of objects on the screen at 60 frames per second without breaking a sweat. 
</p>
<p>
A 60 FPS target gives games about 16ms to do all the work they need to in a frame. Weapon Hacker doesn't even compare to what modern AAA engines do, but it generates its random worlds in about 15ms (which last for about an hour-long playthru), and it handles frames with thousands of particles, physics objects, textures, font glyphs and graphical primitives, as well as sound mixing and music streaming, in about 5ms on a 2010-era CPU.
</p>
<p>
Compared to a game engine, the job of most web apps is incredibly mundane: take a request (some HTTP text) and return a response (some HTML or JSON or some such). And yet, 100ms or 500ms request processing times are common. Sometimes the info returned is expensive to generate, but it pays not to forget that in the end it's just inputting some bytes and outputting some bytes. 
</p>
<p>
Given the relative simplicity of the task, 16ms of processing per request (after subtracting network latency) should be achievable in most web applications.
</p>
<p>
On a cheap $5/month dual-core cloud VM, that would allow about 7,500 requests per minute. Or 7,500 pageviews, if you offload static stuff to a CDN. That means 10.8M per day, or 324M pageviews per month. 
</p>
<p>
Of course traffic wouldn't be evenly spread throughout the day, and cloud computing is generally priced for burst loads. But, let's be honest - your traffic isn't anywhere near 324M pageviews, right?
</p>
<p>
If not, condolences that Notepadly.io isn't a market behemoth yet - but congratulations, you can divert some time from multi-master replication and spot instance auto-scaling, and add a cool Clippy virtual assistant instead. Your users will thank you for it.
</p>
<h3>Optimization basics</h3>

<p>
Server-side optimization is a big topic, and there are likely people much better at it (and at explaining it) than I am, so here are just a few general pointers.
</p>
<p>
First - measure.
</p>
<p>
This can be as simple as putting timers around sections of code to see how many milliseconds they take to execute. Or, look at TTFB (time to first byte) in the Network tab of your browser's dev tools. 
</p>
<p>
2ms and 200ms requests seem similar to human perception, despite a massive 100x time difference, so it pays to have hard data.
</p>
<p>
Run simple stress tests to see how much traffic your app can handle. A simple one-page python script on a nearby VM or a dev machine can easily spin up a bunch of threads to make requests as fast as possible. Count the number of completed requests in, say, 30 seconds and watch your server's CPU, memory and IO usage to see where they max out.
</p>
<p>
Compare your stress test results to your day-to-day traffic, and aim for enough headroom that a normal day's traffic peaks at ~1% capacity (or whatever makes sense for your business).
</p>
<p>
Once you have some baseline measurements, here are a few common performance improvements:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Cache infrequently-changing responses in server memory</li>
<li>Optimize your database queries - add a well-chosen index, or delete an unneeded one (indices are separate internal tables, so you can sometimes save a lot of storage space and I/O time by removing one); tweak your WHERE conditions to narrow down the rows the DB has to scan through internally</li>
<li>Reduce the number of HTTP requests; don't let REST purists tell you you need a separate URL for each entity - if your app always needs customer &amp; order data at the same time, make it a single API call</li>
<li>Let clients cache static files indefinitely; use cache-breakers on the URLs for content changes</li>
<li>Offload static files to a CDN</li>
<li>Make sure your web server and database are set up and tuned right - that they have enough memory, threads, etc.</li>
<li>Consider a fast single-file database like <a href="https://sqlite.org/whentouse.html" target="_blank">SQLite</a>; it's not for every application, but I've found it handles individual queries about 5x faster than the big client-server DBMS's, with about 1/5 the storage space, and with much less administrative complexity. With its performance numbers it can actually power large sites. It also supports sharding scenarios (e.g. a database file per customer) which can get around the write-concurrency limitations for some applications.</li>
<li>Learn about code performance - in particular the dominance of memory latency as a slowdown factor, and the high price of I/O. Chandler Carruth has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHNmRkzxHWs" target="<em>blank">a great talk</a> on these from a C++ perspective. And Mike Acton's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc" target="</em>blank">talk on data-oriented design</a> is a classic.</li>

</ul>
<h3>You can upgrade your VM in a pinch</h3>

<p>
Cloud hosts usually let you upgrade to a higher-powered VM pretty easily in the event of some viral flood of traffic; in AWS, on my clients' projects, we have been able to launch more powerful EC2 instances (and vise-versa, consolidate to smaller, cheaper instances) by cloning to an AMI image, launching a new instance, and rerouting the same elastic IP, in about 5 minutes. If you freeze data changes, you can even stay online during the transition.
</p>
<p>
That could buy you time to think about clustering if you reach the scale where you need it.
</p>
<h3>In summary</h3>

<p>
There's a time and a scale for big distributed computing setups. But modern CPUs and cloud VMs are insanely fast, and the job of most web apps is incredibly mundane - you can get very far with some basic optimizations, and will likely do the world, your developers and your users some favors in the process.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>You know backups right? Those things you never got around to setting up… well no need to feel guilty any longer, today
I’m excited to share my new backup tool - <a href="https://bupstash.io/">Bupstash</a>!</p>
<p>So why is bupstash cool? Bupstash lets you make encrypted, deduplicated and secure backups.
Bupstash is fast, focused, and places strong emphasis on both security and privacy. Backups can happen to local drives or over ssh. Bupstash can backup files, directories, and even arbitrary command output.</p>
<p>Bupstash was designed to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Efficient deduplication - Bupstash can store hundreds of encrypted directory snapshots using a fraction of the space encrypted tarballs would require.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offline decryption keys - Backups do not require the decryption key be anywhere near an at-risk server or computer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Key/value tagging with search - all while keeping the tags fully encrypted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great performance on slow networks - Bupstash really strives to work well on high latency networks like cellular and connections to far-off lands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secure access controls - Ransomware and disgruntled business partners will be powerless to delete your backups, even after a
full system take over.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Efficient incremental backups - Bupstash knows what it backed up last time and skips that work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds great right? How does it work?</p>

<p>Bupstash stores data as a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle tree</a> with encrypted root nodes. Each
time a file is saved, it is split into data chunks, which are
encrypted (using crypto_box_curve25519xchacha20poly1305 from <a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium">libsodium</a>) and then sent to or saved in the backup repository if they have never been seen before.</p>
<p>To identify encrypted chunks for deduplication, we use an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC">HMAC</a> of the decrypted contents. The HMAC
key is a shared secret between the encryption key and the decryption key. This means
someone cannot guess a chunk’s contents based on the deduplication address in the backup
repository.</p>
<p>The end result is that many snapshots which share similar data also share encrypted chunks, resulting in very space-efficient backups. My personal backup repository
contains over 400 snapshots of my 40 GB home directory and weighs in at around 50 GB total.</p>

<p>In bupstash a key is either a ‘main key’ or a ‘put key’. Backups made by put keys can only be decrypted by the original
main key. With this setup, you can send backups to a bupstash repository without ever risking your decryption key.</p>
<p>You can imagine Bupstash’s model like when you send someone a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard">GPG</a>-encrypted email and you do not have access to their decryption key. Instead you use asymmetric cryptography and send data addressed
to their private key. Another benefit of the email-like model is that the email provider does not need access to your
decryption keys to store or forward your emails. Likewise, a remote bupstash repository never needs access
to your backup decryption keys to operate.</p>

<p>Bupstash maintains all backups in a mostly append-only log of encrypted backup metadata.
In order to allow searching that metadata, bupstash syncs the metadata log client-side before
performing decryption and searches client-side. This design sacrifices some performance for search and
listing in favour of fully encrypted metadata. In practice bupstash can easily search hundreds to thousands of snapshots
in seconds.</p>

<p>Bupstash focuses on backup and restore streaming, avoiding network round trips as much as possible.</p>
<p>When a user requests an encrypted snapshot, the
server walks the entire data structure server-side, and pushes
it to the client. The client then is able to verify the structure
and restore your data without any network round trips.</p>
<p>The bupstash <a href="https://bupstash.io/doc/man/bupstash-gc.html">‘garbage collector’</a> works
entirely server-side and without requiring the server to decrypt any data, avoiding
sending data to the client in costly and slow ways.</p>
<p>What does this all mean? In some benchmarks restoring backups from a distant
remote server, I was able to achieve 6x performance improvements over the
previous backup tool I was using (benchmarks coming soon).</p>

<p>Bupstash is designed to allow the use of ssh force commands to control whether
an ssh key has permission to make new backups, list backups or remove backups.</p>
<p>In my personal backup setup, my laptop can only add new backups via a vpn, but never remove
old backups from my backup repository. If my laptop were to be stolen, all backups are
safe from deletion.</p>
<p>When bupstash is configured with append-only access controls, making a backup is analagous to sending someone an email,
the recipient of the message is the one who decides when the message can be deleted.</p>
<p>You can see how to set this up in the <a href="https://bupstash.io/doc/guides/Remote%20Access%20Controls.html">access controls tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>Bupstash has the notion of a ‘send log’ for saving bandwidth and accelerating snapshot
speeds. Bupstash remembers which data chunks were
sent in the previous snapshot, allowing the client to avoid resending data pointlessly.</p>

<p>Below is a simple bupstash session:</p>
<pre><code>$ export BUPSTASH_REPOSITORY=ssh://bupstash.io/backups

$ bupstash put host="$(hostname)" name=home-backup.tar /home
ebb66f3baa5d432e9f9a28934888a23d

$ bupstash list host=$(hostname) and 'name=*.tar'
...
id="dbca49b072c0f94b9e72bf81e7716ff9" name="home-backup.tar" hostname="server1" timestamp="2020/08/03 15:47:32"

$ bupstash list-contents id="dbca*"
drwxr-xr-x 0     2020/10/30 13:32:04 .
-rw-r--r-- 1967  2020/10/30 13:32:04 data.txt
...

$ bupstash get id="dbca*" | tar -C ./restore -xvf -
...
$ bupstash get --pick data.txt id="dbca*"
data!

$ bupstash rm name=home-backup.tar and older-than 30d
$ bupstash gc

</code></pre><p>My goal with the bupstash user interface is letting people get on with their day
while having a simple and excellent backup insurance policy.</p>

<p>Bupstash is currently in alpha and ready for people to play with at their own
risk.</p>

<p>Wearing a plastic face shield and his orange monastic robes, Ashin Wirathu walked into a Yangon police station on November 2 after more than a year on the run. Until he went into hiding in June of last year, Wirathu, a nationalist preacher with links to the Tatmadaw — the Burmese military — was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/may/12/only-takes-one-terrorist-buddhist-monk-reviles-myanmar-muslims-rohingya-refugees-ashin-wirathu">one of Myanmar’s most prominent Islamophobes</a>, spreading bigotry and disinformation online. In May 2019, he was <a href="https://www.mmtimes.com/news/warrant-issued-arrest-ultranationalist-monk.html">charged with sedition</a>, but he <a href="https://myanmar-now.org/en/news/wirathu-declared-a-fugitive-after-failing-to-appear-at-court">never showed up</a> for his court date.</p>



<p>Wirathu’s surrender came in the final stages of an election campaign that once again exposed Myanmar’s racial and religious tensions, three years after a surge in hate speech and nationalist sentiment drove a campaign of ethnic cleansing targeting the country’s Muslim Rohingya minority.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The monk’s act was a piece of theater designed to put him and his anti-Muslim ideology back in the public eye and feed into the rumors and misinformation that was circulating online. Activists braced for a surge in hate speech on social media. It never came. The hard news of his arrest was covered by the mainstream press, but online, his supporters were strangely muted. Facebook pages sharing his views were flagged by civil society groups and quickly shut down by the platform.</p>



<p>“He didn’t get anything like the megaphone that he had hoped to get,” says Victoire Rio, a Yangon-based researcher and advisor to the Myanmar Tech Accountability Network, a consortium of nonprofit groups working on disinformation and hate speech. “The whole thing got fairly well contained, and that’s in big part because Facebook was able to take action.”</p>



	




<p>Facebook has faced years of criticism for its failings in Myanmar. In 2018, the <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya-facebook/u-n-investigators-cite-facebook-role-in-myanmar-crisis-idUKKCN1GO2PN">United Nations alleged the platform</a>&nbsp;allowed the proliferation of hate speech that incited the genocide. Campaigners in the U.S. and in Myanmar had been pressuring the company to prepare for the 2020 elections to prevent further violence.</p>



<p>In response, Facebook began trialing a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/08/preparing-for-myanmars-2020-election/">new, more active approach</a> to dealing with hate speech and political disinformation in the run up to the vote on November 8. It involved limiting users’ ability to reshare old pictures without context — a common misinformation tactic — and working with local partners to verify political parties’ pages and fact-check stories.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most significantly, the “community standards” Facebook uses to police content on its platforms were expanded. Usually, the company does not remove misinformation unless it creates a threat of imminent harm, but for a few months in Myanmar, that policy was broadened to include anything that could “suppress the vote or damage the integrity of the electoral process” — for example, a baseless rumor that the country’s de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, had died from Covid-19, which circulated before the election. Normally, the company’s community standards defines “hate speech” narrowly as attacks on people not concepts — Muslims, but not Islam. That was changed to prevent users from targeting the religion itself or attacking “invaders” or “illegals,” derogatory terms that refer to the Rohingya.</p>



	




<p>It is the first time the company has created country-specific community standards.</p>



<p>“That was a huge deal,” Rio says. “A lot of the problematic content is not framed as hate speech or as a call to violence in the way that Facebook likes it to be, like <em>Cluedo</em> — the weapon, the victim, the location, the whole thing.”</p>



<p>Myanmar has a well-documented problem with online hate speech and malicious falsehoods, which often attack the country’s Muslims. Nationalists and ultra-conservative Buddhists have successfully portrayed Muslims as a threat to the country’s culture and majority religion and as foreign interlopers. This hostility is so widespread that in the 2020 election, mainstream political parties competed to portray their opponents as more sympathetic to Islam.</p>



<p>One widely shared claim, originating from a candidate for the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party, was that <a href="https://www.myanmar-now.org/en/news/nld-to-report-usdp-candidate-for-making-false-claims-about-muslims-in-the-ruling-party?page=2">Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD) had 42 Muslim candidates</a>. The true number was two. An image circulated on social media showing an NLD meeting in which Buddhist monks appeared to be sitting on the floor while Muslim attendees sat on chairs, which, presented without context, looked like a calculated insult. Normally, such falsehoods would not have breached Facebook’s community standards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In October and November, disinformation that tried to exploit religious differences to distort the election result was taken down by Facebook, as were fake “leaked documents” feeding conspiracy theories linking Suu Kyi to the financier and human rights activist George Soros and unfounded claims by the opposition that the vote was rigged.</p>



<p>Several of Facebook’s “trusted partners,” civil society organizations that the company gives a kind of express lane for reporting violations of community standards, told <em>Rest of World</em> that in October and November, when they reported falsehoods and hate speech, their complaints were quickly escalated and the flagged content was removed. Previously, they found that their interventions carried little weight.</p>



<p>“To their credit, [Facebook has] thrown in much more effort, many more resources, for this election than we’ve seen them do … in the last few years,” says Jes Kaliebe Petersen, CEO of Phandeeyar, a social-technology accelerator in Yangon. “That’s been very positive. They’ve had boots on the ground; they’ve had people from their Singapore team dedicated to this. They’ve engaged with civil society.”</p>



<p>In October, Facebook <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-facebook-myanmar/facebook-shuts-dozens-of-myanmar-pages-over-inauthentic-behaviour-idUKKBN27M1BC">removed dozens of accounts</a> for “coordinated inauthentic behavior,” its term for spreading disinformation, and dismantled networks of fake users and clickbait pages that were pushing political misinformation. (Data for Facebook’s takedowns in November is not yet available.) Activists told <em>Rest of World</em> that the approach led to a significant reduction in disinformation and hate speech compared to the previous election five years ago.</p>



<p>“I’m not saying there is no hate speech in 2020, but I think it’s much less than in 2015,” says Harry Myo Lin, an interfaith activist. “They have a more active response to reports and hateful content. It’s not perfect, but I think they did better than before.”</p>



<p>A side effect of Facebook’s crackdowns on hate speech some actors migrated to other platforms, including the Russian social network VK and YouTube — exposing the latter’s own deficiencies in dealing with malicious content. “YouTube, now, is the most problematic one,” says Myat Thu, founder of the Yangon-based fact-checking site Think Before You Trust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Google-owned YouTube did not respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p>With the vote now over — the incumbent NLD won in a decisive victory — Facebook is set to return to its pre-election policies on December 6, leaving activists concerned that the platform will revert to being a place where hate and disinformation continues to circulate.</p>



<p>“The big question is: What happens next?” Petersen says. “Is this a sign of a new level of consistent support and focus from Facebook, or is it like a SWAT team that they put in, and now … the SWAT team is going to leave again, and we’re back to where we were before.”</p>



<p>In a statement, Facebook said it considers the experiment a success and could adapt it for other countries in the future.</p>



<p>At the Myanmar Tech Accountability Network, Rio said that while Facebook’s experimental approach still had profound flaws, it demonstrated that the company does have the tools to deal with the corrosive misinformation and bigotry that have proliferated on the platform worldwide.</p>



<p>“We need to give them credit where it’s due. They did pretty well,” Rio says. “But if anything, it shows that when they want to, they can.”</p>

<p><em><strong>A course for children in Grades 8-10.</strong></em></p>

<p>The information age is quickly turning into a misinformation age as we are increasingly being manipulated and lied to, by everyone. Our leaders, our media, the companies trying to sell us things, the companies wanting to collect our data, and even the companies claiming to expose the lies of other companies are manipulating us. In fact, even our friends and family inadvertently end up doing the same when they send us 'forwards' without critically analyzing them for accuracy.</p>
<p>One of the most important skills to learn is the ability to spot these lies and protect ourselves from being manipulated. This course will use practical examples and case-studies to analyze how and why the manipulation occurs, how and why most targets fall for these tricks, and how to spot, analyze and disarm them.</p>

<p>We will look at two broad problems: outright lies ("fake news") and technically true statements that are created to mislead. For lies, we will analyze how to spot lies, why even easy-to-disprove lies are widely believed, and how to prevent ourselves from falling for such lies. In case of misleading truths, we will see ways in which numbers and statistics can mislead (for example, use of absolute values instead of percentages or vice versa, or use of mean instead of Median or vice versa), ways in which text/stories/graphics can mislead (for example, in advertisements), and common sense ways in which to estimate the accuracy of the statements (for example, through basic web searches for information, looking for connections and relationships, making approximations and ballpark estimates).</p>

<p>After this course, students would be better equipped to defend themselves against the dark arts of social media manipulation.</p></div><div title="navin kabra photo.png" data-is-responsive="false" data-display-mode="fill" data-content-padding-horizontal="0" data-content-padding-vertical="0" data-exact-height="202" id="comp-kaphhov4"><a href="https://www.genwise.in/our-instructors/Navin-Kabra" target="_self" id="comp-kaphhov4link"><wix-image data-has-bg-scroll-effect="" data-image-info="{&quot;imageData&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Image&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;comp-kaphhov4_runtime_dataItem-kaphhp6n&quot;,&quot;metaData&quot;:{&quot;pageId&quot;:&quot;bcpzw&quot;,&quot;isPreset&quot;:false,&quot;schemaVersion&quot;:&quot;2.0&quot;,&quot;isHidden&quot;:false},&quot;title&quot;:&quot;navin kabra photo.png&quot;,&quot;uri&quot;:&quot;98f7cd_c1146be150aa40dc91e5feafc400ffb6~mv2.png&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:1123,&quot;height&quot;:1312,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Navin Kabra&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;navin kabra photo.png&quot;,&quot;crop&quot;:null,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;DynamicPageLink&quot;,&quot;innerRoute&quot;:&quot;Navin-Kabra&quot;,&quot;routerId&quot;:&quot;routers-k1j3n23p&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;comp-kaphhov4_runtime_dataItem-kaphhp6nlink&quot;},&quot;displayMode&quot;:&quot;fill&quot;},&quot;containerId&quot;:&quot;comp-kaphhov4&quot;,&quot;displayMode&quot;:&quot;fill&quot;}" data-has-ssr-src="true" data-is-svg="false" data-is-svg-mask="false" id="comp-kaphhov4img"><img id="comp-kaphhov4imgimage" alt="Navin Kabra" data-type="image" itemprop="image" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/98f7cd_c1146be150aa40dc91e5feafc400ffb6~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_168,h_196,al_c,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_3/navin%20kabra%20photo.png"></wix-image></a></div><p><span><span><span>Navin Kabra is CTO and Co-Founder at ReliScore, a company that provides skill and capability assessment solutions to the software industry.

<p>By Patrick Colbeck</p>



<p>I’m not sure how you have spent your day today, but I spent mine reviewing contracts and system overview documents related to voting systems.  Why is that?  You may have heard about the <a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/software-glitch-caused-6-000-republican-votes-to-swing-democrat-in-michigan-county">6,000 votes in Antrim County</a>, Michigan that were flipped via software from Donald Trump to Joe Biden. No one denies the veracity of this claim.  The only differences between various parties involved revolve around explanations for exactly how that happened.  </p>



<p>The media has already projected that Michigan’s 16 Electoral College votes will go to Joe Biden.  This projection is based upon an assertion that Joe Biden leads Donald Trump by 146,123 votes.  Any attempt to assert that Michigan is “in play” would have to account for that large of a deficit.  As it turns out, we can.  Against the backdrop of the 6,000 vote “flip” in Antrim County, we have also identified evidence of algorithmic data manipulation in three other counties that could account for as many as 140,000 votes being switched from Donald Trump to Joe Biden in Michigan…and that is through examination of only 3 out of the 83 counties in Michigan.  In the wake of election fraud allegations, <a href="https://www.mlive.com/politics/2020/11/federal-lawsuit-seeks-to-throw-out-12m-votes-flipping-michigan-for-trump.html?fbclid=IwAR2H1saVwouRyRpAnhkWghxhOPhfODvEjDJA8uz9fLVe4OGl9Sdlt1JsES0">a Federal Lawsuit has been filed that addresses 1.2 Million ballots cast in Michigan</a>.  The bottom line is that the election fraud observed to date can indeed impact the election results in Michigan and potentially the nation as a whole.</p>



<p>Key findings:</p>



<div><div>
<ul><li>Dominion Voting Systems are designed to connect to the internet including wireless internet connections which could be accessed outside of a vote counting facility. Introduces significant chain of custody concerns regarding vote tallies.</li><li>My personal attempts to discern the chain of custody regarding how vote tallies were to be transferred from the counting board tabulation machines to the county were met with deflection and avoidance by one of the Senior election officials, Chris Thomas.</li><li>According to Dominion, there are two methods available to users of the Dominion Voting system to transfer vote tally data to election officials: 1) physical transfer via flash drive or 2) over a network connection.  </li><li>The inability to verify which method is used obstructs the statutory duties of a poll challenger and puts election integrity at risk.</li><li>According to the Detroit Elections Manual, flash drives were to be used to transfer the data, but it was obvious from review of the network configuration that network connections were in use including Wi-Fi connections.  </li><li>If memory cards were indeed intended to be used, it would have raised additional chain of custody concerns regarding these cards.  In Philadelphia, <a href="https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2020/09/30/laptop-encrypted-usb-drives-stolen-from-philadelphia-election-machine-warehouse-officials/">an election laptop and encrypted flash drives were stolen from an election machine warehouse in September</a>.</li><li>A forensic audit of the voting system configuration in Antrim County revealed that an open port had been accessed in the Dominion voting machines putting chain of custody at risk.</li><li>If a computer is connected to the internet, all resources on that computer, including voting data, is vulnerable to remote manipulation.  See my <a href="https://letsfixstuff.org/2020/08/lets-fix-election-integrity-ev/">Election Integrity Solution Podcast</a> for more information on this risk.</li></ul>

<p>Why is internet connectivity a big deal?  It enables top-down manipulation of vote tallies.  </p>



<p>Some of you may have seen examples of “vote flipping” on live news network feeds in which thousands of votes were added to Joe Biden while the exact number of votes were subtracted from Donald Trump.  </p>



<p><a href="https://rumble.com/vb236n-proof-why-trump-will-win-part-2.html">SEE VIDEO PROOF OF VOTE FLIPPING</a></p>



<p>Remember, these “flips” have already been confirmed to have happened in Antrim County.  </p>



<p>At the end of the night, though, any electronic vote switching must be reconciled with other ballot records such as the poll books and physical ballot counts.  All precincts must be balanced to ensure the integrity of that precincts vote tally.</p>



<p>Many of you may recall news stories of a cessation of voting activities across many of the major cities in battleground states between Midnight and 4:00am on November 4.  <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/nov/04/facebook-posts/battleground-states-did-not-stop-counting-votes-el/">According to Politifacts this assertion is FALSE</a>.  </p>



<blockquote><p>“At no point has the counting process stopped since it began at 7 a.m. yesterday morning, which was when, per Michigan election law, it could begin,” said Tracy Wimmer, director of media relations for Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, referring to the morning of Nov. 3.</p><cite>SOURCE:  <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/nov/04/facebook-posts/battleground-states-did-not-stop-counting-votes-el/">Politifact</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>I was on the floor of the AV Counting Board in Detroit between midnight and 4:00am.  Counting activity had indeed stopped during that time period.  In fact, the only apparent ballots available to count at that time were around 12 boxes of military ballots.  Rather than count these ballots during overnight quiet period, Detroit Election Officials chose to wait until they had prohibited access to the AV Counting Board by Poll Challengers such as myself.  I had left to train our next wave of poll challengers in a break room upstairs only to find that my re-entry to the counting board was prohibited. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.150/bkq.639.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/More-Cardboard-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.150/bkq.639.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/More-Cardboard-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.150/bkq.639.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/More-Cardboard-300x169.jpg 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.150/bkq.639.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/More-Cardboard-768x432.jpg 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.150/bkq.639.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/More-Cardboard-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.150/bkq.639.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/More-Cardboard-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>SOURCE:  Cardboard on Windows at Detroit AV Counting Board by Patrick Colbeck</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>So, why would the ballot count be stopped if there were ballots remaining to be counted?  The end of shift for the poll workers on duty was 5:00am.  Well, one could make the claim that they were waiting for word on the number of votes they needed to win the state.  Perhaps coincidentally, a Detroit Elections Bureau vehicle arrived at the back entrance of the AV Counting Board with 61 mail bins full of ballots at 3:45 am.  I witnessed ballot after ballot being placed upon staging tables after a very quiet night.  Could it be that this was an attempt to ensure that the paper trail matched with the electronic vote tally?</p>



<p>Is it even possible to modify the electronic vote tally?  According to <a href="https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/11/dominion-voting-systems-officer-strategy-security-eric-coomer-admitted-2016-vendors-election-officials-access-manipulate-vote/">Dominion Voting Systems Officer of Strategy and Security, the answer is yes.</a></p>



<blockquote><p><strong>Dr. Coomer’s statement brings to light a very serious issue all voters should understand.</strong>&nbsp;Voting systems must be re-certified each time they make changes to the hardware or software. Recertification is an expensive and time consuming process.&nbsp;<strong>What Dr. Coomer told the Board is that Dominion Voting does not go back for recertification of software when threats to their code are discovered.&nbsp;</strong>Rather, they rely on post-election audits and providing advice to election jurisdictions about security. I have reviewed all of the recertification documents produced by Dominion, and I do not recall any software adjustments for security purposes.</p><p><strong>This is the reality of the security of your vote.</strong>&nbsp;Software systems that count and record the vote across Illinois and throughout the USA are not updated to address security problems, and even if they were, the software can be completely bypassed by going to the data tables that drive the systems.</p><cite>SOURCE:  <a href="https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/11/dominion-voting-systems-officer-strategy-security-eric-coomer-admitted-2016-vendors-election-officials-access-manipulate-vote/">The Gateway Pundit</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>So, if vote tallies were electronically manipulated, what records need to be preserved to verify that it happened?  In order to answer that question, let’s take a closer look at the design of the Dominion Voting System.</p>

<p>Upon review of the design of the Dominion Voting System, what components merit further examination?</p>



<p>While ALL equipment and records need to be secured as soon as possible, I believe the security of our election boils down to the secure retention and examination of the following key artifacts:</p>



<ul><li>ImageCast Listener Module: “The ImageCast Listener module is responsible for receiving and tracking encrypted results file transmissions from any ImageCast Election Day tabulator.”</li><li>Image Cast Evolution Memory Card: “The ICE memory card has only one partition that holds the ballot images, election database, audio files, etc” (<em>Very curious as to what “etc” might entail</em>)</li><li>EMS Audit Log:  “From the initial state of the election project, until the deactivation state, the EMS system maintains an activity log within the EMS Database. This activity log contains every action that any of the users have performed within the system and represents a detailed audit log that can be analyzed and printed in the form of an audit report. The audit record information cannot be modified or permanently deleted using the EMS client applications. It can, however, be exported for archiving purposes as part of the record retention policy. Keeping in mind that audit log information can contain a significant amount of information, it is the responsibility of the administrative user to perform regular archiving of the log.  During the voting phase of the election event, ImageCast devices also keep an activity audit log which tracks events happening on the device itself.”</li><li>Event logs from the Election Official, Electronic Poll Book, Tabulator and Adjudicator computers</li></ul>



<p>There are <a href="https://letsfixstuff.org/2020/11/michigan-election-fraud-is-real-and-significant/">numerous lawsuits</a> in progress through the state and federal court systems which allege election fraud.  It will take time to gather and evaluate all of the artifacts cited above.  The Dominion Voting System is complex.  This complexity is compounded by vote tally chain of custody concerns enabled by the connection of this system to the internet.  It will take weeks, even months potentially, to reveal the truth of what caused software “glitches” such as the Antrim County vote flip and other “flips” observed throughout the early morning hours of November 4th.</p>



<p><em>NOTE:  <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title52-section20701&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim">52 USC Section 20701</a> requires that election records are retained for 22 months from the date of the election.  Furthermore, willful destruction of these records would likely be seen by courts as justification for issuing orders to redo the election.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I consider PR reviews as one of the fundamental and most important
tools developers have to collaborate. We use it daily to submit changes and
to get important feedback from peers and more experienced developers.</p>
<p>And so, <strong>it should be targeted to software developers and not to managers</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s cover some of the daily tortures of dealing with <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a>, which
I unfortunately need to deal with.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey friend, how about you implement this piece of functionality in this other way?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This common and healthy workflow is <strong>fundamentally broken</strong> in BB because
you cannot copy code from the body of the PR into a comment without getting
a lot more than what you clearly selected.</p>
<p><img src="https://nosleepjavascript.com/460408cff29803e91776376bae5605ad/copypastev3.gif" alt="Copying and pasting code from PR changes is broken"></p>

<p>Trying to click anywhere else when writing a comment like for example
expanding to see more code will result in an alert that states
that your comment changes will be removed which is already super annoying.
But if you even do not care about discarding your comment and you go ahead
and click on discard the comment isn’t really discarded! So it is completely misleading.</p>
<p>This is BB not caring about the amount of time developers throw into detailed
code reviews.</p>
<p><img src="https://nosleepjavascript.com/7a16dbe4130224ea56472f85903a24f7/commentclick.gif" alt="Are you sure you want to discard (actually not) your comments?"></p>
<h2 id="what-you-see-may-be-what-you-get-horrible-markdown-support"><a href="#what-you-see-may-be-what-you-get-horrible-markdown-support" aria-label="what you see may be what you get horrible markdown support permalink"></a>What You See May Be What You Get: horrible markdown support</h2>
<p>Markdown is a tool aimed for technical folks, it is minimal but gets
the job done without any distractions, it is <em>not</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> (what you see is what you get)
by design and partially for simplicity.</p>
<p>BB takes the worse of all worlds: horrible “standard” markdown support
that varies across places and combine it with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> editor.
This creates really weird
use cases we will cover below.</p>
<p>Other technical tools, such as <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>, understand how important decent markdown
support is and they use it to empower developers.
They do build visual tools on top of markdown but without combining them
into a monster broken implementation.</p>
<p>Let’s see some specially frustrating cases</p>
<h3 id="selecting-a-code-block-language"><a href="#selecting-a-code-block-language" aria-label="selecting a code block language permalink"></a>Selecting a code block language</h3>
<p>Instead of using the standard <strong>”```typescript”</strong> they include a visual
Select. Guess what, professional developers don’t need this help at all, and
newbies can search the web once and forget about this.</p>
<p>Think about ergonomics, with regular markdown you do everything with the keyboard,
with the BB inferno you first need to type the three backward ticks and then grab the
mouse and select your language and then click back on the code block.</p>
<p>This is a really poor understanding of your user’s UX!</p>
<p><img src="https://nosleepjavascript.com/e7b45f374d83485074abc0f93fc73afb/mdlang.gif" alt="selecting code block language"></p>
<h3 id="smart-dumb-markdown-hybrid-support"><a href="#smart-dumb-markdown-hybrid-support" aria-label="smart dumb markdown hybrid support permalink"></a>Smart (dumb) markdown hybrid support</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">markdown</a> hybrid implementation produces stuff like this</p>
<p><img src="https://nosleepjavascript.com/e0371b316a1ee15020dc166396db9c4c/format.gif" alt="format"></p>
<h3 id="list-items-without-an-empty-line"><a href="#list-items-without-an-empty-line" aria-label="list items without an empty line permalink"></a>List items without an empty line</h3>
<p>This cannot happen in the comment textbox unless you force it to, but
it can happen in the PR description textbox and it can also happen when you
write the markdown in a <em>regular</em> text editor / IDE i.e. when committing code
via git, when writing the README, etc.</p>
<p>If you don’t leave an empty line before a list then it won’t get transformed correctly:</p>
<p><img src="https://nosleepjavascript.com/c8e58d30c452b643bf40ea77f00b21d0/lists.gif" alt="markdown lists"></p>
<h2 id="performance-of-the-text-box"><a href="#performance-of-the-text-box" aria-label="performance of the text box permalink"></a>Performance of the text box</h2>
<p>I have a pretty good and modern computer but most of the time
I experience heavy lags when writing a simple text only comment in <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BB</a>.</p>
<p>I suspect this is related to the horrible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> implementation,
which we have just heavily broken down above.</p>
<h2 id="doesnt-work-on-large-prs"><a href="#doesnt-work-on-large-prs" aria-label="doesnt work on large prs permalink"></a>Doesn’t work on large PRs</h2>
<p>When a PR is a large (I know, I know, large PRs should not happen, but unfortunately sometimes they do)
BB will choose either</p>
<ol>
<li>consuming a lot of resources</li>
<li>not displaying the entire PR</li>
</ol>
<p>In either case the UX ends up being bad.</p>
<p>In case <strong>1.</strong> you will get a lot of RAM being consumed and
most likely the scrolling and the interaction with the page
will be even more slow and awkward.</p>
<p>In case <strong>2.</strong> you need to click file by file to inspect a PR, which isn’t better IMO.</p>
<h2 id="bitbucket-is-jira-applied-to-git"><a href="#bitbucket-is-jira-applied-to-git" aria-label="bitbucket is jira applied to git permalink"></a>Bitbucket is Jira applied to git</h2>
<p>I’ve seen that the described behaviors tend to be cross
cutting problems across the <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/">Atlassian</a> suite, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira</a> has similar
problems and <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/alldoc/atlassian-documentation-32243719.html">Confluence</a> is horrible, they are generally
really slow and clunky and unresponsive and text editing tends to be a pain.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-your-product"><a href="#understanding-your-product" aria-label="understanding your product permalink"></a>Understanding your product</h2>
<p>PRs are one of the core use cases of <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BB</a> as a product,
they are what have arguably made <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> the beacon that it is now.</p>
<p>There are a few things your PR experience needs to provide at the base level</p>
<ul>
<li>PR title, description and inline comments.</li>
<li>Every text box needs to support plain markdown and maybe mentioning other people (tagging).</li>
<li>If you want to add markdown shortcuts make them <em>insert markdown</em> and <strong>not</strong> actually applying style.</li>
<li>Good diffing visualization (which BB does well IMO).</li>
<li>It is all about the code!</li>
<li>Copying code from the diff needs to work as expected.</li>
<li>Markdown code blocks (code snippets) are a fundamental feature of all your text boxes.</li>
<li>Either provide a really good experience inside your code blocks or do nothing.</li>
<li>Your app needs to be simple, small, fast and stable in time.</li>
<li>Some PRs are open for long periods of time, make sure your app is stable!.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are one the core features a good PR UI needs to provide, if anything,
these need to be the best of the best.</p>
<p>BB seems to have prioritized being “cute” or “pretty” (is it?) instead of being functional.</p>
<h2 id="solutions"><a href="#solutions" aria-label="solutions permalink"></a>Solutions</h2>
<p><a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a> is a developer centric platform, use developer centric tools,
use plain old text inputs with good markdown support, add as little as possible
on top of that, make the experience of writing comments, PR descriptions,
code snippets as easy, simple and fast as possible.</p>
<p>Don’t leak stuff from <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira</a> and <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/alldoc/atlassian-documentation-32243719.html">Confluence</a> to <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a>, they have different
audience.</p>
<p>And if you have time… make sure <em>every</em> text input in your system has a plain text
mode, where either you interpret it as good old markdown or as unformatted text, either
is much better than what you have now.</p>

<p><span>How do they get all their data into one place in order to merge it all together?</span></p>
<p><span>Traditionally you would need to have a large team of data engineers to connect to all these various data sources, set up complex ETL jobs using either custom scripts or python libraries like Airflow and Luigi and then they would have to ensure that those pipelines were constantly running.</span></p>
<p><span>This method is both time consuming and expensive.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thankfully, there are modern tools that can help your team simplify your data workflow and instead of 4, 5 maybe 10 data engineers. You can go down to just one.</span></p>
<p><span>One of those tools is Fivetran.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://fivetran.com/"><span>Fivetran</span></a><span> is a highly comprehensive ELT tool that is becoming more popular every day.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You’re probably wondering, what is an ELT?</span></p>
<p><span>ELT stands for extract, load, transform.</span></p>
<p><span>These are the steps required to take your data from a system like Saleforce or Quickbooks and insert it into your centralized data storage system (often referred to as a data warehouse).</span></p>
<p><span>Basically, Fivetran allows for efficient collection of business processes and customer data from related applications, websites, and servers. The data collected is then transferred to other tools for analytics, marketing, and data warehousing purposes.</span></p>
<h2><span>Fivetran Data Connectors&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>Fivetran does all this by offering a myriad of connectors to both source and destination connectors that allows for both pushing and pulling of data. The pull connectors will pull from data sources in a variety of methods including ODBC, JDBC, and multiple API methods. That’s a lot of technical abbreviations that translate to Fivetran being able to connect to nearly a hundred different data sources.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>What Are Pushing And Pulling Data Connectors</span></h3>
<p><span>Fivetran’s push connectors receive data that a source sends, or pushes, to them. In push connectors, such as </span><a href="https://fivetran.com/docs/events/webhooks#webhooks"><span>Webhooks</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://fivetran.com/docs/events/snowplow#snowplow"><span>Snowplow</span></a><span>, source systems send data to Fivetran as events. This is very useful to make sure your data is as real-time as possible. From there, you can start implementing logic, and dashboards. This is where</span><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://fivetran.com/docs/transformations/basic-sql"><span>Fivetran data transformations come into play</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>How Does Fivetran Transformations Work</span></h3>
<p><span>This tool isn’t limited to only extracting and loading data.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After loading the data, Fivetran offers data teams the ability to easily set up custom data transformations.&nbsp; These</span> <span>transformations can run in your destination after you load your data in, so your raw data is always available alongside your transformed data. If a transformation fails, you can look into the logs to try to figure out the issue. If your analytical needs change, you can edit your transformations and run them again on your raw data.</span></p>
<p><span>There are two types of transformations you can use. Custom SQL and dbt transformations. Both can be set to run when you need and can help shape your data as need be.</span></p>
<p><span>What’s also great is if your team uses dbt transformations they can be version controlled to ensure your team can roll back to a previous data transformation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For those unfamilar with dbt.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>dbt is an open-source software that enables you to perform sophisticated data transformations in your destination using simple SQL statements. With dbt, you can, write and test SQL transformations, create and share documentation about your dbt transformations and view data lineage graphs.</span></p>
<p><span>Some other high level differences are listed below.</span></p>

<p><span>Once you have created your transformations. You will need to schedule them to run.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>How Does Fivetran Manage Data Scheduling&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span>One of the hacky things data engineers do to manage scheduling is put everything into cron or Windows Task Scheduler. Both of these tools allow you to schedule jobs at specific times and intervals.</span></p>
<p><span><br>
</span><span>The problem is, this can quickly become very messy.</span></p>
<p><span>Fivetran makes it easy. You can set your transformations to run either at specific intervals through the user interface or set it to run when new data is added to your source.</span></p>
<p><span>It’s also important to note that depending on how you set up your sources as well as which sources you are using can change how your data is updated.</span></p>
<p><span>Fivetran refers to the initial data load essentially as a sync. After the initial sync of your historical data, Fivetran moves to performing incremental updates of any new or modified data from your source database. During incremental syncs, Fivetran uses your database’s native change capture mechanism to request only the data that has changed since our last sync, including deletes. Each database uses a different change capture mechanism.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can also set up re-syncs that will essentially wipe out all the previous data in the past.</span></p>
<p><span>The point here is that most of this data loading, is done without setting up complex API connections.</span></p>
<h3><span>Should I hire a BI Developer/Data Engineer For Fivetran</span></h3>
<p><span>Tools like Fivetran make developing ELTs very easy. The scheduling, connectors and transformations remove a lot of the heavy infrastructure lift that requires data and software engineers.</span></p>
<p><span>However, this doesn’t mean you don’t need a data expert.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Between needing to build dashboards off the data as well as creating SQL queries that are reliable and robust, having a strong data expert is important.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Our team can help you implement your Fivetran transformations as well as develop dashboards and metrics. <a href="https://www.theseattledataguy.com/contact-data/">Reach out to us today for a free consultation.</a></span></p>

		<p>Would you believe that chasing the high score was not always a part of arcade games? Indeed, until well after Pong it was not even a desired feature until 1978’s <em>Star Fire</em> took it to a whole new level. The tale of that game and its many innovations are what we will bring you today, as well as the source code which reveals even more secrets within the legendary game <em>Star Fire</em>.</p>

<p><em>Star Fire</em>, as with all good ideas, came from a place of ambition. The man with the plan was a fellow named Ted Michon. Michon had worked as a technician at arcade company Digital Games/Micronetics, which set him up to become a game creator for them when he created an early microprocessor game for them called <em>Night Racer</em>. With a new direction for games taking shape and the company he worked for falling apart, Michon decided to form his own independent arcade development company called Techni-Cal in 1976.</p>
<p>Ted was an alumnus of California Technical Institute (CalTech) and knew some of the computer-saavy students behind him in seniority. From this pool he settled on the inventive David Rolfe, who was a hotshot assembly programmer at the school. Rolfe readily admits that he has no interest in games as a matter of enjoyment, but leaps at the chance to solve hard problems. The task Michon had ready for his new employee would scratch that itch.</p>

<p>Ted had become enamored with an obscure film called <em>Star Wars</em>, particularly the iconic spaceship battles. He wanted to create a game which had that same sense of high-flying freedom, as well as incorporating a color monitor (for which had had found a cheap supplier). These sorts of tasks in the late 1970s, preceding even Space Invaders, were tall orders. Michon had created a hardware to facilitate this feat though, so it was up to Rolfe to make it sing.</p>
<p>Coupled with Ted’s then girlfriend (later wife) Susan Owen helping with art, the three person team would work out of Michon’s apartment via a terminal connected to the mainframe at CalTech to embark on their <em>Star Wars</em>-inspired project. At one point they even had hope they could secure the <em>Star Wars</em> license, though no official Star Wars game would emerge until 1982. They would retain major inspirations from that initial concept though, like the title screen at the enemy spacecraft. Michon secured a tentative deal with arcade manufacturer Midway Manufacturing, subsidiary of Bally, and the team would begin to show them work in progress.</p>
<figure id="attachment_10609" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10609"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/02-Rolfe.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="285" srcset="https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/02-Rolfe.jpg 571w, https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/02-Rolfe-274x300.jpg 274w" sizes="(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10609">David Rolfe</figcaption></figure>
<p>Rolfe’s first problem to solve was creating an efficient color system which would not consume all the expensive RAM at their disposal. A standard, modern color system would assign a bit for every two colors on the screen, but even a four color system at even standard resolution would be over 32K of RAM. Rolfe’s solution would allow for up to eight total colors which only used 1.8 bits per pixel, with some compromises. For instance the stars in the background could change color from white to blue if one of the Tie Fighter-based enemy ships passed in front of it. Likely this was a form of color-cels as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfh0ytz8S0k">used on the Commodore 64</a>, spread across much larger objects.</p>
<p>Then to make the ships appear as if they existed in a 3D space, Rolfe would have to implement a new technique called spite-scaling. <a href="https://youtu.be/k0uFSSzYaJ8?t=174">Taito’s <em>Interceptor</em></a> had deployed this technique, but that game was only available in Japan. By having Susan create several different images of the enemy spacecraft, Rolfe could switch between the different sizes on the fly to have the fighters swoop in. All of this required a lot of storage, so much so that <em>Star Fire</em> wound up using 21 separate ROM chips to store all the game graphics and code.</p>
<p>Even with the unprecedented excitement and novelty the game could show, Midway was not impressed by the gameplay of <em>Star Fire</em>. It was suggested that they add in an extra element for the player to shoot, and perplexingly Midway President Hank Ross said that this should be a witch on a bicycle, not a spaceship. Even with this additional, the game still wasn’t deemed up to their standards, so Ted and David were both released from their deal.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mattel Electronics Intellivision programmer interviews" width="747" height="560" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UDZq4OLg7wQ?start=37&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With no money coming in, Rolfe had to find some extra work in the meantime. He joined up with APh Technology Consulting, who was at the time working on the programming backbone for what would become the Mattel Intellivision. Rolfe was directly responsible for providing a working prototype for the 1978 Winter CES, after which time Michon had managed to find a new buyer for their space flight game.</p>
<p>Exidy, a smaller arcade company out of Sunnyvale, California, was responsible for minor hits like <em>Death Race</em> and <em>Circus</em>. They were always seeking to push technological boundaries and thought <em>Star Fire</em> could be the sort of stand-out they needed. Rolfe returned to the project to make some minor changes – such as adding Exidy branding, including to an Enterprise-esque spaceship which replaced the witch – and the game was placed into a sit-down cabinet for increased immersion. It felt as close as they could get to the Star Wars game without a license.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/03-Star-Fire-Flyer-01.jpg" alt="" width="507" height="652" srcset="https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/03-Star-Fire-Flyer-01.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/03-Star-Fire-Flyer-01-233x300.jpg 233w, https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/03-Star-Fire-Flyer-01-795x1024.jpg 795w, https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/03-Star-Fire-Flyer-01-768x989.jpg 768w, https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/03-Star-Fire-Flyer-01-1193x1536.jpg 1193w" sizes="(max-width: 507px) 100vw, 507px"></p>
<p>After release in November of 1978, Exidy did not find the mega-hit that they were looking for, but they did bring one significant innovation: The high score table. Rolfe had wanted to have players make a mark on the game as a signature of their accomplishments, and he felt that saving scores would be the best way to do that. Such a trick had never been done before. Some arcade owners might take down high scores by hand as part of a formal competition, but <em>Star Fire</em> put these competitive instincts into rigid code. Players would have a reason to return to a machine beyond the novelty, and that goalpost could change constantly, along with the ability to input their initials.</p>
<p>Following this, Rolfe would again work with Michon on the games Fire One and Kreepy Krawlers (unreleased) for Exidy before moving over to full-time on Intellivision work. Before that though, he had prepared a second version of Star Fire for export called ‘Star Fire II’ with fixes from its predecessor. Through the last 40 years, Rolfe has managed to maintain this source code for this game and has provided the opportunity for Gaming Alexandria to share its secrets!</p>
<p>The following observations were made by Ryou of <a href="http://sudden-desu.net/">Sudden Desu</a>, who delved into the Star Fire II code and extracted some interesting findings which support Rolfe’s tale.</p>
<hr>
<h2>STAR WARS</h2>
<p>The visual references are numerous and hard to ignore, from the STAR FIRE logo to the TIE fighter enemies, and even the Exidy ship which has the iconic X Wing laser guns. The David Rolfe interview elaborates on the reasoning behind this. The code is even more explicit in its references. SWARX.ASM is the code to draw the STAR FIRE logo on the title screen, and its TITLE directive is telling:</p>
<pre>TITLE "DO STAR WARS TITLE"</pre>
<p>When this code is called from ATRACT.ASM, it’s referred to as “SPACE WARS”</p>
<pre>CALL DOSWAR ;WRITE SPACE WARS SIGN</pre>
<p>The TIE fighter enemies are referred to by that name as well. TIE.ASM is their primary code.</p>
<pre>SEXTERN PS.TFIR,PS.PULS ;TIE FIGHTER FIRE IN INIT


;MUST BE CALLED BEFORE THE TIE FIGHTERS CYCLE THROUGH THE PSEUDO COLOR RAM
;THIS ROUTINE IS OPTIMIZED FOR SPEED BASE ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT
; MOST OF THE SCREEN IF FILLED WITH ZERO

</pre>
<h2>EASTER EGG</h2>
<p>Star Fire is known as being the first game which allowed for player initials to be saved alongside their score in the High Score list. This also means that Star Fire is the first game that has Easter Eggs based on player initials. The high score list code is located in ATRACT.ASM, and right at the top of the file we have this assembler expression:</p>
<pre>FT.GOD = -1 ;SET IF MACHINE KNOWS US</pre>
<p>And further down, among the code for the player initials input:</p>
<pre>IFE FT.GOD

<p>Indeed, if you enter DBR, TZM or SKM as your initials, you will then see a full screen message reading HI DAVE, HI TED or HI SUSAN, respectively.</p>
<p>You may notice that the labels for Susan’s block of code are TRYSKO and GOTSKO, which implies the initials for the easter egg changed from SKO to SKM. (Did Susan get married along the way…?) Indeed, SKM only works for Star Fire II. In the original Star Fire sets, the initials for Susan’s easter …</p></div></div>

For free you get services that complement each other with ergonomic and easy to bootstrap libraries. With Firestore libs you get all the goodies of Firebase suite - auth, serverless, storage, ML and others perfectly blended with the language specifics.<br></p><p><img src="https://prismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com/leancodelanding2/dc9745e6-6cc3-45d1-bbb9-c661003ebaf7_Group+1529.png"></p><p>The only bad thing about it is that they are pervasive - once you get them, you start using them everywhere. In all layers. Generally, that is a bad thing, but letâ€™s be honest here, most small apps donâ€™t need any additional abstractions and using the libraries directly is a good thing.</p></div></div></div></section><section><div><div><div><div><p><img alt="" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMjY4IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjM4IiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMjY4IDM4IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjxwYXRoIGQ9Ik0yNDguOTY5IDM4VjBNMjY4IDE4Ljk4NWgtMzguMDMyTTEzMy45ODUgMzhWMG0xOS4wMzEgMTguOTg1aC0zOC4wMzJNMTkuMDMxIDM4VjBtMTkuMDAxIDE4Ljk4NUgwIiBzdHJva2U9IiMwMDAiIHN0cm9rZS1taXRlcmxpbWl0PSIxMCIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="></p></div></div><div><h2><strong>Offline capabilities</strong></h2><p><img src="https://prismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com/leancodelanding2/62110205-82f5-4a52-bef3-2a190f906b77_Mask+Group+%285%29.png"></p><p>This is a major trait of Firestore. The truly killer feature - <strong>it can work </strong>(to some extent) <strong>offline.</strong> <em>Seamlessly</em>. If you have accessed the data previously, you can do so again without the Internet connection. You can even save the data there without active connection. Firestore libraries handle all the syncing, data merging, notifications and other problems.<br></p><h2><strong>You donâ€™t need backendâ€¦ sometimes<br></strong></h2><p><strong>Firebase platform (that Firestore is part of) might be a viable â€œbackendâ€� option for small, user-focused apps.</strong> If you use it alongside other SaaS solutions (e-mails, voice calls, etc.), you might be even able to build a not-so-small app without creating any traditional backend system.<br></p><p><img src="https://prismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com/leancodelanding2/0b913bc2-d221-491b-9f35-c4503a14c2bc_qwerty.png"></p><h4><strong><br>Firebase suite provides you with:</strong></h4><ol><li>Auth - Firebase Auth.</li><li>Storage - Firebase Cloud Storage.</li><li>Serverless - Firebase Cloud Functions.</li><li>Basic machine learning - Firebase ML.</li><li>A/B tests &amp; user-scoped configuration - Firebase Remote Configuration.</li><li>App distribution &amp; monitoring - Firebase App Distribution &amp; Crashlytics.</li><li>Many, many more.</li></ol><p><strong>Being Googleâ€™s product, it also integrates well with GCP.</strong> It blends with it more and more with every release and I suppose that soon, these two will be fully merged.</p><p>Having all these solutions in a single place, governed by the same IAM services and configured the same gives you a great advantage right at the beginning. It allows you to focus on what matters, leaving all the gritty details to Firebase. Even if you end up needing some more advanced backend features, you can always use <strong>Cloud Functions</strong> and do it the <em>normal way</em>.</p></div></div></div></section><section><div><div><div><div><p><img alt="" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iNzUiIGhlaWdodD0iMzgiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA3NSAzOCIgZmlsbD0ibm9uZSIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIj48cGF0aCBkPSJNNC4wODcgMzhMMCAzMy45NTEgMTQuODUgMTkuMDMgMCA0LjEwNyA0LjA4NyAwbDE4Ljg4IDE5LjAyOUw0LjA4NiAzOHptMjUuOTU5IDBsLTQuMDMtNC4wNDlMNDAuODY4IDE5LjAzIDI2LjAxNyA0LjEwNyAzMC4wNDcgMGwxOC45MzYgMTkuMDI5TDMwLjA0NiAzOHptMjYuMDE3IDBsLTQuMDg3LTQuMDQ5IDE0Ljg1LTE0LjkyMi0xNC44NS0xNC45MjJMNTYuMDYzIDAgNzUgMTkuMDI5IDU2LjA2MyAzOHoiIGZpbGw9IiMwMDAiLz48L3N2Zz4="></p></div></div><div><h2><strong>Examples</strong></h2><p><br>Firestore is great for many things.

With Firestore, we were able to handle all of the cases and give our users a solution that works everywhere, even in very remote areas, without that much of a development.Â&nbsp;</p><p>There are tons of other places where Firestore is a great solution, but Firestore simplicity can take its toll. Where Firestore shines and simplifies things at the beginning, it can make your hair gray after the application gets complicated enough.

<p>In this article, I will be describing my experience preparing for and taking the CKAD exam. A little bit about my background to relate with if you’re also on the same boat as I was: I am primarily a Software Developer; I’ve used mostly Python and Go. I have some experience in shell scripting and nearly negligible experience in DevOps.</p>
<p>First, we’ll spell out what the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer exam is. According to <a href="https://www.cncf.io/certification/ckad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the CNCF website</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The Certified Kubernetes Application Developer exam certifies that users can design, build, configure, and expose cloud-native applications for Kubernetes.” </p><cite><a href="https://www.cncf.io/certification/ckad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNCF</a></cite></blockquote>
<p>I recommend going through the CNCF website to understand the curriculum, exam tips, and other FAQs.</p>
<p>We’ll now dig into what it took me, an absolute beginner to DevOps, to prepare for the CKAD exam.</p>
<p>There are a few fundamental prerequisites such as Linux know-how, YAML configuration, Docker, etc., that one must know before proceeding to the Kubernetes world. I find the <a href="https://kodekloud.com/p/learning-path" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learning path</a> recommended on the <a href="https://kodekloud.com/courses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KodeKloud</a> website to be especially helpful to plan the order of learning the prerequisites.</p>

<p>I did the following courses offered by KodeKloud (this is most definitely not a plug for KodeKloud, you may learn all of these from other sources if you wish) in the order listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Linux </strong>– <strong>The Linux Basics Course</strong>. This course might not be necessary for everyone. If you’re familiar with the Linux terminal, basic commands, and comfortable using the Linux terminal, then you’re good to go.</p>
<p><strong>Automation</strong> – <strong>Ansible for Beginners.</strong> It is essential to understand how the YAML configuration works and know the data structures used in a YAML file. This course explains all of this and provides exercises for hands-on practising, among other topics.</p>
<p><strong>Docker – Docker for Absolute Beginners, Docker – SWARM | SERVICES | STACKS</strong>. Before jumping directly to Kubernetes, I think it is essential to understand the fundamentals of containers and container-based systems. Learning about the Docker platform is a great way to start with it. Once you are familiar with the basics of Docker, proceed further to learn advanced topics such as Docker Swarm, Services, etc., These courses should provide you with a pretty strong foundation to being learning Kubernetes.</p>
<p><strong>Kubernetes – Kubernetes for the Absolute Beginners, Certified Kubernetes Application Developer</strong>. These courses explain the core concepts in Kubernetes very well. The content of the CKAD course is tailor-made to fit the CKAD exam curriculum. Working through these courses, their practice materials, and mock exam should give one enough idea about the actual exam. I would also like to add that only these courses might not be sufficient to excel in the exam. Find more resources to help you practice.</p>
<p>What I find noteworthy about these courses is that KodeKloud provides a virtual lab to practice what you have learnt right away. Personally, for me, this is a huge plus. If you have only been watching a bunch of videos without getting your hands dirty, then it is not going to be of much use.</p>
<p>Other helpful resources to prepare for the exam:</p>
<ol type="1"><li><a href="https://github.com/dgkanatsios/CKAD-exercises" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/dgkanatsios/CKAD-exercises</a> – This is extremely helpful for more practice questions.</li><li>Even more practice – <a href="https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/practice-enough-with-these-questions-for-the-ckad-exam-2f42d1228552" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/practice-enough-with-these-questions-for-the-ckad-exam-2f42d1228552</a></li></ol>
<h2>Tips for pulling off the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer exam</h2>
<p>There are a few key aspects that will help you with the exam.</p>
<ol type="1"><li><strong>Familiarity</strong> – Familiarize yourself with the exam curriculum, the kubectl command, exporting to a yaml definition file (instead of writing one from scratch), and editing it as needed.</li><li><strong>Practice</strong> – The more you practice, the more familiar you are with the commands and shortcuts you learn along the way. Practising will also help you respond faster.</li><li><strong>Speed</strong> – Speed is particularly crucial to ace the exam. You have about 2 hours to answer 19 questions. And each of these questions may have sub-tasks. Again, at the cost of repeating myself, practice, practice, keep practising!</li><li><strong>Helpful resources during the exam</strong> – You do not have to remember definitions of all the Kubernetes resources. You have access to Kubernetes documentation during the exam to look up any information you want. Besides documentation, you can also use the <strong>‘kubectl explain’</strong> command to look up any resource. Learn how to use the <strong>‘kubectl explain’ </strong>command to your advantage, as this will save you a lot of time.</li><li><strong>Time awareness </strong>– Be aware of the amount of time you spend on each question. Some might require only a couple of minutes, while others require more. Skim through all the questions quickly, make a mental estimate of the time you will have to spend on each of them.</li><li><strong>WiFi – </strong>Ensure that you have seamless internet connectivity to avoid disruptions during your exam.</li><li>Be physically and mentally prepared to sit through the exam for about 2 hours with no break. I know you could take breaks in between, but that will cost you time. So, be prepared.</li></ol>
<p>Ensure that you’re well-rested. Do not stress yourself about the exam as it will only hinder your performance. Even if you do not pass the exam on your first try, you can retake the exam once more. You will have gained insight into the exam expectations, which will surely help you prepare well for your next try. Keep calm and give your best 😊</p>

</blockquote>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Media manipulation through images and videos has been around for decades. For example, during <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4984364/How-Hitler-Mussolini-Lenin-used-photo-editing.html">WWII, Mousollini released a propaganda image</a> of himself on a horse with his horse handler edited out. The goal was to make himself seem more impressive and powerful <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. These types of tricks can have significant impacts given the scale of the audience, especially in the internet era. <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/media-forensics">DARPA has constructed an entire program</a> to develop media forensics methods for detecting manipulated media <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/12/deep-fakes-fake-news-truth">Fake news may one day pale in comparison to the impact of deepfake news</a> <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>. Deepfakes are a set of Computer Vision methods that can create doctored images or videos with uncanny realism. In recent years, they have been blowing up in both quality and popularity. The term deepfake comes from a “fake” image or video generated by a “deep” learning algorithm. You’ve likely seen a video of a movie scene with actors face-swapped with a scary degree of accuracy.</p>

</figure>

<p>This technology has the potential to provide malicious actors with the means to sow unprecedented amounts of disinformation because it is far cheaper and more accessible than traditional special effects techniques used in Hollywood when it comes to creating videos with realistic face-swaps. This is concerning, since fake news is already prevalent and people are all too often believing news with little to no evidence <sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>. Just recently, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/01/tech/false-biden-video-twitter/index.html">a deceptively-edited video making it look like Joe Biden didn’t know what state he is in got 1 million views on Twitter</a> <sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>. Deepfakes could provide “evidence” to people who are looking to further their cognitive dissonance around disinformation. This is a real threat, with two bills <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3230/text">H. R. 3230</a>,<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/3805/text">S. 3805</a> having already been proposed in Congress to counter the spread of deepfakes for illegal purposes.</p>

</figure>

<p>Since the term was coined in 2017, the amount of detected deepfakes on the internet has been increasing exponentially. At the same time, the underlying AI methods to generate deepfakes have improved, as have user-friendly tools that allow one to easily create deepfakes without in-depth technical knowhow. In this blog post, I’m going to go over some background behind deepfakes, what they have been used for, and how to counter them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A deepfake refers to a specific kind of synthetic media where a person in an image or video is swapped with another person’s likeness. -<a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/deepfakes-explained">Meredith Somers</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Synthetic image and video generation have been a growing computer vision subfields, and they got a lot of momentum with the introduction of generative adversarial networks (GAN) in 2014 <sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8">6</a></sup>. The term “deepfake” was first coined by a Reddit user in 2017 who was using the technology to create fake pornography of celebrities using face swaps <sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10">7</a></sup>. Since then, the term has evolved to cover a wider range of image and video augmentations and generation as well as some audio applications.</p>

<p>Deepfakes come in a variety of forms according to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.11138.pdf#page=34&amp;zoom=100,65,305">Mirsky and Lee</a> <sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9">8</a></sup>. Here are examples of different types of deep fakes on a woman’s face:</p>

<h3 id="reenactment">Reenactment</h3>
<p>aka Using your facial or body movements to dictate the movements of another person</p>

<p>Current works in reenactment are looking to minimize the amount of training data that is needed to be able to generate a modified face. One-shot and few-shot learning have become popular approaches to utilize data from many different faces but only need to fine tune on a select few samples of their target face. Some of the leading methods here are <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.08139.pdf">MarioNETte</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.09224.pdf">FLNet</a>.</p>

    <figcaption><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.11138.pdf">(source)</a></figcaption>    
</figure>

<h3 id="replacement">Replacement</h3>
<p>aka Your identity is mapped to another person (for example the face swap filter on Snapchat)</p>

<p>Many replacement works apply either encoder-decoder networks or variational autoencoders to learn to map the source face to the target while retaining the same expressions. Common challenges that come up with replacement is the need to deal with occlusions, when an object passes in front of the target’s face. Recent replacement models include <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.13457">FaceShifter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/shaoanlu/faceswap-GAN">FaceSwap-GAN</a>.</p>

<h3 id="editing">Editing</h3>
<p>aka Altering the attributes of a person in some way (like changing their age or glasses)</p>

</figure>

<h3 id="synthesis">Synthesis</h3>
<p>aka Generating completely new images or videos with no target person</p>

    <figcaption><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.11138.pdf">(source)</a></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Reenactment and replacement are the two most prominent types of deepfakes, since they have the highest potential for destructive applications. For example, the face of a politician could be reenacted to say something they never actually said, or a person’s face could be replaced into an incriminating video for blackmail purposes. These types of manipulated media (deepfake or not) can be incriminating and/or harmful to the target’s reputation, like the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/01/tech/false-biden-video-twitter/index.html">post of Biden mentioned earlier</a> in which signs that said the name of the state were edited to make it look like he didn’t know where he was.</p>

<p>At the core of the concern about deepfakes is the fact that they make reenactment and replacement accessible and cheap; you don’t have to understand the details of the techniques involved to be able to create deepfakes. Tools like <a href="https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab">DeepFaceLab</a> allow anyone to take an image or video and replace a face, de-age a face, or manipulate a speech. For really seamless deepfakes, tools like this will provide a high quality generation of a face, but you still need some experience in video editing software like Adobe After Effects to add them to a video. If you don’t have the desire or ability to make them yourself, you can even find services and marketplaces willing to create deepfakes for you. One example is <a href="https://deepfakesweb.com/">https://deepfakesweb.com/</a> where you just have to upload videos and images you want, and they will create a deepfake for you in the cloud.</p>

<h2 id="how-are-deepfakes-being-used">How are deepfakes being used?</h2>

    <figcaption>Data as of 2019 from a total off 14,678 detected videos <a href="https://sensity.ai/mapping-the-deepfake-landscape/">(source)</a></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When deepfakes first gained popularity in 2017, they were overwhelmingly used in internet forums to generate fake pornography of celebrities. Even in 2019, 96% of all publicly posted deepfakes were pornographic, according to a <a href="https://sensity.ai/mapping-the-deepfake-landscape/">survey</a> done by the company <a href="https://sensity.ai/about/">sensity</a>. The targets of deepfakes (the people who have their faces swapped into deepfakes) are generally people who work in the entertainment industry.</p>

</figure>

<h3 id="deepfakes-in-media">Deepfakes in Media</h3>

<p>Aside from pornography, various online creators have been applying deepfakes to other forms of media, namely movie clips; individuals are constantly producing viral videos face swapping actors of movies with other actors. For example, in a recent YouTube video the faces of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Silvester Stalone were added to the movie Step Brothers <sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11">9</a></sup>.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://www.skynettoday.com/assets/img/overviews/2020-11-20-state-of-deepfakes-2020/image2.gif"> 
    <figcaption>Deepfake of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Silvester Stallone in the movie Step Brothers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXwmSFjlVc0">(source)</a></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>While such videos suggest deepfakes could prove to be useful for the entertainment industry, most of these viral videos have just been short demonstrations, and there has yet to be a major Hollywood production to utilize deepfakes. Though, some might say that Hollywood should already be using deepfakes. Netflix received a lot of criticism for the quality of the de-aging effect that was used in the movie “The Irishman”. In response, someone <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/news/the-irishman-deepfake">applied a de-aging deepfake to the movie and got impressive results</a>; perhaps it’s only a matter of time until Hollywood productions use these tools directly.</p>

<p>While no large blockbusters have used deepfakes, there are some accounts of smaller productions experimenting with deepfakes. Most notably, a producer has used deepfakes in his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/movies/deepfakes-documentary-welcome-to-chechnya.html">documentary about gay and lesbian persecution in Chechnya, to disguse the identities of the people being interviewed</a>.</p>

<p>As the examples above demonstrate, besides the possible negative uses of deepfakes, they can also lead to new possibilities when it comes to the entertainment industry. For instance, it could be really cool to be able to select which actor you want to watch in a movie. And, comedy impersonations like on Saturday Night Live will no doubt also reach a whole new level with deepfakes. In fact, just the other week, the creators of South park, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, started a new comedy series on YouTube called “Sassy Justice” centered around using deepfakes for celebrity impersonations. If you’re a fan of South Park you should definitely check it out:</p>

<h3 id="deepfakes-in-politics">Deepfakes in Politics</h3>

<p>Whenever a deepfake video gains attention online, there are always numerous comments from people expressing their concerns about using deepfakes to influence politics for nefarious purposes. These concerns are definitely valid, since in the information age being able to flood the internet with fake media about your political opponents that can fool viewers eyes and ears could be disastrous. To date, there have been quite a few deepfakes made addressing politics, many of which are satirical. One of the most popular was made by Jordan Peele where he reenacted Obama’s face <sup id="fnref:12" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:12">10</a></sup>. This was not done maliciously, but rather to raise awareness of the potential that deepfakes have to shape the political landscape.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Join us November 25, 2020 at 1 pm EST for ShipIt! Presents: The State of Ruby Static Typing at Shopify as we talk about static typing at Shopify. We’ll share why we chose Sorbet for the monolith and the lessons we learned along the way the&nbsp;way. <a href="#ShipIt">Please Register</a>.</strong></em></p>
<p>Shopify changes a lot. We merge around 400 commits to the main branch daily and deploy a new version of our core monolith 40 times a day. The Monolith is also big: 37,000 Ruby files, 622,000 methods, more than 2,000,000 calls. At this scale with a dynamic language, even with the most rigorous review process and over 150,000 automated tests, it’s a challenge to ensure everything&nbsp;runs smoothly. Developers benefit from a short feedback loop to ensure the stability of our monolith for our merchants.</p>
<p>Since 2018, our Ruby Infrastructure team has looked at ways to make the development process safer, faster, and more enjoyable for Ruby developers. While Ruby is different from other languages and brings amazing features allowing Shopify to be what it is today, we felt there was a feature from other languages missing: <strong>static typing</strong>.</p>

<p>Even in 2018, typing for Ruby wasn't a novelty. A few attempts were made to integrate type annotations directly into the language or through external tools (RDL, Steep), or as libraries (dry-types).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which solution would best fit Shopify considering its codebase and culture? For the Ruby Infrastructure team, the best match for a typing solution needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Gradual typing: </strong>Typing a monolith isn't a simple task and can’t be done in a day. Our code evolves fast, and we can’t ask developers to stop coding while we add types to the existing codebase. We need flexibility to add types without blocking the development process or limiting our ability to satisfy merchants needs.</li>
<li>
<strong>Speed</strong>: Considering the size of Shopify’s codebase, speed is a concern. If our goal is to provide quick feedback on errors and remove pressure from continuous integration (CI), we need a solution that’s fast.</li>
<li>
<strong>Full Ruby support</strong>: We use all of Ruby at Shopify. Our culture embraces the language and benefits from all features, even hard to type ones like metaprogramming, overloading, and class reopening. Support for Rails is also a must. From code elegance to developer happiness, the chosen solution needs to be compatible as much as possible with all Ruby features.</li>
</ul>
<p>With such a list of requirements, none of the contenders at the time could satisfy our needs, especially the speed requirement. We started thinking about developing our own solution, but a perfectly timed meeting with Stripe, who were working on a solution to the problem, introduced us to <a href="https://sorbet.org/" target="_blank" title="Sorbet is a fast, powerful type checker designed for Ruby" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sorbet</a>.</p>
<p>Sorbet was closed-source at the time and under heavy development but was already promising. It’s built for gradual typing with phenomenal performance (able to analyze 100,000 lines per second per core) making it significantly faster than running automated tests. It can handle hard to type things like metaprogramming, thanks to Ruby Interface files (RBI). This is how, at the start of 2019, Shopify began its journey toward static type checking for Ruby.</p>

<p>With only a three-person team and a lot on our plate, fully typing our monolith with Sorbet was going to be an approach based on Shopify’s <a href="https://vimeo.com/456735890" target="_blank" title="Shopify - How we Get Shit Done" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Get Shit Done (GSD) framework</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>We tested the viability of Sorbet on our core monolith by only typing a few files, to check if we could observe benefits from it while not impairing other developers’ work. Sorbets’ gradual approach proved to be working.</li>
<li>We manually created RBI files to represent what Sorbet could not understand yet. We checked we supported Ruby’s most advanced features as well as Rails constructs.</li>
<li>We added more and more files while keeping an eye on performance ensuring Sorbet would scale with our monolith.</li>
</ol>
<p>This gave us confidence Sorbet was the right choice to solve our problem. Once we officially decided to go with Sorbet we reflected on how we can reach 100% adoption in the monolith. To determine our roadmap we looked at:</p>
<ul>
<li>how many files needed to be typed</li>
<li>the content of the files</li>
<li>the Ruby features they used.</li>
</ul>

<p>Type checking in Sorbet comes in different levels of strictness. The strictness is defined on a per file basis by adding a magic comment in the file, called a <em>sigil</em>, written <code># typed: LEVEL</code>, where <code>LEVEL</code> can be one of the following:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>ignore</strong>: At this level, the file is not even read by Sorbet, and no errors are reported for this file at all.</li>
<li>
<strong>false</strong>: Only errors related to syntax, constant resolution and correctness of sigs are reported. At this level sorbet doesn’t check the calls in the files even if the methods called don't exist anywhere in the codebase.</li>
<li>
<strong>true</strong>: This is the level where Sorbet actually starts to type check your code. All methods called need to exist in the code base. For each call, Sorbet will check that the arguments count matches the method definition. If the method has a signature, Sorbet will also check their types.</li>
<li>
<strong>strict</strong>: At this level all methods must have a signature, and all constants and instance variables must have explicitly annotated types.</li>
<li>
<strong>strong</strong>: Sorbet no longer allows untyped variables. In practice, this level is actually unusable for most files because Sorbet can’t type everything yet and even Stripe advises against using it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once we were able to run Sorbet on our codebase, we needed a way to track our progress and identify which parts of our monolith were typed with which strictness or which parts needed more work. To do so we created SorbetMetrics, a tool able to collect and display metrics about typing coverage for all our internal projects. We started tracking three key metrics to measure Sorbet adoption :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Sigils</strong>: how many files are typed <code>ignore</code>, <code>false</code>, <code>true</code>, <code>strict</code> or <code>strong</code>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Calls</strong>: how many calls are sent to a method with a signature</li>
<li>
<strong>Signatures</strong>: how many methods have a signature</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Bar graph showing increased Sorbet usage in projects over time. Below the bar graph is a table showing the percentage of sigils, calls, signatures in each project." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/sorbet-dashboard_ef9747c0-3326-4b45-bbe9-59a1680718f2.jpg?v=1605798789" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/sorbet-dashboard_ef9747c0-3326-4b45-bbe9-59a1680718f2.jpg?v=1605798789"><br><em>SorbetMetrics dashboard homepage</em></p>
<p>Each day SorbetMetrics pulls the latest version of our monolith and other Shopify projects using Sorbet, computes those metrics and displays them in a dashboard internally available to all our developers.</p>

<p>If we treat typing as a product, we also need to focus on supporting and enabling our “customers” who are developers at Shopify. One of our goals was to have a strong support system in place to help with any problems that arise and slow developers down.</p>
<p>Initially, we supported developers with a dedicated Slack channel where Shopifolk could ask questions to the team. We’d answer these questions real-time and help Shopifolk with typing efforts where our input was important.</p>
<p>This white glove support model obviously didn't scale, but it was an excellent learning opportunity for our team—we now understood the biggest challenges and recurring problems. We ended up solving some problems over and over again, but it solidified the effort to understand the patterns and decide which features to work on next.</p>
<p>Using Slack meant our answers weren't discoverable forever. We moved most of the support and conversation to our internal Discourse platform, increasing discoverability and broader sharing of knowledge. This also allows us to record solutions in a single place and let developers self-serve as much as possible. As we onboard more and more projects with Sorbet, this solution scales better.</p>

<p>Going further from unblocking our users, we also need to ensure their happiness. Sorbet and more generally static typing in Ruby wouldn’t be a good fit for us if it made our developers miserable. We’re aware that it introduces a bit more work, so the benefits need to balance with the inconvenience.</p>
<p>Our first tool to measure developers’ opinions of Sorbet is surveys. Twice a year, we send a “Typing @ Shopify” survey to all developers and collect their sentiments regarding Sorbet’s benefits and limitations, as well as what we should focus on in the future.</p>
<p><img alt="A bar graph showing the increasing strongly agree answer over time to the question I want Sorbet to be applied to other Shopify projects. Below that graph is a bar graph showing the increasing strongly agree answer over time to the question I want more code to be typed." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Sobert-at-Shopify-Survey-Results-1.jpg?v=1605764198" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Sobert-at-Shopify-Survey-Results-1.jpg?v=1605764198"><br><em>Some responses&nbsp;from our “Sorbet @ Shopify” surveys</em></p>
<p>We use simple questions (“yes” or “no”, or a “Strongly Disagree” (1) to “Strongly Agree” (5) scale) and then look at how the answers evolve over time. The&nbsp;survey results gave us&nbsp;interesting insights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sorbet catches more errors on developer’s pull requests (PR) as adoption increased</li>
<li>Signatures help with code understanding and give developers confidence to ship</li>
<li>Added&nbsp;confidence&nbsp;directly impacted&nbsp;the increasing positive opinion about static typing in Ruby</li>
<li>Over time developers&nbsp;wanted more code and more projects to be typed</li>
<li>Developers get used to Sorbet syntax over time</li>
<li>IDE integration with Sorbet is a feature developers are rooting for</li>
</ul>
<p>Our main observation is that developers enjoy Sorbet more as the typing coverage increases. This is one reason that's increasing our motivation to reach 100% of files at <code>typed: true</code> and maximize the amount of methods with a signature.</p>
<p>The second tool is interviews with individual developers. We select a team working with Sorbet and meet each member to talk about their experience using Sorbet either in the monolith or on another project. We get a better understanding of what their likes and dislikes are, what we should be improving, but also how we can better support them when introducing Sorbet, so the team keeps Sorbet in their project.</p>

<p>Currently, Sorbet is only enforced on our main monolith and we have about 60 other internal projects that opted to use Sorbet as well. On our main monolith, we require all files to be at least <code>typed: false</code> and Sorbet is run on our continuous integration platform (CI) for every PR and fails builds if type checking errors are found. We’re currently evaluating the idea of enforcing valid type checking on CI even before running the automated tests.</p>
<p><img alt="Three pie charts showing percentage of sigils, calls, and signatures in the monolith used to measure Sorbet adoption" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Typing-Coverage-Shopify-Monolith.jpg?v=1605764949" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Typing-Coverage-Shopify-Monolith.jpg?v=1605764949"><br><em>Typing coverage metrics for Shopify’s monolith</em></p>
<p>As of today, 80% of our files (including tests) are <code>typed: true</code> or higher. Almost half of our calls are typed and half of our methods have signatures. All of this can be type checked under 15 seconds on our developers machines.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
 		
<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about corporate knowledge management systems recently.</p>



<p>If we think about a company as an organism, then a knowledge management system is essentially the (collective) brain that keeps that organism alive and running. A corporate knowledge management system should contain every single bit of codifiable information within the company resulting in a library of all projects, processes and procedures.</p>



<p>In an ideal state, it is the single source of truth that helps to inform every individual in the firm about what everyone else is up to. Information should be easy to add (input) as well as easy to search and find (output) resulting in quick knowledge transfer between different employees.</p>



<p>In reality, however, this hardly ever is the case. As anyone who has ever worked at a larger company can attest to, company knowledge bases always end up being a huge mess. </p>



<p>What starts with a neatly organized Confluence wiki, over time morphs into a multi-headed monster consisting of millions of notes and documents that live across Google Docs, Dropbox Paper, Asana and half a dozen different wiki tools. Most docs will be outdated, some will contradict others and the one you are really looking for only shows up on page 14 of your search results.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/monster-4.png"></p><p>It seems like things usually start to fall apart once a company surpasses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar number</a> of 150 employees. This is probably when people start to realize that all the different documents of <em>explicit knowledge</em> they were amassing over the years have been held together with <em>implicit knowledge</em>. </p>



<p>It’s easy to find – and understand – the right documents when you know every other person in the company, but once you’re past that point, you need a system to organize all the data so that people can make sense of it.</p>



<p>The idea behind tools like Notion is to solve this problem by using just one tool for all your different knowledge documents. Instead of Google Docs AND Asana AND Trello AND Airtable, you just do everything in Notion. This reduces complexity because you don’t have to switch and search across different apps. At the same time, Notion forces you to think about a system that makes information easy to find with its folder-like structure and links between different databases.</p>



<p>I’ve never used Notion with more than half a dozen people myself, but from what I’ve heard from people at larger companies, Notion knowledge bases also don’t scale very well beyond a certain number of users. Once too many people start contributing to it, things become bloated and unnavigable.</p>



<p>A friend at Stripe recently suggested – half-jokingly – that we should hire a librarian to organize all our internal data and documentation. The more I think about it, the more I like the idea. Perhaps every company should hire a Chief Notion Officer once it hits 100 employees?!</p>



<p>An alternative approach to Notion is a knowledge management system that can live across different tools and without active manual curation because it’s based on really powerful search. The folder structure of your Google Drive, for example, doesn’t <em>really</em> matter because looking up documents via search is faster and more convenient. Meta search tools like <a href="https://usefyi.com/">FYI</a> are supposed to offer the same but across different productivity tools.</p>



<p>But again I’m skeptical that this really works beyond a certain amount of users (and thus documents). I remember even Google’s internal search engine doing only a mediocre job of surfacing the most relevant documents (and even if it did you weren’t sure if there wasn’t a better or more up-to-date version of it).</p>



<p>I’m sure we’ll get there eventually, but until then we probably need a mix of automated search and manual human help – which is where Slack comes in. I’ve <a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1097940802737704960">always thought</a> Slack plus Notion plus <a href="https://www.atspoke.com/">Spoke</a> would make a really powerful product (and I’m surprised Slack hasn’t made any major acquisitions in this space).</p>



<p>If you think about it, Slack is basically a search engine powered by humans: Most Slack messages are just questions. <a href="https://kwokchain.com/2019/08/16/the-arc-of-collaboration/">It’s 911 for when everything else fails</a>. So if Slack had access to your entire knowledge base, it could answer at least the most commonly asked questions automatically. The rest would still get answered manually by the channel participants. Or your Chief Notion Officer.</p>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    

<p>I was trying to find a good use case for my <a href="https://www.banggood.com/LILYGO-TTGO-T-Watch-2020-ESP32-Main-Chip-1_54-Inch-Touch-Display-Programmable-Wearable-Environmental-Interaction-Watch-p-1671427.html">LILIGO TTGO T-Watch</a>. It’s a programmable smart watch featuring the amazing ESP32 chip and a 240x240 color LCD screen.</p>

<p>I keep hearing about Doom running on this and that, sometimes directly and sometimes using the device as an exotic external screen. My project falls into the latter category, but it was a lot of fun to implement!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As this was mostly a learning experience, I took several wrong turns and mention them in this writeup.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As with most of tiny projects, I got the basics version up and running on a two afternoons and then fiddled with the code for a few more days to get a more presentable result.</p>

<p><img src="http://jborza.com/assets/doom-watch-500.jpg" alt="alt"></p>

<p><em>It works!</em></p>

<h2 id="building-steps">Building steps</h2>

<h3 id="getting-the-video-signal-across">Getting the video signal across</h3>

<p>There are a couple of ways to transmit data from a computer to the ESP32-based watch. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and a serial port.</p>

<p>Serial port seemed promising - I initially targeted 120x120 picture, which can be represented by 14400 bits or 1800 bytes. Targeting 115200 bauds I could achieve around 7 fps (115200 / 16200 bauds per frame).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The default serial configuration is 8 data bits, no parity and one stop bit, hence 9 bauds per byte.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the goal was of displaying DOOM on the smart watch in mind, I thought. I decided to divide this into three phases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scale the image down to the resolution of the watch</li>
  <li>Implement a proof of concept serial display on the T-Watch</li>
  <li>Optimize until it works better</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="scaling-doom">Scaling Doom</h2>

<p>I started with finding a suitable Doom source port. I discovered  <a href="https://www.chocolate-doom.org/">Chocolate Doom</a>, which accurately reproduces the game as it was played in the 1990s.</p>

<p>Building it on Ubuntu is straightforward, so I dived straight into the code and started poking around.</p>

<h3 id="wrong-turn-1---modifying-doom-internal-resolution">Wrong turn #1 - modifying Doom internal resolution</h3>

<p>The first thing I did was try to find how a resolution gets set.</p>

<p>At first I tried to change the internal resolution of the renderer - there was a <code>#define</code>
for <code>SCREEN_WIDTH 320</code> and <code>SCREEN_HEIGHT 200</code> in <code>i_video.h</code>.</p>

<p>Changing this to 120x75 made the game crash. I attached a debugger to see where exactly and the game was attempting to render some things at locations beyond 120x75. Scaling all coordinates by 0.5x helped get the menu to display, but it crashed again as soon as I started the game.</p>

<h3 id="scaling-and-dithering">Scaling and dithering</h3>

<p>After studying the Chocolate Doom source port some more I realized it has a series of buffers and textures that represent stages of the <a href="https://github.com/chocolate-doom/chocolate-doom/blob/master/src/i_video.c#L780">rendering pipeline</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The engine itself draws assets with a <a href="https://zdoom.org/wiki/Palette">palette</a> to make a better use of 255 colors.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>the game is drawn into an 8-bit paletted 320x200 paletted screen buffer.</li>
  <li>blit into a 32-bit ARGB 320x200 buffer</li>
  <li>rendered into an upscaled texture using a nearest linear scaling (e.g. 640x400)</li>
  <li>rendered to the screen (e.g. 800x600) using linear scaling</li>
</ul>

<p>It was clear the dithering and output to the serial port should happen somewhere within this pipeline.</p>

<h3 id="wrong-turn-2">Wrong turn #2</h3>

<p>I realized looking at the screenshots from various buffers that I’ve been dithering the wrong display buffer (the 320x200 display buffer), then downscaled in SDL to 240x150, which caused artifacts and didn’t look as good.</p>

<p>The correct way was to scale the display buffer to 240x150, then dither, then send this over the wire.</p>

<h2 id="dithering">Dithering</h2>

<p>After a little research on 1-bit graphics I realized there are two commonly used dithering algorithms - I implemented both:</p>

<h3 id="ordered-dithering">Ordered dithering</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_dithering">Ordered dithering</a> is a simple algorithm that produces a characteristic crosshatch pattern.</p>

<p>It works by applying a threshold map to the pixels displayed, causing pixels from the map to change color based on the distance from the original color to black and white.</p>

<p><img src="http://jborza.com/assets/doom-ordered-4x4-matrix.png" alt="ordered dithering"></p>

<p><em>Ordered dithering patterns</em></p>

<h3 id="floyd-steinberg-dithering">Floyd-Steinberg dithering</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Steinberg_dithering">Floyd-Steinberg dithering</a> operates using error diffusion and is characterized by its grainy or speckled appearance.</p>

<p>Because Floyd-Steinberg works by pushing the quantization error from a pixel to its neighboring pixels, a slight change in the scene can propagate over the entire screen. I found that aesthetically less pleasing than the more predictable ordered dithering, as it was simply less jumpy.</p>

<p><img src="http://jborza.com/assets/doom-dither-240x150.png" alt="doom dithered"></p>

<p><em>Floyd-Steinberg dithering above, ordered dithering below</em></p>

<h3 id="grayscale-and-gamma">Grayscale and gamma</h3>

<p>In both dithering algorithms we convert the color to grayscale with the following algorithm:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>//get r,g,b color values</span>
<span>uint8_t</span> <span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>g</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span>
<span>uint32_t</span> <span>pix</span> <span>=</span> <span>getpixel</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>);</span>
<span>SDL_GetRGB</span><span>(</span><span>pix</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>format</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>g</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>b</span><span>);</span>
      
<span>// Convert the pixel value to grayscale / intensity</span>
<span>grayscale</span> <span>=</span> <span>.</span><span>299</span><span>f</span> <span>*</span> <span>r</span> <span>+</span> <span>.</span><span>587</span><span>f</span> <span>*</span> <span>g</span> <span>+</span> <span>.</span><span>114</span><span>f</span> <span>*</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Doom is quite dark, so it’s hard to see anything in the default <em>gamma</em> setting. Fortunately the engine also features gamma correction, that can be toggled with the <code>F11</code> key in game.</p>

<p><img src="http://jborza.com/assets/doom-gamma.png" alt="gamma"></p>

<p><em>Gamma settings 1, 3, 5 going from unusable in monochrome to pretty bright</em></p>

<h2 id="watch-as-an-external-display">Watch as an external display</h2>

<p>To make data transfer a bit less intensive I decided to transmit in 120x120 resolution and then double the pixels to 240x240 on the device.</p>

<p>Initially I programmed my watch to be a simple single-core serial display.
It reads one row of pixels from the serial port as 120 bits that represent black or white pixels, then expands each bit onto a 16-bit array value.</p>

<h4 id="transfer-rate">Transfer rate</h4>
<p>When transmitting 120x120 pixels at around 16 FPS we produce around 15 * 9 (data + stop bit) * 120 (rows) * 16 (fps) = 259 kbits of data per second.</p>

<p>The pixel conversion does the horizontal pixel doubling and prepares it to the  converts input (a 120 bits field) to the display line (240 16-bit pixels, stored in a 120 32-bit array). It iterates bit by bit .
We can display data on the TTGO T-Watch using the <a href="https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI">TFT_eSPI library</a>. It includes a <code>pushPixels</code> function that expects a buffer of 16-bit pixel colors.</p>

<p>I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/jborza/watch-doom-receiver/blob/master/util/sender.py">supporting tool</a> to feed the watch some pixels in Python. The bits are sent using the <code>pyserial</code> library in a loop.</p>

<h2 id="connecting-the-watch-and-doom">Connecting the Watch and Doom</h2>

<p>Python is not very helpful in the Chocolate Doom port, so I had to write the serial frame transmitter in C. 
I’ve adapted the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/38318768/72746">first code snippet I found</a> I found on Stack Overflow, credit goes to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/1599004/sawdust">sawdust</a>.</p>

<p>Still working in the 120x120 pixel resolution, this is how the intermediate result looked:</p>

<p><img src="http://jborza.com/assets/doom-120x120-watch.jpg" alt="first attempt"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s incredibly low-res. Also, because I was lazy, the last row of pixels of the status bar is leaking all the way down the screen as I just repeated rows 75 up to 120 in the output stream :-)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I eventually bumped the resolution to 240x150.</p>

<p>There’s nothing special about the serial output module, there’s a function that takes an <code>SDL_Surface</code> assuming its dimensions being 240x150, loops over the RGB values and for every row of 240 pixels (bits) spits out 30 bytes.</p>

<h2 id="getting-it-faster">Getting it faster</h2>

<p>Straightforward increase of the baudrate to 500,000 caused some screen tearing, it seemed that the <em>serial receiver</em> code on the watch was having hard time keeping up. After optimizing the bit conversion loop it could handle stable 500,000 bauds, leading to high enough framerate to consider increasing the resolution to 240x240.</p>

<h3 id="wrong-turn-3---going-multi-core-on-the-esp32">Wrong turn #3 - going multi-core on the ESP32</h3>

<p>I thought I could leverage the second core on the ESP32 and have the watch run two tasks - one that processes the serial data and another that decodes it and sends to the display.</p>

<p>I implemented a proof of concept serial display that uses the <a href="https://www.freertos.org/RTOS-task-notifications.html">FreeRTOS Task notification API</a> to communicate between the task using notifications.</p>

<p>It used two buffers - one to receive the serial data which got copied to the display task and the notifications were supposed to let the tasks know that they can touch the shared buffer.</p>

<p>The source lives in the <a href="https://github.com/jborza/watch-doom-receiver/blob/multithreaded/watch-doom-receiver.ino"><code>multithreaded</code> branch</a> - but it didn’t really work faster, which lead me to the next attempt:</p>

<h3 id="using-dma-for-the-speed">Using DMA for the speed</h3>

<p>What helped in the end was using Direct Memory Access (DMA) transfer using `  tft-&gt;pushPixelsDMA(lineBuffer, DISPLAY_LINE_LENGTH);`. It’s basically “fire and forget” data transfer - the controller will move the data from the RAM to the display and practically allow the microcontroller to execute other code as opposed to operating the SPI bus.</p>

<p>Now I could increase the baudrate to 921600 and practically double the framerate.</p>

<h4 id="vertical-synchronization">Vertical Synchronization?</h4>

<p>If we just dump the data to the screen without some kind of synchronization or alignment, the device wouldn’t know where the boundary between the frame data lies.</p>

<p>It also means we would need to be lucky to start the transmission in sync with the watch displaying the first row of the frame data.</p>

<p>To fix this, I added a simple VSYNC message that the watch sends to the PC over the serial port when it starts drawing the first row. Upon receiving VSYNC, the PC should start abandon the current frame and start sending another frame from the beginning. I’ve added a handler for this to the python support tools, but decided not to for Doom as it was easier to just reset the line currently being drawn if no data has come for a while across the serial port.</p>

<h2 id="finishing-touches">Finishing touches</h2>

<p>A series of color schemes livens up the 1-bit color depth - just black and white is kind of boring. This has a straightforward implementation on the T-Watch side, reacting to the touch of the touchscreen with <code>digitalRead(...)</code></p>

<p>Content marketing can be overwhelming for a business until the budget is there for bigger longterm communications programs. If you’re a startup owner or solo marketing manager, you’re already doing a lot with a little. But if you’re building a company, the time is already here to get started on content marketing, because content marketing is a long game that takes time and is an integral part of brand building. Many startups give up too soon, but you can handle content marketing, whether you do it yourself or hire it out. It doesn’t have to be fancy, but it does have to be focused in a few particular ways to succeed over time. You can start your own content marketing if you stay focused and don’t let initial slow traction get you down.</p>



<p>Cronicle Consulting presents a short Content Series: 5 Ways To Start Content Marketing For Your Tech Startup. This series will be split into 5 sections so stay tuned for the next articles. First up, starting a company blog. It’s the simplest way to start content marketing from day 1, and it will bring in results if you do it right. But most people don’t know how to focus their blog for optimum results, so it feels like a waste of time. That’s why we’re here to help you avoid common content marketing errors before you begin. Note: SEO is its own important topic and won’t be covered in the scope of this article.</p>



<h2>Content Marketing Plan #1: Company Blog</h2>



<p>Content marketing in a company blog not just about the content showing professional expertise or announcing company news. People want to know:</p>



<ol><li>what you’re like to work with.</li><li>how you view the world within your professional sphere.</li><li>how you communicate.</li></ol>



<p>Your blog is where prospective clients go to see how you interact with the world. When you start your company blog, begin by announcing the launch of the company. Then, tell your team story. Here are a few ideas to get started.</p>



<h3>Content Marketing Ideas For A Blog</h3>



<ol><li>tell your team story.</li><li>talk about the problem your product or service is solving in the world or what cause you are supporting.</li><li>announce new hires.</li><li>post job listings.</li><li>tell the story of company volunteering.</li><li>publish white papers and awards.</li><li>announce events and promotions.</li><li>publish your own industry research reports or host your own awards.</li><li>turn engineering expertise into mini e-books or published papers.</li><li>host round tables interviewing industry experts.</li><li>cover industry news.</li></ol>



<p>If you need to hire your company blog out to a communications firm, check out their other client blogs and see if they are matching the tone and content to the industry and if they know their technical stuff in depth. If all the blogs for various clients in different industries sound the same or too high level, move on to a different firm. Tech startups in particular have this problem. Addressing it early can help you avoid wasting your efforts. </p>

These days they are competitions, media exposure, and an opportunity to create print content and a community that grows over time. </figcaption></figure>



<h2>Tone, Focus &amp; Style in a Company Blog</h2>



<p>The tone of your company blog is critical: the vocabulary has to be right for the professional space being addressed, the focus of the content interesting to people in your field or your client space, and the communication style appropriate to your industry. Is the communication style in your space more formal or jocular? Is it interested in the broader social good, or does your circle tend to focus on technical details of research and problem solving industry issues? Once you get the hang of focus through trial and error and having someone with industry-specific content expertise create your blog, a company blog is one of the best ways to keep your website popping up in organic search results on topics potential clients are searching for, and you’ve pre-sold a lot of people on working with your team. </p>



<h3>Appropriate Blog Tone Varies By Industry</h3>



<p>We cannot emphasize enough getting the tone right. The problem with content marketing is that it falls to the marketing folks most of the time instead of an in-house journalist, which only larger companies have budget for. If you are a marketing manager versed in content that’s great. If you’re not sure if you’re doing this correctly, one way to check is to make sure you don’t use quite the same tone for sales copy as you do for the company blog. Think about the tone of how people within the organization communicate with each other and with clients, and use that as a guide instead. Why? Because it all begins to sound like a sales pitch otherwise, and that is not at all what content is for. Client storytelling works best when it’s done in the tone that makes people sound the most professional, or the friendliest, or the best suited to solve a client’s problems. Sales copy often accomplishes this only in direct pitches. </p>



<h3>You Are Not The Hero Of The Story, You Are The Bard</h3>



<p>Content is your chance to provide good will to the world, information for free that benefits them. The best way to do this is to talk about causes your company believes in, promote the good work of colleagues, and position yourself as the cheerleader to someone else as the hero of the story. If it starts to sound like “we have the best culture, look how amazing our culture is at this workplace here, check us out, guys” it’s going to turn a lot of people off subconsciously to listening to what you actually have to offer. What you actually have to offer is a whole lot of wisdom and thought leadership that the world probably needs. The aim here is to tell the story you want to tell, but think of yourself as the support role or the cheerleader, not the hero. Just that simple shift will make your story sound so much more beneficial to the reader, and will cut out the feeling of awkwardness that can come from self-promotion.</p>

Creating, publishing, or sponsoring a report like this can be very useful content. </figcaption></figure>



<h3>Company Blog Style Is Tailored To The Blog’s Purpose</h3>



<p>Keep company blog content styled in a way that fits your brand and how you want to present your organization to the world. This often swings several directions off track.</p>



<h4>Common Company Blog Errors:</h4>



<ol><li>Your company blog sounds too much like a sales pitch for culture.</li><li>Your company blog is all jargon and no specifics on your offerings.</li><li>Your company blog is all about your company.</li></ol>



<p>Number 1 depends on if you work in an industry that relies heavily on people’s buy-in to a particular culture. Some company blogs do get away with a particular tone that sounds almost cultish, but often this is a turnoff for prospective hires and clients. To avoid this common mistake in a world of business websites that are nothing but culture pitch, focus on the benefit to the client. What do they want to know about? What are they searching for? What helps them? It’s a great approach for creating content that people are more likely to be searching for anyway. </p>



<p>Number 2 is actually debatable. There are industries in which a jargon-heavy website is appropriate. “We deliver on deadline on spec with the most disruptive innovation imaginable.” Except what do you deliver? Well, sometimes industries communicate exclusively in industry jargon, and that’s properly communicating professional expertise and the right pitch. But it does wear thin on long-form content. If you work in an industry that’s super jargon heavy, try to keep the jargon to the static pages, and the blog should go more in depth into what you’re working on, as much as you can afford to share. Many industries such as automotive, advanced manufacturing, defense contracting, and the like are not able to publish the same kind of company blog because of NDAs and heavy restrictions on proprietary information. Biotech would be another good example. You want clients to know what you could offer them, but all details are often available in house after demos and personal contact with a client and most sales handled directly. In this case, if you still want to publish a company blog, keep it to the new hires, press releases, new services offered, and details of presentations from trade shows, which can be fun to read about. </p>



<p>Number 3 is tricky. Many company blogs don’t have time to move past basic company press releases, but if you can make the time, reporting on industry news can be one of the most powerful ways to establish your company as an industry leader in the space. The style of your blog needs to be determined by whom you are serving. Biotech companies often focus very much on direct sales to clients, but a security startup needs to establish themselves as a leader in the industry thought leadership space. Their blog should be focused on industry standards, industry problem solving, and innovative solutions and conversations that serve the broader space. </p>



<p>But everyone’s already doing this these days, right? Not quite. It takes a good marketing manager or journalist to spot the common flaw. Most company blogs talk about the company or their ability or authority to report on industry news far more than they produce actual content that is valuable to the reader. Journalism requires funding, and it doesn’t come for free even if the cost is giving your marketing team space to produce quality content in house. This is where companies think content marketing doesn’t work and tend to fall off over time to focus on other marketing. If your company promotes themselves as an industry thought leader but only talks about how central they are to the ecosystem and how many events they’re hosting or attending to prove their relevance, they can come across as insecure or bragging or …</p></div></div>

But why? Was it because our dreams were straight-up stupid? Or because we settled and decided they were impossible?&nbsp;</p><p>I want to explore this question as a kid who <strong>still</strong> has lots of ambitious dreams and <strong>wants</strong> <strong>to eat the world.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Lately, I’ve experienced that my goals and dreams might be stupid or impossible. But why? If I think they are. They will be impossible because I won’t even try. I have to keep reminding myself that they are not and keep believing they are and can be possible.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ambition starts fragile</strong>, we need to feed it to keep going[1]. Steven Spielberg said, “Dreams always come from behind you, not right between your eyes. But when you have a dream, it doesn’t often come at you screaming in your face...Sometimes the dream almost whispers.” And you have to <strong>listen</strong> very <strong>carefully</strong>...</p><p>Ambition has more to do with <em>listening carefully </em>than it is with anything else. You need to be sensitive to <strong>what you want </strong>and <strong>why you want it.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Ambition can be grown and cared for like a garden. You start small and you constantly prune and iterate it.&nbsp;</p><p>Ask yourself what you love and what sacrifices you’re willing to make to pursue your goals.&nbsp;</p><p>Many people don’t just lose their ambition (some get even more ambitious as they get older) but most people don’t ask themselves these questions and life happens to them.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>I’ve realized that being ambitious isn’t about trying to become rich or famous, but more about knowing what you want and why you want it. Once you know that, you’ll be more likely to sacrifice and push through all the obligations and randomness of life, and finally accomplish your dreams.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>So, <strong>Why the fuck do we lose our ambition when we grow up?</strong></p><p>Losing our ambition is like losing our soul and excitement to be alive. We’re saying, “Nope, I refuse to fully live.” Being ambitious isn’t about becoming famous or billionaire. It’s about fully living.</p><p>Socrates said once, “The unexamined life is not worth living,” meaning living a life under the rule of others, never questioning what you want out of it is not <strong>worth</strong> <strong>living. </strong>&nbsp;And let me make sure you know this too, a life with no aim and with no purpose isn’t an alternative either.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re young or whatever age you are, and want to be ambitious. Be aware of the reasons people lose their ambition.&nbsp; What are those reasons? There are many reasons, but there’s one that expresses the essential reasons: <strong>Change of priorities.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>People get comfortable, which makes them lose sight of the big picture, and you add responsibilities and obligations. You get the average adult. This is often true, but not always. Sometimes, people change what they’re ambitious for. Kids want to be astronauts, teens want to change the world, and adults want to spend time with their families.&nbsp;</p><p>Which is one right? Neither. You choose. The issue occurs when your priorities change without you realizing it. You may WANT to change your priorities, just be aware of the WHY.&nbsp;</p><p>Even if you don’t change your priorities, there’s another reason that is probably the biggest contributor.</p><p>“Everyone wants to be a published author, nobody wants to write a book.” This isn’t about becoming a published author, but an example of a high-status goal that many people grow up aspiring to, that turns out to require you to work hard over a long time.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/" target="_blank">Patrick McKenzie </a>elaborates more on this idea and says, “One of my most disconcerting observations about the world is that the number of people who will, in their life, pursue a concrete goal with focus and determination for several months is *much much lower* than what I would have assumed it would be.”&nbsp;</p><p>Why are some people more determined than others? Or why do others never give despite failing repeatedly? A harsh truth many people refuse to accept.&nbsp;</p><h2>Destined to Fail, Arriving Successfully</h2><p>Look, youngsters my age (17) or older haven’t experienced true failure in their life. Why? Most of them because they haven’t really tried anything. To fail, you have to try. If you never try, you never fail.&nbsp;</p><p>Since early on, we take pre-planned paths such as standardized testing and getting A’s. As long as you do nothing dumb and do what teachers tell you, you will be fairly successful. Just be complacent and follow others. Simple, right?<br></p><p>Real-life is not like that.&nbsp;</p><p>Once you graduate college and you are finally dropped off at the so-called “real world” with no instructions. Most people struggle with how to be <strong>successful. </strong>You try things and you fail.&nbsp;</p><p>The first failures are rough because you aren’t used to them, so they are cruelly painful. Like when you told that one girl in fourth grade you liked her, but she rejected you. Well, maybe it’s not that painful.&nbsp;</p><p>You try things and you fail. Then one of two things takes place. You either try again and learn and improve or you avoid pain altogether.&nbsp;</p><p>Again, neither is right nor wrong. Each one comes with pros and cons.&nbsp;</p><p>The first option of trying things and failing is a lot tougher short-term but benefits people long term. Few people take this road because humans love <strong>comfort </strong>and avoid <strong>pain.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The second option of avoiding pain is far more common and causes people to stick with jobs and careers they don’t like because it’s “too hard” to change. This road is easier in the short-term but leads many people to become depressed and “giving up,” which is what I’m talking about when people grow up and “lose ambition.”</p><p>Enough of my ranting. How do you know what road to take?&nbsp;</p><h2>Choose a life that makes sense to YOU!</h2><p>Every young person wants to be unique. We want to dream and we want to inspire others. But that doesn’t always happen because lots of times it’s easier to follow what <strong>others say </strong>and do what<strong> others do.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Many people reason by analogy (because someone did it), and few reason by truths or <a href="https://www.techtello.com/first-principles-thinking/" target="_blank">first principles</a> (what do I think is true for sure?).&nbsp;</p><p>To think for yourself independently of others takes more mental output and yes it’s freaking hard, but only if you do, you can start <strong>fully living.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Being ambitious isn’t for everyone, but most people should dare to try it. Yes, it’s harder, tiring, and perhaps even meaningless. But I’m still ambitious.</p><p>Nothing that we’ll ever do will matter. Nothing. If you look at the world not in years or centuries, but in billions of years. Few things will matter. So why even bother?</p><p>At first, you may become nihilistic but if you look at it more carefully, you’ll realize that because nothing will matter, you might as well try to optimize every minute you live by helping others, being happier, loving more, and being more ambitious.&nbsp;</p><h2>I Refuse to Wait</h2><p><strong>Young Human:</strong> I want to eat the world.</p><p><strong>Old Human:</strong> Try to not get eaten first, kid.</p><p><strong>Young Human:</strong> (says nothing and thinks to himself, “Who was the weirdo who looks like he was eaten?”</p><p><strong>Old Human: </strong>You’ll understand…</p><p>___________</p><p>Perhaps I’m dumb for trying to be ambitious and even dumber for trying to help others to see if being ambitious makes sense for them. Like <a href="https://twitter.com/Lexstok/status/1309371088498053120?s=20" target="_blank">someone told me on Twitter</a>, “Bookmark this tweet, set a timer for 20 years, and you’ll be able to answer this yourself by then.”</p><p>But I refuse to wait twenty years. I would rather try to learn from the mistakes of other people and have an answer that makes sense for me. An answer that aligns with what I think, what I say, and what I do.&nbsp;</p><p>That answer is that being ambitious is worth it. It’s not about being rich or famous but understanding what you want and why you want it while treating ambition like a garden that can be grown and cared for.&nbsp;</p><p>If you can listen carefully and <em>garden </em>your ambition, you can start <strong>fully living</strong> the life you want and choose for yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, remember priorities might change. You thought you wanted to be an astronaut, but now all you want to do is play with your toddler and help him/her accomplish their dreams. Life is always beautiful, just make sure you’re the one planting the flowers in the <em>garden</em>.</p><p>If you decide you want to be ambitious, understand you may fail, and once you fail. That failure will take you back to the fourth grade but keep going, you may want to find friends who are ambitious, optimistic, and driven because they will be the one who will hold you accountable and help you when you fail.&nbsp;</p><p>And if you remember anything from this essay, remember that everything and anything you do won’t matter and will be meaningless. All the hard work, all the stress, and all the worries will be meaningless. But if that is true, you optimize for doing what makes you happy, for trying to help others, and perhaps being more <strong>ambitious</strong>.</p><p>Now, I’m starving. Let’s eat the world!</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Think of ambition as 'feeding' as a small but consistent habit. Every action is a vote for who you will become and what you will achieve. This is how you build ambition.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Thanks</strong> to my friends in my dorm who inspired me to write this essay after hours of deep conversations and discussions! Thanks guys!</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1601195872853_6856"><p>If you’re into interesting ideas (like the one you just read), sign up for my<a href="https://juandavidcampolargo.com/blog/newsletter"> </a><a href="https://juandavidcampolargo.com/newsletter" target="_blank">Weekly Memos</a>, and I’ll send you new essays right when they come out.

November 20, 2020 | https://lenses.io/blog/2020/11/new-kafka-to-S3-connector/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://lenses.io/blog/2020/11/new-kafka-to-S3-connector/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Many in the community have been asking us to develop a new Kafka to S3 connector for some time. So we’re pleased to announce it's now available.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s been designed to deliver a number of benefits over existing S3 connectors:</p><ul><li><p> <!-- -->To be completely free and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/lensesio/stream-reactor/tree/master/kafka-connect-aws-s3">Open Source</a></p></li><li><p> <!-- -->To allow for optimized data storage (costs) and read-access</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->To make it simpler to manage via GitOps and introduce governance</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->To reduce need for pre-data-processing workloads</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Efficiently archive data &amp; reduce Kafka platform TCO</p></li></ul><p><span>type: <!-- -->embedded-entry-inline<!-- --> id: <!-- -->c3RRZo7RUeC79i9qUQ57ByD</span></p><p>Like our other <a href="https://lenses.io/connect/">Stream Reactors</a><u>,</u> the connector extends the standard connect config adding a parameter for a SQL command (Lenses Kafka Connect Query Language or “KCQL”). This defines how to map data from the source (in this case Kafka) to the target (S3).&nbsp;</p><p>Importantly, it also includes how data should be partitioned into S3, the bucket names and the serialization format (support includes JSON, Avro, Parquet, Text, CSV and binary).&nbsp;</p><p>The syntax looks like this:</p><pre>INSERT&nbsp;INTO&nbsp;bucketAddress:pathPrefix&nbsp;</pre><pre></pre><pre>SELECT&nbsp;*&nbsp;</pre><pre></pre><pre>FROM&nbsp;kafka-topic</pre><pre></pre><pre>[PARTITIONBY&nbsp;(partition[,&nbsp;partition]&nbsp;...)]</pre><pre></pre><pre>[STOREAS&nbsp;storage_format]</pre><pre></pre><pre>[WITHPARTITIONER&nbsp;partitioner]</pre><pre></pre><pre>[WITH_FLUSH_SIZE&nbsp;flush_size]</pre><pre></pre><pre>[WITH_FLUSH_INTERVAL&nbsp;flush_interval]</pre><pre></pre><pre>[WITH_FLUSH_COUNT&nbsp;flush_count]</pre><p>Full docs for the syntax can be found <a href="https://docs.lenses.io/4.0/integrations/connectors/stream-reactor/sinks/s3sinkconnector/">here</a>. </p><p>The connector supports a number of different authentication mechanisms to the S3 bucket including standard AWS Credentials (using an access and secret key) and via an <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html">IAM role for EC2</a>. </p><p>Where credentials are needed, the Lenses <a href="https://docs.lenses.io/4.0/integrations/connectors/secret-providers/">secret manager plugins</a> allow you to integrate with common key management solutions such as Hashicorp Vault and AWS Secret Manager.&nbsp;</p><h2>Increased control &amp; pipeline as code</h2><p>Having control over how the data is structured whilst being sinked allows you to optimize for specific use cases, workloads and read patterns by downstream applications (such as Snowflake or AWS Athena, Glue etc.) and cost. And you avoid having to build and deploy complex stream processing workloads prior to sending to S3.&nbsp;</p><p>Like all Stream Reactor and Kafka Connect connectors, the connector can be managed via your traditional deployment tools and frameworks or can be managed through Lenses. This adds a layer of RBAC, governance, auditing, error handling and monitoring to how to manage Kafka connectors.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/2ilwBPRzbKXMrVh6ZyOwOT/63686c9c5ba9486b37b32289bcfe57cb/lenses.io_aws_s3_connector_avro_to_parquet_diagram_apache_kafka__1_.png" alt="Lenses.io Apache Kafka Connector for S3 - "></p><p>The whole workload defined as Connect configuration &amp; SQL helps you manage data pipelines as configuration and over <a href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/09/kafka-gitops-with-dataops/">GitOps</a>.</p><h2>S3 sink walkthrough</h2><p>Let’s assume a scenario where we have records in a Kafka topic <code>backblaze_smart</code> related to manufacturing process failures for certain products and events need to be stored in an S3 bucket.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/XuUivdv6bjSfEHU0GcgR3/2cdac904d91918ccf9c1e95f3c833344/manufaturing_data_failure_events__1_.png" alt="manufacturing data failure events in Lenses.io "></p><p>Downstream analytics solutions (such as AWS Athena) run by different Data teams for each model need access to this data.&nbsp;</p><p>For a read-performance and cost reason, the Data team asks that messages related to each model be partitioned into different objects within the S3 bucket and with a particular naming convention and placed in a <code>manufacturing_failures</code> folder.</p><p>The KCQL we will use in our connector configuration is therefore:</p><p><code>connect.s3.kcql=INSERT&nbsp;INTO&nbsp;Manufacturing:manufacturing_failures&nbsp;SELECT&nbsp;serial_number,&nbsp;model,&nbsp;capacity_bytes,&nbsp;failure&nbsp;FROM&nbsp;backblaze_smart&nbsp;PARTITIONBY&nbsp;model&nbsp;STOREAS&nbsp;`Json`&nbsp;WITH_FLUSH_COUNT&nbsp;=&nbsp;300&nbsp;</code></p><h2>Setting the environment</h2><p>Here's a walkthrough of testing out the connector. It will involve the following processes:</p><ul><li><p> <!-- -->Creating an S3 Bucket&nbsp;</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Creating an IAM role with access to bucket</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Running the Lenses Box docker on EC2</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Configuring the connector in Lenses Box with EC2 authentication.</p></li></ul><p>The Lenses.io Box is a free all-in-one Kafka + Lenses development docker. It’s a <a href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/06/perfect-environment-learn-develop-apache-kafka/">perfect environment</a> for developing real-time applications and testing connectors and it comes with sample data.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/6RVhN71PseZkkbUiaO1PFZ/9956b3ed4a68cccbdbdaf994929c9ea8/lenses.io_box_aws_s3_connector__1_.png" alt="Lenses.io AWS S3 Connector for Kafka Connect with Lenses Box"></p><p>If you prefer to use your own Lenses or Kafka Connect environment, you can download the connector from <a href="https://lenses.io/connect/kafka-to-aws-s3/">here</a> and request a free trial of Lenses from lenses.io/start.&nbsp;</p><p>We will create an IAM role in order to configure EC2 authentication to access the S3 bucket. If you’re not running Lenses Box on an EC2 instance, this won’t be necessary but you’ll need to provide an <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-access-key/">Access and Secret key</a> to write to S3 instead.&nbsp;</p><h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>For this walkthrough, you should have the following prerequisites:</p><ul><li><p> <a target="_blank" href="https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signin?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fportal.aws.amazon.com%2Fbilling%2Fsignup%2Fresume&amp;client_id=signup">AWS account</a>.</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Access to the AWS management console with permissions to manage applications.</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->A host to run a docker container with 4GB RAM</p></li></ul><h2>Step 1: Create an S3 bucket</h2><p>1. 	Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the <a target="_blank" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3 console</a></p><p>2. 	Choose <b>Create bucket</b>.</p><p>3. 	In <b>Bucket name, </b>enter a name for your bucket &lt;BUCKETNAME&gt;. Do not use hyphens or other special characters. This is a requirement of the connector later.</p><p>4. 	Leave checked <b>Block All Public Access</b> and other settings as default.</p><p>5. 	Choose <b>Create bucket</b></p><p>Take note of your AWS region of your bucket as you’ll need this later.&nbsp;</p><h2>Step 2: Create an IAM role</h2><p>For the EC2 authentication to work, you must create an IAM role before you can launch the instance that will run Kafka Connect (the Lenses Box docker is packaged with Kafka Connect). </p><p>With the IAM role created,&nbsp; it will be attached to an instance running Kafka Connect/Box.&nbsp;</p><p>Alternatively, if you will authenticate to the S3 bucket with AWS Secret and Access keys instead, follow the processes described <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-access-key/">here</a>.</p><p><b>To create an IAM role using the IAM console</b></p><p>1. 	Open the <a target="_blank" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/">IAM console</a></p><p>2. 	In the navigation pane, choose <b>Roles</b>, <b>Create role</b>.</p><p>3. 	On the <b>Select role type</b> page, choose <b>EC2</b> and the <b>EC2</b> use case. Choose <b>Next: Permissions</b>.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/3mX85CgkwkML0OZS4niEcw/64779ac4a5879c1c483139a884490c5f/create_role_usecase__1_.png" alt="Create IAM Role S3 Lenses.io"></p><p>4. 	Choose <b>Create policy</b> to open the policy creation browser tab.</p><p>5. 	Open the JSON editor and paste the following policy, replacing the bucket name with the name of your bucket.</p><p>This policy allows access to the S3 bucket and also to the Kafka functions we will need later.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><pre>{</pre><pre></pre><pre>	"Version":&nbsp;"2012-10-17",</pre><pre></pre><pre>	"Statement":&nbsp;[</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	{</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	"Sid":&nbsp;"1",</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	"Effect":&nbsp;"Allow",</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	"Action":&nbsp;[</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	"s3:PutObject",</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	"s3:GetObject",</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	"s3:ListBucket",</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"s3:DeleteObject"</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	],</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	"Resource":&nbsp;[</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	"arn:aws:s3:::&lt;BUCKETNAME&gt;",</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	"arn:aws:s3:::&lt;BUCKETNAME&gt;/*"</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	]</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	}</pre><pre></pre><pre>	]</pre><pre></pre><pre>}</pre><p>6. 	On the <b>Review</b> page, enter a name <code>S3DataAccessPolicy</code> for the policy and choose <b>Create policy</b>.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/7Is9VgLBkFFb12JSJSxmSl/a20d1b9afc4e522501cfed492df9ebca/review_policy_s3_iam_role__1_.png" alt="IAM Role S3 Bucket Review Policy"></p><p>7.      Return to the previous browser tab for <b>Create Role</b> and refresh the policy list and find and check the newly created policy.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/3KUhlpfWhqgmmBYWnhcZiw/994dc4762ee7e5c114e1bec77d3ac57e/iam_create_role_s3__1_.png" alt="Create Policy Role S3 Bucket IAM AWS"></p><p>8. 	Choose <b>Next: Add Tags</b>.</p><p>9. 	Choose <b>Next: Review</b>.</p><p>10.&nbsp; Name the role <code>S3DataAccessRole</code> and choose <b>Create Role</b></p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/4kRvO0sop6tSuDNjVNxq7j/784c4faecc06d0338f9b71846e818189/iam_role_s3__1_.png" alt="Create S3 IAM Role for Lenses.io Kafka Connect Connector"></p><h2>Step 3: Deploy Lenses</h2><p>If you’re deploying on an EC2 instance running docker we recommend you run on a <code>t2.large</code> instance.&nbsp;</p><p>For the EC2 authentication to work, you’ll need to ensure the IAM Role associated with the instance running is assigned to the <code>S3DataAccessRole</code><b> </b>just created.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/74a5zKa3WxZJDsNT6p778k/a720a755ffb958bcbce8326d6f66e0eb/aws_console_lenses.io_s3_2.png" alt="Lenses.io Box AWS console"></p><p>Port 3030 will need to be configured in the Security Group in order to access Lenses. Depending on which other services you want to access, you may want to open up certain ports (but not essential for this walkthrough).&nbsp;</p><p>1.        Request a Box license key for free from: <a href="https://lenses.io/box/">https://lenses.io/box/</a>. You’ll receive an email with a docker run command</p><p>2.       Run the command on your EC2 instance. It should look like this: </p><p><code>docker&nbsp;run&nbsp;-e&nbsp;ADV_HOST=127.0.0.1&nbsp;\</code></p><p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-e&nbsp;EULA="https://dl.lenses.io/d/?id=REGISTER_FOR_KEY"&nbsp;\</code></p><p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--rm&nbsp;-p&nbsp;3030:3030&nbsp;-p&nbsp;9092:9092&nbsp;lensesio/box:latest</code></p><p>Note: if you want to configure your own external producers/consumers to this instance, set the <code>ADV_HOST</code> address accordingly.&nbsp; But you’ll need to ensure you open up port 9092 in the security group too.&nbsp;</p><h2>Step 4: Access Lenses and verify data</h2><p>1.	Access Lenses through your browser on port 3030.</p><p>2.	The “Explore” page acts as a real-time data catalog. Search for the <code>backblaze_smart</code> topic. This topic includes real-time flow from a sample producer within the Box environment.&nbsp;</p><p>This will be the data we sink to S3.&nbsp;</p><p>3.	To be more precise about which fields to sink to S3, from within the SQL Studio run the statement</p><p><code>SELECT&nbsp;serial_number,&nbsp;model,&nbsp;capacity_bytes,&nbsp;failure&nbsp;FROM&nbsp;backblaze_smart</code></p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/45oPl7DM6oPkghreCfvRJs/6c96121fe28619561e0ec9e9a5fc9e62/lenses.io_Sql_studio_aws_s3_connector__1_.png" alt="lenses.io Sql studio aws s3 connector"></p><h2>Step 5: Configure the S3 Connector through Lenses.io</h2><p>1.	It’s often a good idea to ensure you have access to the S3 bucket from within your environment using the AWS CLI.&nbsp;</p><p>Configure the CLI client with the command:</p><p><code>aws&nbsp;configure</code></p><p>And then at least ensure you can ls the contents of your bucket:</p><p><code>aws&nbsp;s3&nbsp;ls&nbsp;MyBucketName</code></p><p>Full instructions can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-services-s3.html">here</a>. </p><p>2.	If successfully accessing the bucket, from within Lenses, select “Connectors” from the top level menu. A number of sample connectors should already be configured in Box.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/3Rg89Ga3wxoYWuik0D9f8h/7a10b7aca70559f8853ad07bf50a7b9a/Lenses.io_box_connectors_kafka_connect__1_.png" alt="Lenses.io box connectors kafka connect"></p><p>3.	Click <b>New Connector</b>. Lenses will list all the available Connectors that are packaged by default in Box.</p><p>4.	Select the <b>S3 Connector</b></p><p>5.	Enter the details of the Connector. Take care to update the region of your S3 bucket in the parameters <code>aws.custom.endpoint</code> &amp; <code>aws.region</code>.<code>&nbsp;</code>Ensure to update the bucket name <code>MyBucketName</code> with the bucket created earlier in the <code>connect.s3.kcql</code> parameter.&nbsp;</p><pre>connector.class=io.lenses.streamreactor.connect.aws.s3.sink.S3SinkConnector</pre><pre></pre><pre>errors.retry.timeout=0</pre><pre></pre><pre>errors.log.include.messages=false</pre><pre></pre><pre>tasks.max=1</pre><pre></pre><pre>topics=backblaze_smart</pre><pre></pre><pre>errors.retry.delay.max.ms=60000</pre><pre></pre><pre>errors.deadletterqueue.context.headers.enable=false</pre><pre></pre><pre>key.converter.schemas.enable=false</pre><pre></pre><pre>connect.s3.kcql=INSERT&nbsp;INTO&nbsp;MyBucketName:manufacturing_failures&nbsp;SELECT&nbsp;serial_number,&nbsp;model,&nbsp;capacity_bytes,&nbsp;failure&nbsp;FROM&nbsp;backblaze_smart&nbsp;PARTITIONBY&nbsp;model&nbsp;STOREAS&nbsp;`Json`&nbsp;WITH_FLUSH_COUNT&nbsp;=&nbsp;3&nbsp;</pre><pre></pre><pre>aws.region=eu-west-3</pre><pre></pre><pre>errors.deadletterqueue.topic.name=s3dlq</pre><pre></pre><pre>aws.custom.endpoint=https://s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/</pre><pre></pre><pre>value.converter.schemas.enable=false</pre><pre></pre><pre>name=S3Example</pre><pre></pre><pre>errors.tolerance=none</pre><pre></pre><pre>errors.deadletterqueue.topic.replication.factor=1</pre><pre></pre><pre>aws.vhost.bucket=false</pre><pre></pre><pre>value.converter=org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter</pre><pre></pre><pre>config.action.reload=restart</pre><pre></pre><pre>errors.log.enable=true</pre><pre></pre><pre>key.converter=org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter</pre><pre></pre><pre>schemas.enable=false</pre><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/3cgpERxTROGXCNNejPwclJ/d288484fd2993178df91610577a4464d/lenses.io_aws_s3_connector_kafka_connect_configuration.png" alt="lenses.io aws s3 connector kafka connect configuration"></p><p>If you're using credentials to authenticate instead of EC2, enter a secret and access key. </p><pre>aws.secret.key=SECRET_KEY</pre><pre></pre><pre>aws.access.key=ACCESS_KEY</pre><p>6.

<p>I spent over 25 hours building a cut-down version of Sapiens. The goal? Future-me should be happy to read this once future-me forgets how we evolved. It’s massive for a blog post, just under 30 minutes, but that’s the best I could do, condensing 9 hours worth of material.</p>

<p>I’ve tried to keep editing to a minimum: It’s the original text, edited to ensure it still flows like the book.</p>

<p>What caused our brains to develop? We’re not sure.</p>

<p>It doesn’t seem likely. A larger brain needs more energy and thus reduces the chance you’ll survive. Getting more energy meant hunting more.</p>

<p>One contributing factor was the domestication of fire. Fire paved the way for cooking.</p>

<p>Whereas chimpanzees spend 5 hours a day chewing raw food, a single hour suffices for people eating cooked food. The advent of cooking enabled humans to eat more kinds of food, to devote less time to eating, and to make do with smaller teeth and shorter intestines. Some scholars believe there is a direct link between the advent of cooking, the shortening of the human intestinal track, and the growth of the human brain. Since long intestines and large brains are both massive energy consumers, it’s hard to have both. By shortening the intestines and decreasing their energy consumption, cooking inadvertently opened the way to the jumbo brains.</p>

<p>And, we weren’t alone. Competing with us were the Neanderthals, among other species. They were stronger, they had bigger brains, and they could survive the cold. How come, then, did we “win”?</p>

<p>We aren’t sure. The most likely answer is the very thing that makes the debate possible: Homo sapiens conquered the world thanks above all to its unique language.</p>

<h2 id="cognitive-revolution">Cognitive Revolution</h2>

<p>The appearance of new ways of thinking and communicating, between 70,000 and 30,000 years ago, constitutes the Cognitive Revolution. What caused it? We’re not sure. The most commonly believed theory argues that accidental genetic mutations changed the inner wiring of the brains of Sapiens, enabling them to think in unprecedented ways and to communicate using a new type of language. We might call it the Tree of Knowledge mutation.</p>

<!-- 
> All new humans are improvements over the past?
> As in, the de facto keeps rising.

>These mutated humans were praised for their initiative and were more successful
>Till everyone became like this and then even more better humans were praised and the previous became the normal -->

<p>What’s special about our language?</p>

<p>Our language is amazingly supple. We can connect a limited number of sounds and signs to produce an infinite number of sentences, each with a distinct meaning. We can thereby ingest, store and communicate a prodigious amount of information about the surrounding world. A monkey can yell to its comrades, ‘Careful! A lion!’ But a modern human can tell her friends that this morning, near the bend in the river, she saw a lion tracking a herd of bison. She can then describe the exact location, including the different paths leading to the area. With this information, the members of her band can put their heads together and discuss whether they ought to approach the river in order to chase away the lion and hunt the bison.</p>

<!-- Most likely, both the gossip theory (who can be trusted and who can't) and the there-is-a-lion-near-the-river theory are valid.  -->

<p>Yet the truly unique feature of our language is not its ability to transmit information about men and lions. Rather, it’s the ability to transmit information about things that do not exist at all. As far as we know, only Sapiens can talk about entire kinds of entities that they have never seen, touched or smelled.</p>

<!-- The alpha male usually wins his position not because he is physically stronger, but because he leads a large and stable coalition -->

<p>Using language, lots of humans could work together, form a tribe, help each other, and hunt together.</p>

<p>However, communicating with lots of people brings with it new co-ordination problems. The critical threshold for a group interacting together is 150 people.</p>

<!-- But once the threshold of 150 individuals is crossed, things can no longer work that way. You cannot run a division with thousands of soldiers the same way you run a platoon. Successful family businesses usually face a crisis when they grow larger and hire more personnel. If they cannot reinvent themselves, they go bust.  -->

<p>How did Homo sapiens manage to cross this critical threshold, eventually founding cities comprising tens of thousands of inhabitants and empires ruling hundreds of millions? The secret was probably the appearance of fiction. Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths. This is an imagined reality.</p>

<!-- Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens has thus been living in a dual reality. On the one hand, the objective reality of rivers, trees and lions; and on the other hand, the imagined reality of gods, nations and corporations.  -->

<!-- As time went by, the imagined reality became ever more powerful, so that today the very survival of rivers, trees and lions depends on the grace of imagined entities such as gods, nations and corporations. -->

<p>Unlike lying, an imagined reality is something that everyone believes in, and as long as this communal belief persists, the imagined reality exerts force in the world.</p>

<p>In other words, while the behaviour patterns of archaic humans remained fixed for tens of thousands of years, Sapiens could transform their social structures, the nature of their interpersonal relations, their economic activities and a host of other behaviours within a decade or two.</p>

<!-- > Because of the cognitive Revolution and the introduction of imagined reality -->

<p>For example, consider trade. Trade cannot exist without trust, and it is very difficult to trust strangers. The global trade network of today is based on our trust in such fictional entities as the dollar, the Federal Reserve Bank, and the totemic trademarks of corporations. When two strangers in a tribal society want to trade, they will often establish trust by appealing to a common god, mythical ancestor or totem animal.</p>

<!-- One on one, even ten on ten, we are embarrassingly similar to chimpanzees. Significant differences begin to appear only when we cross the threshold of 150 individuals, and when we reach 1,000–2,000 individuals, the differences are astounding -->

<!-- The real difference between us and chimpanzees is the mythical glue that binds together large numbers of individuals, families and groups. This glue has made us the masters of creation. -->

<p>Our Tree of Knowledge mutation was significant. However, it’s not just our biology that brought us where we are today.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Biology sets the basic parameters for the behaviour and capacities of Homo sapiens. The whole of history takes place within the bounds of this biological arena.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This arena is extraordinarily large, allowing Sapiens to play an astounding variety of games. Thanks to their ability to invent fiction, Sapiens create more and more complex games, which each generation develops and elaborates even further</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, in order to understand how Sapiens behave, we must describe the historical evolution of their actions.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<!-- Referring only to our biological constraints would be like a radio sports-caster who, attending the World Cup football championships, offers his listeners a detailed description of the playing field rather than an account of what the players are doing. -->

<!-- There is some evidence that the size of the average Sapiens brain has actually decreased since the age of foraging. Survival in that era required superb mental abilities from everyone. When agriculture and industry came along people could increasingly rely on the skills of others for survival, and new ‘niches for imbeciles’ were opened up. You could survive and pass your unremarkable genes to the next generation by working as a water carrier or an assembly-line worker. -->

<h2 id="agricultural-revolution">Agricultural Revolution</h2>

<p>The currency of evolution is neither hunger nor pain, but rather copies of DNA helixes. Just as the economic success of a company is measured only by the number of dollars in its bank account, not by the happiness of its employees, so the evolutionary success of a species is measured by the number of copies of its DNA. If no more DNA copies remain, the species is extinct, just as a company without money is bankrupt. If a species boasts many DNA copies, it is a success, and the species flourishes. From such a perspective, 1,000 copies are always better than a hundred copies. This is the essence of the Agricultural Revolution: the ability to keep more people alive under worse conditions.</p>

<p>Rather than heralding a new era of easy living, the Agricultural Revolution left farmers with lives generally more difficult and less satisfying than those of foragers. Hunter-gatherers spent their time in more stimulating and varied ways, and were less in danger of starvation and disease. The Agricultural Revolution certainly enlarged the sum total of food at the disposal of humankind, but the extra food did not translate into a better diet or more leisure. Rather, it translated into population explosions and pampered elites. The average farmer worked harder than the average forager, and got a worse diet in return. The Agricultural Revolution was history’s biggest fraud.</p>

<!-- > The average person in Jericho of 8500 BC lived a harder life than the average person in Jericho of 9500 BC or 13,000 BC. But nobody realised what was happening. Every generation continued to live like the previous generation, making only small improvements here and there in the way things were done. Paradoxically, a series of ‘improvements’, each of which was meant to make life easier, added up to a millstone around the necks of these farmers -->
<!-- 
--- Way of life being lost over generations
    Like with the foundation.
    Also short sightedness.
    As, working harder here meant more food => can better feed children => even more people exist => You're back where you started, except you're working harder.
 -->

<p>Compared to foraging, working a bit harder on the farm meant more food. Settling down on the farm also meant greater freedom to reproduce - you’re not travelling all the time, so you can afford to have more children. This in turn, meant a higher population. And a higher population meant higher food requirements. Thus, the farmers were forced to work even harder.</p>

<p>Why didn’t humans abandon farming when the plan backfired? Partly because it took generations for the small changes to accumulate and transform society and, by then, nobody remembered that they had ever lived differently. And partly because population growth burned humanity’s boats. If the adoption of ploughing increased a village’s population from a hundred to 110, which ten people would have volunteered to starve so that the others could go back to the good old times? There was no going back. The trap snapped shut.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of history’s few iron laws is that luxuries tend to become necessities and spawn new obligations</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This discrepancy between evolutionary success and individual suffering is perhaps the most important lesson we can draw from the Agricultural Revolution. When we study the narrative of plants such as wheat and maize, maybe the purely evolutionary perspective makes sense. Yet in the case of animals such as cattle, sheep and Sapiens, each with a complex world of sensations and emotions, we have to consider how evolutionary success translates into individual experience.</p>

<!-- In the following chapters we will see time and again how a dramatic increase in the collective power and ostensible success of our species went hand in hand with much individual suffering. -->

<!-- How the agricultural revolution led to individual suffering -> -->

<!-- This was a far-reaching revolution, whose impact was psychological as much as architectural. Henceforth, attachment to ‘my house’ and separation from the neighbours became the psychological hallmark of a much more self-centered creature. -->

          <p>Throughout my career, I’ve developed some <em>opinions</em>. Some have worn particularly deep ruts,
reinforced by years of experience. I tried to figure out what these
had in common, and it’s
the idea that <strong>code in production is the only code that matters</strong>. Staging doesn’t
matter, code on your laptop doesn’t matter, QA doesn’t matter,
only production matters. Everything else is debt.</p>

<p>This perspective probably comes from years sitting in between
operations and product development. I strongly
believe that teams should optimize for getting code to production as quickly as
possible as well as responding to incidents in production.</p>

<p>This idea, and a lot of the practices it implies, can be
counter-intuitive or controversial, so I want to dive into them a little
further. What follows is a set of practices and principles I believe are true,
considering my underlying belief that code working in production is the only
code that matters.</p>

<h2 id="engineers-should-operate-their-code">1. Engineers should operate their code.</h2>

<p><strong>Engineers are the subject matter experts for the code they write and should be
responsible for operating it in production</strong>. In this context, “operating” means
deploying, instrumenting, and monitoring code as well as helping to resolve
incidents related to or impacting that code. The responsibility of operating
code aligns incentives - it encourages engineers to write code that is
observable and easy to debug, and connects them to what customers really care
about. It encourages them to be curious about how their code is performing in
production. Importantly, engineers should be on-call for their code - being
on-call creates a positive feedback loop and makes it easier to know if their
efforts in writing production-ready code are paying off. I’ve heard people
complain about the prospect of being on-call, so I’ll just ask this: if you’re
not on-call for your code, who is?</p>

<p>If you’re not currently on-call for your code but want to be, and can help
influence this decision, there are some things you can do. Set up PagerDuty (or
similar) schedules for each group of engineers responsible for specific
services or parts of your code. A good schedule has 6–8 engineers. There are
plenty of variations, but a typical template is to have one-week rotations,
where you’ll be on-call for secondary for a week and then primary for a week.
Configuring alerts is a separate topic, which probably deserves it’s own blog
post entirely, but focus on things that impact your customers (see:
Symptom-based alerting) and remember that you’re ultimately responsible for how
you respond to alerts, which means you can change them.</p>

<p>There are two talks I’d recommend watching that touch on the topic of
configuring alerts: Liz Fong-Jones talks about SLOs in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4jbUzEVL0">Cultivating Production Excellence</a> and Aditya Mukerjee does a great job talking about techniques for
managing alerts in <a href="https://vimeo.com/274820572">Warning: This Talk Contains Content Known to the State of California to Reduce Alert Fatigue</a>.</p>

<h2 id="buy-almost-always-beatsbuild">2. Buy Almost Always Beats&nbsp;Build</h2>

<p><strong>If you can avoid building something, you should.</strong> Code is the most expensive
way to solve a problem that isn’t addressing a core area of your business. For
most small to mid-sized companies, there are open source or better yet, hosted
solutions that solve a wide range of common problems. I mean things like git
repository hosting (Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc), observability tooling
(Honeycomb, Lightstep, etc), managed databases (Amazon RDS, Confluent Kafka,
etc), alerting (PagerDuty, OpsGenie, etc) and a whole host of other commodity
technologies. This even applies to your infrastructure - if you can help
it, don’t roll your own Kubernetes clusters (side note: do you even need to use
Kubernetes?), don’t roll your own load balancers if you can use Amazon ELB or
ALBs.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">NIH</a> syndrome is very real and some companies get burned badly by
this. I’ve seen teams light time and money on fire reinventing components when
better, more battle-tested alternatives exist in the market. Those same teams
almost always end up spending years contending with the resulting technical
debt. If you’re on such a team and have the will and ability to impact change,
start rolling back these decisions one by one. Migrate your databases to a
managed provider, migrate your feature flagging system to a SaaS tool (i.e.
LaunchDarkly). Keep going until the only software you maintain yourselves is
the software that delivers value to your customers. You’ll be much, much better
off for it.</p>

<h2 id="make-deployseasy">3. Make Deploys&nbsp;Easy</h2>

<p>Deploying should be a frequent and unexciting activity. <strong>Engineers should be
able to deploy with minimal manual steps and it should be easy to see if the
deploy is successful</strong> (this requires instrumenting your code for observability,
which - tada - is covered above), and it should be easy to roll back a deploy
if something doesn’t go well. Deploying frequently implies that
deploys are smaller, and smaller deploys are generally easier, faster and
safer.</p>

<p>Many teams implement periods where deploys are forbidden - these can be
referred to as code freezes, or deploy policies like “Don’t deploy on Fridays”.
Having such blackout periods can lead to a pile-up of changes, which increases
the overall risk of something going very wrong.</p>

<p>If you’re on a team that fears deploys, dedicate a percentage of your
engineering time to improvements in your deployment pipeline until the fear is
gone. On a recent team I worked with, we were able to improve deploy times from
3 hours to 30 minutes, which drastically improved the teams’ confidence in the
deploy process. A natural side effect of this was that engineers started
deploying much more frequently instead of waiting for changes to pile up enough
to warrant a “release” (which was synonymous with a deploy).</p>

<p>The book
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339">Accelerate</a>
has been getting a lot of attention. If you haven’t read it, I’d recommend it.
The team behind it also publishes the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/devops/">State of DevOps</a>
reports, which are full of well-researched information about what various
companies in the industry are doing. It’s not a coincidence that two of the
four key metrics that the book focuses on are directly related to this (Deploy
Frequency, Change Lead Time). Shipping is <a href="https://www.heavybit.com/library/podcasts/o11ycast/ep-12-speed-of-deployment-with-rich-archbold-of-intercom/">your company’s heartbeat</a>.</p>

<h2 id="trust-the-people-closest-to-theknives">4. Trust the People Closest to the&nbsp;Knives</h2>

<p><strong>The people who work with a system are the ones who understand it best.</strong> This
applies to any part of the socio-technical systems within which we all work. In
the case of software systems, the engineers who deploy every day and are
on-call for critical services understand the level of risk they operate in. A
sad trend is that managers tend to overestimate their teams’ progress on
certain transitions - i.e. cloud-native, DevOps, etc. The higher up the
management chain, the larger this overestimation tends to be. Engineers who
deploy and get paged when things break know where the bodies are buried and
they know what needs the most work. They should, therefore, be the primary
stakeholders responsible for prioritizing technical work.</p>

<p>Another manifestation of this principle applies to platform or services teams.
If you’re responsible for building some shared component that’s used within
your organization (i.e. a messaging system, ci/cd infrastructure, shared
libraries or services) there’s an uncomfortable truth lurking for you: the
people who use your work know more about it than you do in many cases. They
understand implicitly how it serves customers and they know what contortions or
hoops they have to jump through to get it to work. Listen to them for
clues on how to improve the UX of your services and tools.</p>

<h2 id="qa-gates-make-qualityworse">5. QA Gates Make Quality&nbsp;Worse</h2>

<p>Many teams have a manual QA step that gets performed before deploys. The idea,
I guess, is to have someone run automated or manual tests to verify that a set
of changes are ready to be released. This sounds like a comforting
idea - having a human being (or team of human beings) “verify” a release before
it goes out - <strong>but it falls victim to several false assumptions and creates
some misalignments that do more harm than good.</strong></p>

<p>First of all, if there’s manual work that needs to be done before a deploy can
go out, that creates a bottleneck - if you’re making deploys easy, and
deploying small changes frequently, no QA team is going to be able to keep up
testing every deploy, and will inevitably block teams from deploying. That’s no
good. If you have manual tests, automate them and build them into your CI
pipeline (if they do deliver value).</p>

<p>Secondly, the teams doing QA often lack context and are under time pressure.
They may end up testing “effects” instead of “intents”. For example, I’ve seen
QA teams burn time testing that when something happens in a UI, something
related happens in a database. What happens when an engineer refactors that UI
component and changes the underlying data model? The functionality works, but
the test breaks. Because two teams are involved, this takes coordination and
time to fix. Similarly, I’ve seen QA teams block deploys because of failing
tests when caching was introduced at the CDN layer - a TTL of 5 seconds on an
activity feed may not ever be noticed by a user but it might break QA tests
causing unnecessary conflicts between product and QA engineers.</p>

<p>Luckily, solving this one is easy. Instead of having a dedicated QA team work
on creating manual and automated test cases that run in a fictitious QA
environment, reassign that team to work on continuous testing in production.
Instead of being a gate for deploys, a QA team could continuously verify that
production is working as expected. QA teams are also well situated to lead
Chaos Engineering initiatives, where faults are intentionally injected in
production. QA engineers could also work on making the CI/CD pipeline more
reliable, so that deploys are no longer a nightmare.</p>

November 20, 2020 | https://lab.ktemkin.com/post/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://lab.ktemkin.com/post/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    

    <p>I've written a bit about my look at “commercial off-the-shelf” USB3 PHY boards; and have been
taking a look recently at the <a href="https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Design-Gateway/AB07-USB3FMC?qs=5aG0NVq1C4wWGaHs8Oqcww%3D%3D">Design Gateway AB07-USBFMC module</a>. It turns out that my unit has what seems to be a pretty
embarrassing defect.</p>
<p>I've been testing my in-progress USB3 gateware with this PHY; and I've been running into an
interesting issue: periodically, some of the raw values sent were off by a single bit.</p>
<p>When training a USB3 link, one of the data sequences exchanged looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">BC BC BC BC <span>00</span> <span>00</span> 4A 4A 
4A 4A 4A 4A 4A 4A 4A 4A 
</code></pre></div><p>When using the AB07-USBFMC, trying to send this pattern resulted in the following:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">BC BC BC BC <span>00</span> <span>00</span> 0A 4A
0A 4A 0A 4A 0A 4A 0A 4A
</code></pre></div><p>This is interesting for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>This PHY has geared inputs, and accepts two bytes of data at a time.</li>
<li>The incorrect values (<code>0A</code>) are off from the correct value (<code>4A</code>) by a single bit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sure enough, modifying the data packet to send <code>FF</code> instead of <code>4A</code> pretty clearly shows off that missing bit:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">BC BC BC BC <span>00</span> <span>00</span> BF FF
BF FF BF FF BF FF BF FF
</code></pre></div><p>At this point, I assumed that I'd gotten the pinout incorrect; and that I'd been writing to the wrong pin –
but careful examination of the documentation and my FPGA I/O definitions suggested that I had things right.
This suggested it was time to check things on the physical layer.</p>
<p>The board in question looks like this:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://lab.ktemkin.com/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/board.jpg" alt="The PHY board, which features a notable long span of resistors, neatly tucked in parallel."> <figcaption>
            <h4>The AB07-USBFMC (slightly modified as detailed later).</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Notably, there's a long series of what look like termination / signal conditioning resistors present at
the PHY boundary – and it looks like there's about 32 in total; which would make sense: 16 for transmit,
and 16 for receive.</p>
<p>A quick probe verifies that these are ~50R resistors, which would make a lot of sense for series termination:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://lab.ktemkin.com/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/50r.jpg" alt="Multimeter showing a measurement of 47.5 ohms."> <figcaption>
            <h4>Sure looks like a series termination resistor.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This is excellent news, as it means that the signals are easily accessible without “voiding our warranty”,
which is a bit of a comfort when dealing with a rather expensive evaluation board.</p>
<p>So, as a next-step test, I had my FPGA squirt a 100MHz clock signal into every line on the transmit bus,
and probed the PHY side of one of those termination resistors:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://lab.ktemkin.com/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/phy_tx_healthy.png" alt="A somewhat-rounded square wave, consistent with probing a 100MHz clock."> <figcaption>
            <h4>A nice, healthy wobble. AC coupled.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The frequency and amplitude of this signal are pretty in-line with what you'd expect: the amplitude corresponds
nicely to a decently healthy logic <code>1</code>. But how does the signal look on the problematic bit?</p>
<p>I adjusted the FPGA design so it only squirted a wave into the problematic bit; and probed in line until I found it:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://lab.ktemkin.com/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/phy_tx_unhealthy.png" alt="A somewhat-rounded square wave, consistent with probing a 100MHz clock."> <figcaption>
            <h4>A *lot* less happy. Still AC couled for display.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Ut-oh. This signal's looking a lot less happy – and a lot more attenuated. At approximately 500mV peak,
you'd be hard pressed to consider this a logic <code>1</code>, even if you gave it your very best squint. There's no way
this thing would have worked in a test environment – which makes it seem very unlikely that this board was, y'know,
tested.</p>
<p>This immediately made me suspicious of the termination resistor sitting next to it; and apparently for good reason:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://lab.ktemkin.com/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/larger_50r.jpg" alt="Multimeter showing a measurement of 396.0 ohms."> <figcaption>
            <h4>Quite possibly the largest 50 Ω I've ever seen.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This resistor is quite clearly supposed to be 50 Ω. It's also quite clearly <em>not</em> 50 Ω, despite sitting cleanly
in the middle of a row of 50 Ω resistors, and pretty much definitely the source of my problems.</p>
<p>So, naturally it's time to perform what I assume must be several hundred dollars worth of rework on this $1.65k board.
Luckily, I stock E24 0402s, so I had the resistor replaced with an appropriate value in no time.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://lab.ktemkin.com/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/happier.png" alt="Oscilloscope display of a corrected waveform."> <figcaption>
            <h4>Much happier. Note the amplitude.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>With an appropriate value replaced, everything looks much happier – and everything works much more nicely.
Finally, our USB training sets look just the way they should:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://lab.ktemkin.com/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/yay.png" alt="Analyzer display showing the correct value of our training set."> <figcaption>
            <h4>A correct Training Set, at last.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I'm planning on reaching out to Design Gateway – to at least let them know that this is an issue on some boards.
I'll update this post if/when I get a reply.</p>

I also began researching different ways you can play Boggle, including all the variations sold by Hasbro, both physical and digital. I even watched old clips of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbxlB67nnmM">short-lived Boggle game show</a> from the '90s on Youtube.</p><h3 id="first-design-iteration-where-s-the-augmented-reality">First Design Iteration - Where's the Augmented Reality?</h3><p>I have designed many mobile apps over the years, but this was my first foray into augmented reality.

I was still learning the capabilities of ARKit so, initially, I didn’t spend a lot of time designing the AR experience. I played it safe and designed a simple Boggle app that listed all the possible words, provided a 3-minute timer, and gave users the ability to enter their scores after each round. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/10/i1-screens.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/i1-screens.jpg 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/i1-screens.jpg 1000w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/10/i1-screens.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>My first iteration was too light on augmented reality.</figcaption></figure><p>At this point, my designs were fulfilling Brad’s main requirement of including a computer vision component, but the app wasn’t really differentiating itself from other scorekeeping apps.

Well, I rely more on a developer to explore what’s possible and we end making decisions as we go.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>Security is an illusion, especially with computers. The systems are so complex, handled by so many different people that nobody really has a good idea of how everything works. Even the best specialists have knowledge gaps: software, hardware, etc… This creates a security nightmare: breaking stuff is trivial, fixing the systems is nearly impossible.</p>
<h2 id="high-security-systems-still-exist">High Security Systems Still Exist</h2>
<p>There are systems that are protected against nearly all attacks. <strong>Their main philosophy is not to fix the security issues but to prevent an attacker from accessing the system in the first place.</strong> You can’t hack something that’s not there. However these systems are painful to use, especially for their lack of internet connection. Here are the main techniques used in a high security system:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Air Gapping</strong>: The device can’t connect to anything that is not physically plugged into it. No internet, wifi, bluetooth, speaker, microphone, webcam. Anything that can communicate with the outside world is physically removed from the electronic device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Non Contamination Protocol</strong>: Air Gapping is not sufficient (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet">stuxnet</a> is a good example of why it isn’t). Everything plugged into the air gapped device (like usb keys) can’t be plugged anywhere else. No exceptions. This prevents any information from getting out. I would even recommend not to plug anything that comes from another device (stuff like stuxnet or ransomware can still make some damage).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Physical Protection</strong>: Non-contaminated air gapped devices are impossible to attack remotely. The only way is to access them physically. Having the electronic device hidden in a place that is difficult to access (e.g. in a safe) will protect it better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Full Disk Encryption</strong>: Physical Protection is not foolproof. An attacker can still get access to it with enough resources. To protect the information inside your device, encrypt its entire content. Not all types of encryption are made equal, we will talk about it later in this article.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tamper Evident System</strong>: The last remaining attack on an electronic device, after you’ve already used all of the above techniques, is to tamper it. The main goal is to access the encryption key when it is entered. Using tamper evident techniques (hardware and software) will alert you that somebody has modified your device to access your password (more about it in Two Layers of Encryption below).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Backup</strong>: The last remaining problem is system failure. As long as your backups follow all of the above techniques, you can have as many as you want. Store them in a different location for increased safety.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Security is more about how you use the hardware/software rather than having a secure device in itself. It’s more about protocol than technology.</strong></p>
<p>I have seen classified environment with less security than the one just presented. Using a device with all of the above techniques will guarantee an electronic fortress. However this creates a big problem: <strong>you become the information’s weak link</strong>. It means that an attacker will no longer try to hack or decrypt your device, but instead will threaten you in order to access the information inside it.</p>
<h2 id="plausible-deniability">Plausible Deniability</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.alvarez.io/img/color/2FE.png" alt="Rubber-hose cryptanalysis">
<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber-hose_cryptanalysis">Rubber-hose cryptanalysis</a> from <a href="https://xkcd.com/538/">xkcd</a></em></p>
<p>To prevent being compelled to reveal your passwords, somebody invented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption">Deniable Encryption</a>. Basically you have two passwords: when you enter the first one the information decrypted is different than when you enter the second one. You use your device with the second password to work on the sensitive information (which can’t be accessed using the first password). In case somebody threatens you, you give them the first password. They will decrypt your device and see that there is no information (or if there is, info that is not sensitive).</p>
<p>In practice Plausible Deniability is problematic:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tools and techniques exist to detect the presence of a secondary password (Deniable Encryption).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your attacker sees that the system can use plausible deniability, they may not believe that there is only one password and therefore may continue to threaten you until you reveal the second one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It will be harder for you to pass lie detection tests since you are still able to access the sensitive information using a secondary password.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What you really want, if threatened, is not to be physically able to unlock your device. If you can’t decrypt the information, nobody has a reason to threaten you.</p>
<h2 id="two-factor-encryption">Two Factor Encryption</h2>
<p>Two Factor Encryption uses your password in addition to something you possess to generate the encryption key of your device. In general these secondary factors look like USB keys. To decrypt the information, you need your password (50% of the key) and some information you don’t know, stored/calculated by your secondary factor (the other 50% of the key).</p>
<p>You can’t open your device without these two elements: your password and the secondary factor.</p>
<p>The beautiful thing is that if you break the secondary factor, you won’t be able to access your device and its backups. You can’t be compelled to decrypt the information, because you simply can’t: your password, which you can now freely communicate to your attacker, will not be enough.</p>
<p><strong>Using Two Factor Encryption creates a physical “red button” which, if pressed, will destroy all access to the information in your devices (even offline backups stored in different locations).</strong></p>
<p>This also has the side effect of preventing you from accessing your device’s information ever again. This is one disadvantage of Two Factor Encryption over Plausible Deniability, which is that you can’t access your data after the attacker is done with you. However if you’re handling sensitive information, it is very likely that you’d rather have it destroyed than letting it fall into the wrong hands.</p>
<h2 id="yubikey">YubiKey</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.alvarez.io/img/color/2FE-2.png" alt="YubiKey"></p>
<p>A nice, affordable second factor for your encryption is a <a href="https://www.yubico.com/">YubiKey</a>. However there is no straightforward manual on how to use it, and the key has quite complex modes and functionalities.</p>
<p>If you are not a technical person, I will recommend using the <a href="https://support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016614980-Understanding-Core-Static-Password-Features">password mode</a>. It is not as safe as the challenge mode, but it will be simpler to use and to configure.</p>
<p><strong>Password Mode</strong></p>
<p>The YubiKey can act as a usb keyboard. When the button is pressed, it will send a combination of keys (a kind of password) as if someone was typing. This makes it compatible with everything that requires a typed password. However using this mode implies that the 50% of the key coming from your 2FE will be the same across all devices. If it is intercepted it will drastically reduce the security.</p>
<p>To use the password mode, when prompted to your login information, enter your password (the thing you know), then plug your YubiKey and press the button. It will “type” the rest of the “password” (the thing you possess but don’t know). You can then access your device.</p>
<p>In this scenario the thing you know is 50% of the password, the other 50% of it (which you don’t know) is stored on your YubiKey and typed for you when you press the button.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge Mode</strong></p>
<p>The challenge mode is safer than the password mode, however it is more complex to configure and use. The information received from the YubiKey (the 50% of the key that comes from the 2FE) is different for each device. If it is intercepted, it will not compromise the security of other devices.</p>
<p>To use the challenge mode, your encryption software has to be compatible with it (contrary to the password mode which works with everything). When prompted to your login information, enter your password, and then the software will send a challenge (a phrase or an id you pre-configured) to the YubiKey which will respond with the missing 50% of the encryption key. The combination of the two elements (your password and the 2FE response), creating the encryption key, will unlock your device.</p>
<p>The advantage of the challenge mode is that if you configure a different challenge (phrase or id) for each device you will have a different response each time, making your encryption key unique on all your devices and backups. This increases the security a lot in case one of them is compromised.</p>
<h2 id="not-all-encryptions-are-made-equal">Not All Encryptions Are Made Equal</h2>
<p>Cryptography may be the hardest thing in security. If you screw it up, nobody will come and tell you about it, and  you will pay the consequences later on.</p>
<p><strong>Serpent Encryption Algorithm</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpent_(cipher)">Serpent</a> was part of the finalists of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard_process">AES competition</a>. It was judged to be the most secure algorithm of them all, but <a href="https://www.schneier.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/paper-twofish-final.pdf">was discarded due to its speed</a>. However 20 years later, the computational power of everything exploded. Today the difference in speed between AES and Serpent doesn’t matter anymore, however the  difference in security still does. This is part of the reason why you should use Serpent everywhere ;)</p>
<p><strong>Truecrypt</strong></p>
<p>Truecrypt is an awesome tool that has been proved to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueCrypt#Legal_cases">complicated to break</a>. The tool was suddenly discontinued in 2014 in what seemed to be due to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/26pxol/truecrypt_is_dead/">third party pressure</a>. An independent audit was financed by the <a href="https://www.opencryptoaudit.org/">community</a> in 2013. The <a href="https://opencryptoaudit.org/reports/TrueCrypt_Phase_II_NCC_OCAP_final.pdf">summary</a> was released in 2015, showing “no evidence of deliberate backdoors, or any severe design flaws that will make the software insecure in most instances”.</p>
<p>Given that it’s complicated/impossible to break, that it’s been audited without any security flaw found, and the pressure put on the developers to stop the project: <strong>it’s safe to say that you should use it everywhere</strong>.</p>
<p>You can find Truecrypt <a href="https://github.com/DrWhax/truecrypt-archive">here</a>, the last version is 7.1a. Use the 3 ciphers cascade encryption mode.</p>
<p>If you use the hidden volume feature, be careful with older backup versions of your file container. The difference between the older version of the container and the newer version will reveal the use of an hidden volume (bytes will change where there is supposedly no data). Try to backup the content of your container inside a new one, so  that there is no match at all between the backups and the original container.</p>
<p><strong>Password</strong></p>
<p>The last line of defense for your data is your password. Depending on the system you are using, the encryption key will be encrypted using your password, or …</p></div></div>

That's because the cameras in smartphones are&nbsp;unable to replicate the physical movement of an adjustable lens as seen with digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras.&nbsp;</p>  <p>This physical manipulation lens still relies on 16th century Galilean optics, an archaic system that has not been reimagined — until now. Scope CEO Holden Beggs says the new technology the team has come up with has modernized the current lens system. It&nbsp;applies electrical fields to liquid crystals enabling a high quality zoomed image without any physical movement.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"If you think about whenever you try to take a photo, especially when you want to zoom in and take a photo, when you pinch the zoom, that photo gets blurry, it gets pixilated; and it's because all your phone is essentially doing is using software that just crops the photo, it's not actually keeping that high quality," Beggs told CBC News.</p>  <p>"What our technology means is you'll be able to zoom to take consistently sharp photos, it means you'll be able to take different kinds of photos … and you can do it without having a bunch of cameras on the back of your phone, just one that can do everything."</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808073.1605800706!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/scope.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808073.1605800706!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/scope.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808073.1605800706!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/scope.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808073.1605800706!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/scope.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808073.1605800706!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/scope.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808073.1605800706!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/scope.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Scope CEO Holden Beggs says the new technology has modernized the current lens system and applies electrical fields to liquid crystals enabling a high quality zoomed image without any physical movement. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Dyson Canada Ltd.)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <h2>'Impressive invention'</h2>  <p>Explaining how the Scope lens works, Beggs said when different fields are applied, the crystals reorient and change shape, mimicking a physical zoom system — a perfect integration and replacement of current smartphone lenses.</p>  <p>"It's a great invention because it solves a problem that has really been plaguing optics and cameras," he said.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808070.1605800590!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/scope.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808070.1605800590!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/scope.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808070.1605800590!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/scope.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808070.1605800590!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/scope.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808070.1605800590!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/scope.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808070.1605800590!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/scope.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>UW’s engineering team surpassed more than 1,800 international applicants in 27 countries with their invention.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Dyson Canada Ltd.)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>The students recently won the international runner up prize and $8,500 for the James Dyson Award (JDA), a global annual design competition to encourage students to engineer inventions to some of the world's largest problems.&nbsp;</p>  <p>UW's engineering team beat out more than 1,800 international applicants in 27 countries with their invention.</p>  <p>Peter Gammack, Dyson's vice president of new product innovation, called Scope "an impressive invention" in a release.</p>  <p>"Not only is it a low compact and cost-effective solution, it also has the potential to be used in a variety&nbsp;of product applications.

November 20, 2020 | https://jslvtr.com/posts/better-python-console-apps-with-rich | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jslvtr.com/posts/better-python-console-apps-with-rich">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently I've been working on a few internal tools for my company, Teclado. Things like web scrapers to collect data and store it in a database, or simple tools to make people's jobs easier.</p>
<p>Because these are intended for a very small audience who are doing very specific tasks, I normally make console applications. And console applications can be tricky to use (and look hideous) most of the time.</p>
<p><strong>Rich</strong> is a Python library that changes that completely. My new console apps are a joy to use, look great, and it's super easy to create them.</p>
<p>In this post, let me tell you about Rich and how I've been using it. I'm not a Rich expert by any means, but I hope it helps!</p>
<h2>A Rich Example</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html">Rich documentation</a> is excellent, so I'll just give you a quick example of the sorts of things you can do with it.</p>
<pre><code><span>from</span> rich <span>import</span> <span>print</span>
<span>from</span> rich.prompt <span>import</span> Prompt

name = Prompt.ask(
    <span>"What is your name?"</span>,
    choices=[<span>"Jose"</span>, <span>"Adam"</span>, <span>"Jen"</span>]
)

helped = <span>50</span>  
print(<span>f"You have helped [bold green]<span>{helped}</span>[/] students this week! :muscle:"</span>)</code></pre>
<p>The output of this code is this:</p>
<p><img src="https://jslvtr.com/images/better-python-console-apps-with-rich/prompting.gif" alt="Terminal demo of the Prompt code"></p>
<p>Sadly, Windows support for emojis in the terminal is extremely subpar. It works well on Mac, though!</p>
<p>You can see that Rich does a lot for you already, such as limiting choices in prompts, or support for colours and styles in text using a BBCode-like syntax.</p>
<p>There's more though!</p>
<h2>Tables with Rich</h2>
<p>By far one of my favourite features of Rich is <em>Tables</em>. I'm using tables for all sorts of stuff in my console apps, and I find myself doing the same pattern over and over:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear the console</li>
<li>Add a table row</li>
<li>Draw the table</li>
</ul>
<p>With this pattern, tables can look like they're growing over time, effectively making your console window into a standalone app.</p>
<p><img src="https://jslvtr.com/images/better-python-console-apps-with-rich/tables-demo.gif" alt="Terminal demo of growing tables"></p>
<p>For example, recently I was writing a scraper for house prices nearby (I'm thinking of moving), and I naturally wanted to display the house information, price, and so forth. Nothing better than a table for this, so I got to writing:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> requests
<span>from</span> bs4 <span>import</span> BeautifulSoup
<span>from</span> rich.console <span>import</span> Console
<span>from</span> rich.table <span>import</span> Table

console = Console()
page = requests.get(RIGHTMOVE_URL).content
soup = BeautifulSoup(page)


property_table = Table()
property_table.add_column(<span>"Address"</span>, style=<span>"bold"</span>)
property_table.add_column(<span>"Rooms"</span>)
property_table.add_column(<span>"Price"</span>)

<span>for</span> property <span>in</span> properties:
    property_table.add_row(property[<span>0</span>], str(property[<span>1</span>]), str(property[<span>2</span>]))

console.print(property_table)</code></pre>
<p>That's how easy it is to draw a table using Rich! It doesn't have dynamic growing, but all you have to do to make a table grow dynamically is clear the console and re-create the table each time, with increasing numbers of rows.</p>
<p>That could be particularly useful if we had to scrape each property's page to get more information. If we did that, the table could grow as we scrape, which would be awesome!</p>
<h2>Adapting Classes to Rich</h2>
<p>Another great thing about Rich (especially if you're making applications that specifically output to a Rich <code>Console</code>), is that your classes can become <code>Renderable</code>. Then you can just print them, and Rich will display them in the format you choose.</p>
<p>For example, you could make a class like this one:</p>
<pre><code><span>from</span> rich.console <span>import</span> Console, ConsoleOptions, RenderResult
<span>from</span> rich.table <span>import</span> Table


<span><span>class</span> <span>PropertyTable</span>:</span>
    <span><span>def</span> <span>__init__</span>(<span>self</span>):</span>
        self._properties = []

    <span><span>def</span> <span>__len__</span>(<span>self</span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> len(self._properties)

    <span><span>def</span> <span>append</span>(<span>self, prop</span>):</span>
        self._properties.append(prop)

    <span><span>def</span> <span>pop</span>(<span>self</span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> self._properties.pop()

    <span><span>def</span> <span>clear</span>(<span>self</span>):</span>
        self._properties.clear()

    <span><span>def</span> <span>__rich_console__</span>(<span>self, console: Console, options: ConsoleOptions</span>) -&gt; RenderResult:</span>
        properties = Table(expand=<span>True</span>)
        properties.add_column(<span>"Address"</span>)
        properties.add_column(<span>"Rooms"</span>, style=<span>"bold"</span>)
        properties.add_column(<span>"Price"</span>, style=<span>"bold green"</span>)

        <span>for</span> prop <span>in</span> self._properties:
            prop.add_row(prop[<span>0</span>], str(prop[<span>1</span>]), str(prop[<span>2</span>]))

        <span>yield</span> properties</code></pre>
<p>And when printed using a Rich <code>Console</code>, that shows a table with a row per item in the <code>_properties</code> list.</p>
<h2>Better Logging and Tracebacks with Rich</h2>
<p>Rich can do many other things for you, but another good one is that it can make it easier to read tracebacks and errors. Just do this:</p>
<pre><code><span>from</span> rich.traceback <span>import</span> install
install()</code></pre>
<p>And from then on, your tracebacks will look like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/raw/master/imgs/traceback.png" alt="Screenshot of Rich tracebacks"></p>
<p>Image taken directly from the <a href="https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich">Rich GitHub page</a> (which by the way, is great).</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you make console apps, as most of us Python developers do, I really recommend installing and using Rich! It'll make your apps easier to code and use.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading!</p>

<h4>About Nir Eyal</h4>



<p>Nir Eyal is an Israeli-born American author, lecturer, and investor.  Previously, he taught as a Lecturer in Marketing at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and Design School and I’ve sold two technology companies since 2003. </p>



<p>Nir Eyal is the bestselling author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591847788/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=motiveex-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1591847788&amp;linkId=efb3c5480d3cd5d001553869edce302c"><em>Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products</em></a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/194883653X/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=motiveex-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=194883653X&amp;linkId=4e87049bcf3c51d2ef9828baac46fd9b"><em>Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life</em></a>. </p>



<p>Years of studying successful startups led to insights about influencing consumer behavior. And then, these insights were codified in the Hook model: a cycle of events, engineered to keep users coming back. </p>



<p> Hooked is ideal for businesses that build products that require ongoing, unprompted user engagement, and therefore need to build user habits within the product to thrive. It is a perfect read for startup founders, visionaries, innovators, but also established corporations who aim to understand how products influence our behavior and use habits for good.

<h4>Nir Eyal Quotes</h4>



<p>Here are the most powerful success lessons from the Nir Eyal quotes:</p>



<blockquote><p>Users who continually find value in a product are more likely to tell their friends about it.</p><cite><strong> Nir Eyal </strong></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Many innovations fail because consumers irrationally overvalue the old while companies irrationally overvalue the new.</p><cite><strong> Nir Eyal </strong></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Products that require a high degree of behavior change are doomed to fail.</p><cite> <strong> Nir Eyal </strong> </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>To change behavior, products must ensure the user feels in control. People must want to use the service, not feel they have to.</p><cite> <strong> Nir Eyal </strong> </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>The Hook Model is designed to connect the user’s problem with the designer’s solution frequently enough to form a habit. It is a framework for building products that solve user needs through long-term engagement.</p><cite> <strong> Nir Eyal </strong> </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Make your product so simple that users already know how to use it, and you’ve got a winner.</p><cite> <strong> Nir Eyal </strong> </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Companies who form strong user habits enjoy several benefits to their bottom line.</p><cite> <strong> Nir Eyal </strong> </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>the first place for the entrepreneur or designer to look for new opportunities is in the mirror.</p><cite><strong>Nir Eyal </strong> </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Fun is looking for the variability in something other people don’t notice. It’s breaking through the boredom and monotony to discover its hidden beauty.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>For some businesses, forming habits is a critical component to success, but not every business requires habitual user engagement.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Instead of relying on expensive marketing, habit-forming companies link their services to the users’ daily routines and emotions.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>When users start to automatically cue their next behavior, the new habit becomes part of their everyday routine.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>The ultimate goal of a habit-forming product is to solve the user’s pain by creating an association so that the user identifies the company’s product or service as the source of relief.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>there are three ingredients required to initiate any and all behaviors: (1) the user must have sufficient motivation; (2) the user must have the ability to complete the desired action; and (3) a trigger must be present to activate the behavior.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>“Habit Testing.” It is a process inspired by the build-measure-learn methodology championed by the lean startup movement. Habit Testing offers insights and actionable data to inform the design of habit-forming products. It helps clarify who your devotees are, what parts of your product are habit-forming (if any), and why those aspects of your product are changing user behavior.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Internet is, “a giant machine designed to give people what they want.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Habit-forming products often start as nice-to-haves (vitamins) but once the habit is formed, they become must-haves (painkillers).</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>For an infrequent action to become a habit, the user must perceive a high degree of utility, either from gaining pleasure or avoiding pain. </p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>So why haven’t more Google users switched to Bing? Habits keep users loyal. If a user is familiar with the Google interface, switching to Bing requires cognitive effort. Although many aspects of Bing are similar to Google, even a slight change in pixel placement forces the would-be user to learn a new way of interacting with the site. Adapting to the differences in the Bing interface is what actually slows down regular Google users and makes Bing feel inferior, not the technology itself.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>We often think the Internet enables you to do new things … But people just want to do the same things they’ve always done.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Users take their technologies with them to bed.[cxiv] When they wake up, they check for notifications, tweets, and updates, sometimes even before saying “Good morning” to their loved ones.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Once a technology has created an association in users’ minds that the product is the solution of choice, they return on their own, no longer needing prompts from external triggers.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Variable rewards are one of the most powerful tools companies implement to hook users</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<pre></pre>



<blockquote><p>You are now equipped to use the Hook Model to ask yourself these five fundamental questions for building effective hooks:   1.   What do users really want? What pain is your product relieving? (Internal Trigger) 2.   What brings users to your service? (External Trigger) 3.   What is the simplest action users take in anticipation of reward, and how can you simplify your product to make this action easier? (Action) 4.   Are users fulfilled by the reward, yet left wanting more? (Variable Reward) 5.   What “bit of work” do users invest in your product? Does it load the next trigger and store value to improve the product with use? (Investment)</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Who is on a team matters less than how the team members interact, structure their work, and view their contributions.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>To receive fewer emails, we must send fewer emails.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>There are many counterintuitive and surprising ways companies can boost users’ motivation or increase their ability by understanding heuristics—the mental shortcuts we take to make decisions and form opinions.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>If you were to walk around Slack’s company headquarters in San Francisco, you’d notice a peculiar slogan on the hallway walls. White letters on a bright pink background blare, “Work hard and go home.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>The goal is to eliminate all white space on your calendar so you’re left with a template for how you intend to spend your time each day.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Motivation or Ability — Which Should You Increase First? After uncovering the triggers that prompt user actions and deciding which actions you want to turn into habits, you can increase motivation and ability to spark the likelihood of your users taking a desired behavior. But which should you invest in first, motivation or ability? Where is your time and <a href="https://motiveex.com/tag/wealth/">money</a> better spent? The answer is always to start with ability.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Building habit-forming products is an iterative process and requires user behavior analysis and continuous experimentation.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>However, products utilizing infinite variability stand a better chance of holding on to users’ attention, while those with finite variability must constantly reinvent themselves just to keep pace.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Many entrepreneurs fall into the trap of building products that are only marginally better than existing solutions, hoping their innovation will be good enough to woo customers away from existing products. But when it comes to shaking consumers’ old habits, these naive entrepreneurs often find that better products don’t always win—especially if a large number of users have already adopted a competing product.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Companies fail to change user behaviors because they do not make their services enjoyable for its own sake, often asking users to learn new, unfamiliar actions instead of making old routines easier.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>

                    <h2 id="a-week-in-summary-hype-value-hyper-hype-vs-hyper-growth">A week in summary: Hype = Value? Hyper hype VS Hyper growth</h2><p><br>A bit of market frenzy this week and US election conspiracy with the timing of Pfizer and BioNTech announcement of a COVID-19 vaccine. A vaccine that could bank them <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/10/pfizer-and-biontech-could-make-13bn-from-coronavirus-vaccine">$13 billion next year</a> and speed of development. The FTSE 100 jumped by 5% whilst Zoom (-15%), Peloton (-7%) and Netflix (-5%) fell. Perhaps more people would still prefer to go back to their Friday night drinks and in-person gym experiences over online <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21559541/beyonce-peloton-themed-class-music-bike-treadmill-lawsuit-settled">Beyonce X Peloton classes</a>.<br></p><div><p><strong>Hyper hype hype</strong></p><p>On the other side of the market, Supreme was acquired this week for $2.1 billion by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/09/vans-owner-vf-corp-to-buy-streetwear-brand-supreme-for-2point1-billion.html">VF Corp</a>. This brings them into the fold of a company who owns Timberland, The North Face and Vans. They are <a href="https://trapital.co/2020/11/10/memo-014-hip-hops-next-era">a firm with experience</a> in extending the shelf of mass market brands but it is to be seen whether Supreme’s brand will extend well into the mass market. Whilst resale prices may be high for Supreme products on the secondary market, going to the masses can be profitable. Last year when Yeezy began to go to the mass market they saw a <a href="https://footwearnews.com/2019/business/athletic-outdoor/yeezy-mass-release-sales-2019-1202736706/">500% increase in sales</a> and also a $1.3 billion deal with GAP this year. </p></div><div><p>The market continued as a hypebeast continued this week with viral digital products studio MSCHF claiming to raise a seed round of $200 million for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/mschfs-push-party-raises-an-unconventional-round-at-a-200-million-valuation">PushParty</a>, an app with a FOCUS on doing one thing only. If you press the big red button on the app, you send a notification to everyone with the app installed. Perhaps being a hypebeast can be quite a lucrative career option. MSCHF previously raised $11.5 million and who can forget, Push Pizza, the equally minimalist startup that lets you do only one thing - <a href="https://insights.dice.com/2014/08/08/push-for-pizza-app/">push a button for pizza</a>.</p></div><figure><img src="https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/XQpNChZzd_phLLy_NgqZNTeyAt7_6ZsK76jKtw5-C4qAcFz2BEMKI2E0zSZVAYoltjqrikDrFui0Ov2Q1OV1HpKeyVYSC_DXfO7oCrHrmIpfUghel-kHqpd3MnMGVOIqxOBWRZ7s2jUB8fpcwKU7_SSgP7mREA=s0-d-e1-ft#https://mcusercontent.com/9c9bf2101972b0a405bd2f81d/images/b40917ab-e8ff-4e6e-8699-aeaf753e0f0d.png" alt=""></figure><div><p><strong>Hyper growth</strong></p><p>Whilst Supreme and MSCHF command the attention of Gen-Z, UK startup Hopin has been facing super <em>hypergrowth</em>. The startup has raised $125 million in a Series B since raising $40 million in a Series A only a few months ago in the summer. Hopin is now at a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/hopin-raises-125m-for-its-online-events-platform-on-the-back-of-surging-growth/">$2.25 billion valuation</a> whilst having $20million Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR). The startup is only 2 years old. Solo founder Johnny Boufarhat created the startup from a desire to improve the events networking business after falling seriously ill after a food poisoning experience. Johnny shares <a href="https://viralwegrow.com/blog/hopin-johnny-boufarhat/">some of his insights</a> on how he has managed to raise capital as a solo founder and how to manage viral growth.</p></div><p>Hopin’s valuation at 100x its current ARR display some of the investor optimism in having a ‘really good’ <em>product market fit </em>for Software as a Service (SaaS) businesses and an extreme outlier. As a benchmark, slower growing SaaS companies trade at 3-5x next year’s revenue (e.g. Zuora and Dropbox) whilst fast growing ones (and outliers) like Zoom and Datago trade at a valuation that is 40x the ARR.<br></p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/uI1EZt26p1urFsssrQWvx2UUvFfxgnuQVL9Lae5dJqTsfUuVoY00a0GbXvLNW_QBJS57zoc6mtft0-ZzqEeBwdhJ0lv-fLq8GCW5isAW_ObudP5LeVxik8g-godRRmgUWOGMO9Gh" alt=""><figcaption>Growth premium in SaaS. <em>Source: SeriouslySaaS</em></figcaption></figure><div><p><strong>Product to Market Hype - Veblen Goods</strong></p><p>What we are seeing in the market with hype products is a phenomenon called a Veblen good. What this means is that unlike consumer interest for traditional goods which falls as price increases, increasing the price for a Veblen product creates an exclusive ‘luxury’ effect that increases demand. In the case of Supreme, there’s a perceived value in the hype for a good whether it be resale values or to own something exclusive. How this works for content or digital media which is less scarce and more infinitely scalable is less certain (although <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/tokenized-art-nfts-paint-bright-future-for-artists-blockchain-tech">blockchain firms are trying for digital art</a>). MSCHF is a media based company and it is working for them. </p></div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/HFJUMKT8iR-7zDYzXYa0GeAJmTQNwmiPqIYWeNyFXyLcq6LxariReqhP6uynZNKo3dWthnaaDgqwouQu6wjfbEMYkcg7sxHUl9t8wr1V6O_IFg2sbyn6kulBmfErKZJEmhSRvhDv" alt=""><figcaption>Normal Good vs Veblen Good</figcaption></figure><div><p>Perhaps this hype is part of a wider cultural shift of spending patterns. According to Future Cast, Gen Z’s have an <a href="https://www.millennialmarketing.com/research-paper/the-power-of-gen-z-influence/">enormous influence on spend</a>. They spend $44 billion for themselves and influence $600 billion in spending by others. It is well documented that both Gen Z’s and Millenials have a greater weighting on value in paying for <em>experiences</em>. Perhaps being a part of a meme or consuming <em>content as an experience </em>is worth hyping and paying for. </p></div><h2 id="brain-gems">Brain Gems<br></h2><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/08/business/digital-nomads-regret.html"><strong>The Digital Nomads Did Not Prepare for This</strong></a> (by Erin Griffith)</p><p>Paradise lost.

<p>Drupal, a popular CMS and blogging platform has patched a remote code execution vulnerability, <strong>CVE-2020-13671</strong>.</p>



<p>Today, over half a million sites use Drupal, as such applying updates for critical vulnerabilities like these immediately is vital.</p>



<p>The vulnerability also tracked as <a href="https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2020-012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SA-CORE-2020-012</a>, exists due to improper validation of filenames of files uploaded to Drupal websites.</p>



<p>A remote attacker can upload files with crafted filenames. Since the vulnerable versions do not properly sanitize these filenames, it is possible to trick the uploader into treating a file as, say, PHP, and have it execute arbitrary code on the server. </p>



<p>“Drupal core does not properly sanitize certain filenames on uploaded files, which can lead to files being interpreted as the incorrect extension and served as the wrong MIME type or executed as PHP for certain hosting configurations,” states Drupal’s security advisory.</p>



<h2>Multiple patched versions released</h2>



<p>Drupal has released patches for multiple versions, depending on what branch you are using:</p>



<ul><li>If you are using Drupal 9.0, update to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/9.0.8">Drupal 9.0.8</a></li><li>If you are using Drupal 8.9, update to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.9.9">Drupal 8.9.9</a></li><li>If you are using Drupal 8.8 or earlier, update to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.8.11">Drupal 8.8.11</a></li><li>If you are using Drupal 7, update to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/7.74">Drupal 7.74</a></li></ul>



<p>“Versions of Drupal 8 prior to 8.8.x are end-of-life and do not receive security coverage,” states the advisory.</p>



<p>In addition, for due diligence, website admins should check <em>all previously uploaded files</em> for malicious extensions. </p>



<p>The security advisory suggests looking for files with more than one extension, such as <code>filename.php.txt</code> or <code>filename.html.gif</code>.</p>



<p>These files are really PHP or HTML files containing code but have been disguised as text/image files via a misleading file extension.</p>



<p>“Look specifically for files that include more than one extension, like&nbsp;<code>filename.php.txt</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>filename.html.gif</code>, without an underscore (<code>_</code>) in the extension. Pay specific attention to the following file extensions, which should be considered dangerous even when followed by one or more additional extensions:”</p>



<ul><li>phar</li><li>php</li><li>pl</li><li>py</li><li>cgi</li><li>asp</li><li>js</li><li>html</li><li>htm</li><li>phtml</li></ul>



<p>“This list is not exhaustive, so evaluate security concerns for other unmunged extensions on a case-by-case basis.”</p>



<p>Multiple researchers have been credited for reporting this vulnerability: ufku, Mark Ferree, Frédéric G. Marand, Samuel Mortenson of the Drupal Security Team, and Derek Wright.</p>



<p>Users are advised to upgrade their Drupal instances to the fixed versions as soon as possible. Also, remember to perform additional auditing steps mentioned above to minimize the possibility of a potential security compromise.</p>

PCI DSS is a crucial information security standard that protects the data of branded credit card holders and allows them to make safe and secure transactions on online portals. </p><p>According to <a href="https://www.websiteplanet.com/blog/prestige-soft-breach-report/">websiteplanet.com</a>, Prestige Software was not following this standard, which resulted in the ability to accept and process credit card statements to become subdued. The resulting data breach effortlessly sourced all sensitive information leading to millions of customers exposed on the Internet. The effects of this data breach will be felt by the company directly in terms of negative press coverage, loss of business, and legal action. They will also have to face heavy fines due to GDPR and Data Privacy Violations.</p><p>This data breach doesnâ€™t just affect customers and the company itself but also exposes its clients, including big names such as Expedia, Booking.com, Agoda, Sabre, Omnibees, and more. Whatâ€™s more concerning is that while investigations were ongoing regarding the data breach, new customer records were still being accepted, recorded, and uploaded on the platform.</p></div></section></div>]]>

<p>I think DevOps, as we understand it today, is coming to an end. At least the Ops part of it. As cloud infrastructure becomes a key application concern, more and more ops tasks are done by the cloud itself or built into the application. What’s left is the provisioning and management of the infrastructure needed by the application. This comes with all the baggage associated, like security and networking, for example.</p>
<p>All of these patterns that are now being forged will make the infrastructure provisioning indistinguishable from the application itself for the general use case. Right now, in most companies, traditional IT Groups have rebranded themselves as DevOps and are now the gatekeepers of AWS, instead of the on-premise VMWare clusters. They use Terraform instead of bash scripts and are generally more agile, having adopted many of the development practices. These are specialized people that are familiar with networking, with how IAM works in AWS. They are responsible for building the networking part, the infrastructure, securing it, and handing it over to the application that uses them.</p>
<p>The developers are mostly fine with it, as they don’t want to learn the intricacies of AWS IAM or VPC’s. I’m reminded in many ways of how the database was treated when I joined the industry in the 2000s. Back then, the application would not touch the structure of the database. You would have scripts that would be run by DBAs on production systems. Those would create the database structure, the tables, indexes, and basically the entire database structure. Developers would then map these to their code and just perform DML once the application was running on a fixed schema that is managed by someone else. I see infrastructure the same way today.</p>
<p>Once ORM and various other frameworks started to manage this domain, these concerns got bundled in the application. There is no reason why the same thing won’t happen to infrastructure. The only problem is we didn’t have the right frameworks to do it, but now we’re starting to get them.</p>
<p>The need to handle application infrastructure (I see this different than managing core business services infrastructure like AD, email, finance systems, etc.) at scale happened in the age of virtualization and started with CFEngine. For those that don’t know, CFEngine was one of the first configuration management systems as we understand it today, followed by Puppet, Chef, and others. CFEngine happened in the age where most provisioned happened either by hand or by following documented step by step instructions. At the core of the proposition was a whitepaper written by Mark Burgess <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. The mainline of reasoning was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Present day computer systems are fragile and unreliable. Human beings are involved in the care and repair of computer systems at every stage in their operation. This level of human involvement will be impossible to maintain in the future. Biological and social systems of comparable and greater complexity have self-healing processes that are crucial to their survival. It will be necessary to mimic such systems if our future computer systems are to prosper in a complex and hostile environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CFEngine was one of the first cracks of the problem of building a self-healing system that works at scale and shares some of the ideas from the immune system. To achieve this, it leveraged four important properties:
1) It used a DSL to describe the desired state instead of using procedural languages. This would try to abstract components to allow administrators to parameterize and reuse.
2) It has converging semantics, i.e., one describes what a system should look like, and when the system has been brought to that state, CFEngine becomes inert.
4) It offers protection against an unfortunate repetition of tasks and hanging processes in situations where several administrators are working independently with little opportunity to communicate.</p>
<p>Using these features, one could achieve a self-correcting and self-healing system, which would result in a system that maintains fault tolerance. Today with AWS, we can design a system that displays the same properties by leveraging multi-regional services. By their nature, these services can transfer these properties to the application if employed with careful design.</p>
<p>Lots of other tools appeared around the same time or soon after, each focusing on different aspects of the initial value proposition. Probably the most popular are Puppet and Chef. Each has its strong points. At the company I work, we went with Puppet to handle our infrastructure configuration mostly because it was easier to read for non-programers. From a sysadmin perspective, it was appealing to get something done without diving too much into coding. In time, it would prove to be a false choice that would hurt us more than it helped.</p>
<p>Puppet has its own DSL, its own terminology, and idiosyncrasies. It has its own ecosystem of tools, dashboards, and extensions that help you get pretty far in managing your infrastructure. Its strong point is dealing with single server systems that didn’t need distributed coordination between them. There is a way of coordination across several servers with exported resources and PuppetDB, but it always felt hacky to me((it may be a different story today, but I haven’t followed the space for a couple of years now).</p>
<pre><code>
#https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-minecraft/blob/master/manifests/user.pp

class minecraft::user {
  group { $minecraft::group:
    ensure =&gt; present,
    system =&gt; true,
  }

  user { $minecraft::user:
    ensure     =&gt; present,
    gid        =&gt; $minecraft::group,
    home       =&gt; $minecraft::install_dir,
    managehome =&gt; true,
    system     =&gt; true,
    require    =&gt; Group[$minecraft::group],
  }

  # Ensures deletion of install_dir does not break module, setup for plugins
  $dirs = [$minecraft::install_dir, "${minecraft::install_dir}/plugins"]

  file { $dirs:
    ensure  =&gt; directory,
    owner   =&gt; $minecraft::user,
    group   =&gt; $minecraft::group,
    require =&gt; User[$minecraft::user],
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This worked well and allowed us to build a lot of automation to manage hundreds of servers when dealing with simple infrastructure components. But like most things, it’s the edge cases that make you feel the pain. Since the Puppet language is a DSL, simple problems started to become big problems. Like, not being able to do a proper for-loop. Or doing string manipulation.</p>
<p>Most configuration languages suffer from these problems. In the end, you will also probably get in a situation where you need to extend them to cover a specific use case, and usually, it’s at this point that you will need to write real code. There is only so much you can do without writing in “real” languages, so we should have probably done it from the start. Looking back, probably Chef would have been a much better choice. At least with it, a lot of the things learned there could have been applied to other aspects of my career (Chef uses ruby instead of their own DSL). I don’t have a lot of experience with Ansible or with Salt, but I feel they suffer from the same shortcomings and have similar strong points.</p>
<p>A somewhat distinct category in the configuration language space is Terraform and AWS Cloud Formation. They both borrow from the legacy of configuration management systems and try to sync their internal view of how things should look with reality. The main difference, outside of the way you express intent (which is still using DSL and not full fledge languages), is that they’re designed to work at the cloud provider level.</p>
<p>Just as Puppet and Chef are very good at managing typical resources on a machine (service, package, config file), Terraform and AWS Cloud Formation are very good at managing cloud services. They were built with the notion of cloud infrastructure. This doesn’t mean that you can’t do the same thing with Puppet, Chef, and the rest of the gen2 configuration languages. You can, but due to how fast they adapted to the cloud reality, how they tried to monetize the cloud, and so on, Terraform became the uncontested king of DSL based cloud infrastructure management, while Cloud Formation reigned in AWS land.</p>
<p>All these tools adopted the best parts from CFEngine, the most important being the notion of convergent state. They would take your expressed intent, compare it to the machine, figure out any dependencies and order of steps that will bring the resources to its desired state. They usually also involve a compilation stage where they map the DSL to inner logic and create an execution plan. This would also catch basic mistakes. These are good ideas that have battle-proven and are now the default way of dealing with infrastructure.</p>
<p>As we move forward, however, fundamental shifts are happening in the way we consume and deal with infrastructure components. Now you can leverage AWS services. You can build a very complex application that uses CloudFront for static content distribution, API gateway with Lambda to build API routes and add business functionality to them. Identity management can be handled by Cognito. On the backend, these Lambda functions can interact with an entire ecosystem of infrastructure directly, like RDS or DynamoDB. You can interact with analytics systems via Redshift or display visualized data via QuickSight. Background tasks can be handled by Lambda as well, workflows driven with step functions, async batch, and ETL tasks using AWS EMR or Glue. Composing these to achieve significant business value can be done with relatively little glue code as AWS services are very well integrated together.</p>
<p>New classes of applications are emerging that try to better adapt to this landscape. One example is what AWS labeled as serverless. Provisioning these types of apps using Terraform or Cloud Formation can lead to a lot of friction. In such a tightly integrated model, your infrastructure will evolve with your application, so this probably needs to be one of the most …</p></div></div>

<p>I had a fun little experience over the past few days. Someone had ordered Domino’s in the UK and seemingly typed in my email address by accident. This gave me the privilege of receiving daily emails from Domino’s promoting their latest deal. The first few days it was novel and interesting seeing what was popular across the pond but this morning I decided I might as well unsubscribe.</p>

<amp-img src="/assets/static/images/dominos-pre-vpn.png" alt="Domino's marketing page without VPN" width="1297" height="185" layout="responsive"></amp-img>

<p>Lo and behold the unsubscribe link didn’t work. Rather than a web page I got a friendly server error indicating “Access Denied” and that I did not have permission to access the unsubscribe page. My suspicion that this was a result of Domino’s blocking access to the site turned out to be true since I was able to unsubscribe using a VPN.</p>

<p>What a wild world. Rather than supporting a global unsubscribe Domino’s has a geofenced site for the UK that just blocks access outside the country (just try going to https://www.dominos.co.uk/ outside the UK). I don’t know what sort of anti-spam laws this violates (am I now <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business">$43,280</a> richer?) but it’s ridiculous that I was not able to unsubscribe from Domino’s email without resorting to a VPN.</p>

<p>The lesson here is that if you live outside the Uk and want to bother someone - sign them up for an account on the Domino’s UK site.</p>

								<div>
									<ul>
<li><span>“In the nineteen-nineties, the spread of e-mail had transformed knowledge work. With nearly all friction removed from professional communication, anyone could bother anyone else at any time.” — Cal Newport</span></li>
<li><span>Cal references David Allen and his book “</span><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1633.Getting_Things_Done?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=QHFss5ZqVH&amp;rank=1"><span>Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity</span></a><span>,” where David talks about a theory on how our minds work that suggests when we try to keep track of obligations in our heads, we create “open loops” that make us anxious.&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li><span>“If we could avoid worrying about what we were supposed to be doing, we could focus more fully on what we were actually doing, achieving what Allen called a “mind like water.” — Cal Newport</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>Cal also notes the late Peter Drucker (who wrote over 39 books) with how predicted in the mid 1950s how work/productivity would change in the future. “Drucker predicted that corporate profits would depend on mental effort, and that each individual knowledge worker, possessing skills too specialized to be broken down into “repetitive, simple, mechanical motions” choreographed from above, would need to decide how to “apply his knowledge as a professional” and monitor his own productivity.”</span></li>
<li><span>It’s important to not attach your identity to your productivity. Or as Cal mentions, “Productivity, we must recognize, can never be entirely personal. It must be connected to a system that we can study, analyze, and improve.”</span></li>
<li><span>Your days should be structured in such a way that you can spend most of your time focussed on the autonomous, creative, skilled work that Drucker identified as so crucial to growing our economy, Cal adds.</span></li>
<li><span>For teams/companies, Cal asks such a simple question and solution that I think gets glossed over sometimes and especially now that we’re all mostly remote. “What if you began each morning with a status meeting in which your team confronts its task board? A plan could then be made about which handful of things each person would tackle that day. Instead of individuals feeling besieged and resentful—about the additional tasks that similarly overwhelmed colleagues are flinging their way—they could execute a collaborative plan designed to benefit everyone.”</span></li>
</ul>
								</div>
								<p><img src="https://gradually.co/wp-content/themes/gradually/img/two-cents.png">
								</p><!-- end half sqaure arrow -->
								<p><span>I’ve always felt that my productivity has never been top-notch-allstar-level quality. However, my only comparison is my perceived productivity of other people. Those same people, I have no clue whether or not they are struggling just as much as me or if they have a team of help. Productivity is such a weird, but cool space. The humanness of it is very real. </span></p>

      Posted on January 27, 2017
      
          by Kwang Yul Seo
      
  </p>
  

<p>Happy lunar new year! Today I would like to share my experience of learning Haskell. It’s been a really long journey but a really wonderful one.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>Back in 2000, I was an undergraduate student majoring in computer science. At that time, I was into system programming and enjoyed learning low-level implementation details of operating systems and system applications. My primary language was C and programmed all programming assignments in C. I was proud that I understood how my code was compiled and executed on the machine.</p>
<p>One day my friend told me about <em>Haskell</em>. I wasn’t interested in functional programming at that time, but I became curious because he enthusiastically persuaded me to learn Haskell. I ended up reading two books on Haskell.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.haskellcraft.com/craft3e/Home.html">Haskell: the Craft of Functional Programming</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/hudak/SOE/">The Haskell School of Expression</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Both books were really nice and I learned I could program in an entirely different way. However, I wasn’t sure if Haskell could solve the real-world problems I wanted to solve. So my interest in Haskell stopped there.</p>

<p>My first job was mainly about porting and optimizing Java Virtual Machine for embedded systems. My company licensed Sun’s CDC JVM and I was responsible for maintaining it.</p>
<p>It was 2002 and Linux was still a luxury for embedded systems. RTOSes such as pSOS and VxWorks were popular on STBs and I ported JVM to these OSes. These RTOSes didn’t have distinctions between kernel and user space and an application was linked statically with the kernel and ran as a single (kernel) process application on the device.</p>
<p>The implication was profound. I had no safety guarantee provided by modern operating systems. A bug in an application could corrupt the kernel data and crash the entire system. Moreover, because there were dozens of threads competing for shared resources, race conditions and dead locks were a common place. It took hours or even days to find and fix a trivial bug.</p>
<p>The situation was much better when debugging an application written in Java. Thanks to the safety guarantee of Java, certain types of bugs were impossible. A Java program can’t corrupt memory and crash the system. Dead locks are reported systematically by the JVM. It was relatively fun to fix a bug in Java applications.</p>
<p>These experiences motivated me to find systematic ways of preventing bugs and led me to read Benjamin C. Pierce’s <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/">Types and Programming Languages</a>. It was the best computer science text book I’ve ever read. I understood why types were important in statically typed functional languages like Haskell! If universities had used this book as a undergraduate PL textbook, many of the confusions and misunderstandings about dynamic vs static typing would have disappeared.</p>

<p>By fully understanding the merits of type systems, I started to learn Haskell in a different perspective. I read <a href="https://www.haskell.org/tutorial/index.html">A Gentle Introduction To Haskell</a> and many tutorials on monads. It wasn’t very hard to understand specific instances of monads such as <em>Reader</em>, <em>Writer</em>, <em>State</em>, <em>List</em> and <em>Maybe</em>. But I couldn’t figure out how they were related. I managed to write simple applications in Haskell, but wasn’t confident that I could use Haskell productively because I couldn’t fully understand one of the core ideas of Haskell.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I changed my career and founded a tech start-up in 2008. I built mobile web browsers for the embedded systems. I created a port of <a href="https://webkit.org/">WebKit</a> and hacked various components of WebKit to speed up the performance. The primary means for optimization was to leverage the multi-core CPU and GPU.</p>
<p>WebKit performs lots of tasks concurrently but it is mostly single-threaded. Loading a page does not benefit much from having a multi-core CPU. So I offloaded some tasks to separate threads but I only gained marginal performance benefits in exchange for largely increased complexity. I learned a lesson that I must pay very high costs of complexity to get small benefits of performance boost. Considering the already complex nature of WebKit, I ended up abandoning most of performance optimizations to keep the complexity under control.</p>
<p>While struggling to squeeze performance out of WebKit, I learned Haskell again to get some insights on parallel programming because Haskell was the only programming language which natively supported <em>STM(Software Transaction Memory)</em>. Simon Marlow’s <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000929/index.html">Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell</a> helped me understand how Haskell supported parallel and concurrent programming. Though I learned many valuable lessons from the book, I also felt that the lazy nature of Haskell didn’t go well with parallel programming.</p>

<p>I have spent more than 10 years of my career on embedded systems and increasingly got frustrated with the tools available. So I decided to teach myself Haskell again and use it at work. This time I started to read classic papers on functional programming and Haskell.</p>
<p>Philip Wadler’s <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/marktoberdorf/baastad.pdf">Monads for functional programming</a> clicked my mind and I finally became enlightened. The paper is really well written, but I don’t think I could understand <em>Monad</em> just because I read the paper. Years of trials and errors were necessary to understand abstract concepts like monad. It was the most exciting moment of my long journey to Haskell.</p>
<p>Once I understood how I could learn abstractions, the rest was easy. Now I don’t get discouraged just because I don’t understand abstractions at first glance. It takes time and practice to understand abstract things. I also realized that monad was just the beginning. There exist many Haskell idioms that require other abstract concepts such as <em>applicative functor</em>, <em>arrow</em>, <em>profunctor</em> and so on.</p>
<p>Here is the list of papers I found most enlightening when learning Haskell. I also recommend you read any paper with “Functional Pearl” attached to it.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/fold.pdf">A tutorial on the universality and expressiveness of fold</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pearl.pdf">Monadic Parsing in Haskell</a></li>
<li><a href="http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/POPL96-Modular-interpreters.pdf">Monad Transformers and Modular Interpreters</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.ru.nl/~W.Swierstra/Publications/DataTypesALaCarte.pdf">Data types a la carte</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/jeremy.gibbons/publications/iterator.pdf">The Essence of the Iterator Pattern</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.st.cs.uni-saarland.de/edu/seminare/2005/advanced-fp/docs/huet-zipper.pdf">The Zipper</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I was confident that Haskell was a good programming language and I was looking for opportunities to use Haskell in production. Bryan O’Sullivan, Don Stewart, and John Goerzen’s <a href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/">Real World Haskell</a> was a good reference in this direction. It showed how I could use Haskell to do my daily work such as networking, system programming, databases and web programming.</p>
<p>Finally, I started to read real-world Haskell code available on the hackage and realized that the <em>Haskell I know</em> was different from the <em>Haskell that is actually used</em>. Real world Haskell uses lots of GHC extensions which makes me feel it is an entirely different language. A typical Haskell module starts with:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>{-# LANGUAGE CPP                        #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts           #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE ConstraintKinds            #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances          #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE FunctionalDependencies     #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings          #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE QuasiQuotes                #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE RecordWildCards            #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE TupleSections              #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies               #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE RankNTypes                 #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE DeriveDataTypeable         #-}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It seems sticking to Haskell 98 or 2000 does not have much practical sense because many Haskell packages already use many GHC extensions. So I learned them too. <a href="https://ocharles.org.uk/blog/posts/2014-12-01-24-days-of-ghc-extensions.html">24 Days of GHC Extensions</a> was a really great way of learning this topic.</p>
<p>I like the approach of <a href="http://www.yesodweb.com/book/haskell">Yesod Web Framework Book</a> which explains the GHC extensions used in the library before explaining how to use the library. This is often the first step to learn a new library for many Haskell programmers. For example, you can’t use <a href="http://haskell-servant.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Servant</a> unless you understand <em>DataKinds</em> and <em>TypeOperators</em>. So I encourage Haskell library authors to write more about the GHC extensions they use.</p>
<p>I also found that some packages are essential to use Haskell in practice.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>String</code> type has problems. You need either <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text">text</a> or <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bytestring">bytestring</a> for efficient string data processing.</li>
<li>Lazy IO looks nice, but does not work well in practice. To process streaming data properly you need either <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes-4.3.2/docs/Pipes-Tutorial.html">pipes</a> or <a href="https://github.com/snoyberg/conduit#readme">conduit</a>.</li>
<li>You will need a custom monad or monad transformer for your application sooner or later. Either <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl">mtl</a> or <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers">transformers</a> is required.</li>
<li>JSON is a really universal data exchange format these days. <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson-1.1.0.0/docs/Data-Aeson.html">aeson</a> will help you here.</li>
<li><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck">QuickCheck</a> is a bonus you get from using Haskell!</li>
</ul>

<p>I founded a small Haskell shop this year and started to use Haskell in production. I realized that using Haskell in production was, surprisingly, easier than learning Haskell. It took me more than 10 years to learn Haskell, but I felt confident that I could use Haskell in production only after a few months of experiments.</p>
<p>There is one thing I would like to emphasize. Using Haskell does not mean that you must understand all the dependencies you use. Haskell programmers tend to care much about the implementation details of their dependencies because Haskell makes it so easy to understand the meaning of programs with types and equational reasoning. But in my opinion, this is a blessed curse.</p>
<p>That’s not how civilization works. You can drive a car without understanding how engines work. Python or JavaScript programmers do not care about the implementation details of their dependencies because it is simply impossible. Haskell is no exception. Time and money are limited. Please don’t spend too much time on understanding things. Spend more time on building things. Be practical.</p>
<p>Fortunately, some library authors provide a high-level overview of their library. <a href="https://www.andres-loeh.de/Servant/servant-wgp.pdf">Type-level Web APIs with Servant</a> is a great example. It explains the core concepts and the implementation techniques of the library without involving accidental complexities of implementation details. I would love to see more papers like this.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.stackage.org/">Stackage</a> and the <a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/">Stack</a> are indispensable tools for using Haskell in production. All the hard work of <a href="https://www.fpcomplete.com/">FP Complete</a> gave me confidence that Haskell was …</p></article></div>

<p>You would have done better in school, for starters. Instead of turning in your bed unable to sleep terrified of the exam coming the next day, you would soundly sleep with the knowledge that you know everything you need to know to ace the exam. And ace it you would indeed.</p>

<p>You would have spent fewer hours studying. How many times have you opened the textbook only to find that you’ve forgotten all that you’d studied the day before? If you did not forget things then those hours you spent studying would always amount to something, instead of leaving you feeling like you’re swimming against the current. School might even have been fun if you did not forget.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What would your career look like if you did not forget?</p>

<p>Forgetfulness affects us all. There is no one that has not grappled with this problem before. Our lives would be better if we did not forget.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <span>forgetting is inescapable.</span> There is no such thing as a perfect memory. I am not here to sell you on a magic pill that will turn you into Bradley Cooper in the movie Limitless.</p>

<p>However, that doesn’t mean there aren’t things you can do to massively reduce the speed at which you forget things, because there are.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Science has known about what it takes to get memories to stick around in your memory for a long time. It has known about it for a while now, in fact. It’s just that it has done a terrible job so far at making sure that you know about it, you whose life would massively benefit from that knowledge.</p>

<p>My intent for writing this is to correct these wrongs and introduce you to spaced repetition, the more than established method that will put you in control of your memory once and for all, and Anki, the software that will help you do so.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, let’s start at the beginning: <span> What is spaced repetition?</span></p>

<h2 id="the-centuries-old-science-they-dont-tell-you-about">The Centuries Old Science They Don’t Tell You About</h2>

<p>More than a hundred years ago, the German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus not only started the scientific study of memory, but he also made its most impactful discovery.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After all, what discovery could be more impactful than what makes memories stick?</p>

<p>Ebbinghaus created various lists of nonsense syllables that he had to memorize, and once he was able to mouth off the entire list without making a single mistake he would mark on his calendar the day where he had to memorize that list once more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He would have to memorize some lists the day after, others a week and some a whole month after he had first memorized them. Doesn’t sound much fun, does it? This is especially true when you take into account each list must have taken him quite a long time to memorize since by design each of the three-letter syllables he had to study had been chosen so that they weren’t easily remembered. For example, the syllable BOL was out of the question as Ebbinghaus could instead use BALL to recall it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the requisite time had passed, to measure the extent to which he had forgotten the list he’d spent so much time memorizing, he memorized the same list once more. Not only did he have to sit still in his office for a long time trying to memorize a bunch of nonsense words once, he had to do it twice! Throughout his second attempt he did have some help since it would take him less time to memorize the list the second time around if he remembered it from his first foray cramming it into his memory.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If by that point he’d already forgotten it, then it would take him at least as much time to memorize the list the second time as it had the first. However, if some memory of it still lingered in the confines of his mind, he would be able to go through the list faster than before. By varying the amount of time between each attempt, and seeing how that influenced how long it took him then to memorize the list the second time, <span>Ebbinghaus was able to measure the effect time had on his memory.</span></p>

<p>And what an effect it had.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first thing he noticed was that memories are at their most fragile when they are still young. From the data he’d collected, he could see that the bulk of forgetting happens in the few moments after the memory is created. Rather than forgetting happening at a linear pace over time, each day that passes nicking a constant amount of the vitality of a memory until it is completely forgotten, Ebbinghaus discovered <span>forgetting happens rather rapidly at first but slows down afterward.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>In the first few hours of its life, it’s as if your newly created memory has jumped out of a flying airplane and is now free-falling through the sky, the wind buffeting its face violently as it quickly loses altitude. As the ground becomes uncomfortably close, our memory activates its parachute and begins to glide, still falling, of course, but much slower than it was when it first jumped out of the plane.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Now, to be sure, <span>the forgetting curve,</span> as this discovery came to be called, is an important landmark in the scientific study of memory, but it’s not a particularly useful one. We forget things over time; what a discovery! You don’t need to be a top-level scientist to come to that conclusion. It’s why we’re here in the first place!</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b79bb8c6906d331e07905d708043194c5288a3bd/e385a/assets/images/agentleintroductiontoanki/forgettingcurve_alternative.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p> Behold, my superlative drawing skills!</p>
<p>But Ebbinghaus didn’t stop there.
&nbsp;
When he first started learning his lists of nonsense syllables, Ebbinghaus, like many a student, crammed all his studying in a single furious session. But then, possibly because he was fed up with all the cramming, he hit upon the idea of spreading his learning over time. Instead of spending the majority of a day learning one of his lists, he spaced out his learning over a few days. <span>What he found when he did so is the most important discovery about memory that no one ever told you about.</span></p>

<p>You would think not much would change if instead of studying a bunch of material in one day you did so over three or more days. But what Ebbinghaus found was that not only did his memory get stronger, but it also took him less time to memorize his lists. This meant that <span>simply by changing when he studied, Ebbinghaus could have the best of both worlds: a better memory with less time spent studying.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>It need not be pointed out how important a discovery this is. If someone came up to you and told you about a revolutionary studying method that would not only cut the time you spent studying but also get you to retain the things you learn for longer, you would think you were being sold on some sort of scam.</p>

<p>Yet <span>the spacing effect,</span> as Ebbinghaus’ discovery is called, is far from being a scam. It is <span>one of the most scientifically supported discoveries in the entire field of psychology.</span></p>

<p>The gist of the spacing effect is rather simple. Given the choice between massing all your studying or spacing it out over a period of time, you are better served by spacing it out. <span>There is no catch. It really is that simple.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>This means if you are a student and you have an exam coming up a month from now, you should start studying now rather than waiting until a single week is left. If, for example, you’re going to spend 50 hours studying, then spreading those hours over the whole month, ensuring that you get re-exposed to the material in sufficiently spaced intervals, would get you much better results than you would if you crammed those 50 hours in a single stress-filled and coffee-fueled week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, that’s easier said than done.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>The spacing effect is one of the most important weapons a learner can have on his arsenal</span> but knowing about its amazing effects does not mean that we will necessarily apply it. After all, we all know not to eat too many processed foods do we not? Yet, that doesn’t seem to stop many of us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pulling an all-nighter to cram for an exam is like binging on a sugar-filled pastry when one is trying to lose weight, yet the fact it continues to be a staple learning strategy of many a student is a testament to how difficult it can be to embrace the lessons of the spacing effect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If only there were an app for that…</p>

<h2 id="this-app-will-turn-your-memory-into-a-superpower">This App Will Turn Your Memory Into A Superpower</h2>

<p>One hundred years ago Ebbinghaus didn’t have a computer, let alone a smartphone. If he’d had them they would have taken care of the task of spacing what he had to learn for him. Instead, he had to do all of that himself, though if we consider that he was the kind of guy that did not balk at the idea of spending hundreds of hours learning endless lists of nonsense, perhaps he wasn’t that fazed by it.</p>

<p>Thankfully, today we have tools that manage all of that for us.</p>

<p><span> And it all starts with a simple flashcard.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Everyone knows how a flashcard is supposed to work. You write something on the front, then something on the back, and then you’re supposed to recall what it was that you wrote on the back after reading what’s on the front.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Suppose that in the process of studying for a coming exam, you wrote many of these flashcards. You have a big pile of them sitting on your desk and within them are all the things you have to know if you want to ace that exam.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because you know about the spacing effect, you know that cramming those flashcards is a bad strategy, but then how are you supposed to space them out? There are so many cards to keep track of…</p>

<p><span>What    if those flashcards existed on your computer instead?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>If that were possible, then the computer could take care of the task of keeping track when you’re supposed to review your flashcards and you could focus solely on the things that matter, which, in this case, is answering your flashcards correctly and acing that exam.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Which is why spaced repetition software was invented: to take care of all the grunt work so you can easily add spaced repetition into your life.</p>

<p>At its core, all spaced repetition software does is keep track of when to present you with the material that you put in it. It’s called spaced repetition software because they use special algorithms to calculate the optimal interval between when you last reviewed the material and …</p></div></section></div></div>

<p>Several studies have shown that when the use of television or video games increases, IQ and cognitive development decrease.</p>
<p>The main foundations of our intelligence are affected: language, concentration, memory, culture (defined as a body of knowledge that helps us organize and understand the world).</p>
<p>Ultimately, these impacts lead to a significant drop in academic performance.</p>
<p><strong>And why does the use of digital devices cause all that? </strong></p>
<p>The causes are also clearly identified: decrease in the quality and quantity of intrafamily interactions, which are fundamental for the development of language and emotional development; decrease in time devoted to other more enriching activities (homework, music, art, reading, etc.); sleep disruption, which is quantitatively shortened and qualitatively degraded; overstimulation of attention, leading to disorders of concentration, learning and impulsivity; Intellectual under-stimulation, which prevents the brain from unfolding its full potential; and an excessive sedentary lifestyle that, in addition to bodily development, influences brain maturation.</p>
<p><strong>What exactly damage do screens do to the neurological system? </strong></p>
<p>The brain is not a ‘stable’ organ. Its ‘final’ characteristics depend on experience.</p>
<p>The world in which we live, the challenges we face, modify both the structure and its functioning, and some regions of the brain specialize, some networks are created and strengthened, others are lost, some become thicker and others thinner.</p>

</figcaption></figure>
<p>Time spent in front of a screen for recreational reasons has been observed to delay anatomical and functional maturation of the brain within various cognitive networks related to language and attention.</p>
<p>It must be emphasized that not all activities feed the construction of the brain with the same efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>What does it mean? </strong></p>
<p>Activities related to school, intellectual work, reading, music, art, sports, etc. they have a much greater structuring and nourishing power to the brain than recreational screens.</p>
<p>But nothing lasts forever. The potential for brain plasticity is extreme during childhood and adolescence. Afterwards, it begins to fade. It doesn’t go away, but it becomes much less efficient.</p>
<p><img data-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Why-Mexico-is-one-of-the-countries-with-the-most.gif" alt="" cuando="" se="" pone="" una="" pantalla="" en="" manos="" de="" un="" niño="" o="" adolescente,="" casi="" siempre="" prevalecen="" los="" usos="" recreativos="" más="" empobrecedores"",="" source:="" ,="" source="" description:="" image:="" "="" data-lazy-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970619_593_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.png" src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970619_593_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.png"></p>

<p>The brain can be compared to a plasticine. At first, it is wet and easy to sculpt. But over time it becomes drier and much more difficult to mold.</p>
<p>The problem with recreational screens is that they alter the development of our children’s brain and impoverish it.</p>
<p><strong>Are all screens equally harmful? </strong></p>
<p>Nobody says that the “digital revolution” is bad and should be stopped. I myself spend a good part of my working day with digital tools. And when my daughter entered elementary school, I started teaching her how to use some office software and looking for information on the internet.</p>
<p>Should students be taught fundamental computer skills and tools? Clear. Likewise, can digital technology be a relevant tool in the pedagogical arsenal of teachers? Of course, if it is part of a structured educational project and if the use of a certain software effectively promotes transmission.</p>
<p>However, when a screen is placed in the hands of a child or adolescent, the most impoverishing recreational uses almost always prevail.</p>
<p>This includes, in order of importance: television, which remains the number one screen of all ages (movies, series, clips, etc.); then video games (mainly action and violent), and finally, around adolescence, a frenzy of useless self-exposure on social media.</p>
<p><strong>How much time do children and young people usually spend in front of screens? </strong></p>
<p>On average, nearly three hours a day for 2-year-olds, about five hours for 8-year-olds, and more than seven hours for teens.</p>

<figure id=""><img loading="lazy" data-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970620_55_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.jpg" alt="baby using screen" src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970620_55_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.jpg"><figcaption>A 2-year-old child spends almost three hours a day in front of screens. on average.

</figcaption></figure>
<p>This means that before reaching 18 years of age, our children will have spent the equivalent of 30 school years in front of recreational screens or, if you prefer, 16 years of full-time work!
</p>
<p>It is simply insane and irresponsible.</p>
<p><strong>How much time should children spend on recreational screens? </strong></p>
<p>Involving children is important.</p>
<p>They need to be told that recreational screens damage the brain, impair sleep, interfere with language acquisition, weaken academic performance, impair concentration, increase the risk of obesity, etc.</p>
<p>Some studies have shown that it is easier for children and adolescents to follow the rules about screens when their reason for being is explained and discussed with them.</p>
<p><img data-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Why-Mexico-is-one-of-the-countries-with-the-most.gif" alt="" involucrar="" a="" los="" niños="" es="" importante.="" necesitan="" que="" se="" les="" diga="" las="" pantallas="" recreativas="" dañan="" el="" cerebro,="" perjudican="" sueño,="" interfieren="" con="" la="" adquisición="" del="" lenguaje"",="" source:="" ,="" source="" description:="" image:="" "="" data-lazy-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970620_943_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.png" src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970620_943_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.png"></p>

<p>From there, the general idea is simple: at any age, the least is the best.</p>
<p>Beyond this general rule, more specific guidelines can be provided based on the child’s age. Before the age of 6, the ideal is not to have screens (which does not mean that from time to time you cannot watch cartoons with your children).</p>
<p>The earlier they are exposed, the greater the negative impacts and the risk of subsequent excessive consumption.</p>
<p>From 6 years of age, if the contents are adapted and sleep is maintained, it can go up to half an hour a day, even an hour, without an appreciable negative influence.</p>
<p>Other relevant rules: no screens in the morning before going to school, nothing at night before going to bed or when with other people. And, above all, no screens in the bedroom.</p>
<p>But it’s hard to tell our kids that screens are a problem when we, as parents, are constantly connected to our smartphones or game consoles.</p>
<p><img data-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Why-Mexico-is-one-of-the-countries-with-the-most.gif" alt="" reglas="" relevantes:="" nada="" de="" pantallas="" por="" la="" mañana="" antes="" ir="" a="" escuela,="" noche="" irse="" cama...="" ¡sobre="" todo!="" en="" el="" dormitorio"",="" source:="" ,="" source="" description:="" image:="" "="" data-lazy-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970620_123_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.png" src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970620_123_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.png"></p>

<p><strong>Why are many parents unaware of the dangers of screens? </strong></p>
<p>Because the information given to parents is partial and biased. The mainstream media is rife with unsubstantiated claims, misleading propaganda, and inaccurate information. The discrepancy between media content and scientific reality is often disturbing, if not infuriating.</p>
<p>I don’t mean to say that the media is dishonest: separating the wheat from the chaff is not easy, even for honest and conscientious journalists.</p>
<p>But not surprising. The digital industry generates billions of dollars in profits each year. And, obviously, children and adolescents are a very lucrative resource.</p>
<p>And for companies worth billions of dollars, it is easy to find complacent scientists, dedicated lobbyists and enthusiastic traders of doubts.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example.</p>

<figure id=""><img loading="lazy" data-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970620_781_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.jpg" alt="boy playing video games" src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970620_781_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.jpg"><figcaption>Digital companies hire experts to explain how smart gamers are and how good it is to play video games.

</figcaption></figure>
<p>Recently a psychologist, supposedly an expert in video games, explained in various media that these games had positive effects, that they should not be demonized, that not playing could even be a handicap for the future of a child, that the most violent games could have therapeutic actions and be able to quench anger in players, etc.</p>
<p>The problem is that none of the journalists who interviewed this “expert” mentioned that he worked for the video game industry. And this is just one example among the many that are described in my book.</p>
<p>This is not something new: it happened in the past with tobacco, global warming, pesticides, sugar, etc.</p>
<p>But I think there is room for hope. Over time, reality becomes increasingly difficult to deny.</p>
<p><img data-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Why-Mexico-is-one-of-the-countries-with-the-most.gif" alt="" en="" una="" investigación="" se="" entregaron="" consolas="" de="" juegos="" a="" niños="" que="" iban="" bien="" la="" escuela.="" después="" 4="" meses,="" descubrió="" pasaban="" más="" tiempo="" jugando="" y="" menos="" haciendo="" tareas"",="" source:="" ,="" source="" description:="" image:="" "="" data-lazy-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970621_226_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.png" src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970621_226_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.png"></p>

<p><strong>There are studies that affirm, for example, that video games help to obtain better academic results … </strong></p>
<p>Let me put it frankly: that’s sheer nonsense.</p>
<p>That idea is a true masterpiece of propaganda. It is mainly based on a few isolated studies with rotten data, which are published in secondary journals and are often contradicted.</p>
<p>In an interesting experimental investigation, game consoles were given to children who were doing well in school. After four months, they were found to spend more time playing games and less time doing homework. Their grades dropped about 5% (which is a lot in just four months!).</p>
<p>In another study, children had to learn a list of words. An hour later, some were allowed to play a car racing video game. Two hours later they went to bed.</p>

</figure>
<p>The next morning, the children who did not play recalled about 80% of the lesson compared to 50% of the players.
</p>
<p>The authors found that playing interfered with sleep and memorization.</p>
<p><strong>How </strong><strong>believe to be</strong><strong>members of</strong><strong> this digital generation </strong><strong>when </strong><strong>become adults? </strong></p>
<p>I often hear that digital natives know “differently.” The idea is that although they show linguistic, attention and knowledge deficits, they are very good at “other things”.</p>
<p>The question lies in the definition of those “other things”.</p>
<p>Various studies indicate that, in contrast to common beliefs, they are not very good with computers.</p>
<p>A report from the European Union even explains that their low digital competence hinders the adoption of educational technologies in schools.</p>
<p>Other studies also indicate that they are not very efficient at processing and understanding the vast amount of information available on the internet.</p>

<p><em>I was a naive kid. When I was younger, whenever I came across books like <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/rich-dad-poor-dad/" target="_blank" aria-label="Rich Dad Poor Dad (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rich Dad Poor Dad</a>, I thought that by just reading what’s written inside I will magically become a millionaire. Or, by studying the lessons presented in <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-people/" target="_blank" aria-label="The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</a>, I will transform into a successful business owner who is not holding any sabotaging habits. After all, these books always came with a step-by-step framework that I diligently followed. And while didn’t come close to becoming an ultra-rich entrepreneur, like these titles promised, how my life turned out eventually, which is not bad at all, is thanks to my reading habit.</em></p>



<p>I actually used to despise reading. My parents were constantly shoving books in my face and forcing me to read literature that didn’t even interest me closely. </p>



<p>The books I had to read according to my folks during my teenage years were either part of my school curriculum or titles that were famous years ago. Of course, like every self-respecting teenager trying to look cool, I rebelled against these rules and did the only thing I could – I stopped reading altogether.</p>



<p>Somewhere deep down though, I knew that reading was good, but spending my time studying historical novels related to my country, or fact-heavy encyclopedia-like hardcovers didn’t seem practical to me.</p>



<p>Probably it’s because I grew up playing video games, or because my brother and I collected choose-your-own-adventure type of books when we were younger. But I always assumed that I should get some sort of outcome when I was reading a book. A book should help me learn a skill, conquer a territory, slave a dragon, and in way level up.</p>



<p>Sadly, this wasn’t the case with the novels that the school system imposed on me. These books were only throwing isolated facts that were not related to my existence here and now. That’s why I was careless about literature when I was a teenager.</p>



<p>Fortunately, later in my life, I re-evaluate my relationship with the libraries.</p>



<p>Things changed when I found out about the existence of the applied psychology category. At least that’s how the libraries of my country label the self-help genre. I was thrilled. Books that can help you master a skill? It sounded magical. </p>



<p>That’s when I found titles like <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/think-and-grow-rich/" target="_blank" aria-label="Think and Grow Rich (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Think and Grow Rich</a>, <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/influence/" target="_blank" aria-label="Influence (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Influence</a>, <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/outwitting-the-devil/" target="_blank" aria-label="Outwitting the Devil (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Outwitting the Devil</a>, and similar mind-transforming hardcovers. To me, these books looked like volumes full of spells – filled with practical advice that can change your life when you apply them.</p>



<p>That’s when my reading journey began. </p>



<p>To this date, I’ve probably read more than 150 books. 100 of these titles are carefully categorized and summarized <a href="https://durmonski.com/category/book-summaries/" target="_blank" aria-label="here (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> on my site.</p>



<p>I learned a lot from these books in terms of skills and know-how. But I also learned something that I believe is more valuable – how to approach reading. </p>



<p>When I first started reading, I picked the books that were in front of me – sort to speak. I always grabbed the most talked-about books, thinking, that they hold all the answers in the world.</p>



<p>Now, I know that the best-sellers section doesn’t include the finest titles. Also, I know that reading alone, or reading piles of books, is only half of the battle. I spend a lot of time before I decide what I should read. My approach to books and what titles I should read is completely transformed. But most importantly, I do my best to implement what’s mentioned in the titles I read.</p>



<p>In this article, I’ll share with you 10 thoughts after reading 100 books. The goal is not only to help you become a better reader and better book-picker, but also to share with you some insights about how books can change you for the better.</p>



<p>So, here are 10 things I learned from reading and later <a aria-label="summarizing (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://durmonski.com/private/summarizing-books/" target="_blank">summarizing</a> 100 books.</p>







<h2 id="0-10-thoughts-from-reading-100-books-">10 Thoughts from Reading 100 Books </h2>





<h3 id="1-1-best-selling-books-are-usually-crap">1. Best-Selling Books are Usually Crap</h3>



<p>This is not entirely true of course.</p>



<p>There are a lot of exceptions. For example, books like <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/atomic-habits/" target="_blank" aria-label="Atomic Habits (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomic Habits</a> or <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/the-laws-of-human-nature/" target="_blank" aria-label="The Laws of Human Nature (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Laws of Human Nature</a> are nice examples of how good work pays off and how word-of-mouth has the power to bring good literature into the hands of millions of people.</p>



<p>But in general, best-selling books are created with the wrong initiatives.</p>



<p>As strange as it might sound, the usefulness of the content for the authors of best-sellers is not the most important thing in a book – it’s the desire to make money. What I found out is that they usually grab a bunch of blog posts from their site, put them in one place, and call it a book. This means that the content is absent from real meaningful research. You’re basically paying (not always, but a lot of times) for content that’s already free but this time it’s on paper.</p>



<p>Most best-selling self-help books are full of vague conclusions, offer no value whatsoever, and can be summarized in the following sentence: “You can do it!”</p>



<p>Why they are successful then?</p>



<p>If you trace back the wide success of these popular books, you’ll spot that the author is someone who has a large online audience. And when you have a network of people who are following you online, the success of your book is guaranteed.</p>



<p>Also, if the above is true, the publisher will invest a lot of funds to market the book. This basically means that the success of the book relies on the large email list and social media following of the author – the distribution channels – not on the actual content.</p>



<p>Therefore, such books, best-selling books, should be approached with caution.</p>







<h3 id="2-2-read-foundational-books-often-mentioned-in-the-bibliography-section">2. Read Foundational Books – Often Mentioned in The Bibliography Section</h3>



<p>I used to skip the bibliography section of the books I read. You know, the part in the back of the book where the author lists the titles he used in the creation of his work or such that somehow influenced his project.</p>



<p>Now, I can’t wait to check this section so I can add new additions to my to-read list.</p>



<p>Once you spend enough time investigating in this rarely explored section of the back of the books, you spot patterns. You see how the same titles are cited again and again.</p>



<p>And once you read some of these books, you get to see why they are so frequently mentioned in the corner of the most successful books that are full of vague action tips – because these rarely-mentioned by big sites books are the real deal. They are full of insights and valuable thinking patterns that can change the way you approach life.</p>



<p>For example, if you want to increase your productivity, you will surely find a lot of self-help books that promise to boost your overall performance. But if you want to <em>get</em> why you procrastinate, really understand why your body is now one with the couch, you should read <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/flow/" target="_blank" aria-label="Flow (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flow</a> by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.</p>



<p>If you want to find meaning in our crazy world and escape the modern dogma of consumerism, you’ll surely stumble on less than favorable titles like The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari, or Girl, Wash Your Face. But if you really want to understand how meaning is formed and what does it take to find your course in life, you should read <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/the-evolving-self/" target="_blank" aria-label="The Evolving Self (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Evolving Self</a> by Robert Kegan and/or <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/to-have-or-to-be/" target="_blank" aria-label="To Have or to Be? (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">To Have or to Be?</a> by Erich Fromm.</p>



<p>Sadly, people don’t want to read these books.</p>



<p>They don’t have enough “social status” and sharing them with others won’t inspire a lot of interest from your peers towards you.</p>



<p>It’s kind of like in the tech industry. You know that a regular phone, a device that costs around 500 bucks will do the job perfectly. But no, you want the latest iPhone because this is what people really value and expect to see.</p>



<p>That’s why we spend our time digesting famous books. We are more interested in impressing others when they check our reading list, not so much ourselves.</p>







<h3 id="3-3-good-books-are-usually-hard-to-get">3. Good Books are Usually Hard to Get</h3>



<p>Hard to read, full of words you don’t really understand, these are usually the best books – especially in the field of <a href="https://durmonski.com/category/book-summaries/philosophy/" target="_blank" aria-label="philosophy (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">philosophy</a> and <a href="https://durmonski.com/category/book-summaries/psychology-books/" target="_blank" aria-label="psychology (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">psychology</a>.</p>



<p>At first, if you decide to explore such titles, you’ll blame the author for not using simpler words and for not expressing himself better. And if there are long-winded sections where you don’t get what the premise of the idea is, you’ll most probably ditch the book and find something else to read instead.</p>



<p>But these elaborate creations full of complicated phrases are what you need to level up your thinking.</p>



<p>Surely reading a novel where you can predict what will happen next feels good. But real learning comes from books that flex your mind and prompt you to think about the argument the author is making.</p>



<p>This is something I only recently realized. Before, I was cynical about hard to get books. That’s why I rated one of the most cited books poorly – <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/thinking-fast-and-slow/" target="_blank" aria-label="Thinking, Fast and Slow (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a>.</p>



<p>When I read it 2 years ago, I considered it unrelentingly tedious and pretentious. But the book wasn’t the problem, I was.</p>



<p>My assumption was that books have to be easy to get. Now, after reading more than 100 books and summarizing most of them, I know that’s not the case.</p>



<p>A good book doesn’t have to be easy to understand. A good book should make you stop and think about what is said inside. To confuse you and make you re-read the same passage again and again. If the pages inside don’t prompt you to think and even make you feel lost at times, then you’re not reading the proper title.</p>







<h3 id="4-4-figure-out-what-you-want-to-learn-first-then-search-for-a-book">4. Figure Out What You Want to Learn First, Then Search For a Book</h3>



<p>Most people approach reading the wrong way. They don’t think about what they want to learn and master, they simply read books that are in front of them. Best-selling books, or books recommended by their peers.</p>



<p>This approach is fine if you simply want to relax and unwind from your busy day. But if you want to improve in a specific area, you shouldn’t pick the title that’s sitting on the most popular reading list. You should, first, figure out what you want to learn and then go to the library with a clear goal.</p>



<p>That’s usually how we approach pretty much everything in life. We don’t hop online with clear goals in …</p></div></div></div>

November 20, 2020 | https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/haskell202x/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/haskell202x/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Haskell2020 is the long-awaited sequel to Haskell2010 — a formal, prescriptive standard of the Haskell language, that all implementations should adhere to. Today we have two previous standards, Haskell2010 and Haskell98, but neither is particularly in-line with the language as it’s written in this day and age. The aim of Haskell2020 is to bring these older standards in line with the way the language is actually practiced.</p>
<p>Today, there is only one real implementation of Haskell: the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC). GHC is a Haskell2010-compliant compiler, but extends Haskell via <em>language extensions</em> — explicitly opt-in features that deviate from the standard. In GHC 8.6.5, there are 125 different language extensions, and <a href="https://gist.github.com/atondwal/ee869b951b5cf9b6653f7deda0b7dbd8">an analysis</a> shows that 10% of Haskell files in the wild enable 10 or more extensions.</p>
<p>All of this is to say that a good chunk of the Haskell being written in the real world <em>is not Haskell2010 compatible.</em> And the situation is only going to get worse.</p>
<p>It might not be immediately evident to you why this is a bad thing. As excellent a piece of software as GHC is, tying our language to a single implementation is unwise and shortsighted. As long as Haskell is defined implicitly by its implementation in GHC, no other implementation has a chance — they will always be forever playing catch-up.</p>
<p>C++ was in a similar situation in the early naughties; the de facto C++ compiler GCC was the only heavy-hitter in town. While it got the job done, it had some pretty terrible ergonomics — so bad that it spun up a cottage industry of attempting to <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/1956/generate-the-longest-error-message-in-c">generate the worst error messages</a>. In 2007, Clang — an alternative industrial-strength compiler — was released, which strove to be compatible with GCC, but also to dramatically improve the ergonomics. This friendly competition has spurred both projects to become significantly better.</p>
<p>And we have seen similar beneficial competition (albeit certainly less friendly) in the Haskell world. Five years ago, Cabal sort-of got the job done for building Haskell projects, but there was this thing called “Cabal Hell” that bit <em>everyone.</em> It got the job done if you knew how it worked, which all the developers did, but the pain was felt by everyone else. Then Stack was released, which elegantly solved Cabal Hell, and <em>just worked.</em> It wasn’t perfect, but my god was it an improvement on the state of the world. In recent memory, Cabal has seen unparalleled improvements in its usability, after languishing for <em>years</em> with respect to usability complaints.</p>
<p>My point? Competition is a good thing, not just for users, but for the health of the ecosystem at large. And by extension, we should look at the status quo of today’s Haskell world with suspicion. And getting a good, prescriptive specification of what Haskell <em>is</em> would go a long way towards alleviating this issue.</p>
<p>So why do I bring all of this up? It’s my impression that the current Haskell2020 efforts are dead in all but name. The <a href="https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-prime/">official mailing list</a> didn’t see any activity for 12 of the last 24 months. Of the months that did see activity, several of their volumes are measured in <em>bytes.</em> At time of writing, the official Haskell2020 website’s certificates are expired, and have been for two weeks.</p>
<p>None of this is meant to demonize the standards committee. But for whatever reason, it’s pretty clear that Haskell2020 is not going to happen in its current incarnation. After all, 2020 is coming up pretty dang soon!</p>
<p>Forgive the melodrama, but I truly believe that this situation is an existential risk for our beloved language and community. There are already well-founded <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/dpr276/what_is_the_status_of_ghc_linear_types/f5yjg67/">murmurings of dissatisfaction</a>, and <em>lots</em> of complaints about the lack of good tooling (though regrettably I can’t find any links right now.)</p>
<p>So what’s the real problem here? As a complete outsider — reading between the lines of discussions I’ve had with a few of the Haskell2020 committee members — my guess is this: <strong>a lack of leadership.</strong> It’s not that the committee members don’t care, it’s that nobody cares <em>sufficiently</em> to overcome the momentum and push the thing through to completion. Furthermore, these people are busy with their own cool projects, and committee work is always a thankless job.</p>
<p>The good news: a lack of leadership is a <em>very easy problem to solve.</em> If you care about this problem, <strong>just take the reigns.</strong> That’s all there is to it. <em>Anyone can do it.</em> Yes, even you, gentle reader! Nobody needs to elevate you to a position of power. There’s no admissions process. You don’t need to be given any <em>authority</em> in order to take the lead here. This is a thing that everybody wants, but there’s a coordination problem, and the only reason it hasn’t been done yet is that nobody has done it.</p>
<p>If you want more assurance about that: as a member of the GHC Steering Committee, <strong>I will personally ratify any reasonable draft standard of Haskell 202x</strong> and vote in favor that GHC adheres to that standard. I have confirmation from at least two other members of the committee that they will also do so.</p>
<p>As a rough estimate, the effort involved in Haskel202x is about half a person-year. Most of that will be spent doing unsexy, administrative things like setting deadlines, cajoling the right people for opinions, and writing a big, boring document. Not a lot of fun, to be sure, but <em>very doable.</em> The only challenge here is to not lose motivation for six months.</p>
<p>Should you still have doubts, I’d like to give another example: the GHC Steering Committee. Despite some (fair) criticisms, all things considered, the Steering Committee is a pretty successful organization. But <em>literally the only reason</em> for that success is Joachim’s unyielding desire for it to succeed. Without his monthly emails reminding everyone of the work to be done, and who is responsible for what, the Committee would collapse in three months. Nobody gave Joachim this responsibility, he just took it and owned it. In my opinion, the entire Haskell community is deeply indebted to Joachim on this front.</p>
<p>If all of this sounds inspiring to you, I urge you to take up the mantle and <em>make this thing happen.</em> It’s the first step towards a much better Haskell world, and it’s an amazingly actionable one. You can help change the world for the better, and we will all be indebted to you when you pull it off.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>AIS data are being integrated in many applications. Managing those data at scale can prove cumbersome. This post introduces TrueSea by SenX, a turnkey solution for AIS data built on the acclaimed Warp 10 Geo Time Series platform.</p><article>
      
<p>Data from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_identification_system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Automatic Identification System</a> (AIS for short) allows the tracking of vessels around the world. They are being integrated into a growing number of applications from insurance companies, defense agencies, or financial services.</p>



<p>These data are emitted periodically by ships at sea or at moorings and can represent millions of daily messages, bringing with them challenges of their own. </p>



<p>This blog post will present some of those challenges and how SenX can help you solve them, creating more value from all those AIS messages.</p>



<h2>What is AIS?</h2>



<p>The Automatic Identification System was created to increase the safety at sea by enabling ships to identify nearby vessels to avoid collisions and by facilitating Search and Rescue (SAR) operations. It was made mandatory by the 2002 IMO SOLAS agreement for all vessels above 300 GT.</p>



<p><strong>Technically AIS is a system that transmits over VHF short messages with information about the vessels.</strong> </p>



<p>There are three main types of information being transmitted.</p>



<ul><li>Static infos about the ship, such as its name and IMO number, its size or type, and the location of the antenna acquiring the position, which is important on a 300m tanker or cargo ship for example. Those informations are transmitted every 6 minutes.</li><li>Voyage informations, also transmitted every 6 minutes. These include the type of cargo, the current destination of the ship and its ETA, its planned route, and some safety-related infos.</li><li>Lastly, dynamic informations which are transmitted more often when the ship is moving and depending on its speed. Those infos include the vessel's speed and course on ground, its heading, its rate of turn, navigation status, and other indicators.</li></ul>



<h2>Where can AIS data be acquired?</h2>



<p>AIS messages are transmitted via VHF radio waves in an unencrypted format. They can be picked up by any station with a line of sight view of the emitter's antenna. This has led to the proliferation of hobbyists on coastal areas deploying cheap <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SDR</a> dongles with Open Source <a href="https://github.com/dgiardini/rtl-ais" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">software</a> able to decode the AIS chatter.</p>



<p>This craze soon led to the creation of web services that offered to concentrate the data coming from individual stations and to redistribute the consolidated stream to all participants. </p>



<p>The two more popular such services are <a href="https://www.marinetraffic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MarineTraffic</a> and <a href="https://www.aishub.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AISHub</a>. The latter is purely a community oriented service while the former has turned into a commercial provider of the data while retaining its redistribution to participating stations.</p>

<p>More recently, companies such as <a href="https://www.orbcomm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ORBCOMM</a>, <a href="https://spire.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spire,</a> or <a href="https://www.spacequest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SpaceQuest</a> have launched constellations of satellites carrying a payload capable of collecting AIS data. They thus extending the available data to those coming from ships in the open sea.</p>



<p><strong>AIS data can be purchased from those companies, either as a real time stream or as historical datasets. </strong>Their offerings mainly differ by the coverage they can provide and particularities of their own APIs. But the format of the data is common since it is dictated by the AIS standard.</p>



<h2>What usage can be made of AIS data?</h2>



<p>Over the years, AIS data have been used for a growing number of types of applications. The first uses were those for which AIS was invented, the safety of ships at sea. But soon after the data started being collected and consolidated by community websites, uses not at sea started booming.</p>



<p>There are far too many uses of AIS data today to endeavor into naming them all. But we can list a few such as <a href="https://www.e-odyn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e-ODyn</a> computing oceanic currents, <a href="https://www.quiet-oceans.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quiet Oceans</a> forecasting ocean noise, or <a href="https://www.kpler.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kpler</a> providing energy market intelligence.</p>



<h2>What is a typical pipeline around AIS data?</h2>



<p>The provider or pool or providers you have selected will make their AIS data available to you via a real-time feed and/or sets of downloadable files.  Your first task will be to listen to those feeds and retrieve those files. Then immediately you will need to start storing those data to start building your AIS trove.</p>



<p>This storage layer will need to be constructed with usability in mind. It means that the data must be accessible by the applications you intend to build.</p>



<p>Your real-time feed may need to be connected to a stream processing engine for on-the-fly analysis and decision.</p>



<p>And lastly, your historical datasets will need to be available for large scale batch processing, whether for detecting specific situations in the past, creating <a href="https://help.marinetraffic.com/hc/en-us/articles/204802167-Display-Density-Maps-on-the-Live-Map" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">custom visualizations</a>, or determining which ships went where in order to gather intelligence from past voyages.</p>



<h2>What are the challenges of working with AIS data?</h2>



<p>Right after connecting to your first AIS feed and getting the first few files, <strong>you may realize that these data may quickly prove more difficult to work with than what you may have expected.</strong></p>



<p>Your choice of database fills rapidly. The developers are demanding more performance. This leads to the creating of more and more indices which in turn increases the rate at which your disk fill.</p>



<p>The way your applications need to access data usually also evolve rapidly. You built your system with requirements for fetching data from a bounding box, but you now get requests for identifying specific types of ships which went through important trade routes such as the Panama and Suez canals over the course of the <a href="https://blog.senx.io/the-covid-19-pandemic-and-the-art-of-geo-time-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID-19 lockdown</a>, or find how ships called in various world ports over an extended period of time. </p>



<p>New uses of the data you had not planned when you first designed your system and which now occupy your teams more than you had expected and put your cloud bills through the roof as you need more and more power to mitigate bad design choices.</p>



<p>Your team will quickly need to learn more than they want about spatio-temporal indexing, space-filling curves, efficient data representations. All of this so that you can use data that you pay every month.</p>



<p>This type of situation adds a lot of stress to many teams:</p>



<ul><li>product teams which cannot deliver the features they promised to their customers, </li><li>data teams which struggle to scale their databases, </li><li>and finance teams which see costs increasing all over the place with expensive data not being put to work to produce value as it was originally planned.</li></ul>



<h2>How can SenX help?</h2>



<p>You can decide that your team has the time and ability to become top notch spatio-temporal gurus. But if that is not the case or if that objective is not aligned with your business goals we think that SenX can help.</p>



<p><a href="https://senx.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SenX</a> is the creator of <a href="https://warp10.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warp 10,</a> a software suite for managing and analyzing spatio-temporal sequences we call <a href="https://blog.senx.io/tag/geo-time-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Geo Time Series</a>, and it happens that AIS data exactly fit this definition!</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As it happens, we distribute Warp 10 as open-source so you can grab it and thank us for all the fish, putting it in the hands of your already stressed-out data teams who will surely appreciate they get an extra tool to master.</p>



<p><strong>Or you can decide to contact us to help you solve your AIS issues.</strong> </p>



<p>Over the years we have built quite an expertise in handling spatio-temporal data at scale, whether for aircraft manufacturers, offshore racing teams, or defense agencies. AIS is such a good fit for our technologies that <strong>we have created an offering dedicated to the management of those data, TrueSea.</strong></p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div>
<p>Mod­ern ren­der­ing sys­tems are con­fron­ted with a daunt­ingly large and grow­ing set of re­quire­ments: in their pur­suit of real­ism, phys­ic­ally based tech­niques must in­creas­ingly ac­count for in­tric­ate prop­er­ties of light, such as its spec­tral com­pos­i­tion or po­lar­iz­a­tion. To re­duce pro­hib­it­ive ren­der­ing times, vec­tor­ized ren­der­ers ex­ploit co­her­ence via in­struc­tion-level par­al­lel­ism on CPUs and GPUs. Dif­fer­en­ti­able ren­der­ing al­gorithms propag­ate de­riv­at­ives through a sim­u­la­tion to op­tim­ize an ob­ject­ive func­tion, e.g., to re­con­struct a scene from ref­er­ence im­ages. Ca­ter­ing to such di­verse use cases is chal­len­ging and has led to nu­mer­ous pur­pose-built sys­tems—partly, be­cause ret­ro­fit­ting fea­tures of this com­plex­ity onto an ex­ist­ing ren­der­er in­volves an er­ror-prone and in­feas­ibly in­trus­ive trans­form­a­tion of ele­ment­ary data struc­tures, in­ter­faces between com­pon­ents, and their im­ple­ment­a­tions (in oth­er words,&nbsp;everything).</p>
<p>We pro­pose Mit­suba 2, a ver­sat­ile ren­der­er that is in­trins­ic­ally re­tar­get­able to vari­ous ap­plic­a­tions in­clud­ing the ones lis­ted above. Mit­suba 2 is im­ple­men­ted in mod­ern C++ and lever­ages tem­plate meta­pro­gram­ming to re­place types and in­stru­ment the con­trol flow of com­pon­ents such as BSD­Fs, volumes, emit­ters, and ren­der­ing al­gorithms. At com­pile time, it auto­mat­ic­ally trans­forms arith­met­ic, data struc­tures, and func­tion dis­patch, turn­ing gen­er­ic al­gorithms in­to a vari­ety of ef­fi­cient im­ple­ment­a­tions without the te­di­um of manu­al re­design. Pos­sible trans­form­a­tions in­clude chan­ging the rep­res­ent­a­tion of col­or, gen­er­at­ing a “wide” ren­der­er that op­er­ates on bundles of light paths, just-in-time com­pil­a­tion to cre­ate com­pu­ta­tion­al ker­nels that run on the <span>GPU</span>, and for­ward/re­verse-mode auto­mat­ic dif­fer­en­ti­ation. Trans­form­a­tions can be chained, which fur­ther en­riches the space of al­gorithms de­rived from a single gen­er­ic&nbsp;im­ple­ment­a­tion.</p>
<p>We demon­strate the ef­fect­ive­ness and sim­pli­city of our ap­proach on sev­er­al ap­plic­a­tions that would be very chal­len­ging to cre­ate without as­sist­ance: a ren­der­ing al­gorithm based on co­her­ent <span>MCMC</span> ex­plor­a­tion, a caustic design meth­od for gradi­ent-in­dex op­tics, and a tech­nique for re­con­struct­ing het­ero­gen­eous me­dia in the pres­ence of mul­tiple&nbsp;scat­ter­ing.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blog">
                    <h2>It is a choice people tend to ignore</h2>
<p>People in life try to do everything at once. They think that the world is so big that it doesn’t matter what they did before or what their choices though.</p>
<p>People think the only thing that matters is that they have tomorrow. Tomorrow they will wake up, and their life will be different.</p>
<p>Well, that is not the case. Human beings only exist because of our past experiences and decisions. These decisions form us both physically and mentally make us into what we are today. We get shaped but what we do and what we choose to be associated with.</p>
<p>If you want to be honest, there is a way for you to be an honest type of person.</p>
<p>If you want to be successful, then you can be a successful type of person.</p>
<p>We are not what we tell ourselves and everyone around us. We are what we do. </p>
<p>This about it this way, an honest person would tell the waiter if your food was bad. An honest person would tell his friend that he thinks that his idea sucks. An honest person would not be very popular among his peers as honesty is a very dangerous thing.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a “Nice” person would lie to both waiter and his friend.</p>
<h2>Get complimentary identifications</h2>
<p>If you are looking to improve, then you have to choose wisely <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/understanding-life-16-11-2020">what type of person you want to be.</a></p>
<p>Most of the type, it won’t be a single <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/quality-over-quantity-in-writing">identification</a> as “I want to be reliable”.</p>
<p>It would most likely be “I want to have enough money to be happy, and I want people to think I am reliable.”</p>
<p>This consist of many identifications. What you need to make sure when setting goals for yourself is not to have contrary ones.</p>
<p>One can not be fully honest and fully nice at the same time. He can be a mixture of both, but both of this contradict each other too much to coexist happily.</p>
<p>Think of it as synonyms and antonyms. You either contradict or support your identification.</p>
<h2>Your surrounding</h2>
<p>You must have heard that having a proper environment and good friends is very important. Every singly conference on self-improvement talks about it.</p>
<p>Even great minds of the past 200 years have all been saying the same thing over and over. Warren Buffet and Steve Jobs were heave advocates of the great surrounding.</p>
<p>You might not have realised how old this saying is though.</p>
<p>“Show me your friends, and I’ll show you your future.” Has been around for generations. It’s a Biblical concept.</p>
<p>In Proverbs 13:20, Solomon, the wise-guy, wrote: </p>
<p><code>“He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed.”</code></p>
<p>Is this not crazy enough for you to start caring about your friends?</p>
<p>Most of the time, the relationships form because it is very easy. Why do most people have friends that are their colleagues? Because they spend every single day together at work.</p>
<p>Why do people from the same street know each other so well and most of the time become friends? Well, they are right there. </p>
<p>If you want to stick to a habit, make it easy.</p>
<p>With friends though, I would say that you should go for quality over quantity.</p>
<p>We, as humans, can be influenced very easily. We follow what the majority is doing. We think just as the majority does. This instinct is in our blood and bones since ancient times. We always wanted and still want to fit in.</p>
<p>Before if you didn’t have the same opinion on things, you were exiled from the tribe. Back then, this meant sure death.</p>
<p>In the modern world, not fitting in also guarantees us an exile, a monetary and social one. Not many people would want to talk to you. Your prospects of being successful financially also drop close to 0.</p>
<p>Why is this important? Imagine you have a neighbour. But he is not smart, interesting or has anything new to say, who is really missing out here?</p>
<p>There is such a thing as negative progress or degradation. This is exactly what happens when you associate yourself with friends such as that.</p>
<p>You want to spend time with the most amazing people. Those that make your blood boil and those that make you look up to them at everything they do.</p>
<p>Don’t think that one day doesn’t matter. One day become one week and one week becomes a month.</p>
<p>Change things as soon as you get around to it.</p>
<p>Start now. Get perfect later.</p>

<p><span>

02 Aug 2020

</span></p><p>I joined Roblox at the end of 2012 as a rendering engineer; I had just spent more than a year working on various titles from FIFA franchise after years of console game development and was becoming a bit tired of the “big game development”. My work on FIFA was as a contractor and I got an offer for a full-time position, but I also had a friend who worked at Roblox reach out and offer me to move to California and work on Roblox. I knew absolutely nothing about Roblox, but California was nice and my friend told me it would be awesome. The platform was so different (and so strange!) that I decided to take a chance - here I am, 8 years later, still working at Roblox and enjoying it. I started on my first full time job in April 2007 so at this point I’ve worked for 13 years in game development and 8 of them were at Roblox.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>My memory works in interesting ways. I remember my interview pretty well, I remember having lunch at some place in San Mateo downtown near the Roblox HQ - a few people were at lunch including Roblox CEO David Baszucki and I remember him asking many questions about my thoughts about the engines and rendering, and distinctly remember not finishing most of my lunch because I talked most of the time. However I don’t really remember what was going through my head in regards to my perception of Roblox - why did I join besides just thinking I want to do something else for a change? Who knows, but I am glad I did.</p>

<p>I don’t really understand why Roblox is so successful - you can invent all sorts of reasons in retrospect but it’s hard to validate them, and if you came to anybody back in 2012 and asked for an investment to build a platform where all games are user generated and run on a custom engine with a custom toolset and all users participate in a giant virtual economy and …, I think you’d have gotten a blank stare.</p>

<p>But I do understand that I found the perfect place for me, especially at that point in my career - I enjoy working on game technology but I never liked working on actual games, and Roblox maximizes the number of developers who can use the technology you work on while maintaining a good autonomy and a very wide range of problems you’d need to solve. It’s very hard to get bored here.</p>

<p>I think I could talk for hours about Roblox - it somehow became a huge part of my life. I was very fortunate to join at the time when I did and witness the growth of our technology and business. I am really unsure of what the future holds but it’s hard to imagine what, if anything, comes after Roblox - I certainly don’t intend to leave any time soon…</p>

<p>So I thought it might be fun to do what I’ve planned to do for a year or more now, and to go over all decently sized projects I’ve ever worked on at Roblox. This is based on resummarizing and reliving the source control history, which tells me I’ve had 2752 changes that made it to our main branch, with merge commits counting as one, so, uh, this blog might be on a larger side. Hopefully this will be fun!</p>

<p>Before we begin, I just want to conclude this by saying that I’m very grateful to the Roblox leadership for treating me well, for all the friends and colleagues I made along the way, and for the wonderful Roblox community. The reason why I still enjoy what I do is because whenever I write about a new big thing I’m working on or a small feature or even a bug fix, it’s usually met with excitement which keeps me going. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart. I don’t think I could have done it without you and I hope this continues for as long as possible despite the current trying and uncertain times.</p>



<p>Notably including half-pixel offset fixes for Direct3D9 which I guess is a rite of passage for rendering engineers. The rendering code back then was based on OGRE rendering engine, so I had to learn that, and this was also my first time using OpenGL professionally - prior to that I’ve used Direct3D 9 and proprietary console APIs, and Direct3D 10/11 as a hobby.</p>



<p>Initially added for “100 player” project, in October it evolved to render all parts and continued to be used as part renderer until the introduction of instancing in 2018. Otherwise known as “featherweight parts”. This was further optimized and deployed around November 2012. Most of this code survived to this day but evolved over time, and is still used when instancing doesn’t apply.</p>

<p>The core idea in this system was to dynamically batch meshes together, for characters this would be based on the character model hierarchy, and for everything else the grouping is spatial. This allowed us to reduce the number of draw calls, which was a big concern due to both driver overhead and inefficiencies in OGRE.</p>

<p>This would pave the way for what eventually turned out to be a complete, but gradual, rewrite of the rendering stack. The main motivation for this was always performance - what we ended up let us port to mobile (the old rendering code was nowhere near fast enough even for relatively simple scenes), and break new grounds on the number of objects we could render in a frame.</p>



<p>One of a few OGRE upgrades we’ve needed to do, this one was to get better GLES support. It was pretty painful to do those, just like any other big middleware update is. Read further to learn what happened to OGRE eventually…</p>

<p>One thing I remember from doing these is that documentation in source code makes the upgrade process that much more painful. I had scripts that changed the copyright years in headers back to whatever they were in our tree just to make merging less painful, but there was some OGRE upgrade where 70% of the changes were documentation, and this was very hard to get through.</p>

<p>The reason why these were challenging in general is that whenever we did an upgrade we had to a) merge our plentiful changes with the new code, b) gate dangerous parts of the upgrade with flags. We’ve used the same system of feature flags (we call them fast flags) since I joined Roblox which allows us to dynamically disable parts of the release based on metrics, but this requires actually isolating changes behind if statements selectively - which for OGRE was sometimes necessary as we didn’t know what the impact of some low level change in OpenGL code would be.</p>



<p>Before this we had hand-translated shaders, which started to be painful to maintain. The first version of the pipeline used hlsl2glsl and glsl-optimizer (same as Unity back in the day). We are using version 3 today, see below!</p>

<p>Since this was done at the point where we used OGRE, the compiler would take HLSL files, preprocess and translate them to optimized GLSL, and save the resulting GLSL back to disk - which would then be loaded by OGRE directly through the material definition file. Eventually we replaced this with a binary shader pack that could store GLSL code for OpenGL and shader bytecode for other APIs, but back then we shipped HLSL and GLSL source and compiled HLSL code on device!</p>



<p>Our equivalent of “Steam Hardware Survey” that went through SQL databases and coalesced various system information bits to help us understand the hardware at the time. This was during my era of obsession with F#, so it was written in F# instead of something like Python. We don’t use this anymore and don’t even have the SQL database in question!</p>

<p>We never published the resulting data, and I’m not sure how often we used it to make decisions, but it was fun to look at the number of graphics cards from various vendors or amount of RAM or resolution a typical Roblox user has.</p>



<p>Although I was hired as a rendering engineer, I had a lot of really deep low-level systems experience and as a consequence ended up engaging in both optimization work and security related work from the very beginning. I don’t do this anymore these days but I was often involved in the security work for the first 3 or 4 years. Now we fortunately have people who can do this full time and better than I could :)</p>



<p>A second part of “100 player project”, necessary to render every character in one draw call (these were really expensive for us back in the day!). A side effect included some resolution sacrifices on character items that shirt creators aren’t fond of. The new system managed the atlas texture memory, rebaking humanoids far away to smaller textures to conserve texture memory. The compositor survived with minor changes to this day, although we’re now working on a new one.</p>

<p>The compositor was built in a very configurable fashion, allowing the high level code to specify the layout to bake, and managing all the complex asynchronous processing and budgeting by itself. This allowed us to switch the composit layout completely years later for R15.</p>



<p>At the end of 2012 we were actively working on the mobile port. Since then we’ve had to do a lot of work in a lot of different parts of the engine to make data structures smaller and algorithms - faster. Of course you’re never done with optimizations so we do this to this day. Curiously, our minimum spec on iOS stayed the same since the initial launch in 2012!</p>

<p>A fun fact is that even though we started with iPad 2 as the min. spec we discussed adding support to iPad 1 after launch. At the time there were a lot of people who couldn’t play Roblox on iOS on older hardware. However the performance characteristics of those devices were just… not good enough. You could touch the screen with the finger and pan the camera, and during panning you lost 30% of a single available core to the OS processing the touch. We decided to not add support for this, and 8 years later it seems like a great decision for sure :D</p>



<p>It was very hard to use Xcode Instruments to profile frame spikes on an iPad; to try to figure out how to get our performance to a better place on mobile, I wrote some ad-hoc code to dump all internal log events to a binary stream, and a desktop UI tool in F# and WPF to visualize it. This included a Lua profiler as well that could display profiles of Lua code in a …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p> <span>This post is part of my <a href="https://www.stefanjudis.com/today-i-learned/">Today I learned</a> series in which I share all my learnings regarding web development.</span></p><div><p>While browsing <a href="https://www.stefanjudis.com/notes/1025-shell-command-one-liners-on-one-page/">a collection of shell one-liners</a>, I found out about a command that I haven't seen before: <code>leave</code>.</p><p>The command is straightforward. Run it and define an absolute or relative time, and your terminal will remind you to leave it alone and go at a certain time.</p><pre><code># set the alarm for 2:10pm
$ leave 1410
Alarm set for Fri Nov 20 14:10:00 CET 2020. (pid 3121)

# set the alarm in two minutes
$ leave +2

# set the alarm in two minutes interactively
$ leave
When do you have to leave? +2
Alarm set for Fri Nov 20 09:05:21 CET 2020. (pid 50717)
</code></pre><p>When the time arrives, the command running in the background sends shell notifications and prints new lines telling you to go. And let me tell you the best part: it doesn't do that once; it does that repeatedly every minute after the set alarm time. It will try hard to make you leave!</p><p><strong>You can only stop the running <code>leave</code> process from annoying you by logging out of your shell session (or manually stopping the process).</strong> 😆</p><p>I love that! Maybe I should define <code>leave 1900</code> in my <code>.zshrc</code> to force me to stop doing nerdy things late at night.</p><p><em>Edited:</em> For the adventurous folks – <a href="https://twitter.com/fhemberger/status/1329712452301451264">Frederic Hemberger pointed out</a> that you could also just shut down the system at a specific time using <code>sudo shutdown -h 12:00 "Feierabend!"</code>. But be careful with this command; it could lead to data loss. 😆</p><p>If you're interested in reading comments and alternatives to the <code>leave</code> command, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25158739">this post was trending on Hacker News</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>It’s been nearly three years since the Bitcoin price has reached a benchmark of over $15k and it doesn’t seem to be stopping. But, it’s not just the price of BTC that is overflowing. New Bitcoin addresses have also skyrocketed.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>On November, 18th, one week after Bitcoin broke its 15K boundary, <a href="https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1329045245212971010?s=20">Glassnode</a>, a crypto-analysis company, tweeted an unusually high number of BTC accounts being created.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">In the past hour we observed the highest number of newly created addresses in the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> network since January 2018 📈</p>
<p>Chart: <a href="https://t.co/fTmoH5ezNw">https://t.co/fTmoH5ezNw</a> <a href="https://t.co/INq7sEEtoM">pic.twitter.com/INq7sEEtoM</a></p>
<p>— glassnode (@glassnode) <a href="https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1329045245212971010?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2020</a></p></blockquote>

<p>According to Glassnode, the address per hour rate increased to almost 25,000, a rate not seen since January 2018 when BTC hit $20k.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>To put this number into perceptive, the most Bitcoin address ever created within a 24-hour period was on December 21, 2017 when nearly 600,000 popped up. Will we see this FOMO craze again if <a href="https://coincolony.net/bitcoin-technical-analysis-can-we-see-20k-again/">BTC hits $20k</a> by the end of the year?</p>
<p>We have seen a steady rise in public BTC implementation as well as business incorporation this year. This caused the price of BTC to go from $4k at the beginning of 2020 to $18k currently.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>However, universal usage is still minuscule with as much as <a href="https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2017-04-20-global-cryptocurrency-benchmarking-study.pdf">5.8 million cryptocurrency wallets</a> active in 2017. That equates to less than .1% of the global population own crypto.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>It will be interesting to see the adoption rates increase as the BTC price continues to rise and steady at a price that most people feel comfortable enough to buy, use, and save longterm.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>We’re going to be a bit silly this week (in part because the ending of this compressed semester has left me with little time) and talk about the recently released historical action-RPG computer (and console) game, <em>Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla</em>, set in 9th century Norway and England.</p>



<p>And, as with the last time we did this, I should note that this isn’t a <em>game review</em>.  As a <strong>game</strong>, <em>AC: Valhalla</em> is perfectly serviceable and quite fun.  I don’t think it got the same amount of developer time as its predecessor, <em>Odyssey</em>, but it is also a more focused experience than <em>Odyssey</em> was, which runs to its benefit.  Everything here basically works and while I find some of the game design decisions puzzling (the largest being how long the game makes you wait <em>hours </em>before you have a full set of all three armor types and all weapon types, given that you may be getting bonuses to them in the skill tree many hours before you find <em>any at all</em>), <strong>it is overall fine.  It’s fun.</strong></p>

<p>But you aren’t here for my game reviews. You are here for me to talk about the <em>history</em> behind the game.  And normally, I would leave a product like this alone (this is only thinly historical fiction, given the crazy background plot that ties the games together).  But each <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game includes not just meticulous recreations of historical <em>places</em> (and to be clear, I mean the physical buildings and landscapes, not the cultures or politics, but also some form of this statement:</p>



<blockquote><p>Inspired by historical events and characters, this work of fiction was designed, developed, and produced by a multicultural team of various beliefs, sexual orientations and gender identities.</p></blockquote>



<p>(yes, the odd decision to use and then not use the Oxford comma is preserved from the original).  That is <em>Valhalla’s </em>version of the statement.  <strong>That statement is making a claim about the product that follows</strong>.  Some of those claims are explicit (this is based on real history at some level) and some are implicit (our diverse team means this game was produced in a careful, sensitive way).  <strong>And those claims deserve interrogation.</strong></p>

<h2>The Nitpicks</h2>



<p>My thoughts on <em>Valhalla</em> fit into two main categories: complaints of historical accuracy that I think are largely unimportant, but fun to note, and<strong> complaints about tone and framing which I think <em>are</em> important and worth discussing</strong>.  <strong>We can start with the frivolous stuff</strong>.  If you want to skip to the meat of the analysis, you are welcome to jump right to the next section, but I know some folks like to know about this stuff, so here it is.</p>



<p><strong>First off, because it is a core area of my specialty: the weapons and armor.  </strong>The military equipment we see here is very hit-or-miss and<strong> there are honestly quite a lot of misses</strong>.  They at least have, for the most part, the relatively light design of battle axes correct, in both their two-handed and one-handed varieties.  And I can understand from a game design standpoint the decision to not give the player a one-handed sword and to instead fill that role with the more iconic one-handed axe; NPCs use one-handed swords, so it isn’t that they don’t exist, merely that our character doesn’t prefer them.  Technically, sword-and-shield and spear-and-shield are both possible, but only with a high level perk, which is pretty silly given that these were the most common non-elite fighting styles of the era by some distance.</p>



<p>But things go poorly from there.  There is a ‘flail’ type weapon, despite – <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/06/07/collections-the-siege-of-gondor-part-v-just-flailing-about-flails/">as we’ve discussed</a>, actually – flail chain weapons being both not of this period, poorly attested in general and also not common in this part of the world in <em>any </em>period.  The large two-handed swords – the only kinds of swords the player can use – are around <em>three hundred</em> years too early and don’t really resemble their later variations either (they are much too thick and heavy, being mostly up-scaled period swords, which makes them look absurd).  And yes, there were two-handed swords in antiquity in Thrace and Illyria (the falx and rhomphaia) but this is both not that part of the world, not antiquity, and these are not those swords.  I am befuddled that, with two other two-handed weapons that fit the period (a thrusting spear and a two-handed axe) that they felt the need to include ‘greatswords.’  Also, they are carried by way of back-scabbards, which…sigh…no.</p>



<p><strong>The armor is generally a bigger ‘miss’ than the weapons.</strong>  There is a <em>lot</em> of soft ‘leather’ armor here of exactly the sort that was not used historically.  What is baffling uncommon is <em>mail</em> – especially among the Norse and Danes (there’s a bit more mail on the Saxons) –  which would have been, in this period, by far the most common metal body protection.  Pretty much all of Eivor’s warrior band ought to be wearing mail.  Instead, there is a lot of scale armor; scale was certainly used in this period in England, but it was a lot less common than mail (there are also things like brigandine armor roughly 400 years too early).  I have noticed a real trend of game developers using lots of scale armor when mail would be more correct; I wonder if it is easier for an art-team to produce the assets for it or if they think it looks cooler.  But in any event, audiences looking for a realistic sweep of ninth century equipment will not find it here.  I would say, for the more ‘exotic’ player armors, that I think the developers here missed a trick – the game sets up early that we have people from the Near East and even the Far East in the player’s clan.  I think that would set up an opportunity to have the honestly rather more varied and potentially visually interesting armors from the Near East – a lot more scale, but also Near Eastern lamellar or even Chinese-style lamellar coats.  Alas, no.</p>

Even vikings <strong>cared</strong> about their appearances!</figcaption></figure>



<p>In terms of <em>clothing</em>, it is both hit and miss, but a bit more hit than miss compared to equipment.  Some of the Norse and Danish wear is ‘hollywood barbarian’ (lots of rough fur, inexplicably low-coverage clothing in freezing climates, lots of random leather) which remains truly frustrating.  But <em>most</em> of the clothing isn’t this way.  One odd area is color: <strong>medieval clothing, contrary to what you often see in films, was <em>colorful</em>, often with lots of bold primary colors</strong> (bright reds, yellows, greens, blues).  In <em>Valhalla</em>, the developers have opted to use clothing color to signify faction (friendly Danes wear green, the Norse blue, hostile Danes red, hostile Saxons yellow) and to keep non-combatants in drab colors.  I get the design reason (they want you to pay attention to enemies, not non-combatants) but it is frustrating, apart from the monks, that this makes so many of the townsfolk drab and dull.  <strong>Still, it was very nice to see Norse and Danes in bright primary colors, often with lovely border-stitching on their clothes and lots of clear care.</strong></p>



<p>In terms of architecture, I very much like that buildings in settlements, especially high status ones, are often well built, with lots of designs and carving work in the wood.  I am less thrilled with the way churches are done: typically in plain stone with plaster; some color is often added by lighting effects through stained glass.  But these are medieval Catholic churches, they should be brightly painted and colored in the interior and in most cases – <em>especially</em> in big towns and monasteries – very well kept up.  If you want to see this done better, <strong><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em> is a deeply flawed game that nevertheless does medieval town architecture and clothing quite a lot better</strong> (but maybe watch a Let’s Play; while <em>KC:D </em>is fun once it gets properly going, it’s a case where I don’t think the juice is worth the squeeze; I invested the time to get properly into the game and I don’t think it was really worth it).</p>

<h2>Diversity</h2>



<p>This isn’t really a nitpick or a substantive issue, so I am giving it its own section in between the two.  Let me be frank: <strong>I fully understand the desire of the developers to deviate from history on some of these points in order to make a more inclusive game</strong>.  These games do not market themselves as pure historical simulations, so this does not bother me; in fact I think it is broadly a positive thing that game studios are doing this (so long as they are <em>open</em> about fudging the history).  So if you were hoping for a lot of table-pounding here, you are bound to be disappointed.  Still, we’re assessing the game historically, so it seems worthwhile to point some of these things out.</p>



<p>First, on gender diversity, so far the game has built up a quiet contrast between the English, who are gender-stratified, and the Norse and Danes, who are much less so.  Saxon troopers are all male, but Danish and Norse NPCs include women.  All of the Saxon leaders I’ve met so far in the game are male, while one of the first jarls you meet in England is a woman ruling in her own name.  Saxon clothing is sharply gendered (men in pants, women in dresses), but Norse and Danish clothing generally isn’t (which is a clear design choice, since this is very much <em>not</em> true historically).  And, as with <em>AC: Odyssey</em>, if you play a female main character, absolutely no one seems to care or notice.</p>



<p>Now, on the one hand, there isn’t <em>nothing</em> to this characterization.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shield-maiden">‘Shield-maidens’</a> do show up in the …</p></div></div>

She has written ten books, both fiction and nonfiction. Here she discusses the relationship between science and philosophy, the nature of philosophical progress, Gödel’s theorems, Incompleteness, Einstein, Realism and postmodernism, Gödel and Wittgenstein, Spinoza, Spinoza and his appeal to imaginative writers, the Spinoza War, and Moby Dick.</p><p><strong>3:16:</strong> What made you become a philosopher?</p><p><strong>Rebecca Newberger Goldstein</strong> <strong>:</strong>&nbsp; I started out mostly interested in math and physics. There were problems that obsessed me in both fields—How can math be <em>a priori</em>? How can quantum mechanics be connected to a reality that is recognizably our own? I discovered, while in college, that these were actually philosophical problems. My senior year in college I went to speak to one of my professors, Sidney Morgenbesser, an amazing guy. He was the Socrates of his day. Socrates never published anything, but instead engaged in deeply probing dialogues. That was Sidney’s m.o. as well. Over the course of several long conversations Sidney convinced me that I was a philosopher, rather than a scientist. His clinching argument was that scientists are like the bourgeoisie, never questioning the system, whereas philosophers were like socialists, always examining the system critically: even if it seemed to be working, <em>ought</em> it to be working? That argument struck home. I basically applied to graduate school in philosophy on the strength of Sidney’s metaphor.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://static.s123-cdn.com/uploads/2029468/2000_5fb4ed28d1e2b.png"></p><p><strong>3:16:</strong> In your book <u>‘<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00KEW8KC4/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i1">Plato at the Googleplex</a>’ y</u>ou have Plato brought into our century to discuss philosophy with our contemporaries. So first, can you say what you take philosophy to be and why you think it hasn’t gone away and isn’t going away soon?</p><p><strong>RNG:</strong> I think that philosophy is the systematic and rigorous investigation of one of the deepest urges that we humans have, which is the urge to get our bearings in the most general sense possible. In particular, (1) We want to know where we are. What is the nature of this universe in which we find ourselves? What fundamentally different kinds of things, belonging to different ontological categories, are there, and how do they operate? 2. We want to know our own place in the universe, whether we’re made of the same stuff, are a special category of being, and whether the universe itself has any attitudes towards us. 3. We want to know what we are meant to do with our lives. We want to know what it is to live a life worthy for a human to live, a good life.&nbsp;</p><p>The first two questions are ontological, the third is normative. Science, as it eventually developed, has the lead role in answering the ontological questions, but science is often pushed on by philosophy, in its critical probing role. And the more subtle the science becomes, the bigger the role for philosophy, since it falls to philosophy’s special techniques to figure out what is and isn’t entailed by the science. For example, what changes are we required to make to our concept of time in light of Relativity Theory? And as far as the normative questions go, there the ball falls squarely in philosophy’s court, though it’s sometimes advancements in science and technology that generate the balls, that is, new normative questions.&nbsp;</p><p>Consider the normative questions generated by advances in AI, or the question of what obligations we have to future generations, given the threat of climate change. As long as science and technology advance, philosophers will have new questions to work on.</p><p><strong>3:16:</strong>&nbsp; You place Plato in rooms having philosophical debates with all sorts of people but you never have him decisively concluding a debate or argument. For those hostile to philosophy this might be a hostage to fortune – it suggests that philosophy can’t decide anything and actually we would be better off listening to scientists, historians and novelists. Why should we heed the philosopher in our time if not even Plato can answer its questions? What do you say to those physicists who say philosophy is just pointless and has been supplanted by – well, in their case – physics?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RNG:</strong> When it comes to ontology, I would argue that it’s science that plays the leading role. But I’d have to offer a philosophical argument to support that conclusion. I'd first have to both differentiate what is essential to science, how it differs from other fields of inquiry, including philosophy, and I’d have to argue for scientific realism, that is argue that science is in the business of ontology. Both of those are conclusions that can’t be empirically established, i.e. they are philosophical. So one can’t even make the case for science, ontologically speaking, without engaging in philosophy. And as far as the normative questions go, we are entirely in the philosophical sphere. And here I do think philosophy has offered us answers, answers which have as fundamentally changed our lives, and for the better, as the technological advances that science has given us.&nbsp;</p><p>As just one example, consider the idea of human rights. One of my points in my having Plato engage in those philosophical dialogues in which it’s not he who supplies the answer, but instead he is rather surprised by being philosophically instructed by some “regular” people, was to demonstrate the progress we’ve made since Plato, progress that has been disseminated and seeped into the points of view of non-philosophers. In the first dialogue a rather down-to-earth character, a media escort, explains to Plato in very commonsensical terms why slavery is wrong. Plato had argued that it’s wrong for Greeks to enslave other Greeks, which was an advance over the norm taken for granted by his society, but he never universalized the conclusion. Nor did Aristotle, who argued that some people are naturally suited to be slaves. So if I don’t have Plato having all the answers it’s often to show progress made in the millennia since he lived, or to show that our new conditions, many of them created by scientific and technological advances, generate new philosophical problems--in other words to show that philosophy will never go away. My showing Plato to be often instructed and/or stumped is meant to challenge the view that philosophy remains static.</p><p><strong>3:16:</strong>&nbsp; So this leads to one of the issues you raise in the book - the notion of philosophical progress. So what do you take to be the progress philosophy has made since Plato and why is it invisible to many, unlike science?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RNG:</strong> Philosophical advances in epistemology and in ethics profoundly shape our points of view. We don’t see them precisely because we see with them. It’s like the fish who responds to the question “How’s the water today?” with “Water? What’s water?” When people hold the view, for example, that science has discovered that simultaneity is not absolute, as counter-intuitive as that seems, or that chattel slavery is an abomination, which once also had seemed counter-intuitive, they don’t realize the laborious philosophical reasoning that had laid the groundwork for their views. It takes philosophical work to claim that science can correct our fundamental views of the way the world is. It takes philosophical work to claim that we can discover, without consulting any holy books (that in fact sanction slavery), truths about the way humans can and can’t be treated. Philosophy is committed to the view that we can use human reason to come to ethical conclusions, overcoming biases, tradition, and religious authority. Just the other week the Pope gave his approval to civil unions for gay people. That is the slow progress of the philosophical idea of human rights working its way out. You could even consider such changes in ethical attitudes, eventually making their way even to the Vatican, as philosophy’s own technological products, the practical application of philosophical conclusions, analogous to the technological goodies that have come from science. In fact, you can even regard science itself as one of philosophy’s technological products, the practical application of certain epistemological conclusions.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://static.s123-cdn.com/uploads/2029468/2000_5fb4edb79cae4.png"></p><p><strong>3:16:</strong>&nbsp; You’ve written about <u><em>Gödel</em></u><a href="http://www.bookdepository.com/Incompleteness-Rebecca-Goldstein/9780393327601?ref=grid-view&amp;qid=1605692840648&amp;sr=1-1"><u><em>’s incompleteness theorems</em></u></a>. …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div>

  <div>
    
    <p>If you’re reading this post on my new LoneStar Electronics MMDVM hotspot, then you no doubt decided to explore the option of buiding one yourself after noting the price of some of the commercially available hotspots. For example the Zumspot form Ham Radio Outlet retails between $150 - $160, and that’s not including a case to safeguard it. And let’s not forget about BridgeCom Systems who absolutely rape you on the price of their SkyBridge Hotspot; $299 is rip off.</p>
<p>So, “What did you build and what did it cost?” you ask. I built a simple small form MMDVM hotspot using the LoneStar MMDVM Simplex Board. Combined cost for the build is $140, and if you want the OLED screen you can add on another $10 for a total $150. Now before you start complaining there are Jumbospots on eBay for $75, let me remind you that those are made from questionable components. If you want to purchase one of these, fine but don’t be surprised if it underperforms or completely dies on you. That’s the price you pay for not paying full price.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Before we dive into the build, allow me give you a little background of my motivations behind this project and my requirements. To begin with, I believe the cost of commercially available hotspots is too high provided the quality of components used. Second, I didn’t like any of the available options on the market.</p>
<p>I think the OLED screen that’s attached to most MMDVM boards is ridiculously small. During my research on hotspot cases, I came across the line of cases from C4Labs with either 2.4” or 3.5” Nextion screens. This intrigued me because they are so much bigger than the OLED screens attached to the MMDVM boards. Bigger is better right?! Well… it turns out the screen is just a novelty and doesn’t provide any functionally beyond displaying which room/reflector/talkgroup you’re connected to and the callsign of the current person speaking. My Yaseu FT3D already does this for me. I asked around and couldn’t find anyone who thought it was a must have feature. Knowing this, I decided that I didn’t need either the OLED or Nextion screen. However, I still want the option to attach a screen to my hotspot should I change my mind in the future.</p>
<p>One of the biggest complaints against hotspots is the accusation that it isn’t real ham radio because most users operate them within ten feet of themselves. Personally I don’t care what you’re opinion on this topic is, the fact of the mater is that I’m going to be within ten feet of my hotspot when I employ it. With such limited distances between the users and their hotspot, I challenge the need for SMA connectors attached to the MMDVM board. The connectors are just soldered onto the board with nothing more to secure them in place. Luckily the MMDVM board I want to use comes with a ceramic antenna surface mounted onto the board. No need for me to worry about breaking the solder joints on a SMA connector.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, let’s move onto the parts utilized for this build.</p>
<h2 id="parts-list">Parts List</h2>

</figure>

<p>The most essential component of a hotspot is the MMDVM board. I want the most superior performance and quality for my hotspot, so I don’t want to compromise by buying a cheap MMDVM board. The LoneStar MMDVM Simplex Board, designed by N5BOC David Dennis, is considerable more expensive than other MMDVM boards, however it’s constructed of higher-quality components and has the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has its own dedicated 3.3V regulator and does not pull voltage off of the noisy Raspberry Pi 3.3V line like all other simplex board do.</li>
<li>The board is a four layer PCB with large ground planes for 3.3V and GND sandwiched in the middle of the PCB. This acts as one very large decoupling cap the size of the entire board. Also this isolates signals between top side and bottom side.</li>
<li>All of the Analog RF signals are on the top side only and the high harmonic digital signals are all kept isolated on the bottom side. Making this board much more stable. It should also make it more sensitive on receive.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c4labs-jrz-1s-case">C4Labs JRZ-1S Case</h3>
<figure>

</figure>

<p>I like this case; it’s modest yet does the job very well once it’s completely together. As an added touch of class, I went with the wood inlays. I also sanded the sides of the case with 400 grit sandpaper to give it that frosted glass look. I appreciate how it turned out. The actual case is engineered very well with the components fitting in securely inside. Interestingly enough one layer of the case does include holes drilled in it to support the prongs of an SMA connector. It’s a thoughtful touch, but I’m keenly uninterested in trying to find out how well they work.</p>
<h3 id="raspberry-pi-zero-wh">Raspberry Pi Zero WH</h3>

</figure>

<p>Nothing extremely exceptional about this other than I purchased it from Adafruit. I went with the Zero WH instead of the Zero W, because I don’t know how to solder very well and didn’t want to ruin the thing. One of these days I need to force myself to learn and become better.</p>
<h2 id="the-finished-build">The Finished Build</h2>

</figure>

<p>Here’s the finished hotspot. If you look in the top right-hand corner above the heatsink, you’ll recognize the ceramic antenna. With the hotspot located in my basement, I’m nevertheless able to connect to it will my Yaesu FT3D running 300 mW. Should I want to ever want to attach a screen I can because there are connections present for the Nextion and OLED displays. The only gripe I have remains the location of the micro-USB port on the Pi Zero. If you couldn’t determine from the photo the case is upside down. Well, I can’t do anything about that so, I’ll have to live with it. Overall I’m impressed with the build quality of the hotspot and look forward to using it for years to come.</p>

            <!-- content --><p>ZFS has become increasingly popular in recent years. ZFS on Linux (ZoL) has pushed the envelope and exposed many newcomers to the ZFS fold. iXsystems has adopted the newer codebase, now called <strong>OpenZFS, </strong>into its codebase for TrueNAS CORE. The purpose of this article is to help those of you who have heard about ZFS but have not yet had the opportunity to research it.</p>
<p>Our hope is that we leave you with a better understanding of how and why it works the way it does. Knowledge is key to the decision-making process, and we feel that ZFS is something worth considering for most organizations.<br>
<span id="more-44288"></span></p>
<h2>What is ZFS?</h2>
<p>ZFS is a <strong>filesystem</strong>, but unlike most other file systems it is also the <strong>logical volume manager</strong> or LVM. What that means is ZFS directly controls not only how the bits and blocks of your files are stored on your hard drives, but it also controls how your hard drives are logically arranged for the purposes of RAID and redundancy. ZFS is also classified as a <strong>copy-on-write</strong> or <a href="https://www.ixsystems.com/documentation/freenas/11.2/zfsprimer.html">COW filesystem</a>. This means that ZFS can do some cool things like <strong>snapshots</strong> that a normal filesystem like NTFS could not. A snapshot can be thought of like it sounds, a photograph of how something was at a point in time. How a COW filesystem works, however, has some important implications that we need to discuss.</p>
<figure id="attachment_44997" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-44997"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Openzfs.svg_-322x300.png" alt="The Open ZFS Logo" width="322" height="300" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Openzfs.svg_-322x300.png 322w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Openzfs.svg_-800x746.png 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Openzfs.svg_-696x649.png 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Openzfs.svg_-450x420.png 450w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Openzfs.svg_.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-44997">The Open ZFS Logo</figcaption></figure>
<p>Hard Drives work such that the pieces of your data are stored in <strong>Logical Block Addresses</strong>, or LBAs. ZFS is aware of what LBAs a specific file is stored in. Let us say we need to write a file that is big enough to fit into 3 blocks. We are going to store that file in LBA 1000, 1001, and 1002. This is considered a sequential write, as all of these blocks are stored directly next to each other. For spinning hard drives, this is ideal, as the write head does not have to move off of the track it is on.</p>
<figure id="attachment_23424" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-23424"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/western-digital-red-pro-10tb-nas-hdd-review/wd-red-10tb-pro-nas-top/" rel="attachment wp-att-23424"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/WD-Red-10TB-Pro-NAS-Top.jpg" alt="WD Red 10TB Pro NAS Top" width="800" height="786" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/WD-Red-10TB-Pro-NAS-Top.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/WD-Red-10TB-Pro-NAS-Top-305x300.jpg 305w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/WD-Red-10TB-Pro-NAS-Top-696x684.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/WD-Red-10TB-Pro-NAS-Top-427x420.jpg 427w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-23424">WD Red 10TB Pro NAS Top <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/wd-red-smr-vs-cmr-tested-avoid-red-smr/">Use CMR with ZFS, not SMR</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, let us say we make a change to the file and the part that was stored at LBA 1001 needs to be modified. When we write that change, ZFS does not over-write the part of the file that was stored in 1001. Instead, it will write that block to LBA 2001. LBA 1001 will be kept as-is until the snapshot keeping it there expires. This allows us to have both the current version of the file, and the previous one, while <em>only storing the difference.</em> However, the next time we go to read the file back, the read head of our spinning hard drive needs to read LBA 1000, go to the track where LBA 2001 is stored, read that, and then go back to the track where LBA 1002 is stored. This phenomenon is called <strong>fragmentation.</strong></p>
<h2>A Primer on ZFS Pool Design</h2>
<p>To make ZFS pools easier to understand, we are going to focus on using small storage containers as you may have around the house or shop. Before we continue, it is worth defining some terms. A <strong>VDEV, </strong>or virtual device, is a logical grouping of one or more storage devices. A <strong>pool</strong> is then a logically defined group built from 1 or more VDEVs. ZFS is very customizable, and therefore, there are many different types of configurations for VDEVs. You can think of the construction of a ZFS pool by visualizing the following graphic:</p>
<figure id="attachment_45011" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45011"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-800x521.jpg" alt="Nested Storage Containers" width="696" height="453" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-800x521.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-400x261.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-1536x1001.jpg 1536w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-2048x1334.jpg 2048w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-696x453.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-1068x696.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-645x420.jpg 645w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-45011">Nested Storage Containers</figcaption></figure>
<p>Starting from the smallest container size, we have our drives. We can see that in this visualization we have two drives in each larger container. These two larger containers are our VDEVs. The single largest container, then, is our pool. In this configuration, we would have each pair of drives in a <strong>mirror. </strong>This means that one drive can fail in either (or both!) VDEV and the pool would continue to function in a <strong>degraded</strong> state.</p>
<figure id="attachment_45012" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45012"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-800x538.jpg" alt="Two Mirrors, Each VDEV with One Bad Drive" width="696" height="468" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-800x538.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-400x269.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-1536x1034.jpg 1536w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-2048x1378.jpg 2048w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-696x468.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-1068x719.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-624x420.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-45012">Two Mirrors, Each VDEV with One Bad Drive</figcaption></figure>
<p>However, if 2 drives in a <strong>single</strong> VDEV, all of the data in our entire pool is lost. There is no redundancy of the pool itself, all redundancy in ZFS is in the VDEV layer. If one <em>VDEV</em> fails, there is not enough information to rebuild the missing data.</p>
<figure id="attachment_45013" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45013"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-failed-800x559.jpg" alt="Two Mirrors, One VDEV where Both Drives Failed" width="696" height="486" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-failed-800x559.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-failed-400x280.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-failed-1536x1074.jpg 1536w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-failed-696x487.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-failed-1068x747.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-failed-601x420.jpg 601w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-failed-100x70.jpg 100w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-With-Two-Bad-Drives-failed.jpg 1991w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-45013">Two Mirrors, One VDEV where Both Drives Failed</figcaption></figure>
<p>Next, we need to define what&nbsp;<strong>RAID-Z</strong> is and what the various levels of RAID-Z are. RAID-Z is a way of putting multiple drives together into a VDEV and storing <strong>parity,&nbsp;</strong>or fault tolerance. In ZFS, there is no dedicated “parity drive” like in&nbsp;<strong>Unraid</strong>, but it instead stores parity across all of the drives in the VDEV.&nbsp; The amount of parity that is spread across the drives determines the level of RAID-Z. It is in this way more similar to traditional hardware RAID.</p>
<p>What can make RAID-Z a better approach than a mirrored configuration is that it does not matter <em>what&nbsp;</em>drive fails in a RAID-Z. Each drive is an equal partner, whereas, in a mirrored configuration, each mirrored VDEV is a separate entity. This benefit of RAID-Z comes at the cost of performance, however, and a mirrored pool will almost always be <em>faster</em>&nbsp;than RAID Z.</p>
<p><strong>RAID-Z</strong>&nbsp;is similar to a traditional&nbsp;<strong>RAID 5. </strong>In RAID-Z you have one drive worth of parity. In other words, if you lose one drive, your pool will continue to function. For RAID-Z you need a minimum of 3 drives per VDEV. You can have 3, 7, or even 12 drives in a RAID-Z VDEV. The more drives which you add, however, the longer it will take to <strong>resilver,&nbsp;</strong>or rebuild.</p>
<p>This increased time increases the risk of your data, as a second drive failure during this process would destroy your pool. ZFS will resilver while the data is still in use, it is a live recovery. The implication of this is that our disks are working harder than usual during this process, and this can increase the chances of a second drive failure. Your data is still accessible and in production, while it is reading all of the parity data from the existing members of your VDEV and then writing it to the new disk.</p>

<p>A RAID-Z2 VDEV is more akin to a RAID 6. In this configuration, 2 drives worth of parity is stored across all of your devices. You can lose up to two drives per VDEV and your pool will still function. Adding more parity drives increases calculations required which means you need more processing performance to operate the array.</p>

<p>Finally, a RAID-Z3 VDEV provides three drives worth of parity, so you can lose up to three drives per VDEV and your pool will still function. <strong>The more drives of parity you add, however, the slower your performance ends up being</strong>. You need a minimum of four but should use at least five drives to build a RAID-Z3 VDEV.</p>
<h2>The Need for Speed</h2>
<p>There are two ways in which we measure speed or <em>fastness</em>,&nbsp;<strong>IOPS,</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Throughput</strong>. In RAIDZ, more drives will give you more throughput, or the actual read and write speed you see when transferring files. However, if you have ever tried to run multiple file copies in Windows simultaneously, you may have noticed the more you do, the slower it gets. It does not always get slower at a constant rate, the more you try to do disks will get exponentially slower. This is because your disk can only do so many Input/Output Operations per Second, or IOPS.</p>
<p>RAIDZ will scale in&nbsp;<em>throughput</em>&nbsp;with the more disks you add, but it does not scale with&nbsp;<em>IOPS.</em> What that generally means is, RAIDZ is not traditionally the best choice for I/O intensive workloads, as the amount of IOPS is roughly limited to the slowest member of our VDEV if we exclude all of the caching ZFS has. Virtualization, as we are discussing here, is highly dependent on I/O.</p>
<p>Earlier, we discussed that ZFS is a COW filesystem, and because of that it suffers from data fragmentation. There are direct performance implications that stem from that fact.&nbsp;<strong>The more “full” your pool is, the slower it will ultimately get.&nbsp;</strong>Write speeds in ZFS are directly tied to the amount of&nbsp;<em>adjacent</em> free blocks there are to write to. As your pool fills up, and as data fragments, there are fewer and fewer blocks that are directly adjacent to one another. A single large file may span blocks scattered all over the surface of your hard drive. Even though you would expect that file to be a sequential write, it no longer can be if your drive is full.</p>
<figure id="attachment_45006" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45006"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Seagate-Mobile-HDD-Crystale-DIsk-Mark.png" alt="Seagate Mobile HDD Crystal Disk Mark Performance" width="482" height="351" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Seagate-Mobile-HDD-Crystale-DIsk-Mark.png 482w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Seagate-Mobile-HDD-Crystale-DIsk-Mark-400x291.png 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Seagate-Mobile-HDD-Crystale-DIsk-Mark-324x235.png 324w" sizes="(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-45006">Seagate Mobile HDD Crystal Disk Mark Performance</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the above graphic, we can see a Seagate 1TB mobile drive that I tested in CrystalDiskMark. It can do about 130 MB/s of sequential read and writes. We can also see that when we start doing random 4k I/O, the speed falls about <strong>100x</strong>. This is meant to illustrate the performance impact of data fragmentation. Additionally, we can see that the latency for these lookups can take about&nbsp;<strong>half of a second, </strong>and we are limited to about 350 IOPS. In order to be fast, virtualization workloads on traditional hard drives need to have many disks in order to compensate for this slowness. It would not be uncommon to see a pool constructed of 10 or more VDEVs of mirrored drives.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is some wisdom we can <a href="https://www.ixsystems.com/community/threads/the-path-to-success-for-block-storage.81165">borrow from the ZFS community</a>. As your pool fills up, and sequential writes become increasingly difficult to accomplish due to fragmentation, it will slow down in a non-linear way. As a general rule of thumb, at about 50% capacity your pool will be noticeably slower than it was when it was 10% capacity. At about 80%-96% capacity, your pool starts to become very slow, and ZFS will actually change its write algorithm to ensure data integrity, further slowing you down.</p>
<p>This is where SSDs come in. They radically change the game because they work very differently at the physical layer. They do not have read and write heads that are flying around a spinning disk back and forth trying to find your data. With the physical limitations of disk-based drives out of the way, SSDs can read and write non-sequential data <em>much&nbsp;</em>faster. They do not suffer the penalties of these rules nearly as severely, fragmentation does not hurt their performance to the same degree.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Storing authenticated and encrypted data on <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a> is a core building block for many Web3 applications, but to date there has not been a standardized way to encode this type of data.</p><p>Without a standard, many developers have been forced to create custom formats for their signed and encrypted data. This has been prohibitive to the openness and interoperability of information stored in IPFS by siloing data to their particular implementation. Another approach to authenticated data has been to put data in IPFS and put the CID of the data in a smart contract on a blockchain, such as <a href="https://ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a>. This is essentially an expensive way of adding a signature on top of the data and persisting the signature record on the blockchain.</p><p>With the introduction of <strong><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2844">EIP-2844</a>,</strong> a standard that allows wallets to support a few new methods for signing and decrypting data based on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> and the <strong><a href="https://github.com/ipld/specs/pull/269"><code>dag-jose</code></a></strong> IPLD codec, we can now simply put authenticated and encrypted data directly into IPFS. In this tutorial, you will learn how you can utilize these primitives with two libraries, <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-did"><code>js-did</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/3box/3id-connect"><code>3ID Connect</code></a>!</p><h2 id="what-are-dids-and-jose">What are DIDs and JOSE?</h2><p><strong>DIDs</strong> is the W3C standard for <em>Decentralized Identifiers</em>. It specifies a general way of going from a string identifier, e.g. <code>did:3:bafy...</code>, to a <em>DID document</em> which contains public keys for signature verification and key exchange. In most DID methods the document can be updated when keys are rotated for security reasons.</p><p><strong>JOSE</strong> is a standard from <a href="https://www.ietf.org/standards/">IETF</a> which stands for <em>JSON Object Signing and Encryption,</em> and that pretty much explains what it is. There are two main primitives in this standard: JWS (JSON Web Signatures) and JWE (JSON Web Encryption). Both of these formats allow for multiple participants: in JWS there can be one or multiple signatures over the payload, and in JWE there might be one or multiple recipients for the encrypted cleartext.</p><h2 id="building-with-dag-jose-and-eip2844">Building with dag-jose and EIP2844</h2><p>As we have been building out <a href="https://ceramic.network/">Ceramic</a> with <strong>dag-jose</strong> and <strong>EIP-2844</strong> as basic building blocks, we've created a few lower-level tools which allow us to more easily use these technologies. This tutorial will show you how to use these powerful tools directly.</p><p><strong><a href="https://github.com/3box/identity-wallet-js/">IdentityWallet</a></strong> is an implementation of <strong>EIP-2844</strong> using 3ID as the DID method. It can be used standalone as a <em>DID Provider,</em> or more conveniently within the <strong><a href="https://github.com/3box/3id-connect/">3ID Connect</a></strong> library. 3ID Connect allows users to use their Ethereum wallet (support for more blockchains coming soon) to get access to a <em>DID Provider</em>.</p><p><strong><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-did">js-did</a></strong> is a library that allows developers to represent a user in the form of a DID. This is the main interface we're going to be looking at in this tutorial. It allows us to sign data with the currently authenticated user, encrypt data to any user (DID), and decrypt data with the currently authenticated user.</p><h2 id="signed-data-in-ipfs">Signed data in IPFS</h2><p>By using the <strong>dag-jose</strong> IPLD codec we can create data structures that are linked and signed. This is done by creating JSON Web Signatures (JWS) that contain a link to additional data. One of the main problems that the <strong>dag-jose</strong> codec solves is that the payload of a JWS is traditionally encoded as <code>base64url</code> which means that if it contains any IPLD links you can't traverse those links. Instead what we do with <em>DagJWS</em> is enforce the payload to be the bytes of a CID. The codec then transforms the payload into a CID instance and sets it to the <code>link</code> property of the <em>DagJWS. </em>This allows us to easily traverse the resulting DAG.</p><h2 id="setup-your-environment">Setup your environment</h2><p>This section will cover how to set up some specific dependencies needed for this tutorial. If you just want to skip the setup part we have prepared <a href="https://ceramicstudio.github.io/web-playground/">a simple playground</a> which bundles ipfs, 3id-connect, and dids. You can use it by opening the web page, clicking on connect, then opening the developer console where you can run the commands. If you decide to do so, skip the following two sections.</p><h3 id="setup-ipfs-with-dag-jose-support">Setup IPFS with dag-jose support</h3><p>Since dag-jose is a new IPLD codec it's not yet included in js-ipfs by default. It also implements the new IPLD codec API which is also not supported by js-ipfs yet. Therefore we need to do the following when we are creating an instance of IPFS:</p><pre><code>import IPFS from 'ipfs'
import dagJose from 'dag-jose'
import multiformats from 'multiformats/basics'
import legacy from 'multiformats/legacy'

multiformats.multicodec.add(dagJose)
const dagJoseFormat = legacy(multiformats, dagJose.name)

const ipfs = await Ipfs.create({ ipld: { formats: [dagJoseFormat] } })
</code></pre><p>Make sure to install the correct version of multiformats:</p><pre><code>$ npm i multiformats@3.0.3</code></pre><h3 id="setup-did-and-3id-connect">Setup DID and 3ID Connect</h3><p>In the example setup below we use an injected Ethereum provider (such as MetaMask) to create a 3ID Connect and DID instance.</p><pre><code>import { DID } from 'dids'
import { ThreeIdConnect, EthereumAuthProvider } from '3id-connect'

// create 3id connect instance
const addresses = await window.ethereum.enable()
const authProvider = new EthereumAuthProvider(window.ethereum, addresses[0])
await threeIdConnect.connect(authProvider)

// create did instance
const didProvider = await threeIdConnect.getDidProvider()
const did = new DID({ provider: didProvider })
await did.authenticate()
window.did = did
console.log('Connected with DID:', did.id)</code></pre><h2 id="create-a-signed-data-structure">Create a signed data structure</h2><p>We can now start signing and adding data to IPFS! First lets create a simple function that takes a payload, signs it using the <code>did.createDagJWS</code> method, and adds the resulting data to IPFS. As we can see in the code below we get two objects back from this method: <code>jws</code> which is the DagJWS itself and <code>linkedBlock</code> which is the raw bytes of the encoded payload. What happens in the background is that the payload gets encoded using <strong>dag-cbor</strong>, after this the CID of the encoded payload is used as the payload of the created <code>jws</code>. We can access this payload CID on the DagJWS instance as <code>jws.link</code>.</p><pre><code>async function addSignedObject(payload) {
  // sign the payload as dag-jose
  const { jws, linkedBlock } = await did.createDagJWS(payload)
  // put the JWS into the ipfs dag
  const jwsCid = await ipfs.dag.put(jws, { format: 'dag-jose', hashAlg: 'sha2-256' })
  // put the payload into the ipfs dag
  await ipfs.block.put(linkedBlock, { cid: jws.link })
  return jwsCid
}</code></pre><p>Using this function, let's create our first signed data objects:</p><pre><code>// Create our first signed object
const cid1 = await addSignedObject({ hello: 'world' })

// Log the DagJWS:
console.log((await ipfs.dag.get(cid1)).value)
// &gt; {
// &gt;   payload: "AXESIHhRlyKdyLsRUpRdpY4jSPfiee7e0GzCynNtDoeYWLUB",
// &gt;   signatures: [{
// &gt;     signature: "h7bHmTaBGza_QlFRI9LBfgB3Nw0m7hLzwMm4nLvcR3n9sHKRoCrY0soWnDbmuG7jfVgx4rYkjJohDuMNgbTpEQ",
// &gt;     protected: "eyJraWQiOiJkaWQ6MzpiYWdjcWNlcmFza3hxeng0N2l2b2tqcW9md295dXliMjN0aWFlcGRyYXpxNXJsem4yaHg3a215YWN6d29hP3ZlcnNpb24taWQ9MCNrV01YTU1xazVXc290UW0iLCJhbGciOiJFUzI1NksifQ"
// &gt;   }],
// &gt;   link: CID(bafyreidykglsfhoixmivffc5uwhcgshx4j465xwqntbmu43nb2dzqwfvae)
// &gt; }

// Log the payload:
ipfs.dag.get(cid1, { path: '/link' }).then(b =&gt; console.log(b.value))
// &gt; { hello: 'world' }

// Create another signed object that links to the previous one
const cid2 = addSignedObject({ hello: 'getting the hang of this', prev: cid1 })

// Log the new payload:
ipfs.dag.get(cid2, { path: '/link' }).then(b =&gt; console.log(b.value))
// &gt; {
// &gt;   hello: 'getting the hang of this'
// &gt;   prev: CID(bagcqcerappi42sb4uyrjkhhakqvkiaibkl4pfnwpyt53xkmsbkns4y33ljzq)
// &gt; }

// Log the old payload:
ipfs.dag.get(cid2, { path: '/link/prev/link' }).then(b =&gt; console.log(b.value))
// &gt; { hello: 'world' }
</code></pre><p>Note that the values of the CIDs and JWS will be different for you since the payload will be signed by your DID.</p><h2 id="verify-a-signed-data-structure">Verify a signed data structure</h2><p>Verifying a JWS is very straight forward. Simply retrieve the JWS object and pass it to the <code>verifyJWS</code> method. If the signature is invalid, this function will throw an error. If the signature is valid, it will will return the DID (with key fragment) that was used to sign the JWS.</p><pre><code>const jws1 = await ipfs.dag.get(cid1)
const jws2 = await ipfs.dag.get(cid2)

const signingDID1 = await did.verifyJWS(jws1)
await did.verifyJWS(jws2)
</code></pre><h2 id="encrypted-data-in-ipfs">Encrypted data in IPFS</h2><p>Signed data in IPFS is one piece of the puzzle, but perhaps more interesting is encrypted data. With the use of <em>dag-jose</em> and <em>EIP-2844</em> we can encrypt data to one or multiple DIDs and store it directly in IPFS. Below we demonstrate how to use the convenient tools provided by the <em>js-did</em> library to do this.</p><h2 id="encrypt-ipld-data">Encrypt IPLD data</h2><p>There is a simple method to create a DagJWE object which is encrypted to one or multiple DIDs, <code>createDagJWE</code>. This method accepts an IPLD object (a JSON object that may also include CID links) and an array of DIDs. It will resolve the DIDs to retrieve the public encryption keys found in their DID document and create a JWE that is encrypted to these keys. To get going, let's create a helper function that creates a JWE and puts it into IPFS.</p><pre><code>async function addEncryptedObject(cleartext, dids) {
    const jwe = await did.createDagJWE(cleartext, dids)
    return ipfs.dag.put(jwe, { format: 'dag-jose', hashAlg: 'sha2-256' })
}
</code></pre><p>Once we have this function we can create a few encrypted objects. In the example below we first create a simple encrypted object, then we create an additional encrypted object that links to the previous one.</p><pre><code>const cid3 = await addEncryptedObject({ hello: 'secret' }, [did.id])

const cid4 = await addEncryptedObject({ hello: 'cool!', prev: cid3 }, [did.id])</code></pre><p>Note that in the example above we use <code>[did.id](&lt;http://did.id&gt;)</code> to encrypt the data to the currently authenticated DID. We can of course also encrypt the data to the DID of a user that is not locally authenticated, such as another user!</p><h2 id="decrypt-ipld-data">Decrypt IPLD data</h2><p>When the data is retrieved from IPFS we will just get the encrypted JWE. This means that we need to decrypt the data after we fetch it. Since we have created objects that link to each other, lets create a function that retrieves these objects and decrypts them recursively.</p><pre><code>async function followSecretPath(cid) {
    const jwe = (await ipfs.dag.get(cid)).value</code></pre></div></section></div>

<p>Whenever I need to quickly look something up (or use a calculator), I open a
new terminal (using a keyboard shortcut) and start typing into it. Slow bash
startup disrupts this workflow as I would often type before the shell prompt:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine">hyperfine</a> is a brilliant command-line tool for benchmarking commands that
I discovered recently (thanks to Daniel!), so let’s see where we are now:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[tomi@notes ~]$ hyperfine 'bash -i'
Benchmark #1: bash -i
  Time (mean ± σ):     165.8 ms ±   0.7 ms    [User: 156.3 ms, System: 12.8 ms]
  Range (min … max):   164.9 ms … 167.1 ms    17 runs
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we need to find out what’s taking so long. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5014823/how-to-profile-a-bash-shell-script-slow-startup/20855353">How to profile a bash shell
script slow startup?</a> Most Stack Overflow answers suggest some
variant of <code>set -x</code>, which will help us find any single command that takes
unusually long.</p>

<h4 id="man">man</h4>

<p>In my case, that command was <code>man -w</code>, specifically <a href="https://github.com/liskin/dotfiles/blob/7d14190467fe22bf5d4f85a7b202118d2341e3ed/.bashrc.d/10_env.sh#L8-L10">this piece of my
<code>.bashrc.d/​10_env.sh</code></a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>export </span><span>MANPATH</span><span>=</span><span>$HOME</span>/.local/share/man:
<span># FIXME: workaround for /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/man</span>
<span>MANPATH</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>man <span>-w</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Turns out none of this is needed any more, <code>man</code> and <code>manpath</code> now add
<code>~/.local/​share/​man</code> automatically so I can just drop it and save more than
100&nbsp;ms<sup id="fnref:man-seccomp" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:man-seccomp">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h4 id="death-by-a-thousand-cuts">death by a thousand cuts</h4>

<p>But that’s it. No other single command stands out, it’s just a lot of small
things that add up. Daniel says “it has to take <em>some</em> time,” and he’s mostly
right, but I still have one trick up my sleeve.</p>

<p>My <code>.bashrc</code> is split into several smaller parts in <code>~/.bashrc.d</code>, so I can
profile these and see if anything stands out. My
<a href="https://github.com/liskin/dotfiles/blob/68964611b4b578b646cf5f13a47a4ee77e93e740/.bashrc"><code>.bashrc</code></a>
thus becomes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>for </span>i <span>in</span> ~/.bashrc.d/<span>*</span>.sh<span>;</span> <span>do
	if</span> <span>[[</span> <span>$__bashrc_bench</span> <span>]]</span><span>;</span> <span>then
		</span><span>TIMEFORMAT</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$i</span><span>: %R"</span>
		<span>time</span> <span>.</span> <span>"</span><span>$i</span><span>"</span>
		<span>unset </span>TIMEFORMAT
	<span>else</span>
		<span>.</span> <span>"</span><span>$i</span><span>"</span>
	<span>fi
done</span><span>;</span> <span>unset </span>i
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s see what happens…</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[tomi@notes ~]$ __bashrc_bench=1 bash -i
/home/tomi/.bashrc.d/10_env.sh: 0,118
/home/tomi/.bashrc.d/20_history.sh: 0,000

/home/tomi/.bashrc.d/90_fzf.sh: 0,011
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>118&nbsp;ms in <code>10_env.sh</code> was caused by <code>man -w</code> and we know what to do with that.</p>

<h4 id="completions">completions</h4>

<p>11&nbsp;ms in <code>31_​completion.sh</code> which loads <a href="https://github.com/scop/bash-completion">bash-completion</a>. That’s
certainly better than Daniel’s 235&nbsp;ms, probably because up-to-date
bash-completion only loads a few necessary completions and defers everything
else to being loaded on demand. I couldn’t live without the completions, so
11&nbsp;ms is a fair price.</p>

<p>8&nbsp;ms for <code>50_​git_​dotfiles.sh</code>, which defines a few aliases and
sets up git completions for my <code>git-dotfiles</code> alias, seems too much, though.
Good news is that we don’t need to drop this. We can use bash-completion’s
on-demand loading. Whenever completions for command <code>cmd</code> are needed for the
first time, bash-completion looks for
<code>~/.local/​share/​bash-completion/​completions/​cmd</code> or
<code>/usr/​share/​bash-completion/​completions/​cmd</code>.</p>

<p>Therefore,
<a href="https://github.com/liskin/dotfiles/blob/68964611b4b578b646cf5f13a47a4ee77e93e740/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/git-dotfiles"><code>~/.local/​share/​bash-completion/​completions/​git-dotfiles</code></a>
becomes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>. /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/git
complete -F _git git-dotfiles
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="fzf">fzf</h4>

<p><code>90_fzf.sh</code> loads key bindings and completions code so that <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a> is used
when searching through history, completing <code>**</code> in filenames, etc. Well worth
the 11&nbsp;ms it needs to load<sup id="fnref:fzf" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fzf">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h4 id="are-we-done-yet">are we done yet?</h4>

<p>After these changes, I got:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[tomi@notes ~]$ __bashrc_bench=1 bash -i
/home/tomi/.bashrc.d/10_env.sh: 0,001
/home/tomi/.bashrc.d/20_history.sh: 0,000

/home/tomi/.bashrc.d/50_mc.sh: 0,000
/home/tomi/.bashrc.d/90_fzf.sh: 0,011
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s 29&nbsp;ms, brilliant! Or… is it? <emoji>🤔</emoji></p>

<div><div><pre><code>[tomi@notes ~]$ hyperfine 'bash -i'
Benchmark #1: bash -i
  Time (mean ± σ):      55.7 ms ±   1.0 ms    [User: 47.6 ms, System: 11.1 ms]
  Range (min … max):    54.8 ms …  58.9 ms    53 runs
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="history">history</h4>

<p>Some of those additional 26&nbsp;ms are spent reading my huge
(<code>HISTSIZE=​50000</code>) <code>.bash_​history</code> file. I will skip the details
about how I investigated this, because I didn’t: I stumbled upon this by
chance while testing something else.</p>

<p>We can see that using an empty history file brings us down to a little under
40&nbsp;ms:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[tomi@notes ~]$ HISTFILE=/tmp/.bash_history_tmp hyperfine 'bash -i'
Benchmark #1: bash -i
  Time (mean ± σ):      38.6 ms ±   0.7 ms    [User: 34.0 ms, System: 7.8 ms]
  Range (min … max):    37.8 ms …  42.3 ms    75 runs
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, cutting 17&nbsp;ms by sacrificing the shell history is probably not a good
deal for most people. I settled for setting up a systemd
<a href="https://github.com/liskin/dotfiles/blob/f978be7424946afebe56dbe5ecc85c9f36d1e057/.config/systemd/user/liskin-backup-bash-history.timer">timer</a>
to <a href="https://github.com/liskin/dotfiles/blob/f978be7424946afebe56dbe5ecc85c9f36d1e057/bin/liskin-backup-bash-history">back up
<code>.bash_​history</code></a>
to git once a day and lowered <code>HISTSIZE</code> to 5000<sup id="fnref:history" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:history">3</a></sup>. This still keeps
my bash startup below 40&nbsp;ms:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[tomi@notes ~]$ hyperfine 'bash -i'
Benchmark #1: bash -i
  Time (mean ± σ):      39.9 ms ±   0.5 ms    [User: 36.1 ms, System: 6.8 ms]
  Range (min … max):    39.1 ms …  42.1 ms    73 runs
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>By dropping unnecessary invocation of <code>man -w</code>, deferring loading of git
completions to when they’re needed, and shortening my shell history file, I
managed to speed up bash startup from 165 ms to 40 ms.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Benchmark #1: bash -i
  Time (mean ± σ):     165.8 ms ±   0.7 ms    [User: 156.3 ms, System: 12.8 ms]
  Range (min … max):   164.9 ms … 167.1 ms    17 runs
</code></pre></div></div>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>More importantly, I no longer type before the prompt, even if I try!</p>

<p><img src="https://work.lisk.in/img/even-faster-bash-startup/corrtype.png" alt="not messed up prompt"></p>

<p>And at this point I can finally agree with Daniel that further tweaking will
only have diminishing returns<sup id="fnref:latency" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:latency">4</a></sup>. <emoji>😊</emoji></p>

<p>Redditor <em>buttellmewhynot</em> (pun intended)
<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/jxfm2y/even_faster_bash_startup_165_ms_40_ms/gcxiigg/">comments</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I feel like it shouldn’t matter that the shell starts with a delay. If you
start a shell, the computer should assume that you want further input
directed there and queue somewhere to send it to the shell when it’s up.</p>

  <p>I understand that there’s probably a lot of weird quirks about how terminals
and shells work and how processes get created but surely there’s a way to do
this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They’re right on both points. The input is queued somewhere, and there is a
way to fix the messed up prompt. As some might suspect, <a href="https://www.zsh.org/">zsh</a> handles it
fine: try running <code>sleep 5</code> and type some input in the meantime:</p>

<figure>
  <table>
<thead><tr><th>zsh</th><th>bash</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><img src="https://work.lisk.in/img/even-faster-bash-startup/zsh-nolf.png" alt="zsh no lf"></td>

</tr>
</tbody></table>
  <figcaption>pending input handling without custom prompt</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We can see that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in all cases, the input appears twice (bit annoying, but tolerable)</li>
  <li>zsh prompt is never messed up</li>
  <li>bash prompt is messed up if there’s no newline after the input<sup id="fnref:readline-assumes" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:readline-assumes">5</a></sup></li>
  <li>no input is discarded, in contrast to the first image of this post</li>
</ul>

<p>Turns out <a href="https://github.com/liskin/dotfiles/blob/460bdc3c5fa814b874c19d172ce0e3955e278207/.bashrc.d/20_prompt.sh#L13-L27">my PROMPT_COMMAND</a> which was meant to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/19943482/3407728">ensure
the prompt always starts on new line</a> was discarding
the pending input. Zsh uses <a href="https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh/blob/19390a1ba8dc983b0a1379058e90cd51ce156815/Src/utils.c#L1599">a different approach</a>,
printing <code>$COLUMNS</code> spaces and then a carriage return
(<a href="https://serverfault.com/a/97543">explanation</a>), which I don’t like as it messes
up copy/paste. But I <a href="https://github.com/liskin/dotfiles/compare/a5db1831b37f89e00a637bcc20594a4fcf16de1d^...322ad36ec1d3ee5485c7b637e4c41fff7ea6745c">managed to improve my solution</a> to
correctly detect pending input and not discard it.</p>

<!--and [trying to do what zsh does][new-prompt-command] fixes
it:-->

<p><img src="https://work.lisk.in/img/even-faster-bash-startup/earlytype.png" alt="not messed up prompt after early typing"></p>

<p>It’s not perfect (so I’ll still try to keep bash startup fast), but it’s
definitely an improvement, and it will be useful whenever I get impatient with
a slow command and start typing the next command before the prompt appears.</p>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/buttellmewhynot"><em>buttellmewhynot</em></a> for
nudging me in the correct direction.</p>

Embree’s research led to the development of a top-secret weapon known as the “heart-attack gun.”</p><p>It involved the freezing of shellfish toxin mixed with water to form a frozen dart which would then be fired from the heart-attack gun. Once inside the body, the poison would then dissolve into the person’s bloodstream and cause a heart attack.</p><p>In 1975 CIA Director William Colby presented the weapon at a Church Committee hearing, chaired by Senator Frank Church. The heart attack gun was a handgun with a sight affixed to the top, had a battery in the handle, and used electricity to fire a dart.</p><p>Colby told the committee that the weapon was capable of firing a dart which could enter the body “without perception.” The only way of knowing that the person had been shot by the weapon, was the presence of a tiny red dot at the point of entry. Colby also claimed that the poison would not show up in the autopsy. The official cause of death would, therefore, be deemed a heart attack.

<p>A friend of a relative had brought in their Macbook Air, and kindly asked me to repair it.
This required me to download the latest MacOS for which I didn’t have enough space for.
In a desperate attempt, I decided to clean up my external hard drive, removing files that were taking up too much storage.</p>

<p>This is the exact moment that karma had found its way to my 4 AM adventure to fix this MacBook.</p>

<p>To my surprise I found a folder named “Btc”, where I stored episode of television shows. 
Apparently it has been there since 2015 - this must have been my very first wallet!</p>

<p>Sadly, the wallet wouldn’t open in bitcoin core, it has been corrupted.
The <code>db.log</code> outputs the logs for the BerkeleyDB wallet file, it indicated the following error message:</p>
<pre><code>file wallet.dat has LSN 780/2077553, past end of log at 1/333
Commonly caused by moving a database from one database environment
to another without clearing the database LSNs, or by removing all of
the log files from a database environment
DB_ENV-&gt;log_flush: LSN of 780/2077553 past current end-of-log of 1/333
Database environment corrupt; the wrong log files may have been removed or incompatible database files imported from another environment
</code></pre>

<p>Therefore I was forced to salvage the wallet somehow.
The <code>Bitcoin Core</code> software has an option <code>-salvagewallet</code> which did not appear to help.</p>

<p>A bit of googling around and I found out that uncompressed private keys are prepended with <code>01 01 04 20</code>.
Time to take a quick scroll through the file in <code>HxD</code>, a popular hex editor!</p>

<p><img src="https://kewde.github.io/res/corrupted-bitcoin-wallet/HxD-search.png" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://kewde.github.io/res/corrupted-bitcoin-wallet/HxD-search-2.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I didn’t expect to get 145 hits, but what I certainly didn’t want to do was manually converting all of those hits to private keys and checking the balance.</p>

<p><img src="https://kewde.github.io/res/corrupted-bitcoin-wallet/HxD-search-3.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The private key is 32 bytes long and is just after our prefix.</p>
<pre><code>ffb2b2ed484fa1d5c9b2f4ad8e7ec696
</code></pre>

<p>So I got to work, the result is below.</p>


<pre><code>pip install bit
</code></pre>

<p>Take the code below and put in a file named <code>salvage.py</code>
<strong>Do not forget to uncomment and change the address variable on line 7</strong>.</p>

<p>Finally, run the script!</p>
<pre><code>python salvage.py
</code></pre>

<p>It will output something like this, and if it finds funds, will automatically transfer them over to the address your specified.
PS: do not post this publicly, the first string is the <code>private key</code>, followed by the <code>address</code> and finally the <code>amount of btc</code>.</p>

<p>In retrospect, I could’ve used PyWallet but I decided not to.</p>

<h2 id="stricter-validation">Stricter validation</h2>
<p>The PyWallet implementation does a lot more checks before it decides that a key is “valid”.
It seems to be using a concept of both “prefixes” and “suffixes” for the keys.
Additionally the prefix used in <code>PyWallet</code> is a lot larger, <code>308201130201010420</code> instead of <code>01010420</code>.
If by any chance a single character of the prefix and/or suffix get corrupted, it will not detect it as a key.
My approach is more aggressive in the sense that it will attempt anything that might look like a key.</p>

<h2 id="unencrypted-wallet">Unencrypted wallet</h2>
<p>Additionally, my wallet was not encrypted, therefore it was a bit overkill to use PyWallet.</p>

<h2 id="the-real-reason">The real reason</h2>
<p>I was ony my Windows machine and I didn’t feel like spending an hour to install dependencies like <code>python-twisted</code>, when I could get the job done with less code.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, PyWallet is a great tool and it is worth using for encrypted wallets.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p><em>Part 1: How your user experience changes for the worse as the open web gives way to walled gardens</em></p><p>I hang out in two circles. Open web enthusiasts that are lamenting its demise, and regular users who are happy with their fast snappy apps and couldn't care less. </p><p>These groups have a hard time talking because the "open web" too often comes across as an idealistic abstract notion and most end users just don't tangibly feel the bad consequences. In fact, they're often happier with the snappy, vertically integrated experience of closed app ecosystems. </p><p>My goal here is to make it more palpable how everyday apps, searches and tools get worse when we let big centralized companies take over the web, and explore some paths for reversing it.</p><h2>What is the the open web?</h2><p>Most definitions of the "open web" I've seen are either too technical to be accessible or too abstract to be usable and getting gridlocked in this debate often means watching from the sidelines while actual user welfare slowly diminishes.</p><p>Three characteristics that proponents of the open web will agree to in roughly descending order are:</p><ul><li><strong>Ease of publishing</strong>: anyone can publish to it freely or at least very cheaply, and is on the same footing with a globally accessible URL</li><li><strong>Ease of consuming</strong>: Net neutrality — ISP's dont cut deals with corporations to make some websites load faster or cheaper than others.</li><li><strong>Ease of remixing</strong>. You can see the source code. Content licenses and tools are permissive for derived works.</li></ul><h2>Detour: A framework to break down how people use the web</h2><p>I want to focus on the user experience point of view. To do this, I'm going to introduce a framework that divides up all our internet usage into two categories.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/xscGdbWOOPkGjdER.png" alt="Frame 1.png"></p><h3><strong>Unfamiliar problems</strong></h3><p>You have an unfamiliar problem and to solve it you either need to learn something new, or purchase goods or services to solve it</p><ul><li>e.g. taking out a mortgage, a health problem in the family, where to go to college, what skill to acquire next.</li><li>Unfamiliar problems are solved in large part with acquiring new knowledge, not just products or services.</li><li>These user journeys start with search engines — Google predominantly and **a lot of the time solving them is spent on web pages**.</li><li>When people are looking to solve unfamiliar problems, **revenue is typically higher-margin**, because users can't price the products and services as well.</li><li>These ultimately transition to being familiar problems.</li></ul><h3><strong>Familiar problems</strong></h3><ul><li>e.g. being entertained, keeping the dog food in stock,</li><li>These are best solved with apps like Email, Netflix, Twitter, DTC subscription boxes, etc.</li><li>Solving these needs has a very well defined user interaction journey. You open the app you're familiar with and follow its standard flow.</li><li>Revenue from people solving familiar problems is typically lower-margin and there's more competing products.
</li></ul><h3>How we're spending our time on familiar vs. unfamiliar problems</h3><p>Using time spent in apps vs mobile web on mobile is a way to proxy how we divide up our time.<strong> We spend most of our time on familiar problems but have a constant trickle of unfamiliar problems</strong>.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/cPuXkKFELALeIAkI.png" alt="Untitled (1).png"></p><h2>Unfamiliar problems are better solved with the open web</h2><p>Think about the last time you did some research, e.g. choosing a phone plan. You asked your friends, compared on forums, looked at the official sites, scribbled some notes and made a decision. Even if this journey was quick, you likely traversed a dozen services and products to do this.</p><p>Unfamiliar problems have less constraints, require creativity to solve, and thus are better suited to open solutions. Some other things that work for the open web here</p><ul><li>comparing alternatives is easier.</li><li>changing modalities (e.g. from reading to video) is easier.</li></ul><h2>Familiar problems stand to benefit more from tight vertical integration</h2><p>Take Spotify for example. It solves the very familiar problem of listening to music. Spotify just works better as an app because</p><ul><li>Controlling the user experience end to end makes for smoother flows.</li><li>Having all the user data kept with Spotify allows for better recommendation algorithms.</li><li>Spotify can easily hand off between devices.</li><li>It can run in the background</li></ul><p>Sure, the web can do a bunch of these things, but they're simply not first-class considerations in the open-read-close workflow that the browser was designed for.</p><h2>But the open web can be better for familiar problems too, especially for breaking monopolies</h2><p>Let's look at Amazon. Initially you start buying there because of their "always low prices" and the convenience of 2 day shipping. Over the years you keep shopping there, until you've forgotten that </p><ol><li>free 2 day shipping is now near universal</li><li>amazon isn't often the cheapest place</li></ol><p>On the Amazon app, you see the story around the product that best serves Amazon, not the buyer. Meanwhile, over on Insight you can use the web version and do all these things the app can't.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/ZEblynrLvBsutnlQ.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-11-17 at 5.42.21 PM.png"></p><p>... and not just that

</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/JVZoTRazmYPZXBQQ.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-11-17 at 5.59.22 PM.png"></p><h2><strong>How solving unfamiliar problems gets harder too</strong></h2><p>Unfamiliar problems are solved in large part with acquiring new knowledge, not just products or services. The incentives to freely create knowledge that solves unfamiliar problems is lost as the web closes down.</p><ul><li>Google increasingly takes a larger percent of ad revenue as they <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/less-than-half-of-google-searches-now-result-in-a-click/">start extracting answers from pages and showing them on their search result pages.</a><a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/less-than-half-of-google-searches-now-result-in-a-click/"></a></li><li><a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/less-than-half-of-google-searches-now-result-in-a-click/"></a>Publishers have to either a) paywall their content (e.g. NYTimes) or b) subtly sell products (everyone standing a Wirecutter alternative), or c) ask for donations in order to survive.</li><li>Only a few big name publishers survive. Google and Facebook start sending them more of the traffic that's left, and since domain rank plays a big part in Google's ranking, those that survived assimilate more power and rank better.</li><li>and search engines seem more littered with SEO junk and less actually useful information year over year.</li></ul><h2>In conclusion, and where we fit in.</h2><p>And that's how your user experience slowly degrades, and that's why we stand to suffer as users if we give up the ability to remix software that the web brought us and closed apps are now taking away. </p><p>Our goal with Insight is to give the web (in particular on mobile) a fighting chance by exhibiting how it can be more powerful than a closed ecosystem and give more control to the end-user. We do this by showcasing the web's infinite extensibility and customizability for common use cases like <a href="http://insightbrowser.com/collections/search">search</a>, <a href="https://insightbrowser.com/collections/shopping">shopping</a>, <a href="https://insightbrowser.com/collections/reading">reading</a> and <a href="https://insightbrowser.com/collections/cooking">cooking</a>.</p><p>Insight's advanced features will soon only be available to Pro subscription users but for a limited time we're opening up <strong>lifetime free beta access if you download it via TestFlight below.</strong></p><h3>Coming up in part 2</h3><ul><li>What parts of the open web probably should die off?</li><li>A pragmatic path for what's left of the open web to thrive again.</li></ul><p>We'd love to hear from you, feel free to tweet at or DM us at @<a href="https://twitter.com/insightbrowser">insightbrowser</a> </p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p><img src="https://boonepeter.github.io/imgs/spotify/spotify_track_6vQN2a9QSgWcm74KEZYfDL.jpg" alt="Spotify barcode"></p><p><a href="https://www.spotifycodes.com/">Spotify Codes</a> are QR-like codes that can be generated to easily share Spotify songs, artists, playlists, and users. I set out to figure out how they worked, which lead me on a winding journey through barcode history, patents, packet sniffing, error correction, and Gray tables.</p><h2 id="spotify-uris">Spotify URIs</h2><p>Let’s start with Spotify URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). Different pieces of media (artists, albums, songs, playlists, users) all have a URI.</p><p>The ABBA song “Take a Chance on Me” has this URI:</p><p><code>spotify:track:6vQN2a9QSgWcm74KEZYfDL</code>.</p><p>The ABBA Album “The Album” has the following URI:</p><p><code>spotify:album:5GwbPSgiTECzQiE6u7s0ZN</code></p><p>As you can see, the URIs can be broken up into components:</p><p><code>spotify:&lt;media type&gt;:&lt;22 characters&gt;</code>.</p><p>The 22 characters are the numbers 0-9, characters a-z and A-Z. This means there are <code>10 + 26 + 26 = 62</code> possibilities for each character (almost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">Base64</a>). So the potential number of Spotify URIs is <code>62^22</code> which is equal to <code>2.7e39</code> or</p><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>2</span>,<span>707</span>,<span>803</span>,<span>647</span>,<span>802</span>,<span>660</span>,<span>400</span>,<span>290</span>,<span>261</span>,<span>537</span>,<span>185</span>,<span>326</span>,<span>956</span>,<span>544</span>
</code></pre></div><p>To illustrate that number:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="python">x <span>=</span> <span>62</span> <span>**</span> <span>22</span>

<span># the number of words in the bible (about 1 million)</span>
x <span>//=</span> <span>1000000</span>
</code></pre></div><p>If Spotify printed a whole Bible’s worth of URIs every millisecond they could do this for <code>85,863,890,404,701,306,452,633</code> years. Safe to say Spotify is not going to run out of URIs anytime soon.</p><h2 id="barcode-background">Barcode background</h2><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcode">history of barcodes</a> is quite extensive. Information is encoded into different barcodes in a variety of ways.</p><p>A lot of barcodes encode data in the <strong>widths</strong> of vertical bars. Universal product codes (UPCs) encode 12 digits using combinations of vertical bars of different widths:</p><p><img src="https://boonepeter.github.io/imgs/spotify/upc.png" alt="UPC encodings"></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KarTrak">Another barcode</a> uses colors to encode data:</p><p><img src="https://boonepeter.github.io/imgs/spotify/KarTrak_ACI_codes.svg.png" alt="Kartrack barcode"></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code">QR codes</a> use a 2d matrix of dots to encode data.</p><p><img src="https://boonepeter.github.io/imgs/spotify/qr_code.png" alt="QR code"></p><p>A lot of mail barcodes encode data using the <strong>height</strong> of the bars (like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Mail_barcode">Intelligent Mail barcode</a>).</p><p><img src="https://boonepeter.github.io/imgs/spotify/intelligent_mail_barcode.png" alt="Intelligent mail barcode"></p><h2 id="spotify-codes">Spotify Codes</h2><p>Spotify codes work like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Mail_barcode">Intelligent Mail Barcode</a>.

</code></pre></div><h3 id="forward-error-correction">Forward error correction</h3><p>Next <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code#Forward_error_correction">forward error correction</a> (FEC) is used to add some <strong>redundancy</strong> to the code. This makes the decoding process more reliable. Decoding Spotify codes involves going from analog (bar lengths) to digital (media reference), so it is a good candidate for this error correction.</p><blockquote><p>The fundamental principle of [error correction] is to add redundant bits in order to help the decoder to find out the true message that was encoded by the transmitter.</p></blockquote><p>A simple example of error correction would be to replicate each bit twice. So instead of sending <code>1</code>, you would send <code>111</code>. When that triplet is sent across a “noisy” communication channel, some of the bits could get flipped. But since there are 2 redundant bits, the receiver can guess what the value was meant to be:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Triplet received</th><th>Interpreted as</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>000</td><td>0 (error-free)</td></tr><tr><td>001</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>010</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>111</td><td>1 (error-free)</td></tr><tr><td>110</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>101</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>011</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The patents don’t specify what forward error correction schema Spotify uses, but they do say that they add 15 bits at this step. The code rate of an error correction scheme is the ratio of the information bits to the total encoded bit length. Spotify adds 15 bits to the 45 bit code, so the code rate is <code>45 / 60 = 0.75</code>. This code rate is high (close to 1) meaning it is fairly weak. It facilitates a limited amount of error correction, but that is okay. If you are sending a message to a deep space probe you want a very strong code. A Spotify code is pretty low risk: it’s easy to ping the server a few times if you decode the wrong media reference.</p><p>The total forward error corrected code is 60 bits long, which is the exact amount of information that can be encoded in the 20 octals (bar heights) in the Spotify barcode!</p><p>The patents do mention that Spotify uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_decoder">Viterbi algorithm</a> to decode the media reference from the forward error corrected code. I won’t go into it here, but that algorithm uses the redundant bits from the forward error correction to determine the best guess of the actual media reference.</p><h3 id="gray-code">Gray Code</h3><p>I really like this part of the Spotify codes.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code">Gray code</a> is an alternative way to represent a binary number. If you look closely at the following table, you will see that Gray code works by changing only one bit at a time.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Decimal</th><th>Binary</th><th>Gray</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>000</td><td>000</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>001</td><td>001</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>010</td><td>011</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>011</td><td>010</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>100</td><td>110</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>101</td><td>111</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>110</td><td>101</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>111</td><td>100</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Why does Spotify use Gray code? What is wrong with normal binary representation of the code?</p><p>The difference between 3 and 4 in Gray code is only 1 bit (<code>010 -&gt; 110</code>). In normal binary representation, that difference is 3 bits (<code>100 -&gt; 011</code>). When going from analog (the height of a given bar) to binary, using Gray codes reduces the number of bits that are “wrong” if we calculate the wrong height.</p><p>If the height of a bar is supposed to be 3, but we calculate that it is 3.51 and we round up to 4, the binary representation of that number in Gray code will only be off by one bit. <strong>This makes the forward error …</strong></p></div></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>The OpenAI scholars program requires a final open source project. I've been eagerly working on it and I'm happy to present it now. Along with this blog post, my final presentation, code and an academic paper, I present &nbsp;<strong>Semantic Parsing English-to-GraphQL </strong>(SPEGQL). </p><p>I presented this project in my final project proposal. So in this post, I'll cover some of the highlights. The full details can be found in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EmAFC2LGxu8zG3LI6vMt8SrGpjwYtBpnDqCtj_AnDJQ/edit?usp=sharing">this paper</a>. &nbsp;</p><h3 id="background">Background</h3><p><strong>GraphQL</strong></p><p><a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> is a query language for your api.</p><p>It's become very popular recently because of several reasons. It represents the schema as a graph, nested relations of any depth can be easily queried, it can aggregate data over multiple datasources and responses are predictable among other things.</p><p><strong>Semantic Parsing</strong></p><p>Semantic parsing is the task of converting a natural language utterance to a logical form: a machine-understandable representation of its meaning. In this case I wanted to semantically parse English to GraphQL.<br></p><p>Why this project?</p><p>I had a few reasons to work on this project:</p><ul><li>I wanted to understand the limits of general language models for Semantic Parsing</li><li>This project could potentially ease the learning curve for new developers of GraphQL </li><li>Potential tooling for non technical data users such as managers to gain insights into their data</li></ul><h2 id="objective">Objective</h2><p>Given an English prompt:</p><blockquote><em>“What is the name and date of the song released most recently?”</em></blockquote><p>And some GraphQL Schema</p><pre><code>type song {
 artist: artist
 artist_name: String
 country: String
 f_id: Int
 file: files
 genre: genre
 genre_is: String
 languages: String
 rating: Int
 releasedate: String
 resolution: Int
 song_name: String
}

...
</code></pre>
<p>Find a corresponding GraphQL Query: </p><pre><code>query {
 song(limit: 1, order_by: {releasedate: desc}) {
   song_name
   releasedate
 }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This objective could be tested by passing the prompt and schema though a model to output a query. The process is as follows: </p><figure><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dukk4p2n1/image/fetch/q_auto,f_auto,dpr_auto/https://blog.lambdo.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-02-at-12.13.09-PM.png" loading="lazy"></figure><h2 id="methods">Methods</h2><p>The process required multiple steps</p><ol><li>Create an English to GraphQL dataset</li><li>Run experiments on Encoder-Decoder Transformer models (Bart and T5)</li><li>Collect data and results</li><li>Implement a graphical interface to interact with the model</li></ol><h2 id="results">Results</h2><ul><li>46 - 50% exact set matching accuracy on GraphQL validation dataset</li></ul><p>A couple of example videos will help show results as well </p><figure><iframe width="459" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OG8ZdSkF2BA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>A query is generated for a schema and question.</figcaption></figure><figure><iframe width="459" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HE9Q52THeJY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>The model is able to generalize to new, different schemas it was not trained on.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>That is a short overview of my project. </p><p>Here is the main Repo for creating and validating the Dataset:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/acarrera94/sql-to-graphql">https://github.com/acarrera94/sql-to-graphql</a></p><p>I also created an example notebook for anyone who wants to try out the model.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Welcome to Thursday! </p><p>I’ve been reading some interesting policy reports about everything from <a href="https://t.co/CxLqshzCAg">maternal mortality</a> to <a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/can-we-design-student-loan-forgiveness-target-low-income-families">how to target student loan forgiveness</a> but at the moment there is a lot of demand for me to address the situation at Vox in detail or to assimilate my personal story into a larger narrative about “wokeness” or the culture wars. Personally I’m not a huge fan of navel-gazing. So I’ll just say that my personal interest in reclaiming my status as an independent, blog-like voice transcends any particular issues with any particular publication. I wanted to do <em>this,</em> not go find a different job, and I thank those of you who’ve joined me on this journey.</p><p>But Vox is typical of a few trends that exist broadly in the media industry and that I do think are of interest. </p><ul><li><p>The staff skews very young. </p></li><li><p>The staff is concentrated in big coastal cities, and especially New York.</p></li><li><p>The staff is overwhelmingly composed of graduates of selective colleges (state university flagship campuses and private schools with names you know).</p></li></ul><p>The media industry has long skewed young, educated, and New Yorky. But digital disruption trends have made it more so than ever before. Daily newspapers published in mid-sized cities and small towns are weaker and less significant. A lot of reporters born in the 1960s and 1970s have left the industry as it has shrunk and few of them work at digital native startups. </p><p>Separately from that change, national politics has been polarizing around age, educational attainment and population density in an unprecedented way. A group of young, recent college graduates living in Brooklyn would’ve skewed left in 1990 but this was an era when Al D’Amato could win statewide in New York and Democratic presidential campaigns would win in West Virginia. Today a demographically identical group skews much further left than it used to. None of this is really an outcome that anyone particularly wanted or intended. But it’s put a big thumb on the scales ideologically at the exact same time that economic trends have turned against the startups.</p><p>The result is that I think you should expect the instability we’ve seen this fall to be just the leading edge of the wedge.  </p><h4>Most media isn’t political journalism </h4><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce695ac4-18ca-4c53-a705-9cfd4bf75644_1616x1168.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce695ac4-18ca-4c53-a705-9cfd4bf75644_1616x1168.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ce695ac4-18ca-4c53-a705-9cfd4bf75644_1616x1168.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:1052,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2381922,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a><figcaption>Culture criticism today: Calling out various problematic things</figcaption></figure></div><p>Reeves Wiedeman’s recent <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/11/inside-the-new-york-times-heated-reckoning-with-itself.html">article about internal tensions at The New York Times</a> includes this passage, which gets at a dynamic that I think you see across the media landscape. The vast majority of the people who work at any given publication are not professional political journalists, and generally the further you get from the ~~political journalism~~ section of a media organization the more left-wing things get: </p><blockquote><p>Of all the fronts on which the Times was being pushed to change, the strongest insurrectionary energy was coming from legions of newsroom-adjacent employees in digital jobs that didn’t exist a decade ago. The employees responsible for distributing the Times in the past — typesetters, pressmen, delivery drivers — had never been encouraged to speak up about the ethical questions at the heart of the paper’s journalism. But the app developers and software engineers who deliver the Times’ journalism to the world have held their hands up in just as many Ivy League seminars as their editorial peers. They might be too shy to march over to a masthead editor and complain about a clumsy headline, but #newsroom-feedback had opened a digital door to criticism. Reporters found that suddenly it was the Times’ programmers and developers, rather than their editors, who were critiquing their work. During the town hall about the Cotton op-ed, one data engineer said on Slack, “How many such process failures would be tolerated in tech?”</p><p>Many of the techsurrectionists had come from Facebook or Uber or Amazon to join the Times out of a sense of mission, leaving the ethical quandaries of the tech industry for what they thought were more virtuous pastures. “I joined the company for one reason, and it’s because I feel a responsibility to be a part of a mission that I believe in,” a product manager who previously worked at Apple wrote in #newsroom-feedback after the Cotton op-ed. “This feels like the rug’s been pulled out from under us — not just because it feels like that mission [has] been severely compromised by the decision to publish this piece, but even more so because the products we’re building were used to do it.”</p><p>“It’s like making telephone poles,” one software engineer added, “and finding out they’re being used as battering rams.”</p></blockquote><p>People who cover politics professionally, for better or worse, end up spending a fair amount of time talking to Republicans and trying to understand what conservatives think about public policy issues. If we’re doing our jobs at all correctly we can do stories that bring a mostly-progressive audience a greater understanding of what is happening on the other side. And when a professional political reporter does a bad job it’s often because he or she is taking a dive to maintain relationships with sources on the right, or bending over <em>too far</em> backwards to be fair. </p><p>At the same time, we political journalists have our fair share of totally ignorant hot takes about music or cooking or sports or whatever else that we can fire off. </p><p>The flip side is that our colleagues who cover sports or music or cooking also have hot takes about politics. Hot takes that come from the very narrow demographic and ideological niche that dominates the media and is untempered by the need to actually cover politics.</p><h4>Coverage has gotten really weird </h4><p>Ian Walker <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-5-the-kotaku-review-1845588904">recently ended his PS5 review for Kotaku with this thought</a>: </p><blockquote><p>The world is still reeling under the weight of the covid-19 pandemic. There are more Americans out of work right now than at any point in the country’s history, with no relief in sight. Our health care system is an inherently evil institution that forces people to ration life-saving medications like insulin and choose suicide over suffering with untreated mental illness.</p><p>As I’m writing this, it looks very likely that Joe Biden will be our next president. But it’s clear that the worst people aren’t going away just because a new old white man is sitting behind the Resolute desk—well, at least not&nbsp;<em>this</em>&nbsp;old white man. Our government is fundamentally broken in a way that necessitates radical change rather than incremental electorialism.</p><p>The harsh truth is that, for the reasons listed above and more, a lot of people simply won’t be able to buy a PlayStation 5, regardless of supply. Or if they can, concerns over increasing austerity in the United States and the growing threat of widespread political violence supersede any enthusiasm about the console’s SSD or how ray tracing makes reflections more realistic. That’s not to say you&nbsp;<em>can’t</em>&nbsp;be excited for those things—I certainly am, on some level—but there’s an irrefutable level of privilege attached to the ability to simply tune out the world as it burns around you.</p></blockquote><p>The problem here, to me, is not that Walker ought to “stick to sports.” It’s that the analysis is bad. But because it’s in a video game console review rather than a policy analysis section and conforms to the predominant ideological fads, it just sails through to our screens. </p><p>What actually happened is that starting in March the household savings rate soared (people are taking fewer vacations and eating out less) and while it’s been declining from its peak as of September it was still unusually high.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F885debb5-4601-4e59-9232-382c5c1f8250_1494x718.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F885debb5-4601-4e59-9232-382c5c1f8250_1494x718.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/885debb5-4601-4e59-9232-382c5c1f8250_1494x718.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:700,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:94064,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>One result of this is a lot of people have been able to pay off old debts.

There is economic hardship in America, but the larger trend is that middle class people are seeing their homeowners’ equity rise and their debt payments fall, while cash piles up on their balance sheets, because it’s not safe to throw a big birthday party or take a vacation this weekend.</p><p>Not to just pick on this one article, but it was striking to me because it was both emblematic of the way far-left politics has suffused non-political media and also because the topic had nothing to do with race or gender identity issues.  </p><h4>It’s not really about “wokeness”</h4><p>There’s a lot of talk lately about excessive “wokeness” in the media driving people away from their jobs. But I don’t really think the underlying dynamics are specific to any particular issue area. </p><p>I remember a time in December 2018 when there was a <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/11/26/18112769/amazon-prime-cancel">flurry of articles about an Amazon Prime backlash</a> and I felt inspired to write a corrective noting that <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/12/11/18129809/amazon-polling-popular-confidence">Amazon is actually incredibly popular</a> both as a shopping destination and in polls. In response to a similar barrage of articles about how <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/04/how-should-a-climate-change-reporter-think-about-having-children">maybe you shouldn’t have children because of climate change</a>, I felt inspired to write, at somewhat greater length, my book One Billion Americans. </p><p>The basic dynamic is that if you take a normal distribution (say of political views) and then shift the average a bit to one side, you end up with explosive growth in the number of outliers. In this chart, the average of the red line isn’t so different from the average of the black line.
