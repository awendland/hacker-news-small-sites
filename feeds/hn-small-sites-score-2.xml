          <p>
    Posted on September 16, 2020
    
</p>

<p>If I were to travel back in time 4 years ago, and tell my old self that Haskell was starting to lose its shine, I wouldn’t believe it. I grew up on Haskell, my appetite for category theory was whetted by Haskell, my biggest programming projects have been in Haskell, and my dream job was to work at a company that used Haskell.</p>
<p>But now, I find myself simply not as excited about Haskell as I used to be. What changed?</p>
<p>I think there are a couple things. I think one primary factor is that the kind of programming that Haskell really excells in; i.e.&nbsp;creating abstract, correct interfaces for things, is just not a type of programming that’s interesting to me anymore. When I wanted to work on software as a career, a language that allowed incredible facilities in not repeating yourself was very useful. Types that ensure correctness of data interchange, or lenses that allow access to complicated data structures are all very well for implementing, say, a compiler, or complicated business logic in a web backend. However, my interests in software are now primarily as a scientific/mathematical tool. Numerical algorithms can be done in Haskell, but they don’t really gain much benefit from the type system, and they also don’t have great library support.</p>
<p>No doubt Haskell could be made into the kind of language to use for the problems that I am interested in, but given the choice between working on the problems that interest me, and working on infrastructure for the problems that interest me, I would rather work on the problems that interest me. The general feeling that I have is that Haskell is a great tool for a software engineer, but I don’t want to be a software engineer, I want to be a mathematician that sometimes uses computers.</p>
<p>But there is another reason too. While I think that Haskell is still a great language, it is close to 30 years old at this point. It manages to stay fresh and relevant with an ever-growing list of extensions, and constantly changing best practices and libraries (which is itself a problem…), but it would be very sad if we as a society of programmers had failed to surpass it in any respect with any of the programming languages that have had the advantage of starting from a clean slate. In this post, I want to talk about these successor languages, and what I think about them.</p>
<h2 id="rust">Rust</h2>
<p>Surprisingly, one of Haskell’s great strengths is as a systems language. It manages to be much faster than most dynamic languages, while allowing a much higher-level interface than traditional systems languages like C (obviously). One great example of a “systems” program written in Haskell is git-annex. It is a git addition that adds tracking of large files, and was my primary backup system for a long time (I eventually decided that I didn’t need the additional power from it, and was better served by a more seamless solution).</p>
<p>However, in 2020, the premier system’s language is surely Rust. It would be unfair to compare the performance of Rust and Haskell, because Haskell is optimized for things other than performance. That being said, Rust is <em>faster</em> and <em>lower-latency</em> than Haskell, both of which are important. However, it also has a great type system, unlike C or C++ (we don’t talk about Go…). The type system in Rust is obviously very influenced by the type system of Haskell, but they also implemented “ownership” which allows for the killer feature garbage-collection free automatic memory management.</p>
<p>When I first started using Rust, I really missed monads. But here’s the thing. Having used lots of monads in Haskell, and read lots of blog posts about monads, I’ve learned that in systems contexts, it’s often best to just have a simple monad stack that just consists of Reader + IO (and Maybe’s and Option’s sprinkled about occasionally). Huge monad transformer stacks often raise more problems than they solve. But Reader + IO is <em>essentially</em> the “default monad stack” of Rust.</p>
<p>Rust also has some other killer features, like the ability to compile to webassembly (yes there is ghcjs, but, really, do you want to use ghcjs?) It also from the beginning was targetted towards industry, and consequentially has a much more vibrant ecosystem.</p>
<p>This all being said, I think it is worth looking at the features that are prominent in Haskell that ended up going to Rust</p>
<ul>
<li>Typeclasses (in Rust they are Traits)</li>
<li>Sum types (you may take this for granted, but a lot of languages don’t have them….)</li>
<li>Pervasive pattern matching</li>
<li>Hindley-Mindler type inference (automatic type inference for variables)</li>
<li>Pervasiveness of things being <em>expressions</em> rather than statements</li>
<li>Parametric Polymorphism</li>
<li>The feeling that once your program compiles, it will run</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that we should recognize Rust for what it is, a child of Haskell and the Haskell community, and like all good parents, we should want it to do better than the previous generation. In as much as Haskell is the ideas that form Haskell, the success of Rust is the success of Haskell.</p>
<h2 id="idris">Idris</h2>
<p>OK, mainstream programming languages are great, but sometimes you just want to make the perfect type-based interface to your stuff and show the imperative scrubs what a wiz-kid you are. Or alternatively, sometimes you really care that your software is correct. Or you want to concretize a new category-theory inspired design for a part of a compiler. Nowadays, the language for that is not Haskell, it is Idris.</p>
<p>There are about six different ways to sort of have dependent types in Haskell (types that depend on values, like a length-<span>n</span>) array. I don’t really fully understand any of them, and it is totally unclear to me how they work together. Presumably, there are blogs which outline the One True Way, but… it’s tough. In Idris, it just seems perfectly natural to use dependent types, like, why wouldn’t you able to have a type parameter which was a value? In many ways other than dependent types, Idris is a much cleaner language than Haskell too. And with Idris2, it has support for <em>linear types</em>, which allow mutability in a functional context via guarantees that nobody is going to try and use the old value. If I want to play around with a cool type system in a language that can also actually do things with the real world (i.e., unlike Agda or Coq), I would go to Idris rather than Haskell.</p>
<p>But Idris is undeniably Haskell’s child. The first version was written in Haskell (it is now self-hosting). They are similar in more ways than it is worth counting. Enough said.</p>
<h2 id="julia">Julia</h2>
<p>Unlike the first two, Julia doesn’t really muscle into Haskell’s territory. Scientific computing was never really Haskell’s forte, despite there being some very cool libraries written in it, like <code>ad</code> for autodifferentiation, or various array-handling packages that automatically fused consecutive array operations.</p>
<p>Also, Julia is a dynamically typed language. How could a filthy dynamically typed language ever claim to be Haskell’s child??</p>
<p>Well, for one it steals some of those cool libraries, and makes them much better! Flux is a neural networks library which essentially is just autodifferentiation + some nice utilities, and it is already competitive in my mind with TensorFlow. Julia also has StaticArrays, which integrates the size of the array into the type, and Julia has some neat fusion abilities too for making array operations really fast.</p>
<p>But wait, you ask, how can it do this if it’s not a statically typed language? Well, Julia is not your average dynamically typed language. It actually has a very interesting type system, a full discussion of which is beyond the scope of this post, and the focus on types as the unit of programming is (somewhat?) similar to Haskell (now I’m stretching it a little though).</p>
<p>The real reason I include Julia, however, is because for me personally, it has replaced Haskell as the place to do category theory. This is because of a shift of viewpoint: rather than providing a type system into which category theory can be embedded in to guide typical software engineering tasks, Julia provides a system in which <em>computations</em> in category theory can be carried out in an efficient way. Specifically, I’m talking about <a href="https://github.com/olynch/Catlab.jl">Catlab.jl</a>. A discussion of Catlab.jl is also beyond the scope of this post, but I encourage you to check it out.</p>
<p>Therefore, I count Julia as a child of Haskell (or maybe, I count Catlab.jl as a child of Haskell) because the idea of organizing computation with category theory would not exist in the same way if it weren’t for Haskell.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>If I could talk to the Haskell-obsessed teenager that was me four years ago, I would tell him to keep his mind open. Haskell is still great for a lot of things (compilers come to mind), but if Haskell couldn’t inspire superior successors, there wouldn’t be worthwhile ideas in Haskell. There are those on the internet who are talking about how Haskell is dying, and they may or may not be wrong. Stephen Diehl, one of my main Haskell idols, is distancing himself from the Haskell community because of Haskell’s use as intellectual eye-candy on scam cryptocurrencies, and I think that there may be a tipping point where Haskell loses the zeitgeist of being exciting, and because it never had much of a foothold to begin with in industry, slips into irrelevance. But Haskell will always live on; it had a huge impact on many programmers and many languages disproportionate to its actual use, and it will always have a special place in my heart.</p>

<p>BREAKING: The President has issued a full Executive Order abolishing critical race theory from the federal government, the military, and all federal contractors. </p>



<p>The president has effectively declared war on critical race theory—and extended the battlefield to all of our major institutions.    </p>



<p>To begin, the president explains that our nation was founded on the ideal that “all men are created equal” and denounces critical race theory’s “pernicious and false belief that America is an irredeemably racist and sexist country.”   </p>



<p>The President writes that the “malign ideology” of critical race theory “is now migrating from the fringes of American society and threatens to infect core institutions of country.” He cites my original reporting on the Treasury Department, Argonne National Labs, and Sandia Labs. </p>



<p>The point on federal contractors is a major escalation: if a private company wants to work with the US government, they can no longer teach critical race theory anywhere in their offices. This could potentially disrupt CRT programs in half of the Fortune 500.   </p>



<p>The executive order will also disrupt the flow of money to academia’s critical race theory programs. The order stops all federal grants that support CRT—with the potential to cripple hundreds of academic projects moving forward. </p>



<p>Finally, the executive order has a strong enforcement component: all federal diversity programs must be approved directly by OMB and OPM, and agencies are directed to initiate adverse action proceedings against managers who continue to hold CRT trainings. Furthermore, the President instructs the Attorney General to assess whether critical race theory trainings create a “hostile work environment” and constitute a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.  </p>



<p>The President’s executive order is nothing short of astonishing: he has used all of the mechanisms of power to destroy the anti-American ideology of critical race theory—and immediately takes the fight to the bureaucracy, woke corporations, and universities. He is playing to win.</p>



<p>When I began my reporting, I visualized a single goal: persuading the President of the United States to abolish critical race theory in the federal government. With this executive order, he has gone much further—and taken a dramatic step towards saving the country.&nbsp; </p>

              ScreenPlay is an Open-Source Live Wallpaper and Widgets app for Windows (and soon Linux &amp; MacOSX) written in modern C++/Qt/QML and is in active development since early 2017 on <a href="https://gitlab.com/kelteseth/ScreenPlay">Gitlab</a>.

            <h3 id="1-code-sharing-with-qmake-is-a-mess">1. Code sharing with qmake is a mess</h3>
<p>When developing apps that are a bit more complex, the best solution is often try to split them into little more managable pieces. For example if you want to test your app as a separate executable, a subdirs project (a tree of projects) is the only choice here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <a href="https://wiki.qt.io/SUBDIRS_-_handling_dependencies">subdirs projects</a> is just a simple MyApp.pro that only contains a template and subdirs:</p>

<p>We now have multiple subprojects needing to share code between each other. To tell the compiler where to find the header and source files from the other project, we need to tell the linker what library to link and where to find the compiled files. The way to go in qmake is to make giant .pri files that is solely used for including  files. This is similar to regular #include &lt;xyz.h&gt; in c++. These MyProjectName.pri are now included in other MyProjectName.pro. To fix the relative path problem you have to add the current absolute path to <em>every</em> line:</p>
<h4 id="11-external-dependencies">1.1 External dependencies</h4>
<p>Working with external dependencies on multiple operating system mostly consists of copy pasting chunks of plattform specific paths into your .pro file. This is really a tedious work because every OS handles the paths a bit differently. E.g. we do not have a separate subfolder for debug/release on linux.</p>
<h4 id="12-compiling-performance-killer-config--ordered">1.2 Compiling performance killer “CONFIG += ordered”</h4>
<p>Another big problem with qmake is the seemingly random compiler races. When you have many subprojects that are libraries for other subprojects, it would randomly fail because library libA depends on library libB and libC. But libC was not yet build at the time. Most of the time a simple second recompile would fix this. But this clearly shows some serious flaws. This problem never really was fixed with libA.depends = libB. Maybe (pretty sure) I made some mistakes, but  my colleagues and I never solved this issue. The only way to make sure that the build order is fixed, was to set “CONFIG += ordered” which kills all build parallelism.</p>
<h3 id="2-why-qbs-lost-against-cmake">2. Why QBS lost against CMake</h3>
<p>It was a real shocker when the <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/2018/10/29/deprecation-of-qbs#commento">QtCompany announced to no longer activly support QBS</a>. I was even one of the people who pushed to make a second community vote. QBS syntax looks nice and familiar to everyone who ever coded QML. CMake does not. After working with CMake for some months now,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can confidently say it was the right decision to use CMake instead of QBS as the default build system from Qt6 and forward.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CMake (with has mostly syntax flaws) works solid. QBS problems are more political than technical:</p>
<p>This is one of the main no go for many programmers that dislike Qt for its size (both in lines of code and library size). Also, many people hate MOC. This is the pre compiler that compiles your Qt C++ into regular C++. This is for writing nice code like emit mySignal();</p>
<h4 id="22-yet-another-build-system">2.2 Yet another build system</h4>
<p>We already have build2, CMake, meson, scons that have many projects using outside of the Qt eco system.</p>
<h4 id="23-no-support-for-ides">2.3 No support for IDEs</h4>
<p>As far as I know QtCreator is the only IDE that ever supported QBS.</p>
<h4 id="24-vcpkg--cmake--">2.4 vcpkg + CMake = ❤️</h4>
<p>Remember my rant about external dependencies from paragraph 1.1? Well for me vcpkg is the holy grail for every C++ developer. Install dependencies with one command!</p>

<p>CMake is really ugly if you click on the first 10 google results. This is because <em>google shows you old CMake stackoverflow answers from 2008</em> and often redirects you to the old documentation from 2.8. CMake syntax can be quite nice, because most of the time you only these commands:</p>

<h3 id="4-ninja-makes-cmake-fast">4. Ninja makes CMake fast</h3>
<p>CMake only generates instructions for your build system of choice. This can be a big advantage when working with people that prefer VisualStudio over QtCreator. When using CMake one can (should) choose <a href="https://ninja-build.org/">Ninja</a> as the default build system. Compiling projects with CMake+Ninja is fun. Ninja and CMake comes shipped with the Qt Maintenance in the tools category. Iterative changes are incredible fast and clean to look at with the [13/424] progress.</p>

<p>It’s so fast that working with Godots scons makes me activly want to convert Godot to CMake.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="5-vcpkg-is-where-cmake-really-shines">5. vcpkg is where CMake really shines!</h3>
<p>Managing dependencys in C++ is tedious, many projects even ship dlls with their git repository. This is bad because it blows up the git repo size (we ignore git-lfs for now). A drawback is that vcpkg only supports one global version of packages (you manually install different versions of vcpkg, but this is more like a hack and only seldom needed). This is a feature on their <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/vcpkg-2020-04-update-and-product-roadmap/">roadmap</a>.

In ScreenPlay we simply have an <a href="">install_dependencies_windows.bat</a> or <a href="https://gitlab.com/kelteseth/ScreenPlay/-/blob/master/install_dependencies_linux_mac.sh">install_dependencies_linux_mac.sh</a> to clone vcpkg, build it and install all our dependencies.
When working with QtCreator, we must set the CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE to the relative path of vcpkg. Also we must tell vcpkg on what OS and arch we use.</p>

<p>Going with the flow has its advantages but comes at a cost. Build systems, like qbs, with a big potential get thrown under the bus. What to use is up to the developer and thats why my projects will use CMake from now on.</p>
<p>The next blog post will be about how to set-up Qt projects beyond “Hello World”. Stay tuned!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently came across the new rising star when I watched the <a href="https://2019.stateofjs.com/awards/"><strong>stateofjs 2019</strong></a>. They received the “Prediction Award,” which means they are “awarded to an up-and-coming technology that might take over… or not?”.</p><p>I read about Svelte last year, but nothing caught me, so that I forgot about it. But stateofjs 2019 made me curious, so I visited the <a href="https://svelte.dev/"><strong>website</strong></a>.</p><p>My first impression was okay.<br>It is:x</p><blockquote><p>a radical new approach to building user interfaces…</p></blockquote><p>and Svelte</p><blockquote><p>writes code that surgically updates the DOM when the state of your app changes.</p></blockquote><p>Okay, nice…yeah, that sounds nice! I didn’t know at this moment that I will recommend the framework for your next app, but it got my attention. I am into ReactJs and Angular for years, and I thought that these are enough frontend frameworks. I took a look at VueJs, and I liked it as well, but I never used it in a project.</p><p>Back to the topic! They encourage you to read their <a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-3-rethinking-reactivity"><strong>"introductory blog post"</strong></a>, so I continued. And here it started. You all should watch the video from Rich Harris about <strong>“Rethinking Reactivity”</strong> from <a href="https://www.israel.yglfconf.com/"><strong>You Gotta Love Frontend Code Camp</strong></a>. Even if you are not interested in learning Svelte, if you only like ReactJs, Vue, or any other reason. The talk is very entertaining.</p><h2>Tl;dr</h2><p>Check out what you need to know for your first component in Svelte and learn the main advantages of version 3 from the compiler framework. This post tries to outline the key facts of Svelte and is not a comparison like angular vs. svelte.</p><hr><p>If you like this article, please share it, follow me, <a href="https://marcradziwill.com/blog/rss.xml">check out my RSS feed</a>, and <a href="https://marcradziwill.com/newsletter/">subscribe to my newsletter</a>.</p><hr><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ol><li><a href="#whyuse">What is Svelte?</a></li><li><a href="#whytry">Why you should try Svelte?</a></li><li><a href="#where">Where can you try it?</a></li><li><a href="#firstcomponent">How to start with your first component?</a><ul><li><a href="#parts">Component parts</a><ol><li><a href="#makup">Markup</a></li><li><a href="#styles">Styles</a></li><li><a href="#javscript">JavaScript</a></li></ol></li></ul></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#warnings">Svelte warnings</a></li><li><a href="#rendering">Component logic and conditional rendering</a><ol><li><a href="#ifelse">If/else statements</a></li><li><a href="#loops">Loops in Svelte</a></li><li><a href="#waiting">Waiting for data</a></li></ol></li></ul><ol start="5"><li><a href="#next">What’s next?</a></li></ol><hr><h2>1. What is Svelte?</h2><p>So what is it? It is a component framework. You define components and reuse them all over your web app, website, or whatever you are implementing. Just like in ReactJs VueJs, or any other framework. But what is the difference? One of the main differences is that <strong>runs at build time</strong>.</p><p>But what does that mean, it runs at build time? This means Svelte is more a compiler instead of a runtime component framework. It does not need any abstraction layer in the browser to run your code. It compiles the components you implement into plain JavaScript code.</p><p>Additionally, it comes with its build-in reactivity mechanism. Therefore you don’t need any state management or external data binding library to sync your dynamic div class attribute.</p><h2>2. Why you should try Svelte</h2><blockquote><p>…Frameworks are primarily a tool for structuring your thoughts, not your code. (<a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/frameworks-without-the-framework">Rich Harris</a>)</p></blockquote><p>Svelte is a framework. React and Angular are frameworks as well, and we could also consider using VueJs. What are the main arguments for using Svelte?</p><ol><li><p>At deployment, you get less JavaScript, that running in your browser.</p></li><li><p>Apps developed are highly compatible. For example, if you develop a timer in Svelte, you can use the compiled version of your widget in any other framework. The component exports an autonomous class that you can use for your own app and mount to your DOM nodes. (n<em>ote: There is a smililar method for React</em>)</p></li><li><p>Without the abstraction layer of a runtime framework, you serve less code to the browser. Code splitting can be much more valuable. You serve your code without the framework code.</p></li><li><p>The maintainers are free in choosing the features they want to include in the framework. As Svelte itself is not in the compiled JavaScript output, they can add features without worrying about performance issues for runtime users. They can add many features, and none of us developers has any disadvantages because of the bundle size.</p></li><li><p>It is always good to keep an eye on such great approaches. And in terms of performance and user experience, I think JAMStack applications like GatsbyJs are indispensable.</p></li></ol><blockquote><p>SPOILER: The team behind also develops <a href="https://sapper.svelte.dev/">Sapper - The next small thing in web development</a></p></blockquote><h2>3. Where can you try it?</h2><p>The easiest way is to use their <a href="https://svelte.dev/repl/">REPL</a>. REPL is an online editor where you can check out the framework features in your browser. I recommend you to complete the <a href="https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics">svelte blog tutorials</a> as well. They are built on each other very well, but still independent if you want to jump between features.</p><h2>4. How to start with your first component?</h2><p>If you want to build the app on your local machine, make sure you <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">install NodeJs</a>. Otherwise, you can use the REPL.</p><p>In this case, we use Node to install and the <code>npx</code> command to install the development environment on our local machine.</p><p><code>npx degit sveltejs/template svelte-tutorial</code></p><p><code>cd svelte-tutorial</code></p><p>These commands download all necessary files for us, and we need to finish that setup with <code>npm install</code> to install all dependencies listed in our <code>package.json</code>.</p><p>Run <code>npm run dev</code> to start and visit localhost on port 5000 in your browser.</p><p>Now we are ready to implement our first component.</p><div><picture>

      </picture></div><p>Before we start coding let’s have a quick look on the component basics:</p><h3>Component parts</h3><p>A component is declared in a <code>.svelte</code> file and contains three main parts.</p><ol><li><strong>Markup</strong></li></ol><p>You code your Html in every component file. For example, a specific Html svelte component without style and JavaScript looks like this.</p><p><code>SimpleHeadline.svelte</code></p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Hello world!<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre><ol start="2"><li><strong>Styles</strong></li></ol><p>Your component styles are wrapped between <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags and contain the Html for your component. We add some styles to our headline above, and I rename the file.</p><p><code>StyledHeadline.svelte</code></p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>style</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><br>  <span>h1</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>font-size</span><span>:</span> 42px<span>;</span><br>  <span>}</span><br></span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>style</span><span>&gt;</span></span><p><span><span><span>&lt;</span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Hello world!<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span></span></p></code></pre><ol start="3"><li><strong>JavaScript</strong></li></ol><p>We add <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags to our file. The script block contains the JavaScript logic. To illustrate that, I create another file called <code>DynamicStyledHeadline.svelte</code>.</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><br>  <span>let</span> name <span>=</span> <span>'Nora'</span><span>;</span><br></span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><p><span><span><span>&lt;</span>style</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><br>  <span>h1</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>font-size</span><span>:</span> 42px<span>;</span><br>  <span>}</span><br></span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>style</span><span>&gt;</span></span></p><p><span><span><span>&lt;</span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Hello {name}!<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span></span></p></code></pre><p>See how I also added the same variable into curly braces in the HTML <code>{VARIABLE}</code>. This is how you make the variable accessible for the template.</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><br>  <span>import</span> SimpleHeadline <span>from</span> <span>'./components/SimpleHeadline.svelte'</span><span>;</span><br>  <span>import</span> StyledHeadline <span>from</span> <span>'./components/StyledHeadline.svelte'</span><span>;</span><br>  <span>import</span> DynamicStyledHeadline <span>from</span> <span>'./components/DynamicStyledHeadline.svelte'</span><span>;</span><br></span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><p><span><span><span>&lt;</span>style</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><br>  <span>main</span> <span>{</span><br>    <br>  <span>}</span><br></span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>style</span><span>&gt;</span></span></p><p><span><span><span>&lt;</span>main</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>SimpleHeadline</span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><br>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>StyledHeadline</span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><br>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>DynamicStyledHeadline</span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><br>  <br><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>main</span><span>&gt;</span></span></p></code></pre><p>If you import the component into your App like above, you can see the <code>DynamicStyledHeadline</code> on your local page.</p><div><picture>

      </picture></div><p><strong><em>⚠️ Markup sanitization ⚠️</em></strong> If you want to insert markup into you variable you can use an annotation like syntax. <code>{@html string}</code> will not sanitize your markup. You should escape it manually.</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><br>  <span>let</span> string <span>=</span> <span>'this string contains some &lt;strong&gt;HTML!!!&lt;/strong&gt;'</span><span>;</span><br></span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>  {@html string}<br><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre><h3>Svelte warnings</h3><p>What I like are the warnings the framework is providing. In the example below you, a warning appears that no alt attribute is found. You can see the notification on your local development environment or in the REPL.</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><br>  <span>let</span> src <span>=</span> <span>'tutorial/image.gif'</span><span>;</span><br></span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><p><span><span><span>&lt;</span>img</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>{src}<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>img</span> <span>{src}</span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><br><br></p></code></pre><h3>Component logic and conditional rendering</h3><h4>If/else statements</h4><p>In most cases of your application, you need to render the markup in your application or component state’s dependency. In Svelte, you implement this with <code>if/else</code> statements. If you used handlebars in any project, they might look familiar to you. Any conditional block starts with an <code>#</code> and ends with a <code>/</code>. If you want an <code>else</code> block, you use the <code>:</code> character like below. An else block can be plain or with another if-statement.</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><br>  <span>let</span> name <span>=</span> <span>'Nora'</span><span>;</span><br></span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><p>{#if name === 'Nora'}<br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span>{name} - What a beautiful name.<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>{/if} {#if name === 'Nora'}<br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span>{name} - What a beautiful name.<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>{:else if name === 'Linda'}<br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span>{name} - I like that name<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>{:else}<br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span>{name} - The name is also beautiful.<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>{/if}</p></code></pre><h4>Loops in Svelte</h4><p>I the real world, we need to loop over data. Like an if-statement, you start the block with <code>#</code> and end with <code>/</code> character. You can loop over any object as long as it has a <code>length</code> property. You can loop over generic iterables with <code>each [...iterable]</code>. In our case, we loop through the <code>names</code> array and access the current name with the <code>as</code> keyword. Additionally, we get the current index as the second parameter.</p><p>You can use the destructuring syntax as well. In this case, you use <code>each names as { name }</code>.</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><br>  <span>let</span> names <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>{</span> name<span>:</span> <span>'Nora'</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> name<span>:</span> <span>'Linda'</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> name<span>:</span> <span>'Helga'</span> <span>}</span><span>]</span><span>;</span><br></span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><p><span><span><span>&lt;</span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Beautiful names<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span></span></p><p><span><span><span>&lt;</span>ul</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>  {#each names as currentName, index}<br>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>li</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>a</span><br>      <span>target</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>_blank<span>"</span></span><br>      <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/{currentName.name}_(name)<span>"</span></span><br>    <span>&gt;</span></span><br>      {currentName.name}<br>    <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>a</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>  <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>li</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>  {/each}<br><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>ul</span><span>&gt;</span></span></p></code></pre><h3>Waiting for data with the await block</h3><p>As we all have to deal with asynchronous web development, we also have to wait for it. The JavaScript language features like the <code>await</code> keyword help us with that. In Svelte, we get a handy syntax to wait for a promise to resolve: <code>#await</code> 🚀.</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><br>  <span>let</span> promise <span>=</span> <span>getRandomNumber</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><p>  <span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>getRandomNumber</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>const</span> res <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>tutorial/random-number</span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>    <span>const</span> text <span>=</span> <span>await</span> res<span>.</span><span>text</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p><p>    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>res<span>.</span>ok<span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>      <span>return</span> text<span>;</span><br>    <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span><br>      <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>Error</span><span>(</span>text<span>)</span><span>;</span><br>    <span>}</span><br>  <span>}</span></p><p>  <span>function</span> <span>handleClick</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>    promise <span>=</span> <span>getRandomNumber</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>  <span>}</span></p></span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><p><span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span><span>on:</span>click</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>{handleClick}<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>  generate random number<br><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span></p><p>{#await promise}<br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span>...waiting<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>{:then number}<br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span>The number is {number}<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>{:catch error}<br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>p</span><span><span> <span>style</span></span><span>="</span><span><span>color</span><span>:</span> red</span><span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>{error.message}<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>{/await}</p></code></pre><h2>5.

September 23, 2020 | https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/frugality-is-non-linear/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/frugality-is-non-linear/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>Most people have a mental model of budgeting which is roughly linear. If you spend half as much money, your money will last twice as long. As you approach zero spending, your runway goes up to infinity.</p>
<p>In this model, the space of options looks like this:</p>
<div>
<p>[I am an interactive graph made of javascript!]</p>
</div>
<p><label for="growth">Return on investment =&nbsp;</label>
  
</p>
<p>This model is wrong.</p>
<p>It's wrong because your savings grow over time. If you change the return rate above to 5%, you can see that someone who has 500k in savings and spends 75k per year has a runway of 7 years. At 50k per year that extends to 13 years. But if they can cut their spending to 25k per year they have a runway of 62 years!</p>
<p>Effectively, including growth in the model moves the asymptote to the right - your runway goes up to infinity as your spending approaches some percentage of your total savings, rather than as it approaches zero.</p>
<p>So halving your expenses can much more than double your runway. Or to put it another way - halving your expenses can much more than halve the number of years of your life you need to spend working.</p>
<hr>
<p>I picked the examples above with a particular motive in mind. According to <a href="https://danluu.com/startup-tradeoffs/">Dan Luu's conservative estimates</a> a fresh grad at a big tech company can safely earn ~$500k post-tax in 5 years. The US median income post-tax is ~$25k, and investing in an index fund has historically earned ~5% average returns in the long run. So as a tech worker, if you can manage to live as 'frugally' as the average American, you can <a href="https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement?income=120000&amp;initialBalance=0&amp;expenses=25000&amp;annualPct=5&amp;withdrawalRate=4">comfortably retire</a> before 30.</p>
<p>In the tech industry we have some very loud voices arguing that if you desire autonomy or leverage, the best path forwards is to start a VC-backed startup. But reducing spending and saving towards early retirement has some compelling advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's much more reliable - most startups fail, but most people who work at a large tech company make sufficient money to be able to retire early.</li>
<li>Financial independence is a huge safety net - reducing stress and lowering the risk of later projects. If you still want to run a startup, doing it from a position of infinite personal runway will be a lot less stressful.</li>
<li>By separating the means of earning money from the freedom you are pursuing, it enables pursuing goals in that under-served intersection of valuable but not profitable. Whether that's supporting free software, producing art or home-schooling your children, trying to fit such activities into a profitable enterprise inevitably produces uncomfortable compromises which can be avoided by removing the need to earn money.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last point is particularly compelling if you have strong ethical/political/economic beliefs that would benefit from the leverage of financial independence.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="faq">FAQ</h3>
<p><strong>What about inflation?</strong> Inflation is essentially negative growth, so you can subtract it from the return rate and then keep the rest of the calculations in today-dollars. 5% seems to be a reasonable estimate of average inflation-adjusted returns on stocks based on recent decades, but see below for better models.</p>
<p><strong>What about volatility?</strong> I used a fixed average return rate above, which doesn't tell you odds of running out of money early due to a string of bad years. <a href="https://retirementplans.vanguard.com/VGApp/pe/pubeducation/calculators/RetirementNestEggCalc.jsf">But simulations based on historical data</a> produce similar results to those above, and <a href="https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Kitces-Report-March-2012-20-Years-Of-Safe-Withdrawal-Rate-Research.pdf">retirement planning literature</a> tends to put the asymptote at around 4-5% which is consistent with the numbers above. You should definitely use a more detailed model than this if you are seriously considering this path, but I think the simple model accurately conveys the underlying intuition - that the returns to reducing spending are non-linear.</p>
<p><strong>What about crashes?</strong> The simulation linked above uses data that covers existing crashes, including the Great Depression. But in the event that they are overly optimistic, I think there is a strong argument that having large savings and cheap habits are as useful for weathering a crash as having a filled-in employment history. Especially if you used the additional free time to build useful non-tech skills or strong communities.</p>
<p><strong>What about other countries?</strong> Dan Luu's article suggests that similar salaries are available in many major hubs. I've built a reasonably detailed model for my own situation in the UK and arrived at similar numbers. (Salaries are lower, unless you can land a remote job, but free healthcare and lower cost of living make up a lot of the difference.) It's worth at least running the numbers for your own country, just so you know what your options are.</p>
<p><strong>Hasn't the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRE_movement">FIRE community</a> already said all of this?</strong> Yes, but I very rarely see it discussed in tech circles, so it seems worth repeating. Also I haven't seen the calculation in terms of runway before, and the graph above improved my intuition on the subject.</p>

            <p>September 2020</p>
            <p id="article-description">Mozilla is in an absolute state: high
            overheads, falling usage of Firefox, questionable sources of revenue and
            now making big cuts to engineering as their income falls.</p>
            <hr>
            <figure>
                <img src="http://calpaterson.com/assets/mozilla-boss-pay.svg" alt="a graph showing that executive pay has grown fast while Firefox's market share has fallen">
                <figcaption>
                    Mozilla's top exec pay has gone up hugely even as usage has
                    crashed.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Mozilla recently announced that they would be dismissing 250 people.
            That's a quarter of their workforce so there are some deep cuts to their
            work too. The victims include: the MDN docs (those are the web standards
            docs everyone likes better than w3schools), the Rust compiler and even some
            cuts to Firefox development. Like most people I want to see Mozilla do well
            but those three projects comprise pretty much what I think of as the whole
            point of Mozilla, so this news is a big let down.</p>
            <p>The stated reason for the cuts is falling income. Mozilla largely relies
            on "royalties" for funding. In return for payment, Mozilla allows big
            technology companies to choose the default search engine in Firefox - the
            technology companies are ultimately paying to increase the number of
            searches Firefox users make with them. Mozilla haven't been particularly
            transparent about why these royalties are being reduced, except to blame
            the coronavirus.</p>
            <p>I'm sure the coronavirus is not a great help but I suspect the bigger
            problem is that Firefox's market share is now a tiny fraction of its
            previous size and so the royalties will be smaller too - fewer users, so
            fewer searches and therefore less money for Mozilla.</p>
            <p>The real problem is not the royalty cuts, though. Mozilla has already
            received more than enough money to set themselves up for financial
            independence. Mozilla received up to half a billion dollars a year (each
            year!) for many years. The <em>real problem</em> is that Mozilla didn't use
            that money to achieve financial independence and instead just spent it each
            year, doing the organisational equivalent of living hand-to-mouth.</p>
            <p>Despite their slightly contrived legal structure as a non-profit that
            owns a for-profit, Mozilla are an NGO just like any other. In this article
            I want to apply the traditional measures that are applied to other NGOs to
            Mozilla in order to show what's wrong.</p>
            <p>These three measures are: overheads, ethics and results.</p>
            <h2>Overheads</h2>
            <p>One of the most popular and most intuitive ways to evaluate an NGO is to
            judge how much of their spending is on their programme of works (or
            "mission") and how much is on other things, like administration and
            fundraising. If you give money to a charity for feeding people in the third
            world you hope that most of the money you give them goes on food - and not,
            for example, on company cars for head office staff.</p>
            <p>Mozilla looks bad when considered in this light. Fully 30% of all
            expenditure goes on administration. Charity Navigator, an organisation that
            measures NGO effectiveness, would give them <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&amp;cpid=48#PerformanceMetricTwo">
            zero out of ten</a> on the relevant metric. For context, to achieve 5/10 on
            that measure Mozilla admin would need to be under 25% of spending and, for
            10/10, under 15%.</p>
            <p>Senior executives have also done very well for themselves. Mitchell
            Baker, Mozilla's top executive, was paid $2.4m in 2018, a sum I personally
            think of as instant inter-generational wealth. Payments to Baker have more
            than doubled in the last five years.</p>
            <p>As far as I can find, there is no UK-based NGO whose top executive makes
            more than £1m ($1.3m) a year. The UK certainly has its fair share of big
            international NGOs - many much bigger and more significant than
            Mozilla.</p>
            <p>I'm aware that <a href="https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/relationship-between-overheads-and-effectiveness/">
            some people dislike overheads as a measure</a> and argue that it's possible
            for administration spending to increase effectiveness. I think it's hard to
            argue that Mozilla's overheads are correlated with any improvement in
            effectiveness.</p>
            <h2>Ethics</h2>
            <p>Mozilla now thinks of itself less as a custodian of the old Netscape
            suite and more as a 'privacy NGO'. One slogan inside Mozilla is: "Beyond
            the Browser".</p>
            <p>Regardless of how they view themselves, most of their income comes from
            helping to direct traffic to Google by making that search engine the
            default in Firefox. Google make money off that traffic via a big targeted
            advertising system that tracks people across the web and largely without
            their consent. Indeed, one of the reasons this income is falling is because
            as Firefox's usage falls less traffic is being directed Google's way and so
            Google will pay less.</p>
            <p>There is, as yet, no outbreak of agreement among the moral philosophers
            as to a universal code of ethics. However I think most people would
            recognise hypocrisy in Mozilla's relationship with Google. Beyond the
            ethical problems, the relationship certainly seems to create conflicts of
            interest. Anyone would think that a privacy NGO would build anti-tracking
            countermeasures into their browser right from the start. In fact, this was
            only added relatively recently (<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2019/06/04/firefox-now-available-with-enhanced-tracking-protection-by-default/">in
            2019</a>), after both Apple (<a href="https://webkit.org/blog/7675/intelligent-tracking-prevention/">in
            2017</a>) and Brave (since release) paved the way. It certainly seems like
            Mozilla's status as a Google vassal has played a role in the absence of
            anti-tracking features in Firefox for so long.</p>
            <p>Another ethical issue is Mozilla's big new initiative to <a href="https://vpn.mozilla.org/">move into VPNs</a>. This doesn't make a lot of
            sense from a privacy point of view. Broadly speaking: VPNs are not a useful
            privacy tool for people browsing the web. A VPN lets you access the
            internet through a proxy - so your requests superficially appear to come
            from somewhere other than they really do. This does nothing to address the
            main privacy problem for web users: that they are being passively tracked
            and de-anonymised on a massive scale by the baddies at Google and
            elsewhere. This tracking happens regardless of IP address.</p>
            <p>When I tested Firefox through <a href="https://vpn.mozilla.org/">Mozilla
            VPN</a> (a rebrand of <a href="https://mullvad.net/">Mullvad VPN</a>) I
            found that I could be de-anonymised by browser fingerprinting - already a
            fairly widespread technique by which various elements of your browser are
            examined to create a "fingerprint" which can then be used to re-identify
            you later. Firefox does not include as many countermeasures against this as
            some other browsers (<strong>this is a correction</strong> - I previously
            said Firefox contained none but it's been pointed out to me that <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2020/01/07/firefox-72-fingerprinting/">since
            earlier this year</a> it does block some kinds of fingerprinting).</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="http://calpaterson.com/assets/panopticlick-firefox.png" alt="firefox's results on panopticlick - my browser has a unique fingerprint">
                <figcaption>
                    Even when using Mozilla's "secure and private" VPN, Firefox is
                    trackable by browser fingerprinting, as demonstrated by the
                    <a href="https://panopticlick.eff.org/">EFF's Panopticlick
                    tool</a>. Other browsers use randomised fingerprints as a
                    countermeasure against this tracking.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Another worry is that many of these privacy focused VPN services have a
            nasty habit of turning out to keep copious logs on user behaviour. A few
            months ago several "no log" VPN services inadvertently released terabytes
            of private user data that they had promised not to collect <a href="https://www.vpnmentor.com/blog/report-free-vpns-leak/">in a massive
            breach</a>. VPN services are in a great position to eavesdrop - and even if
            they promise not to, your only option is to take them at their word.</p>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>I've discussed the Mozilla chair's impressive pay: $2.4m/year. Surely
            such impressive pay is justified by the equally impressive results Mozilla
            has achieved? Sadly on almost every measure of results both quantitative
            and qualitative, Mozilla is a dog.</p>
            <p>Firefox is now so niche it is in danger of garnering a cult following:
            it has just 4% market share, down from 30% a decade ago. Mobile browsing
            numbers are bleak: Firefox barely exists on phones, with a market share of
            less than half a percent. This is baffling given that mobile Firefox has a
            rare feature for a mobile browser: it's able to install extensions and so
            can block ads.</p>
            <p>Yet despite the problems within their core business, Mozilla, instead of
            retrenching, has diversified rapidly. In recent years Mozilla has
            created:</p>

                <li>a mobile app for making websites</li>
                <li>a federated identity system</li>
                <li>a large file transfer service</li>
                <li>a password manager</li>
                <li>an internet-of-things framework/standard</li>
                <li>an email relay service</li>

            <p>Many of the above are now abandoned.</p>
            <p>Sadly <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/annualreport/2018/">Mozilla's

In a world governed by a patriarchal system of marriage and inheritance, dependent on female purity to ensure any male offspring were legitimate, the ruined woman was literally damaged goods. Even the slightest whiff of a premarital dalliance could spell her undoing.</p><p>These old school ideas about women's worth have never entirely left us, resurfacing over the years in everything from the work of Andrea Dworkin to the abstinence wars of the late 1990s (when sex ed teachers would memorably compare girls who had sex before marriage to used pieces of Scotch tape). With dowries out of the picture, the idea that sex devalued women attached itself instead to America's sudden obsession with self-esteem. A young woman who had sex, particularly casual sex, clearly didn't respect herself. She was trying to fill an emotional void with cheap physical connection, and—yes—was making herself unmarriageable. <em>He won’t buy the cow,</em> we were told, <em>if he can get the milk for free.</em></p><p>Today, the notion that sexual contact is degrading to women has become wrapped up in the contemporary progressive language of trauma and consent. The damage in question is emotional, not material, but the paternalistic message is the same: innocent women must be protected. </p><p><em>Consent is sexy</em>, we are told, as sex-education pamphlets primly instruct us in the essentials of mid-coital conversation.<em> Do you like it when I touch you there? What do you want me to do to you? </em>Never mind that said literature studiously ignores the fact that for the young, inexperienced people at whom such instructions are directed, dirty talk by administrative mandate just adds a whole new layer of pressure to an already awkward situation: For all its protestations about how <em>hot </em>consent can be, the progressive discourse surrounding sex is markedly unsexy. Amid the obsession with power, oppression and the ever present threat of harm, the notion of desire (or, heaven forbid, <em>fun</em>) all but disappears. Even the most pornographic consent-is-sexy script is about risk mitigation, not titillation, an insurance waiver with a side of heavy breathing. </p><p>This laser-focus on consent effectively recasts sex itself as a dangerous act, to be undertaken with extreme caution and only if absolutely necessary. And if relationships are mainly about power and the threat of abuse, those who pursue them too enthusiastically must be viewed with suspicion. More old-school gender stereotypes crop up here: men are increasingly seen as predators almost by default, while women are cast as helpless, even infantile. (Witness the rise of the word "grooming," previously reserved for sexual predation of children, as something done to women in their twenties.) As a breathtaking range of disappointing male behavior gets swept under the umbrella of MeToo, the line between pursuing a woman and preying on her has become blurred. When it was revealed that comic book writer Warren Ellis <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jul/13/women-speak-out-about-warren-ellis-transmetropolitan">had relationships with multiple women at once</a>, the litany of harms included no sexual misconduct at all; instead, the women were "[shocked] at the sheer magnitude of his pursuits … heartbroken when he stopped talking to them, or angry after discovering he was sending many of them identical messages." </p><p>Shock, heartbreak, anger: these are normal things to feel when a romantic relationship goes sour. But today, they're lumped into the nefarious category of abuse by virtue of the purported power someone like Ellis—older, wealthier, more professionally successful, or otherwise more <em>privileged</em>—holds over his partners. By contrast, the notion that these were known and unavoidable risks of intimacy is dismissed as victim-blaming. As one of Ellis' accusers tweeted, "None of us consented to being manipulated." </p><p>This notion of consent as a safeguard against upsetting emotions is both new and counterintuitive: in most contexts (for instance, medical trials or media interviews), consent is sought precisely because what follows cannot be predicted, and may well be uncomfortable. But in certain progressive spaces, discomfort of any kind is taken to indicate the absence of consent, rendering countless normal human interactions suspicious. Turning someone down isn't comfortable, but neither is asking someone out. Even happy relationships involve moments of discomfort, disappointment, conflict—and even amicable breakups are rarely pain-free. Yet young people are now being taught to expect absolute emotional safety in sex, love and courtship at all times—and that if they feel hurt, disappointed or betrayed, it means they've been violated.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.persuasion.community/p/love-hurts-511?&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a href="https://www.persuasion.community/p/love-hurts-511?&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><p>So how did we get here? Social conservatives say that hookup culture is to blame, and they're not wrong: traditional courtship, monogamy and marriage have their downsides, but they do give relationships a certain amount of structure and security. In the age of Tinder, those safeguards are comparatively hard to come by—and the elaborate (and sometimes ridiculous) bureaucracy of consent regulations may be best understood as a desperate attempt to impose some order on this wild west of sex and intimacy, spearheaded by people who are terrified of being vulnerable or getting hurt. There's a sense that relationships could be made unfailingly safe and comfortable, that disappointment and awkwardness wouldn't exist, if we only had enough <em>rules</em>. </p><p> Relationships have always been risky endeavors, but, ironically, this hypervigilance has made them seem outright terrifying. Every new romance is treated like a scavenger hunt for "red flags" that forewarn abuse, and every breakup is subject to adjudication via the #MeToo framework. Unhappy exes hash out their grievances on social media in a way that used to be reserved for divorced celebrities wrangling for the sympathy of the press. Private affairs are dragged into the spotlight for public reckoning and reparations. Men, already saddled with the pressure of making the first move, have to calculate the additional risk that an awkward overture or misread signal will result not just in rejection, but public humiliation and ruination. For all its valuable contributions to combating sexual harassment in the workplace, #MeToo has also made dating itself at once more fraught and less appealing—for everyone. If every relationship is a power struggle, in which the less privileged party is perpetually at risk of being victimized, why even bother? Who could possibly enjoy this? </p></div><p>This is not to demand a return to the rigid courtship norms of the Regency era—nor to the blinkered sex-positivity of the early aughts. Instead, we need to reintroduce basic notions of female empowerment and individual agency, and push back against the facile understanding of complex interpersonal relationships as power struggles between oppressed and oppressor. We should teach both young men <em>and</em> young women to recognize each other's vulnerability and humanity—even when a partner may hold more power than they do by certain measures—and to engage with their lovers as individuals, rather than as representatives of an identity group. And we should also teach young people to tolerate and work through discomfort, rather than seeing themselves as helplessly in thrall to power dynamics that leave them forever teetering on the precipice of victimhood. </p><p>When I wrote a teen advice column between 2009 and 2019, there was one question I received more often than any other: "How can I fall in love without getting hurt?" My answer was always the same: You can't! Intimacy requires vulnerability; the joy of human connection always comes with the risk of being hurt. But that risk is the same for everyone, no matter how privileged or blessed with institutional clout. Even the wealthiest, whitest, most cisheterosexual dudebro in the world can be absolutely wrecked by heartbreak—and even a person who sits at the intersectional nexus of multiple oppressed identity categories has the power to break someone's heart.</p><p>As much as trauma and abuse have replaced purity and marriageability on the landscape of moral panics, the same old fear is at work: that women's desires, left unchecked, will leave them in ruins. And while the impulse to protect young people from emotional pain may be well intentioned, the results are toxic. The obsessive focus on power as the driving mechanism in all relationships fuels a cycle of catastrophic thinking: women are ever more fearful of being mistreated, ever more convinced of their powerlessness to avoid it, and ever more sure that when it happens, they will be unable to handle it. And all the while, men, dehumanized by a framework that casts their desires as inherently predatory, are being taught to mistrust and infantilize women in the guise of respecting them.</p><p>We need to permanently banish the specter of the ruined woman from our understanding of heterosexual relationships. A healthy, sex-positive society acknowledges that unpredictability is a feature of dating, not a bug, and cannot be consent-scripted out of existence—particularly for inexperienced people, and especially when it comes to casual sex. Young people must be taught to be kind with and conscientious to each other, to respect boundaries, and to err on the side of caution in ambiguous situations—but they should also be taught that love and sex are rife with painful misunderstandings, and that even well-meaning people can hurt each other because they're insecure, confused or genuinely unsure about what they want. Instead of trying to keep them from ever feeling heartbreak, regret or shame, let's teach them that these things are always survivable, and sometimes even useful. Teach them to be gracious about rejection and charitable about missteps, knowing that they'll make mistakes …</p></div></div>

<p><em>Stephen Brennan • 22 September 2020</em></p><p>Not that long ago, I found myself wanting to understand gzip. I didn’t necessarily want to learn to implement the algorithm, but rather I just wanted to understand how it was performing on a particular file. Even more specifically, I wanted to understand which parts of a file compressed well, and which ones did not.</p>

<p>There may be readily available tools for visualizing this, but I didn’t find anything. Since I know gzip is implemented in the Python standard libraries, and I’m familiar with Python plotting libraries, I thought I would try to make my own visualization. This blog post (which is in fact just a Jupyter notebook) is the result.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-measure">What to measure</h2>

<p>Sometimes the hardest part of a data analysis problem is just figuring out what you want to measure. The data is all there, and you have a computer at your disposal, so the possibilities are endless. Knowing <em>what</em> to compute is tricky. In my case, I want to understand which parts of a file compress well. So it makes sense that whatever I visualize should include the position in the file along the X axis, and the compressed size along the Y axis. An uncompressed file would simply be a diagonal line. The better the compression, the more this line would stay <em>under</em> the diagonal line of an uncompressed file.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-measure-it">How to measure it?</h2>

<p>Since Python supports gzip in the standard library, let’s see how we can measure these X and Y coordinates. First, let’s create a file with some compressed data. My favorite to use in this instance is <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11">Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</a>, downloaded from Project Gutenberg. We’ll compress it on the command line for simplicity.</p>

<p>(Note that code prefixed by ‘!’ is executed via bash - everything else is executed in Python).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>!gzip -k alice.txt
!ls -lh alice*
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code>-rw-r--r-- 1 stephen stephen 171K Sep 22 20:25 alice.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 stephen stephen  60K Sep 22 20:25 alice.txt.gz
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>gzip does a pretty decent job at compressing this, far better than I could do myself. Now, let’s use Python to decompress just a little bit of it, and how much of the original file is consumed as we go.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>gzip</span>
<span>compressed</span> <span>=</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>'alice.txt.gz'</span><span>,</span> <span>'rb'</span><span>)</span>
<span>gzip_file</span> <span>=</span> <span>gzip</span><span>.</span><span>GzipFile</span><span>(</span><span>fileobj</span><span>=</span><span>compressed</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the above code, we save the open file object as <code>compressed</code> before giving it over to the <code>GzipFile</code>. That way, as we read the decompressed data out of <code>gzip_file</code>, we’ll be able to use the <code>tell()</code> method to see how far we are through the compressed file.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>first_100_bytes</span> <span>=</span> <span>gzip_file</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>)</span>
<span>first_100_bytes</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code>b'\xef\xbb\xbfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Alice\xe2\x80\x99s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll\r\n\r\nThis eBook'
</code></pre></div></div>





<p>This feels disappointing. We only read 100 bytes and yet it took 8212 bytes of gzip to give us that data? Well, we have to consider that compression algorithms need to store some tables of data which help decompress the rest of the file, so we should cut gzip some slack. Let’s do this a few more times.</p>



<div><div><pre><code>b' is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\r\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may '
</code></pre></div></div>





<p>This feels wrong. After reading 8212 bytes of compressed data for the first 100 bytes, it takes zero bytes to get the next 100?</p>



<div><div><pre><code>b'copy it, give it away or\r\nre-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included\r\nwith '
</code></pre></div></div>





<p>Clearly there is some buffering going on here. 8212 is suspiciously close to 8192 (20 bytes away) which is a power of two, and thus likely to be a common buffer size. Python’s file I/O machinery is responsible for the buffering, but we can actually get rid of it by disabling buffering.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>gzip_file</span><span>.</span><span>close</span><span>()</span>
<span>compressed</span><span>.</span><span>close</span><span>()</span>
<span>compressed</span> <span>=</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>'alice.txt.gz'</span><span>,</span> <span>'rb'</span><span>,</span> <span>buffering</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>
<span>gzip_file</span> <span>=</span> <span>gzip</span><span>.</span><span>GzipFile</span><span>(</span><span>fileobj</span><span>=</span><span>compressed</span><span>)</span>
<span>gzip_file</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>)</span>
<span>compressed</span><span>.</span><span>tell</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>Hm. We made <code>compressed</code> an unbuffered file, but maybe <code>GzipFile</code> has its own internal buffering. To avoid this, let’s do a bad thing. We can actually set the buffer size for all I/O operations by modifying <code>io.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE</code>. If we set it to a small value, then we can reduce the impact of buffering on our measurements. Just for fun, let’s try setting it to 1.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>io</span>
<span>old_buffer_size</span> <span>=</span> <span>io</span><span>.</span><span>DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE</span>
<span>io</span><span>.</span><span>DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
<span>gzip_file</span><span>.</span><span>close</span><span>()</span>
<span>compressed</span><span>.</span><span>close</span><span>()</span>

<span>compressed</span> <span>=</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>'alice.txt.gz'</span><span>,</span> <span>'rb'</span><span>,</span> <span>buffering</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>
<span>gzip_file</span> <span>=</span> <span>gzip</span><span>.</span><span>GzipFile</span><span>(</span><span>fileobj</span><span>=</span><span>compressed</span><span>)</span>
<span>gzip_file</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>)</span>
<span>compressed</span><span>.</span><span>tell</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>This seems <em>much</em> more believable. To read 100 bytes of decompressed data, gzip had to read 205 bytes of compressed data (again, this is probably due to tables and other header information). Let’s continue for a bit:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>bytes_unc</span> <span>=</span> <span>100</span>
<span>for</span> <span>_</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>):</span>
    <span>gzip_file</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>)</span>
    <span>bytes_unc</span> <span>+=</span> <span>100</span>
    <span>bytes_cmp</span> <span>=</span> <span>compressed</span><span>.</span><span>tell</span><span>()</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>'uncompressed: {bytes_unc} / compressed: {bytes_cmp}'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code>uncompressed: 200 / compressed: 279
uncompressed: 300 / compressed: 335
uncompressed: 400 / compressed: 376
uncompressed: 500 / compressed: 449
uncompressed: 600 / compressed: 541
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see that after reading 400 uncompressed bytes, the gzip compression has caught up! 376 compressed bytes needed to be read to give us those 400. The gap continues to widen as we go on.</p>

<p>Now that we’re confident that this approach is giving us interesting data, let’s make some functions to get all of this data for a particular file, so we can visualize it!</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>gzip_file</span><span>.</span><span>close</span><span>()</span>
<span>compressed</span><span>.</span><span>close</span><span>()</span>
<span>io</span><span>.</span><span>DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE</span> <span>=</span> <span>old_buffer_size</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That was just some cleanup. Since modifying the buffer size would likely impact other code we run, it’s best to only modify the buffer size when we need it, and reset it back to its original value when we’re done. This can be done with a context manager.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>contextlib</span>
<span>@contextlib.contextmanager</span>
<span>def</span> <span>buffer_size</span><span>(</span><span>newsize</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>):</span>
    <span>old_buffer_size</span> <span>=</span> <span>io</span><span>.</span><span>DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE</span>
    <span>io</span><span>.</span><span>DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE</span> <span>=</span> <span>newsize</span>
    <span>try</span><span>:</span>
        <span>yield</span>
    <span>finally</span><span>:</span>
        <span>io</span><span>.</span><span>DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE</span> <span>=</span> <span>old_buffer_size</span>
        
        
<span>with</span> <span>buffer_size</span><span>():</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>'size: {io.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE}'</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>'size: {io.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE}'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>Now for a function to retrieve compressed and uncompressed sizes. We can do this with a “chunk size” as a parameter. The larger our chunk size, the fewer data points we will have, but the code will run faster. We used 100 as a chunk size above, which seems good enough, but I do prefer a good <a href="https://xkcd.com/1000/">round number</a>, so I’ll change it to 64.</p>

<p>The above function simply reads the gzipped file in chunks, measuring the distance we’ve gone through the compressed file each time, and adding it to a list of “records”. This list is converted into a Pandas Dataframe, which is commonly used to hold tabular data like this. We set the “uncompressed” column to be the “index”, since that’s what we’d consider the X-axis.</p>

<p>The result looks exciting! We can even go right ahead and plot it from here.</p>

<p>Well, I gotta give it to gzip – it’s pretty consistent. I can’t really see anything interesting in the plot, except that the gzipped data is smaller than the uncompressed version (duh). We can add this in to make it more explicit:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>ccurve</span><span>[</span><span>'uncompressed'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>ccurve</span><span>.</span><span>index</span>
<span>ccurve</span><span>.</span><span>plot</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://brennan.io/images/ccurves/output_30_1.png" alt="Plot 2"></p>

<h2 id="what-to-do-with-this-new-power">What to do with this new power?</h2>

<p>So, the result here seems to be blindingly mundane. gzip compresses reasonably well, it’s obviously better than uncompressed.</p>

<p>Well, let’s try to make things less mundane. First, a peek at the gzip(1) manual page indicates that it has different compression levels 1-9. I’ll let the manual do the explaining:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>   -# --fast --best
          Regulate the speed of compression using the specified digit #, where -1
          or  --fast  indicates the fastest compression method (less compression)
          and -9 or --best indicates the slowest compression  method  (best  com‐
          pression).   The  default  compression level is -6 (that is, biased to‐
          wards high compression at expense of speed).
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What if we used this compression curve plot to compare the gzip compression levels?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>os</span>
<span>files</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
<span>for</span> <span>level</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>):</span>
    <span>os</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>'gzip -k -S .gz.{level} -{level} alice.txt'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>files</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>'alice.txt.gz.{level}'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>'Created {files[-1]}'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code>Created alice.txt.gz.1
Created alice.txt.gz.2
Created alice.txt.gz.3
Created alice.txt.gz.4
Created alice.txt.gz.5
Created alice.txt.gz.6
Created alice.txt.gz.7
Created alice.txt.gz.8
Created alice.txt.gz.9
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Above I went ahead and created all the different compression levels. Now, we can get compression curves for all of them and plot them:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>ccurves</span> <span>=</span> <span>pd</span><span>.</span><span>concat</span><span>([</span>
    <span>create_compression_curve</span><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>fn</span> <span>in</span> <span>files</span>
<span>],</span> <span>axis</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span>ccurves</span><span>.</span><span>plot</span><span>(</span><span>title</span><span>=</span><span>"gzip Compression Level Comparison (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://brennan.io/images/ccurves/output_35_1.png" alt="Plot 3"></p>

<p>That seems slightly more interesting. The default compression level of 6 seems to be chosen well. Beyond level 6, the reduction in file size seems pretty difficult to notice. However, the difference between the compression ratios is rather small compared to the uncompressed line:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>ccurves</span><span>[</span><span>'uncompressed'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>ccurves</span><span>.</span><span>index</span>
<span>ccurves</span><span>.</span><span>plot</span><span>()</span>

        <p itemprop="description">
            Many, many years ago my brother asked me "When are you going to learn programming?". I could barely read and write at the moment, so I had no idea what he meant.
        </p>

         

        <div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p><iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xl0cshUzq34" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2>The beginning</h2>

<p>A few years later, I started to get an interest in web sites and programming. I started learning HTML and CSS. I did this for a few years.</p>

<p>I loved learning, so I wanted more. I started with PHP and thought it was so awesome to be able to store data in a database, creating guestbooks, counters and similar.</p>

<h2>Learning more</h2>

<p>Even thought I at this point could make the web sites I wanted, I still wanted more. I was introduced to a language called Python and a framework called Django. This was like whole new world. There was a lot of new things to learn, but it was so awesome. Building projects with Django is great!</p>

<p>During this time and after, I also learned game development, JavaScript, Vue.js, C# and so many other awesome technologies.</p>

<p>I love learning and I love building things. These two combined is the biggest reason why I got a job without having to get a computer degree.</p>

<h2>Applying for a job</h2>

<p>I found a cool job I wanted to apply for. But before the interview started, I was so nervous and started doubting myself. Why should they hire me? I don't have any experience and my coding skills sucks I thought to myself.</p>

<p>Luckily, I had my girlfriend with me. She pushed me in the right direction and made me believe in myself enough to go in.</p>

<h2>Getting the job</h2>

<p>I went into the interview and after 30 minutes, the boss offered me a position and a salary that was much higher than I had ever hoped for. I was so happy.</p>

<p>I got a brand new Mac and an iPhone. This was so cool, I couldn't believe it.</p>

<h2>Working</h2>

<p>This was around 10 years ago. Since then, I have had 3 jobs and spent around 5 years of them working remotely from Spain.</p>

<p>I love working as a web developer!</p>

<h2>My advice to you</h2>

<p>Keep learning as much as you can, build projects that you love, believe in your self and never give up :-)</p>

<p>Many developers think that having a critical bug in their code is the worst thing that can happen. Well, there is something much worse than that: Having a critical bug in your code and <strong>not knowing about it!</strong></p>
<p>To make sure I get notified about critical bugs as soon as possible, I started looking for ways to find anomalies in my data. I quickly found that information about these subjects tend to get very complicated, and involve a lot of ad-hoc tools and dependencies.</p>
<p>I'm not a statistician and not a data scientist, I'm just a developer. Before I introduce dependencies into my system I make sure I really can't do without them. So, <strong>using some high school level statistics and a fair knowledge of SQL, I implemented a simple anomaly detection system <em>that works</em>.</strong></p>

<h2 id="detecting-anomalies"><a href="#detecting-anomalies">Detecting Anomalies</a></h2>
<p>Anomaly in a data series is a significant deviation from some reasonable value. Looking at this series of numbers for example, which number stands out?</p>
<div><pre><span></span>2, 3, 5, 2, 3, 12, 5, 3, 4
</pre></div>


<p>The number that stands out in this series is 12.</p>
<figure><img alt="Scatter plot" src="https://hakibenita.com/images/00-sql-anomaly-detection-scatter-plot.png"><figcaption>Scatter plot</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is intuitive to a human, but computer programs don't have intuition...</p>
<p>To find the anomaly in the series we first need to define what a reasonable value is, and then define how far away from this value we consider a significant deviation. A good place to start looking for a reasonable value is the mean:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>SELECT</span> <span>avg</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span>
<span>FROM</span> <span>unnest</span><span>(</span><span>array</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>12</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>])</span> <span>AS</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span>

<span>       avg</span>
<span>────────────────────</span>
<span>4.3333333333333333</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The mean is ~4.33.</p>
<p>Next, we need to define the deviation. Let's use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation" rel="noopener">Standard Deviation</a>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>SELECT</span> <span>stddev</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span>
<span>FROM</span> <span>unnest</span><span>(</span><span>array</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>12</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>])</span> <span>AS</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span>

<span>      stddev</span>
<span>────────────────────</span>
<span>3.0822070014844882</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Standard deviation is the square root of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance" rel="noopener">variance</a>, which is the average squared distance from the mean. In this case it's 3.08.</p>
<p>Now that we've defined a "reasonable" value and a deviation, we can define a <em>range</em> of acceptable values:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>SELECT</span>
   <span>avg</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>stddev</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>lower_bound</span><span>,</span>
   <span>avg</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>stddev</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>upper_bound</span>
<span>FROM</span>
   <span>unnest</span><span>(</span><span>array</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>12</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>])</span> <span>AS</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span>

<span>    lower_bound    │     upper_bound</span>
<span>───────────────────┼────────────────────</span>
<span>1.2511263318488451 │ 7.4155403348178215</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The range we defined is one standard deviation from the mean. Any value outside this range is considered an anomaly:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>WITH</span> <span>series</span> <span>AS</span> <span>(</span>
   <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span>

<span>),</span>

   <span>n</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>BETWEEN</span> <span>lower_bound</span> <span>AND</span> <span>upper_bound</span> <span>AS</span> <span>is_anomaly</span>

<p>Using the query we found that the value 12 is outside the range of acceptable values, and identified it as an anomaly.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-z-score"><a href="#understanding-z-score">Understanding Z-Score</a></h3>
<p>Another way to represent a range of acceptable values is using a z-score. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score" rel="noopener">z-score, or Standard Score</a>, is the number of standard deviations from the mean. In the previous section, our acceptable range was one standard deviation from the mean, or in other words, a z-score in the range ±1:</p>

<p>Using z-score, we also identified 12 as an anomaly in this series.</p>
<h3 id="optimizing-z-score"><a href="#optimizing-z-score">Optimizing Z-Score</a></h3>
<p>So far we used one standard deviation from the mean, or a z-score of ±1 to identify anomalies. Changing the z-score threshold can affect our results. For example, let's see what anomalies we identify when the z-score is greater than 0.5 and when it's greater than 3:</p>

<p>Let's see what we got:</p>
<ul>
<li>When we decreased the z-score threshold to 0.5, we identified the value 2 as an anomaly in addition to the value 12.</li>
<li>When we increased the z-score threshold to 3 we did not identify any anomaly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The quality of our results are directly related to the parameters we set for the query. Later we'll see how using backtesting can help us identify ideal values.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="analyzing-a-server-log"><a href="#analyzing-a-server-log">Analyzing a Server Log</a></h2>
<p>Application servers such as nginx, Apache and IIS write a lot of useful information to access logs. The data in these logs can be extremely useful in identifying anomalies.</p>
<p>We are going to analyze logs of a web application, so the data we are most interested in is the timestamp and the status code of every response from the server. To illustrate the type of insight we can draw from just this data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A sudden increase in 500 status code</strong>: You may have a problem in the server. Did you just push a new version? Is there an external service you're using that started failing in unexpected ways?</li>
<li><strong>A sudden increase in 400 status code</strong>: You may have a problem in the client. Did you change some validation logic and forgot to update the client? Did you make a change and forgot to handle backward compatibility?</li>
<li><strong>A sudden increase in 404 status code</strong>: You may have an SEO problem. Did you move some pages and forgot to set up redirects? Is there some script kiddy running a scan on your site?</li>
<li><strong>A sudden increase in 200 status code</strong>: You either have some significant legit traffic coming in, or you are under a DOS attack. Either way, you probably want to check where it's coming from.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="preparing-the-data"><a href="#preparing-the-data">Preparing the Data</a></h3>
<p>Parsing and processing logs is outside the scope of this article, so let's assume we did that and we have a table that looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>server_log_summary</span> <span>AS</span> <span>(</span>
   <span>period</span> <span>timestamptz</span><span>,</span>
   <span>status_code</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span>
   <span>entries</span> <span>int</span>
<span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The table stores the number of entries for each status code at a given period. For example, our table stores how many responses returned each status code every minute:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>server_log_summary</span> <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>period</span> <span>DESC</span> <span>LIMIT</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>

<span>        period         │ status_code │ entries</span>
<span>───────────────────────┼─────────────┼─────────</span>
<span>2020-08-01 18:00:00+00 │         200 │    4084</span>
<span>2020-08-01 18:00:00+00 │         404 │       0</span>
<span>2020-08-01 18:00:00+00 │         400 │      24</span>
<span>2020-08-01 18:00:00+00 │         500 │       0</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:59:00+00 │         400 │      12</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:59:00+00 │         200 │    3927</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:59:00+00 │         500 │       0</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:59:00+00 │         404 │       0</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:58:00+00 │         400 │       2</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:58:00+00 │         200 │    3850</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Note that the table has a row for every minute, even if the status code was never returned in that minute. Given a table of statuses, it's very tempting to do something like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>-- Wrong!</span>
<span>SELECT</span>
   <span>date_trunc</span><span>(</span><span>'minute'</span><span>,</span> <span>timestamp</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>period</span><span>,</span>
   <span>status_code</span><span>,</span>
   <span>count</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>entries</span>
<span>FROM</span>
   <span>server_log</span>
<span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span>
   <span>period</span><span>,</span>
   <span>status_code</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This is a common mistake and it can leave you with gaps in the data. Zero is a value, and it holds a significant meaning. A better approach is to create an "axis", and join to it:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>-- Correct!</span>
<span>WITH</span> <span>axis</span> <span>AS</span> <span>(</span>
   <span>SELECT</span>
       <span>status_code</span><span>,</span>

           <span>interval</span> <span>'1 minute'</span> <span>*</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>We just released a new huge update for <a href="https://signata.net/">Signata</a>, and with it we've done something we somewhat regret needing to do, but it's far better for our longer term product development. We're also calling this our 1.0.0 release, as we've fundamentally changed the service since our earlier Beta releases and we've now settled on a platform that we'll stick to.</p><p>Previously with Signata you could sign up using a multitude of Identity Providers. Now, you can now only use an account created as an email address + password. <strong>We've dropped support for all external identity providers</strong>. Whilst we prefer using external services to handle authentication, this is purely because of technical limitations with the platform that we've built our desktop application on, Electron. And so far we've actually only had a handful of users signing up with 3rd party Identity Providers, so we figured the disruption would be minimal.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.congruentlabs.co/content/images/2020/09/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.congruentlabs.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image.png 600w, https://blog.congruentlabs.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image.png 1000w, https://blog.congruentlabs.co/content/images/2020/09/image.png 1180w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Electron unfortunately runs in a context that doesn't work well with Firebase (our back-end service), as the context is effectively sitting somewhere on the blurry line between Node.js back-end services and the front-end web. This then causes issues with attempting to use IdP credentials gained in the method that we used to use (which, to be honest would be classed as a <em>janky hack</em>), so to improve our release cycle the better approach for us it to remove those options and reintroduce them if Google implement better support for Electron applications that use Firebase.</p><p>Whilst we've taken one feature away, we've added a whole stack of new features, in part because we've now simplified our desktop application <em>significantly.</em> Our code base is effectively the same core design across all of our applications, and we've now been able to bring that design into the Signata Desktop application.</p><p>If you've already registered with an external account like Google, please contact support and we'll help you migrate to using a dedicated account for the service instead.</p><h2 id="faster-and-safer-device-management">Faster and Safer Device Management</h2><p>Our earlier releases relied on a Command Line toolkit we had built for managing YubiKeys. Every action, including detecting their presence, injecting keys, signing and decrypting data, and more was all perfomed by invoking this toolkit from our Electron application.</p><p>I never liked this approach, as I was always concerned secrets could be lifted from the messages being sent between the Signata app and the CLI toolkit. So, we've replaced it entirely with a new gRPC-based device manager utility.</p><p>In a nutshell, when the Signata application is launched it will start up a <em>Device Manager service</em> in the background. The service and the Signata application will negotiate a temporary cryptographic key pair to protect their communications using Transport Layer Security, and all messages are then sent via gRPC.</p><p>Whilst this adds a massive boost in security with all traffic encrypted, this also does one other amazing thing for the product - it's <em>blazingly fast </em>compared to the old CLI toolkit. We'll do a more technical write-up on how this works soon.</p><h2 id="updated-address-integrations">Updated Address Integrations</h2><p>We experimented with allowing non-tradable address storage in Signata, but we weren't happy with the experience if users would be unable to actually use those addresses. So we've pared the system back to supporting addresses we can actually transact with (via BlockCypher), and we've also moved our Ethereum integration to use Infura instead to provide faster transactions and future ERC-20 token integrations!</p><figure><img src="https://blog.congruentlabs.co/content/images/2020/09/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.congruentlabs.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-1.png 600w, https://blog.congruentlabs.co/content/images/2020/09/image-1.png 753w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>For now if you want to store WIFs or Private Keys of addresses that Signata doesn't support, you can always use the Secure Notes capability to store them (more on that below). If you want to see any particular currency supported, please reach out to us and let us know - we will be adding XRP support as first priority.</p><blockquote>Just a side note: if you're using MetaMask or a similar product for interacting with the Ethereum network and other coins like UNI or LINK, you can export your account from MetaMask and import it straight into Signata for more secure long-term storage.</blockquote><h2 id="dark-mode">Dark Mode</h2><p>With our newer codebase live we've now got Dark Mode support working. The application will automatically detect which mode to run in from what your Operating System has been set to. At the moment only the web browser lets you force this on or off, and we'll put it the option into the desktop application soon.</p><h2 id="instant-updates">Instant Updates</h2><p>Now that we have a tighter coupling of our desktop application with Firebase, all data in your account will now be automatically synchronized in realtime between all open clients.</p><h2 id="secure-notes">Secure Notes</h2><p>We're not trying to reinvent the wheel when it comes to password management (other products do this <em>far </em>better<em>)</em>, but if you want to store specific secrets like your password manager passphrase you can use the Secure Notes feature to encrypt your secrets using your YubiKeys. All you need to remember is your device PIN to retrieve them again.</p><h2 id="address-book">Address Book</h2><p>Signata is designed for holding cryptocurrencies long term - but eventually you'll probably want to move your currencies back out to exchanges to make trades - you can use the Address Book capability to store deposit addresses of pretty much anything, so you can then use them later for withdrawals.</p><h2 id="simplified-device-management">Simplified Device Management</h2><p>As we've developed Signata, we've identified ways to simplify adding Devices to your account. Now, all you need to do is provide your Recovery Passphrase and the PIN you wish to use with your device, and the rest is taken care of.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.congruentlabs.co/content/images/2020/09/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.congruentlabs.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-2.png 600w, https://blog.congruentlabs.co/content/images/2020/09/image-2.png 892w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="what-s-next">What's Next</h2><p>Now that we've gotten that overhaul released we'll be releasing more features soon.

    <p>This article is a heads-up for the upcoming change in the naming of Dotty artefacts (as published to Maven). Currently, the organization name is “ch.epfl.lamp” which will become “org.scala-lang”. The artefact names will be changed from “dotty-xxx” to “scala3-xxx”.</p>
<p>This change will be part of the next Dotty release planned for October 1st which will be known as Scala 3.0.0-M1. We encourage maintainers of tooling (IDEs, build tools, ...) to prepare for this change now by special-casing the way they handle the compiler when its version number starts with <code>3.</code> just like they already had to special-case versions starting with <code>0.</code> to support existing Dotty releases.</p>

Because of the way modern tech stacks are set up, it’s getting harder and harder to make sure your code is doing what it’s supposed to.</p><p>In this blog post, we’ll show you a bug that slips through the cracks today, explain why it’s nobody’s fault, and show you how we diff API behaviors to catch bugs (while generating API specs along the way!!).</p><h2>😱 The Bug That (Almost) Ruined A Friendship</h2><p>You work on a web app. Your co-worker and #bff, Aki, opened a pull request to remove a property from a commonly used API. You two are tight, so you jump in to review the PR. Aki’s PR includes a link showing that this property’s usage has been removed from the website, once again proving why Aki is your #bff. You +1 the PR enthusiastically, with both of you believing that Aki has taken into account all of the dependencies.</p><p>The change gets merged. Then: BETRAYAL! There are now outages in the mobile clients, and it’s late nights for you and Aki. (Good thing you started out liking Aki so much.) It turns out that Aki’s API had been so good that the mobile APIs had started depending on the removed property, unbeknownst to both you and Aki.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1600807765736_28487"><div>

These bugs are nasty little things: they have to do with dependencies on the code you wrote rather than the code itself, making it hard to catch them through source diffs. In fact, as soon as bugs cross API boundaries, they become extremely hard to catch because they elude common testing and software analysis (think static and dynamic analysis) solutions. Developers are left to rely on documentation, word of mouth, and crossing their fingers really hard.<br></p><h2>⚡️ Find Bugs by Diffing API Behavior</h2><p>To catch these kinds of bugs, you can simply install Akita to analyze API-impacting changes whenever you make a pull request.

September 22, 2020 | https://malloc.se/blog/zgc-jdk15 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://malloc.se/blog/zgc-jdk15">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p><a href="https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/15">JDK 15</a> was released on September 15. To celebrate the release, Oracle hosted
the virtual conference <em>Oracle Developer Live - Java</em>, where I gave a talk titled
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88E86quLmQA">ZGC - The Next Generation Low-Latency Garbage Collector</a>. If you missed the
event, all sessions were recorded and are available as video on-demand.
<a href="https://developer.oracle.com/developer-live/java/">Check them out!</a></p>

<p>In this post I will highlight some of the more interesting changes that went into <a href="https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/zgc">ZGC</a>
in JDK 15. As always, if you’re looking for additional information on ZGC, please see the
<a href="https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/zgc">OpenJDK Wiki</a>, the GC section on <a href="https://inside.java/tag/gc">Inside Java</a>, or
<a href="https://malloc.se/">this blog</a>.</p>

<h2 id="production-ready">Production ready!</h2>

<p><img width="25%" src="https://malloc.se/img/zgc-jdk15/check.png">
In JDK 15, ZGC became <em>production ready</em>. In other words, it is now a product (non-experimental) feature in the JDK and you
are encouraged to use it in production. This change came in through <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/377">JEP 377</a> and was the
culmination of several years of hard work by many people.</p>

<p>This was of course a major milestone for the ZGC project, that we’ve all been eager to reach. But rest assured that removing
the experimental status was not something we took lightly. No user would ever trust a GC that now and then corrupts the heap
or crashes the JVM. Of course, users also expect a production ready GC to perform well and offer features relevant for today’s
needs.</p>

<p>Since its initial introduction in JDK 11, ZGC has in the following releases received a number of new features, a steady stream
of performance and stability improvements, and support for all commonly used platforms. It has also gone through a lot of testing.</p>

<p>In summary, ZGC is now a stable, high performance, low-latency GC, that is ready to take on your production workloads.</p>

<h2 id="new-features-and-enhancements">New features and enhancements</h2>

<h3 id="improved-allocation-concurrency">Improved allocation concurrency</h3>

<p>Allocating a Java object is typically very fast. Exactly how a new object gets allocated depends on which GC you are using.
In ZGC, the allocation path goes through a number of tiers. The vast majority of allocations are satisfied by the first tier,
which is very fast. Only very few allocations need to go all the way down to the last tier, which is much slower.</p>

<p><img width="40%" src="https://malloc.se/img/zgc-jdk15/allocation_tiers.svg"></p>

<p>An allocation will end up in the last tier only when all of the previous tiers were unable to satisfy the allocation. This
is the last resort, where ZGC will ask the operating system to commit more memory to expand the heap. If this also fails,
or we’ve reached max heap size (<code>-Xmx</code>), then an <code>OutOfMemoryError</code> will be thrown.</p>

<p>Prior to JDK 15, ZGC held a global lock while committing (and uncommitting) memory. That of course meant that only a single
thread could expand (or shrink) the heap at any given time. Committing and uncommitting memory are also relatively expensive
operations, that can take some time to complete. As a result, this global lock sometimes became a point of contention.</p>

<p>In JDK 15, this part of the allocation path was re-worked so that this lock is no longer held while committing and uncommitting
memory. As a result, the average cost of doing an allocation in the last tier was reduced, and this tier’s ability to handle
concurrent allocations was significantly improved.</p>

<h3 id="incremental-uncommit">Incremental uncommit</h3>

<p>ZGC’s uncommit capability was initially introduced in JDK 13. This mechanism allows ZGC to uncommit unused memory to shrink
the heap, and return that unused memory to the operating system for other processes to use. For memory to become eligible for
uncommit it must have been unused for some amount of time (by default 300 seconds, controlled by <code>-XX:ZUncommitDelay=&lt;seconds&gt;</code>).
If more memory is needed at some point later, then ZGC will commit new memory to grow the heap again.</p>

<p>Uncommitting memory is a relatively expensive operation and the time it takes for this operation to complete tends to scale
with the size of the memory you’re operating on. Prior to JDK 15, it didn’t matter if ZGC found 2MB or 2TB of memory eligible
for uncommit, it would still just issue a single uncommit operation to the operating system. This turned out to be potentially
problematic since uncommitting large amounts of memory (like hundreds of gigabytes or terabytes) can take quite some time.
During this time the memory pressure could change dramatically, but there was no way for ZGC to abort or revise the uncommit
operation mid-flight. If the memory pressure increased, ZGC would first have to wait for any in-flight uncommit operation to
complete and then immediately commit some of that memory again.</p>

<p>The uncommit mechanism was re-worked in JDK 15 to uncommit memory incrementally. Instead of a single uncommit operation, ZGC
will now issue many smaller uncommit operations to the operating system. This allows a change in memory pressure to be promptly
detected and the uncommit process to be aborted or revised mid-flight.</p>

<h3 id="improved-numa-awareness">Improved NUMA awareness</h3>

<p><img width="50%" src="https://malloc.se/img/zgc-jdk15/numa.svg">
ZGC has always been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_memory_access">NUMA</a> aware on Linux, in the sense that when a
Java thread allocates an object, that object will end up in memory that is local to the CPU that Java thread is executing on.
On a NUMA machine, accessing memory that is local to the CPU results in lower
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_latency">memory latencies</a>, which in turn results in better overall performance. However,
ZGC’s NUMA awareness only came into its full potential when using large pages (<code>-XX:+UseLargePages</code>). This was addressed in
JDK 15, and ZGC’s NUMA-awareness now always comes into its full glory, regardless of whether large pages are used or not.</p>

<h3 id="jfr-events">JFR events</h3>

<p>The following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JDK_Flight_Recorder">JFR</a> events were added or are no longer marked experimental.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/83b2411fd15d0890042ede118a08731ca162b951/src/hotspot/share/jfr/metadata/metadata.xml#L1001">ZAllocationStall</a>:

<a href="https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/83b2411fd15d0890042ede118a08731ca162b951/src/hotspot/share/jfr/metadata/metadata.xml#L1023">ZRelocationSetGroup</a>:

Generated each time ZGC uncommits some unused part of the Java heap, i.e. returns that unused memory to the operating system.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/83b2411fd15d0890042ede118a08731ca162b951/src/hotspot/share/jfr/metadata/metadata.xml#L1052">ZUnmap</a>:
Generated each time ZGC unmaps memory. ZGC will asynchronously unmap memory when a set of scattered pages needs to be remapped
as a larger contiguous page.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="java-heap-on-nvram">Java heap on NVRAM</h3>

<p><img width="20%" src="https://malloc.se/img/zgc-jdk15/nvram.svg">
Advancements in the area of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-volatile_random-access_memory">NVRAM</a> have in the last few
years made such memory considerably faster and a lot cheaper. In some environments and for some types of applications,
placing the entire Java heap on NVRAM (instead of RAM) can actually be an attractive option, where you trade some performance
for cheaper memory. In fact, all GCs in HotSpot (except ZGC) have had support for this since
<a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/316">JDK 10</a>, with the <code>-XX:AllocateHeapAt</code> option. However, as of JDK 15, this is now also
supported by ZGC.</p>

<h3 id="compressed-class-pointers">Compressed class pointers</h3>

<p>In HotSpot, all Java objects have a header comprised of two fields, a <em>mark word</em> and a <em>class pointer</em>. On 64-bit CPUs,
both of these fields are normally 64 bits wide, where the <em>class pointer</em> is a plain pointer to memory that describes the
object’s class (type information, vtable, etc). The <em>Compressed Class Pointers</em> feature (<code>-XX:+UseCompressedClassPointers</code>)
helps reduce overall heap usage by reducing the size of all object headers. It does this by compressing the <em>class pointer</em>
field to 32 bits (instead of 64 bits). Instead of being a plain pointer, the <em>compressed class pointer</em> is an offset into
the <em>Compressed Class Space</em>, which has a known base address. To retrieve the real <em>class pointer</em> the JVM simply adds
the (possibly bit-shifted) <em>compressed class pointer</em> to the base address of the <em>Compressed Class Space</em>.</p>

<p>The implementation of the <em>Compressed Class Pointers</em> feature has historically been tied to the <em>Compressed Oops</em> feature,
which meant that you could not enable <em>Compressed Class Pointers</em> without also enabling <em>Compressed Oops</em>. This was just
an artificial dependency, as there are no technical reasons why you can’t enable one but not the other. Since ZGC doesn’t
support <em>Compressed Oops</em> today, it meant that ZGC was also blocked from using of <em>Compressed Class Pointers</em>, for no good
reason. In JDK 15, the artificial dependency between <em>Compressed Class Pointers</em> and <em>Compressed Oops</em> was broken, and as
a result ZGC now works nicely with <em>Compressed Class Pointers</em>.</p>

<h3 id="class-data-sharing">Class data sharing</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/vm/class-data-sharing.html">Class Data Sharing (CDS)</a> feature in HotSpot
helps reduce the startup time and memory footprint between multiple instances of the JVM. This feature only worked when
the <em>Compressed Oops</em> feature was enabled (<code>-XX:+UseCompressedOops</code>). In JDK 15, <em>Class Data Sharing</em> was enhanced to also
work when the <em>Compressed Oops</em> feature is disabled. As a result, <em>Class Data Sharing</em> now works nicely together with ZGC
(where the <em>Compressed Oops</em> feature is disabled).</p>

              <p>Today we compare the similarities and differences between timeline and text-based video editing, and we clarify what text-based video editing actually is, how it works, and what the differences and advantages are when compared to timeline editing.</p><p>But first, let me give you a bit of context.👋</p><p>Let's go back a few years. Its the late 1990s! We are in a time when video editing is experiencing a surge of innovation. In addition to the linear video editing method that was common up until then, computer-supported non-linear video editing is becoming more and more relevant. It took only a few years for non-linear video editing to establish itself as a standard and offer completely new possibilities and creativity.</p><hr><p><strong>What Happened and What Does Non-linear Editing Actually Mean? </strong></p><p>Before videos were edited with non-linear video editing software, it was a linear video editing program that was the industry standard for many years.</p><p>Linear video editing is a step-by-step, chronological process of going through a video. Scenes in a video could only be exchanged for a scene of the same length, otherwise the entire edited film had to be copied again. &nbsp;What made sense in times of analogue films is now history due to the advancement of digital video editing technology.</p><p>For all the young stars among us 🙋‍♂️ this is what linear video editing looked like back then.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/2020/09/linear-video-editing.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/linear-video-editing.jpg 600w, https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/2020/09/linear-video-editing.jpg 720w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Linear video editing system</figcaption></figure><p>With the change from analogue film to digital video formats, non-linear video editing was invented.</p><hr><p><strong>Non-linear editing </strong>(NLE) is fundamentally different. Instead of having to make edits in a pre-defined sequence, this new kind of editing allows editors to make changes whenever and wherever they like. Non-linear editing uses digital tools to enable editors to avoid the need to store multiple copies and can even integrate with modern film software.</p><p>Nowadays the whole thing looks like this: A video editing software with a user interface 👇</p><figure><img src="https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/2020/09/non-linear-editing.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/non-linear-editing.png 600w, https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/non-linear-editing.png 1000w, https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/2020/09/non-linear-editing.png 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Non-linear editing software</figcaption></figure><p><strong>The Advantages Over Linear Cutting Are Obvious:</strong></p><ul><li>More flexibility - Non-linear editing allows you to move individual segments of recorded sequences around in a drag and drop way.<br></li><li>View "work in progress" in real-time - Non-linear editing allows you to view the effects of your editing immediately after performing the action without delay, letting you test your changes. <br></li><li>Make changes without affecting the rest of the edit - Non-linear editing lets video editors make changes at any point in the video sequence without needing to lay down video in real-time. <br></li><li>Generate fewer copies - Non-linear editing stores original sequences in a smart way, reducing the need for multiple copies, saving both time and storage costs.</li></ul><hr><p><strong>But Why Am I Telling You All of This? What's Wrong With NLE?</strong></p><p>For more than 20 years, practically no innovation or improvements have occurred in the field of video editing software. Since the change from linear to non-linear editing, videos are edited with programs that have a timeline.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/2020/09/timeline.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/timeline.jpg 600w, https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/2020/09/timeline.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Timeline editing</figcaption></figure><p>However, the operation is becoming more and more complicated. Nowadays it's really difficult for a beginner to operate a video editor easily.</p><p>There's no wonder why people quickly become frustrated and end up with googling and watching hours of tutorials on how to edit a video in Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, Camtasia, etc.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/2020/09/Desperately.gif" alt=""><figcaption>Done with complicated video editor</figcaption></figure><p>A typical video editing experience is counterintuitive when compared to everything within the modern conventions of UI design and functionality. There are so many buttons, dials, knobs, settings, and keyboard shortcuts to remember, that learning how it all works becomes in and of itself an exercise in patience and resolve.</p><p><strong>Don't get me wrong!</strong> Timeline editing is absolutely fine and all the massive video editing programs are helpful and have their absolute right to exist. To be honest, for professional video production they are indispensable.</p><p>But there are video formats and situations where these video editing programs are simply over engineered and you don't need all of their functionality, as you can tell!</p><figure><img src="https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/2020/09/different-timeline-editor-interfaces.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/different-timeline-editor-interfaces.png 600w, https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/different-timeline-editor-interfaces.png 1000w, https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/different-timeline-editor-interfaces.png 1600w, https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/2020/09/different-timeline-editor-interfaces.png 1980w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Typical video editor interfaces</figcaption></figure><hr><p>For <strong>content-focused</strong> videos, you don't need most of the features offered by most editing software, and the barrier to entry is very steep - you have to own a machine capable of running these programs and know-how all of the functions work.</p><p>This is exactly where the approach of <strong>text-based video editing</strong> comes into play. But wait...what exactly is text-based editing and how does it work? 🤔</p><p>Text-based editing has become possible due to the improvement of speech recognition, which has even become increasingly better in recent years. We all know speech recognition like Siri, Alexa and co. from our smartphones and home assistants.</p><p>This technique is exactly what a text-based video editor uses. How it works can basically be broken down in three steps:</p><ol><li>You upload your video into the editor and your spoken word will be transcribed into text.📃</li><li>Edit the video by just editing the text. Cut out mistakes, bloopers or whole sentences. ✂️</li><li>When everything fits together let your video render and you are done 🎉</li></ol><p>So, you can imagine the whole editing process as if the timeline were transformed into a different representation, which is now presented as the text. Basically, it's always a matter of presenting the video sequences in such a way that you can jump from position to position and edit the video in a non-linear manner.</p><p>This is what it looks like in our video editor <strong><a href="https://typestudio.co/">Type Studio</a></strong>👇</p><figure><img src="https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/2020/09/Type-Studio-Interface.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/Type-Studio-Interface.png 600w, https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/Type-Studio-Interface.png 1000w, https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/2020/09/Type-Studio-Interface.png 1485w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Type Studio tool interface</figcaption></figure><p>Now you may object that a text-based editor can only edit those areas where words are spoken. Currently this is true, but we are working on detecting breaks and making them editable. So stay tuned for our next updates! 🎉</p><hr><p><strong>For Which Kind of Video is a Text-based Editor Suitable?</strong></p><p>Type Studio offers advantages over timeline approaches when it comes to content-focused videos in which people speak. This includes videos such as: </p><ul><li>Tutorials</li><li>Explainer Videos</li><li>Content Marketing Videos</li><li>Social Media Videos </li><li>Online Courses</li><li>Recorded Lectures &amp; Seminars</li><li>Journalism Videos</li><li>Customer Success Videos</li><li>Recorded Zoom Meetings</li></ul><p>Cutting your content-focused video with a text-based editor is not only much easier and requires no video editing skill at all, but it's also much faster and you can simultaneously scrub through the video using the transcribed text to jump to any position.</p><p>Type Studio also offers a whole range of other advantages. Since the transcribed text is already available, subtitles can be added to your video with just one click. Translation into different languages is also possible. Another popular feature is the ability to easily export the transcribed video to have the content of the video in written form.</p><hr><p>Let us sum it all up! Text-based editing is the new kid on the block 😎</p><figure><img src="https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/2020/09/text-based-editing-new-kid-on-the-block.gif" alt=""><figcaption>Text-based video editing</figcaption></figure><p>Non-linear editing, which until now has only been implemented in the form of a timeline, will be supplemented. The approach and user interaction of text-based editing is completely new and shows its advantages in content focused videos.</p><p>Give it a shot and edit your video text-based with 👉 <a href="https://typestudio.co/">typestudio.co</a> </p>

  <div>

    <div id="parent-fieldname-text"><p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">“Performance-based measurements describe how older people manage in their daily life, and at the same time, the measurements reflect one’s functional age,” says the principal investigator of the study, Professor <strong>Taina Rantanen.</strong></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Among men and women between the ages of 75 and 80, muscle strength, walking speed, reaction speed, verbal fluency, reasoning and working memory are nowadays significantly better than they were in people at the same age born earlier. In lung function tests, however, differences between cohorts were not observed. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">“Higher physical activity and increased body size explained the better walking speed and muscle strength among the later-born cohort,” says doctoral student <strong>Kaisa Koivunen</strong>, “whereas the most important underlying factor behind the cohort differences in cognitive performance was longer education.” </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Postdoctoral researcher <strong>Matti Munukka</strong> continues: “The cohort of 75- and 80-year-olds born later has grown up and lived in a different world than did their counterparts born three decades ago. There have been many favourable changes. These include better nutrition and hygiene, improvements in health care and the school system, better accessibility to education and improved working life.”</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The results suggest that increased life expectancy is accompanied by an increased number of years lived with good functional ability in later life. The observation can be explained by slower rate-of-change with increasing age, a higher lifetime maximum in physical performance, or a combination of the two.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">“This research is unique because there are only a few studies in the world that have compared performance-based maximum measures between people of the same age in different historical times,” says Rantanen.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">“The results suggest that our understanding of older age is old-fashioned. From an aging researcher’s point of view, more years are added to midlife, and not so much to the utmost end of life. Increased life expectancy provides us with more non-disabled years, but at the same time, the last years of life comes at higher and higher ages, increasing the need for care. Among the ageing population, two simultaneous changes are happening: continuation of healthy years to higher ages and an increased number of very old people who need external care.”</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The study was conducted at the Faculty of Sport and Health Sciences and Gerontology Research Center at University of Jyväskylä, Finland. The first cohort data were collected between 1989 and 1990 and consisted of 500 people born between 1910 and 1914. The second cohort data were collected from 2017 to 2018 and comprised 726 people born in 1938 or 1939 and 1942 or 1943. In both cohorts, the participants were assessed at the age 75 or 80 years. Participants were recruited from the Digital and Population Data Services Agency. The study was funded by the Academy of Finland and the European Research Council.</span></p>

<p>Pinterest was once hailed as one of the <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Tumblr and Pinterest now fastest-growing social platforms" href="https://mashable.com/2014/11/26/tumblr-pinterest-fast-growing/">most promising social networks</a> in the world. However, in a world dominated by Facebook and Instagram, it became one of the "other social apps" that some people use along with Snapchat and Twitter. However, the world suddenly changed for Pinterest last week: Pinterst became one of the most downloaded apps in the world overnight, and the reasons behind this sudden rise could be a huge difference maker for the company.</p>
<h2>Pinterest Skyrockets to One of the Most Downloaded Apps in the World</h2>
<p>On Saturday September 19th 2020, something strange happened to Pinterest: Pinterest suddenly skyrocketed to the top of the Apple App Store's ranking of the most popular applications. This was especially surprising given that Pinterest's app have generally hovered around top 30 to 50 in the ranking in the past. Not only that, it has been more popular than even apps like Instagram, TikTok and Zoom in some major markets like the US, the UK and Singapore. That it seems to be getting more downloads (on Apple devices) than TikTok is very important due to the importance of younger demographics for social networks: teenagers have historically been trend setters, and popularity among them have foreshadowed meteoric rise of various social platforms like Instagram, Snapchat and Tiktok.</p>

<p>And this trend was not isolated to just a few countries. We found that Pinterest's popularity is skyrocketing in dozens of countries around the world, all occurring around the same time. Is Pinterest reinventing itself as the next hot thing in the global social media industry?</p>

<h2>Apple the Kingmaker: iOS 14's Customizable Theme &amp; Teens</h2>
<p>It turns out that gold literally may have fallen on its lap when Apple <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="iOS 14 is available today" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/09/ios-14-is-available-today/">released its new operating system</a> iOS 14 on September 16th. iOS 14' new feature that allows users to customize their home screens &amp; icons has been so popular that it has created its own theme of TikTok videos garnering over 2 billion views in the past few days already.</p>
<div>
<p><img alt="Videos with #iOS14 hashtags on TikTok already garnered more than 2bn views since in a week" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/valuechampion/image/upload/c_limit,dpr_1.0,f_auto,h_1600,q_auto,w_420/v1/Image_from_iOS_prwm9h" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/valuechampion/image/upload/c_limit,dpr_1.0,f_auto,h_1600,q_auto,w_420/v1/Image_from_iOS_prwm9h 1x, https://res.cloudinary.com/valuechampion/image/upload/c_limit,dpr_2.0,f_auto,h_1600,q_auto,w_420/v1/Image_from_iOS_prwm9h 2x">

</div>
<p>And where are teens looking for the perfect images for inspirations? They are flocking to Pinterest to share &amp; discover ideas to jump on the bandwagon. A simple search on Twitter for "ios 14 pinterest" shows a plethora of results where people are sharing their latest iPhone background &amp; icon themes, and they are all using Pinterest to do so.</p>
<div>

<h2>What Does This Mean for Investors?</h2>
<p>This renewed interest for Pinterest could literally be a fountain of youth and opportunity for the company and its investors. Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and Pinterest all make money on advertisements, and more eyeballs means more revenue for them. Of course, iOS 14's new homescreen customization could be a fad that ends once everyone has set their backgrounds. However, this could last much longer than one might think. First, Android could introduce a similar feature to compete, which will prolong the trend for much longer. Also, now that that consumers, especially younger ones, are seeking to use Pinterest en masse globally, the company now has a chance that it would have not easily gotten otherwise to engage a massive set of new users, experience an immediate boost to its growth and to find new use cases for product in the long run.</p>

<p>Not only that, such an inflow of affluent (i.e. Apple users) and trend setting consumers could be the weapon Pinterest needs in its arsenal to engage more advertisers. Currently, Pinterest's current valuation of $22bn is significantly lower than all other social media platforms, largely due to the fact that <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Pinterest vs Twitter vs Snapchat: What You Need to Know Before Investing in the IPO" href="https://www.valuechampion.sg/pinterest-vs-twitter-vs-snapchat-what-you-need-know-investing-ipo">its revenue remains lower</a>, as we wrote prior to Pinterest's IPO. If Pinterest is able to take advantage of this sudden tailwind (their management should be actively looking for ways to do so), its business has an enormous amount of value to be gained. How they jump on the opportunity is definitely worth closely monitoring over the next few quarters.</p>

			<p><span>Austin City Council member Jimmy Flannigan knows his city is lucky.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p><span>The fourth-largest city in Texas suffered a nasty shock at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic when Mayor Steve Adler canceled its signature event, South by Southwest.&nbsp; </span><span>The annual ten-day extravaganza draws luminaries from the entertainment, tech and media industries and </span><a href="https://explore.sxsw.com/hubfs/2019%20SXSW%20Economic%20Impact%20Analysis%20-%2011.18.19%20OPT.pdf"><span>brings over $350 million</span></a><span> to Austin’s economy.</span>
</p><figure id="attachment_638" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-638"><img src="https://citymonitor.ai/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2020/09/GettyImages-1226093815-1.jpg" alt="A view of downtown Austin, Texas.

<p><span>Flannigan is the former head of the city’s LGBT Chamber of Commerce, and he immediately rallied venue and bar owners to discuss the economic fallout. But the loss of the conference, and its tens of thousands of attendees, was quickly eclipsed by, well, everything else.&nbsp;</span>											</p>
									 
			
<p><span>“There was the cancel South by stage, where we all thought, ‘This is going to suck, but it’s not coming here,’” says Flannigan. “Then very quickly, you realize that this is a globally interconnected city and Southy by is not the problem. In a short period of time, it became clear that this was going to be shutting down a lot more than music venues.”</span>
</p><p><span>The cancellation of South By Southwest was one of those moments, like the National Basketball Association’s decision to pause its season, when Americans started realizing the pandemic wasn’t just happening somewhere else. But in the months since, Austin is looking like one of the luckiest urban areas in the United States. Unemployment in the city <a href="https://www.statesman.com/business/20200918/austin-jobless-rate-keeps-improving-down-to-55">fell to 5.5% in August</a> – far lower even than other wealthy US cities such as San Francisco or New York. After a 20% year-over-year dive, sales tax revenues are recovering (although they have not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels). Austin is one of the only major cities in Texas that hasn’t furloughed or laid off public-sector workers thanks, in part, to the city’s approach to addressing another crisis roiling the US: Black Lives Matter and the demand for police reform.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p><span>But despite the relatively sunny outlook, Austin faces the same daunting dilemmas as do other cities across the United States.</span>
</p><p><span>“I think most cities are basically going to be broke for the foreseeable future,” says Bill Fulton, director of the Kinder Institute for Urban Research at Rice University in Houston. “I’ve been the mayor of a city, and if you lose 10 to 15 percent of revenue, it is impossible to maneuver or do anything. In a situation like this, you see a rapid drop in revenue and very slow restoration. And it’s impossible to know what business travel and the tourist economy is going to do in the years ahead.”</span>
</p><p><span>To make matters worse, for many cities the fallout from the Great Recession never ended. Although the Obama administration’s stimulus package in 2009 provided aid to state and local governments, it ran dry in 2011. Revenues continued falling for years, only bottoming out in 2014.</span>
</p><p><span>Economists such as Amanda Page-Hoongrajok, an assistant professor of economics and finance at Saint Peter’s University, argue that austerity at the local and state level fully offset the federal stimulus during the Great Recession. That’s part of why the recovery took so long and was so uneven: In cities and regions that weren’t doing as well, those public sector jobs never fully came back. That meant a lot of private sector jobs that relied on them died too.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p><span>“Pretty much any spending cuts at the state and local level are going to be a huge drag on the overall economic recovery,” says Page-Hoongrajok. “If state and local governments are condensing their balance sheets, they’re laying people off. They’re cutting spending on equipment. Capital spending is cut early during downturns. All of that is sucking demand right out of the economy.”</span>
</p><figure id="attachment_642" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-642"><img src="https://ind-dev-newstatesman-b2b.pantheonsite.io/citymonitor/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2020/09/GettyImages-112145276.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://citymonitor.ai/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2020/09/GettyImages-112145276.jpg 1024w, https://citymonitor.ai/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2020/09/GettyImages-112145276-768x512.jpg 768w, https://citymonitor.ai/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2020/09/GettyImages-112145276-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-642"><span>Thousands of union members from around Michigan rally at the State Capitol to protest Governor Rick Snyder’s proposed budget cuts in April 13, 2011.

<p><span>Compared to many other rich nations, America governs itself with a relatively messy form of federalism. The powers of federal, state and local government all overlap somewhat, which means the higher branches can sometimes leave the lower ones to fend for themselves. Unless Congress steps in, it’s up to state and local governments to balance their own ledgers. This time, despite the massive stimulus efforts put forward in Washington, the only lifeline was a $150 billion cut of the $2.2 trillion CARES Act, which then had to be split between states, cities, and tribal governments. The funds could only be spent on efforts to ameliorate the pandemic.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p><span>That did nothing for the Covid-sized hole blown in municipal budgets by skyrocketing unemployment, declining sales taxes, and the overnight evisceration of revenue derived from pandemic-vulnerable sources like hotel and liquor taxes. As the pandemic rages, some governmental duties require less input, but public responsibilities like social services grow more costly.</span>
</p><p><span>Without further federal aid, this will pose a problem for many localities. Left to their own devices, the layers of American government below the federal level have a limited toolkit. States cannot print their own money and many have balanced budget requirements. Even those that don’t have explicit strictures about the need for current revenues to cover expenditures are afraid to get too creative with their financing for fear of making the costs of borrowing more expensive.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p><span>Cities governments, meanwhile, live at the whim of their states and face even tighter restrictions. In cases like Austin, where state governments are of a different ideological persuasion than municipal politicians, the ability of liberal local leaders to raise taxes can be limited by conservative elected officials in the statehouse. Their borrowing capabilities are even more tightly constrained than the states, because their tax bases are much smaller and predecessor city governments have </span><a href="https://www.citymetric.com/politics/pandemic-economy-could-revive-one-america-s-ugliest-fights-over-local-control-5147"><span>suffered fiscal crises</span></a><span> after being disciplined by the bond markets.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p><span>That just leaves current revenues on the table, which are looking precarious. The mainstay of municipal finance, property taxes, mostly haven’t been paid yet this year. But the National Association of Counties reports that 27% of respondents to their membership polling have already experienced a lag in collection or a decline in revenue from this usually reliable source. Experts fear that property taxes won’t bring in what they once did in the medium term either. What owner of a mostly empty commercial office building won’t be challenging their assessment?&nbsp;</span>
</p><p><span>In </span><a href="https://www.nlc.org/sites/default/files/users/user57221/City_Fiscal_Conditions_2020_FINAL.pdf"><span>a mid-August report</span></a><span>, the National League of Cities outlined the dire reality facing its membership. Almost 90% of cities anticipated being less able to meet their needs in fiscal year 2021, while the hundreds surveyed anticipated an average 13% decline in general fund revenues. </span><a href="https://covid19.nlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/What-Covid-19-Means-For-City-Finances_Report-Final.pdf"><span>A third of the nation’s</span></a><span> three million city workers are expected to be furloughed, laid off, or required to serve on reduced pay. In April alone, almost 800,000 jobs in local governments were lost. Employment in the sector has been growing again since June, but it lags overall job growth.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p><span>All of this has been a nasty shock for a sector that only just recovered from the last (supposedly) once-in-a-generation crisis a little over a decade ago. Page-Hoongrajok says inflation adjusted state and local government spending did not return to pre-Great Recession levels until 2019. Public sector employment has fallen back to the same level it was in the 1990s, when the US population was roughly 60 million people fewer than it is today. Many key services were never restored to pre-Great Recession levels: infrastructure spending is at </span><a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/state-budget-and-tax/its-time-for-states-to-invest-in-infrastructure"><span>a 70-year low point</span></a><span> while capital spending on schools is </span><a href="https://www.cbpp.org/blog/with-federal-funding-unreliable-states-must-invest-in-school-buildings"><span>below what it was in 2008. </span></a><span>&nbsp;</span>

<p><span>Fulton remembers the pain of the Great Recession well. In the late 2000s, he served as mayor of Ventura, California, a city of just over 100,000 people midway between Santa Barbara and Los Angeles.</span>
</p><p><span>Ventura’s experience during the Great Recession was harrowing: Fulton recalls the city’s tax revenues plunging almost 15% overnight. It took years to restore, despite the city’s relative affluence – today Ventura’s median income is almost $13,000 higher than the national average.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
</p><p><span>The downturn turned the position of mayor into a depressing bookkeeping exercise. Instead of cutting ribbons at new parks and infrastructure projects, Fulton spent his days cutting budgets and, more painfully, staff. Austerity proved even more painful elsewhere in the state. Cities across California’s Central Valley, which has not prospered alongside the coastal regions, eliminated their planning departments and never replaced them.</span>
</p><p><span>In Fulton’s estimation, there is an order to how local politicians implement austerity measures. First, they put a halt to capital projects and, then, services. The </span><a href="https://www.naco.org/sites/default/files/documents/Analysis-of-COVID-19s-Impact-on-County-Finances-and-Implications-for-the-US-Economy.pdf"><span>National Association of Counties found</span></a><span> that 71% of its members have already cut back on capital spending and 68% on services. Then non-personnel spending goes. After that, staff is cut through attrition, as job vacancies open up but go unfilled.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p><span>“The second to last resort is that they cut staff, they lay people off,” says Fulton, “and then the last resort, when everything else falls, they actually start to rethink what they do.”&nbsp;</span>
</p><p><span>Fulton says that an emergency of this magnitude will force cities to make hard decisions. But it can also provide an opportunity to change long established ways of operating that have proven resistant to crusading council members or activist campaigns.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p><span>In Austin, easily the most left-wing city in Texas, the city government patched holes in municipal finances and funded needed city services by redistributing some of the police department’s budget. In the midst of the Black Lives Matter protests this summer, activists demanded moving funds – and responsibilities …</span></p></div></div>

September 22, 2020 | https://wimvanderbauwhede.github.io/articles/universal-interpreter-part-1/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wimvanderbauwhede.github.io/articles/universal-interpreter-part-1/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content" itemprop="articleBody">
				<p>This is the first part of an article in my series about functional programming in general and algebraic data types and function types in particular in <a href="https://raku.org/">Raku</a>. It builds on my earlier articles on <a href="https://wimvanderbauwhede.github.io/articles/roles-as-adts-in-raku/">algebraic data types in Raku</a> and their use in the practical example of <a href="https://wimvanderbauwhede.github.io/articles/list-based-parser-combinators/">list-based parser combinators</a>. It also makes heavily use of <a href="https://wimvanderbauwhede.github.io/articles/function-types">function types</a>.</p>

<p>If you are not familiar with functional programming or with Raku, I suggest you read my introduction <a href="https://wimvanderbauwhede.github.io/articles/decluttering-with-functional-programming/">"Cleaner code with functional programming"</a>. If you are not familiar with algebraic data types or function types, you might want to read the other articles as well. </p>

<p>In this article, I want to explain a technique called <a href="http://okmij.org/ftp/tagless-final/course/Boehm-Berarducci.html">Böhm-Berarducci encoding</a> of algebraic data types. The link above is to Oleg Kiselyov's explanation, which makes for interesting reading but is not required for what follows. Oleg says:</p>

<p><em>"Boehm-Berarducci's paper has many great insights. Alas, the generality of the presentation makes the paper very hard to understand. It has a Zen-like quality: it is incomprehensible unless you already know its results."</em></p>

<p>Fortunately, to follow the explanation in this article, you don't need to read either Böhm and Berarducci's  original paper or Oleg's explanation. For the purpose of this article, it is sufficient to say that the Böhm-Berarducci encoding is a way to encode an algebraic data type as a function type. This means that the data itself is also encoded as a function. As a result, the function encoding the data type becomes a "universal interpreter". This makes it is easy to create various interpreters for algebraic data types. </p>

<p>In this first part, I will explain a way to implement Böhm-Berarducci (BB) encoding using roles in Raku, with basic examples. In <a href="https://wimvanderbauwhede.github.io/articles/universal-interpreter-part-2">the second part</a> I will show how to use BB encoding to construct a 'universal interpreter' which makes it very easy to create specific interpreters for complex data structures. </p>

<h2>The basic idea behind the Böhm-Berarducci encoding</h2>

<p>The basic idea behind the Böhm-Berarducci (BB) encoding is to create a type which represents a function with an argument for every alternative in a sum type.
Every argument is itself a function which takes as arguments the arguments of each alternative product type, and returns a polymorphic type. Because the return type is polymorphic, we decide what it will be when we use the BB type. In this way a BB-encoded data structure is a generator for whatever type we like, in other words it is a universal interpreter. </p>

<p>For example, if we define a sum type <code>S</code> with three alternatives <code>A1</code>, <code>A2</code> and <code>A3</code>, using the same notation as in the article on <a href="https://wimvanderbauwhede.github.io/articles/roles-as-adts-in-raku/">algebraic data types in Raku</a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span></span><span>datatype</span> <span>S</span> <span>=</span> <span>A1</span> <span>Int</span> <span>|</span> <span>A2</span> <span>String</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>|</span> <span>A3</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>then the corresponding BB type will be</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span></span><span>datatype</span> <span>S</span> <span>=</span> <span>S</span> <span>(</span> <span>∀</span> <span>a</span> <span>.</span>
    <span>-- A1 Int</span>
    <span>(</span><span>Int</span> <span>⟶</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>⟶</span> 
    <span>-- A2 String</span>
    <span>(</span><span>String</span> <span>⟶</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>⟶</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>⟶</span> 
    <span>-- A3</span>
    <span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>⟶</span> 
    <span>-- The return type</span>
    <span>a</span>
    <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I have put parentheses to show which part of the type is the function type corresponding to each alterative. 
Because the constructor for <code>A3</code> takes no arguments, the corresponding function signature in the BB encoding is simply <code>a</code>: a function which takes no arguments and returns something of type <code>a</code>. The final <code>a</code> is the return value of the top-level function: every type alternative is an argument to the function. When applying the function, it must return a value of a given type. This type is <code>a</code> because <code>a</code> is the return type of every function representing an alternative. I will explain the <code>∀ a .</code> later.</p>

<h2>Some simple examples</h2>

<p>Let's look at a few examples to see how this works in practice.</p>

<h3>OpinionatedBool: an enum-style sum type</h3>

<p>In a <a href="https://wimvanderbauwhede.github.io/articles/roles-as-adts-in-raku/">previous post</a> I showed how you can use Raku's <em>role</em> feature to implement algebraic data types. I gave the example of 
<code>OpinionatedBool</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span></span><span>datatype</span> <span>OpinionatedBool</span> <span>=</span> <span>AbsolutelyTrue</span> <span>|</span> <span>TotallyFalse</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>which in Raku becomes</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>role</span> <span>OpinionatedBool</span> {}
<span>role</span> <span>AbsolutelyTrue</span> <span>does</span> <span>OpinionatedBool</span> {}
<span>role</span> <span>TotallyFalse</span> <span>does</span> <span>OpinionatedBool</span> {}
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is a sum type with two alternatives. </p>

<p>The type declaration of the BB type lists the types of all the arguments representing the alternatives. As in this case the constructors for the alternatives take no arguments, the corresponding functions also take no arguments:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span></span><span>datatype</span> <span>OpinionatedBoolBB</span> <span>=</span> <span>OpinionatedBoolBB</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>∀</span> <span>a</span> <span>.</span> 
      <span>a</span> <span>-- AbsolutelyTrue</span>
    <span>⟶</span> <span>a</span> <span>-- TotallyFalse</span>
    <span>⟶</span> <span>a</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In <a href="https://haskell.org/">Haskell</a>, we would implement this type as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span></span><span>newtype</span> <span>OpinionatedBoolBB</span> <span>=</span> <span>OpinionatedBoolBB</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>unBoolBB</span> <span>::</span> <span>forall</span> <span>a</span> <span>.</span> 
       <span>a</span> <span>-- AbsolutelyTrue</span>
    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>-- TotallyFalse</span>
    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>You don't need to know any Haskell for what follows, but as the Raku implementation is closely modeled on the Haskell one, it is worth explaining a bit.
The <code>newtype</code> keyword in Haskell is used to declare types with a single constructor. What we have here is a record type with a single field, and this field has the accessor function <code>unBoolBB</code>, which is a convenience to allow easy access to the function encoded in the type. The <code>∀ a</code>  or <code>forall a</code> allows us to introduce a type parameter that is only in scope in the expression on the right-hand side. Because the Haskell notation is so close to the formal notation, I will from now on use the Haskell notation.</p>

<p>In Raku, we can implement this  BB type minimally as a parametric role with a method with a typed signature:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>role</span> <span>BoolBB</span>[<span>&amp;b</span>] {
    <span>method</span> <span>unBoolBB</span>(<span>Any</span> \<span>t</span>, <span>Any</span> \<span>f</span> --&gt; <span>Any</span>) {
        <span>b</span>(<span>t</span>,<span>f</span>);
    }
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>This tells us a lot:</p>

<ul>
<li>the parameter to the role has an <code>&amp;</code> sigil so it of type <code>Callable</code> (i.e. it is a function)</li>
<li>the method's type tells us that there are two arguments of type <code>Any</code>. The method itself also returns a value of type <code>Any</code>, i.e. there is no constraint on the type of the return value. </li>
</ul>

<p>With this implementation, the type safety is not quite as strong as in Haskell, where we guarantee that all these return values will be of the same type. The main purpose for using the types here is to make it provide documentation. We can enforce the type safety at a different point if desired.</p>

<p>Now, the whole idea is that this role <code>BoolBB</code> will serve the same purpose as my <code>OpinionatedBool</code>. So instead of saying</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>my</span> <span>OpinionatedBool</span> \<span>trueOB</span> = <span>AbsolutelyTrue</span>;
</code></pre></div>
<p>I want something like </p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>my</span> <span>BoolBB</span> \<span>trueBB</span> = <span>BBTrue</span>;
</code></pre></div>
<p>So in this example, <code>BBTrue</code> will be an instance of <code>BoolBB</code> with a specific function as parameter. Let's call that function <code>true</code>, so we have</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>my</span> \<span>BBTrue</span> = <span>BoolBB</span>[ <span>true</span> ].<span>new</span>;
</code></pre></div>
<p>and similar for the <code>false</code> case. We can make this a little nicer using a helper function to create <code>BoolBB</code> instances:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>sub</span> <span>bbb</span>(\<span>tf</span> --&gt; <span>BoolBB</span>) { <span>BoolBB</span>[ <span>tf</span> ].<span>new</span> };
</code></pre></div>
<p>In this way we can write</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>sub</span> <span>BBTrue</span> { <span>bbb</span> <span>true</span> } 
<span>sub</span> <span>BBFalse</span> { <span>bbb</span> <span>false</span> }
</code></pre></div>
<p>In this particular case, because none of the constructors takes any arguments, we can also write this as</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>my</span> <span>BoolBB</span> \<span>BBTrue</span> = <span>bbb</span> <span>true</span>;
<span>my</span> <span>BoolBB</span> \<span>BBFalse</span> = <span>bbb</span> <span>false</span>;
</code></pre></div>
<!-- ∀ -->

<p>The question is then: what are the functions <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>? We know they are of type <code>a ⟶ a ⟶ a</code>; an obvious choice is:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>my</span> \<span>true</span>  = -&gt; <span>Any</span> \<span>t</span>, <span>Any</span> \<span>f</span> --&gt; <span>Any</span> { <span>t</span> }
<span>my</span> \<span>false</span> = <span>sub</span> (<span>Any</span> \<span>t</span>,<span>Any</span> \<span>f</span> --&gt; <span>Any</span> ) { <span>f</span> }
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is the same choice we made in <a href="https://wimvanderbauwhede.github.io/articles/everything-is-a-function/">the article "Everything is a function"</a>. In fact, these are simply <em>selector</em> functions which select the first or second argument. </p>

<p>In practice, we often want to convert between BB types and their algebraic counterparts.</p>

<ul>
<li>To turn a Bool into a BoolBB:</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>sub</span> <span>boolBB</span> (<span>Bool</span> \<span>tf</span> --&gt; <span>BoolBB</span>){ <span>tf</span> ?? <span>BBTrue</span> !! <span>BBFalse</span> }
</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>To turn the BB Boolean into an actual Boolean:</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>sub</span> <span>bool</span>(<span>BoolBB</span> \<span>b</span> --&gt; <span>Bool</span>) { 
    <span>b</span>.<span>unBoolBB</span>( <span>True</span>, <span>False</span>) 
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>So we have:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>say</span> <span>bool</span> <span>BBTrue</span>; <span># =&gt; True</span>
<span>say</span> <span>bool</span> <span>BBFalse</span>; <span># =&gt; False</span>
<span>say</span> <span>bool</span> <span>boolBB</span>( <span>bool</span> <span>BBTrue</span>); <span># =&gt; True</span>
<span>say</span> <span>bool</span> <span>boolBB</span>( <span>bool</span> <span>BBFalse</span>); <span># =&gt; False</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>(Note that this works with either way of defining <code>BBTrue</code> and <code>BBFalse</code> because calling a function without arguments in Raku does not require parentheses.)</p>

<p>We can do this more OO-like by making <code>bool</code> a method of <code>BoolBB</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>role</span> <span>BoolBB</span>[<span>&amp;b</span>] {
    <span>method</span> <span>unBoolBB</span>(<span>Any</span> \<span>t</span>, <span>Any</span> \<span>f</span> --&gt; <span>Any</span>) {
        <span>b</span>(<span>t</span>,<span>f</span>);
    }

    <span>method</span> <span>bool</span>() { 
        <span>self</span>.<span>unBoolBB</span>( <span>True</span>, <span>False</span>) 
    }
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>Then we can say</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>say</span>  <span>BBTrue</span>.<span>bool</span>; <span># =&gt; True</span>
<span>say</span>  <span>BBFalse</span>.<span>bool</span>; <span># =&gt; False</span>
<span>say</span>  <span>boolBB</span>( <span>bool</span> <span>BBTrue</span>).<span>bool</span>; <span># =&gt; True</span>
<span>say</span>  <span>boolBB</span>( <span>bool</span> <span>BBFalse</span>).<span>bool</span>; <span># =&gt; False</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>and I'm sure those dots will make some people happy.</p>

<p>Note however that we do not really need the <code>bool</code> method, instead we can simply compare the types:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>say</span>  <span>trueBB</span> ~~ <span>BBTrue</span>; <span># =&gt; True</span>
<span>say</span>  <span>BBFalse</span> ~~ <span>trueBB</span>; <span># =&gt; False</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We can generalise this approach as an alternative to arbitrary enums. For example, and <code>RGB</code> enum can be written very easily as a BB type:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>role</span> <span>RGB</span>[<span>&amp;b</span>] {
    <span>method</span> <span>unRGB</span>(<span>Any</span> \<span>r</span>, <span>Any</span> \<span>g</span>, <span>Any</span> \<span>b</span> --&gt; <span>Any</span>) {
        <span>b</span>(<span>r</span>,<span>g</span>,<span>b</span>);
    }
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>with selector functions </p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>my</span> \<span>red</span>  = -&gt; \<span>r</span>,\<span>g</span>,\<span>b</span> { <span>r</span> }
<span>my</span> \<span>green</span> = -&gt; \<span>r</span>,\<span>g</span>,\<span>b</span> { <span>g</span> }
<span>my</span> \<span>blue</span> = -&gt; \<span>r</span>,\<span>g</span>,\<span>b</span> { <span>b</span> }
</code></pre></div>
<p>However, the main reason for using BB types is to make it easier to perform computations on the data structure encoded in the type. Constant sum types like <code>Bool</code> and <code>RGB</code> don't store data to compute on, except in the most trivial way, and are therefore not the main target of this encoding. I presented them only because they are the easiest ones to explain.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://wimvanderbauwhede.github.io/articles/universal-interpreter-part-2">second part</a> of the article presents a worked example. But first, let's look at a few more simple examples explaining more features of the BB approach.</p>

<h3>The <code>Maybe</code> type: a sum type with a polymorphic argument</h3>

<p>The Boolean type above had two constructors without arguments. A simple algebraic data type where one of the constructors has an argument is the <code>Maybe</code> type:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span></span><span>data</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>b</span> <span>|</span> <span>Nothing</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This type is used to express that a function does not always return a value of a given type. For example, if we look up a key in a map, it is possible that there is no entry for that key. So using <code>Maybe</code> we could write a safe lookup function:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>sub</span> <span>safeLookup</span>(<span>%v</span>,<span>$k</span> --&gt; <span>Maybe</span>) {
    <span>if</span>  (<span>%v</span>{<span>$k</span>}:<span>exists</span>) {
        <span>Just</span>[<span>%v</span>{<span>$k</span>}].<span>new</span>;
    } <span>else</span> {
        <span>Nothing</span>;
    }
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>Maybe</code> type is polymorphic, so we have instances of <code>Maybe</code> for any type we like.  In Haskell:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span></span><span>newtype</span> <span>MayBB</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>MayBB</span> <span>{</span>
<span>unMayBB</span> <span>::</span> <span>forall</span> <span>a</span> <span>.</span>  
<span>(</span><span>b</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>-- Just b </span>
<span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>-- Nothing </span>
<span>-&gt;</span>…</code></pre></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>On Wednesday September 23, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission is about to advance a policy to mandate that large employers have at least 60 percent of their employees telecommute on any given work day. <br></p>



<p>The goal of the policy is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and traffic congestion.&nbsp;  The new policy for a 60% mandate was added to the PlanBayArea Blueprint this summer, based on community feedback during the Covid Shelter-In-Place period. This is not proposed as a Covid emergency measure, but as a permanent mandate.</p>



<p>The MTC will vote on Wednesday to include this policy in their environmental review of the region’s long range transportation plan, the PlanBayArea BluePrint.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As of yet, this is only a “strategy” not a policy. In order to turn this into a policy in the future, there would need to be many details worked put, plus legislative authorization.   But it is being used in the PlanBayArea to fill the gap to meet the region’s greenhouse gas emission goals. </p>



<p>At the MTC’s policy advisory council and in discussions with Bay Area workers, concerns were raised by parents of young children, people with living environments without space and quiet for a home office, more junior employees who want to build relationships to succeed and advance at their jobs, and members of minority groups concerned that remote work will make it harder to overcome bias.</p>



<p>The telework mandate strategy came from public feedback over the summer on the PlanBayArea Blueprint. Some community members, seeing the huge drop in commute traffic that came from the pandemic shelter-in-place orders, thought that congestion could be permanently eased by mandating that workers stay at home after it is safe to work in offices.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.greencaltrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bbc-dad.jpeg" alt=""></figure>



<p>Instead of an inflexible telework mandate that poses burden on many workers,  a strategy a requiring lower car commute rate would also advance the greenhouse gas goals, and provide more flexibility for workers and employers – enabling people to take transit, or bike to work, or telecommute.  </p>



<p>If you agree that greater flexibility allowing employees to work from home is a good idea but a 60% telework mandate  goes way too far, please send email to <a href="mailto:info@bayareametro.gov">info@bayareametro.gov</a> by 5pm on Tuesday.&nbsp; Please address your message to MTC Commissioners, reference agenda #8a, and say a sentence or two in your own words, and if relevant with a 1-2 sentence personal story.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Update. If you can make a public comment sometime between 10 and 12, you can use the <a href="https://bayareametro.zoom.us/j/98665548899">Zoom link here</a>. The meeting will be <a href="https://twitter.com/alevin%22">livetweeted here</a> so you can see when public comment is up. </p>

You can find it in the <a href="https://mtc.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=801212&amp;GUID=B6220A08-A844-46FC-A85A-EB6BE078610F&amp;Options=info|&amp;Search=">meeting materials</a> by downloading the PlanBayArea item and searching for Strategy EN7.<a href=""></a></p>

<p><img src="https://blog.robenkleene.com/assets/2020-09-20-vs-code-hero.png" alt="VS Code Hero"></p>

<p>The most important thing I look for when choosing which tools to use is longevity. Learning software is an investment, and if you have to switch to another application later, you lose some of that investment.</p>

<p>In most software categories, choosing the software with longevity is easy, the most popular tools <a href="https://blog.robenkleene.com/2020/04/27/software-to-die-for/">are usually the ones that have been around the longest</a>. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel">Microsoft Excel</a> and <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html">Adobe Illustrator</a> were both released in 1987 and, for the most part, they’ve remained the most popular software in their categories since then.</p>

<p>Text editors, on the other hand, are a software category where the most popular options are not the oldest. According to the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/">Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey</a>, <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> was the most popular text editor available on the Mac from 2015–2017. Sublime Text was released in 2008, a sprightly youth compared to Excel and Illustrator. Text editors have been a category with a lot of movement: In the last 20 years, TextMate, Sublime Text, and Atom have all been the text editor with the most momentum<sup id="fnref:whytexteditorshavechurn" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:whytexteditorshavechurn">1</a></sup>. For big complicated desktop software, has any other category ever had so much movement?</p>

<p>I believe the era of new text editors emerging and quickly becoming popular has now ended with <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>. VS Code has reached unprecedented levels of popularity and refinement, laying a foundation that could mean decades of market dominance. If, like me, one of your priorities for your tools is longevity<sup id="fnref:whynotemacsandvim" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:whynotemacsandvim">2</a></sup>, than that means VS Code might be a great text editor to invest in learning today.</p>

<p>The case for VS Code’s longevity comes from several points we’ll cover in this piece:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="#popularity"><strong>Popularity</strong></a>: It’s crossed a popularity threshold that no earlier text editor in recent history has crossed.</li>
  <li><a href="#the-text-editor-as-platform"><strong>The Text Editor as Platform</strong></a>: It’s the endgame of a revolution that saw text editors be remade around extensions.</li>
  <li><a href="https://blog.robenkleene.com/2020/09/21/the-era-of-visual-studio-code/paradigm-transcendence"><strong>Paradigm Transcendence</strong></a>: It’s transcended its paradigm as a desktop app by becoming a hosted web app, and even a reference implementation.</li>
  <li><a href="https://blog.robenkleene.com/2020/09/21/the-era-of-visual-studio-code/company-management"><strong>Company Management</strong></a>: It’s managed by a powerful tech company, and it’s being developed <em>aggressively</em>.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="popularity">Popularity</h2>

<p>VS Code is the most popular text editor today. It’s so popular, that it could be the most popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">GUI</a> programming tool of all time. <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2015#tech-editor">Since 2015</a>, Stack Overflow has included questions about text editors in their survey<sup id="fnref:stackoverflowremovedthetexteditorquestions" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:stackoverflowremovedthetexteditorquestions">3</a></sup>. Back then <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> was the most popular text editor, with 34.7% of respondents saying they were “likely to use it”. In the following years, the popularities of different text editors moved around a bit, but nothing ever broke the 40% mark. That is, until its <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#development-environments-and-tools">most recent poll in 2019</a>, when VS Code jumped to 50.7%. This was the second year in a row that VS Code increased by ~45%, this time jumping from <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#development-environments-and-tools">34.9% in 2018</a>, where <em>it had already been the most popular</em>.</p>

<h3 id="text-editor-popularity-20152019">Text Editor Popularity 2015–2019</h3>

<p><img src="https://blog.robenkleene.com/assets/2020-09-20-text-editor-popularity.png" alt="Text Editor Popularity"></p>

<p>(Note that Stackoverflow started allowing multiple answers between 2015 and 2016, so I’d take the changes between those two years in particular with a grain of salt.)</p>

<h2 id="the-text-editor-as-platform">The Text Editor as Platform</h2>

<p>So VS Code is objectively wildly popular; the next point we’re going to look at is more qualitative. For the past couple of decades, text editors have been on a trajectory that I believe VS Code is the final representation of. This is the progression of text editors becoming platforms in their own right by increasing the role and capabilities of extensions. What follows is the history of this progression<sup id="fnref:texteditorprogessionpreviously" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:texteditorprogessionpreviously">4</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="pre-2004-bbedit-emacs-and-vim">Pre-2004: BBEdit, Emacs, and Vim</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html">BBEdit</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>, and <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> are all great text editors in their own right, but they all have idiosyncrasies that (while beloved by people like me) prevent them from ever being the <em>most popular</em> text editor.</p>

<p>Emacs, and Vim’s predecessor Vi, were both first released in 1976, before many of todays user-interface conventions were solidified. Predating conventions like using a modifier key with <code>Z</code>, <code>X</code>, <code>C</code>, and <code>V</code> for undo, cut, copy, and paste (keyboard shortcuts that were popularized by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh#1978%E2%80%9384:_Development_and_introduction">original Macintosh</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_1.0">Windows 1.0</a>, released in 1984 and 1985 respectively). Neither Emacs<sup id="fnref:cuamodeinemacs" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:cuamodeinemacs">5</a></sup> or Vim use these keys, and instead use their own terminology. They both use the term “yank” for example (although to mean different things, it’s copy in Vim, and paste in Emacs).</p>

<p>BBEdit was released in 1992, around the time that some of the first GUI tools emerged that would become dynasties. Note the proximity to Excel (1987), Illustrator (1987), and Photoshop (1990). And just like those apps, BBEdit is still relevant today. But unlike those apps, it’s not the most popular in its category, by a wide margin. The reason seems to be at least partially that it never fully adapted to a world where text editors put so much emphasis on package-driven ecosystems.</p>

<h3 id="2004-textmate">2004: TextMate</h3>

<p>TextMate, released in 2004, is arguably the most influential text editor ever. Among the numerous features it popularized are <a href="https://macromates.com/manual/en/snippets">abbreviation-based snippets</a>, <a href="https://macromates.com/manual/en/working_with_text#auto-paired_characters_quotes_etc">automatic paired characters</a>, and <a href="https://macromates.com/manual/en/working_with_multiple_files#moving_between_files_with_grace">fuzzy finding by file name</a>. All of these features became staples in every popular text editor that followed. The implementations of <a href="https://macromates.com/manual/en/scope_selectors">Scope Selectors</a> and <a href="https://macromates.com/manual/en/themes">theming</a> that TextMate pioneered have also formed the basis for themes and syntax highlighting in every subsequent popular text editor.</p>

<p>That’s already a lot to originate from a single app, but it still doesn’t even include TextMate’s most significant innovation; the one that would go on to re-shape text editors, solidify niche status for every text editor that came before it, and pave the way for VS Code to become the most popular text editor in history a decade later. TextMate’s most important innovation was that it was the first popular text editor that was primarily built around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_%28computing%29">extensions</a>.</p>

<p>While TextMate popularized the concept of a text editor built around extensions, in hindsight, it didn’t go far enough. TextMate’s extensions had limitations that later text editors would thrive by removing.</p>

<h3 id="2008-sublime-text">2008: Sublime Text</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>, released in 2008, popularized the minimap and multiple cursors. And unlike TextMate and BBEdit, it’s cross-platform, running on Linux, MacOS, and Windows, which helped it reach a wider audience than those editors. But Sublime Text’s biggest impact was greatly expanding the capabilities of extensions.</p>

<p>Sublime Text’s extensions run in an embedded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a> runtime with an <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/api_reference.html">extensive API</a>, unlike TextMate which <a href="https://github.com/textmate/bundle-support.tmbundle/blob/13169c6209ebb02564009c4ce573d62452c9b3ae/Support/shared/bin/ruby18">uses the scripting languages built-in to macOS</a>, and <a href="https://macromates.com/manual/en/appendix#plug-in_api">rather than having a proper extension API</a>, mainly centers on processing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams">standard out</a>.</p>

<p>Sublime Text greatly expanded what extensions could do, allowing more sophisticated integrations such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)">linters</a> that included GUI components. And <a href="https://packagecontrol.io/news">Package Control</a>, the enormously popular package manager for Sublime Text built by <a href="https://twitter.com/wbond/">Will Bond</a><sup id="fnref:sublimehqhire" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:sublimehqhire">6</a></sup>, features a centralized source for package management, reducing the friction to browse, install, and update packages; a model that all subsequent popular text editors would also adopt.</p>

<p>Even with Sublime Text’s expanded extensions, it still didn’t go far enough. Package Control wasn’t built-in, and, while Sublime Text does have an API, its use of Python with custom calls for GUI components still left room for future text editors to make extensions more accessible to build.</p>

<h3 id="2014-atom">2014: Atom</h3>

<p><a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>, released by <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> in 2014, finally brings extensions to their final form. Atom’s package manager is built in<sup id="fnref:textmate2hasabuiltinbundlebrowser" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:textmate2hasabuiltinbundlebrowser">7</a></sup>, displays extension <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README">READMEs</a> complete with inline images (and early extensions made by GitHub themselves popularized the convention of using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF">animated GIFs</a> to illustrate functionality), creating an extension experience reminiscent of an <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/app-store/">app store</a>.</p>

<p>Then there’s the matter of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a>. Atom is built on <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a><sup id="fnref:electronwasmadeforatom" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:electronwasmadeforatom">8</a></sup>, which means the editor itself is written in JavaScript and runs on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js">Node</a><sup id="fnref:atomwaswrittenincoffeescript" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:atomwaswrittenincoffeescript">9</a></sup>. Compared to Sublime Text’s Python API; HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are some of most widely-known languages in existence, which greatly lowers the barrier of entry for creating extensions.</p>

<p>Atom had essentially perfected the extension-based editor, there was just one problem: It’s slow. Performance complaints have plagued Atom since its release, and market ended up split with Sublime Text, which is lightning fast by comparison.</p>

<h3 id="2015-visual-studio-code">2015: Visual Studio Code</h3>

<p>VS Code was released in 2015, based on the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/">Monaco Editor</a> that Microsoft had <a href="https://weblogs.asp.net/jongalloway/a-quick-look-at-the-new-visual-studio-online-quot-monaco-quot-code-editor">first released in 2013</a> that could be embedded into websites. When GitHub released Electron along with Atom. Microsoft used it to create a desktop version of the Monaco Editor called Visual Studio Code.</p>

<p>VS Code takes the same formula as Atom<sup id="fnref:vscodeislesshackable" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:vscodeislesshackable">10</a></sup>—a local web-based text editor written in Electron with an emphasis on extensions—and makes it more performant. VS Code makes extensions even more visible, by putting them in the sidebar, raising to the same level as file browsing, searching, source control, and debugging. VS Code extensions can have rich user-interfaces, being written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and with full-access to <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a>, they can essentially do anything any other application can do. And indeed, <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GrapeCity.gc-excelviewer">some</a> <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio">extensions</a> start to look like apps in and of themselves.</p>

<p>With VS Code, the extension-based text editor has seemingly reached its final form. Ever since TextMate, extensions have increased in prominence and capabilities, and with VS Code, that progression appears to have culminated. There just isn’t anywhere else to go. Correspondingly, there isn’t a way a new text editor can leapfrog VS Code the same way previous text editors have been leapfrogging each other by improving extensions.</p>

<h2 id="paradigm-transcendence">Paradigm Transcendence</h2>

<p>So far we’ve looked at VS Code’s popularity, and its extensions implementation, as indicators of longevity. The third indicator we’ll look at is how VS Code has moved beyond the confines of the desktop. The <a href="https://github.com/cdr/code-server"><code>code-server</code></a> project runs VS Code as a regular web app, in other words, hosted on a server and accessed through the browser. GitHub’s <a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces/">Codespaces</a> also run VS Code as a web app, this time by spinning up an ad hoc development environment.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__next"><div><h2>Blogging on Next.js: Generating static index pages</h2><p>This is a sort of meta-post about how I hacked a simple blogging system on top of <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a>.</p><p>Since I was building a website that talked about the JavaScript ecosystem, I naturally wanted a blog engine that:</p><ul><li>Generated a pure static site</li><li>Was uncomplicated, unopinionated, and easily hackable</li><li>Worked with React</li></ul><p>I've been a big fan of Next since it's release, so much so that I wanted to try using it as a publishing system.</p><p>I'd dabbled with libraries like <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/">Gatsby</a>, but decided it wasn't for me. I found Gatsby's API to be <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/browser-apis/">overwhelmingly</a> <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/ssr-apis/">large</a> and <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/graphql-api/">complex</a>. I love the project's mission, and can see Gatsby being really useful for a big organization, but I like APIs with <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching">small footprints</a> that mostly fit in my ever-depleting memory.</p><p>One of Next's core (and controversial) features is its PHP-style <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction">filesystem-based routing</a>. This makes writing a new blog post as easy as creating a new file. I chose author my posts in MDX - a superset of markdown that allows you to sprinkle in React components. By adding <a href="https://mdxjs.com/getting-started/next">@next/mdx</a> to my <code>next.config.js</code>, Next rendered all those MDX files with it's file-based routing. Pretty sweet.</p><p>Unfortunately, there was one missing piece that I still needed - a way to collect a list of all my posts and generate an index page.</p><p>My goal was to create an <code>index.tsx</code> file, and leverage it's <code>getStaticProps</code> definition to generate a fully static index page at build-time.</p><p>Basically, I wanted something as easy as this:</p><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> getPages <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'helpers/paths'</span><span>;</span>

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> getStaticProps<span>:</span> <span><span>GetStaticProps</span></span> <span>=</span> <span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>{</span>
    props<span>:</span> <span>{</span> posts<span>:</span> <span>await</span> <span>getPages</span><span>(</span><span>'blog'</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span><span>Index</span></span> <span>(</span><span><span>{</span>posts<span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  
</code></pre><p>Here's how I did I with a few lines of code.</p><h2>0. Create a post metadata format</h2><p>MDX files can specify a <code>meta</code> export with information about the document - think of this as Markdown's frontmatter, but in JavaScript. This is a convenient spot to store stuff like a post's title, publish date and relevant tags. Here's an example of this post's meta:</p><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>const</span> meta <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  pub<span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
  title<span>:</span> <span>'Blogging on Next.js: Fun with static props'</span><span>,</span>
  date<span>:</span> <span>'2020-08-01T01:43:16Z'</span><span>,</span>
  tags<span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>'typescript'</span><span>,</span> <span>'tricks'</span><span>,</span> <span>'meta'</span><span>]</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>


</code></pre><p>In order to generate my index page, I had to collect the metadata from these every MDX file in my <code>/blog</code> directory. Fortunately, Next made this a breeze.</p><h2>1. Reading the filesystem</h2><p>Getting a list of posts was dead-simple - just use Node's <code>fs</code>. Since <code>getStaticProps</code> is always executed in a Node.js environment, you have access to any standard lib or NPM module you need.</p><pre><code><span>import</span> path <span>from</span> <span>'path'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> promises <span>as</span> fs <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'fs'</span><span>;</span>

<span>export</span> <span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>getPages</span><span>(</span>
  <span>rootPath<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span></span>
<span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>Promise</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Post</span><span>[</span><span>]</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> postFileNames <span>=</span> <span>await</span> fs<span>.</span><span>readdir</span><span>(</span>rootPath<span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre><p>Now that I was equipped with a list of file names, I had to figure out how to load and parse all these MDX files. At first I thought I had to read the files and find a runtime MDX parser, but then I wondered <em>can I lean on <code>@next/mdx</code>?</em></p><h2>2. Dynamically loading post metadata</h2><p>It turns out <code>@next/mdx</code> <em>patches Next's module loader</em> to make MDX a first-class citizen! Importing an MDX file transpiles it to JS under the hood - the plugin ever overloads dynamic <code>require</code> calls:</p><pre><code><span>const</span> posts<span>:</span> <span>Post</span><span>[</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> postFileNames<span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> blogPostModule <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>../pages/</span><span><span>${</span>rootPath<span>}</span></span><span>/</span><span><span>${</span>name<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre><p>Again, all this happens at <em>build time</em>!</p><p>From here, I can just iterate over the modules and return the metadata:</p><pre><code><span>const</span> posts<span>:</span> <span>Post</span><span>[</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> postFileNames<span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> blogPostModule <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>../pages/</span><span><span>${</span>rootPath<span>}</span></span><span>/</span><span><span>${</span>name<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> slug <span>=</span> path<span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span>name<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> urlPath <span>=</span> <span><span>`</span><span>/</span><span><span>${</span>rootPath<span>}</span></span><span>/</span><span><span>${</span>slug<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>blogPostModule<span>.</span><span>meta</span><span>,</span>
    path<span>:</span> urlPath<span>,</span>
    slug<span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>return</span> posts<span>;</span>
</code></pre><p>That's it! I'm really impressed with the level of power and flexibility Next exposes to the developer, and how I could replicate a lot of the value found in Gatsby without the excessive configuration or any layers of abstraction. I'm really excited to see the platform evolve, and to improve my index page strategy with new features like <a href="https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-4#incremental-static-regeneration-beta">incremental static regeneration</a>.</p><p>Stay tuned to learn how I extended this feature to <strong>statically generate an RSS feed</strong>.</p></div></div></div>]]>

		<p>Over the last few weeks I ported the <a href="https://github.com/jiixyj/libebur128/"><code>libebur128</code></a> C library to <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, both with a proper Rust API as well as a 100% compatible C API.</p>
<p>This blog post will be split into 4 parts that will be published over the next weeks</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Overview and motivation</strong></li>
<li>Porting approach with various details, examples and problems I ran into along the way</li>
<li>Performance optimizations</li>
<li>Building Rust code into a C library as drop-in replacement</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re only interested in the code, that can be found on <a href="https://github.com/sdroege/ebur128">GitHub</a> and in the <code data-enlighter-language="raw">ebur128</code> crate on <a href="https://crates.io/crates/ebur128">crates.io</a>.</p>
<p>The initial versions of the <code data-enlighter-language="raw">ebur128</code> crate was built around the <code data-enlighter-language="raw">libebur128</code> C library (and included its code for ease of building), version 0.1.2 and newer is the pure Rust implementation.</p>


<h2><span id="EBU_R128">EBU R128</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jiixyj/libebur128/"><code>libebur128</code></a> implements the <a href="https://www.ebu.ch/">EBU</a> <a href="https://tech.ebu.ch/docs/r/r128.pdf">R128</a> loudness standard. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBU_R_128">Wikipedia</a> page gives a good summary of the standard, but in short it describes how to measure loudness of an audio signal and how to use this for loudness normalization.</p>
<p>While this intuitively doesn’t sound very complicated, there are lots of little details (like how human ears are actually working) that make this not as easy as one might expect. This results in there being many different ways for measuring loudness and is one of the reasons why this standard was introduced. <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">Of course</a> it is also not the only standard for this.</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw">libebur128</code> is also the library that I used in the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-rs/-/blob/dc8b722f72a82e5c0819f9f67cc59c7a491d4110/audio/audiofx/src/audioloudnorm.rs">GStreamer loudness normalization plugin</a>, about which I <a href="https://coaxion.net/blog/2020/07/live-loudness-normalization-in-gstreamer-experiences-with-porting-a-c-audio-filter-to-rust/">wrote</a> a few weeks ago already. By porting the underlying loudness measurement code to Rust, the only remaining C dependency of that plugin is <a href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/">GStreamer</a> itself.</p>
<p>Apart from that it is used by <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">FFmpeg</a>, but they include their own modified copy, as well as many other projects that need some kind of loudness measurement and don’t use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReplayGain">ReplayGain</a>, another older but widely used standard for the same problem.</p>
<h2><span id="Why">Why?</span></h2>
<p>Before going over the details of what I did, let me first explain why I did this work at all. <code data-enlighter-language="raw">libebur128</code> is a perfectly well working library, in wide use for a long time and probably rather bug-free at this point and it was already possible to use the C implementation from Rust just fine. That’s what the initial versions of the <code data-enlighter-language="raw">ebur128</code> crate were doing.</p>
<p>My main reason for doing this was simply because it seemed like a fun little project. It isn’t a lot of code that is changing often so once ported it should be more or less finished and it shouldn’t be much work to stay in sync with the C version. I started thinking about doing this <a href="https://github.com/sdroege/ebur128/issues/1">already</a> after the initial release of the C-based <code data-enlighter-language="raw">ebur128</code> release, but after reading <a href="https://jneem.github.io/nnnoiseless/">Joe Neeman’s</a> blog post about porting another C audio library (<a href="https://github.com/xiph/rnnoise">RNNoise</a>) to Rust this gave me the final push to actually start with porting the code and to follow through until it’s done.</p>
<p>However, don’t go around and ask other people to rewrite their projects in Rust (don’t be rude) or think that your own rewrite is magically going to be much faster and less buggy than the existing implementation. While Rust saves you from a big class of possible bugs, it doesn’t save you from yourself and usually rewrites contain bugs that didn’t exist in the original implementation. Also getting good performance in Rust requires, like in every other language, some effort. Before rewriting any software, think about the goals of this rewrite realistically as well as the effort required to actually get it finished.</p>
<p>Apart from fun there were also a few technical and non-technical reasons for me to look into this. I’m going to just list two here (curiosity and portability). I will skip the usual Rust memory-safety argument as that seems less important with this code: the C code is widely used for a long time, not changing a lot and has easy to follow memory access patterns. While it definitely had a memory safety bug (see above), it was rather difficult to trigger and it was fixed in the meantime.</p>
<h3><span id="Curiosity">Curiosity</span></h3>
<p>Personally and at my company <a href="https://www.centricular.com/">Centricular</a> we try to do any new projects where it makes sense in Rust. While this worked very well in the past and we got great results, there were some questions for future projects that I wanted to get some answers, hard data and personal experience for</p>
<ul>
<li>How difficult is it to port a C codebase function by function to Rust while keeping everything working along the way?</li>
<li>How difficult is it to get the same or better performance with idiomatic Rust code for low-level media processing code?</li>
<li>How much bigger or smaller is the resulting code and do Rust’s higher-level concepts like iterators help to keep code concise?</li>
<li>How difficult is it to create a C-compatible library in Rust with the same API and ABI?</li>
</ul>
<p>I have some answers to all these questions already but previous work on this was not well structured and the results were also not documented, which I’m trying to change here now. Both to have a reference for myself in the future as well as for convincing other people that Rust is a reasonable technology choice for such projects.</p>
<p>As you can see the general pattern of these questions are introducing Rust into an existing codebase, replacing existing components with Rust and writing new components in Rust, which is also relates to my work on the Rust <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer-rs">GStreamer bindings</a>.</p>
<h3><span id="Portability">Portability</span></h3>
<p>C is a very old language and while there is a standard, each compiler has its own quirks and each platform different APIs on top of the bare minimum that the C standard defines. C itself is very portable, but it is not easy to write portable C code, especially when not using a library like <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/glib/">GLib</a> that hides these differences and provides basic data structures and algorithms.</p>
<p>This seems to be something that is often forgotten when the portability of C is given as an argument against Rust, and that’s the reason why I wanted to mention this here specifically. While you can get a C compiler basically everywhere, writing C code that also runs well everywhere is another story and C doesn’t make this easy by design. Rust on the other hand makes writing portable code quite easy in my experience.</p>
<p>In practice there were three specific issues I had for this codebase. Most of the advantages of Rust here are because it is a new language and doesn’t have to carry a lot of historical baggage.</p>
<h4>Mathematical Constants and Functions</h4>
<p>Mathematical constants are not actually part of any C standard. While most compilers just define <code data-enlighter-language="raw">M_PI</code> (for π), <code data-enlighter-language="raw">M_E</code> (for 𝖾) and others in <code data-enlighter-language="raw">math.h</code> nonetheless as they’re defined by <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/math.h.html">POSIX</a> and <a href="http://www.unix.org/version2/unix98.html">UNIX98</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/math-constants">Microsoft’s MSVC doesn’t</a>, but instead you have to <code data-enlighter-language="raw">#define _USE_MATH_DEFINES</code> before including <code>math.h</code>.</p>
<p>While not a big problem per-se, it is annoying and indeed caused the initial version of the <a href="https://github.com/sdroege/ebur128/commit/4b9b83f04a74bad6e148ec2548a97fec8c63ab9e"><code>ebur128</code></a> Rust crate to not compile with MSVC because I forgot about it.</p>
<p>Similarly, which mathematical functions are available depends a lot on the target platform and which version of the C standard is supported. An example of this is the <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/log10.html"><code>log10</code></a> function to calculate the base-10 logarithm. For portability reasons, <code data-enlighter-language="raw">libebur128</code> didn’t use it but instead calculated it via the natural logarithm (<code>ln(x) / ln(10) = log10(x)</code>) because it’s only available in POSIX and since C99. While C99 is from 1999, there are still many compilers out there that don’t fully support it, again most prominently MSVC until very recently.</p>
<p>Using <code data-enlighter-language="raw">log10</code> instead of going via the natural logarithm is faster and more precise due to floating point number reasons, which is why the Rust implementation uses it but in C it would be required to check at build-time if the function is available or not, which complicates the build process and can easily be forgotten. <code data-enlighter-language="raw">libebur128</code> decided to not bother with these complications and simply not use it. Because of that, some <a href="https://github.com/sdroege/ebur128/blob/a72f2aed6bf12da2fd9bac10c9478a5b13495c09/src/utils.rs#L23-L35">conditional code</a> in the Rust implementation is necessary for ensuring that both implementations return the same results in the tests.</p>
<h4>Data Structures</h4>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw">libebur128</code> uses a linked-list-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)">queue</a> data structure. As the C standard library is very minimal, no collection data structures are included. However on the BSDs and also on Linux with the GNU C library there is one available in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/queue.3.html"><code>sys/queue.h</code></a>.</p>
<p>Of course MSVC does not have this and other compilers/platforms probably won’t have it either, so <code data-enlighter-language="raw">libebur128</code> included a local copy of that queue implementation. Now when building, one has to decide whether there is a system implementation available or otherwise use the internal version. Or simply always use the internal version.</p>
<p>Copying implementations of basic data structures and algorithms into every single project is ugly and error-prone, so let’s maybe not do that. C not having a standardized mechanism for dependency handling doesn’t help with this, which is unfortunately why this is very common in C projects.</p>
<h4>One-time Initialization</h4>
<p>Thread-safe one-time initialization is another thing that is not defined by the C standard, and depending on your platform there are different APIs available for it or none at all. <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/pthread_once.html">POSIX</a> again defines one that is widely available, but you can’t really depend on it unconditionally.</p>
<p>This complicates the code and build procedure, so libebur128 simply did not do that and did its one-time initializations of some global arrays every time a new instance was created. Which is probably fine, but a bit wasteful and probably strictly-speaking according to the C standard not actually thread-safe.</p>
<p>The initial version of the <a href="https://github.com/sdroege/ebur128/commit/3a329b96fad613434a001dce01d159e141aa3382"><code>ebur128</code></a> Rust crate side-stepped this problem by simply doing this initialization once with the API <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Once.html">provided</a> by the Rust standard library. See part 2 and part 3 of this blog post for some more details about this.</p>
<h4>Easier to Compile and Integrate</h4>
<p>A Rust port only requires a Rust compiler, a mixed C/Rust codebase requires at least a C compiler in addition and some kind of build system for the C code.</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw">libebur128</code> uses <a href="https://cmake.org/"><code>CMake</code></a>, which would be an additional dependency so in the initial version of the <code data-enlighter-language="raw">ebur128</code> crate I went via <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/">cargo</a>‘s <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html"><code>build.rs</code></a> build scripts and the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cc"><code>cc</code></a> crate as building <code data-enlighter-language="raw">libebur128</code> is easy enough. This works but build scripts are problematic for integration of the Rust code into other build …</p></div></article></div>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>tl;dr - This essay is broken into four sections: 1) why I’m learning Japanese, 2) some basics about Japanese alphabets, 3) what makes it a hard language to learn, and 4) the tools I’m using to learn it. If you just want to know about that last bit feel free to scroll down to the bottom.</p><p>I've always wanted to learn another language. For years, I would pick up Duolingo and mess around with it for a few weeks before moving on to something else. Then, a little over a year ago, my best friend decided that he wanted to learn Japanese. While I’d love to say that being able to speak Japanese has been a lifelong dream, my motivation is slightly less pure. Specifically, I took the fact that Japanese is, by some accounts,<a href="https://effectivelanguagelearning.com/language-guide/language-difficulty/"> the most difficult language</a> an English speaker can attempt to learn, as a personal challenge.</p><p>This changed the shape of my learning journey. Now, instead of trying to optimize for short-term usage, I was headed down a path that would take years to complete. Knowing that was surprisingly <em>helpful</em> with my motivation, as it changed my whole perspective around comprehension, ensuring the time took to learn new things didn't get me down. I was finally equipped for my language journey: I had motivation, a partner, and time, and that is all you need. Or so I thought.</p><h6 id="if-you-re-already-familiar-with-the-japanese-you-can-probably-skip-this-section-"><strong>If you're already familiar with the Japanese, you can probably skip this section.</strong></h6><p>For readers who are not familiar with the Japanese language, I'll take a brief interlude to explain some foundations. There are three character sets, two of which are phonetic (like the English alphabet), meaning that they each have a specific sound. The first is called<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana"> hiragana</a>(ひらがな) and is the most basic/ubiquitous of the three. The second is called<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana"> katakana</a>(カタカナ) and generally has more specialized usage. For every hiragana, there is a corresponding katakana. They are generally used to represent "loan words" like バス(basu) for "bus" or パン(pan) for "bread" (from Portuguese). Having multiple phonetic alphabets sounded very strange to me at first, until I realized that English has <em>also</em> has two (not counting cursive)! Look at each letter in "bard" compared to "BARD" to see what I mean.</p><p>The final character set,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji"> Kanji(漢字)</a>, is the one that most people have heard of. It is also one of the most daunting aspects of learning Japanese. There are roughly 50,000 Kanji, but the vast majority of them are no longer in use. The Japanese government maintains a set of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_j%C5%8Dy%C5%8D_kanji"> 2,136 Kanji</a> that must be taught at school but most educated Japanese adults know somewhere from 3-4,000 (I can't find any official numbers on this). If you work in a specialized field like medicine, or if you are an academic, that number can go as high as 6,000! I'll talk more about Kanji and their challenges a bit further on.</p><p>Grammatically, Japanese is about as different as you can get from English. The sentence structure is so different that you essentially have to think in reverse (some resources even<a href="http://www.textfugu.com/season-1/japanese-grammar-with-yoda/"> teach the basics with Yoda</a>). As you learn more advanced/casual grammar, you find out that things can go in pretty much whatever order you want. This does not help in the slightest. Prepositions (in, at, on) in English are post-positioned in Japanese and have little in common. Plurality is complicated; In English, "book" is unequivocally singular. In Japanese, 本(hon), isn't plural or singular, plurality is indicated by context, or by adding qualifying words. I could go on, but I say all this only to explain that learning Kanji isn't the only barrier involved in learning Japanese.</p><h6 id="back-to-the-topic-at-hand"><strong>Back to the topic at hand</strong></h6><p>It became clear to me pretty quickly that Duolingo just wasn't going to cut it. The concepts didn't map well to the Japanese language and, in all honesty, I think Duolingo's framework just isn't challenging enough in general. This realization started my search for better tools. I had learned that multiple-choice/drag and drop questions are not an effective way to study languages. You need to be "producing" and "translating". Additionally, to learn Japanese you need to use tools that are tailored to Asian languages, or better yet the Japanese language itself. These two conditions knock out a lot of the most popular contenders like Duolingo, and Memrise. I'm not suggesting that those tools don't have value, or that they aren't a good place to start, but that there are more effective tools out there.</p><p>I'll spare you the whirlwind tour of every other tool that I tried and ultimately cast aside and skip ahead to the good stuff. What I ultimately discovered is that, at least for Japanese, you need to front-load Kanji and vocabulary. I've heard many people talk about this, and it is clear that they know it is true, but have trouble articulating <em>why</em> it is true. Luckily, I think I'm at a point where I can explain the issue. Keep in mind, this is not meant to discourage, only to explain why trying to just dive into Japanese probably won't get you very far.</p><p>You can learn to "read" English, with its relatively simple phonetic alphabet in a matter of days. Your pronunciation will often be wrong, and you certainly won't know what all the words mean, but you can turn <em>symbols</em> into <em>sounds</em> from an early stage. What this means is that, generally speaking, trying to remember a word that you <em>see</em> is the same as remembering a word that you <em>hear</em>. This same parallel isn't true for Japanese, because of Kanji. It typically takes <em>at least</em> a year, and typically longer, for an adult to learn the Joyo Kanji (what Japanese children learn in school). If you're presented a word that contains a Kanji that you've never seen before, there is no good way to know how it sounds. There are some patterns/tricks you can use to make decent guesses but this method is not reliable. This prevents you from trying to remember if you've ever "heard" this new word before. Worst of all, if you can figure out the <em>meaning</em> of this new word from context, you still won't know how to <em>say</em> that word to someone else.</p><p>To put this in context, there is a site called NHK Easy News that presents a simplified version of Japanese news articles. I know 1000 kanji currently, and that represents ~90% of the Kanji that they use on NKH Easy News. That may sound like a lot but having to stop on every 10th word to look it up, and not being able to turn these unknown words into sounds to help you remember/let you access your auditory memory makes trying to read without a really good grasp of Kanji <em>extremely</em> tiring. The thing I didn't mention yet: "Knowing" a kanji doesn't mean you know how to say it in every context. For example, the Kanji "人" in "人類", "一人", "芸人" is read differently for each (jin, ri, nin)! So I know 90% of the Kanji, but do I know 90% of all of the ways they use Kanji? Probably not.</p><p>Again, this wasn't meant to discourage you, but to show the merits of this approach.</p><p>I'm still just barely intermediate at Japanese but I believe this "stack" is going to take me well into the realm of high-intermediate/advanced, and give me an excellent foundation to continue my learning from. The magic in all of these tools is that they use an SRS or "Spaced Repetition System", that is designed to quiz you on things that you've learned <em>just before</em> you forget them. You'll be amazed at how much you can stuff into your brain using an SRS. <em>All</em> of the tools I use are based around an SRS. Prioritize these tools in descending order. The workflow is simple: If you have <em>any</em> pending reviews or lessons in a higher priority one, do those first. Get back to the other tools if/when you have time.</p><h3 id="wanikani"><a href="https://www.wanikani.com/"><strong>WaniKani</strong></a></h3><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/B3G8yObyz0PrZ5os9g4YTR5JdV-OsNPJaQJP4MEqaeuqELDsVOK9YA8VGeFoLYG1H6kveL7IdTwoDRRQmLQf7F9g_HnhX51LWBsDnMWwoOzJcsUI--3aIBwxhu3jGBSyuyxJpTml"></figure><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/voMiV_sz5ydmSwC-JBBG5potzafcgR0Z7CYuP1Bttc9fRZ37zaRB9T888DQ1xnoytJjm6ZCfT4Ww1_wkbYIGsLoEwOQMXxyW7dcZ5d4cR3bmi_Lsmy8O-gUVUjciwDK29WSZq56Y"></figure><p>WaniKani is a system that teaches you most of the Joyo Kanji, and ~6000 vocabulary words in an order tailored to English speaking adults. Their website will explain much better than I could. Wanikani is very much a "point and shoot" solution and it works wonders. Do your lessons when you have time, and do your reviews when they come up, and your Kanji and vocabulary knowledge will skyrocket.</p><h3 id="kamesame"><a href="https://www.kamesame.com/"><strong>KameSame</strong></a></h3><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/3PLjw0J7OAlXE0OeK6egSpssbSdNfbP-JLevLn0AQIWmvyBkysUlqombhqB8LIbSfJnnmwy1sq6G0zlrUY0smmkZxdY0RgEVQKvUEAIUKxNzYA2cP5iqClyuUhkxo9ckvnnFax3E"></figure><p>WaniKani doesn't do everything. Specifically, it doesn't present you with the English translation of a vocabulary word and have you provide the Japanese word with the same meaning. Luckily, a tool was developed that integrates with WaniKani to provide exactly that. This takes your vocabulary learning to the next level. Just using WaniKani will set you up well for reading/listening, but with KameSame, you'll find yourself able to locate Japanese words on demand, which is (naturally) crucial for speaking.</p><p>Since I started using it, the creator has added a whole host of tools that will make it an extremely useful tool to have in your arsenal, even after you've completed WaniKani. This is one to keep your eye on. Unlike WaniKani, you add lessons at your own pace here with no real cap, so be careful not to get overzealous.</p><h3 id="bunpro"><a href="https://bunpro.jp/"><strong>Bunpro</strong></a></h3><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/AjdQ-zWy-Nj6ZaMlebYPjW__bDJkac-KZR4bQ_ONbLzrjmvakGFW_uoly16ctKGu_4tEXmpGUxv8eKsv1IGEI3YuwYKW2ySI3yoaM9gUvfe_VC15RVk1_QsC5DxO9LirCU6VHxph"></figure><p>I said Kanji/Vocab <em>first</em> but not <em>only</em>. Bunpro is an amazing tool for learning grammar via practice. I've never seen anything quite like it, but it embodies the SRS system even while presenting you with different variations of the grammar you are reviewing. In the same way that KameSame will amp up your word production, using Bunpro for a couple of months will have you expressing ideas and building sentences that aren't just "subject-object-verb".</p><p>Sources:</p><p><a href="https://www.fluentu.com/blog/japanese/japanese-sentence-structure-patterns/">https://www.fluentu.com/blog/japanese/japanese-sentence-structure-patterns/</a></p><p><a href="https://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/how-many-kanji.html">https://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/how-many-kanji.html</a></p>

				<p>This is the second in a series of posts in which I share my advice for candidates interviewing for tech companies, drawing on my experience as an engineer and interviewer at Google. If you haven’t already, take a look at the <a href="https://alexgolec.dev/introducing-google-interview-questions-deconstructed/">introduction</a> to this series.</p><p><em>Before I start, a disclaimer: while interviewing candidates is one of my professional responsibilities, this blog represents my personal observations, my personal anecdotes, and my personal opinions. Please don’t mistake this for any sort of official statement by or about Google, Alphabet, or any other person or organization.</em></p><p>This was the first problem I used during my interviewing career, and it was also the first to leak and get banned. I like it because it hits number of sweet spots:</p><ul><li>It’s easy to state and understand.</li><li>It has a number of solutions, each requiring varying degrees of algorithms and data structures knowledge. Also, a little bit of insight goes a long way.</li><li>Each solution can be implemented in relatively few lines, making it perfect for a time-constrained environment.</li></ul><p>If you’re a student or otherwise applying to tech jobs, my hope is that you’ll come away from reading this with a better understanding of what to expect from interview problems. If you’re an interviewer, I’d like to share my thought process and stylistic approach to interviewing, the better to inform others and solicit comments.</p><p>Note I’ll be writing code in Python. I like Python because it’s easy to learn, compact, and has an absolutely massive standard library. Candidates like it, too: even though we impose no language constraints, 90% of people I interview use Python. Also I use Python 3 because c’mon, it’s 2018.</p><p><em>Join <a href="https://discord.gg/cKFppJ">our Discord</a> to discuss this problem with the author and the community! </em></p><p>Imagine you place a knight chess piece on a phone dial pad. This chess piece moves in an uppercase “L” shape: two steps horizontally followed by one vertically, or one step horizontally then two vertically:</p><figure><img src="https://alexgolec.dev/content/images/2020/08/1-pE4b3hqGDv7pKivQTQZyPw.png" alt="Image for post"><figcaption>Pay no attention to the poorly-redacted star and pound keys</figcaption></figure><p>Suppose you dial keys on the keypad using only hops a knight can make. Every time the knight lands on a key, we dial that key and make another hop. The starting position counts as being dialed.</p><p>How many distinct numbers can you dial in N hops from a particular starting position?</p><p>Every interview I conduct basically breaks down into two parts: first we find an algorithmic solution and then the candidate implements it in code. I say “we” find a solution because I’m not a mute spectator: 45 minutes is not a lot of time to design and implement anything under the best circumstances, never mind under pressure. I let candidates take the lead in the discussion, generating ideas, solving instances of the problem, etc., but I’m more than happy to give a nudge in the right direction. The better the candidate, the fewer hints I tend to have to give, but I have yet to see a candidate who required no input from me at all.</p><p>I should underscore this, because it’s important: as an interviewer, I’m not in the business of sitting back and watching people fail. I want to write as much positive feedback as I can, and I try to give you opportunities to allow me to write good things about you. Hints are my way of saying “okay, I’m gonna give this bit to you, but only so you can move on and show me what you’ve got on the other parts of the question.”</p><p>With that being said, your first action after hearing the question should be stepping up to the whiteboard and solving small instances of the problem by hand. <em>Never dive right into code!</em> Solving small instances lets you spot patterns, observed and edge cases, and also helps crystallize a solution in your head. As an example, suppose you start on 6 and have two hops to make. Your sequences will be…</p><ul><li>6–1–8</li><li>6–1–6</li><li>6–7–2</li><li>6–7–6</li><li>6–0–4</li><li>6–0–6</li></ul><p>…for a total of six sequences. If you’re following along, try taking a pencil and paper and deriving these. This doesn’t translate well into a blog post, but trust me when I say there’s something magical about working out a problem by hand that leads to many more insights than just staring at it and thinking quietly.</p><p>With all that said, you may have a solution forming in your head. But before we get there…</p><p>One of the surprises I had when I started using this problem is how often candidates get stuck on computing the keys to which we can hop from a given position, also known as the neighbors. My advice is: when in doubt, write an empty placeholder and ask the interviewer if you can implement it later. This problem’s complexity does not lie in the neighbor computation; I’m paying attention to how well you count full numbers. Any time spent on neighbor computation is effectively wasted.</p><p>I would accept “let’s assume there’s a function that gives me the neighbors” along with the following stub. Of course, I’ll probably ask you to double back and implement this later, but only if we have time. You can simply write a stub like this and move on:</p><pre><code>def neighbors(position):
	...</code></pre><p>Also, you don’t really lose much by asking to use a stub: if the question’s complexity is elsewhere I’ll allow it. If not, I’ll ask you to actually implement it. I don’t mind when candidates don’t realize where the complexity of a question lies, especially in the early stages when they might not have fully explored the problem.</p><p>As for the neighbors function here, given that it never changes you can simply create a map and return the appropriate value:</p><pre><code>NEIGHBORS_MAP = {
    1: (6, 8),
    2: (7, 9),
    3: (4, 8),
    4: (3, 9, 0),
    5: tuple(),  # 5 has no neighbors
    6: (1, 7, 0),
    7: (2, 6),
    8: (1, 3),
    9: (2, 4),
    0: (4, 6),
}
def neighbors(position):
    return NEIGHBORS_MAP[position]</code></pre><p>Anyway, on to the solution. Perhaps you’ve already noticed this problem can be solved by enumerating all possible numbers and counting them. You can use recursion to generate these values:</p><pre><code>def yield_sequences(starting_position, num_hops, sequence=None):
    if sequence is None:
        sequence = [starting_position]
    
    if num_hops == 0:
        yield sequence
        return

    for neighbor in neighbors(starting_position):
        yield from yield_sequences(
            neighbor, num_hops - 1, sequence + [neighbor])

def count_sequences(starting_position, num_hops):
    num_sequences = 0
    for sequence in yield_sequences(starting_position, num_hops):
        num_sequences += 1
    return num_sequences</code></pre><p>This works, and it’s a common starting point I saw in interviews. Notice, however, that we generate the numbers and never actually use them. This problem asks for the <em>count</em> of numbers, not the numbers themselves. Once we count a number we never revisit it. As a general rule of thumb, I recommend paying attention to when your solution computes something it doesn’t use. Often you can cut it out and get a better solution. Let’s do that now.</p><p>How can we count phone numbers without generating them? It can be done, but not without an additional insight. Notice how the count of numbers that can be generated from a given starting position in N hops is equal to the sum of the counts of hops that can be generated starting from each of its neighbors in N-1 hops. Stated mathematically as a recurrence relation, it looks like this:</p><figure><img src="https://alexgolec.dev/content/images/2020/08/1-mcwSdrDe69X5FDegPmfgHg.png" alt="Image for post"></figure><p>This is intuitively obvious when you consider what happens with one hop: 6 has 3 neighbors (1, 7, and 0) and in zero hops you can reach one number for each, so you can only dial three numbers.</p><p>How does one arrive at this insight, you might ask? If you’ve studied recursion, this should become evident after some exploration on the whiteboard. Many candidates who’ve practiced recursion immediately notice this problem breaks down into smaller subproblems, which is a dead giveaway. If you’re in an interview with me and you can’t seem to arrive at this insight, I will usually give hints to help get you there, up to and including outright giving it away if prodding fails.</p><p>Once you have this insight in hand, you can already move forward and solve this problem again. There are a number of implementations that use this fact, but let’s start with the one I see most often in interviews: the naive recursive approach:</p><pre><code>from neighbors import neighbors                                 
                                                                
def count_sequences(start_position, num_hops):                  
    if num_hops == 0:                                           
        return 1                                                
                                                                
    num_sequences = 0                                           
    for position in neighbors(start_position):                  
        num_sequences += count_sequences(position, num_hops - 1)
    return num_sequences                                        
                                                                
if __name__ == '__main__':                                      
    print(count_sequences(6, 2))                                </code></pre><p>That’s it! Combine this with a function to compute the neighbors and you’ve produced a working solution! At this point, you should pat yourself on the back. If you scroll down you’ll notice we’ve still got a lot of ground to cover, but this point is a milestone. Producing any working solution already sets you apart from a surprising number of candidates.</p><p>This next question is one you’re going to be hearing a lot from me: what is the Big-O complexity of this solution? For those who don’t know, Big-O complexity is (informally) a sort of shorthand for the rate at which the amount of computation required by a solution grows as a function of the size of the input. For this problem, the size of the input is the number of hops. If you’re interested in the proper mathematical definition, you can read more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation" rel="noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p><p>For this implementation, every call to <code>count_sequences()</code> recursively calls <code>count_sequences()</code> at least twice, because each key has at least two neighbors. Since we recurse a number of times equal to the …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>This tutorial will walk you through the high-level process of rooting an Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K (3rd generation of Fire TV Stick, released in 2017).</p><p>Rooting the stick is possible thanks to an exploit uncovered by user <em>xyz</em> on the <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/fire-tv/orig-development/unlock-fire-tv-stick-4k-mantis-t3978459">XDA forums</a> and user <em>k4y0z</em> who created a nice package for executing the exploit. They called this package <a href="https://github.com/amonet-kamakiri/kamakiri"><em>kamakiri</em></a>.</p><h2 id="why-root">Why root</h2><p>Unlocking the Fire TV Stick with root access allows us to install anything we want on it and circumvent the limitations of the stock operating system. For example, here are some of the things that can be done with a rooted Fire TV Stick:</p><ul><li>Get the Google Play store installed</li><li>Install root applications</li><li>Mount external storage</li><li>Replace the launcher</li><li>Block Amazon auto-updates that remove features</li><li>Remove bloatware applications</li><li>Block ads on the homescreen and in applications</li><li>Control Fire TV Stick from a computer</li><li>Set up a SMB server</li><li>NTFS support</li><li>Overclock the CPU</li><li>Use bash automation scripts</li><li>and more!</li></ul><p>We’ll only be going over the rooting process and optionally installing Arch Linux on Termux towards the end of this post.</p><h2 id="what-well-need">What we’ll need</h2><p>We’ll need the following items for this tutorial:</p><ul><li>An Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K</li><li>A computer, preferably with Linux</li><li>A USB drive</li><li>A small flathead screwdriver</li><li>A piece of aluminum foil</li><li>An OTG cable</li></ul><p>We’re going to use Linux to burn a patched Linux kernel ISO into the USB drive which will be used to boot from and run the exploit on the Fire TV Stick.</p><p>We need to make a slight hardware change to unlock the bootloader on the Fire TV Stick. The flathead screwdriver will be used to open up the Fire TV Stick to get access to the small capacitors on the board that we need to short circuit to unlock the bootloader. We’ll be connecting the points with a small piece of aluminum foil.</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_On-The-Go">OTG cable</a> is for connecting external storage to the Fire TV Stick in order to expand it’s internal storage. The Fire TV Stick has only has 8GB of internal storage which less than 5GB are actually available for use. We install apps or move existing apps into the external storage to free up internal memory which should make the Fire TV Stick a bit more responsive.</p><h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2><p>The sequence of steps we’ll be taking are the following:</p><ol><li>Open Fire TV Stick case <a href="#open-fire-tv-stick-case">#</a></li><li>Remove Fire TV Stick heat shield <a href="#remove-fire-tv-stick-heat-shield">#</a></li><li>Short circuit to unlock bootloader <a href="#short-circuit-to-unlock-bootloader">#</a></li><li>Download patched kernel ISO <a href="#download-patched-kernel-iso">#</a></li><li>Burn ISO to USB drive <a href="#burn-iso-to-usb-drive">#</a></li><li>Boot USB Drive on computer <a href="#boot-usb-drive-on-computer">#</a></li><li>Flash TWRP recovery image <a href="#flash-twrp-recovery-image">#</a></li><li>Rooting with Magisk <a href="#rooting-with-magisk">#</a></li><li>Connect Fire TV Stick to TV <a href="#connect-fire-tv-stick-to-tv">#</a></li><li>Install Termux <a href="#install-termux">#</a></li><li>Install Arch Linux <a href="#install-arch-linux">#</a></li><li>Expand Fire TV Stick storage <a href="#expand-fire-tv-stick-storage">#</a></li></ol><p>It’s important to not that you should do this on stick that has been setup already with an amazon account, since I’ve read that it may not be possible to set it up correctly after it’s rooted.</p><p>Also make sure to enable USB debugging by going into the Fire TV Stick: <em>Settings</em> -&gt; <em>My Fire TV</em> -&gt; <em>Developer options</em> -&gt; turn <em>ON</em> for <em>ADB debugging</em> and turn <em>ON</em> for <em>Apps from Unknown Sources</em></p><h3 id="open-fire-tv-stick-case">Open Fire TV Stick case</h3><p>Opening the case is pretty simple; use a tool like a small flathead screwdriver or pry opening tool (like <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32965493649.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.ae5416601i6ysE&amp;algo_pvid=5f42c4cf-09e9-45f5-939b-2b774ea91ec6&amp;algo_expid=5f42c4cf-09e9-45f5-939b-2b774ea91ec6-8&amp;btsid=0bb0622a16000347004641252e1588&amp;ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_,searchweb201603_">this one</a>) and place it in between the crevice to open it.

      <div>
        <p>When I first started programming, especially when asked for code
samples, my comments lacked purpose and would often duplicate in
English what the code clearly indicated. I knew that "commenting is
good" but as a beginner I had no further insight.</p>
<p>Over time with the help of books like Clean Code, I grew disdainful of
comments. Good code should be self-documenting. Whenever I needed to
write a comment to explain something, I'd realize I could easily
rename some key variable or function. I grew more comfortable with
variables and functions with a few words in the title. Better to spend
time on good code structure and naming.</p>
<p>
  I have always left TODOs though, since TODOs can't so easily be
  expressed in variable names. But even these TODOs concerned me
  because they existed in my issue tracker, or maybe should have.
</p><p>As I watched mature open source projects and mature engineers, I came
to value well-documented pull requests. Solid pull requests include or
link to all necessary background, opportunities failed or ignored, how
to use, links to external bugs requiring workarounds and the results
of performance evaluation.</p>
<p>Beyond pull request descriptions, when I really wanted to grease a
pull request I'd use the pull request UI to add comments calling
reviewer attention to key changes in lines of the diff.</p>
<p>Both kinds of guidance are a massive aid to reviewers, saving a lot of
time.</p>
<p>But when I'd find a bug in code -- and I knew there was good pull
request documentation, even for pull requests as recent as six months
ago -- I've been repeatedly failed by the pull request and <em>pull
request comment</em> search exposed by Github and Gitlab.</p>
<p>I <em>knew</em> there were links to documented oddities or bug reports in
pull request threads. But practically speaking, for historic pull
requests, pull request comments are useless.</p>
<p>This is the single biggest reason I've started to push for more
comments in code. More so than all other tools (issue tracker, code
management system, etc.) comments in code have the greatest chance of
still being around and <em>easily searchable</em> if they haven't been
deleted.</p>
<p>
  Don't get me started on pull request documentation in an external
  medium like Slack. It's so rewarding to get or give instant feedback
  on changes on instant messengers, but good luck finding that
  discussion 3 months later.
</p><p>Every time I have to call out a line of code in a pull request, that's
immediate cause for that code to be modified with comments.</p>
<p>Maybe I wouldn't do this if Github/Gitlab exposed a Google Docs-like
interface for browsing code line by line with links to all pull
request comment threads.</p>
<p>Please reply on Twitter with questions or comments.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The biggest reason to add comments in code (often linking to documented oddities or bug reports) is because it's impossible to search pull request threads historically in every source control management UI I've used.<a href="https://t.co/JlHWfbUH5z">https://t.co/JlHWfbUH5z</a></p>— Phil Eaton (@phil_eaton) <a href="https://twitter.com/phil_eaton/status/1303130504993136642?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 8, 2020</a></blockquote>

  <h2>The Age of the Spiritual Machine</h2>
<h3>Boot Sequence</h3>
<p>A softly toned, analog alarm pierced the quiet of Harrison’s city apartment. His forgotten dreams slipped through the cracks as his consciousness took over to start the day. Just another day.</p>
<p>He sighed, rolling out of bed, and switched on his phone. The morning ritual’s feed sprung to life with a firehose of ads, notifications, software updates, and Twitter notifications – all masquerading with self-importance.</p>
<p>Harrison scrolled through, filtering for anything important, or messages from loved ones. Amid the stupid tweet recommendations and ancient newsletters he really ought to unsubscribe from, a Calendar notification caught his eye.” Meeting reminder: Lunch with Jacob @ 12pm”. He was looking forward to this.</p>
<hr>
<p>Stepping into the shower, he welcomed the hot water to wash away an average night’s sleep. Showers were his sanctuary, a private oasis to think, generate ideas, and relax without any distractions or Slack messages.</p>
<p>His mind booted up. He hadn’t seen anything in the mornings feed regarding his application for the Neuralink surgery. He grew anxious; it was just over a week since they said they would get back to him, and there was still radio-silence.</p>
<p>Feelings of jealousy arose with painful thoughts of his fellow programming colleague who’d recently received a Nueralink. Already, in the two weeks since he’d had the surgery, his co-worker had rebuilt the entire API service for his department, learned sales, marketing, and was now championing technical client relations. All with a new paycheck and high-praise from the CEO, of course.</p>
<p>Harrison was still stuck as a QA engineer, left to do the manual human testing of the AI’s complicated work. Despite the consistent late-night studying, algorithm practice, and competition submissions, he was only just managing to stay afloat at his job. 5 years ago, he had a high paying role as a senior engineer, but some things had changed in the past few years. It was hard to keep up.</p>
<p>A temporary blast of cold water shattered his stream of thought. He dried off in the kitchen and put on a brew of Golden Teacher mushroom tea. It had been 3 years since psychedelic psilocybin mushrooms had been approved for legal, personal use. Harrison brewed them daily. It was not enough to feel anything or create any hallucinations. The tea gave Harrison a necessary, though only slight, edge in the competition with the Connies. Others had also embraced the “natural augmentation” that psilocybin offered, eager for anything to expand the mind and stay relevant amongst the chaos. An increasingly common blend of techno-spirituality and psychonaut techniques permeated Harrison’s online social network.</p>
<p>Since the “Linked Revolution”, a “Connie” was a nick-name for those fortunate enough to afford and receive the Neuralink surgery. They were a different kind. The “Linked Revolution” took the world by storm. An increasing number of professionals, creatives, investors, business-people, and politicians itching to get the implant. They couldn’t build the installation machines fast enough.</p>
<p>The world underwent vast sweeping changes as the bandwidth between humans and machines exploded by several orders of magnitude. A bridge for humanity and AI to co-exist. Human 2.0.</p>
<p>Nothing was the same. Harrison sipped his tea.</p>
<hr>
<p>Harrison’s best friend was his ryukin goldfish, Alice. The pair had a simple relationship, and he liked it that way. Harrison would talk, and she would listen. She was good at that.</p>
<p>He stood there in his towel, staring into her large bowl, watching her circle aimlessly.</p>
<p>“Are we still relevant, you and I, Alice?”</p>
<p>She bubbled in response.</p>
<p>Harrison wondered if <em>normal</em> humans and goldfish had grown more alike over the past few years.</p>
<p>“Are we trapped to the confines of a watery sphere? At the mercy of a greater force, one that can expand beyond the physical constraints of our world? Is our entire existence defined by the chance that they forget to feed us one day?”</p>
<p>He chewed his lip and concluded the tea was kicking in.</p>
<p>“Good chat Alice.”</p>
<p>Harrison cleaned his mug, slipped on his freshly washed jeans, and put on a WWDC 2030 shirt from earlier this year. The years alone at a computer all day and night had not done wonders for his health, and the jeans were a bit too tight. He opened Tesla Fetch on his phone and ordered a ride to his usual cafe spot in the city.</p>
<p>Running downstairs, he bumped into his neighbor, an old-lady chatting away on FaceTime to her grandchildren in Bali.</p>
<p>“Oh, Harrison, dear! Say hello to my oldest grandchild, Namibia. She’s in Bali, you know?” the old-lady enthused.</p>
<p>“Bali? That’s a dangerous place to be,” Harrison squinted at the tiny screen she was thrusting in his face, “How are things down there?”</p>
<p>“We’re here to enjoy the last of it before it goes under,” Namibia sighed, “Doing what we can to help the locals, you know?” She seemed sad.</p>
<p>Harrison worked for a startup, Rising Tide, that provided AI relocation assistance for struggling islanders. The thought of being in Bali right now made him queasy.</p>
<p>“Ah, ok. Well, look after yourself!” and he darted down the remaining stairs into the tiny backstreet of his city. Strangers weren’t his strong suit.</p>
<hr>
<p>After a quick glance at Fetch, it told him the ride was still a few minutes away. Instead, he opened HackerNews and leaned against the wall as he consumed his most trusted source.</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft VR Office overtakes Oculus sales with new Neuralink integration</li>
<li>New nuclear fission plants to replace California’s solar farms</li>
<li>SABER virus gains a second wave in South East Asia</li>
<li>Ask HN: Best Linux distros for Neuralink/AI development?</li>
<li>Successful Second Landing of SpaceX Mars Mission</li>
</ul>
<p>The last one caught his eye. SpaceX had successfully established a Martian base in 2027, officially turning humans into an interplanetary species. Incredible efforts and resources were now being poured into the space industry. Transportation, energy innovation, various offshoots of spacecraft companies, asteroid mining expeditions, pirates fighting with the US Space Force; it was all very science-fiction and exciting.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for most, the experiences of this brave new world were limited to news articles and immersive video games. Space was reserved only for those who could afford it, or smart enough to work in it. The competition for a job in space was astronomical, and a non-Connie securing a position these days was almost unheard of. Harrison day-dreamed.</p>
<p>Not long after, the pleasant hum of the driverless, electric, Tesla Fetch zoomed into view, stopping with perfect deceleration right in front of Harrison. The doors swooshed open, and a gust of cool, conditioned air rushed to greet him as he stepped inside to sit on the comfy leather seat.</p>
<p>In the corner, a purple-haired tween was socializing loudly with her friends on some app.</p>
<p>“OMG, did you see her new TikTok video? I was like, ummmm, who are you trying to be, you know? Like, don’t pretend to do your own content when you’re just copying me. Be original, bitch. What? Oh yeah, I know. Yep. Mhm. She’s so fake. And it only got like 3 likes, so whatever. Mine got like, 300. Anyway, so what did you tell Ryan last night?”</p>
<p>There was another passenger, however, that intrigued Harrison much more. The strongly-built, middle-aged man was dressed only in black, sporting heavy boots, tinted sunglasses, and an expensive suit. His short brown hair was contrasted by his clenched, freshly-shaved jawline and tight lips. The air felt colder around him, and he seemed to exude a sense of danger and anger. He didn’t move a muscle as Harrison pulled out his phone, and the doors closed with a click.</p>
<p>“We’ll be ignoring him,” Harrison thought, uncomfortably resuming the perusal of today’s updates. The Fetch was speeding quickly through the city and took a slight turn, down into one of the city’s tunnel openings. The new underground system was AI-Designed, created by analyzing traffic patterns over the years. AI identified the most common routes and destinations people took, and humans drilled the tunnels. It was extremely efficient. Virtually nobody owned a car anymore, let alone drove – traffic was an issue of the past.</p>
<p>Harrison lamented on the hours he used to spend driving to the corporate office. All that wasted time, and for what? Since COVID, everything went remote, and the world had never looked back. SABER virus had only deepened the new workflow.</p>
<p>The Telsa slowed, stopping outside a mysterious, unmarked brick building. The agent (as Harrison supposed he must have been) promptly stepped out, without a sliver of expression, and entered the two reinforced steel doors of the building. Good riddance. Miss Tween was still happily gossiping away.</p>
<p>Harrion’s phone buzzed, notifying him he would arrive in a few minutes. 2 article headlines later, and they pulled up at The Electric Fig.</p>
<hr>
<h3>The Electric Fig</h3>
<p>The tiny, hipster cafe was wedged in an alley between two gigantic skyscrapers, barely seeing the sun. It opened up to the street with a giant floor to ceiling window, inviting busy passerby’s in with scents of fresh, 4th wave coffee and down-tempo jungle beats. Harrison stepped through the open door, waving at some of the staff, and tiptoed his way past potted plants and laptop chargers. His regular seat was at the very back.</p>
<p>As usual, the energy was palpable, with the tiny room stuffed full of other remoters, designers, devs, and bloggers. He was grateful for his noise-canceling headphones. A few other regulars he knew smiled at him from their conference calls.</p>
<p>Harrison made his way to the counter and was met with an unfamiliar, pretty face. He felt the butterflies in his stomach as he stumbled over his words.</p>
<p>“Hey, ugh, you new here?” Great. What a line idiot.</p>
<p>“Yeah I am,” she smiled, she had a happy voice, “Just started today”</p>
<p>Harrison glanced at her name tag, “Ugh, Khaleesi? Nice name”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” she sighed, and seemed annoyed he’d said anything, “My parents are …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-td-block-uid="tdi_70_afb"><div><p>We all know what we should be doing right now. But we don’t want to! That is procrastination in a nutshell.</p><p><em>Everything will be fine. I’ll finish it tomorrow. I still have plenty of time.</em></p><p><span>- Advertisement -</span> <ins data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1198872678846288" data-ad-slot="2989761355"></ins> </p><p>These are famous lines used by every procrastinator. And even though we do end up finishing things up just before the deadline, procrastination is not healthy for us in the longer run.</p><h2>Why do we procrastinate?</h2><p>Before getting into how to avoid procrastination, let us first think about the reasons behind it. Most of the time, we associate putting off things for tomorrow with being lazy. But there is more to the story than that. We use the facade of our laziness to justify and continue working on something trivial. We do it to get instant gratification.</p><h3>Enters… The Akrasia Effect</h3><p>“<em>Procrastination is such a classic problem that philosophers like Aristotle and Socrates coined a term to describe this behavior</em>” – <em>Akrasia</em></p><p>Wikipedia defines it as: “<em>Akrasia is described as a lack of self-control or the state of acting against one’s better judgment.</em>“</p><p>The critical piece here is the lack of self-control. It is this reason that we do not follow through on plans that we set out to achieve.</p><p>We make plans, set goals, and establish deadlines. And when the time comes to work on them, we start procrastination.</p><h3>Why do we make plans, but do not act on them?</h3><p>Procrastination is not a curse or a flaw in our character. It is a choice. We choose to do something else. Different than the work that we should have been doing.</p><p>The tendency of our mind to avoid working on essential tasks is explained by a psychological phenomenon known as time inconsistency. We tend to value immediate returns more than rewards that would come in the future.</p><p>When we are setting goals, we are doing it for our future self. We are visualizing long-term benefits for our future self when we are doing this goal setting. But when we have to start working on these goals, we detach ourselves to a different present self. And the present self is not excited about long term payoffs. It needs instant rewards.</p><p>Hence, our two selves: present self and our future self are at odds with one another. The consequences of not taking action today are delayed for the present self. And the delayed returns and long-term effects lead us into thinking that taking action right now is not necessary.</p><p>Tim Urban summarizes this phenomenon in a significant way in his TED Talk:</p><figure><p> <iframe title="Inside the mind of a master procrastinator | Tim Urban" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/arj7oStGLkU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure><h2>How can I beat procrastination?</h2><p>Okay, we now understand why our brain procrastinates. But what can we do about it? How do we force it into focusing on the moment and getting it to work now?</p><h3>1. Focus on building habits</h3><p>I have already covered this in my previous post about <a href="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/self-help/life-tips/3-simple-strategies-to-help-you-to-stick-to-your-goals/">building habits and systems instead of goals</a>. We do not have a willpower problem. Willpower is a limited resource, and we cannot solely rely on it every time. What we need instead is clarity. Having well-defined habits makes us more productive rather than waiting to get more motivated. Instead of trying to thinking “if I feel like doing it, then I would do it”, we should create plans for making it into a habit.</p><p>A paper published by a Duke University researcher found that more than 40 percent of the actions we perform every day were habitual. So, if we were to take the decision making out of our day to day activities, we would stop separating ourselves as the present self and the future self. Instead, we would emphasize the when, where, and how of the task, eventually implementing it as a habit.</p><h3> 2. Convert the habits into personal rituals</h3><p>The most challenging part of any task is the beginning. Getting started is what decides whether we will win the war or not.</p><p>There is a concept of activation energy in chemical reactions. And the activation energy for starting a reaction is the minimum energy required to start a reaction. This energy is directly proportional to the difficulty of the reaction. Once the activation energy is provided, the reaction continues to proceed to completion without any more energy.</p><p>Applying the same concepts to habits, we can make our physical environment be a driver to our routines. We should optimize for the starting line of the race since getting started is where the gold lies. Once we begin running, the race is often less painful.</p><p>We want things because they are an option. But, we can architect our lives so that we make good things easier for ourselves by changing our physical environments and realizing what triggers our behaviors. When building a newer habit, we want to focus on the habit of getting started with that habit. And that is where rituals come in, and creating triggers for the habit becomes essential.</p><p>If we want to read more, we can carry the book we want to read in our bag at all times to ensure ease of access. Or we can put it on the top of our pillow every morning. When we get back, we can pick it, and read a few pages before sleep.</p><p>We do not stick to positive habits consistently unless we shape our environment to assist us. There is only so much will power that we can muster every day.</p><h3>3. Enjoy the journey</h3><p>We only repeat our behaviors if we enjoy them. So we want to start small and create a habit first instead of trying to focus on milestones.</p><p><em>“Make it so easy you can’t say no.”—Leo Babauta</em></p><p>When starting out, we should emphasize on sticking to the habit. Also, we should avoid building multiple habits at the same time. Instead, try and build one habit a month to prevent burnout. Most of the time, we try to be a completely different person starting the next day. And that rarely works.</p><h3>4. Reward yourself</h3><p>We should also remember that good habits have a problem. There is no instant gratification. Since we know that already, we can design for it. Enjoying the experience along the way makes us more likely to stick to our habits. But we need to figure out ways to bring a reward in the present moment.</p><p>Rewards are a powerful reinforcer. And that is why we love some bad habits so much because of the immediate reward. So why not use them for our benefit?</p><p>The next time we finish reading a book, we could probably treat ourselves to chocolate 😉</p><p>Charles Duhigg, in his book “The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business” says:</p><blockquote><p>The research shows that every habit has three components. There’s the cue, which is a trigger for an automatic behavior to start. Then, a routine, which is the behavior itself. Finally, a reward. The reward is really important because that’s how your brain essentially learns to latch onto a particular pattern and make it automatic. Chocolate, after running, is an obvious example of a reward that many people enjoy. It doesn’t have to be chocolate. What matters is that if you want to make a behavior into a habit, you need to give yourself something you enjoy as soon as that behavior is done. It could be a piece of chocolate. It could be having a smoothie. It could be relaxing for 15 minutes and taking a nice shower. What’s important there is that people give themselves a reward.</p></blockquote><h2>Beware procrastination: We are ready to fight you!</h2><p>To summarize, things that we do once or twice fade away in the longer run. And the ones that we do consistently accumulate and compound into improving ourselves. And that is how we avoid procrastination from taking over.</p><p>We should not beat ourselves up if things don’t work immediately. Forgiving ourselves for the missed times is alright. As long as we keep investing energy into the habits, and keep making progress with time.</p><p>So let’s design our future actions, reduce the friction to getting started, enjoy the process, and reward ourselves on finishing the journey. What are you planning to stop procrastinating about, and start working on? Do let us know in the comments and let us begin improving ourselves together!</p></div></div></div>]]>

            <p>
                Posted on <time datetime="2020-09-18 13:43:00">September 18, 2020</time>
            </p>
                        <p>Most of the projects I work on have a <code>scripts</code> directory. For examples, here's are the scripts I use for <a href="https://allaboutberlin.com/">All About Berlin</a>:</p>

<pre>backup-db.sh
clear-static-cache.sh
copy-production-db.sh
restore-db.sh
save-composer-dependencies.sh
</pre>
<p>Those scripts are all very simple. They're under 10 lines long, and take no arguments. Some just call a single command, so why bother creating them?<br></p>
<p><em>What</em> must be done ("start the project", "run the tests" etc.) won't change. <em>How</em> it must be done ("yarn ...", "docker-compose ...") can change multiple time in a project's lifespan. <strong>It's a lot easier to update a single script than to propagate a new set of commands</strong>.</p><p>This script contains the only valid instructions for starting the project. <strong>It's the single source of truth for how to perform that task</strong>. Your colleagues, your CI/CD pipeline, your commit hooks, your cronjobs, your other scripts and your documentation can just refer to <code>start.sh</code>. If you change the script, the new instructions propagate instantly. You don't need to inform your colleagues, update a bunch of Jenkins jobs or update the README. All of it is still up to date. There will be no discrepancies.</p><p>With all those people and machines working off the same scripts, it pays to improve them. You can add usability improvements that will benefit the whole team. You can check the python/node/docker versions, add error handling, remove noise from the output, add colours and headers to build steps, and even interactivity.<br></p><p><strong>Script calls are also more explicit than commands</strong>. A Jenkins job that calls <code></code><code>lint-source.sh &amp;&amp; start.sh &amp;&amp; run-tests.sh &amp;&amp; ...</code> is pretty self-explanatory. A script called <code>create-user.sh</code> is easier to remember than <code>docker-compose exec backend python3 manage.py createsuperuser</code>. This is especially nice when you frequently switch between projects, and constantly need to recall how each one works.<br></p>

                    <p><em>This article is the third in a three part series that explores gold and Bitcoin in detail as products, including who the customers are for gold and Bitcoin, what jobs gold and Bitcoin do for them, and a perspective on the future markets for gold and Bitcoin.</em></p><h3 id="what-everybody-ought-to-know-about-gold-and-bitcoin"><strong>What everybody ought to know about gold and Bitcoin</strong></h3><ul><li><a href="https://andyjagoe.com/what-everybody-ought-to-know-about-gold-and-bitcoin-part-1-of-3-gold-as-a-product/">Part 1: Gold as a product</a></li><li><a href="https://andyjagoe.com/what-everybody-ought-to-know-about-gold-and-bitcoin-part-2-of-3-bitcoin-as-a-product/">Part 2: Bitcoin as a product</a></li><li>Part 3: The future for gold and Bitcoin <em>(this post)</em></li></ul><hr><p>On July 1, 1979, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkman">SONY released the Walkman</a>. Initial sales were disappointing, and the industry laughed at it because the sound quality was so poor compared to high-end speaker systems. But Walkman went on to be one of Sony's most successful brands of all time, selling almost 400 million portable music players. Walkman was never intended for the small number of people buying high-end speakers. Walkman enabled a much larger number of people to listen to music in places they never could have previously. In other words, Walkman's competition was never high-end speakers, it was non-consumption.</p><p>On January 9, 2007, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone">Steve Jobs announced the iPhone</a>. There was no app store at the time, and people forget how many <a href="https://bgr.com/2016/07/01/iphone-reviews-original-negative-ballmer-dvorak/">negative reviews it received</a>. Because it was such a poor actual phone, many early adopters actually carried an iPhone in addition to their regular cell phone. Steve Ballmer said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eywi0h_Y5_U">"There’s no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share</a>." So how did iPhone become Apple's most successful product ever, selling 2.2 billion units as of November 1, 2018, and extracting much of the profit from the wireless value chain that previously went to carriers? When iPhone launched, there were no smartphones that had web browsing and media consumption that people could actually use. The real competition for iPhone was non-consumption.</p><p>Uber was founded in 2009. When they were first raising money, many investors passed because they didn't think that the taxi market was big enough. But that was the wrong way to think about it. Uber's primary competition was not taxis, but non-consumption. And Uber ended up massively expanding the total market for rides.</p><p>What does all this have to do with gold and Bitcoin?</p><p>Similar to the products above, there have been no shortage of Bitcoin detractors since its launch on January 3, 2009. Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. It does not have alternative uses like jewelry or industrial applications. And gold has had thousands of years to entrench its position in the world. How could Bitcoin ever replace gold?</p><p>But what if this Bitcoin versus gold debate is a false dichotomy? </p><p>What if the "Bitcoin is digital gold" narrative is incomplete or misleading? What if thinking about Bitcoin in the context of gold is like thinking about Uber in the context of taxis?</p><p>Bitcoin enables a larger group of people than ever before to protect their savings and purchasing power. It does not do everything gold does. It doesn't need to.</p><p>Bitcoin's main competition is not gold. It is non-consumption. </p><p>Walkman, iPhone and Uber all seemed like toys when they were first launched. And though they may have been "inferior" products, that didn't matter because they were being sold to different customers. Over time, each product got better and better, and people began to trade down because the product was good enough and saved them money. In time, the new "inferior" products actually became better than the incumbents. And the incumbents shrank or disappeared.</p><p>But does this apply to Bitcoin? Is Bitcoin getting better? Isn't it the same now as when it launched in 2009?</p><p>Looking at the Bitcoin software project on Github we can see that it receives thousands of additions and deletions each week, and has received a steadily increasing number of contributions to master from 2010 to 2020.</p><figure><img src="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/09/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-1.png 600w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image-1.png 1000w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/image-1.png 1600w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/09/image-1.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Steady increase in Bitcoin commits to master (2010-2020)</figcaption></figure><p>Why is Bitcoin constantly being worked on and improved, even though it has no parent organization like Sony, Apple or Uber to push it forward?</p><p>Bitcoin works because it is a special kind of product. It's a multi-sided network.</p><p>Interaction between participants in the network creates incentives that drive the project forward. These network effects are why we see contributions to the Bitcoin project on Github growing at an increasing rate. </p><p>Let's map out the network flywheel¹ for Bitcoin and drop in the jobs to be done we identified in <a href="https://andyjagoe.com/what-everybody-ought-to-know-about-gold-and-bitcoin-part-2-of-3-bitcoin-as-a-product/">Part 2</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/09/Bitcoin-Network-Flywheel-Map-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/Bitcoin-Network-Flywheel-Map-2.png 600w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/09/Bitcoin-Network-Flywheel-Map-2.png 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Bitcoin Multi-Sided Network Flywheel</figcaption></figure><p>The multi-sided network for Bitcoin begins with Satoshi Nakamoto's vision for sound digital money and other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_bitcoin">early contributors</a> to the open source project and network. Once the network began to grow, specialized investors emerged to provide the financial capital necessary to develop the network. These investors typically hail from Silicon Valley or Wall Street, often co-invest on deals, and typically focus exclusively on cryptocurrency. Bitcoin mining operations developed, and these companies started building their own custom ASICs for mining, earning billions of dollars per year. Third party developers emerged to provide user-facing on-ramps and off-ramps to the Bitcoin network, as well as a wide range of infrastructure, analysis, trading and custodian services. Each layer of improvement to the network brought more users. Including more users, which itself brought more users.</p><p>The Bitcoin network exhibits increasing returns, which means that the more people who participate in the network, the more valuable the network is to every participant. This generates a natural monopoly and starts an exponential growth curve. </p><p>Gold is also a multi-sided network, but has weaker network effects.</p><figure><img src="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/09/Gold-Network-Flywheel-Map-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/Gold-Network-Flywheel-Map-1.png 600w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/09/Gold-Network-Flywheel-Map-1.png 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Gold Multi-Sided Network Flywheel</figcaption></figure><p>The multi-sided network of gold begins with the metal itself and the memes behind why gold has been obsessed over for thousands of years. We discussed this in detail in <a href="https://andyjagoe.com/what-everybody-ought-to-know-about-gold-and-bitcoin-part-1-of-3-gold-as-a-product/">Part 1</a> of the series.</p><p>From here we move to investors, who have been putting financial capital to work developing new technologies and applications for gold for millennia. Today, the gold value chain is very mature, and even the promise of AI in the exploration process seems likely only to yield incremental results. </p><p>Incentivized by the value of gold, miners perform the costly and time consuming process of locating gold deposits and producing doré, a metallic alloy containing between 60-90% gold. The steps in this process are <a href="https://www.gold.org/about-gold/gold-supply/how-gold-is-mined/exploration">exploration</a> (1-10 years), <a href="https://www.gold.org/about-gold/gold-supply/how-gold-is-mined/development">development</a> (1-5 years), <a href="https://www.gold.org/about-gold/gold-supply/how-gold-is-mined/operation">operation</a> (10-30 years), <a href="https://www.gold.org/about-gold/gold-supply/how-gold-is-mined/decommissioning">decommissioning</a> (1-5 years) and <a href="https://www.gold.org/about-gold/gold-supply/how-gold-is-mined/mine-reclamation">reclamation</a>. </p><p>The doré that gold miners produce is then the basis for a complex ecosystem of third parties that add value and create useful applications from gold. Refiners like Valcambi, PAMP, and Heraeus convert doré into semi-fabricated metals and alloys for use in the industrial and jewelry sectors and investment grade bullion and coins. Gold bullion is then accredited by the LBMA for <a href="http://www.lbma.org.uk/good-delivery-explained">good delivery</a> and then stored in vaults like the New York Federal Reserve and the Bank of England before being traded over the counter in London and Zurich or on exchanges like the London Mercantile Exchange. Gold futures are most often traded on COMEX in New York, and companies like State Street Global Advisors and Blackrock have built financial products like gold ETFs that have claims on gold bullion.</p><p>The products produced by this third party ecosystem are bought by consumers as jewelry, investors as bars/coins or financial products with claims to bars/coins, central banks and industrial users. For consumers, investors and central banks, gold is valuable because other people find it valuable. And the more people who find it valuable and will accept it in exchange for goods and services, the more valuable it is to all. This is the primary network effect in the gold network.</p><p>Bitcoin has a similar network effect. It too is valuable because other people find it to be valuable. And the more people who find it valuable and will accept it in exchange for goods and services, the more valuable it is to all. </p><p>But Bitcoin's network effect is different, because gold is physical and Bitcoin is digital. The software eats the world hypothesis says that any product or service in any field that can become software, will become software. We see these dynamics play out in industry after industry, and the field of hard money and wealth preservation is no exception. </p><p>Why is digital different? Digital products can take advantage of zero marginal costs and universality of compute, attributes that a non-digital substitute cannot compete with. Bitcoin is ten times better than gold on a few very important factors that dramatically improve its usability and accessibility compared gold for the average person. Bitcoin can be instantly transmitted anywhere in the world, it is easily and instantly divisible in a way that gold is not, it is trivial to carry (no matter the quantity), and it is hard to seize. </p><p>These benefits effectively expand the market for Bitcoin to a much larger number of network participants compared to gold. And Metcalfe's law projects that the value of a network is proportional to the square of its number of nodes.</p><p>And unlike gold, this is not where Bitcoin's network effects end. Because Bitcoin is software, it is steadily getting better, whereas gold remains unchanged. We have already shown above the increasing rate at which contributions are being made by Bitcoin network participants to Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin has the advantage of Moore's law with respect to compute and storage cost, and because trust is built into the network itself, third party developers typically open source all their code so there is a same-side network effect among third party developers who borrow each other's code and best practices. This adds an incredible accelerant to the Bitcoin network and stands in contrast to gold's well developed but opaque and closed third party ecosystem.</p><p>That said, Bitcoin still has a long way to go relative to other …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

September 22, 2020 | https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/international-sting-against-dark-web-vendors-leads-to-179-arrests | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/international-sting-against-dark-web-vendors-leads-to-179-arrests">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, a coalition of law enforcement agencies across the world announced the results of a coordinated operation known as DisrupTor which targeted vendors and buyers of illicit goods on the dark web.</p>
<p>This operation follows the takedown in May of last year of <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/double-blow-to-dark-web-marketplaces">Wall Street Market</a>, the world’s then second largest illegal online market in the dark web. Led by the German Federal Criminal Police (Bundeskriminalamt) with the support of the Dutch National Police (Politie) Europol, <a href="http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/" target="_blank">Eurojust</a> and various US government agencies, this takedown provided investigators with quantitative data and materials to identify suspects behind dark web accounts used for illegal activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, 179 vendors who engaged in tens of thousands of sales of illicit good were arrested across Europe and the United States. Over $6.5 million were seized in both cash and virtual currencies, alongside some 500 kilograms of drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, hydrocodone, methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine, ecstasy, MDMA, and medicine containing addictive substances; and 64 firearms.</p>
<p>The arrests were carried out in the United States (121), Germany (42), the Netherlands (8), United Kingdom (4), Austria (3), and Sweden (1). A number of investigations are still ongoing to identify the individuals behind dark web accounts.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT TO TACKLE THE DARK WEB</h2>
<p>Operation DisrupTor was composed of a series of separate but complementary joint operations coordinated by Europol and Eurojust, all aimed at making a global impact on the sale of illicit goods on the dark web.</p>
<p>This operation was the result of a collaborative effort between the law enforcement and judicial authorities of Austria, Cyprus, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commenting on this operation, the Head of <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/about-europol/european-cybercrime-centre-ec3">Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3)</a>, <strong>Edvardas Šileris</strong>, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Law enforcement is most effective when working together, and today’s announcement sends a strong message to criminals selling or buying illicit goods on the dark web: the hidden internet is no longer hidden, and your anonymous activity is not anonymous. Law enforcement is committed to tracking down criminals, no matter where they operate – be it on the streets or behind a computer screen.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>THE DARK WEB IS NO FAIRY TALE&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The golden age of dark web marketplace is over. Operations such as these highlight the capability of law enforcement to counter encryption and anonymity of dark web market places. Police no longer only takes down such illegal marketplaces – they also chase down the criminals buying and selling illegal goods through such sites.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="512" src="https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/images/editor/unnamed_0.jpg" width="1024"></p>
<h3>Thinking of buying illegal goods anonymously on the dark web?</h3>
<p>
These are the dangers you are exposed to:</p>
<ul><li>Putting your life in danger: dangerous illegal drugs such as fentanyl or counterfeit substances could kill you.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Become a victim of cyber scammers who are only after your money.</li>
<li>Exposing your device to damaging malware.</li>
</ul><p>Law enforcement can also trace back illicit transactions to both the buyer and seller. An individual who purchased illicit goods from hidden sites is at risk of prosecution in a number of countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dark web is not a fairy tale - vendors and buyers are no longer hidden in the shadow. &nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p>The following authorities took part in this operation:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Austria:</strong> Federal Investigation Bureau (Bundeskriminalamt)</li>
<li><strong>Cyprus: </strong>Cyprus Police (Αστυνομία Κύπρου)</li>
<li><strong>Germany: </strong>Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt), State Criminal Police Offices (Landeskriminalämter), the competent local police forces and Customs Investigation Offices (Zollfahndungsämter)</li>
<li><strong>The Netherlands:</strong> National Police (Politie), Royal Netherlands Marechaussee (Koninklijke Marechaussee)&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Sweden: </strong>National Police (Polisen)</li>
<li><strong>Australia:</strong> Western Australia Police Force, Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission</li>
<li><strong>Canada: </strong>Royal Canadian Mounted Police</li>
<li><strong>United Kingdom:</strong> National Crime Agency; Dark Web Intelligence, Collection and Exploitation (DICE)</li>
<li><strong>United States: </strong>Department of Justice (DOJ), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Immigration and Customs Enforcement – Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), US Postal Inspection Service (USPIS), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN),&nbsp;Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) and Department of Defense (DOD)</li>

<p><span>We recently set out to discover </span><a href="https://fairshake.com/consumer-guides/mapped-the-most-hated-internet-service-providers-in-every-u-s-state/"><span>which ISP was the most-hated in every U.S. state</span></a><span>, and in doing so, we learned more about the types of complaints many people have about their ISPs: billing problems, deceptive pricing, misleading sales tactics, poor service, slow speeds, and more.</span></p>
<p><span>We also got a glimpse of how many people have struggled with these types of problems —&nbsp;our research led us to thousands and thousands of one-star reviews left for ISPs online. It made us start to wonder: Just how widespread </span><i><span>are</span></i><span> these problems? How many people have disputes against their ISP, how many of those disputes go unresolved, and what avenues do consumers pursue to find help?</span></p>
<p><span>And so, we surveyed consumers, and the results were eye-opening. From our survey, we found that it’s possible that more than 20 million American households have unresolved complaints against their ISPs, and that while many of them look to legal action for help, most ultimately don’t end up moving forward —&nbsp;because the process is too expensive, it’s too complicated, or they just don’t know how.</span></p>
<p><span>Our survey results paint a picture of a country where consumers are almost held hostage by their ISPs — many of them experience serious problems, but when they do, they struggle to find avenues to resolution. Here’s everything we found.</span></p>
<h2><span>More Than 1/3 of Households Had a Dispute Against Their ISP in the Last Year</span></h2>

<p><span>That’s more than one-third of respondents. And when you extrapolate that finding to the 110.57 million U.S. households that </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/183614/us-households-with-broadband-internet-access-since-2009/#:~:text=This%20timeline%20shows%20the%20number,to%2080%20million%20in%202009."><span>had fixed broadband access in 2018</span></a><span>, that’s more than 40 million households with a complaint against their ISP in </span><i><span>just one year</span></i><span> — 40,446,500 of them, to be exact.</span></p>
<h3><span>More Than Half of Those Disputes Went Unresolved</span></h3>

More than half of them —&nbsp;50 percent —&nbsp;answered no when asked if the issue was “resolved to their satisfaction.”</span></p>
<p><span>Extrapolate </span><i><span>that</span></i><span> result to all the internet-connected households in the U.S., and this survey finding indicates that as many as 20,371,000 — more than 20 million — U.S. households had an unresolved complaint against their ISP in the last year alone.</span></p>
<p><span>That’s a shocking number, so we wanted more details. We wanted to know how people consider fighting against unfair charges and other complaints, so we dug a little deeper. Here’s what we found.</span></p>
<h3><span>Many People Consider Legal Action, but Most Don’t</span></h3>

<p><span>But we were shocked to learn that most people just don’t consider taking legal action against their ISP in the event of an unresolved issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Of our survey respondents who said they had unresolved complaints, 65 percent said they didn’t feel the need to pursue legal action — including a lawsuit, a small claims court case, a class action suit, or arbitration —&nbsp;or monetary compensation. Only just over a third, 35 percent, said they did consider legal action.</span></p>
<h3><span>Most People Who Do Consider Legal Action Don’t Go Through With It</span></h3>
<p><span>But most people with complaints against their ISP don’t even reach that point. Of the respondents in our survey who considered legal action:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>67 percent decided not to move forward with legal action</span></li>
<li><span>21 percent attempted to pursue legal action but were unsuccessful</span></li>
<li><span>13 percent were successful in pursuing legal action against their ISP</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>With so many people looking into legal action and then deciding not to pursue it, we wanted to know what made them stop.

<ul>
<li><span>31 percent of respondents said they stopped pursuing legal action when they found the process to be too expensive.</span></li>
<li><span>31 percent stopped because they simply weren’t sure how to proceed.</span></li>
<li><span>22 percent of respondents said they wanted to pursue legal action, but the process was too complicated.</span></li>
<li><span>16 percent of respondents said they needed help pursuing legal action, but couldn’t find the help they needed.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>That last statistic really stood out for us. More than 16 percent of people were wronged by their ISP and wanted help getting justice, but they couldn’t find the help they needed. That help is out there —&nbsp;or, right here.</span></p>
<h2><span>FairShake Is the Best Way to Get the Justice Your Deserve</span></h2>
<p><span>Getting the justice you deserve against ISPs —&nbsp;and all kinds of other companies —&nbsp;doesn’t have to be long, drawn out, complicated, or expensive. And most importantly, you don’t have to do it alone.</span></p>
<p><span>At </span><a href="https://fairshake.com/"><span>FairShake</span></a><span>, we help consumers avoid expensive and time-consuming court cases, and instead help them pursue arbitration, a process similar to mediation that employs a professional, neutral third party to help reach resolution in a dispute. You just tell us about your complaint, and we’ll create an official legal demand on your behalf. Then, we’ll help guide you through the next legal steps so you’re never left alone or in the dark.</span></p>

<h2><span>Methodology</span></h2>
<p><span>We surveyed 1,200 American consumers over the age of 18 using PollFish.com between June 15-16, 2020. We asked six total questions about whether they’d had a dispute with their ISP in the last year, whether it was ever resolved, and what they did to try to get justice.</span></p>
<p><span>11 percent of respondents were ages 18 to 24. 17 percent were ages 25 to 34. 22 percent were ages 35 to 44. 19 percent were ages 45 to 54, and 32 percent were 55 and up.</span></p>
<p><span>58 percent identified as female, and 42 percent identified as male.</span></p>
<p><span>To get a bigger-picture view of the scope of some of our survey results, we extrapolated out sample size to the population of the entire U.S., and the number of U.S. households that have fixed broadband home internet access. Our sample size allowed us to apply results to a group the size of the U.S. population with 95 percent confidence and a 5 percent margin of error.</span></p>

Kafka Connect provides scalable and reliable way to move the data in and out of Kafka. As it uses plugins for specific plugins for connectors and it is run by only configuration (without writing code) it is an easy integration point. </p><p>Visit the <a href="https://turkogluc.com/apache-kafka-connect-introduction/">Kafka Connect Basics</a> post if you would like to get an introduction. </p><h3 id="1-running-kafka-cluster">1- Running Kafka Cluster</h3><p>We can use the following docker-compose file to get Kafka cluster with a single broker up and running.</p><pre><code>version: '2'

While we start Kafka Connector we can specify a plugin path that will be used to access the plugin libraries. For example <code>plugin.path=/usr/local/share/kafka/plugins</code>. Check <a href="https://docs.confluent.io/current/connect/managing/install.html#connect-install-connectors">Install Connector Manually</a> documentation for details. </p><p>We also need JDBC 4.0 driver as it will be used by the connector to communicate with the database. &nbsp;<code>Postgresql</code> and <code>sqlite</code> drivers are already shipped with JDBC connector plugin. If you like to connect to another database system add the driver to the same folder with <code>kafka-connect-jdbc</code> jar file. See <a href="https://docs.confluent.io/current/connect/kafka-connect-jdbc/index.html#installing-jdbc-drivers">Installing JDBC Driver</a> Manual.</p><figure><img src="https://turkogluc.com/content/images/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-21-at-19.32.36.png"></figure><h3 id="3-running-kafka-connect">3- Running Kafka Connect</h3><p>We can run the Kafka Connect with <code>connect-distributed.sh</code> script that is located inside the kafka <code>bin</code> directory. We need to provide a properties file while running this script for configuring the worker properties.</p><pre><code>connect-distributed.sh &lt;worker properties file&gt;</code></pre><p>We can create create <code>connect-distributed.properties</code> file to specify the worker properties as follows:</p><pre><code># A list of host/port pairs to use for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster.

However we include or exclude the list of tables in copying by <code>table.whitelist</code> and <code>table.blacklist</code> configurations.

Incremental modes can be used to load the data only if there is a change. Certain columns are used to detect if there is a change in the table or row.</p><p><code><strong>bulk</strong></code>: In this mode connector will load <strong>all</strong> the selected tables <strong>in each iteration</strong>. If the iteration interval is set to some small number (5 seconds default) it wont make much sense to load all the data as there will be duplicate data. It can be useful if a periodical backup, or dumping the entire database.</p><p><strong><code>incrementing</code></strong>: This mode uses a <strong>single column</strong> that is <strong>unique</strong> for each row, ideally auto incremented primary keys to detect the changes in the table. If new row with new ID is added it will be copied to Kafka. However this mode lacks the capability of catching <strong>update</strong> operation on the row as it will not change the ID. <code>incrementing.column.name</code> is used to configure the column name.</p><p><strong><code>timestamp</code></strong>: Uses a single column that shows <strong>the last modification timestamp</strong> and in each iteration queries only for rows that have been modified since that time. As timestamp is not unique field, it can miss some updates which have the same timestamp. <code>timestamp.column.name</code> is used to configure the column name.</p><p><code><strong>timestamp+incrementing</strong></code>: Most robust and accurate mode that uses both a unique incrementing ID and timestamp. Only drawback is that it is needed to add modification timestamp column on legacy tables.</p><p><strong><code>query</code></strong>: The connector supports …</p></div></div>

		    			<h3>Each year in October, <br>Women Make is holding a 30-Day Challenge.</h3>

		    			<p>The concept is simple: <strong>30 days to build and launch something</strong>. Can be anything. It doesn't have to be a tech product. Can be with code or without code. The only requirement is to work on a project during these 30 days.</p>

		    			<p>Last year, participants made websites, ebooks, apps, podcasts, newsletters, events, eshops, blogs, etc. You can have a look at finished projects <a href="https://womenmake.com/challenge-2019-result">here</a>.</p>

		    			<p>All ideas are welcome! You can build an app from A to Z. You can decide that you will reach a certain number of subscribers on your newsletter. You can add a feature to an existing product. You can finally get back to that side-project. It's really up to you. <strong>You get to define your own goal.</strong></p>

		    			<p>The only rule is to ship it on October 31st.</p>

		    			

		    			<h4>The 30-Day Challenge is not a competition.</h4>

		    			<p>The particularity of this hackathon is that it’s <strong>not competitive</strong>. The goal is to work together, side by side, getting help from the community. There are no winners and we support each other the whole time.</p>

		    			<p>During the challenge, you are strongly encouraged to <strong>build in public</strong> and <strong>take advantage of the community</strong>. We have a private Telegram group, as well as the <a href="https://womenmake.com/">forum</a>, to communicate. On both, you can find support, ask for advice, get feedback, run polls, share your progress, and help others.</p>

		    			<h4>Why should I participate?</h4>

		    			<p>We all are busy and have things we keep postponing. This challenge is actually the <strong>perfect opportunity to get things done!</strong> Here are a few reasons why this is a great idea to participate: </p>

		    			<ul>
		    				<li>Work on a new product</li>
		    				<li>Boost your spirit</li>
		    				<li>Get to know other members of the community</li>
		    				<li>Do something you wouldn't normally do</li>
		    				<li>Take some time to start a project you have in mind since some time</li>
		    				<li>Get things done</li>
		    				<li>Build something surrounded by amazing people</li>
		    				<li>Show the world women build great things</li>
		    			</ul>

		    			<p>We could go on. The thing is, if you read until here, it probably means you should do it. ;)</p>


		    			<h4>So, what's the plan?</h4>

		    			<p><strong>The 30-day challenge starts on October 1st and ends on October 31st.</strong> Don't worry! Depending on your availability, you can start a few days later. It's not a problem. It's okay if you don't know what to work on yet. We can actually help you with that: ask on our private Telegram chat or on the <a href="https://womenmake.com/">forum</a>. Just jump in and we will figure it out together!</p>

						<p>If you have any questions, or if you are feeling hesitant, just <a href="https://womenmake.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#214c4053484461564e4c444f4c404a440f424e4c">drop an email</a>! 😊</p>

						<p>The only thing you need to do now is to <strong>register</strong> and you're in in a minute! We are so excited to welcome you as a new participant to the challenge! 😍</p>

						<p>So, are you in? We're waiting for you!</p>

            <p><a href="https://riggraz.dev/">..</a></p>
<p>Sometimes programming can be frustrating. In the last few years I’ve noticed a recurrent pattern that drives me mad. I like to call it <em>Stack Overflow Antipattern</em>.</p>

<p>In this <del>informal blog post</del> rigorous medical paper I’ll explain the symptoms, possible causes and treatment for this horrible <del>antipattern</del> disease.</p>

<hr data-content="symptoms">

<p>My definition of the Stack Overflow Antipattern is the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Spending more time looking for a solution rather than thinking about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For me, it goes like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I encounter a problem I can’t immediately solve</li>
  <li>I google the problem</li>
  <li>I find a seemingly-satisfying solution (usually on Stack Overflow)</li>
  <li>I copy-paste the solution and test it out</li>
  <li>If it works, I move on; otherwise, I go back to step 2.</li>
</ol>

<p>During the whole process I’m completely focused on looking for a solution, I’m <em>rushing</em> towards the solution. As time goes on, if I can’t find what I’m looking for, my frustration grows and I find myself skimming faster and faster through the results: I’m not thinking, I’m just looking for the damn solution.</p>

<hr data-content="a clinical case">

<p><img src="https://riggraz.dev/assets/images/comics/001-stack-overflow-antipattern.png" alt="Comic#001: The Stack Overflow Antipattern"></p>

<hr data-content="causes">

<p>I think there are several causes that can lead to the Stack Overflow Antipattern.</p>

<p>The root cause is a lack of thinking. Obviously, not understanding the problem and the possible solutions results in a trial-and-error approach, which is exactly what the antipattern is about. But, at least personally, why don’t I take the time to think?</p>

<p>Firstly, I know that the answer to my problem is probably somewhere on the web. We’re all used to being spoon-fed by Stack Overflow. We’re all used to having immediate access to tons of valuable information over the internet, so why not search there before overworking one’s grey matter?</p>

<p>Another reason is that a programmer has to face lots of problems, sometimes not necessarily directly related to software development. Even though the problem at hand and its solution(s) should, ideally, be properly understood, there may be several reasons why one chooses not to do so, i.e. being in a hurry, pure and simple ineptitude, exhaustion, laziness etc.</p>

<p>Whatever the reason, we therefore decide, more or less consciously, not to think.</p>

<hr data-content="treatment">

<p>So, ultimately, the Stack Overflow Antipattern is all about a lack of reasoning. What then is the best (and free!) treatment for a compulsive refusal to think? Well, more thinking.</p>

<p>In particular, I believe there are three broadly-defined phases in which one should pause and ponder:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Before the search. The problem should be crystal clear in order to write the right query that will help find the solution. Bad search queries (or, even worse, queries about the <em>wrong</em> problem) rarely lead to satisfying answers.</li>
  <li>During the search. The solution found should be at least clear enough to be sure it can solve the problem at hand (possibly without causing other problems!).</li>
  <li>After the solution proved to work. This is the time to pause again and synthesize problem and solution together. Everything should be clear enough to remember it afterwards (or at least remember how to find the solution again), in order to solve the problem faster if it occurs again. This will save time in the long run.</li>
</ol>

<p>The list above is by no means a strict rule, but a general guideline I came up with while writing the article. The heart of the matter is that one should think a lot before and after searching the web.</p>

<hr data-content="conclusions">

<p>Before closing up, I must emphasize two points.</p>

<p>First, I’m not saying that Stack Overflow or similar resources <em>shouldn’t</em> be used. The point is that they shouldn’t be used <em>mindlessly</em>.</p>

<p>Second, it’s inevitable that sometimes, for a number of reasons, the Stack Overflow Antipattern will occur. Depending on the scenario, it could also be the best choice. For example, if a project is running late and timely delivery is essential, there could be no time to stop to think why a certain solution works. And that’s okay. The important thing is to find a balance that takes into consideration both external factors (e.g. deadlines) and internal ones (e.g. one’s desire to learn), and to consciously fall into the antipattern.</p>

<p>In the end, I think that the point of this article is pretty trivial. Everybody knows that thinking is an essential part of solving a problem, even if the answer is already available somewhere.</p>

<p>However, I also believe that many programmers are victims of the Stack Overflow Antipattern. At least I am, from time to time, but more than I’d like to.</p>

<p>Trivia: I had the idea of this post nearly one year ago and is the number one reason that made me open this blog. It should’ve been the first article, but, just as I started writing it, I got the inspiration for the <a href="https://riggraz.dev/code-and-memory.html">code and memory post</a>. Since the latter was simpler and shorter, I decided to write it first.</p>

<p>I also want to mention that the comic strip was a last-minute idea. And, given my drawing skills, it was probably a bad idea.</p>

<p> Posted by Paulo on September 21, 2020</p>
<p>It’s been a long time since the last update. That certainly wasn’t intended, but I didn’t expect a pandemic. Anyway, the wait is over and I believe it was worth it! Version 3.4.0 of Secrets for iOS is now available on the App Store, and with it a major new feature.</p>
<h2 id="remote-access">Remote Access</h2>
<p>With this update you can now use Secrets on your iOS device as a remote keychain for filling Logins <b>and</b> Credit Cards on a browser running on another machine, such as on Windows or Linux.</p>
<p>Secrets is, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, only available on Apple platforms. That’s where our expertise and our heart is. Having said that, we do have many requests for other platforms. While Secrets itself won’t run on Windows anytime soon, this feature is the next best thing.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h3>
<p>With the updated browser extensions for <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/secretsapp/" target="_blank">Firefox</a> and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secrets/nljhipdleaglbopomanmebenmiibbkmg" target="_blank">Chrome</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> you can now pair one or more iOS devices to serve as a remote keychain. The pairing works by simply reading a QR Code from the extensions’s options page.</p>
<p>Then, when you get to a page with a login or payment form, you just click the Secrets toolbar icon on your browser and a request is sent to your paired devices via push notifications.</p>
<p>On your device, you tap the notification to open Secrets and select the login you want to use. That information is sent back to browser to and the form is automatically filled. And of course this is all <a href="https://outercorner.com/secrets/security/#remote_access">end-to-end encrypted</a>.</p>

<p>The 3 steps to auto fill your secrets on a remote machine</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We think this will be huge for many of Secrets’s users. Many of them only use Apple devices personally but have a Windows machine at work.</p>
<h3 id="the-secrets-command-line-tool">The <code>secrets</code> command line tool</h3>
<p>The browser extensions will suffice for many of our users but we didn’t stop there. We’re also releasing an open source command line tool so you can integrate Secrets in many of your workflows.</p>
<p>With this tool you can retrieve not just Logins, but any type of data that you have stored in Secrets. Including specifying which item properties you want. Here’s an example command:</p>
<pre><code>$ secrets request github -u https://github.com -t login:otp -d "Paulo's iPhone"
</code></pre>
<p>We think sysadmins will love this! This tool is on <a href="https://github.com/outercorner/secrets-remote" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and you can install it via <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@outercorner/secrets-remote" target="_blank">NPM</a>.</p>
<p>As always, we love to hear from you, so let us know what you think via <a href="https://outercorner.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3e4d5b5d4c5b4a4d7e514b4a5b4c5d514c505b4c105d5153" target="_blank">e-mail</a> or on <a href="https://twitter.com/outercorner" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>

<p><h2>The Holy Trinity of Wireguard, hosts and PiHole</h2></p> 
<em>17-09-2020</em> 
<p><em>side note - you can now get my blog posts direct to your email. Simply sign-up to the mailing list <a href="https://computer.us17.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=5f4f7d396d677d02863499e75&amp;id=950eb046d2">here</a></em></p>
<p>Since the pandemic of 2020 started, I've been working remotely up in Scotland, away from my A.I. box down in London. Even before COVID-19 struck, I've often been working remotely, attached to some network I don't know or trust. In such cases, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network">Virtual Private Network (VPN)</a> is absolutely necessary. Not only that but given the appalling state of the internet at the moment, I need a little bit of extra protection. I'd like to talk about three tools I've started using that have really improved things for me over the last few months: <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">wireguard</a>, <a href="https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts">hosts</a> and <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pihole</a>.</p>
<h3>Wireguard</h3>
<p>In the past, I used <a href="https://openvpn.net/">Openvpn</a> all the time. I had my own virtual server out on the internet, a couple of machines in my home and my roving laptop. I found keeping the certificates organised a real pain. The speed wasn't great and having to do an awkward split of port 443 traffic was no fun either. When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6">ipv6</a> entered the mix, OpenVPN became almost unusable, at least for me.</p>
<p>Most people hear about VPNs through adverts and sponsors who talk about privacy, getting around region blocks and protecting your data. But really, a VPN is about connecting certain computers together into a private network, over the top of some existing network. It just so happens that one of your computers on this network can act as a gateway to the wider world. This is the setup I have with Wireguard. </p>
<p>Just before the lockdown started in London, I figured I needed to get remote access to my AI box sorted before I left for Scotland. I spent several frantic hours trying to get OpenVPN to work but to no avail. In the end, I abandoned it and switched to <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">Wireguard</a>.</p>
<p>I couldn't be happier!</p>
<p>Wireguard is so much simpler and elegant! Straight off the bat it worked with only a few minor hiccups. Once I'd ironed these out, I had a reliable connection I could use, despite lacking a static IP address on the AI Box. Oh yes, I forgot to mention - my decent internet connection had failed. With lockdown looming, an engineer wasn't going to be arriving anytime soon. I had to settle for a 4G router and hope for the best! Thankfully Wireguard is pretty quick. It claims to be one of, if not the fastest, VPN solutions out there. Since I've been using it for the past 6 months, I've not noticed any significant lag.</p>
<p>Setting up wireguard is quite straight-forward if you are doing peer-to-peer. Their website has a little video and a guide telling you how it's done. The first thing to note is that there is no concept of a server and client, <em>per-se</em>. Rather the server box is peered with all the peers on your network whereas each client only peers with one peer acting as the server.</p>
<p>The server setup might look something like this:</p>
 <pre><code>[Interface]
Address = 10.9.9.1/24
Address = &lt;PUBLIC IP&gt;/22
SaveConfig = true
PostUp = iptables -A FORWARD -i %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
PostDown = iptables -D FORWARD -i %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
ListenPort = 443
PrivateKey = &lt;PRIVATE KEY&gt;

[Peer]
PublicKey = &lt;PUBLIC KEY&gt;
PresharedKey = &lt;PRESHARED KEY&gt;
AllowedIPs = 10.9.9.2/32
Endpoint = &lt;FILLED IN BY WG&gt;

[Peer]
PublicKey = &lt;PUBLIC KEY&gt;
PresharedKey = &lt;PRESHARED KEY&gt;
AllowedIPs = 10.9.9.3/32
Endpoint = &lt;FILLED IN BY WG&gt;
</code></pre> 
<p>Each client's config also looks somewhat similar:</p>
 <pre><code>[Interface]
PrivateKey = &lt;PRIVATE KEY&gt;
Address = 10.9.9.2/24
DNS = 10.9.9.1

[Peer]
PublicKey = &lt;PUBLIC KEY&gt;
PresharedKey = &lt;PRESHARED KEY&gt;
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
Endpoint = &lt;SERVER IP&gt;:443
</code></pre> 
<p>I use port 443 as it's rarely blocked. This does mean the server can't really run a https server but that's fine for now. </p>
<p>One thing I haven't quite figured out is how the routing works in depth. Quite often, local LAN traffic is also sent over wireguard too, which isn't very efficient at all. I'm still working that out but I believe it's something to do with the <em>AllowedIPs</em> setting.</p>
<p>The utility <em>wg-quick</em> will setup the service when given a configuration file. It's also a service on systemd based distributions.</p>
<p>One important issue reared it's ugly head when I was setting up redundancy. Once my internet had been repaired, I began setting up a second backup internet gateway; if the primary connection failed, the second would take over. This seemed fine, until I realised the wireguard tunnels wouldn't reconnect. For whatever reason, no matter which settings I used, wireguard would not reconnect to the server if the gateway changed. In the end, I wrote a watch-dog script that I placed in my root user crontab, running every minute:</p>
 <pre><code>#!/bin/bash
handshake=`/usr/bin/wg show wg0 latest-handshakes`
tokens=($handshake)
ctime=`date +%s`
diff=$((ctime-${tokens[1]}))
echo $diff
if (( $diff &gt; 180 )); then
systemctl restart wg-quick@wg0.service
fi
</code></pre> 
<p>This script checks how long it has been since the last handshake. If it's over 3 minutes then it restarts the service. This worked reasonably well, though there is of course, a small amount of downtime if the connection fails over to the backup. Better than nothing at least. Hopefully, someone else will come up with a better idea in the future.</p>
<h3>PiHole</h3>
<p><a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pihole</a> is a set of programs, bundled together in a nice installer that sets up an alternative DNS server, blocking trackers, advertisers, and other undesirables. It acts as a sinkhole for such things, detecting DNS requests for these <em>ne'er-do-wells</em> and sending them into the void. It's designed to run on a RaspberryPi, hence the name, but it can run on pretty much anything.</p>
<p>I thought I'd give this a try on my local network. Installing on a Pi is really easy, and I was up and running in minutes. The problem was, once I'd plugged it all in, the wifi in our flat really took a drop in performance! I'm still not sure why. It could be the power-supply to the Pi, or the Pi itself; both were in close proximity to the router.</p>
<p>I thought again, and decided I'd run PiHole on the wireguard machine. That way, any machine that connects to the wireguard VPN could also use that machine for it's DNS. This seemed like quite an elegant solution. I added the following line to each peer:</p>
 <pre><code>DNS = 10.9.9.1
</code></pre> 
<p>Boom! That easy! Except it's not really. Most of my Linux machines have a bit of trouble setting the DNS correctly when they connect to a network. Typically, the DNS gets set to whatever the local network says it should be set to, despite the wireguard interface being up. Particularly with my laptop - when it wakes from sleep or connects to a new network - has a tendency to reset the DNS to whatever the default is. One method I've found looks like this:</p>
 <pre><code>sudo apt-get install resolvconf
sudo gedit /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base
</code></pre> 
<p>In this file you can alter the defaults and it <em>should</em> work. I've not had it work for me however. There is another method involving <em>dhcpcd</em>:</p>
 <pre><code>sudo vim /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf
prepend domain-name-servers 10.9.9.1;
</code></pre> 
<p>You'll find that second line commented out with a hash-sign. Delete the hash and hopefully, the changes to resolv.conf should stick.</p>
<figure><img src="https://shutr.benjamin.computer/inpost/pihole.png" alt="PiHole statistics"><figcaption>The main offenders in my PiHole setup.</figcaption></figure>

<p>PiHole has a web interface that allows you to see which of your machines are connecting and what has been blocked. In my case it seems that 
 <em>smarteucookiebanner.upsell-apps.com.herokudns.com</em> is the worst offender. Glad to see it being blocked at least!</p>
<h3>hosts</h3>
<p>A chap called Steven Black, over on github, has made a repository called <a href="https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts">hosts</a>. This program collects hostnames and the associated ip addresses from various published lists, collating them into your /etc/hosts file. These entries are redirected to 0.0.0.0, effectively blocking them. </p>
<p>I've found hosts to be really useful when used with cron. During the day, I have been distracted by things like twitter and I've wanted to block social media sites generally, while I'm working. This program groups sites into categories such as social media, spyware, advertising etc, and lets you choose which ones you want to block. You can setup something like this:</p>
 <pre><code>0 10 * * * python3 /home/you/hosts/updateHostsFile.py -a -r -w /home/you/hosts/whitelist.txt -e social fakenews gambling &amp;&amp; service network-manager restart  
0 17 * * * python3 /home/you/hosts/updateHostsFile.py -a -r -w /home/you/hosts/whitelist.txt -e fakenews gambling &amp;&amp; service network-manager restart
</code></pre> 
<p>This works on ubuntu like distributions, but the manual has guides for other operating systems. I quite like the fakenews option. I feel like we could all do with a little less misinformation in our lives these days.</p>
<h3>Have things changed?</h3>
<p>I've noticed that my productivity has gone up a little, but more than anything else, I just feel a little more chipper. Keeping off social media, not having as many adverts thrown at me, and the knowledge that I'm a little harder to track and market at has made me feel just a little bit happier. Given current events I'll take whatever little victories I can. I'd highly recommend these tools.</p>

September 22, 2020 | https://firehydrant.io/blog/build-your-api-first/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://firehydrant.io/blog/build-your-api-first/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have a beef with companies that don’t expose nearly everything their product can do with an API. I get anxious wondering, “why can I only do some of the things via the API? How is this sausage made?” Sure, there are plenty of examples of endpoints that shouldn’t be exposed, such as changing passwords probably should be kept private. Regardless, there are tons of examples of products that I can type in a field in the UI, but that field isn’t available in the API. I can perform an operation like archiving, but doing it with a simple HTTP request with an Authorization header? Forget it.</p><p>This isn’t an attack on inadequate (or non-existent) APIs, but rather why choosing to go API first from Day 1 will be a game changer for your business, and the decisions we made at FireHydrant to do this. </p><h2>The Frontend Matters</h2><p>Users expect a dynamic experience on the frontend now. This expectation likely comes from their experience with Facebook, Netflix, and other large tech firms with the resources to invest in complex frontend architectures. It’s a sad reality, but if your website just doesn’t have a particular type of fancy sizzle to it, customers may think it’s “cheap.”</p><p>Dynamic frontend experiences provide a sense of quality. It’s the same feeling you get when you hear an excellent <em>thud</em> <a href="https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/car-door-sound-engineering">when closing a car door</a>. Serving plain old HTML with no automatic updating in the UI just doesn’t cut it anymore.</p><p>This is a hurdle for young companies, many with little or no funding, vying for people’s attention. You want to move fast and create. But adding layers of React, Redux, GraphQL, a complicated backend… it hurts to even think about doing it when you have no customers.</p><p>It’s a tough choice for companies just starting out with their software offering. Do you go full frontend / API, or do you go as fast as possible, and add the API later? </p><p>(Hint: Most add the API later.)</p><h2>How we designed a company with an API first mentality</h2><p>When we raised our Seed funding, we had no idea what the future <em>really</em> had in store for us. Every start-up operates under constant uncertainty, and we’re no different. My co-founder and our Head of Product, Dylan, slept on my couch for 6 months to get through this time. But a choice we made early on has compounded in interest, and I don’t think we’d do it a different way ever again:</p><p>We decided to build a JSON API, a React+Redux frontend, with Swagger 2.0 documentation, for <em>everything.</em></p><p>We’re using Ruby on Rails for our core application, so in a way, much of this wasn’t actually tough to do. We use <a href="https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape">Grape</a> for our JSON API and React, Redux, for our frontend. When we build something new, it gets a new API. When we need to toggle the state on an object, it gets a new endpoint. New object type? New JSON entity descriptor. </p><p>This discipline has amassed a substantially extensive JSON API for a company that is just over a year old, with 131 endpoints as of writing. All of our runbooks, severities, service catalog, and even the status page subscription endpoints have an associated API.</p><h2>The benefits of going API first</h2><p>We’re not stapling an API to a tree and hoping it behaves the same way as our UI. Our validations will be the same, pubsub events occur the same way, even security checks stay the same. I’ve been at multiple companies that haven’t done this, and I’ve never seen it end well. The inconsistencies that your customers will face when you build an API years after the main app will madden them the point where they tweet at you, constantly asking, “why? why did I deserve this?”</p><p>We’re trying our hardest to avoid this entirely. We’ve even built the API with the concept of bot tokens, as well. This means actions can be performed against the FireHydrant API without a user. If a user leaves your organization (they will), your API integrations shouldn’t break with it. Everyone has seen the dreaded “{Insert integration name} has been removed from this channel” in Slack when someone leaves the company.</p><p>Mobile applications are in the playing cards for us, too. And because our APIs are built and then consumed by our frontend engineers, it’s a good litmus test before we ever give it to a customer. Best of all, customers can integrate with us and expect the same level of care our UI gets.</p><p><em>Let me repeat that.</em></p><p>Customers can integrate with us and expect the same level of care our UI gets.</p><p>Because we build our UI on top of the same APIs, that means users get a greater sense of stability. Our APIs aren’t an after-thought; they <strong>are</strong> the thought.</p><h2>Greenfield is kind of cheating</h2><p>I’m not ignorant to the fact that we had a leg up: we could <strong>start</strong> the company this way. Most folks reading this will not have that advantage. But the benefit of shifting mindset to an API first mentality will compound in interest as your company moves on. FireHydrant can build and deploy features faster than anyone else in our space because of these types of decisions.</p><p>The fact is, we knew this adventure was a risk from the beginning, but we operated under the assumption that we were on to something. When we started to get out of the trough of despair that all startups see before growth, we were prepared with a well-built API that we consumed ourselves, and therefore anyone could. We made a bet that we weren’t dying anytime soon, so let’s do it the right way now.</p><p>If you have the confidence to build an API at all, you owe it to yourself and your customers to build it first. You should be able to tell your customers (jokingly) “If you hate our design, our API has everything you need to make your own interface.” Also, from a business perspective, if you’re not investing in an incredible programmable interface to your product, you’re losing out on millions (yes, millions of dollars) in long term revenue. Customers that integrate with you are now more than customers, they’re partners.</p><p>Build the API, and then build the rest of the feature on that API. It has long term gains, customers can integrate more effectively, and best of all, you don’t have 2 branches of logic to maintain.</p></div></div>]]>

                    <p>So you're a technical founder looking for practical advice on how to market the product you just built?</p><p>You're thinking about hiring someone or outsourcing your marketing entirely because "you're not an expert"?</p><p>If you're going that route should you hire a freelancer or an agency? And how do you determine if they're doing a good job?</p><h2 id="why-you-should-market-your-product-yourself">Why you should market your product yourself</h2><p>Sure, you could outsource this part of your business because it's time consuming, tedious and a bit of a "black art" (especially for technical founders).</p><p>But marketing doesn't have to be this fuzzy part of your business which is more often than not neglected due to confusion around "Funnels", "Growth Hacking" and "Channels".</p><p>Marketing is about connecting with your audience and it's a big competitive advantage if you're the person in charge of such connections. With marketing you can keep an ear to the ground, gathering data as to what does and what doesn't resonate with your audience. You can then use this data to inform your product and marketing decisions and attract more potential customers via "free" channels such as SEO / Search, Social Media or Word-of-Mouth.</p><h2 id="but-where-do-you-start">But where do you start?</h2><p>Getting the whole marketing machinery up- and running can indeed be an intimidating endeavor. But it doesn't have to be! The key is to pick a marketing channel that will likely resonate with your audience and build from there.</p><p>I'd suggest that you start with Content Marketing in the form of <strong>solution oriented blog posts</strong>. "Why?" you might ask. The reason is simple yet powerful.</p><p>Your potential customers are already looking online for solutions to their problems. They use search engines to find answers to specific questions they're currently dealing with. If your software helps with those problems, wouldn't it be nice if users find your product and give it a try?</p><p>While this sounds compelling it's easier said than done. The main issue is in figuring out what kind of content resonates with your users and more importantly what content attracts users who are on the lookout to buy a solution to solve their problem at hand. Just crunching out blog post after blog post in the hope of hitting the jackpot won't do the trick. Plus it takes a whole lot of time and effort to write the content in the first place.</p><p>So how do you come up with content ideas that your future customers are interested in? I got some great news for you: <strong>You already have all the data that's necessary to write such content</strong>. You just have to take a couple of minutes to dig it up!</p><h2 id="turning-support-requests-into-blog-posts">Turning support requests into blog posts</h2><p>Chances are that you have a lot of historical chat data in your customer support system, whether that's a fully-fledged CRM system like Intercom or your E-Mail inbox. You might've realized that for some topics you got the same questions over and over again. The usual reaction to this phenomenon is to create a dedicated FAQ entry which answers the question and point the next customer who's asking about this specific question to the direction of the FAQ. Another, complementary solution is the Knowledge Base which usually goes into more detail as to what the problem and its potential solutions are.</p><p>Why don't you go a step further and turn your FAQ / Knowledge Base entries into dedicated blog posts? With very little extra effort you can use your support requests as a way to inform and kick-start your Content Marketing strategy.</p><h2 id="example-blog-post-structure">Example blog post structure</h2><p>How could such a support request repurposing look like? Here's an example blog post structure you might want to use or adapt according to your needs to get started today.</p><p><strong>Headline</strong><br>The support question. E.g. "How do I &lt;Problem&gt; with &lt;Your Product&gt;?".</p><p><strong>Problem Description</strong><br>Write a paragraph or two to describe the problem your customer is experiencing.</p><p><strong>Feature Description</strong><br>Write a couple of paragraphs about your products feature which helps in solving the previously stated problem. Take some time to go into more detail here and outline the value your product provides.</p><p><strong>How to solve the problem</strong><br>Provide an exact step-by-step guide which shows how a user will solve the problem with your product. Include screenshots if necessary.</p><p>Add a way to create a permalink which points to this headline. This makes it easier for you to share the exact location where you describe the fix in your blog post. This way users with the link will get straight to the solution rather than having to scroll through the whole article.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>Wrap things up and plug the values your product provides a second time.</p><p><strong>CTA</strong><br>Provide a call to action with a "Next Step" the user might want to take. This could be a Newsletter signup box or a link to another feature your product provides (another support request informed blog post).</p><h2 id="the-benefits-of-this-approach">The benefits of this approach</h2><p>Are you still on the fence if it's worthwhile to go down this route? The following is a list with some of the benefits you'll experience when you implement this strategy:</p><ol><li>You leverage your support request queue to "generate content ideas" for you</li><li>Once written you can easily share the blog post with customers who request support for the exact same problem</li><li>Chances are that the user in question shares the article with co-workers / her network in the future (because it's a blog post rather than a FAQ entry)</li><li>If you're interlinking all your blog posts, customers will educate themselves and get more value out of your product</li><li>You're highlighting the features your product offers and show how such features help users solve their problems</li><li>You'll automatically be indexed by search engines (SEO)</li><li>People who will search for phrases such as "How do I ..." will discover your posts and immediately see the benefits they'll get when they use your product</li><li>You'll save time because you write the content once rather than writing a FAQ entry, update the Knowledge Base, add a section to the User Manual, etc.</li></ol><h2 id="your-challenge">Your challenge</h2><p>I'd like to challenge you to take 30 minutes today to look through your support queue. Just scroll through all the requests and try to identify patterns. What problems are most of your users struggling with? Is there an overarching theme?</p><p>Write down the main pain points and turn them into dedicated blog post headlines. Next up, use the structure above (or a variation of it) to write the outline of your blog posts.</p><p>Dedicated 30 minutes each day to work on such posts. You'll be surprised how effortless this gets with every single day you work through your list! Don't throw in the towel if you're making little progress the first few day(s). That's normal. Keep the momentum going and you'll have created a lot of valuable content you can share on your business blog in the next couple of weeks.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>It's tough to come up with great blog post ideas your users are likely to enjoy, let alone to start the whole marketing machinery as a non-marketing focused founder. An easy way to deal with such issues is to look into your support system and identify patterns. Are there any questions which have been asked multiple times? Are there some features your customers have more questions about compared to others?</p><p>Rather than jumping into the creation of a FAQ entry and calling it a day think about a way how you can turn the question at hand into a dedicated blog post. Talk about the feature your user had a question about. Describe how it works and in which way it serves your customers. Showcase how easy it is to use that feature to accomplish a certain task with your product (the actual answer to the support question).</p><p>Doing so will save you time as you'll write an article once and for all rather than juggling different mediums like FAQs, Knowledge Bases, Documentation, User Manuals, etc. and it kick-starts your marketing efforts in a bite-sized way. Your business blog will be indexed by search engines and future customers searching for solutions to their problems will discover your article and see how your product helps them solve their issues.</p><p>I hope that you enjoyed this article and I'd love to invite you to subscribe to my Newsletter if you're interested in more, action-oriented posts like this.</p><p>Do you have any questions, feedback or comments?

<p>I’ve been at my current company for 7 years, and I’m a raving fan of it. But when a decent looking job opportunity comes my way, I apply. Whenever I can interview for something interesting, I do it.</p>



<p>Why? A few reasons:</p>



<ul><li>The only way to know if my company pays me fairly is by comparing to offers I get from other companies. Without that, how would I know my worth to the market?</li><li>Low stakes interviews are good experience. Whenever I do eventually need a new job, I’ll be better at interviewing and less stressed about it.</li><li>Interviews are efficient at pointing out my weak points. If I stumble on questions about roadmapping or testing automation or whatever, then I know that I should beef up those skills.</li><li>A job offer is proof that I’m not trapped in my job. If I turn it down, I’m staying because I want to, not because I have to. The opportunity to leave makes staying more fulfilling.</li><li>Interviewing are fun when my livelihood isn’t on the line. I get to talk about the stuff I love with someone who is <em>asking</em> to hear about it. How often do you get that in everyday life?</li><li>Someday I may get the killer offer that I can’t turn down, and if I don’t interview then I’ll never know.</li></ul>



<p>Am I wasting the interviewer’s time, when I have no plans to quit? No, I always tell them that I’m happy at my current company. If they still want to interview me, they know that I would need a killer offer at the end to make the leap. So far, no one has said “never mind” after hearing that, but they have an out if they want it.</p>



<p>Do you interview when you don’t need a job? Why or why not? <a href="https://twitter.com/mcrittenden">Tweet me and let me know</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>One of the weird things that people don’t tell you about management is the degree to which people will sometimes scrutinize your behavior.</p>

<p>This is completely opposite to how most human interactions work. Generally speaking people overestimate how much attention others are paying to them. It’s easy to be embarrassed if your voice cracks while meeting someone new, if you say something silly in front of your in-laws, or if you have spaghetti sauce on your shirt. In most cases nobody notices because their own life is being pumped into their brain in stereo.</p>

<p>But this isn’t always true. People actually <em>do</em> scrutinize the behavior of people who have some measure of control over their careers (such as the CEO) carefully, and in some cases will even document what they say for a rainy day. This pattern becomes more extreme as titles and organizations grow, to the point where the job of a Fortune 500 CEO almost overlaps with Broadway theater.</p>

<p>The reasons for this are obvious. People aren’t paying attention out of any sort of expectation of wisdom – but when someone has an impact on your job, it’s rational and reasonable to analyze them to help your career. However, I find that few new managers are aware of this phenomenon, which can have far-ranging consequences.</p>

<h2 id="the-awkward-lunch">The Awkward Lunch</h2>

<p>I remember the first time that I learned this lesson. I was eating lunch with my team as we lightly discussed our upcoming customer conference, and made a quick, dismissive offhand comment about how I felt that one of our marketing teams, led by Steve, was going in circles and wasting time on trivial details. This was 100% wrong – you should never “otherize” other teams – but I didn’t say anything particularly incendiary or critical. Nobody made any mention and I certainly forgot what I had said almost immediately.</p>

<p>Two weeks later, a member of my team offered out of the blue to handle an upcoming planning meeting with Steve’s group. I was confused – why was she making this offer? “Well, you mentioned that you thought that Steve had a tendency to waste time, and I know that you’re presenting at that conference in a week so you’re probably busy. I figured I could help cover a meeting with a team you don’t like.”</p>

<p>A team I don’t like? Where did that come from?! I dimly recalled the lunch in which I had made that comment, and realized that the offhand comment which I had immediately deleted from my mind had stuck with my lunchmates. With a growing sense of dread, I also realized that versions of this situation had probably been happening without my realizing it.</p>

<h2 id="managing-under-a-microscope">Managing Under a Microscope</h2>

<p>Advice that I had received earlier in my career, especially after becoming a new manager: assume that someone might remember everything you say or do. For extra fun, also expect that about 10% of the juiciest details that get remembered will be at least somewhat inaccurate.</p>

<p>Since it can be jarring to realize that your team is watching you a little bit more closely than you might like, I try to convey the general advice below to first time managers on my team:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Treat everything that you say like an email – assume that it may live on in someone’s memory for a long time after you say it.</li>
  <li>Be intentional in how you operate or communicate, as some people (particularly your team) may emulate some of your patterns. If you are really harsh when you communicate with other teams, they’ll tend to be harsher as well. If you’re extremely accommodating, they’ll also tend to be more accommodating.</li>
  <li>Build the mental muscle of being less reactive to stressful situations. Try not to visibly frown or look skeptical unless you really mean to express that emotion as people will likely pick up on it. This is true even if you’re stressed because you’re thinking about how your corgi Mr. Snuffles is sick, and your bad mood has nothing to do with work.</li>
  <li>Be extra vigilant not to say things that could be misconstrued as disrespectful or offensive.</li>
  <li>Don’t get wasted at your company’s holiday party, or at other types of events. While I find that most people will give you a pass, it’s really easy to start rumors after hours.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no way to stop people from scrutinizing – it’s human nature mixed with rational behavior. But if you’re intentional in your actions, you should at least be able to avoid putting your foot in your mouth by saying something dumb at lunch.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>Possibly my finest contribution to the infosec industry is introducing the concept of #yolosec, first discussed when I introduced decision trees as a threat modelling device in my Black Hat talk back in 2017<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Not one to let a solid shitpost go to waste<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, I want to expand and expound on that concept, and introduce its ideological opposite: #fomosec. Most security efforts are hilariously inefficient, but only one end of the spectrum (#yolosec) is typically called out. That changes today.</p>
<p>This post will explore why both YOLO security (YOLOsec) and FOMO security (FOMOsec) are pernicious disservices to infosec defense and how you can spot them so that you may yeet them from your organization’s security strategy.</p>
<p>The tl;dr is that #yolosec and #fomosec are disconnected from the goals and needs of the business, forsaking pragmatism and prudence in favor of fanatical flavors of recklessness. YOLOsec reflects a security strategy driven by a “you only live once” mentality – one that emboldens people to ignore future concerns around security to achieve today’s gratification. FOMOsec reflects a security strategy driven by a fear of missing out – one that frightens people into misallocating resources towards what makes them <em>feel</em> better about their security efforts.</p>
<p>If you imagine your organization as a sea-faring vessel, infosec’s goal is to ensure the boat can survive krakens or canon-wielding pirates and successfully complete its journey. If you ignore the existence of sea terrors (#yolosec), you may not make it to your destination unless Poseidon grants you merciful passage. If you prioritize defense above your vessel’s mission (#fomosec), you will find yourself aboard a battleship that is entirely inadequate for transporting revenue-generating cargo.</p>

<h2 id="first-does-security-matter">First, does security matter?</h2>
<p>Before we dig into defining #yolosec and #fomosec, I want to establish the appropriate context for these concepts. The potential peril inherent in these two “strategic” approaches rests on understanding security’s relevance to private-sector organizations<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. The not-so-dirty and not-so-secret dirty secret is that information security does not matter nearly as much as the infosec industry proselytizes. In the grand scheme of business risks, it is solidly in the bottom half, if not the bottom quartile<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Your organization is far more concerned with attracting and retaining customers, successfully competing in an evolving market, macroeconomic factors relevant to their industry (especially right now, amid the COVID-19 slowdown), operational interruptions and downtime, commodity price fluctuations, failure to maintain brand image and public perception, inadequate financial forecasting, changes in product mix impacting profitability, maintaining relationships with supply chain partners, impacts of seasonality, their litigation and regulatory risk profile, changes in international trade relations, climate change impacts, exchange and interest rate fluctuations, inability to access external financing, ability to anticipate consumer preferences, and, well, you hopefully get the idea by now<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>As far as tech stuff goes, organizations are primarily concerned about the interruption or inadequacy of IT systems, since those systems power ongoing business operations and, to varying degrees, fuel their revenue growth. To the ops readers among you, congrats, you are critical to modern business operations across most industries! To my infosec readers, I am certainly not saying you are unimportant, but, rather, that it is vital to be self-aware of one’s influence on the reality around you<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p>With that said, infosec is not completely useless<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. Attackers can absolutely cause operational interruption and downtime, most obviously through things like DDoS attacks, ransomware, or overloading cloud compute to eke out computercoins. Beyond those examples, security incidents in general necessitate recovery and response efforts which require money, time, and, frequently, system downtime (so money, money, and frequently money). There is limited evidence that security incidents lead to damaged public perception<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> or public market valuation<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Therefore, one can consider infosec important to organizations insofar that it either: 1) minimizes negative operational impact engendered by attacker actions 2) enhances qualities that improve business operations, such as the speed, stability, or scale of IT systems. To be clear, there is scant evidence of infosec achieving this second axiom in any meaningful fashion. Security teams encouraging the adoption of standardized APIs or base images is perhaps the only strongly justifiable example. Nevertheless, it remains an equally important, albeit contemporarily theoretical, justification for infosec’s relevancy to businesses.</p>
<p>Now we can explore #yolosec and #fomosec and why their manifestations are so magnificently monstrous.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-yolosec">What is YOLOsec?</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YOLO_(aphorism)">YOLO</a> is an acronym for “You Only Live Once,” the modern <em>carpe diem</em> and mostly ironic millennial catchphrase meant to express the unbridled living of life to its fullest in the present, believing the current moment to be vital and unique<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>, with scant regard to the future. YOLO-driven actions tend to manifest as risk-seeking activities, such as skydiving or, in the case of Napoleon Bonaparte’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Days">Hundred Days</a>, sneaking into France during exile, ripping your coat open and daring your former troops to shoot you, marching on Paris with said troops, reclaiming your title as emperor, engaging in a war against Europe’s major powers, losing at Waterloo, and returning to exile.</p>
<p>YOLOsec, and my irony-flavored hashtag #yolosec, is a term meant to describe a security strategy that embodies the “you only live once” mentality. A yolosec strategy says, “Setting our S3 bucket full of customer data to public will let us deploy our service faster, what could go wrong?” YOLOsec whispers sweet deceits in your ear, telling you that basic security countermeasures like privilege separation and access control are <em>tomorrow</em> problems – knowing full well that tomorrow will distend into months or years. And this temptation can metastasize across your systems and organization.</p>
<p>#yolosec is rarely instigated by a refutation of security’s importance; its wellspring is often found in an arguably myopic attention on specific business goals that are more easily or quickly achieved by ignoring or dismissing security considerations<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. True to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor">Hanlon’s razor</a>, #yolosec is almost assuredly due to incompetence rather than malice.</p>
<p>For instance, developers are not specifically aiming to write code so riddled with bugs that swamps are jealous, nor are they storing API keys in plaintext as an expression of their love for hackers – although both constitute #yolosec. Or, in organizations with high turnover, fresh engineering teams may barely understand how a legacy system works, rendering the exercise of upgrading or migrating it from its current insecure conditions clearly intimidating <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>.</p>
<p>It is thus understandable, albeit undesirable, that the default state of engineering teams is to overlook or neglect infosec concerns when performing their work. This is rarely due to succumbence to temptation, but simply the dearth of pragmatic security wisdom among engineering teams<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-fomosec">What is FOMOsec?</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out">FOMO</a> is an acronym for “Fear of Missing Out,” the modern <em>“keeping up with the Joneses”</em> meant to express the anxiety and regret borne from not participating in experiences in which others are involved – usually examined in the context of witnessing those experiences via social media. FOMO revolves around the basic human desire to understand what is going on, especially the impulse to stay connected with other humans’ experiences<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>.</p>
<p>FOMO can represent a sensation that others are living life better than you are, that you are outside of a social loop, that you are behind in life relative to others, or that everything is beautiful and nothing hurts<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> for everyone but you. Human brains are wired to judge outcomes relative to a perceived status quo<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> and to feel bad when experiencing a perceived loss<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>, so FOMO quite unfortunately presents a “buy one cognitive bias, get one free” deal. In a nutshell, there are two primary dimensions driving FOMO: a desire for belonging<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> and anxiety about isolation<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>.</p>
<p>FOMOsec, and the corresponding hashtag #fomosec, is a term meant to describe a security strategy that is driven by a fear of missing out and its psychological underpinnings<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. A #fomosec strategy says, “If you aren’t perfectly protecting literally all the things, what are you even doing?” FOMOsec cackles in your face, mocking your impotent control over the security of your organization’s systems and the flaccidity of your defense relative to the potency of your adversaries and the adulations showered upon your I.T. peers in engineering and operations.</p>
<p>Prioritization and pragmatism fade into the background under FOMOsec; what gains the spotlight is escaping the <em>feeling</em> of inadequacy – regaining a sense of autonomy and control irrespective of outcomes. Under #fomosec, you cry happy tears as your teeth clench and your knuckles whiten from the domspace ecstasy of gripping the wheel, euphorically ignoring that the wheel is not attached to anything and that your supposed steering is relegating you to stagnation.</p>
<p>Defenders, from security engineers to CISOs, are not deliberately sabotaging and impeding organizational operations because of a hatred for business growth or improvement. Every human longs to belong<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>. Defenders are not immune to this basic human need nor immune to its capacity to desecrate strategic thinking<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The human desire for approval and acceptance from groups who share their social identity is what most foments FOMO – seeking inclusion is even more powerful than avoiding …</p></div></div>

    <p>This article is a heads-up for the upcoming change in the naming of Dotty artefacts (as published to Maven). Currently, the organization name is “ch.epfl.lamp” which will become “org.scala-lang”. The artefact names will be changed from “dotty-xxx” to “scala3-xxx”.</p>
<p>This change will be part of the next Dotty release planned for October 1st which will be known as Scala 3.0.0-M1. We encourage maintainers of tooling (IDEs, build tools, ...) to prepare for this change now by special-casing the way they handle the compiler when its version number starts with <code>3.</code> just like they already had to special-case versions starting with <code>0.</code> to support existing Dotty releases.</p>

<h2><strong>Getting promoted to dev team lead</strong></h2>



<p>I was 24 years old. A baby.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three years into my software engineering career and loving it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Life was great. I lived in a small apartment in Southie (Boston) with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinh-quang-van-ha-b7023a10/" target="_blank">my college roommate “Q”</a>. I had a good job at a tech start-up called CloudLock. I hammered out code 12-14 hours a day. I worked so much I never knew what day it was and my bosses had to force me to go home. When I wasn’t working, I was playing <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornhole" target="_blank">bags (aka cornhole)</a> with my friends, lighting people up in Super Smash Bros Melee, or sleeping. Not a care in the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then a freight train hit me.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><picture>

</figure>



<p>My boss, our VP of Engineering <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-zeldich-b788a8/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael Zeldich</a>, pulled me aside one day. He explained our team was growing fast and it was getting tough for him to have 15+ engineers reporting to him directly. We needed to put some team leads in place so we could scale our org and make sure everyone was getting enough attention.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Would I be interested?&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/head_explosion_V2-1024x482.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/head_explosion_V2-1024x482.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/head_explosion_V2-300x141.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/head_explosion_V2-768x361.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/head_explosion_V2-1536x723.png 1536w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/head_explosion_V2.png 1700w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>&nbsp;Ok… I’m not going to lie. I was surprised. But it wasn’t the first time I thought about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CloudLock was my second job out of college. My first job was working for Nuance Communications. I got a taste of what it might be like to lead a team when my boss went on vacation for two weeks. He nominated me to be the engineering contact for tech support while he was out. In those two weeks, my network within the company expanded, I got on customer calls for the first time and I got to see what it was like being responsible for more than just my own code. It was pretty fun and I was good at it!&nbsp;</p>



<p>That experience was in my mind that day while Michael and I were talking. I wanted to say yes but I had a million questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don’t remember his exact words, but he gist of what Michael said was “Don’t worry. You’re going to be great. I’ll help you and we’ll make it work together.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Michael is a really good guy. I trusted and respected him. So that was all I needed to hear.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>My first few months on the job&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Looking back on it, in those first few months, I didn’t really understand the job.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was going through the motions. Mimicking all of the things I had seen other dev team leads do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Don’t get me wrong. I did some good. But I also had quite a few struggles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For starters, every time there was a problem, I went into Superman mode. Single-handedly fixing it at the speed of light. After all, I was a great coder and had an expanding set of knowledge of the entire system. And I was good at helping other developers fix their problems. That is why I got promoted to team lead, right? (Kinda.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the team actually liked it at first. They acknowledged me for getting my hands dirty and being helpful and responsive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But some of the team didn’t like it. It came across as controlling. And the ones who liked it initially stopped liking it because they were making the same mistakes over and over again and not getting better. Our weaker devs stayed weak and our stronger devs weren’t growing.</p>



<p>There were more mistakes. Like when I waited too long to fire a bad developer who’s negative behavior was hurting the team.&nbsp;</p>







<h2><strong>8 things they didn’t tell me&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>I believe being a leader is a never-ending journey. There’s always more to learn. Thankfully, I had great mentors who taught me a lot. And I also learned some lessons the hard way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s 8 things I wish I knew back then.</p>







<h3><strong>1. Many of your skills don’t translate.&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>The cruel irony is that there is a reverse connection between strong individual dev skills and dev team lead skills. The strongest devs will have more of an uphill battle starting out as managers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>75% of the issues we face as a dev team lead are not technical. The job is mostly about people and processes. Once I realized this, everything changed for me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I could fix anything in the codebase. I was great at finding creative solutions to fix problems other devs were having. Not only are those skills not super relevant anymore, there are other traits of great devs that can actually hurt you as manager:&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Superman complex.</strong> If the team has a technical problem (bug, technical blocker), great devs often have the instinct to jump in and fix it right that second. In fact, when I did that as a dev, I received praise from my peers and leaders for being a great team player. As a manager when you do that, you’re the opposite of a team player.&nbsp;</p>

</picture>
</figure>







<p>Instead, we need to enable our people to solve the problem. Even if it takes longer the first time. Even if they make mistakes. Even if they don’t do it as well we would.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By helping your team figure it out, instead of doing it for them, you’ll get many benefits. Your people will see that you trust them. They’ll learn more. They’ll become more self-sufficient over time. And they’ll also learn to help each other which will bring the team closer together.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Avoid judgment at all costs. When your people feel free to get out of their comfort zone and make mistakes without fear of criticism, you’ll see their true creativity come out and you’ll be amazed at what they’re capable of.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p><strong>Pro tip: </strong>You can scale yourself by educating your people on your thought process. Help them understand why your instincts kicked in about a problem. Explain the process you go through to diagnose the issue. Explain your mental model for identifying fix options. Explain how you would communicate everything to the rest of the team.</p><p><strong>Deep focus.</strong> Another skill that did not serve me well as a manager was deep focus. As a dev, you have to get in the zone. I was good at locking in and focusing all of my energy on a single problem. That will kill you as a dev team lead.&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>Great leaders embrace context switching. They move around. They talk to a lot of people. If you find yourself locked in on a technical problem for hours, that’s probably a sign that you need to delegate more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you do have the luxury of deep focus time, use it to think about strategic initiatives. Like how to propose your next big non-functional investment to your executive team or the profile of your next three dev hires.</p>







<h3><strong>2. Keep your instincts. Change your behavior.&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Great devs have great instincts. Your intuition, which comes from your experiences, your expansive knowledge of the system, and your understanding of the end-to-end process, allows you to feel things even before you can even put your finger on exactly what it is. You sense when you went down the wrong path in your code. You sense when your team’s iteration is behind schedule.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Continue to hone these instincts. Just don’t act on them the same way you used to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You need your spidey sense even more now to figure out when others need help:</p>



<ul><li>When you hear something in your daily stand-up that doesn’t sound right.&nbsp;</li><li>When someone can’t find the root cause of a production issue.&nbsp;</li><li>When you’re helping out on a code review.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p>But if we aren’t jumping in like Spiderman to save the day, then what?&nbsp;</p>



<p>(Superman? Spiderman? Make up your mind, Dude! I know. Actually, Deadpool is my favorite superhero. What’s the best Deadpool quote about engineering leadership you ask? “House blowing up builds character.”)&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DP-1-1024x595.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DP-1-1024x595.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DP-1-300x174.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DP-1-768x446.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DP-1-1536x893.png 1536w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DP-1.png 1700w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>







<p>First, take a breath. I process things quickly but that can be a disadvantage as a manager. Keep listening and take extra time to process.</p>



<p>If you aren’t hearing enough info, ask questions. Gather as much information as possible before you offer any advice. Sometimes, just asking the right question helps your dev think about the issue in a new way and come up with a solution on their own.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Pro tip: </strong>The stand-up is an especially useful time to listen for things that might be slightly off. If I was <a href="https://linearb.io/blog/my-team-goes-home-on-time-every-night/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worried someone was not on track</a>, these questions always helped me figure out if I needed to dig deeper:</p>



<ul><li>Has (fill in the dev or team who is dependent on this work) reviewed this?</li></ul>



<ul><li>What are you thinking for scalability testing?</li><li>Tell me about your feature roll-out plan?</li></ul>







<h3><strong>3. Communicate “why” more than “what” and “how”.&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>As developers, we’re used to dealing with what and how. As dev managers, those are still relevant but it’s more important for us to focus on why.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s four reasons for this:</p>



<p><strong>Customer alignment:</strong> Product managers are hopefully delivering stories that clearly explain the customer problem and use case. But it’s still easy for devs to get in the weeds. If you constantly remind your team to come back to the problem and user experience, you’ll deliver a higher quality product more often.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Another question I Iike to ask when a dev is stuck: “Can you describe what your user is going to be doing before, during, and after using this feature?” If they can’t, they need more info.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Pro tip: </strong>Encourage your devs to listen to customer support calls and sales prospects calls. In my experience, lots of teams say they are going to do this then they don’t. At LinearB we have a rule (voted on by the team) that every dev attends two customer calls minimum every month.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Business alignment: </strong>A big part of being a dev leader is <a href="https://linearb.io/blog/being-vp-of-software-development-is-harder-than-being-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">translating executives to engineers</a> and aligning your team’s work to business objectives. I believe there is a business decision behind every line of code. Is the ultimate goal to acquire more customers and generate …</p></div></div></div>

                <div>
                    <p>This post explains the surprising link between math and juggling. Juggling theory is a beautiful example of how we can get more insight in a seemingly non-mathematical area by building a theory and proving stuff.</p><p>Most of this post doesn't assume any specialized mathematical background. Towards the end, basics of graph theory and number theory are used.</p><h2 id="what-is-juggling">What is juggling?</h2><p>Juggling is a recreational activity where a person manipulates multiple objects (usually balls, rings or clubs) by repeatedly throwing and catching them. If you haven't seen professional juggling before, I highly recommend watching this <a href="https://youtu.be/wP8tbLBls_M?t=32">amazing performance by Anthony Gatto</a>.</p><p>There are different <em>patterns</em> in juggling. The animations below depict three well-known patterns: cascade, shower and fountain.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The fundamental problem in juggling theory is how to succinctly describe a juggling pattern. I used GIF animations above to explain to you what cascade, shower and fountain mean, but we are interested in a way of representing juggling patterns that is much smaller (just a few characters long), reveals the <em>structure</em> of the pattern, and can be read and analyzed by machines. In 1981, Paul Klimek invented a way of associating a sequence of integers to each juggling pattern. This sequence of integers is called a <em>siteswap</em>, and it captures important properties of a jugging pattern. In this post, I'll show how to succinctly represent juggling patterns, and siteswaps form the most important part of this representation.</p><p>An amazing by-product of having such a representation is the ability to automate the process of inventing new patterns by brute-force enumeration of integer sequences. Previously, only non-beginner jugglers could invent patterns using hit-and-trial.</p><p>Another advantage of siteswaps is that they can be used as input to programs that create animations of juggling patterns. In fact, this is exactly how I created all the animations in this post, using <a href="https://jugglinglab.org/">Juggling Lab</a>.</p><h2 id="the-features-of-a-juggling-pattern">The features of a juggling pattern</h2><p>There are some assumptions that we'll impose on juggling patterns. These set of assumptions define our <em>model</em>. Here we will look at a model that is powerful enough to capture most of the well-known patterns and at the same time is simple enough to analyze.</p><p>Our first assumption is that we'll only look at patterns in the <em>steady state</em>, i.e. we won't worry about how the juggler <em>started</em> juggling. Alternatively, we can assume that the juggler started juggling at time $t=-\infty$ and will continue to juggle till time $t=\infty$.</p><p>A juggling pattern consists of several features that are orthogonal, i.e. the features can be varied independently of each other. We'll discuss some of the important features here, one of which is siteswap. We'll start with features that are easy to understand, and then move on to more complex but more important features.</p><h3 id="speed">Speed</h3><p>Every pattern can be made slower by throwing the objects higher.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><strong><strong>Assumption</strong></strong>: all throws are made at integral units of time.</p><p>A unit of time is called a <em>tick</em> or a <em>beat</em>. The speed of a pattern is defined by the duration of a tick in seconds.</p><h3 id="dwell">Dwell</h3><p>The amount of time the juggler holds an object in his/her hand is called <em>dwell</em>. Dwell is measured in ticks. Using a large dwell is called <em>lazy style</em> and using a small dwell is called <em>hot-potato style</em>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>For simplicity of presentation, assume that the dwell is the same for all throws/catches.</p><h3 id="hand-position">Hand position</h3><p>A pattern can be modified by changing the positions of hands during throws and catches. Hand positions can be specified using a coordinate system.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Reverse cascade is similar to the normal cascade, except that instead of throwing from the inside and catching on the outside, we throw from the outside and catch on the inside. (A careful observation will reveal that the reverse cascade is actually a time-reversed version of the normal cascade.)</p><p>By using more complicated hand-positions, we can get awesome variations of the cascade, that don't really look like the cascade.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>As stated before, hand positioning is independent of other features of the pattern. As an example, here are some hand positions applied to the fountain pattern:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="siteswap">Siteswap</h3><p>If you look at the first three animations (cascade, shower, fountain), they have the same hand-positioning and can be made to have the same speed and dwell. Yet these patterns look very different. The feature that differentiates them is the order in which objects are thrown and caught. This information is captured by siteswap. This is where things start getting mathematical!</p><p><strong>Assumption</strong>: <em>hands throw alternately</em>, i.e. at even ticks, the left hand throws and at odd ticks, the right hand throws. This assumption is called <em>asynchronicity</em>.</p><p><strong>Assumption</strong>: <em>a hand can only hold 1 object at a time.</em> This restriction is called <em>non-multiplexing</em>. (Most non-jugglers assume that non-multiplexing is mandatory for juggling, but that's not always true. We will, however, enforce non-multiplexing in our model.)</p><p>If all the other features (ticks per second, dwell, hand position) are fixed, then a juggling pattern can be uniquely determined by specifying two things for each throw: how high should the object be thrown, and whether the object is thrown to the same hand or to the other hand. (In the fountain pattern, all throws are made to the same hand, and in cascade all throws are made to the other hand.)</p><p>To specify how high an object is thrown, we associate a number with the throw, called <em>order</em> (also called <em>throw-order</em>). The order of a throw is defined to be the flight-time of a throw in ticks, plus the dwell. So if an object is thrown at time $t$ with order $x$, that object will be thrown next at time $t+x$. This implies that throw-orders must be integers.</p><p>Actually, we don't need to specify whether an object is thrown to the same hand or not, because that can be inferred from the throw order.</p><p><strong>Lemma 1</strong>: An object is thrown to the same hand iff the throw-order is even.</p><p><em>Proof</em>. Define the parity of an integer $y$ to be 1 if $y$ is odd and 0 if $y$ is even. Since hands throw alternately, the parity of the throwing time decides whether the object is thrown from the left hand or the right hand. Suppose an object is thrown at time $t$ with order $x$. Then it is thrown to the same hand iff the parities of $t$ and $t+x$ are the same, which happens iff $x$ is even. $\Box$</p><p><strong>Assumption</strong>: <em>patterns are periodic.</em> So, we only need to state the smallest repeating subsequence of the infinite sequence of throw orders. This finite-sized subsequence is called a siteswap. The length of this subsequence is called the period of the siteswap.</p><p>Looking at a pattern and figuring out its siteswap can be tricky at first, especially if you're new to juggling. I'll show some examples so that you get the hang of it.</p><h2 id="siteswap-examples">Siteswap Examples</h2><p>Let's start with the simplest pattern: cascade.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure>
    <img src="https://blog.bitsacm.in/content/images/2020/09/3-analyze.gif">
    <figcaption>Cascade</figcaption>
</figure><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Firstly, note that all throws are identical. So all throws have the same throw-order.</p><p>Suppose the blue ball is thrown at time $t$. At time $t+1$ the red ball is thrown, at time $t+2$ the green ball is thrown, and at time $t+3$ the blue ball is thrown again. Therefore, the time between consecutive throws of the blue ball is 3 ticks. Hence, all throws have order 3. This gives us the siteswap <code>[3]</code> for this pattern.</p><p>Let's now look at a pattern, which, as far as I know, doesn't have a common name. It's identified solely by its siteswap.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>We'll repeat the same trick as last time. Just keep noting down the colors of the throws. Denote the colors gray, red, green, blue by characters <code>_</code>, <code>r</code>, <code>g</code>, <code>b</code>, respectively. Then the colors of the throws is the string <code>_bg_rb_gr</code> repeated indefinitely. Now for each throw, find the next throw of the same color, and compute the difference of their throw-times to the get the throw-order. This gives us the sequence <code>[3, 4, 5]</code> repeated indefinitely.</p><figure><pre><code>_bg_rb_gr_bg_rb_gr_bg_rb_gr
34534534534534534534534
</code></pre><figcaption>Colors and orders of throws</figcaption></figure><p>Therefore, our siteswap is <code>[3, 4, 5]</code>. Usually people just concatenate the numbers together and write <code>345</code> instead of <code>[3, 4, 5]</code>. This is not a problem, since throw orders above 9 rarely arise in practice, and even if they do, we can use <code>a</code> for 10, <code>b</code> for 11, and so on.</p><h2 id="when-is-a-siteswap-valid">When is a siteswap valid?</h2><p>If we take an arbitrary sequence of integers, will it be the siteswap of some juggling pattern? As we'll see, the answer turns out to be "no". But why? Try to think about it before reading further. (Hint: Is <code>43</code> a valid siteswap? If yes, what does it look like? If no, why is it invalid?)</p><p>Turns out that to throw a ball, there must be a ball in your hand. If your throw-orders at odd ticks are odd and throw-orders at even ticks are even, balls will land in your hands only on even ticks, so at odd ticks, eventually you won't have any balls left to throw. But there's more. You also need to ensure that the number of balls landing in your hand at each tick is not more than 1. Otherwise, you'll have more balls than you can throw. Think of these two constraints as the equivalent of <em>conservation of mass</em>.</p><p>So how can we find out if a sequence of integers is a valid siteswap? I'll get straight to the point, like this:</p><p><strong>Permutation Theorem</strong>: Let $a = [a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}]$ be a sequence of $n$ non-negative integers. Let $\mathbb{Z}_n = \{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}$. For each $i \in \mathbb{Z}_n$, let $b_i = (i + a_i) \bmod n$. Then $a$ is a valid siteswap iff $b$ is a permutation of $\mathbb{Z}_n$.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote>
<p>Wait, <span>\(a\)</span> is a sequence of <em>non-negative</em> integers? What does a throw-order of 0 mean?
</p>
</blockquote><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Good question! That's a technical detail that I conveniently brushed under the rug. I'll address this at the end of the blog post. For now, you can assume that $a$ only has positive integers and throw orders can only be positive. The proofs work for the general case that includes zero-order throws.</p><p>The permutation theorem gives us the following $O(n)$-time algorithm (python code ahead):</p><pre><code>def is_valid(a):
    n = len(a)
    freq = [0] * n  # a …</code></pre></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="-codedoc-container"><p><em>It is ALMOST possible to express the bottom type in F#.</em></p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottom_type">bottom type</a> is the type that has no values.  It is useful as the return type of a function when every execution either does not terminate or throws an exception.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottom_type#In_programming_languages">Some languages</a> include the bottom type.  The <a href="https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-suggestions/issues/349">suggestion for F#</a> to add the bottom type was declined.  Interestingly, the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/538">suggestion for C#</a> to add the bottom type lives on.</p><p>Nevertheless, it is possible to define the bottom type in F#.  Here is how I would do it.</p><pre><code tabindex="0"><span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span><p><span>1<span><span data-ignore-text="">link</span></span></span><span>type</span> <span>Bottom</span> <span>=</span> <span>private</span> Bottom <span>of</span> <span>Bottom</span></p><br></code></pre><p>My original thought was to omit <code>of Bottom</code> and then have this line be alone in its module (so that a public function does not provide access to this private case constructor).  Then I read the suggestion to include <code>of Bottom</code> in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fsharp/comments/5dmo1f/f_logical_void_type/">this post on Reddit</a> from three years ago.  By including <code>of Bottom</code>, this <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/discriminated-unions">discriminated union</a> is a <a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/recursive-types-and-folds/">recursive type</a> but lacks a base case.  As such, it is clear from this one line that it is impossible to obtain an instance of <code>Bottom</code>.</p><p>In addition to having no values, there is another property of the bottom type.  In subtyping systems, it is a subtype of all types.  That is the motivation for the name "bottom".  It sits at the bottom of the type hierarchy.  My bottom type does not have this property.  I think the suggestion for F# to add the bottom type was specifically requesting this feature.</p><p><em>Added 2020-09-23</em></p><p>I just realized that this does not work as I had intended because <a href="https://fsharp.github.io/fsharp-core-docs/reference/fsharp-core-operators-unchecked.html#defaultof"><code>Unchecked.defaultof&lt;&gt;</code></a> exists.</p><pre><code tabindex="0"><span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>F# Interactive</span></span><p><span>1<span><span data-ignore-text="">link</span></span></span><span>&gt;</span> <span>type</span> <span>Bottom</span> <span>=</span> Bottom <span>of</span> <span>Bottom</span><span>;</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>2<span><span data-ignore-text="">link</span></span></span><span>type</span> <span>Bottom</span> <span>=</span> <span>|</span> Bottom <span>of</span> <span>Bottom</span></p><p><span>3<span><span data-ignore-text="">link</span></span></span></p><p><span>4<span><span data-ignore-text="">link</span></span></span><span>&gt;</span> Unchecked<span>.</span>defaultof<span>&lt;</span>Bottom<span>&gt;</span><span>;</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>5<span><span data-ignore-text="">link</span></span></span><span>val</span> it <span>:</span> <span>Bottom</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>null</span><span>&gt;</span></p><br></code></pre><p>This definition of <code>Bottom</code> is a reference type, and reference types can be <code>null</code>.  Now the recursive nature is a detriment.  I was aiming for a type with zero values, but I actually created a type with infinitely many values since <code>&lt;null&gt;</code>, <code>Bottom &lt;null&gt;</code>, <code>Bottom (Bottom &lt;null&gt;)</code>, and so on are a rather direct translation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding#Church_numerals">Church numerals</a>.</p><p>If we change <code>Bottom</code> to a <code>struct</code>, then the compiler complains about the recursive definition.</p><pre><code tabindex="0"><span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span><p><span>1<span><span data-ignore-text="">link</span></span></span><span><span>[&lt;</span><span>Struct</span><span>&gt;]</span></span></p><p><span>2<span><span data-ignore-text="">link</span></span></span><span>type</span> <span>Bottom</span> <span>=</span> Bottom <span>of</span> <span>Bottom</span></p><br></code></pre><blockquote><p>Error    FS0954 This type definition involves an immediate cyclic reference through a struct field or inheritance relation</p></blockquote><p>After removing <code>of Bottom</code> to make the type non-recursive, both the reference and struct variants of the definition now have exactly one value.  This is now just a more verbose way to define the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_type">unit type</a>, the type with just one value, which <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/unit-type">F# already has</a>.</p><p>My six-year-old daughter has been saying lately that "there is no perfect; there is only good enough".  I am going to take her advice here and be content with this approximation of the theoretically perfect bottom type in the pragmatic language that is F#.</p><hr><p>The <a href="https://connect-platform.github.io/coding-blog-plugin/tags">tags feature of Coding Blog Plugin</a> is still being developed.

Both male and female elephants of all ages died, with clinical signs limited to neurologic symptoms, said Taolo. The deaths happened mainly near seasonal water pans and did not spread beyond the initially affected region, he said.</p>  <p>"Mortality event characteristics and the field, clinical, postmortem, histopathological, and laboratory findings suggest the elephants died from neurotoxic cyanobacterium (blue-green alga) toxicosis associated with a toxic bloom of cyanobacterium in seasonal pans in the region," said Taolo.</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH|&nbsp;Mystery elephant deaths in Botswana:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><span></span><span>WARNING: Graphic images that may be disturbing to some.

He also ruled out human efforts like anthrax, poaching and sabotage.</p>  <p>"A monitoring plan of seasonal water-pans on a regular basis to track such future occurrences will be instituted immediately and will also include capacity building to monitor and test for toxins produced ... by cyanobacteria," said Taolo.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>Should you join a big company or start a startup?</p>
<p>This frequently debated question paints a picture of a world where the only choice is between being a cog at a giant semi-monopoly, or taking investment money in the hopes of one day growing to be head cog at a giant semi-monopoly.</p>
<p>Role models matter. So I made a list of small companies that I admire. Neither giants nor startups - just people making a living writing software on their own terms.</p>
<h2 id="sqlite"><a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">sqlite</a></h2>
<p>Sqlite is an existence proof that you don't need a thousand engineers to have an impact. It's been around since the early 90s, is one of the <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html">most shipped</a> pieces of software in existence and is widely respected for its <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/testing.html">exceptional testing methodology</a>. Yet it was written almost entirely by a few people:</p>
<pre><span>jamie@machine:~/sqlite$ git shortlog -s -n | head -n 5
 14012	drh
  4297	dan
  1663	danielk1977
  1099	mistachkin
   175	shane
</span></pre>
<p>Their growth plans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hwaci is a small company but it is also closely held and debt-free and has low fixed costs, which means that it is largely immune to buy-outs, take-overs, and market down-turns. Hwaci intends to continue operating in its current form, and at roughly its current size until at least the year 2050. We expect to be here when you need us, even if that need is many years in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sqlite is also interesting because although the code is open source they operate on a cathedral model, generally <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html">refusing or rewriting</a> outside contributions.</p>
<h2 id="pinboard"><a href="https://pinboard.in/">pinboard</a></h2>
<p>Pinboard is a single-person operation that has been making a solid income year on year <a href="https://blog.pinboard.in/2019/07/i_cant_stop_winning/">since 2010</a>. It somehow still leaves Maciej enough free time to go around <a href="https://idlewords.com/2019/5/">teaching politicians how to not get hacked</a> and <a href="https://idlewords.com/talks/senate_testimony.2019.5.htm">explaining privacy to the senate</a>. All the while <a href="https://blog.pinboard.in/2017/06/pinboard_acquires_delicious/">destroying his competition</a> using highly advanced tactics such as <a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/fan_is_a_tool_using_animal.htm">listening to his customers</a> and not operating at a loss.</p>
<p>But if Maciej had done nothing else he would still be on this list for his beautiful talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vt8zqhHe_c">Barely Succeed! It's Easier!</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We live in a remarkable time when small teams (or even lone programmers) can successfully compete against internet giants. But while the last few years have seen an explosion of product ideas, there has been far less innovation in how to actually build a business. Silicon Valley is stuck in an outdated 'grow or die' mentality that overvalues risk, while investors dismiss sustainable, interesting projects for being too practical. So who needs investors anyway?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll talk about some alternative definitions of success that are more achievable (and more fun!) than the Silicon Valley casino. It turns out that staying small offers some surprising advantages, not just in the day-to-day experience of work, but in marketing and getting customers to love your project. Best of all, there's plenty more room at the bottom.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If your goal is to do meaningful work you love, you may be much closer to realizing your dreams than you think.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="tarsnap"><a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/">tarsnap</a></h2>
<p>Another single-person operation, tarsnap has reported been profitable <a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/about.html">since 2009</a> and shows no sign of going anywhere, even lowering it's prices over the years as storage became cheaper. It's saved me on multiple occasions and it's so simple, reliable and cheap that I think of it almost like a utility - tarsnap having an outage would be more surprising to me than water not coming out of my taps.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting things about tarsnap is that it could <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2014/04/03/fantasy-tarsnap/">easily be making more money</a>. If tarsnap had investors or shareholders, they would have <strong>already forced Colin to do so</strong>. In other words, the only reason that Colin gets to continue running the kind of business that he <strong>wants</strong> to run is that he owns it entirely and noone can force him to maximize profit instead.</p>
<h2 id="sublime"><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">sublime</a></h2>
<p>Version 1.0 came out in <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/one-point-oh">2008</a> and they're still going strong today, making enough to <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/small-tech/">hire an extra developer</a> and <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/sublime-merge">launch a separate product</a>.</p>
<p>Sublime is notable for surviving despite massive open-source competition in a field where people hate to pay for tools. As <a href="https://thume.ca/2017/03/04/my-text-editor-journey-vim-spacemacs-atom-and-sublime-text/">Tristan Hume points out</a>, it's really the only editor that has managed to remain both fast and consistent while still supporting a large plugin ecosystem. These kind of end-to-end qualities are perhaps one of the main advantages for small teams with a long time horizon.</p>
<h2 id="zig"><a href="https://ziglang.org/">zig</a></h2>
<p>Zig has been around <a href="https://andrewkelley.me/post/full-time-zig.html">only a few years</a> but I'm already wildly impressed by the quality of thought and engineering that has gone into it.</p>
<p>The Zig Software Foundation is a non-profit, currently funded entirely by donations and working towards being able to employ a second full-time developer. They explicitly chose to be a non-profit out of concern over how profit incentives creep into daily decision making:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In You Weren’t Meant to Have a Boss, Paul Graham makes an analogy between animals in the zoo (employees) and animals in the wild (startup founders). I think he’s on to something, but when you start a startup, you still have a boss. In fact, you have the same boss. At the end of the day, it is an inescapable fact that you must do what makes a profit, for the shareholders.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The difference in incentives makes a structural difference that permeates every part of an organization. Windows users wake up one day and find ads in their start menu. Will Debian Linux ever try to put ads into any of its software? The concept is absurd.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Zig was explicitly designed to be a <a href="https://ziglang.org/#Small-simple-language">small, simple language</a>, allowing it to be maintained indefinitely by a small, committed team.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ZSF is a small organization and makes efficient use of monetary resources.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t see the need for ZSF to grow beyond a handful of people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Maciej <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vt8zqhHe_c&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2144">puts it</a>, one of the advantages of being small is that you can speak with a human voice. This comes across clearly from the zig team, who are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8f48iYKxgg">resolutely human</a> instead of projecting some impassive facade of professionalism.</p>

<p><em>This is the fourth of a 5-part series on AWS exploits and similar findings discovered over the course of 2020. All findings discussed in this series have been <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/">disclosed</a> to the AWS security team and had patches rolled out to all affected regions, where necessary. A big thanks to my friend and fellow Australian <a href="https://twitter.com/__steele">Aidan Steele</a> for co-authoring this series with me. This post was written by Aidan.</em></p>

<p>Back in November 2019, AWS CloudFormation <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/11/now-extend-aws-cloudformation-to-model-provision-and-manage-third-party-resources/">added support</a> for “resource providers” - a new and improved way of extending CloudFormation with user-authored resources. Not just that, it is also the way that all new resources are added to CloudFormation by AWS themselves. This was a substantial improvement over “custom resources”, which hadn’t seen any change since at least 2013 other than <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2015/04/aws-cloudformation-supports-aws-lambda-backed-custom-resources/">Lambda support in 2015</a>. This post won’t get into the differences or benefits of resource providers, for that check out <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/managing-resources-using-aws-cloudformation-resource-types/">this AWS blog post</a>.</p>

<p>On January 17th, <a href="https://twitter.com/ben11kehoe">Ben Kehoe</a> CloudFormation extraordinaire sent me a Twitter DM with a link to a GitHub <a href="https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-cli-python-plugin/pull/71">pull request</a> that set off his spidey-senses. I was excited to receive this because a) Ben thought of me! and b) it combined CloudFormation and credentials in the cloud in a novel way, two of my favourite things. This was the excuse I needed to finally dig into resource providers - albeit not until the 21st when I had some time.</p>

<h2 id="pulling-things-apart">Pulling things apart</h2>

<p>The first thing I noticed is that (unlike custom resources) the Lambda function you are authoring ends up not running in your AWS account - it runs in an AWS-managed account. I was immediately curious about what permissions <strong>my</strong> code had in <strong>their</strong> account - you’d hope it’s locked down! I was also curious about how the code I wrote appeared to have a role in my account - where was the role being assumed?</p>

<p>Rather than try to understand the framework provided by CloudFormation and how things are <strong>meant</strong> to work, I decided to drop down a level and log the raw input to the Lambda function, to see how things <strong>actually</strong> work. This is an excerpt of the input passed to the Lambda when a resource is being created:</p>

<p><img src="https://onecloudplease.com/images/posts/security-september-2.png" alt=""></p>

<p>So there are at least <strong>four</strong> different sets of credentials in play here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <code>callerCredentials</code>: These are the credentials that I am expected to use. They are for the role assumed in <strong>my</strong> account to actually create, update, delete, etc the resource in question.</li>
  <li>The <code>providerCredentials</code>: These are the credentials for the <code>LogAndMetricsDeliveryRole</code> role in the <code>CloudFormationManagedUploadInfrastructure</code> stack, i.e. for writing logs that appear in <strong>my</strong> account.</li>
  <li>The (not pictured) Lambda execution role’s credentials: this appears to have permission only to write logs within the AWS-managed account.</li>
  <li>The <code>platformCredentials</code>: These are the interesting ones. They are for a role in the AWS-managed account. That role has permission to call a handful of permissions, but the ones that caught my eye were <code>events:PutRule</code>, <code>events:PutTarget</code>, <code>events:RemoveTarget</code>, <code>events:DeleteRule</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why does the Lambda function need permission to invoke those EventBridge APIs? Resource creation might take a long time and Lambda is limited to 15 minutes, so the service has support for reinvoking the Lambda periodically to ask “is it done yet?” and EventBridge cron jobs are a great fit for this. The way it works is by creating a one-off rule scheduled to run one minute in the future, with a target of the same Lambda. It specifies that the Lambda should be reinvoked with a hardcoded input string - namely the input that <strong>this</strong> invocation of the Lambda received.</p>

<h2 id="curiosity-intensifies">Curiosity intensifies</h2>

<p>This piqued my curiosity. What if I used the API to trigger a different target, like a Lambda in my account? No luck, they must have used the <code>events:TargetArn</code> condition key to restrict the target to only this Lambda. So I tried something else: what if instead I tried a different rule? I tried to create a rule that would invoke my Lambda in their account that matched events with <code>{"detail-type": ["AWS API Call via CloudTrail"]}</code>. I was immediately inundated with a firehose of events. I rushed to turn it off as it wasn’t my intention to break things, just curiosity.</p>

<p>I looked at the events. Was this really a security issue or more a “that’s cute” kind of thing? Most events were uninteresting. But one caught my eye. It was a call to <code>events:PutTarget</code>. The CloudTrail event included the payload. I’ve highlighted the noteworthy part.</p>

<p><img src="https://onecloudplease.com/images/posts/security-september-3.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In order to reinvoke the function a minute later with the same payload, we established earlier that the target was created with a constant JSON input. That input includes credentials for a role in the customer’s account. Multiple (all?) customers are serviced by the AWS-managed account. So I could see credentials for other AWS customers using resource providers. They might be using it without realising: AWS are using this pattern for first-party types - I saw <code>AWS::WAFv2::RuleGroup</code> fly by in the logs.</p>



<p>That afternoon I reported the issue to the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/">AWS security team</a>. They got back to me within 9 hours. They asked for some clarification (fair, I was a bit frazzled when I wrote the first email!) and any reproduction steps I could provide. Given I’d slapped together a very manual proof-of-concept, I set about creating a more useful reproduction for them.</p>

<p>The CloudFormation service team also reached out to me. They indicated that they had actually already caught this internally and a fix was underway. A few days later on January 25th, they told me that a fix had been deployed to a couple of regions and asked if I could try again. A few minutes later, I got a follow up from the AWS security team with the same request - things move surprisingly quickly at AWS!</p>

<p>I tried again. After creating my rule I got a few events, but it quickly dried up without me even needing to turn it off. I looked through the events recorded. I didn’t see any of those problematic ones before, no matter how many times I tried. I did see this interesting one though:</p>

<p><img src="https://onecloudplease.com/images/posts/security-september-4.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Clever! They had created an alarm that would trigger whenever a malicious rule was created. This was a solid tactical mitigation. Unfortunately the IAM policy conditions available on <code>events:PutRule</code> weren’t rich enough to block me outright, but this stopped the bleeding. I also noticed the unusual absence of any of the <code>events:PutTarget</code> API call events. I don’t know how they did this as omitting those from CloudTrail/EventBridge isn’t possible for customers’ accounts. I guess AWS have some secret sauce.</p>

<h2 id="closing-out">Closing out</h2>

<p>On January 31st I got a follow up email from AWS Security letting me know that the issue has been resolved.</p>

<p>On June 30th the CloudFormation team released version 2 of the resource provider protocol. It came with a number of benefits, but the change most visible to me was that the <code>platformCredentials</code> field had disappeared. It is no longer necessary as CloudFormation itself handles the reinvocation of the Lambda function.</p>

<p>Finally, on August 26th AWS sent out the following email, gently encouraging people to migrate to the new protocol for resource providers. I wouldn’t be surprised if this was followed by an eventual deprecation of v1.</p>

<p><img src="https://onecloudplease.com/images/posts/security-september-5.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="thanks">Thanks</h2>

<p>I’d like to thank Ben Kehoe for pointing this out to me in the first place. Without his keen eye and intuition for sensible security, I would have never noticed this. I’d like to thank Ian for being a great sounding board throughout the process. His <a href="https://twitter.com/iann0036/status/1161871038336028672">tweets</a> last year about Lake Formation issues made me feel confident that AWS would respond positively to my email. I’d also like to thank the AWS Security team who made me feel very comfortable both reporting my first issue and that it was being addressed in a thorough and impressively timely fashion. And a second thanks to Ian for motivating me to write my first blog posts in years!</p>

problemfreiÂ», heisst es auf der Internetseite des schweizerischen AussenÂ­ministeriums EDA.</p><p>Das ist ziemlich geschwurbelt. Denn zwischen den beiden Staaten herrscht gerade dicke Luft.</p><p>Am 15. Oktober hÃ¤tte in Stockholm ein feierliches Dinner stattfinden sollen. Zu den hochkarÃ¤tigen GÃ¤sten hÃ¤tten Bundesrat Ignazio Cassis (59) und seine schwedische Amtskollegin Ann Linde (58) gehÃ¶rt. Â­Anlass ist das 100-Jahr-Â­JubilÃ¤um der diplomatischen Â­Beziehungen zwischen der Eidgenossenschaft und dem KÃ¶nigreich; die Schweiz hat seit 1920 in Stockholm eine Â­eigene Gesandtschaft.</p><p>Doch daraus wird nichts. Das schwedische Aussenministerium hat den Termin diese Woche Â­platzen lassen. Eine befreundete Regierung derart vor den Kopf zu stossen, ist ein hÃ¶chst unÃ¼bÂ­liches ManÃ¶ver.</p><p>Den Grund fÃ¼r den diplomaÂ­tischen Eklat lieferte Ann Lindes Ministerium gleich mit: Die AbÂ­sage an Cassis wird explizit mit dem Verweis auf einen Entscheid des Bundesrats in der Crypto-Â­ AffÃ¤re begrÃ¼ndet, wie gut informierte Quellen gegenÃ¼ber SonntagsBlick Â­berichten.</p><p><h3>Tradition der NeutralitÃ¤tspolitik</h3></p><p>Im Juni hatte die LandesÂ­regierung entschieden, dass die Firma Crypto International AG im zugerischen Steinhausen keine ChiffriergerÃ¤te mehr exportieren darf. Der Beschluss besiegelt das Ende des Unternehmens, das durch seine neuen EigentÃ¼mer in schwedischer Hand ist. 80 Mitarbeiter werden auf die Strasse gestellt.</p><p>Das ist aber nur einer der GrÃ¼nde fÃ¼r den Zorn aus dem Norden â€“ vor allem kÃ¶nnen die Skandinavier nun keine Cyber-Security-Software mehr beziehen. Obwohl doch das Land wie die Schweiz eine Tradition der NeutralitÃ¤tspolitik und der Guten Dienste kennt.</p><p>Der Entscheid des Bundesrats fiel vor dem Hintergrund der sogenannten Cryptoleaks-AffÃ¤re. SRF und Tamedia machten im Â­Februar Details dazu bekannt, wie die Firma Crypto AG in Zug wÃ¤hrend des Kalten Krieges ChiffrierÂ­gerÃ¤te in alle Welt exportiert hatte â€“ und dabei von der amerikanischen CIA und dem Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) Ã¼berwacht wurde.</p><p>Obwohl es sich bei der Crypto International AG um ein NachÂ­folgeunternehmen handelt und die Besitzer beteuern, dass das Â­GeschÃ¤ft nichts mehr mit der Â­alten Crypto AG zu tun hat, griff der Bundesrat unter dem mediÂ­alen und politischen Druck zum ZweihÃ¤nder.</p><p><h3>Beide rÃ¼hmen sich als Friedensstifter</h3></p><p>Im EDA ist man schlecht auf Wirtschaftsminister Guy Parmelin (60) zu sprechen. Dessen Staatssekretariat fÃ¼r Wirtschaft (Seco) hat mit einer Strafanzeige gegen Unbekannt die aktuelle Â­Entwicklung erst ins Rollen gebracht und war ein Treiber des ExportÂ­verbots.</p><p>Jetzt mÃ¼ssen Bundesrat Ignazio Cassis und seine Verwaltung die Suppe auslÃ¶ffeln. Dem Vernehmen nach haben auch andere befreundete Staaten beim Aussendepartement gegen das Exportverbot protestiert.</p><p>GegenÃ¼ber SonntagsBlick hÃ¤lt man sich beim EDA mit O-TÃ¶nen zurÃ¼ck. Man bestÃ¤tigt aber die Â­Recherchen: Â«Zur Feier des Â­hundertjÃ¤hrigen Bestehens der diplomatischen Beziehungen zwischen der Schweiz und Schweden war auch ein Treffen auf Aussenministerebene vorÂ­gesehen. Dieses Treffen wird gemÃ¤ss heutigem Kenntnisstand nicht stattfinden.Â»</p><p>Nun gilt es, das Kriegsbeil zu begraben. Eine Gemeinsamkeit der zwei LÃ¤nder sollte Hoffnung machen: Beide rÃ¼hmen sich als Friedensstifter in internatioÂ­nalen Konflikten.</p></div><div><div title="Publiziert: 19.09.2020, 23:36 Uhr"><p>Publiziert: 19.09.2020, 23:36 Uhr</p></div><div title="Zuletzt aktualisiert: 19.09.2020, 23:50 Uhr"><p>Zuletzt aktualisiert: 19.09.2020, 23:50 Uhr</p></div></div></div>]]>

        <p>Published on: 2020-09-22</p>
        
<p>What do I mean by using exceptions as a control flow mechanism?</p>
<h2>I - Exceptions as control flow mechanism</h2>
<p>The gist of it is replacing something like:</p>
<pre><code>if isinstance(a, duck):
    a.quack()
else:
    bar()
</code></pre>
<p>With something like:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    a.quack()
except:
    bar()
</code></pre>
<p>Writing control flows using an if/switch/etc involves thinking about something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unde what conditions should I perform this operation and what should I do if those conditions aren't true?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Writing control flows using exception switched that paradigm to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If this operation fails, what should I try instead?</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>An example that I encountered in the real world:</p>
<p>As part of a data cleaning script, I had to determine if a float different from <code>NaN</code> in python. But really, what I wanted to ask was: "Can I use this variable of type float/np.float/whatever in basic numerical operations without raising exceptions or running into undefined behavior ?".</p>
<p>The obvious way to do that is something like: <code>math.isnan(number)</code>, right?</p>
<p>Well, technically correct, as long as your definition of <code>NaN</code> is the same as the one python has. But under my definition, this will fail in cases like the following: <code>np.isnan(float('inf'))</code>.</p>
<p>So I have to write a function like:</p>
<pre><code>def is_invalid_float(nr):
    if np.isnan(nr):
    	return True
    elif np.isinf(nr):
    	return True
    else:
    	return False
</code></pre>
<p>This has some disadvantages:</p>
<p>a) I have to know about the fact that a floating-point variable can be both <code>nan</code> and <code>inf</code>.</p>
<p>b) I may still be missing some edge cases in which a float typed variable can lead to UB or exception throwing in numeric operations.</p>
<p>c) It's a somewhat complex function, instead of a one-liner calling an external function.</p>
<p>The exception-based version looks something like:</p>
<pre><code>def is_invalid_float(nr):
    try:
    	int(nr)
    	return False
    except:
    	return True
</code></pre>
<p>Much better, right?</p>
<p>Well, arguably. Going through my complaints above:</p>
<p>a) I have to know about the fact that a floating-point variable can be both <code>nan</code> and <code>inf</code>. -- I don't have to know this, if I implemented my <code>nan</code> check like this to being with, I would have been safe and sound never knowing about <code>inf</code>.</p>
<p>b) I may still be missing some edge cases in which a float typed variable can lead to UB or exception throwing in numeric operations. -- Well, I might still be missing some edge cases, but there's a higher chance I won't be, since I can assume other "strange" things that may be of type <code>float</code> respect the rule 'if it's a non-numeric floating-point typed variable I can't make an integer out of it".</p>
<p>c) It's still a somewhat complex function. Shorter, but it's less obvious what kind of values (<code>nan</code> and <code>inf</code>) caused the need for this check.</p>
<p>More importantly, I'm losing potentially valid floats that can't be converted to integers for some other reasons.</p>
<p><em>Note: as far as I know there are no other "edge cases" for floating-point numbers in python other than nan and inf and any other floating-point numbers will be int-convertible on an x86 CPython RE. This is an example for illustrative purposes</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Ok, let's look at a stronger example:</p>
<p>Let's say I have a string and I need to check it's a read-only MariaDB query, something that only selects data rather than inserting, modifying, or deleting it.</p>
<p>Well, I can use an external SQL parser to tell me if the query is valid and contains mutable keywords or I can try to check for them myself, or I can:</p>
<pre><code>def is_read_only_query():
    with  new_connection() as conn:
    	try:
    		conn.execute('SET SESSION TRANSACTION READ ONLY')
    		conn.execute(query_string)
    		return True
    	except:
    		return False
</code></pre>
<p>Is this a bullet-proof solution?</p>
<p>I don't know, I wouldn't use it to prevent a SQL injection from a skilled and malicious actor. But it can avoid a <a href="https://xkcd.com/327/">"Robert); DROP TABLE Students;"</a> kind of scenario and it can certainly avoid a mistake by a clumsy database operator with the best of intentions but a habit of too readily copy-pasting stuff from stack overflow.</p>
<hr>
<p>What I'm saying here is not revolutionary, at least not for certain languages, catching an exception is often the recommended way to check if an object can be cast to a different type in python.</p>
<p>I think where people would get a bit more itchy is when seeing something like:</p>
<pre><code>def determine_type(text):
    try:
    	sum(list(text))
    	return 'list of numbers'
    except:
    	try:
    		int(text)
    		return 'int'
    	except:
    		try:
    			float(text)
    			return 'float'
    		except:
    			return 'other'
</code></pre>
<p>To me, the above code looks like the "correct" way to check if <code>text</code> is a list of numbers, integer, float, or a string representing something else.</p>
<p>But I can understand the reluctance to use these kinds of control flows. They are really ugly in terms of brackets or indentation, so getting past 6 or 7 layers of this can get unreadable. There is no easy workaround for this in dialects that people are familiar with.</p>
<p>But, what if we keep it short and sweet? What's the disadvantage of exception-based control flow?</p>
<h2>II - Stack Overflow on why it's bad</h2>
<p>I'm curious what the answer is if I google "Exceptions as control flow". I tried a few queries, this one returned varied results which bought up good points, so I stuck with it, but this is not an exhaustive list of arguments against the practice.</p>
<p>First, let's look at some of the most upvoted answers (in order of votes) on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/729379/why-not-use-exceptions-as-regular-flow-of-control">the Stack Overflow question on</a> the subject:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever tried to debug a program raising five exceptions per second in the normal course of operation ?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I have.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The program was quite complex (it was a distributed calculation server), and a slight modification at one side of the program could easily break something in a completely different place.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I wish I could just have launched the program and wait for exceptions to occur, but there were around 200 exceptions during the start-up <em>in the normal course of operations</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My point: <strong>if you use exceptions for normal situations, how do you locate unusual (ie _exception_al) situations?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course, there are other strong reasons not to use exceptions too much, especially performance-wise</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the performance bit is very niche, in code that gets execute thousands of times per second in a high-performance application it matters. But "programming" becomes very different when focusing on performance (e.g. we might write logic that looks counter-intuitive to us but results in fewer cache misses), and for 99% of code, this doesn't matter.</p>
<p>Granted, there's some language in which exceptions are really (and I mean *** really) slow, but others, such as Python, have fairly efficient exceptions so performance shouldn't be an issue for any program that should have been written in Python to being with.</p>
<p>The first point the commenter brings up sounds much more persuasive. Namely that exceptions, even when caught, are something one should care about.</p>
<p>I.e. my code might throw an exception during runtime and I'll catch it and try to handle the situation and move forward as best I can, but I need to see those exceptions when debugging.</p>
<p>This is a valid argument but there are two ways we can deal with this:</p>
<p>a) Add some code to indicate a specific <code>catch</code> is not meant to occur</p>
<p>b) Have specific exceptions for situations that should not happen (i.e. an "TheFactThatThisHappenedIsBadPleasePayAttention" exception class)</p>
<p>But still, this means that you'd have to potentially redesign your codebase a bit if you wanted to use exceptions as a control flow mechanism and still make use of their power to signal potential errors without crashing the whole program to do so.</p>
<p>The second answer in that same thread is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Exceptions are basically non-local goto statements with all the consequences of the latter. Using exceptions for flow control violates a <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PrincipleOfLeastAstonishment">principle of least astonishment</a>, make programs hard to read (remember that programs are written for programmers first).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Moreover, this is not what compiler vendors expect. They expect exceptions to be thrown rarely, and they usually let the throw code be quite inefficient. Throwing exceptions is one of the most expensive operations in .NET.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>However, some languages (notably Python) use exceptions as flow-control constructs. For example, iterators raise a StopIteration exception if there are no further items. Even standard language constructs (such as for) rely on this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again the performance argument, but at least with the added caveat that indeed in some languages this is a none issue.</p>
<p>The more interesting point is that exceptions are harder to reason about since you're not sure where they are thrown, take for example the following code:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    a()
    b()
    c()
except:
    foo()
</code></pre>
<p>When calling <code>foo</code> here we can't know why <code>foo</code> was called (i.e. was it because of a failure in <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> or <code>c</code> ?).</p>
<p>If it's non-obvious where an exception might be thrown one can simply implement multiple exception catching constructs (in the above case one for each function that is called).</p>
<p>But then again, I think this argument doesn't hold much water when we consider something like:</p>
<pre><code>if not a() or not b() or not c():
    foo()
</code></pre>
<p>Not knowing what code triggered an exception because multiple bits of it can throw is the same as not knowing what code triggered an if because multiple bits of it can set the True/False value that it evaluates.</p>
<p>This isn't a fault with exceptions, just a general issue one can introduce using any control flow mechanism.</p>
<p>Other than that, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/621338/necromancer">necromancer</a> makes an interesting point in that thread, but most other arguments seem to follow the same ideas but phrased more poorly.</p>
<h2>III - Stack Exchange SE on why exceptions are bad</h2>
<p>Next, let's look at a <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/189222/are-exceptions-as-control-flow-considered-a-serious-antipattern-if-so-why">fairly popular post on the software engineering stack exchange</a>.</p>
<p>Why are exceptions bad?</p>
<p>Well, <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/4091/blueberryfields">blueberryfields</a> makes a few arguments for why they should be considered an anti-pattern. Let's take these one by one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Exceptions are, in essence, sophisticated GOTO statements</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They aren't, they have stricter rules than goto statements. …</p></div></div>

          <p>
    Posted on September 16, 2020
    
</p>

<p>If I were to travel back in time 4 years ago, and tell my old self that Haskell was starting to lose its shine, I wouldn’t believe it. I grew up on Haskell, my appetite for category theory was whetted by Haskell, my biggest programming projects have been in Haskell, and my dream job was to work at a company that used Haskell.</p>
<p>But now, I find myself simply not as excited about Haskell as I used to be. What changed?</p>
<p>I think there are a couple things. I think one primary factor is that the kind of programming that Haskell really excells in; i.e.&nbsp;creating abstract, correct interfaces for things, is just not a type of programming that’s interesting to me anymore. When I wanted to work on software as a career, a language that allowed incredible facilities in not repeating yourself was very useful. Types that ensure correctness of data interchange, or lenses that allow access to complicated data structures are all very well for implementing, say, a compiler, or complicated business logic in a web backend. However, my interests in software are now primarily as a scientific/mathematical tool. Numerical algorithms can be done in Haskell, but they don’t really gain much benefit from the type system, and they also don’t have great library support.</p>
<p>No doubt Haskell could be made into the kind of language to use for the problems that I am interested in, but given the choice between working on the problems that interest me, and working on infrastructure for the problems that interest me, I would rather work on the problems that interest me. The general feeling that I have is that Haskell is a great tool for a software engineer, but I don’t want to be a software engineer, I want to be a mathematician that sometimes uses computers.</p>
<p>But there is another reason too. While I think that Haskell is still a great language, it is close to 30 years old at this point. It manages to stay fresh and relevant with an ever-growing list of extensions, and constantly changing best practices and libraries (which is itself a problem…), but it would be very sad if we as a society of programmers had failed to surpass it in any respect with any of the programming languages that have had the advantage of starting from a clean slate. In this post, I want to talk about these successor languages, and what I think about them.</p>
<h2 id="rust">Rust</h2>
<p>Surprisingly, one of Haskell’s great strengths is as a systems language. It manages to be much faster than most dynamic languages, while allowing a much higher-level interface than traditional systems languages like C (obviously). One great example of a “systems” program written in Haskell is git-annex. It is a git addition that adds tracking of large files, and was my primary backup system for a long time (I eventually decided that I didn’t need the additional power from it, and was better served by a more seamless solution).</p>
<p>However, in 2020, the premier system’s language is surely Rust. It would be unfair to compare the performance of Rust and Haskell, because Haskell is optimized for things other than performance. That being said, Rust is <em>faster</em> and <em>lower-latency</em> than Haskell, both of which are important. However, it also has a great type system, unlike C or C++ (we don’t talk about Go…). The type system in Rust is obviously very influenced by the type system of Haskell, but they also implemented “ownership” which allows for the killer feature garbage-collection free automatic memory management.</p>
<p>When I first started using Rust, I really missed monads. But here’s the thing. Having used lots of monads in Haskell, and read lots of blog posts about monads, I’ve learned that in systems contexts, it’s often best to just have a simple monad stack that just consists of Reader + IO (and Maybe’s and Option’s sprinkled about occasionally). Huge monad transformer stacks often raise more problems than they solve. But Reader + IO is <em>essentially</em> the “default monad stack” of Rust.</p>
<p>Rust also has some other killer features, like the ability to compile to webassembly (yes there is ghcjs, but, really, do you want to use ghcjs?) It also from the beginning was targetted towards industry, and consequentially has a much more vibrant ecosystem.</p>
<p>This all being said, I think it is worth looking at the features that are prominent in Haskell that ended up going to Rust</p>
<ul>
<li>Typeclasses (in Rust they are Traits)</li>
<li>Sum types (you may take this for granted, but a lot of languages don’t have them….)</li>
<li>Pervasive pattern matching</li>
<li>Hindley-Mindler type inference (automatic type inference for variables)</li>
<li>Pervasiveness of things being <em>expressions</em> rather than statements</li>
<li>Parametric Polymorphism</li>
<li>The feeling that once your program compiles, it will run</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that we should recognize Rust for what it is, a child of Haskell and the Haskell community, and like all good parents, we should want it to do better than the previous generation. In as much as Haskell is the ideas that form Haskell, the success of Rust is the success of Haskell.</p>
<h2 id="idris">Idris</h2>
<p>OK, mainstream programming languages are great, but sometimes you just want to make the perfect type-based interface to your stuff and show the imperative scrubs what a wiz-kid you are. Or alternatively, sometimes you really care that your software is correct. Or you want to concretize a new category-theory inspired design for a part of a compiler. Nowadays, the language for that is not Haskell, it is Idris.</p>
<p>There are about six different ways to sort of have dependent types in Haskell (types that depend on values, like a length-<span>n</span>) array. I don’t really fully understand any of them, and it is totally unclear to me how they work together. Presumably, there are blogs which outline the One True Way, but… it’s tough. In Idris, it just seems perfectly natural to use dependent types, like, why wouldn’t you able to have a type parameter which was a value? In many ways other than dependent types, Idris is a much cleaner language than Haskell too. And with Idris2, it has support for <em>linear types</em>, which allow mutability in a functional context via guarantees that nobody is going to try and use the old value. If I want to play around with a cool type system in a language that can also actually do things with the real world (i.e., unlike Agda or Coq), I would go to Idris rather than Haskell.</p>
<p>But Idris is undeniably Haskell’s child. The first version was written in Haskell (it is now self-hosting). They are similar in more ways than it is worth counting. Enough said.</p>
<h2 id="julia">Julia</h2>
<p>Unlike the first two, Julia doesn’t really muscle into Haskell’s territory. Scientific computing was never really Haskell’s forte, despite there being some very cool libraries written in it, like <code>ad</code> for autodifferentiation, or various array-handling packages that automatically fused consecutive array operations.</p>
<p>Also, Julia is a dynamically typed language. How could a filthy dynamically typed language ever claim to be Haskell’s child??</p>
<p>Well, for one it steals some of those cool libraries, and makes them much better! Flux is a neural networks library which essentially is just autodifferentiation + some nice utilities, and it is already competitive in my mind with TensorFlow. Julia also has StaticArrays, which integrates the size of the array into the type, and Julia has some neat fusion abilities too for making array operations really fast.</p>
<p>But wait, you ask, how can it do this if it’s not a statically typed language? Well, Julia is not your average dynamically typed language. It actually has a very interesting type system, a full discussion of which is beyond the scope of this post, and the focus on types as the unit of programming is (somewhat?) similar to Haskell (now I’m stretching it a little though).</p>
<p>The real reason I include Julia, however, is because for me personally, it has replaced Haskell as the place to do category theory. This is because of a shift of viewpoint: rather than providing a type system into which category theory can be embedded in to guide typical software engineering tasks, Julia provides a system in which <em>computations</em> in category theory can be carried out in an efficient way. Specifically, I’m talking about <a href="https://github.com/olynch/Catlab.jl">Catlab.jl</a>. A discussion of Catlab.jl is also beyond the scope of this post, but I encourage you to check it out.</p>
<p>Therefore, I count Julia as a child of Haskell (or maybe, I count Catlab.jl as a child of Haskell) because the idea of organizing computation with category theory would not exist in the same way if it weren’t for Haskell.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>If I could talk to the Haskell-obsessed teenager that was me four years ago, I would tell him to keep his mind open. Haskell is still great for a lot of things (compilers come to mind), but if Haskell couldn’t inspire superior successors, there wouldn’t be worthwhile ideas in Haskell. There are those on the internet who are talking about how Haskell is dying, and they may or may not be wrong. Stephen Diehl, one of my main Haskell idols, is distancing himself from the Haskell community because of Haskell’s use as intellectual eye-candy on scam cryptocurrencies, and I think that there may be a tipping point where Haskell loses the zeitgeist of being exciting, and because it never had much of a foothold to begin with in industry, slips into irrelevance. But Haskell will always live on; it had a huge impact on many programmers and many languages disproportionate to its actual use, and it will always have a special place in my heart.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>We arrived at the last post about our <strong>Fault Injection</strong> research on the <strong>ESP32</strong>. Please read our previous posts as it provides context to the results described in this post.</p>

<li><a href="https://raelize.com/posts/espressif-systems-esp32-bypassing-flash-encryption/">Espressif ESP32: Bypassing Flash Encryption (CVE-2020-15048)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>During our <strong>Fault Injection</strong> research on the <strong>ESP32</strong>, we gradually took steps forward in order to identify the required vulnerabilities that allowed us to bypass <strong>Secure Boot</strong> and <strong>Flash Encryption</strong> with a single <strong>EM</strong> glitch. Moreover, we did not only achieve <strong>code execution</strong>, we also extracted the <strong>plain-text flash</strong> data from the chip.</p>
<p><strong>Espressif</strong> requested a <strong>CVE</strong>  for the attack described in this post: <a href="https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/advisory_downloads/Security%20Advisory%20CVE-2020-15048%2C%2013629%20EN%26CN.pdf" target="_blank">CVE-2020-13629</a>. Please note, that the attack as described in this post, is only applicable to <strong>ESP32</strong> silicon revision 0 and 1. The newer <strong>ESP32 V3</strong> silicon supports functionality to disable the <strong>UART bootloader</strong> that we leveraged for the attack.</p>

<p>The <strong>ESP32</strong> implements an <strong>UART bootloader</strong> in its <strong>ROM code</strong>. This feature allows, among other functionality, to program the external flash. It's not uncommon that such functionality is implemented in the <strong>ROM code</strong> as it's quite robust as the code cannot get corrupt easily. If this functionality would be implemented by code stored in the external flash, any corruption of the flash may result in a bricked device.</p>
<p>Typically, this type of functionality is accessed by booting the chip in a special <strong>boot mode</strong>. The <strong>boot mode</strong> selection is often done using one or more external strap pin(s) which are set before resetting the chip. On the <strong>ESP32</strong> it works exactly like this pin <code>G0</code> which is exposed externally.</p>
<p>The <strong>UART bootloader</strong> supports many interesting <a href="https://github.com/espressif/esptool/wiki/Serial-Protocol#command-opcodes" target="_blank">commands</a> that can be used to read/write memory, read/write registers and even execute a stub from <strong>SRAM</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="executing-arbitrary-code">Executing arbitrary code</h4>
<p>The <strong>UART bootloader</strong> supports loading and executing arbitrary code using the <code>load_ram</code> command. The <strong>ESP32</strong>'s SDK includes all the tooling required to compile the code that can be executed from <strong>SRAM</strong>. For example, the following code snippet will print <code>SRAM CODE\n</code> on the serial interface.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C"><span>void</span> <span>__attribute__</span><span>((</span><span>noreturn</span><span>))</span> <span>call_start_cpu0</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>ets_printf</span><span>(</span><span>"SRAM CODE</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>esptool.py</code> tool, which is part of the <strong>ESP32</strong>'s SDK, can be used to load the compiled binary into the <strong>SRAM</strong> after which it will be executed.</p>
<pre><code>esptool.py --chip esp32 --no-stub --port COM3 load_ram code.bin
</code></pre><p>Interestingly, the <strong>UART bootloader</strong> cannot disabled and therefore always accessible, even when <strong>Secure Boot</strong> and <strong>Flash Encryption</strong> are enabled.</p>
<h4 id="additional-measures">Additional measures</h4>
<p>Obviously, if no additional security measures would be taken, leaving the <strong>UART bootloader</strong> always accessible would render <strong>Secure Boot</strong> and <strong>Flash Encryption</strong> likely useless. Therefore, <strong>Espressif</strong> implemented additional security measures which are enabled using dedicated <strong>eFuses</strong>.</p>
<p>These are security configuration bits implemented in special memory, often referred to as <strong>OTP memory</strong>, which can typically only change from 0 to 1. This guarantees, that once enabled, is enabled forever. The following <strong>OTP memory</strong> bits are used to disable specific functionality when the <strong>ESP32</strong> is in the <strong>UART bootloader</strong> boot mode.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DISABLE_DL_ENCRYPT</strong>: disables flash encryption operation</li>
<li><strong>DISABLE_DL_DECRYPT</strong>: disables transparent flash decryption</li>
<li><strong>DISABLE_DL_CACHE</strong>: disables the entire MMU flash cache</li>
</ul>
<p>The most relevant <strong>OTP memory</strong> bit is <strong>DISABLE_DL_DECRYPT</strong> as it disables the transparent decryption of the flash data.</p>
<p>If not set, it would be possible to simply access the plain-text flash data while the <strong>ESP32</strong> is in its <strong>UART bootloader</strong> boot mode.</p>
<p>If set, any access to the flash, when the chip is in <strong>UART bootloader</strong> boot mode, will yield just the encrypted data. The <strong>Flash Encryption</strong> feature, which is fully implemented in hardware and transparent to the processor,  is only enabled in when the <strong>ESP32</strong> is in <strong>Normal</strong> boot mode.</p>
<p>The attacks described in this post have all these bits set to 1.</p>

<p>The <strong>SRAM</strong> memory that's used by the <strong>ESP32</strong> is typical technology that's used by many chips. It's commonly used to the <strong>ROM</strong>'s stack and executing the first bootloader from flash. It's convenient to use at early boot as it typically require no configuration before it can be used.</p>
<p>We know from previous experience that the data stored in <strong>SRAM</strong> memory is persistent until it's overwritten or the required power is removed from the physical cells. After a <strong>cold reset</strong> (i.e. power-cycle) of the chip, the <strong>SRAM</strong> will be reset to its default state. This often semi-random and unique per chip as the default value for each bit (i.e. 0 or 1) is different.</p>
<p>However, after a <strong>warm reset</strong>, where the entire chip is reset without removing the power, it may happen that the data stored in <strong>SRAM</strong> remains unaffected. This persistence of the data is visualized in the picture below.</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://raelize.com/img/esp32/esp32-sram-persistence.png">
        <img src="https://raelize.com/img/esp32/esp32-sram-persistence.png" width="700px">
    </a>
</p>
<p>We decided to figure out if this behavior holds up for the <strong>ESP32</strong> as well. We identified that the hardware <a href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/system/wdts.html" target="_blank">watchdog</a> can be used to issue a <strong>warm reset</strong> from software. This <strong>watchdog</strong> can also be issued when the chip is in <strong>UART bootloader</strong> boot mode and therefore we can use it to reset the <strong>ESP32</strong> back into <strong>Normal</strong> boot mode.</p>
<p>Using some test code, loaded and executed in <strong>SRAM</strong> using the <strong>UART bootloader</strong>, we determined that the data in <strong>SRAM</strong> is indeed persistent after issuing a <strong>warm reset</strong> using the <strong>watchdog</strong>. Effectively this means we can boot the <strong>ESP32</strong> in <strong>Normal</strong> boot mode with the <strong>SRAM</strong> filled with controlled data.</p>
<p>But… how can we (ab)use this?</p>

<p>We envisioned that we may be able to leverage the persistence of data in <strong>SRAM</strong> across <strong>warm resets</strong> for an attack. The first attack we came up with is to fill the <strong>SRAM</strong> with code using the <strong>UART bootloader</strong> and issue a <strong>warm reset</strong> using the <strong>watchdog</strong>. Then, we inject a glitch while the <strong>ROM code</strong> is overwriting this code with the <strong>flash bootloader</strong> during a normal boot.</p>
<p>We got this ideas as during our previous experiments, where we <a href="">turned data transfers into code execution</a>, we noticed that for some experiments the chip started executing from the entry address before the bootloader was finished copying.</p>
<p>Sometimes you just need to try it…</p>
<h4 id="attack-code">Attack code</h4>
<p>The code that we load into the <strong>SRAM</strong> using the <strong>UART bootloader</strong> is shown below.</p>

<li>Inject a glitch while the <strong>flash bootloader</strong> is being copied by the <strong>ROM code</strong></li>

<p>After running these experiments for more than a day, resulting in more than 1 million experiments, we did not observe any successful glitch…</p>

<p>
Lately we have been working on <a href="https://bytepack.io/">Bytepack</a> to help developers deliver and sell packages to companies and enterprises.</p>
<p>
In Bytepack, authors can push new packages at any time. Publishing said packages is done with your usual package manager tool, such as <code>mix hex.publish</code> in Elixir or <code>npm publish</code> for Node.js. Once you call these commands, the request goes to specific endpoints that implement the Hex.pm and npm APIs.</p>
<p>
The specific steps are shown in our “New package” page:</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://dashbit.co/images/posts/2020/bytepack-new-package.png" alt="ytepack new package screen"><br></p>
<p>
The <code>/packages/new</code> route is a <a href="https://phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix LiveView</a> that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>defmodule</span><span> </span><span>BytepackWeb.PackageLive.New</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="8580950847-1">do</span><span>

</span><span data-group-id="8580950847-1">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
Nothing special so far. But here is where LiveView is a big deal.</p>
<p>
To improve the user experience, we also wanted to automatically update the browser with the package information whenever the user publishes it. Implementing this functionality in LiveView requires three changes.</p>
<p>
First we broadcast an event whenever a package is created to a “package:new” topic under the user:</p>
<pre><code><span>Phoenix.PubSub</span><span>.</span><span>broadcast</span><span data-group-id="3903443770-1">(</span><span>
  </span><span>Bytepack.PubSub</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"user:</span><span data-group-id="3903443770-2">#{</span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span data-group-id="3903443770-2">}</span><span>:package:new"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="3903443770-3">{</span><span>:published</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>package</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span data-group-id="3903443770-3">}</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="3903443770-1">)</span></code></pre>
<p>
Back in <code>PackageLive.New</code>, we change <code>mount/3</code> to also subscribe to said topic:</p>
<pre><code><span>def</span><span> </span><span>mount</span><span data-group-id="1794271301-1">(</span><span>params</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>session</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>socket</span><span data-group-id="1794271301-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="1794271301-2">do</span><span>
  </span><span>socket</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>authenticate</span><span data-group-id="1794271301-3">(</span><span>socket</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>session</span><span data-group-id="1794271301-3">)</span><span>

  </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>connected?</span><span data-group-id="1794271301-4">(</span><span>socket</span><span data-group-id="1794271301-4">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="1794271301-5">do</span><span>
    </span><span>Phoenix.PubSub</span><span>.</span><span>subscribe</span><span data-group-id="1794271301-6">(</span><span>
      </span><span>Bytepack.PubSub</span><span>,</span><span>
      </span><span>"user:</span><span data-group-id="1794271301-7">#{</span><span>socket</span><span>.</span><span>assigns</span><span>.</span><span>current_user</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span data-group-id="1794271301-7">}</span><span>:package:new"</span><span>
    </span><span data-group-id="1794271301-6">)</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="1794271301-5">end</span><span>

  </span><span data-group-id="1794271301-8">{</span><span>:noreply</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>authenticate</span><span data-group-id="1794271301-9">(</span><span>socket</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>session</span><span data-group-id="1794271301-9">)</span><span data-group-id="1794271301-8">}</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="1794271301-2">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
and then write a clause to handle said events:</p>
<pre><code><span>def</span><span> </span><span>handle_info</span><span data-group-id="3117829849-1">(</span><span data-group-id="3117829849-2">{</span><span>:published</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>package_id</span><span data-group-id="3117829849-2">}</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>socket</span><span data-group-id="3117829849-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="3117829849-3">do</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="3117829849-4">{</span><span>:noreply</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>live_redirect</span><span data-group-id="3117829849-5">(</span><span>socket</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>to</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"/packages/</span><span data-group-id="3117829849-6">#{</span><span>package_id</span><span data-group-id="3117829849-6">}</span><span>"</span><span data-group-id="3117829849-5">)</span><span data-group-id="3117829849-4">}</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="3117829849-3">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
And that’s it! Now we redirect the browser to the newly created package page whenever the package is published.</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://dashbit.co/images/posts/2020/bytepack-new-package.gif" alt="ytepack new package screen"><br></p>
<p>
We didn’t have to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
manually establish WebSockets or long-polling connections  </li>
  <li>
create a separate endpoint to send requests to  </li>
  <li>
define a specific JSON payload between client/server  </li>
  <li>
write any front-end glue code  </li>
  <li>
setup third-party dependencies for pubsub, such as Redis, nor anything else to run at scale  </li>
  <li>
etc  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Compared to what <a href="https://phoenixphrenzy.com/">others have built with LiveView</a>, this is absolutely trivial. However, the fact we can set this up in less than 2 minutes is that excites me!</p>
<p>
LiveView comes with its own integrated testing story too. We can test everything from the comfort of Elixir, without a need to bring heavy-hitters such as Selenium or any webdriver.</p>
<p>
To run in development, we only need to start our Phoenix server. We don’t need external tooling in production either. We can deploy this to <a href="https://www.gigalixir.com/">Gigalixir</a>, <a href="https://gigalixir.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cluster.html">configure clustering</a>, and everything just works across multiple nodes.</p>
<p>
While this is a very limited sample of what LiveView can do, it highlights the beauty of its model and, perhaps more importantly, it shows all of the things we don’t have to manage nor worry about. At the end of the day, the Bytepack team can focus more on the user experience than we would otherwise, thanks to LiveView’s accessibility.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Twitter is a powerful <b>medium for sketching</b>: a tool for fluidly developing ideas in realtime. What can we learn from its design? I think it shows us the power of 1) the right constraints, 2) low barriers to starting and finishing, and 3) a social context.</p><div><figure>

<p>Writing is…hard. Like most aspiring bloggers, my folders of drafts and my dreams of future prolificness outweigh my actual output.</p>

<p>I’ve found a curious trick for getting over this hurdle, though: writing tweet threads. I’ve published many little bursts of tweets about topics I’m curious about:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt/status/1272542423001022467">connections between change in physical architecture and software</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt/status/1250443671020986368">pondering Airtable’s macro system</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt/status/1177607448682582016">the danger of “app-ifying” spreadsheets</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt/status/1258769298862100483">digging into the history of Applescript</a></li>
</ul>

<p>These are exactly the kinds of things I’d like to blog about! But somehow, I’ve found it 10 times easier to publish the tweet threads.</p>

<p>I can hear you groaning already. Of course tweeting is easier than writing, you dummy! Our minds are being driven into the meat grinder 280 characters at a time, as we replace deep logical thought with aphorisms and memes. Twitter is PowerPoint thinking on steroids.</p>

<p>But I think this dismissive response misses the point. We can’t really understand Twitter by treating it as a mediocre replacement for essays and research papers. We need to see it as a new medium on its own terms. In particular, <strong>Twitter is a medium for <em>sketching</em></strong>—for playing with ideas, on the fly. Twitter is more similar to scribbling on a whiteboard or tossing ideas around at the cafe than writing a book. (By sketching I don’t mean literally just drawing; I mean any lightweight early expression of a thought.)</p>

<p>Why does Twitter work so well for this? Here are some of my theories:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The right constraints</strong>: Good sketching tools provide the right limits on what you can do. Twitter’s constraints go beyond the obvious character count.</li>
<li><strong>Low barriers</strong>: Twitter makes it easy to get started. But, crucially, it also makes it easy to <em>finish</em>!</li>
<li><strong>A social context</strong>: Twitter provides a highly interconnected context for thinking. Should we be worried it takes it too far?</li>
</ul>

<p>By reflecting on these properties, I think we can gain some insight not just into Twiter specifically, but also the broader landscape of tools for thinking. Let’s dive in.</p>

<h2 id="the-right-constraints">The right constraints</h2>

<p>Thinking about big new things is hard, and our brains are good at finding ways to weasel out of the job by finding something easier to do, but still plausibly productive. Unfortunately, in the early stages of sketching out an idea, such distractions abound: worrying about word choice in the last paragraph instead of writing the next one, futzing with the font size, making a new blog system instead of writing the damn blog post.</p>

<p>We can try to avoid these temptations, but an easier route is to simply find tools that don’t allow have the temptations in the first place. <strong>This is a key property of good sketching tools: they provide the right constraints.</strong></p>

<h3 id="tiny-linear-atomic-outlines">Tiny, linear, atomic outlines</h3>

<p>Let’s examine a few of Twitter’s valuable constraints.</p>

<p>Start with the obvious one: <strong>the 280 character limit</strong>. Twitter’s main constraint is encouraging concision. It’s hard to dwell on word choice when you have so little space to work with. Twitter’s conversational tone also helps here—I can just <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/talk.html">write like I talk</a>, and any fancy words would seem out of place. And of course, I can’t tweak fonts and margins, which cuts off a distraction vector.</p>

<p>But threads complicate the story of character limits a bit. The limit isn’t really that your entire point must fit into one tweet—it’s that <strong><em>each</em> of your individual points must squeeze under the limit</strong>. This provides a different useful constraint: each idea has to be wrapped in a little atomic package. I find this helpful for figuring out the boundaries between my thoughts and clarifying the discrete units of an argument.</p>

<p>That constraint sort of resembles the benefits of an outlining tool. But Twitter has another constraint: <strong>a thread is linear</strong>! No indenting allowed. This forces a brisk straightline through the argument, instead of getting mired in the fine points of the sub-sub-sub-arguments of the first idea. Very limiting, but simultaneously freeing.</p>

<p>Taken together, these constraints frame the pros and cons of the medium, its appropriate range of usage. Obviously, writing a book in a single-level outline would be foolish, but it works for a rough sketch. More interestingly, I think Twitter is useless for persuading a skeptical reader; there’s simply not space for providing enough detail and context. This is a common property of media for sketching: the initial mockup isn’t impressive enough to sway a user, even if it’s a useful tool for the internal team. I prefer to use Twitter as a way to workshop ideas with sympathetic parties who already have enough context to share my excitement about the ideas.</p>

<p>Perhaps there’s a general principle here: Twitter is good for sketching ideas for the same reasons it’s bad for fully developing them. You can’t accidentally start writing a book in Twitter, and that’s kind of the point.</p>

<h3 id="the-puzzle-of-constraints">The puzzle of constraints</h3>

<p>In general, what are the <em>right</em> constraints for a sketching tool? I think this question is deeper than it seems at first glance.</p>

<p>You might say something like “only offer the minimum fidelity needed to convey the point,” but I think it’s not obvious how to define that minimum level. <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.3-chapter-04#fat-marker-sketches">Sketching with a fat marker</a> can prevent us from getting too detailed with our drawings; <a href="https://museapp.com/">Muse</a>, which I’ve been using for iPad sketching recently, intentionally limits your ink choices to just a few colors.</p>

<p>This works great for certain kinds of thinking and mockups. But for designing new interactions with animation and physics, we need <a href="http://notebook.maryrosecook.com/Prototypingtools.html">a totally different class of tools</a> with more capabilities! The line between essential and spurious depends on the goal.</p>

<p>Providing the right constraints isn’t always a matter of removing. It can require adding advanced capabiliites too, like this <a href="https://distill.pub/2017/aia/">typeface design tool</a> that uses fancy machine learning to provide a few simple knobs for controlling things like “bold.” It doesn’t let you move individual vector points, but instead lets you operate at a more natural level of abstraction.</p>

<p>If you’re not careful, constraints can easily damage fluidity—as <a href="http://gordonbrander.com/pattern/brick-pencil/">Engelbart showed</a>, tying a brick to a pencil does not yield a productive tool.</p>

<figure>

<figcaption>Surprise, surprise: writing with a “brick pencil” makes it harder to think big thoughts</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Overall, it seems that we want constraints that help keep us on track with fluid thought, but don’t rule out too many interesting possibilities. Considering both of these criteria together is a subtle balancing act, and I don’t see easy answers.</p>

<h2 id="low-barriers">Low barriers</h2>

<p>There’s a <strong>low barrier to starting</strong> on Twitter. Just click a button, type a thought, no need to spend a minute remembering how to start my blog server. Often, that first minute of friction is enough to prevent me from getting into the flow of writing.</p>

<p>But the more interesting phenomenon is the <strong>low barrier to finishing</strong>. On Twitter, a single sentence is a completely acceptable unit of publication. Anything beyond that is sort of a bonus. In contrast, most of my blog posts go unpublished because I fear they’re not complete, or not good enough in some dimension. These unpublished drafts are obviously far more complete than a single tweet, but because they’re on a blog, they don’t feel “done,” and it’s hard to overcome the fear of sharing.</p>

<p>This seems like a crucial part of sketching tools: when you make a sketch, it should be understood that your idea is immature, and feel safe to share it in that state. <strong>There’s a time and a place for polished, deeply thorough artifacts… and it’s not Twitter!</strong> Everyone knows you just did a quick sketch.</p>

<p>I believe that quantity leads to quality. <a href="https://kottke.org/09/02/art-and-fear">The students who make more pots in ceramics class improve faster than the students who obsess over making a single perfect pot</a>. A tool with a built-in low barrier to finishing makes it easier to overcome the fear, do more work, and share it at an earlier stage.</p>



<p>In my experience, sketching always requires a delicate dance between individual thought and collaboration. You sketch to clarify something for yourself, but also to communicate with others. I think a good sketching medium should account for both halves of the process.</p>

<p>Writing a blog can feel like a lonely one-way mirror: release something into the world, maybe get a few comments back and some Hacker News snark. In contrast, <strong>Twitter is a bazaar, buzzing with activity</strong>. The engagement ratio is totally different. You can easily have micro-conversations around individual points in a thread. When the same people start showing up time after time, it starts to feel like <a href="https://twitter.com/simonsarris/status/1270744181313503234">seeing acquaintances in a village</a>. On Twitter, I write for my Twitter friends, not for some amorphous crowd.</p>

<p>At its best, this engagement leads to the kind of back-and-forth that characterizes my favorite kinds of sketching sessions. Ideas are in the air, it’s not clear where they came from really, they combine to form new ones in realtime. For me, Twitter does an oddly good job at simulating the thrilling creative energy of a whiteboarding session. People pop in and out of the conversation offering insights; trees and sub-trees form riffing off of earlier points.</p>

<p>Of course, my feeling of safety here presumes healthy engagement from other parties, a privilege not enjoyed by all. I suppose it’s kind of odd that such a globally public medium is suitable at all for sketching—it seems only possible because I’ve found safe, trusting mini-communities, defined by informal and permeable boundaries. Perhaps a more private Twitter would be even better for sketching, although it might cut out new people from entering the conversation?</p>



<p>In an attempt to <em>sketch</em> more in the blog medium, I just whipped up this blog post in a couple hours, so I don’t really have a grand conclusion. And yet I’m still hitting …</p></div></div>

<![CDATA[Designing Up Banking]]>

September 22, 2020 | https://up.com.au/blog/the-evolutionary-design-of-up/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://up.com.au/blog/the-evolutionary-design-of-up/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>When we launched nearly 2 years ago, we declared our first principles approach to banking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Challenge the assumptions and limitations in banking and re-evaluate them from a more current point of view."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This statement did not come out of a contrived workshop, or committee, or a board of investors. It was the resonating sentiment of a team that had spent years in the weeds of banking software and its bureaucracy. Existing banks have too much baggage to be able to see the future of banking for what it could be. They lacked the courage to really re-invent themselves. Some questions that emerged from that period:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Why doesn’t every transaction have a timestamp, a merchant logo?</em></li>
<li><em>Why are all my payments to a particular person not grouped?</em></li>
<li><em>Why isn’t it easier to pay someone I’ve paid before?</em></li>
<li><em>Why am I sitting on hold on my phone to resolve an issue?</em></li>
<li><em>How can saving money be fun and engaging?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>We knew that if we followed our noses and solved these user-centric problems, and many others of course, that winning customers would take care of itself. We now have over 280,000 Upsiders and counting.</p>
<h2>Making Feedback Easy</h2>
<p>Up does not do traditional user testing. There, I said it. That’s our dirty secret.</p>
<p>We think there are other techniques that are faster and better indicators of real-world behaviour. We also believe we have two advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>An innovation mindset</strong></li>
<li><strong>A deeper relationship with our customers than any financial institution in Australia</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Much of banking is a known problem space. We feel like we're taking a more creative approach to the problem, but that's not to say we don't rely on user feedback. Our <em>Talk to Us</em> section encourages Upsiders to give us feedback or suggest ideas. To date, we have received over 6,000 ideas via this channel, making it one of the most crucial conduits into the minds of our customers. We also have other highly-engaged channels such as our socials and the newsletter where we hear, almost instantly, what customers think of what we’ve delivered.</p>

<h2>Engagement Is the Name of the Game</h2>
<p>So where do we get our inspiration? It's rarely in the banking or fintech space. These are the apps that exist on billions of devices and set the bar for mobile digital experiences:</p>

<p>While they vary in purpose, their collective dominance in the landscape means they teach and familiarise patterns to expect when using our phones.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>How does TikTok allow you to react to content quickly and effortlessly?</em></li>
<li><em>What similarities are there between Whatsapp, Messenger and Instagram when conversing with friends?</em></li>
<li><em>When explaining new features what language do these platforms use? When do they use visualisations? When do they use words?</em></li>
<li><em>When is Snapchat playful and when is it serious?</em></li>
<li><em>Do I identify with my real name or username for Instagram? What about Facebook?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>As users we immerse ourselves in the apps that have nailed engagement. While acknowledging the patterns they establish, we also appreciate the balance between knowing when to follow them and when to do our own thing. Up has a handful of atypical patterns, but as long as they are usable and intuitive they can become distinct moments used to engage and delight.</p>
<p>Why is it so important that Upsiders engage with the Up app? Aside from the opportunity to nurture a relationship through frequent interactions, we also think that being more engaged with your money encourages better financial literacy. It’s common that people fall into credit trouble by continuing to use their plastic cards without checking their balance regularly. By making Up an engaging experience, we’re making Upsiders more confident and connected to their finances.</p>
<h2>Becoming an Upsider</h2>
<p>We’ve previously deep-dived on our <a href="https://up.com.au/blog/designing-a-super-powered-welcome-pack-experience/">card delivery experience</a>. Before we could even get that far, we had to solve the huge problem of enabling people to sign up for a bank account without leaving the comfort of a mobile app — something that had not been done before in Australia.</p>
<p>We knew that the sheer amount of information we needed from the user was going to be a challenge. Banking is highly regulated in Australia, so we had to cater for many types of identity data (passport, license etc). Most apps can get away with just asking for a username, email and password.</p>
<p>Mobile flows tend to be atomic with a single input per screen, so with identity verification we were anticipating quite a long flow. Our focus was to trim the fat wherever possible, not just by reducing the total number of screens but also by making it easy for people to understand what was being asked of them as they progressed.</p>

<p>We fought to reduce the amount of data we needed to collect. Why does banking need to know your gender? We cut it. Do you need your card sent to a PO Box? We’ll give you a contextual experience based on answers you’ve already provided rather than a scrolling form full of fields. As we tested the new flow amongst ourselves and with beta users from our waitlist, we made a few changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anchoring buttons to the bottom of the viewport, and making them full-width. Close to your thumb and easy to hit.</li>
<li>Removing anything extra like images, so you could move faster without distractions.</li>
<li>Using conversational instructions (eg “What is your mobile number?” Instead of “Enter mobile number”). And only using secondary body text when it was really necessary.</li>
<li>Using example text for the input placeholder, so you'd know what the right info looks like.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these small iterations reduced the cognitive load for users and made it feel easy and fast, despite the number of screens. This granularity was important as there isn’t actually a single sign up flow, but several which vary depending on your circumstances and the information we are required to collect.</p>
<h2>Up Yeah!</h2>
<p>Once we became more confident in our onboarding flow and how streamlined it was becoming, you could feel the team were ready to ship it and move onto the next bit of work.</p>
<p>It’s easy to have the blinkers on when you have such a measurable and objective goal — get users into the app in under x time — but stepping back, we made the observation that although we’d nailed sign up speed, something was missing the first time you landed on your activity feed. A moment that should feel significant and celebratory — you’ve literally just opened a bank account in under 3 minutes through your phone — feels clinical and unimpressive. We appreciate great brand moments in digital experiences, most notably MailChimp’s use of emotive design throughout their email software.</p>

<p>Email campaigns are stressful exercises — you can’t unsend them once they go out. It’s the nature of the beast. Interestingly, it was the arm of their mascot beast Freddie that was used in these cute but situationally-aware animations. The red button before launch, the high five once your campaign is live, and the rock fist for scheduled campaigns.</p>
<p>Our creative director Pete was eager to create a moment post-signup that made you go “f*ck yeah” in celebration.</p>

</figure>
<p>Almost immediately after this launched it was being shared by new Upsiders and acknowledged through our feedback channels. Of course you only give yourself an opportunity for these moments if you are nailing the fundamentals. But this reinforcement encouraged us to lean into these seemingly frivolous treatments as a way to delight Upsiders while building a stronger brand.</p>
<h2>Logging in Sucks</h2>
<p>Sometimes the design process involves considering what you don’t see as much as what you do see. For Up, removing the login screen is a great example of this. Banking apps tend to have heavy authentication flows before you see your feed or landing screen. It’s easy to see how this came to be; mobile apps came after desktop banking sites, and so inherited their secure lockdown context. And perhaps it goes back even further back to the mindset of “money belongs in a vault, behind a locked door”.</p>
<p>With all the technological advances in mobile device security, from the humble PIN code to sophisticated biometric recognition, it’s worth questioning some of the assumptions and trade-offs made in the name of security.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Logging in is a big friction point. Especially if we’re trying to help inform you about your finances.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s an interesting distinction that’s prominent in tech — the difference between security and privacy. If we break out of the world of banking apps and look at some of the apps we use each and every day – imagine if you had to enter a passcode every time you opened your email, or your messages? Yet if someone had access to either, they could reset every password you have and really cause you some headaches. We found a helpful albeit simplified distinction when approaching this aspect of the user-experience:</p>
<br>
<table>
    <tbody><tr>
        <td><img loading="lazy" src="https://up.com.au/251bbe56c807fe4657239958a04f14e6/zap-coat.gif" alt="Mailchimp animations">
        </td>
        <td>
          <h3>Privacy</h3>
          Protecting information that is sensitive
          <em> "Read Only"</em>
        </td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>
<table>
    <tbody><tr>
        <td><img loading="lazy" src="https://up.com.au/6e9f440aae0b397bd198cc1182838ed9/zap-lock.gif" alt="Mailchimp animations">
        </td>
        <td>
          <h3>Security</h3>
          Protecting against being compromised financially
          <em>"Write Access"</em>
        </td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>A design decision we’ve made with this framework is removing the need to enter a passcode by default (which can be re-enabled in settings), and also when moving money where there isn’t any risk. Transfering between Savers doesn’t require you to use your phone’s authentication flow (e.g. passcode, Apple’s FaceID or Android’s BioAuth), but moving money into your spending account or sending money outside of your account (e.g. to another bank or via BPay) does.</p>
<p>Our philosophy is to ask for authentication where appropriate to maximise security, while also letting Upsiders enjoy the benefits of being more informed and connected with their money in a low-friction way.  Our push …</p></section></div></div>

<p><a name="p2"></a>“Two large dark-coloured eyes were regarding me steadfastly. 
  The mass that framed them, the head of the thing, it was rounded, and had, one 
  might say, a face. There was a mouth under the eyes, the lipless brim of which 
  quivered and panted, and dropped saliva. The whole creature heaved and pulsated 
  convulsively. A lank tentacular appendage gripped the edge of the cylinder, 
  another swayed in the air. ... There was something fungoid in the oily brown 
  skin, something in the clumsy deliberation of the tedious movements unspeakably 
  nasty.”<br>
  <span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>– H.G. Wells, <em>The War of 
  the Worlds</em> (1898) 
</p>
<p> <a name="p3"></a>Pretty disgusting, huh? The classic tales of science fiction 
  are full of Bug-Eyed Monsters (or BEMs as they are affectionately termed by 
  cognoscenti) which invade planets, threaten towns. attack rocket ships, and 
  carry off shapely human females. Hollywood producers apparently are convinced 
  most extraterrestrial (ET) beings fall in one of four zoological categories: 
  (1) Human or humanoid, (2) oversized animals, (3) amorphous blobs and pods, 
  and (4) formless energy beings.</p>
<p><a name="p4"></a>Can’t we do any better than this?</p>
<p><a name="p5"></a>Quite! In fact. anyone with access to a good library can walk 
  in and read all about the biology of one of the most fascinating, richly populated 
  worlds anywhere in the Milky Way: Earth! We inhabit a queer planet with many 
  strange settings and fabulous living creatures, altogether an excellent example 
  of what extraterrestrial life may be all about. To a team of Interstellar Zoologists, 
  researching sentient terrestrial mammals out here in the galactic boondocks, 
  our world is as rare a planetary zoo as any in the Milky Way.</p>
<p><a name="p6"></a><a href="http://www.xenology.info/Xeno.htm#PartTwo">Xenobiologists</a> 
  have formulated a simple rule called the Assumption of Mediocrity, which says, 
  in essence, that Earth should be regarded as “typically exotic.” 
  The unusual solutions devised by evolution on this planet to cope with the problem 
  of survival will find their parallels, though not necessarily their duplicates, 
  among the living species of other worlds. As biologist Allen Broms once remarked, 
  “life elsewhere is likely to consist of odd combinations of familiar bits.”</p>

<p> <strong><a name="p7"></a>Strange Life</strong></p>
<p><a name="p8"></a>Life as we know it is based on cells: small, neat packages 
  of living protoplasm containing all of the biological machinery necessary for 
  survival. Human body cells average a few microns in size. (One micron is a millionth 
  of a meter, about a hundredth of the thickness of the page these words are printed 
  on.) The smallest living thing on Earth capable of independent metabolic activity 
  is the PPLO, or “pleuropneumonia-like organism,” which measures 
  0.1 microns. Microbiologists estimate that the smallest cell that could, in 
  theory, exist would measure about 0.04 microns in diameter. It is amusing to 
  speculate that the alien analogue to a human being, constructed in the same 
  form but using these miniature cells, would weigh a mere 50 milligrams and stand 
  only 5 millimeters tall – hardly the thickness of a pencil. Whether creatures 
  so small could retain a human-level intelligence is anyone’s guess.</p>
<p><a name="p9"></a>Fairly large extraterrestrial lifeforms might well exhibit 
  acellular physiology, or be unicellular. For example, at one stage in their 
  life history, slime molds are tiny one-celled flagellates capable of individual 
  multiplication by simple fission. In the later “plasmodium” stage 
  of development, large clumps of these creatures fuse together and their cell 
  walls dissolve away to produce an amorphous acellular mass of living protoplasm 
  which can grown as large as 25 centimeters or more. Further, the largest known 
  single living cell was the egg of the now-extinct half-ton elephant bird or 
  “roc bird” (<em>Aepyornis maximus</em>). This egg measured about 
  a third of a meter across and weighed 15 kilograms.</p>
<p><a name="p10"></a>The number and kinds of organs in alien creatures may also 
  be highly variable. For example, earthly squids have two different kinds of 
  hearts – one for venous and a separate one for arterial blood – 
  and the common earthworm (<em>Pheretima</em>) has a dozen hearts. Two extinct 
  dinosaur species, <em>Brontosaurus</em> and <em>Diplodocus</em>, had two brains, 
  one in the head and an even larger hunk of neural tissue in the hip region. 
  (The volume of this “sacral enlargement” in <em>Stegosaurus</em>, 
  another fossil animal of grand proportions, was perhaps twenty times larger 
  than the brain in the cranial cavity! And the entire body of an insect is its 
  “lung” – oxygen is carried directly to cells by an intricate 
  network of tracheae or microtubules permeating the entire organism.</p>
<p><a name="p11"></a>Sometimes, organs combine several functions in one – 
  such as the human mouth. ETs need not have the same combinations as we. They 
  may have identical or separate organs for eating, drinking, excreting, breathing, 
  and speaking. The dolphin, for instance. eats through its mouth, breathes through 
  its blowhole, and “speaks” through its “ears.” The land 
  snail’s lung opens into a passageway other than its food canal, and sea 
  cucumbers breathe through their rectums (called “anal respiration”). 
  The cloacae of frogs and many other animals is a single organ which combines 
  excretory and reproduction functions. Brachiopods can only vomit excrement from 
  their “blind intestine” (a kind of alimentary cul-de-sac), and the 
  members of phylum <em>Nematomorpha</em> (long worms) eat solely by direct absorption 
  of nutrients through the skin – for they have no mouths.</p>

<p> <strong><a name="p12"></a>How Large?</strong></p>
<p><a name="p13"></a>How big can ETs be? To answer the question we need to understand 
  something called the Square-Cube Law. This universal geometrical principle, 
  first recognized by Galileo more than three centuries ago, holds that volume 
  always increases faster than surface area as size increases. A solid cubical 
  box whose edge is doubled increases in surface area by a factor of two squared 
  (2x2), or four; whereas volume, hence mass, increases by two cubed (2x2x2), 
  or eight.</p>
<p><a name="p14"></a>It’s easy to apply this to biology. Picture a bony 
  extraterrestrial herbivore placidly grazing in some alien meadow. Suddenly we 
  double its size all over. The animal’s leg bones, now twice as thick, 
  have quadrupled in cross-sectional area; but the creature weighs eight times 
  as much so its bones must sustain double the pressure. It may collapse under 
  normal exertion unless it grows proportionally stouter limbs to handle the added 
  physical stress.</p>
<p><a name="p15"></a>All parts of an animal must be reengineered when size increases. 
  Like bone, muscle strength is determined by cross-sectional area. Humanoids 
  twice as large need quadruply thick biceps: otherwise they’d be pulling 
  eight times the mass with only four times the force. Lungs, kidneys, intestines 
  and other blood filtering organs function according to surface area, so must 
  either increase in mass or become more convoluted at larger body sizes.</p>
<p><a name="p16"></a>The horror movies about giant insects ravaging the countryside 
  are really quite impossible, even on low-gravity worlds. A bug as large as a 
  house would weigh a billion times more than its flea-sized Earthly cousins. 
  Its thin spindly legs would be called upon to sustain stresses thousands of 
  times greater. To walk at all the overgrown arthropod needs muscles proportionally 
  thousands of times thicker; unfortunately, vital tissues already fill the hollow 
  skeleton of the tiny original. It did not collapse under its own weight or was 
  not immobilized by the feebleness of its muscles, an overgrown insect would 
  starve to death because its stomach would be a thousandfold too small to absorb 
  enough food; or it would suffocate because its tracheae could carry only a thousandth 
  as much air as needed.</p>
<p><a name="p17"></a>Sea creatures are free of gravity at neutral buoyancy, but 
  still they’re dogged by the Square-Cube Law. Bodies in motion like to 
  continue in motion – extraterrestrial leviathans larger than whales would 
  experience serious steering, turning and braking difficulties because of their 
  relatively great mass compared to the area of their control surfaces. Cornering 
  too fast might cause stresses in excess of the tensile strength of biological 
  materials and the behemoth would literally snap in two. These problems are familiar 
  to pilots of modem supertankers, huge ships requiring kilometers to turn or 
  stop.</p>

<p> <strong><a name="p18"></a>Gravity and Life</strong></p>
<p><a name="p19"></a>The respected zoologist D’Arcy Wentworth Thompson once 
  speculated about the <a href="http://www.xenology.info/Xeno/11.2.1.htm">effects 
  of gravity on evolution</a>. “Were the force of gravity to be doubled,” 
  Thompson declared, “our bipedal form would be a failure, and the majority 
  of terrestrial animals would resemble short-legged saurians, or else serpents. 
  Birds and insects would suffer likewise, though with some compensation in the 
  increased density of the air. On the other hand, if gravity were halved, we 
  should get a lighter, slenderer, more active type, needing less energy, less 
  heat, less heart, less lungs, less blood. Gravity not only controls the actions 
  but also influences the forms of all save the least of organisms.”</p>
<p><a name="p20"></a>It is true that the maximum weight of living species cannot 
  exceed the crushing strength of bony material. But animals are not designed 
  to stand still – if they were, human legs could be a few millimeters thick. 
  Instead they must bear up under the peak pressures and accelerations encountered 
  during normal running, jumping, and other strenuous survival activities. A horse 
  at rest seems greatly overbuilt; on the racetrack where it may pull to a halt

September 21, 2020 | https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/2020/09/rb3011-mainline.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/2020/09/rb3011-mainline.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>I upgraded my home internet connection to fibre (FTTP) <a href="https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/2019/10/native-ipv6-fttp.html">last October</a>. I’m still on an 80M/20M service, so it’s no faster than my old VDSL FTTC connection was, and as a result for a long time I continued to use my HomeHub 5A running <a href="https://openwrt.org/">OpenWRT</a>. However the FTTP ONT meant I was using up an additional ethernet port on the router, and I was already short, so I ended up with a GigE switch in use as well. Also my wifi is handled by a <a href="https://unifi-network.ui.com/">UniFi</a>, which takes its power via Power-over-Ethernet. That mean I had a router, a switch and a PoE injector all in close proximity. I wanted to reduce the number of devices, and ideally upgrade to something that could scale once I decide to upgrade my FTTP service speed.</p>

<p>Looking around I found the <a href="https://mikrotik.com/product/RB3011UiAS-RM">MikroTik RB3011UiAS-RM</a>, which is a rack mountable device with 10 GigE ports (plus an SFP slot) and a dual core <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/ipq8064">Qualcomm IPQ8064</a> ARM powering it. There’s 1G RAM and 128MB NAND flash, as well as a USB3 port. It also has PoE support. On paper it seemed like an ideal device. I wasn’t particularly interested in running RouterOS on it (the provided software), but that’s based on Linux and there was some work going on within OpenWRT to add support, so it seemed like a worthwhile platform to experiment with (what, you expected this to be about me buying an off the shelf device and using it with only the supplied software?). As an added bonus a friend said he had one he wasn’t using, and was happy to sell it to me for a bargain price.</p>

<p><img alt="RB3011 router in use" src="https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/images/2020/rb3011.jpg"></p>

<p>I did try out RouterOS to start with, but I didn’t find it particularly compelling. I’m comfortable configuring firewalling and routing at a Linux command line, and I run some additional services on the router like my <a href="https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/2018/05/mqtt-broker.html">MQTT</a> broker, and <a href="https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/2018/09/netlink-arp-presence.html">mqtt-arp</a>, my wifi device presence monitor. I could move things around such that they ran on the <a href="https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/2019/07/upgrading-the-house-server.html">house server</a>, but I consider them core services and as a result am happier with them on the router.</p>

<p>The first step was to get something booting on the router. Luckily it has an RJ45 serial console port on the back, and a reasonably featured bootloader that can manage to boot via tftp over the network. It wants an ELF binary rather than a plain kernel, but Sergey Sergeev had done the hard work of getting <a href="https://github.com/adron-s/uboot-ipq806x">u-boot working for the IPQ8064</a>, which mean I could just build normal u-boot images to try out.</p>

<p>Linux upstream already had basic support for a lot of the pieces I was interested in. There’s a slight fudge around <code>AUTO_ZRELADDR</code> because the network coprocessors want a chunk of memory at the start of RAM, but there’s ongoing discussions about how to handle this cleanly that I’m hopeful will eventually mean I can drop that hack. Serial, ethernet, the QCA8337 switches (2 sets of 5 ports, tied to different GigE devices on the processor) and the internal NOR all had drivers, so it was a matter of crafting an appropriate DTB to get them working. That left niggles.</p>

<p>First, the second switch is hooked up via SGMII. It turned out the IPQ806x <code>stmmac</code> driver didn’t initialise the clocks in this mode correctly, and neither did the <code>qca8k</code> switch driver. So I need to fix up both of those (Sergey had handled the stmmac driver, so I just had to clean up and submit his patch). Next it turned out the driver for talking to the Qualcomm firmware (SCM) had been updated in a way that broke the old method needed on the IPQ8064. Some git archaeology figured that one out and provided a solution. Ansuel Smith helpfully provided the DWC3 PHY driver for the USB port. That got me to the point I could put a Debian armhf image onto a USB stick and mount that as root, which made debugging much easier.</p>

<p>At this point I started to play with configuring up the device to actually act as a router. I make use of a number of VLANs on my home network, so I wanted to make sure I could support those. Turned out the stmmac driver wasn’t happy reconfiguring its MTU because the IPQ8064 driver doesn’t configure the FIFO sizes. I found what seem to be the correct values and plumbed them in. Then the <code>qca8k</code> driver only supported port bridging. I wanted the ability to have a trunk port to connect to the upstairs switch, while also having ports that only had a single VLAN for local devices. And I wanted the switch to handle this rather than requiring the CPU to bridge the traffic. Thankfully it’s easy to find a copy of the QCA8337 datasheet and the kernel <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/dsa/index.html">Distributed Switch Architecture</a> is pretty flexible, so I was able to implement the necessary support.</p>

<p>I stuck with Debian on the USB stick for actually putting the device into production. It makes it easier to fix things up if necessary, and the USB stick allows for a full Debian install which would be tricky on the 128M of internal NAND. That means I can use things like <a href="https://wiki.nftables.org/">nftables</a> for my firewalling, and use the standard Debian packages for things like <a href="https://collectd.org/">collectd</a> and <a href="https://mosquitto.org/">mosquitto</a>. Plus for debug I can fire up things like tcpdump or tshark. Which ended up being useful because when I put the device into production I started having weird IPv6 issues that turned out to be a lack of proper Ethernet multicast filter support in the IPQ806x ethernet device. The driver would try and setup the multicast filter for the IPv6 NDP related packets, but it wouldn’t actually work. The fix was to fall back to just receiving all multicast packets - this is what the vendor driver does.</p>

<p>Most of this work will be present once the 5.9 kernel is released - the basics are already in 5.8. Currently not queued up that I can think of are the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>stmmac IPQ806x FIFO sizes. I sent out an RFC patch for these, but didn’t get any replies. I probably just need to submit this.</li>
  <li>NAND. This is missing support for the QCOM ADM DMA engine. I’ve sent out the patch I found to enable this, and have had some feedback, so I’m hopeful it will get in at some point.</li>
  <li>LCD. AFAICT LCD is an ST7735 device, which has kernel support, but I haven’t spent serious effort getting the SPI configuration to work.</li>
  <li>Touchscreen. Again, this seems to be a zt2046q or similar, which has a kernel driver, but the basic attempts I’ve tried don’t get any response.</li>
  <li>Proper SFP functionality. The IPQ806x has a PCS module, but the stmmac driver doesn’t have an easy way to plumb this in. I have ideas about how to get it working properly (and it can be hacked up with a fixed link config) but it’s not been a high priority.</li>
  <li>Device tree additions. Some of the later bits I’ve enabled aren’t yet in the mainline RB3011 DTB. I’ll submit a patch for that at some point.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall I consider the device a success, and it’s been entertaining getting it working properly. I’m running a mostly mainline kernel, it’s handling my house traffic without breaking a sweat, and the fact it’s running Debian makes it nice and easy to throw more things on it as I desire. However it turned out the RB3011 isn’t as perfect device as I’d hoped. The PoE support is passive, and the UniFi wants 802.1af. So I was going to end up with 2 devices. As it happened I picked up a cheap <a href="https://eu.dlink.com/uk/en/products/dgs-1210-series-gigabit-smart-plus-switches">D-Link DGS-1210-10P</a> switch, which provides the PoE support as well as some additional switch ports. Plus it runs Linux, so more on that later…</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://www.naut.ca/blog/content/images/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-05-at-3.30.56-PM.jpeg" width="400px/"></p><p>Just yesterday, I turned off iCloud on <strong>all</strong> my Apple devices. I then took a moment to savour my liberation from Apple's walled garden.</p>
<p>It has been over two years since I first dabbled in hosting my own blog server to finally disabling my iCloud account. There is a good reason as to why it took so long. Apple has cultivated a beautiful hardware+software ecosystem over the years, resulting in an ecosystem filled with magical features such as Apple Pay, Home Sharing, Handoff, and Instant Hotspot. An iCloud account is apparently a requirement for all of those features, which is a shame. I didn't find out until after I logged out and lost those features, but maybe it was for the better. Anyway, here's the proof:<br>
<img src="https://www.naut.ca/blog/content/images/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-05-at-3.38.39-PM.jpeg" alt="Screen-Shot-2020-05-05-at-3.38.39-PM"><br>
Now this may sound odd, but I feel that the fallbacks and replacements to iCloud features are sometimes easier to understand and give more of a feeling of groundedness, albeit at the cost of convenience. For example, I no longer debate about whether to use Apple Pay or not, and I feel grounded knowing that the physical card is all I need to protect, and that my credit card won't run out of battery. I now plug in a cable to backup my iPhone, and I hear the hard disks on my server grinding away as the files are transferred. I'm confident that something, if anything, is happening. By physically self-hosting emails in the house, I feel secure that a company can't tell me that my account has vanished, a concept that is becoming <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23057365">increasingly common</a>.</p>
<p>As we switched from using physical devices such as floppy disks, CDs, and servers to storing data and logic online, we lost a sense of physicality and tangibility, replaced by an abstract notion of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GRPArTor7w">cloud</a>. Most programmers realize that the cloud is not a magical place and are comfortable with the notion, but I've noticed that the cloud instills fear, uncertainty, and doubt in others.</p>
<p>Given that I've been to hell and back setting up a self-hosted cloud (even my programmer friends stare at me quizzically), I sound crazy to mention that this has made things "easier". I'm definitely <strong>not</strong> saying that self-hosting is easier than using iCloud, but it has made me aware of what we are missing. In any interactive system, the true complexity must hide somewhere, and in this case, Apple is offering to manage it for you. In an attempt for trust, security, and ease of use, these services create a greater disconnect between you and your "interactee". To give an example, take transactions between you and a merchant. First there was bartering. Then there was cash. These are both easy to understand, and almost nobody has trouble understanding the end-to-end concepts. However, take Apple Pay. Here's a high-level example of what it actually does:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>NFC Coil in POS Terminal energizes iPhone antenna ⟶ sends data to NFC Chip ⟶ activates iPhone CPU ⟶ requests Face ID unlock ⟶ beams tiny Infrared dots at your face ⟶ Infrared Camera constructs 3D model using Machine Learning model ⟶ decrypts credit card details in Secure Enclave ⟶ creates credit card token ⟶ sends back to iPhone NFC chip ⟶ transmits to POS Terminal ⟶ encrypts with TLS ⟶ sends through internet to the credit card network ⟶ network replies back</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To reiterate, this is a <em>high-level</em> overview. So yeah, try feeling grounded with that. It's a miracle that it even works.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Overall, my self-hosting series has reduced the FUD surrounding these services for <em>me</em> (and hopefully at least another reader), since I now understand how the software works. I feel it is an accomplishment to be disconnected from Apple, knowing that I'm free to switch hardware whenever I please. Although increased privacy was one of the main reasons I started this series, I haven't really noticed anything different day-to-day. This series has been a very interesting journey, and it will be something that I will continue to explore with future blog posts. As somebody who is now examining iCloud from an outsider perspective for the first time, it is mind-boggling the amount of complexity that Apple manages and exerts power over, such as their COVID-19 Contact Tracing technology. I wonder what the future holds for Apple, and how its values will change over time.</p>

<p>Over the past years, I’ve worked in multiple teams adopting very different strategies when it comes to feature flags. I’ve seen the pros and cons of both, and over time, I found myself disagreeing with any fundamentalist position on their use. There is a lot of nuance to this topic, and I think it is worth considering more carefully the various scenarios where feature flags do and do not make sense.</p>



<h2>The Reasons For</h2>



<p>There are a few major scenarios where feature flags make a lot of sense. The first is when it’s used for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="A/B testing (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing" target="_blank">A/B testing</a>, where you absolutely do want different behaviors for different users, based on their randomly assigned treatment. I’ve seen this strategy employed extremely well at Amazon where new features are gated by a “feature flag” that is actually controlled by an internal A/B testing framework. The framework randomly exposes some Amazon customers to the new feature, and then monitors their subsequent behavior in order to estimate the business impact of launching the feature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was initially skeptical, but was soon won over by how easy the framework was to use, and the valuable insights it provided on the benefits (or drawbacks) of certain features. “Flavor of the month” decisions were replaced with real data. And none of this is possible without the use of “feature flags” to dynamically toggle new features.</p>



<hr>



<p>Another great use case for feature flags, is when you’re working on a very complex epic that require many different sub-tasks to be completed in different parts of the system. Sub-tasks that are too numerous and invasive to be done in a single pull-request. </p>



<p>In such cases, trying to keep all these disparate changes in side-branches and coordinating a simultaneous merge and deployment, is a recipe for disaster. It’s far more manageable to gate any disruptive changes behind a master flag, merge and deploy all the sub-commits incrementally, and do a flag-flip once all the pieces are in place.</p>



<hr>



<p>One last use case for feature flags, is when you do not have control over your deployments. For example, consider the Facebook Android app, which contains code contributed by hundreds of different teams, all combined and deployed as a single binary. In such scenarios, performing rollbacks can be infeasible. For practical, political, bureaucratic or even marketing reasons. In such cases, feature flags allow your team to toggle new functionality or mitigate risky changes, without having to rollback or deploy any new binaries.</p>



<p><em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/i5zbvk/when_feature_flags_do_and_dont_make_sense/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Someone on Reddit pointed out</a> a similar use-case for feature flags: targeting a very specific launch date for marketing reasons, while still deploying your code much earlier, in order to ensure stability. You can then have a “dynamic” feature flag that automatically enables itself at a specific time. This is also a great use-case for similar reasons – changing functionality in situations where deploying a new binary is impractical.</em></p>



<h2>Risk Aversion</h2>



<p>The above are all fantastic use cases for feature flags, but I’ve also seen teams get bogged down by policies that overreach in their use. For example, mandating that every single code change should be behind a feature flag, <em>“just in case we made a mistake”</em>.</p>



<p>Risk management should indeed be a priority for all teams. But there are better ways of doing this than relying on feature flags, especially if your team has control over its own deployments. The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://software.rajivprab.com/2019/04/28/rethinking-software-testing-perspectives-from-the-world-of-hardware/" target="_blank">vast majority of your bugs should be caught by your automated test suite</a> and/or QA process. And the last few stragglers should be handled using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="incremental deployments, production alarms and rollbacks (opens in a new tab)" href="https://software.rajivprab.com/2019/11/25/the-birth-of-legacy-software-how-change-aversion-feeds-on-itself/" target="_blank">incremental deployments, production alarms and rollbacks</a>.</p>



<p>Besides, as soon as any problem is detected, the recommendation at places like Google is to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="rollback first and ask questions later (opens in a new tab)" href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/reliable-releases-and-rollbacks-cre-life-lessons" target="_blank">rollback first and investigate the problem later</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>We have seen this at Google any number of times, where a hastily deployed roll-forward fix either fails to fix the original problem, or indeed makes things worse. Even if it fixes the problem it may then uncover other latent bugs in the system; you’re taking yourself further from a known-good state, into the wilds of a release that hasn’t been subject to the regular strenuous QA testing. At Google, our philosophy is that “rollbacks are normal.” When an error is found or reasonably suspected in a new release, the releasing team rolls back first and investigates the problem second</em></p></blockquote>



<p> When things are on fire, the last thing you want to do is root-cause the bug and figure out which flag-flip will safely fix the problem. And that may not even fix things – there’s no guarantee that even if your teammate tried to put his changes behind a feature flag, he didn’t inadvertently introduce a bug that cannot be solved by a flag-flip.</p>



<p>Feature flags are a poor man’s alternative to binary rollbacks, and they definitely aren’t a substitute for having a great automated test suite and a robust QA process. If you’re relying on feature flags to remedy production bugs, you should stop and evaluate your team’s practices. Risk aversion is often a smell of your team <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="entering into a doom loop which will only get worse and worse with time (opens in a new tab)" href="https://software.rajivprab.com/2019/11/25/the-birth-of-legacy-software-how-change-aversion-feeds-on-itself/" target="_blank">entering into a doom loop which will only get worse and worse with time</a>.</p>



<h2>Death By Feature Flags</h2>



<p>You may be wondering at this point why we shouldn’t use feature flags anyway. After all, <em>“defense in depth” …</em> and it never hurts to have more fine-grain flexibility right?</p>



<p>While feature flags are great in some cases, we should also keep in mind their costs. Software engineering is primarily an exercise in managing complexity. And each feature flag immediately doubles the universe of corner cases that your programmers have to understand, and your code is required to handle. <em>“But what would happen if Foo is enabled, Bar is disabled, and we do independent A/B tests on Baz and Kaz on the same day?”</em> In my experience, this combinatorial explosion in complexity can and <strong>will</strong> lead to bugs. Not to mention slowing down the speed at which your team can make any changes.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24549917" target="_blank">To quote an amusing anecdote shared online</a>: <em>“A flag that hasn’t been set to off in a year can be masking a major regression. At my last job we had two major outages in as many years from defunct flags defaulting to ‘off’ when the feature flag system failed to return flag states.”</em></p>



<p><em>“But these feature flags are only temporary. You should be removing them as soon as possible!”</em></p>



<p>Sure, and we should also not allow our tech debt to accumulate and we should follow every single best-practice religiously. Unfortunately, this never happens in any corporate environment. Even in great teams, tech debt often gets de-prioritized in the face of new requests. Newcomers to the team or those on their way out, aren’t always disciplined enough to clean up their flags after a successful rollout. And sometimes, these tasks simply slip through the cracks and get forgotten.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24549917" target="_blank">Someone on HackerNews has pointed out</a> that as of Sept-2020, the release version of Windows <em>“has roughly 2500 feature flags. Some are permanently jammed into the on position, some off position, and the rest are configurable by its experimentation frameworks and hackers”</em>.</p>



<p>There is no better illustration of this than the KCG debacle where a financial firm lost half a billion dollars and almost went bankrupt in 30 minutes, partly due to dead code that was behind a feature flag.</p>



<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.bugsnag.com/blog/bug-day-460m-loss"><em>The cause of the failure</em></a><em> was due to multiple factors. However, one of the most important was that a flag which had previously been used to enable Power Peg… Power Peg had been obsolete since 2003, yet still remained in the codebase some eight years later.</em></p><p><em>In 2005, an alteration was made to the Power Peg code which inadvertently disabled safety-checks which would have prevented such a scenario. However, this update was deployed to a production system at the time, despite no effort having been made to verify that the Power Peg functionality still worked</em></p></blockquote>



<hr>



<p>Feature flags are a powerful tool that can help you experiment with new features, manage the rollout of complex epics, and mitigate the problems associated with not controlling your team’s deployments. </p>



<p>But they come at a significant cost, in the form of code complexity, tech debt, slower development speeds, and inevitably, bugs. </p>



<p>As tempting as it may be, there is no silver bullet here. Weigh the pros against the cons, and use this tool judiciously when it makes sense to do so.</p>

    <article>
  
  <p>Sep 13, 2020</p>
  <p>This post describes my own pet theory of programming languages popularity.
My understanding is that no one knows why some languages are popular and others aren’t, so there’s no harm done if I add my own thoughts to the overall confusion.
Obviously, this is all wild speculation and a just-so story without any kind of data backed research.</p>
<p>The central thesis is that the actual programming language (syntax, semantics, paradigm) doesn’t really matter.
What matters is characteristics of the runtime — roughly, what does memory of the running process look like?</p>
<p>To start, an observation.
A lot of software is written in vimscript and emacs lisp (<a href="https://magit.vc/">magit</a> being one example I can’t live without).
And these languages are objectively bad.
This happens even with less esoteric technologies, notable examples being PHP and JavaScript.
While JavaScript is great in some aspects (it’s the first mainstream language with lambdas!), it surely isn’t hard to imagine a trivially better version of it (for example, without two different <code>null</code>s).</p>
<p>This is a general rule — as soon as you have a language which is Turing-complete, and has some capabilities for building abstractions, people will just get the things done with it.
Surely, some languages are more productive, some are less productive, but, overall, FP vs OOP vs static types vs dynamic types doesn’t seem super relevant.
It’s always possible to overcome the language by spending some more time writing a program.</p>
<p>In contrast, overcoming language runtime is not really possible.
If you want to extend vim, you kinda have to use vimscript.
If you want your code to run in the browser, JavaScript is still the best bet.
Need to embed your code anywhere? GC is probably not an option for you.</p>
<p>This two observations lead to the following hypothesis:</p>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<i title="Note"></i>
</td>
<td>
Languages generally become popular when they bring innovative runtime, or when they have runtime exclusivity.
The quality of the language itself is secondary.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Let’s see some examples which can be “explained” by this theory.</p>
<div>
<dl>
<dt>C</dt>
<dd>
<p>C has a pretty spartan runtime, which is notable for two reasons.
First, it was the first fast enough runtime for a high-level language.
It was possible to write the OS kernel in C, which had been typically done in assembly before that for performance.
Second, C is the language of Unix.
(And yes, I would put C into the “easily improved upon” category of languages. Null-terminated strings are just a bad design).</p>
</dd>
<dt>JavaScript</dt>
<dd>
<p>This language has been exclusive in the browsers for quite some time.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Java</dt>
<dd>
<p>This case I think is the most interesting for the theory.
A common explanation for Java’s popularity is “marketing by Sun”, and subsequent introduction of Java into University’s curricula.
This doesn’t seem convincing to me.
Let’s look at the 90’s popular languages (I am not sure about percentage and relative ranking here, but the composition seems broadly correct to me):</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://matklad.github.io/assets/lang-pop.png" alt="lang pop">
</p>

</div>
<p>On this list, Java is the only non-dynamic cross-platform memory safe language.
That is, Java is both memory safe (no manual error-prone memory management) and can be implemented reasonably efficiently (field access is a load and not a dictionary lookup).
This seems like a pretty compelling reason to choose Java, irrespective of what the language itself actually looks like.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Go</dt>
<dd>
<p>One can argue whether focus on simplicity at the expense of everything else is good or bad, but statically linked zero dependency binaries definitely were a reason for Go popularity in the devops sphere.
In a sense, Go is an upgrade over “memory safe &amp; reasonably fast” Java runtime, when you no longer need to install JVM separately.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>Naturally, there are also some things which are not explained by my hypothesis.
One is scripting languages.
A highly dynamic runtime with <code>eval</code> and ability to easily link C extensions indeed would be a differentiator, so we would expect a popular scripting language.
However, it’s unclear why they are Python and PHP, and not Ruby and Perl.</p>
<p>Another one is language evolutions: C++ and TypeScript don’t innovate runtime-wise, yet they are still major languages.</p>
<p>Finally, let’s make some bold predictions using the theory.</p>
<p><em>First</em>, I expect Rust to become a major language, naturally :)
This needs some explanation — on the first, blush, Rust is runtime-equivalent to C and C++, so the theory should predict just the opposite.
But I would argue that memory safety is a runtime property, despite the fact that it is, uniquely to Rust, achieved exclusively via language machinery.</p>
<p><em>Second</em>, I predict Julia to become more popular.
It’s pretty unique, runtime-wise, with its stark rejection of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ousterhout's_dichotomy">Ousterhout’s Dichotomy</a> and insisting that, yeah, we’ll just JIT highly dynamic language to suuuper fast numeric code at runtime.</p>
<p><em>Third</em>, I wouldn’t be surprised if Dart grows.
On the one hand, it’s roughly in the same boat as Go and Java, with memory safe runtime with fixed layout of objects and pervasive dynamic dispatch.
But the quality of implementation of the runtimes is staggering: it has first-class JIT, AOT and JS compilers.
Moreover, it has top-notch hot-reload support.
Nothing here is a breakthrough, but the combination is impressive.</p>
<p><em>Fourth</em>, I predict that Nim, Crystal and Zig (which is very interesting, language design wise) would not become popular.</p>
<p><em>Fifth</em>, I predict that Swift will be pretty popular on Apple hardware due to platform exclusivity, but won’t grow much outside of it, <em>despite</em> being very innovative in language design (generics in Swift are the opposite of the generics in Go).</p>

<p>In Formula 1 racing, you can win a world championship as a driver with one team but then not even make the top 10 without that team’s car and infrastructure. Venture can often feel like this, too. Many top performing VCs would struggle if they weren’t on their firm’s platform. And similarly, a far greater number of VCs might be able to do well if they were just at a firm with a strong enough brand. Most special are those that are the source of their own success.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://kwokchain.com/2019/04/09/making-uncommon-knowledge-common/">Making Uncommon Knowledge Common</a>, I wrote about Rich Barton because he’s one of the rare founders (or investors) with the demonstrated ability to create multiple billion dollar companies. Unpacking and learning from the few who have shown repeatable and internally compounding approaches to building companies is important.</p>



<p>Unlike consumer, traditional enterprise markets lend themselves more naturally to deterministic and repeatable success. There’s a small handful of VCs who have clearly shown they can succeed repeatedly and whose approaches and playbooks are legible enough to imply it’s not a fluke. Speiser is one of them.</p>



<p>Speiser’s portfolio includes companies like Pure Storage and Snowflake Computing. It’s worth noting that Snowflake not only IPO’d and is now at a market cap of over $60B but Speiser and Sutter Hill Ventures owned more than 20% of the company leading up to the IPO. When Pure Storage went public, Sutter Hill held more than 25%. Speiser may have the highest percentage of portfolio companies that have become multi-billion dollar companies—and that trend looks to continue with his newer companies.</p>



<p>But impressive returns are not solely what matters for the industry. It’s tempting to evaluate firms by their returns, and from the LP perspective that may be the correct metric. But another, and more important way to judge VC firms is by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_over_replacement_player">value they add above replacement</a> to their portfolio companies. How much do they help their portfolio companies increase their likelihood and magnitude of success? Firms do this most notably by providing capital, but also by other methods like lending their brand or directly helping with operations.</p>



<p>For founders, this value added is what matters. The returns of a VC firm only matter to a startup insofar as they translate into improved brand, network, or access to capital for the startup. A firm’s financial performance is a reasonable signal that they may add real value and be worth partnering with, especially since some aspects like brand strength for recruiting, future financing, and customer development are a function of perceived firm success. But to prospective portfolio companies, a fund’s returns are important only as a means, not an end.</p>



<p>What makes Speiser intriguing is how distinct his approach is from other VCs. The tantalizing clues suggest that he has figured something out that nobody else has: the formula for creating successful companies from scratch.</p>

<h2>The Speiser playbook</h2>



<p>At the core of Speiser’s approach is incubating companies, or “originating companies” in <a href="https://www.strictlyvc.com/2014/11/10/sam-pullara-entrepreneur-vc-firm/">Sutter Hill nomenclature</a>. Instead of investing in existing companies, Speiser stays solely focused on one thing: starting and building companies. Even among others who have been very successful at incubations, he is the most singularly focused on this.</p>

<p>Every year Speiser incubates around one company. The core of his model is to find 2-3 co-founders and be the founding investor. Often he takes on the interim CEO role himself for the first year or two. This has many advantages. The biggest is that it reshapes the ideal founding team profile. He can focus on getting the right top technical co-founders that will have strong views on what to build and the ability to build it—even if they are people who don’t generally view themselves as having a natural inclination to be founders. This is a significant talent arbitrage.</p>



<h3>A better package for founders</h3>



<p>There has been a dearth of coverage of Snowflake’s three cofounders, Benoit Dageville, Thierry Cruanes, and Marcin Zukowski in both the news and social media. Partially this is because they have not sought the spotlight. But partially, it is due to the veneration of a certain type of founder we have, those who seek the limelight of public presence and being in control of every aspect of the company.</p>



<p>Snowflake’s founders are cut from a different cloth. As Benoit Dageville put it “We never thought of it as building a company. We just wanted to build a cloud product. The company was an afterthought.” Yet, their product and technical decisions have been prescient in threading the narrow path to taking on Amazon and Google in the most important core markets of cloud computing.</p>



<p>There are people who often don’t <em>want</em> to be CEO, or even to start a company. They are driven by their conviction of what the future should look like, as well as their frustration with the internal dynamics they confront at legacy incumbents that prevent them from creating that reality. But they are still unlikely to start a company due to all the inertial cruft that comes with founding a company—and especially with being CEO. They want to build what matters, not set up a new corporate structure, manage fundraising, or build a sales team.</p>



<p>Eric Yuan, the founder and CEO of Zoom, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/21/zoom-founder-left-job-because-he-wasnt-happy-became-billionaire.html">has explained</a> this feeling of being held back at Webex. He knew what should be built and that the Webex team could do it, but given the dynamics of Webex as a subsidiary of Cisco he was unable to get the political capital to do it. And he’s proven himself right by leaving with his Webex teammates and building Zoom. Considering he was VP Engineering at Webex and still unable to build what he thought was important should be a very discomfiting reality shock to large companies about the very real economic harm the malaise of their internal processes have caused. However, for every Eric Yuan, there are countless others that never leave and start a company. The inertial barriers are too high. They can stay at their company and struggle to work on what they know should be built. Or leave and take on more uncertainty and risk than they want.</p>



<p>Speiser introduces a third model that breaks through this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Between_Scylla_and_Charybdis">Scylla and Charybdis</a> dilemma. Start a company with Speiser and stay focused on what you want: deciding what to build, hiring the team you need, and building it. Speiser will handle fundraising, handling the operations generally, and setting up the sales motion and machine. Founders get much of the autonomy and upside of starting a new company while also getting support and guardrails so they can stay focused while having confidence the business is being built well.</p>



<p>Speiser doesn’t just take on these roles because founders don’t want to do it. There are actually aspects of company building where he should be better than the founders. Sutter Hill Ventures has the capital already, so it’s easy for them to take on responsibility for fundraising and remove that as a blocker. Instead of having to burn a lot of cycles fundraising, Sutter Hill can provide the capital. And they often do, leading multiple rounds into their companies. Or they can bring in outside investors, with the confidence that Sutter Hill can lead the entire round as a backstop if the process becomes too much of a hassle. Also, like any VC firm, Sutter Hill builds a brand that compounds their companies’ ability to raise follow on funding. At this point there are multiple firms that have made their bread and butter following on after Sutter Hill, to great success.</p>



<p>Similarly, Speiser is likely to have more experience in setting up companies and the initial customer development process than the founders will. Perhaps most importantly, he has relationships with customers and an established reputation that can be used to bootstrap the initial pilot conversations, which may be the point of highest leverage for these new startups.</p>



<p>These advantages all <em>compound</em> with every incremental company Speiser originates, and not just because of the typical brand network effects that venture has broadly. In many tangible ways, the spread between Speiser’s process knowledge relative to a new founder should widen with every new company.</p>



<p>As an industry we seem to often want to see machismo and martyrdom in founders. A decade ago it was wanting founders to be willing to mortgage their house and their kids’ college fund. Now it is founders wanting to be in charge of every aspect of companies. If founders aren’t willing to put everything on the line for the company their companies will be worse is the thought. As an ecosystem it doesn’t appear the data bears this out. Everything we do that has expanded opportunity and decreased the friction to more people becoming founders has led to huge benefits for the industry.</p>



<p>Just as Eric Yuan should be a massive shot across the bow for all large tech incumbents, Snowflake’s founders should be a wakeup call to venture that we have much further to go to enable and support even more brilliant people who don’t think of themselves as CEOs to bring their vision of the world into existence.</p>



<h3>A better package for CEOs</h3>



<p>But this isn’t the only talent arbitrage Speiser’s playbook benefits from. The interim CEO model allows another one too. As the startup does well and figures out its product market fit, Speiser eventually rolls off as CEO and finds a full-time replacement to take on the role as he takes a step back into being solely a board member.</p>



<p>His companies are <em>very</em> advantaged in finding great CEOs to take the mantle. To understand why, look at it from the perspective of an executive looking to become the CEO of a company. Like the potential founders, these executives have their own Scylla and Charybdis dilemma. They want to be CEO of a company, but they also want to join a company that has already …</p></div></div>

<p>Networking can seem like <em>voodoo</em>; many of us take for granted how data transmits from one computer to the next. Recently, <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">wireguard</a>, has attracted a lot of publicity for it’s inclusion into the Linux kernel &amp; for it’s stated goal of making setting up VPNs simpler.</p>

<p>Behind all the magic, is a very simple premise. Let’s shed some of the complexity and break it down to <em>first principles</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A virtual private network extends a private network across a public network and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://fzakaria.com/assets/images/VPN_overview-en.svg" alt="VPN graphic"></p>

<p>The definition seems <em>simple</em> enough. Bridge two discrete private networks &amp; make them look like they are <strong>one</strong>.</p>

<p>We will accomplish this task with a <em>tunnel</em>.</p>

<!--more-->

<h3 id="network-reachability">Network Reachability</h3>

<p>Let’s consider a very simple example with two distinct private networks: <em>home</em> &amp; <em>office</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Home Network</strong>: Is the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet and has a laptop with the <em>private IP address</em> of 192.168.1.192.</p>

<p><strong>Office Network</strong>: Is the 172.31.0.1/20 subnet and has a server with <em>private IP address</em> of 172.31.9.116 &amp; a <em>public IP address</em> of 54.219.126.112.</p>

<p><img src="https://fzakaria.com/assets/images/vpn_simple_drawing.png" alt="VPN graphic"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I did not include the routers or gateways in the figure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is pretty common to what most people might experience with their home setup.</p>

<p><em>private</em> IP addresses are those that can only be reached from other machines within the subnet.</p>

<p><em>public</em> IP addresses are those that are broadcasted to neighboring routers and exchanged via the BGP protocol.</p>

<p>The goal of the tunnel will be to join these two <em>distinct</em> subnets into a <em>virtual</em> one; a <em>virtual private network</em> (VPN).</p>

<p><img src="https://fzakaria.com/assets/images/vpn_simple_drawing_merge.png" alt="VPN graphic"></p>

<p>Let’s choose a VPN CIDR range of 172.31.255.0/24. I don’t need a subnet so large, so let’s set a mask of /24 which gives us ~254 hosts.</p>

<p>We will then assign two IP addresses within that subnet to the two hosts.</p>

<p><strong>Server</strong>: 172.31.255.13</p>

<p><strong>Laptop</strong>: 172.31.255.7</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The private network address range is 172.16.0.0/12 according to <a href="https://www.arin.net/reference/research/statistics/address_filters/">https://www.arin.net/reference/research/statistics/address_filters/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="tun-network-interface-device">TUN network interface device</h3>

<p>The first step in setting up our tunnel will be to create a <em>tun</em> network interface device<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>. A <em>tun</em> device is a kernel virtual network device, they are not backed by a physical device.</p>

<p>Packets sent by the operating system via the <em>tun</em> device are delivered to a user space program which attaches itself to the device. A userspace program may also pass packets into a <em>tun</em> device. In this case the device delivers these packets to the operating-system network stack thus emulating as if it has arrived from an external source.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>tun</em> devices operate at the L3 layer (IP). There is an analogous <em>tap</em> device that operates at the L2 layer (Ethernet).</p>
</blockquote>

<div><div><pre><code><span># on server &amp; laptop run the following</span>
<span># adding the user will allow userspace programs running as that user</span>
<span># to attach to it without needing `sudo`</span>
<span>&gt;</span> <span>sudo </span>ip tuntap add dev tun0 mode tun user <span>$USER</span>
<span>&gt;</span> <span>sudo </span>ip <span>link set </span>dev tun0 up

<span>&gt;</span> ip <span>-d</span> <span>link </span>show tun0
9: tun0: &lt;POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST,NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 500
    <span>link</span>/none  promiscuity 0 minmtu 68 maxmtu 65535
    tun <span>type </span>tun pi on vnet_hdr off persist on user youruser addrgenmode random numtxqueues 1 numrxqueues 1 gso_max_size 65536 gso_max_segs 65535
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We then need to assign the new <em>private IP addresses</em> for our new subnet.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># on the laptop run the following</span>
<span>&gt;</span> <span>sudo </span>ip addr add 172.31.255.7/24 dev tun0
<span># on the server run the following</span>
<span>&gt;</span> <span>sudo </span>ip addr add 172.31.255.13/24 dev tun0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now let’s create a general routing rule so that anything destined for that subnet routes to the desired <em>tun</em> device.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># run the following on both laptop &amp; server</span>
<span>&gt;</span> <span>sudo </span>ip route add 172.16.0.0/12 dev tun0

<span># Let's validate our route. Pick a machine and</span>
<span># test the route for the other one.</span>
<span>&gt;</span> ip route get 172.31.255.8
172.31.255.8 dev tun0 src 172.31.255.7 uid 780412
    cache
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>We make sure to test the route with an IP address not present on either machine, otherwise it will match to the <em>lo</em> (loopback) device.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Great! We have setup some network interfaces and routing rules, but what is actually transmitting the packets to give the <em>illusion</em> of a single network?</p>

<p>Our <strong>tunneling</strong> software.</p>

<h3 id="lametun">lametun</h3>

<p>The <em>heart</em> to setting up VPN is the software bridging the packets across the two networks. In our case, we will be using a userspace program and the <em>tun</em> device; however <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">wireguard</a> has included this capability within the kernel itself.</p>

<p>Since this will be a <em>toy</em> example, I’ve named the program <strong>lametun</strong>. It will be a single <em>golang</em> file with minimal dependencies to demonstrate how simple it is.</p>

<p><img src="https://fzakaria.com/assets/images/vpn_lametun_simple.png" alt="VPN graphic"></p>

<p><strong>lametun</strong> will read all incoming packets at a particular UDP port (i.e. <em>1234</em>) and write it to the <em>tun</em> device.</p>

<p><strong>lametun</strong> will read all outgoing packets from the <em>tun</em> device and write it back out the physical network device.</p>

<p>Both the <em>server</em> &amp; <em>laptop</em> will run <strong>lametun</strong> on UDP port <em>1234</em>, listening on the physical network device.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Make sure your firewall allows whatever port we are using for <strong>lametun</strong>.
I was using an EC2 host and had to also allow the UDP port through the SecurityGroup as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The TUN device however emits raw L3 packets (IP packets), and the IP address of the device is not-routable. Simply copying the packet to the physical device is not enough; it must be routable.</p>

<p>We will <em>encapsulate</em> the packet with a routable IP &amp; UDP header destined for the VPN peer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>UDP is chosen since there is a lot of literature how TCP over TCP is a bad idea; TCP Meltdown.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="encapsulation">Encapsulation</h3>

<p>Encapsulation as a concept is straightforward. It is the act of embedding a protocol within the data/payload of another. Here we see an example of embedding TCP-IP within the payload of a UDP packet.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">6</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="https://fzakaria.com/assets/images/foo-encap.png" alt="VPN graphic"></p>

<p>Using encapsulation, we can now have non-routable packets traverse the Internet. Once they arrive at the <strong>lametun</strong> destination, the inner packet is forwarded onto the <em>tun</em> device to continue routing.</p>

<h3 id="mtu">MTU</h3>

<p>Typically, in order to guarantee delivery across the Internet, network devices restrict the <em>maximum transmission unit</em> (MTU), which is the size of the Ethernet frame, to <em>1500</em> bytes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although IP protocol supports fragmentation, there is no guarantee that every link along the way does. It’s best to stay within the 1500 byte limit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given that we are embedding our transmission protocol within a IP-UDP datagram, we must account for this reserved headroom accordingly or risk breaking the 1500 byte boundary.</p>

<p>Given that the IP header is 20 bytes (minimum) and the UDP header is 8 bytes, our new MTU is <em>1472</em> bytes.</p>

<p>A simple demonstration will help.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Upper limit MTU is 1500 safely across the Internet</span>
<span># IPv4 header is 20 bytes (minimum)</span>
<span># UDP header is 8 bytes</span>
<span># ICMP header is 8 bytes</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># 1500 - 20 (IP) - 8 (UDP) =  1472 new maximum MTU</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># 1472 - 20 (IP) - 8 (ICMP) = 1444 maximum payload for ICMP payload</span>
<span># (We actually remove another 4 bytes due to metadata the TUN device includes)</span>
<span># = 1440 maximum payload</span>

<span># We will run the following on the laptop</span>
<span>&gt;</span> ping <span>-M</span> <span>do</span> <span>-s</span> 1440 172.31.255.13

<span># Use wireshark to check the packet</span>
<span>&gt;</span> tshark udp port 1234
1 0.000000000 76.242.91.200 → 172.31.9.116 UDP 1514 1234 → 1234 <span>Len</span><span>=</span>1472

<span># If we bump the ICMP payload by a single byte, it will fragment</span>
<span>&gt;</span> ping <span>-M</span> <span>do</span> <span>-s</span> 1441 172.31.255.13

<span>&gt;</span> <span>sudo </span>tshark udp port 1234
1 0.000000000 76.242.91.200 → 172.31.9.116 IPv4 1514 Fragmented IP protocol <span>(</span><span>proto</span><span>=</span>UDP 17, <span>off</span><span>=</span>0, <span>ID</span><span>=</span>3136<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So we simply need to adjust the MTU on our TUN device accordingly.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># run the following on both laptop and server</span>
<span>&gt;</span> <span>sudo </span>ip <span>link set </span>dev tun0 mtu 1472
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="code">Code</h3>

<p>Sweet! Enough theory, show me the code!</p>

<p>I’ve kept the code to a single-file for demonstration purposes but you can also find it on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/fzakaria/lametun">https://github.com/fzakaria/lametun</a>. It is heavily commented for learning purposes.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="blog-post-text"><p><a href="https://github.com/liquidata-inc/dolt">Dolt</a> is a relational database with Git-like version control features. In particular the underlying data storage format is a commit graph, and each commit represents the complete state (schema and data) of the database at a point in time. <a href="https://github.com/liquidata-inc/doltpy">Doltpy</a>, our Python API, provides users with tools to easily move data between their existing databases and Dolt. This post covers adding support for Oracle. We wanted to support Oracle because several customers asked for it. Given how widely adopted it is as a database solution, this is not surprising. Supporting Oracle proved more complicated than the other databases. Most of that complexity comes from Oracle having a model that differs substantially from Postgres and MySQL, as well as how long the database takes to actually startup. We cover how to abstract away this complexity in a clean test fixture in the final section using Docker.</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Let's start with the goal: we want to provide a simple API for moving data from Dolt to Oracle, or from Oracle to Dolt. Let's say we want to get data from the <code>revenue_estimates</code> table in Oracle into Dolt for versioning, we want to write code like this:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> doltpy<span>.</span>etl<span>.</span>sql_sync <span>import</span> sync_from_dolt<span>,</span> get_dolt_target_writer<span>,</span> get_oracle_source_reader

sync_to_dolt<span>(</span>get_oracle_source_reader<span>(</span>oracle_engine<span>)</span><span>,</span>
             get_dolt_target_writer<span>(</span>dolt_repo<span>)</span><span>,</span>
             <span>{</span><span>'revenue_estimates'</span><span>:</span> <span>'revenue_estimates'</span><span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We need some objects for managing database connections, which are defined as follows:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> doltpy<span>.</span>core <span>import</span> Dolt
<span>import</span> sqlalchemy <span>as</span> sa
<span>import</span> cx_Oracle


dolt <span>=</span> Dolt<span>.</span>init<span>(</span><span>'my-org/estiamtes'</span><span>)</span>
dolt<span>.</span>sql_server<span>(</span><span>)</span>

engine <span>=</span> create_engine<span>(</span><span>'oracle+cx_oracle://'</span><span>,</span> creator<span>=</span>_oracle_connection_helper<span>)</span>
<span>def</span> _oracle_connection_helper<span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> cx_Oracle<span>.</span>connect<span>(</span><span>'oracle_user'</span><span>,</span> <span>'oracle_pwd'</span><span>,</span> <span>'{}:{}/{}'</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>'oracle_host'</span><span>,</span> <span>1521</span><span>,</span> <span>'oracle_db'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In order to incorporate Oracle into our SQL Sync tooling we need to verify that we can "round trip" data from Dolt to Oracle, and from Oracle to Dolt. We do the same for Postgres and MySQL. In practice this means we need instances of each of these databases running, and available to our test harness. The most repeatable and portable way we have found is to use <code>pytest-docker</code> to run a containerized instance of each database implementation. The architecture looks something like this:

<li>a Docker image available that stands up an Oracle instance</li>
<li>augment our test harness to run that image, and populate it with a test table</li>
<li>code to execute and test the sync</li>
</ol>
<p>We will examine them in reverse order, starting with the implementation, as that's closest to the user value the feature delivers.</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>Once Oracle was incorporated into our test harness, actually reading and writing from it was straightforward, and done via SQL Alchemy. We focus on the issues caused by how SQL Alchemy maps between higher level types and Oracle types. One main benefit of SQL Alchemy is the <a href="https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/tutorial.html">SQL Expression Language</a> that abstracts over multiple database implementations, something we <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-08-24-schema-support-in-sql-sync/">blogged</a> about. In most cases this takes care of translating between database implementation specific types by providing a higher level set of types. A concrete example is how this higher level expression language allows us to use a single definition of a test table, making our code cleaner and more readable, as well as reducing database implementation specific boilerplate:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> sqlalchemy<span>.</span>types <span>import</span> Integer<span>,</span> DateTime<span>,</span> String<span>,</span> Text<span>,</span> Float<span>,</span> Date

TEST_TABLE_METADATA <span>=</span> Table<span>(</span>TABLE_NAME<span>,</span>
                            MetaData<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
                            Column<span>(</span><span>'first_name'</span><span>,</span> String<span>(</span><span>256</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> primary_key<span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
                            Column<span>(</span><span>'last_name'</span><span>,</span> String<span>(</span><span>256</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> primary_key<span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
                            Column<span>(</span><span>'playing_style_desc'</span><span>,</span> Text<span>)</span><span>,</span>
                            Column<span>(</span><span>'win_percentage'</span><span>,</span> Float<span>)</span><span>,</span>
                            Column<span>(</span><span>'high_rank'</span><span>,</span> Integer<span>)</span><span>,</span>
                            Column<span>(</span><span>'turned_pro'</span><span>,</span> DateTime<span>)</span><span>,</span>
                            Column<span>(</span><span>'date_of_birth'</span><span>,</span> Date<span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the snippet above <code>engine</code> is a SQL Alchemy object that manages a database connection pool. Passing that engine to a call to create the table we just defined will execute the generated query against the corresponding database instance. This is exactly what we do to create a test table in our containerized Oracle instance:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>TEST_TABLE_METADATA.metadata.create_all(engine)</code></pre></div>
<p>The type mapping issue arises because SQL Alchemy translates both <code>sqlalchemy.types.Date</code> and <code>sqlalchemy.types.DateTime</code> to Oracle's <code>DATE</code> type. This is clearly a bug, as this amounts to "destructive" type coercion, and in fact the library should not permit writes of <code>datetime.datetime</code> Python objects to <code>DATE</code> without at least warning the user of information loss. We plan to implement fixes to SQL Alchemy, and push them back to that project as a wider benefit to the community.</p>
<p>For the purposes of using the data sync, however, this is not an issue. This code is purely for creating a test table, and we do not yet support schema sync in Oracle. We work around this in our test suite.</p>
<h3>Test Harness</h3>
<p>In order for us to execute the SQL Alchemy expressions above, we need to incorporate a running Docker image that exposes an Oracle instance to our test harness. We launch our containers via <code>pytest-docker</code>, a <code>pytest</code> plugin that wraps <code>docker-compose</code>. This allows us to define Docker services using dictionaries which are in turn translated into YAML:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>@pytest<span>.</span>fixture</span><span>(</span>scope<span>=</span><span>'session'</span><span>)</span>
<span>def</span> <span>docker_compose_file</span><span>(</span>tmpdir_factory<span>,</span> mysql_service_def<span>,</span> postgres_service_def<span>,</span> oracle_service_def<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    compose_file <span>=</span> tmpdir_factory<span>.</span>mktemp<span>(</span><span>'docker_files'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>join<span>(</span><span>'docker-compose.yml'</span><span>)</span>

    compose_conf <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>'version'</span><span>:</span> <span>'2'</span><span>,</span>
        <span>'services'</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>'mysql'</span><span>:</span> mysql_service_def<span>,</span>
            <span>'postgres'</span><span>:</span> postgres_service_def<span>,</span>
            <span>'oracle'</span><span>:</span> oracle_service_def
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>with</span> compose_file<span>.</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>'w'</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> f<span>:</span>
        yaml<span>.</span>dump<span>(</span>compose_conf<span>,</span> stream<span>=</span>f<span>)</span>

    <span>return</span> compose_file<span>.</span>strpath</code></pre></div>
<p>Note that this fixture itself depends on a test fixture called <code>oracle_service_def</code> which specifies how to launch the Oracle service definition. Again, this fixture returns a dictionary, which is incorporated into <code>docker_compose_file</code> as follows:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>@pytest<span>.</span>fixture</span><span>(</span>scope<span>=</span><span>'session'</span><span>)</span>
<span>def</span> <span>oracle_service_def</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>'image'</span><span>:</span> <span>'oscarbatori/oracle-database:18.4.0-xe-quick'</span><span>,</span>
        <span>'container_name'</span><span>:</span> ORACLE_CONTAINER_NAME<span>,</span>
        <span>'ports'</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>'{port}:{port}'</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span>port<span>=</span>ORACLE_LISTENER_PORT<span>)</span><span>,</span>
                  <span>'{port}:{port}'</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span>port<span>=</span>ORACLE_OEM_EXPRESS_PORT<span>)</span><span>]</span>
    <span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the following section we detail how to get an Oracle image that takes a reasonable amount of time to start (around a minute). That is still too slow for <code>pytest</code> which will throw errors when our fixtures for fetching a SQL Alchemy engine object run. We can put some retry logic around those calls to make the fixture swallow errors for some reasonable period of time until it obtains a connection:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>@pytest<span>.</span>fixture</span>
<span>def</span> <span>oracle_engine</span><span>(</span>docker_ip<span>,</span> docker_services<span>)</span> <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> Engine<span>:</span>
    engine <span>=</span> create_engine<span>(</span><span>'oracle+cx_oracle://'</span><span>,</span> creator<span>=</span><span>lambda</span><span>:</span> _oracle_connection_helper<span>(</span>docker_ip<span>)</span><span>)</span>

    <span>@retry</span><span>(</span>delay<span>=</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> tries<span>=</span><span>12</span><span>,</span> exceptions<span>=</span><span>(</span>sqlalchemy<span>.</span>exc<span>.</span>DatabaseError<span>)</span><span>)</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>verify_connection</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>:</span>
        conn <span>=</span> engine<span>.</span>connect<span>(</span><span>)</span>
        conn<span>.</span>close<span>(</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> engine

    <span>return</span> verify_connection<span>(</span><span>)</span>


<span>def</span> <span>_oracle_connection_helper</span><span>(</span>host<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> cx_Oracle<span>.</span>connect<span>(</span>ORACLE_USER<span>,</span> ORACLE_PWD<span>,</span> <span>'{}:{}/{}'</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span>host<span>,</span> ORACLE_LISTENER_PORT<span>,</span> ORACLE_DB<span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Our test harness is now augmented to fire up a service running an instance of Oracle XE. In order to get this container running we needed to create the actual image, as unlike Postgres and MySQL, there was not a freely available on one on Docker Hub.</p>
<h2>Building an Image</h2>
<p>Up until this point we have assumed the instance of an Oracle image. This proved a little tricky in practice. We found a GitHub repository containing some tools for building images <a href="https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/master/OracleDatabase/SingleInstance">here</a>. We cloned the repo, and ran the following from the appropriate subdirectory:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>$ /buildDockerImage.sh -v 18.4.0 -x</code></pre></div>
<p>After about twenty minutes, this produced an image that we could then use to run a container in our development in environment, in this case locally on OSX:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>$ docker run --name test_oracle \
-p 1521:1521 -p 5500:5500 \
-e ORACLE_PWD=oracle_password \
oracle/database:18.4.0-xe</code></pre></div>
<p>Unfortunately, it takes about 15 minutes for the Oracle database to get into a state were it is accepting connections. This is far too slow for a test suite, as it would make a single test run take more than fifteen minutes. Slow tests discourage developers from using them, increasing the the likelihood of error. Fortunately, Docker provides functionality for creating an image from a running container (credit to <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-09-20-oracle-support-in-sql-sync/(https://medium.com/@ggajos/drop-db-startup-time-from-45-to-3-minutes-in-dockerized-oracle-19-3-0-552068593deb)%20for%20inspiration">this blog post</a>. The following command creates a snapshot of the container we fired up in our dev environment in the previous step:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>$ docker commit --author "Oscar Batori me@my-email.com" --message "Fast Oracle XE snapshot" oscarbatori/oracle-database:18.4.0-xe-quick</code></pre></div>
<p>The image could then be started as follows:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>docker run --name test_oracle \
-p 1521:1521 -p 5500:5500 \
-e ORACLE_PWD=oracle_password \
oscarbatori/oracle-database:18.4.0-xe-quick</code></pre></div>
<p>We now had an image that could present stand up a running Oracle instance in under a minute, allowing us to build the test harness and tests detailed above on top of it.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this post we covered how we incorporated Oracle into our <code>doltpy.etl.sql_sync</code>, a module of the Dolt's Python API, Doltpy, that provides utilities to users who would like to use Dolt alongside existing relational database solutions. We hope that by supporting Oracle we will vastly increase the number of users who are able to capture the benefits for a version controlled SQL database while not having to abandon their existing tools. We have a full SQL Sync guide in our <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/docs/guides/sql-sync/">documentation</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><main id="main-content-container"><article aria-label="New data on the RTB privacy crisis: people with AIDS profiled in Ireland, and Polish elections influenced."><div>
<p><br><strong><em>This note presents new evidence of the scale of the vast RTB data breach, and of the consequences of two years of failure to enforce.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>September 2020 is the two year anniversary of my formal complaint to the Irish Data Protection Commission about the Real-Time Bidding privacy crisis. In these two years, RTB has been allowed to continue to infringe Article 5(1)f of the GDPR, which requires security of personal data. In fact, this vast data breach appears&nbsp;to have worsened.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, we at the ICCL submitted&nbsp;evidence to the DPC that show the consequence of failure to enforce the GDPR to stop the vast RTB data breach at the heart of the online advertising industry.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7xo77grl2mnb6b6/AAAlszXoQ_zM2kUSsSRqKJSqa?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This evidence includes a proven case of electoral influence, profiling of people with AIDS and cancer, and a list of 968 companies that&nbsp;Google sends information to about the private things that we do and&nbsp;watch online</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="405" src="https://www.iccl.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/RTB-broadcast-from-website-DPC-2020.gif" alt=""></figure></div>















<h2>Key insights in the submission&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>



<ul><li>Real-Time Bidding operates behind the scenes on websites and apps. It constantly broadcasts the private things we do and watch online, and where we are in the real-world, to countless companies. As a result, we are all an open book to data broker companies, and others, who can build intimate dossiers about each of us. <strong>Google’s RTB system sends this data to 968 companies (see <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/6.-The-964-companies-that-Google-sends-our-data-to-Appendix-F.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Appendix F for a 25&nbsp;page list of these companies</a>).&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>

    </time>
  </p>

  <p>This is my Rust 2021 post. I believe that Rust has shown that “bending the curve” is
both possible and fruitful in programming language design. We also have a strong set
of values as a community, enshrined both in the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a> and the example of
various high-profile rustaceans.</p>

<p>For 2021 I really couldn’t care less what features go into the next edition. Don’t
get me wrong, I want the next edition to be awesome, but I believe this is table
stakes by now. I want us to take on the harder problems.</p>

<p>I want us to grow as a community, and I don’t mean that in a population count sense.
This is what I meant when I snarkily wrote “Less doing the wrong thing, safely”. The
keyword here is <em>ethical development</em>. Just like the Rust programming language has a
set of vaues, a set of tradeoffs between them, and a set of bent curves where we
found a place in the design space that lets us have our cake and eat it where this
was a formerly accepted tradeoff, I want the Rust community to have a shared set of
values, a shared set of tradeoffs between them, and as much bent curves as possible.</p>

<p>Now what I mean by ‘values’ obviously differs when I talk about programming language
design or a programming language community. For language design, the values can
contain execution speed, productivity, safety, learnability and so on. For software
ethics values may be inclusion and diversity, welfare for all people, privacy,
freedom, lawfulness, friendlyness and hospitality, integrity, humor, and a lot more.
Some of them are by now well-known and have seen implementations, for example
privacy. But how might we hope to encode e.g. hospitality?</p>

<p>There are a few hard questions to ask, and I won’t cover everything here, but I’ll
give you a few examples of things the Rust community will have to face at some
point:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I have heard reports of companies treating their Rust developers badly. As if
using Rust should make up for abuse by an employer. This is obviously unacceptable,
and we should call out instances wherever we find them. Such employers should not
be considered part of the community (Names withheld to protect the innocent)</li>
  <li>Rust is still hosted on github, a company that has a contract with ICE, a
institution that has proven to act out genocide against immigrants in the US. For
now, we act as if this doesn’t affect us and have the mod team quell all
discussion. I’m having a hard time bringing this up after having personally
removed discussion about it on /r/rust. But while we don’t want the drama to
continue, and expressly wish this point not to debated in the replies, we as a
community need to tackle this problem</li>
  <li>I’m still not writing that “why we shouldn’t write more blockchains in Rust”
article just yet, but as I’ve written before, Blockchain tech hasn’t showed much
benefit to society just yet while binding a lot of resources and burning through a
lot of electricity (obviously proof of stake is better than proof of work in that
regard, but being better than the worst thing doesn’t make something good), thus
hastening the climate crisis</li>
</ul>

<p>So here’s my suggestions: I want an Ethics WG, tasked with both researching and
teaching Rustic Software Ethics. With the above examples, I hope to have given a
useful set of initial work items for that group.</p>

  <p>I upgraded my home internet connection to fibre (FTTP) <a href="https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/2019/10/native-ipv6-fttp.html">last October</a>. I’m still on an 80M/20M service, so it’s no faster than my old VDSL FTTC connection was, and as a result for a long time I continued to use my HomeHub 5A running <a href="https://openwrt.org/">OpenWRT</a>. However the FTTP ONT meant I was using up an additional ethernet port on the router, and I was already short, so I ended up with a GigE switch in use as well. Also my wifi is handled by a <a href="https://unifi-network.ui.com/">UniFi</a>, which takes its power via Power-over-Ethernet. That mean I had a router, a switch and a PoE injector all in close proximity. I wanted to reduce the number of devices, and ideally upgrade to something that could scale once I decide to upgrade my FTTP service speed.</p>

<p>Looking around I found the <a href="https://mikrotik.com/product/RB3011UiAS-RM">MikroTik RB3011UiAS-RM</a>, which is a rack mountable device with 10 GigE ports (plus an SFP slot) and a dual core <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/ipq8064">Qualcomm IPQ8064</a> ARM powering it. There’s 1G RAM and 128MB NAND flash, as well as a USB3 port. It also has PoE support. On paper it seemed like an ideal device. I wasn’t particularly interested in running RouterOS on it (the provided software), but that’s based on Linux and there was some work going on within OpenWRT to add support, so it seemed like a worthwhile platform to experiment with (what, you expected this to be about me buying an off the shelf device and using it with only the supplied software?). As an added bonus a friend said he had one he wasn’t using, and was happy to sell it to me for a bargain price.</p>

<p><img alt="RB3011 router in use" src="https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/images/2020/rb3011.jpg"></p>

<p>I did try out RouterOS to start with, but I didn’t find it particularly compelling. I’m comfortable configuring firewalling and routing at a Linux command line, and I run some additional services on the router like my <a href="https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/2018/05/mqtt-broker.html">MQTT</a> broker, and <a href="https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/2018/09/netlink-arp-presence.html">mqtt-arp</a>, my wifi device presence monitor. I could move things around such that they ran on the <a href="https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/2019/07/upgrading-the-house-server.html">house server</a>, but I consider them core services and as a result am happier with them on the router.</p>

<p>The first step was to get something booting on the router. Luckily it has an RJ45 serial console port on the back, and a reasonably featured bootloader that can manage to boot via tftp over the network. It wants an ELF binary rather than a plain kernel, but Sergey Sergeev had done the hard work of getting <a href="https://github.com/adron-s/uboot-ipq806x">u-boot working for the IPQ8064</a>, which mean I could just build normal u-boot images to try out.</p>

<p>Linux upstream already had basic support for a lot of the pieces I was interested in. There’s a slight fudge around <code>AUTO_ZRELADDR</code> because the network coprocessors want a chunk of memory at the start of RAM, but there’s ongoing discussions about how to handle this cleanly that I’m hopeful will eventually mean I can drop that hack. Serial, ethernet, the QCA8337 switches (2 sets of 5 ports, tied to different GigE devices on the processor) and the internal NOR all had drivers, so it was a matter of crafting an appropriate DTB to get them working. That left niggles.</p>

<p>First, the second switch is hooked up via SGMII. It turned out the IPQ806x <code>stmmac</code> driver didn’t initialise the clocks in this mode correctly, and neither did the <code>qca8k</code> switch driver. So I need to fix up both of those (Sergey had handled the stmmac driver, so I just had to clean up and submit his patch). Next it turned out the driver for talking to the Qualcomm firmware (SCM) had been updated in a way that broke the old method needed on the IPQ8064. Some git archaeology figured that one out and provided a solution. Ansuel Smith helpfully provided the DWC3 PHY driver for the USB port. That got me to the point I could put a Debian armhf image onto a USB stick and mount that as root, which made debugging much easier.</p>

<p>At this point I started to play with configuring up the device to actually act as a router. I make use of a number of VLANs on my home network, so I wanted to make sure I could support those. Turned out the stmmac driver wasn’t happy reconfiguring its MTU because the IPQ8064 driver doesn’t configure the FIFO sizes. I found what seem to be the correct values and plumbed them in. Then the <code>qca8k</code> driver only supported port bridging. I wanted the ability to have a trunk port to connect to the upstairs switch, while also having ports that only had a single VLAN for local devices. And I wanted the switch to handle this rather than requiring the CPU to bridge the traffic. Thankfully it’s easy to find a copy of the QCA8337 datasheet and the kernel <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/dsa/index.html">Distributed Switch Architecture</a> is pretty flexible, so I was able to implement the necessary support.</p>

<p>I stuck with Debian on the USB stick for actually putting the device into production. It makes it easier to fix things up if necessary, and the USB stick allows for a full Debian install which would be tricky on the 128M of internal NAND. That means I can use things like <a href="https://wiki.nftables.org/">nftables</a> for my firewalling, and use the standard Debian packages for things like <a href="https://collectd.org/">collectd</a> and <a href="https://mosquitto.org/">mosquitto</a>. Plus for debug I can fire up things like tcpdump or tshark. Which ended up being useful because when I put the device into production I started having weird IPv6 issues that turned out to be a lack of proper Ethernet multicast filter support in the IPQ806x ethernet device. The driver would try and setup the multicast filter for the IPv6 NDP related packets, but it wouldn’t actually work. The fix was to fall back to just receiving all multicast packets - this is what the vendor driver does.</p>

<p>Most of this work will be present once the 5.9 kernel is released - the basics are already in 5.8. Currently not queued up that I can think of are the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>stmmac IPQ806x FIFO sizes. I sent out an RFC patch for these, but didn’t get any replies. I probably just need to submit this.</li>
  <li>NAND. This is missing support for the QCOM ADM DMA engine. I’ve sent out the patch I found to enable this, and have had some feedback, so I’m hopeful it will get in at some point.</li>
  <li>LCD. AFAICT LCD is an ST7735 device, which has kernel support, but I haven’t spent serious effort getting the SPI configuration to work.</li>
  <li>Touchscreen. Again, this seems to be a zt2046q or similar, which has a kernel driver, but the basic attempts I’ve tried don’t get any response.</li>
  <li>Proper SFP functionality. The IPQ806x has a PCS module, but the stmmac driver doesn’t have an easy way to plumb this in. I have ideas about how to get it working properly (and it can be hacked up with a fixed link config) but it’s not been a high priority.</li>
  <li>Device tree additions. Some of the later bits I’ve enabled aren’t yet in the mainline RB3011 DTB. I’ll submit a patch for that at some point.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall I consider the device a success, and it’s been entertaining getting it working properly. I’m running a mostly mainline kernel, it’s handling my house traffic without breaking a sweat, and the fact it’s running Debian makes it nice and easy to throw more things on it as I desire. However it turned out the RB3011 isn’t as perfect device as I’d hoped. The PoE support is passive, and the UniFi wants 802.1af. So I was going to end up with 2 devices. As it happened I picked up a cheap <a href="https://eu.dlink.com/uk/en/products/dgs-1210-series-gigabit-smart-plus-switches">D-Link DGS-1210-10P</a> switch, which provides the PoE support as well as some additional switch ports. Plus it runs Linux, so more on that later…</p>

<p>Writing is…hard. Like most aspiring bloggers, my folders of drafts and my dreams of future prolificness outweigh my actual output.</p>

<p>I’ve found a curious trick for getting over this hurdle, though: writing tweet threads. I’ve published many little bursts of tweets about topics I’m curious about:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt/status/1272542423001022467">connections between change in physical architecture and software</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt/status/1250443671020986368">pondering Airtable’s macro system</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt/status/1177607448682582016">the danger of “app-ifying” spreadsheets</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt/status/1258769298862100483">digging into the history of Applescript</a></li>
</ul>

<p>These are exactly the kinds of things I’d like to blog about! But somehow, I’ve found it 10 times easier to publish the tweet threads.</p>

<p>I can hear you groaning already. Of course tweeting is easier than writing, you dummy! Our minds are being driven into the meat grinder 280 characters at a time, as we replace deep logical thought with aphorisms and memes. Twitter is PowerPoint thinking on steroids.</p>

<p>But I think this dismissive response misses the point. We can’t really understand Twitter by treating it as a mediocre replacement for essays and research papers. We need to see it as a new medium on its own terms. In particular, <strong>Twitter is a medium for <em>sketching</em></strong>—for playing with ideas, on the fly. Twitter is more similar to scribbling on a whiteboard or tossing ideas around at the cafe than writing a book. (By sketching I don’t mean literally just drawing; I mean any lightweight early expression of a thought.)</p>

<p>Why does Twitter work so well for this? Here are some of my theories:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The right constraints</strong>: Good sketching tools provide the right limits on what you can do. Twitter’s constraints go beyond the obvious character count.</li>
<li><strong>Low barriers</strong>: Twitter makes it easy to get started. But, crucially, it also makes it easy to <em>finish</em>!</li>
<li><strong>A social context</strong>: Twitter provides a highly interconnected context for thinking. Should we be worried it takes it too far?</li>
</ul>

<p>By reflecting on these properties, I think we can gain some insight not just into Twiter specifically, but also the broader landscape of tools for thinking. Let’s dive in.</p>

<h2 id="the-right-constraints">The right constraints</h2>

<p>Thinking about big new things is hard, and our brains are good at finding ways to weasel out of the job by finding something easier to do, but still plausibly productive. Unfortunately, in the early stages of sketching out an idea, such distractions abound: worrying about word choice in the last paragraph instead of writing the next one, futzing with the font size, making a new blog system instead of writing the damn blog post.</p>

<p>We can try to avoid these temptations, but an easier route is to simply find tools that don’t allow have the temptations in the first place. <strong>This is a key property of good sketching tools: they provide the right constraints.</strong></p>

<h3 id="tiny-linear-atomic-outlines">Tiny, linear, atomic outlines</h3>

<p>Let’s examine a few of Twitter’s valuable constraints.</p>

<p>Start with the obvious one: <strong>the 280 character limit</strong>. Twitter’s main constraint is encouraging concision. It’s hard to dwell on word choice when you have so little space to work with. Twitter’s conversational tone also helps here—I can just <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/talk.html">write like I talk</a>, and any fancy words would seem out of place. And of course, I can’t tweak fonts and margins, which cuts off a distraction vector.</p>

<p>But threads complicate the story of character limits a bit. The limit isn’t really that your entire point must fit into one tweet—it’s that <strong><em>each</em> of your individual points must squeeze under the limit</strong>. This provides a different useful constraint: each idea has to be wrapped in a little atomic package. I find this helpful for figuring out the boundaries between my thoughts and clarifying the discrete units of an argument.</p>

<p>That constraint sort of resembles the benefits of an outlining tool. But Twitter has another constraint: <strong>a thread is linear</strong>! No indenting allowed. This forces a brisk straightline through the argument, instead of getting mired in the fine points of the sub-sub-sub-arguments of the first idea. Very limiting, but simultaneously freeing.</p>

<p>Taken together, these constraints frame the pros and cons of the medium, its appropriate range of usage. Obviously, writing a book in a single-level outline would be foolish, but it works for a rough sketch. More interestingly, I think Twitter is useless for persuading a skeptical reader; there’s simply not space for providing enough detail and context. This is a common property of media for sketching: the initial mockup isn’t impressive enough to sway a user, even if it’s a useful tool for the internal team. I prefer to use Twitter as a way to workshop ideas with sympathetic parties who already have enough context to share my excitement about the ideas.</p>

<p>Perhaps there’s a general principle here: Twitter is good for sketching ideas for the same reasons it’s bad for fully developing them. You can’t accidentally start writing a book in Twitter, and that’s kind of the point.</p>

<h3 id="the-puzzle-of-constraints">The puzzle of constraints</h3>

<p>In general, what are the <em>right</em> constraints for a sketching tool? I think this question is deeper than it seems at first glance.</p>

<p>You might say something like “only offer the minimum fidelity needed to convey the point,” but I think it’s not obvious how to define that minimum level. <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.3-chapter-04#fat-marker-sketches">Sketching with a fat marker</a> can prevent us from getting too detailed with our drawings; <a href="https://museapp.com/">Muse</a>, which I’ve been using for iPad sketching recently, intentionally limits your ink choices to just a few colors.</p>

<p>This works great for certain kinds of thinking and mockups. But for designing new interactions with animation and physics, we need <a href="http://notebook.maryrosecook.com/Prototypingtools.html">a totally different class of tools</a> with more capabilities! The line between essential and spurious depends on the goal.</p>

<p>Providing the right constraints isn’t always a matter of removing. It can require adding advanced capabiliites too, like this <a href="https://distill.pub/2017/aia/">typeface design tool</a> that uses fancy machine learning to provide a few simple knobs for controlling things like “bold.” It doesn’t let you move individual vector points, but instead lets you operate at a more natural level of abstraction.</p>

<p>If you’re not careful, constraints can easily damage fluidity—as <a href="http://gordonbrander.com/pattern/brick-pencil/">Engelbart showed</a>, tying a brick to a pencil does not yield a productive tool.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://www.geoffreylitt.com/images/article_images/engelbart-brick-pencil.jpg?1600706839">
<figcaption>Surprise, surprise: writing with a “brick pencil” makes it harder to think big thoughts</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Overall, it seems that we want constraints that help keep us on track with fluid thought, but don’t rule out too many interesting possibilities. Considering both of these criteria together is a subtle balancing act, and I don’t see easy answers.</p>

<h2 id="low-barriers">Low barriers</h2>

<p>There’s a <strong>low barrier to starting</strong> on Twitter. Just click a button, type a thought, no need to spend a minute remembering how to start my blog server. Often, that first minute of friction is enough to prevent me from getting into the flow of writing.</p>

<p>But the more interesting phenomenon is the <strong>low barrier to finishing</strong>. On Twitter, a single sentence is a completely acceptable unit of publication. Anything beyond that is sort of a bonus. In contrast, most of my blog posts go unpublished because I fear they’re not complete, or not good enough in some dimension. These unpublished drafts are obviously far more complete than a single tweet, but because they’re on a blog, they don’t feel “done,” and it’s hard to overcome the fear of sharing.</p>

<p>This seems like a crucial part of sketching tools: when you make a sketch, it should be understood that your idea is immature, and feel safe to share it in that state. <strong>There’s a time and a place for polished, deeply thorough artifacts… and it’s not Twitter!</strong> Everyone knows you just did a quick sketch.</p>

<p>I believe that quantity leads to quality. <a href="https://kottke.org/09/02/art-and-fear">The students who make more pots in ceramics class improve faster than the students who obsess over making a single perfect pot</a>. A tool with a built-in low barrier to finishing makes it easier to overcome the fear, do more work, and share it at an earlier stage.</p>



<p>In my experience, sketching always requires a delicate dance between individual thought and collaboration. You sketch to clarify something for yourself, but also to communicate with others. I think a good sketching medium should account for both halves of the process.</p>

<p>Writing a blog can feel like a lonely one-way mirror: release something into the world, maybe get a few comments back and some Hacker News snark. In contrast, <strong>Twitter is a bazaar, buzzing with activity</strong>. The engagement ratio is totally different. You can easily have micro-conversations around individual points in a thread. When the same people start showing up time after time, it starts to feel like <a href="https://twitter.com/simonsarris/status/1270744181313503234">seeing acquaintances in a village</a>. On Twitter, I write for my Twitter friends, not for some amorphous crowd.</p>

<p>At its best, this engagement leads to the kind of back-and-forth that characterizes my favorite kinds of sketching sessions. Ideas are in the air, it’s not clear where they came from really, they combine to form new ones in realtime. For me, Twitter does an oddly good job at simulating the thrilling creative energy of a whiteboarding session. People pop in and out of the conversation offering insights; trees and sub-trees form riffing off of earlier points.</p>

<p>Of course, my feeling of safety here presumes healthy engagement from other parties, a privilege not enjoyed by all. I suppose it’s kind of odd that such a globally public medium is suitable at all for sketching—it seems only possible because I’ve found safe, trusting mini-communities, defined by informal and permeable boundaries. Perhaps a more private Twitter would be even better for sketching, although it might cut out new people from entering the conversation?</p>



<p>In an attempt to <em>sketch</em> more in the blog medium, I just whipped up this blog post in a couple hours, so I don’t really have a grand conclusion. And yet I’m still hitting …</p></div></div>

          <p><img width="1080" height="634" src="https://3laqvw22wekb3ykm8z4dbnq8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ft-time-to-hire-new-QA-tester.jpg" alt="8 ways to know that it’s time to hire a new QA tester" srcset="https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ft-time-to-hire-new-QA-tester.jpg 1080w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ft-time-to-hire-new-QA-tester-300x176.jpg 300w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ft-time-to-hire-new-QA-tester-1024x601.jpg 1024w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ft-time-to-hire-new-QA-tester-768x451.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px">      </p>	  
    
        <blockquote><p>You want top-quality software, sure. But when is it time to increase the size of the testing team, so that you can deliver said top-quality software? Glad you asked.</p></blockquote>
<p>QA testers are part investigative reporter, part janitor—and all important to the user experience. That’s because the testers’ role is to hunt for untidy coding and to ensure that any user interaction with your software is free from error. As a result, every company worth its engineering chops knows it needs QA testers to do this crucial, sometimes dirty, work. The issue is: When do you bring on new people? How do you know it’s time to hire another QA professional?</p>
<p>In a perfect world, there would be a formula, like “hire one software tester for every five developers,” that is, runs <code>numQATesters = (numDevs+numFeatures)/(5+weWroteTests)</code>. But as life (and code) is imperfect, I came up with a few simple guidelines to justify your budget request.</p>
<p>Don’t thank me. A streamlined user experience is thanks enough.&nbsp;Particularly when it’s <em>your</em> software that I’m using.</p>
<h3>When your software is buggy</h3>
<p>Bugs are annoying yet inevitable errors that range from low priority (font change, alignment issues in text) to “Call the crisis PR team, stat!” (such as loss or exposure of data). And as we all know, a single critical flaw can result in customer dissatisfaction and a high bill from your crisis PR team. Or from the lawyers.</p>
<p>Jennifer Willy, editor of <a href="https://etia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Etia.com</a>, considers bug complaints and customer issues a call to action, where the action is hiring a new QA tester. “User experience is vital. When you are faced with a situation like this, it is important to rely on good testers.” Hiring excellent testing staff both helps you <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/6-ways-to-improve-your-debugging-skills/">unravel the buggy situation</a> and also brings about a positive change in the software development process, Willy says.</p>
<p>(Of course, the lack of testers is one possible reason the software got into that sorry state. But that’s another discussion.)</p>
<p><em>Recommended hire</em>: A careful QA tester who can find bugs and other errors that the development team has overlooked. A QA with the patience of a saint, specifically Saint Monica, the saint most associated with patience.</p>
<h3>When your QA team is backlogged</h3>
<p>Christian Lavender, chief product officer of vehicle refinancing platform <a href="https://www.rategenius.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RateGenius</a>, says that it’s time to take on a new team member when QA can’t keep up with developer output. “You can hire more engineers to get projects built faster, but if your team doesn’t have the bandwidth to test releases, they’ll just sit in the QA backlog.”</p>
<p>If your developers produce more code than you can thoroughly test in a reasonable amount of time before your QA team drowns in <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/the-icky-sticky-tale-of-test-case-management/">a sea of test cases</a>, it’s time to consider pinging HR. Do so sooner rather than later, because as Lavender says, “When there’s a bottleneck in QA, it ripples across the company.”</p>
<p><em>Recommended hire</em>: An octopus. During crunch time, eight hands are better than two.</p>
<h3>When your QA staff is overworked</h3>
<p>If your QA department is working overtime, on weekends, and are called in during holidays, it means they’re handling an unusually heavy load. And if you overwork your QA staff, there’s no telling if your application’s name fields will accept <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/how-elon-musk-pronounces-x-ae-a-12-his-new-sons-name/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">user names like “X Æ A-12.”</a></p>
<p>“If you find that you’re spending more and more time testing than necessary, then you know it might be worth considering hiring a new QA tester,” says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/colinlma/">Colin Ma</a>, the founder of <a href="https://www.octechalliance.com/">OC Tech Alliance</a>.</p>
<p><em>Recommended hire</em>: A QA tester who knows how to tap out when pinned to a wrestling mat.&nbsp;A QA who would never name their child X AE A-12.</p>
<h3>When you expand your application platforms</h3>
<p>Your QA team excels at what it does, and what it does is testing desktop software. But what happens <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/the-mobile-testing-gotchas-you-need-to-know-about/">when your users access your site on their cell phones</a>?</p>
<p>Your customer base should drive your next hire, says Lavender. “What devices do they use? What browser versions are they on? Are they on tablet, mobile, or desktop? Looking at all those breakdowns would drive you to the methods your QA team would use and what the specialties they would need.”</p>
<p><em>Recommended hire</em>: Someone who specializes in banking apps on iOS devices from versions 10 to 13 using Firefox versions 78 through 82, but only on Tuesdays during a full moon. Someone who <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/what-testers-should-know-about-domain-knowledge/">specializes in every other testing scenario</a>, too.</p>
<h3>When your QA team asks you to</h3>
<p>You’re in the software planning phase, and the project manager is laying out the scope of work. Joining you in the room is your QA team lead. Looking at the project, they say it straight up: “We need to hire more testers.”</p>
<p>Egor Bulyhin, project manager and team lead at consulting firm <a href="https://smart-it.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smart IT</a>, says a good QA professional lets you know when work is beyond even their leet skillz. Part of a professional’s skill set is knowing their own limitations, including when they need more people to maintain a steady flow of approved features. It’s up to you to see that they get what they need (unless they need an early retirement).</p>
<p><em>Recommended hire</em>: A QA tester who isn’t afraid to tell you that you need a new hire. A QA tester who isn’t afraid to tell you that your fly is unzipped.</p>
<h3>When you need to keep your customer’s data secure</h3>
<p>Some testing specialties are less about platforms than reliability – including software security. Do you have someone qualified to find application vulnerabilities during testing?</p>
<p>When it comes to sensitive information, you need a higher level of either data or application integrity, Ma says. “One issue could be costly.” Issues include breach of trust or regulatory infractions that result in fines. If your product requires rock-solid data integrity, such as banking applications, you need a tester with relevant experience.</p>
<p>Even if you’re outside a regulatory regime, like the EU’s GDPR, you may still need to comply with it if you support EU customers. Also, have you ever read the term “data breach” in a feel-good piece? No, I didn’t think so.</p>
<p><em>Recommended hire</em>: Someone who knows what the acronym <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GDPR</a> stands for. Someone who winces when you say “<a href="https://www.scmagazine.com/home/security-news/whats-really-changed-three-years-after-equifax-breach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Equifax</a>.”</p>
<h3>When you need someone in a leadership position</h3>
<p>Let’s say your QA team has been working together for months, and each member excels at the job they’ve always done. But the work is piecemeal, with no cohesion or strategy. It’s time to hire someone with leadership abilities.</p>
<p>Jessica Salter, people operations manager of <a href="https://www.bestresponsemedia.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Best Response Media</a>, needed someone who could create guidelines for future best practices. In making the hire, the key attribute was finding someone in a leadership position “to help us establish a strategy and implement new ways of working.” This particular hire should have management experience, to mentor the current QA team and set them up for future success.</p>
<p><em>Recommended hire</em>: Someone who has a plan for future strategies. And might know future lottery numbers.</p>
<h3>When your business is growing</h3>
<p>Maybe your application is getting new functionality. Or perhaps you’re developing an entire new product line. Or your business is among those <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/08/style/guitar-sales-fender-gibson.html?fbclid=IwAR39kZlhJCKPqaUmzO9Ix18hFklDs-dnN1M7-yytGPT7EPD6Z4e4drgUY7E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">getting a sales boost due to the pandemic</a>, which means it’s time to take on long-delayed projects.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason: On your to-hire list are several new developers. Make sure you add to this list a new QA professional, or you may experience that deadline-slaying backlog mentioned above.</p>
<p>Bulyhin likes to hire QA staff members before a new project begins, so he can onboard them before work ramps up in earnest. More importantly, he works with them to <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/the-best-qa-job-interview-questions-for-managers-to-ask/">make sure the new QA hire</a> has the skills they need for this particular job. This way, they both can achieve their work goals.</p>
<p>Recommended hire: Someone who has been there, done that, and <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%2522quality+assurance%2522+t-shirts&amp;atb=v63-1&amp;iar=images&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has the t-shirts</a>. Very likely, the t-shirt reads, “A QA tester walks into a bar. Orders a beer. Orders 3.33 beers. Orders null beers. Orders &amp;@% beers.”</p>
<blockquote><p>Whomever you hire, surely you want someone with a steady grasp on <a href="https://www.functionize.com/project/getting-started-with-test-automation/">test automation essentials</a>? Our white paper gives you the basics.</p></blockquote>

This isn't happening. Please use more discernment.'"</p>    <p>QAnon&nbsp;is a conspiracy theory that&nbsp;posits that&nbsp;U.S. President Donald Trump is secretly fighting an international&nbsp;cabal of Satan-worshipping, leftist elites&nbsp;who are&nbsp;running a global child sex trafficking&nbsp;ring.</p>  <p>It tends to overlap with conspiracy theories that involve anti-vaccination and anti-mask beliefs, and has roots in anti-Semitism and white supremacy.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Once relegated to the fringes of the internet, QAnon has&nbsp;recently made its way into more mainstream spaces. QAnon supporter&nbsp;Marjorie Taylor Greene recently<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/us-primaries-greene-omar-1.5683022a"> won the Republican nomination in Georgia's primary race</a>, and the president himself has referred to the conspiracy theory's followers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/19/us/politics/trump-qanon-conspiracy-theories.html">as people who "love our country."</a></p>    <p>But it's also started gaining&nbsp;significant traction among people who are into wellness,&nbsp;yoga, spirituality&nbsp;and alternative medicine.</p>  <p><em>Conspirituality,</em> a podcast that examines the links between wellness and conspiracy, has curated a list&nbsp;<a href="https://conspirituality.net/redpilled/">of more than two dozen wellness influencers</a> who have alluded to QAnon in their posts.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Corn says she started to notice it creeping into her social media feed at the start of the pandemic, with its followers&nbsp;using "yoga speak" and wellness branding to radicalize people online.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"The colours might be pastel. The fonts are very specific. There's maybe one post of someone doing yoga. Then the next day it's their food. The next day, it's a lifestyle shot," she said.</p>  <p>"But on maybe the fourth day, there's going to be a post that says, you know, very prettily "COVID is a hoax" and then a bunch of slides that keep giving misinformation and invite you to another link that then gives you more misinformation."</p>  <h2>'Magical thinking'&nbsp;</h2>  <p>For Corn, the conspiracy theory's proliferation in her community is not all that surprising.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"In the wellness community, there's often a lot of magical thinking," she said.</p>  <p>For example, she says people may turn to&nbsp;crystals or prayer as a Band-Aid solution for their life's problems, without engaging with those problems on a deeper level.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"I think that some of the messaging in QAnon&nbsp;is appealing to magical thinking. People are afraid. Their instincts are telling them that there's something else going on, but 'I just don't know what it is. I think I'm being lied to,'" she said.</p>  <p>"Someone is coming in and saying, 'Actually, you are,' and taking them down this rabbit hole."</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5727102.1600292087!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/qanon-in-quebec.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5727102.1600292087!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/qanon-in-quebec.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5727102.1600292087!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/qanon-in-quebec.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5727102.1600292087!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/qanon-in-quebec.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5727102.1600292087!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/qanon-in-quebec.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5727102.1600292087!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/qanon-in-quebec.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Protesters hold a sign with a QAnon slogan at an anti-mask protest in Montreal. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Jonathan Montpetit/CBC)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Ali Breland,&nbsp;a reporter for Mother Jones who has been covering the overlap between QAnon and wellness, agrees.</p>  <p>He <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/day6/funding-confusion-for-first-nations-schools-qanon-wellness-the-mulan-legend-bring-it-on-turns-20-and-more-1.5711574/qanon-has-found-a-home-among-wellness-influencers-and-new-audiences-says-reporter-1.5711585">told&nbsp;CBC Radio's<em> Day 6 </em>earlier this month</a>&nbsp;that wellness communities were already rife with anti-vaccination sentiment.</p>  <p>"[It's the idea that] these big powerful interests — these external interests that are beyond us, like Big Pharma, that we can't conceptualize, are trying to hurt our children ... and we need to protect them because no one else will," she said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"That's the prevailing belief of QAnon."</p>    <blockquote><span><span><svg version="1.1" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" width="30px" height="25px" viewBox="0 0 52.157 39.117" enable-background="new 0 0 52.157 39.117" space="preserve"><g><g><path fill="000000" d="M22.692,10.113c-5.199,1.4-8.398,4.4-8.398,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.6,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.4,3.4,3.4,6.602   c0,3.799-3.4,6.799-7.4,6.799c-4.6,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z M45.692,10.113   c-5.199,1.4-8.399,4.4-8.399,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.601,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.399,3.4,3.399,6.602c0,3.799-3.399,6.799-7.399,6.799   c-4.601,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z"></path></g></g><g display="none"><g display="inline"> <path fill="000000" d="M6.648,29.759c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.399-3.4-3.399-6.6   c0-3.801,3.399-6.801,7.399-6.801c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z M29.648,29.759   c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.401-3.4-3.401-6.6c0-3.801,3.401-6.801,7.401-6.801   c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z"></path></g></g></svg>There's a lot of women in this community who are sensitive and empathic.

<p>It’s become less common to hear people referred to as “resources” in recent times. There’s more trendy <a href="https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/f89ce89e-3450-417e-a8de-5783353e3d85">“official vocab guidelines”</a>, but what’s really changed? There’s still phrases in common use that sound good but betray the same mindset.</p>



<p>I often hear people striving to <em>“</em><a href="https://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22hire%22+and+%22retain%22+%22best+talent%22"><em>hire and retain the best talent</em></a><em>“</em> as if that is a strategy for success, or as if talent is a limited resource we must <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_for_talent">fight over.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another common one is to describe employees as your <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22employees%22+%22asset%22"><em>“greatest asset”</em></a>.</p>



<p>I’d like to believe both phrases come from the good intentions of valuing people. Valuing individuals as per the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">agile manifesto</a>. I think these phrases betray a lack of consideration of the <em>“…and&nbsp; interactions”</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The implication is organisations are in a battle to win and then protect as big a chunk as they can of a finite resource called <em>“talent”</em>. It’s positioned as a zero-sum game. There’s an implication that the impact of an organisation is a pure function of the <em>“talent”</em> it has accumulated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>People are not Talent. An organisation can amplify or stifle the brilliance of people.&nbsp;It can grow skills or curtail talent.</p>



<p>Talent is not skill. Talent gets you so far but skills can be grown. Does the team take the output that the people in it have the skill to produce? Or does the team provide an environment in which everyone can increase their skills and get more done than they could alone?&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://deming.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/a-bad-system-will-10091-2.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>We might hire the people with the most pre-existing talent, and achieve nothing if we stifle them with a bureaucracy that prevents them from getting anything done. Organizational <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/dont-scar-on-the-first-cut/">scar tissue</a> that gets in the way; policies that demotivate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even without the weight of bureaucracy many teams are really just collections of individuals with a common manager. The outcomes of such groups <em>are</em> limited by the talent and preexisting skill of the people in them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Contrast this with a team into which you can hire brilliant people who’ve <a href="https://benjiweber.co.uk/blog/2020/09/06/reasons-to-hire-inexperienced-engineers/">yet to have the opportunity</a> of being part of a team that grows them into highly skilled individuals. A team that gives everyone space to learn, provides challenges to stretch everyone, provides an environment where it’s safe to fail. Teams that have practices and habits that enable them to achieve great things <em>despite</em> the fallibility and limitations of the talent of each of the people in the team.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While I’m a bear of very little brain, I’ve had the opportunity to be part of great teams that have taught me habits that help me achieve more than I can alone. </p>



<p>Habits like giving and receiving feedback. Like working <em><a href="https://cucumber.io/blog/bdd/inclusive-benefits-of-mob-programming/">together</a></em> to balance each others weaknesses and learn from each other faster.

September 21, 2020 | https://www.cryptologie.net/article/505/why-not-rust-for-security/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.cryptologie.net/article/505/why-not-rust-for-security/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>I read a <a href="https://matklad.github.io/2020/09/20/why-not-rust.html">Why Not Rust?</a> article the other day that was quite good but dismissed the most important reason to use a language to me: <strong>security</strong>. After having worked on a Rust codebase for almost two years now, I thought I would chime in, even though I'll preface the post by saying that Rust is totally the right language you should use if you know what you're doing and are aiming for performance and security, yet I still have some pain points that will make me recommend <a href="https://golang.org/">Golang</a> over Rust sometimes. Keep in mind that I have also spent my whole career looking for bugs in applications written in dozens of different languages, so my post might be highly controversial but it has to be looked from these lenses.</p>
<h2>Shallow standard library</h2>
<p>Working with Rust is like working with Javascript in many ways. While the package manager Cargo is truly awesome, the fact that the standard library misses most features will have you import many third-party dependencies. These dependencies in turn import other third-party dependencies, that import other third-party dependencies, and so on. This blow up of dependencies can quickly become a nightmare, and this is of course a perfect vector of attack for backdoors, like we've seen happen before in javascript land (<a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2018/05/npm-getcookies-backdoor">https://www.infoq.com/news/2018/05/npm-getcookies-backdoor</a>/, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/hacker-backdoors-popular-javascript-library-to-steal-bitcoin-funds">https://www.zdnet.com/article/hacker-backdoors-popular-javascript-library-to-steal-bitcoin-funds</a>/).</p>
<p>Not only this, but if you're a newcomer to Rust, how do you even pick the right library? I can't even fathom how anyone writing a project in Rust gets to pick a good library for generating cryptographic random numbers, or for doing any type of crypto like encrypting or hashing, or for decoding hex strings, or for decoding JSON, or for using TCP, or even for using TLS! On the other hand Golang has all of that in its standard library, that means that when you use Golang you:</p>
<ul>
<li>can't pick the wrong algorithm (e.g. DES instead of AES)</li>
<li>can't pick a bad implementation (the standard library is known to be high quality) </li>
<li>can't pick a dependency that ends up importing plenty of other third-party dependencies (unlike Rust, the Golang standard library never imports third-party libraries)</li>
<li>don't have to worry about version updates (you're just updating your version of Golang instead of the versions of many dependencies)</li>
<li>don't have to worry about transitive dependencies that you can't update (again, Golang standard library doesn't rely on third-party dependencies)</li>
</ul>
<p>For <a href="http://libra.org/">Libra</a> we've used a number of techniques in order to reduce the number of third-party dependencies we use. This included figuring out when we used different dependencies that did the same thing, or figuring out what obscure dependencies we should avoid, we even re-wrote a large number of dependencies to avoid dependencies that ended up exploding the number of transitive third-party dependencies we imported. One useful tool we used for some of that is <a href="https://github.com/mimoo/cargo-dephell">dephell</a> which is built on top of <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/cargo-guppy">guppy</a>.</p>
<h2>Rustfmt is imperfect</h2>
<p><code>rustfmt</code> is great, but <code>rustfmt</code> sucks. Why does it suck? Two reasons: </p>
<ul>
<li>it's not mandatory</li>
<li>it's configurable</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, Golang's compiler is very strict and will yell at you early on if you have dead code, unused dependencies, badly formatted code, and so on. It doesn't replace <code>gofmt</code>, but it's much more opinionated and is much more effective at making Golang's codebases more readable (especially if they forget to run <code>gofmt</code>). In addition, if you do use <code>gofmt</code>, you can't configure it! This is very apparent when you read Golang code, it always looks the same! And it is pretty fucking fantastic if you ask me, because not only Golang is easy to learn, but you can quickly get used to any Golang codebase due to the consistent formatting of the language.</p>
<h2>Too many ways to do things</h2>
<p>Rust has a somewhat different syntax from other languages of its genre, and you sometimes see things that you might not be used to see (statement as expression, match statements, lifetimes, etc.) I couldn't care less about these, these are things you can learn, and you end up getting used to them. What I can't get used to is the sheer number of ways to do something. There are so many keywords in Rust, and there's so many ways to end up bike shedding on the best way to write the exact same statement, that I consider it a waste of time. It's a waste of time for the developers, but also for the reviewers who will often run into keywords that they've never seen before. For example, there are too many ways to panic on purpose: <code>panic!()</code>, <code>unwrap()</code>, <code>except()</code>, <code>unreachable!()</code>, <code>todo!()</code>, <code>unimplemented!()</code>, <code>assert!()</code>, and so on. </p>
<h2>Generics and macros</h2>
<p>Rust is too expressive. This is of course great for some use-cases, but holy shit if a developer wants to be too clever, they can create the most unintelligible codebase that you'll ever seen. This is probably the most controversial point, but security is not just safety, it's also readability. As we say "complexity is the enemy of security", and generics undeniably add complexity. This is of course up to the developers to abuse them, but the great thing about Golang is that there aren't many things to abuse, codebases are often straight forward and you can quickly understand what is happening.</p>
<h2>Ok, you're being unreasonable David</h2>
<p>Sure, I'm omitting a lot of good Rust things in here, but this is a post about the security downsides of Rust, not the upsides, which let's be clear still make Rust the perfect language to write a sensitive application in. You just need to know what you're doing. This also means that Rust has a lot of room to mature, while generics are here to stay, there is no excuse to keep slipping the shallow stdlib under the rug.</p>

<p>Real developers use the CLI, or so I’m told. That probably explains why I mostly use the portal experiences of the major cloud providers. But judging from the portal experiences offered by most clouds, they prefer you use the CLI too. <strong>So let’s look at the CLIs.</strong></p>



<p>Specifically, I evaluated the cloud CLIs with an eye on five different areas:</p>



<ol><li><strong>API surface and patterns.</strong> How much of the cloud was exposed via CLI, and is there a consistent way to interact with each service?</li><li><strong>Authentication.</strong> How do users identify themselves to the CLI, and can you maintain different user profiles?</li><li><strong>Creating and viewing services.</strong> What does it feel like to provision instances, and then browse those provisioned instances?</li><li><strong>CLI sweeteners.</strong> Are there things the CLI offers to make using it more delightful?</li><li><strong>Utilities. </strong>Does the CLI offer additional tooling that helps developers build or test their software?</li></ol>



<p>Let’s dig in.</p>



<p><em>Disclaimer: I work for Google Cloud, so obviously I’ll have some biases. That said, I’ve used AWS for over a decade, was an Azure MVP for years, and can be mostly fair when comparing products and services. Please call out any mistakes I make!</em></p>







<p>You have a few ways to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html">install the AWS CLI</a>. You can use a Docker image, or install directly on your machine. If you’re installing directly, you can download from AWS, or use your favorite package manager. AWS warns you that third party repos may not be up to date. I went ahead and installed the CLI on my Mac using <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/awscli#default">Homebrew</a>.</p>



<h3>API surface and patterns</h3>



<p>As you’d expect, the AWS CLI has <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/index.html">wide coverage</a>. Really wide. I think there’s an API in there to retrieve the name of Andy Jassy’s favorite jungle cat. The <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/ec2/index.html">EC2 commands</a> alone could fill a book. The documentation is comprehensive, with detailed summaries of parameters, and example invocations.</p>



<p>The command patterns are <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-commandstructure.html">relatively consistent</a>, with some disparities between older services and newer ones. Most service commands look like:</p>



<pre>aws [service name] [action] [parameters]</pre>



<p>Most “actions” start with create, delete, describe, get, list, or update.</p>



<p>For example:</p>



<pre>aws elasticache create-cache-cluster --engine redis
aws kinesis describe-stream --stream-name seroter-stream
aws kinesis describe-stream --stream-name seroter-stream
aws qldb delete-ledger --name seroterledger
aws sqs list-queues</pre>



<p>S3 is one of the original AWS services, and <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3/index.html">its API is different</a>. It uses commands like <code>cp</code>, <code>ls</code>, and <code>rm</code>. Some services have <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/elasticache/index.html">modify</a> commands, others use <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/eks/index.html">update</a>. For the most part, it’s intuitive, but I’d imagine most people can’t guess the commands.</p>



<h3>Authentication</h3>



<p>There isn’t one way to authenticate to the AWS CLI. You might <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sso.html">use SSO</a>, an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sourcing-external.html">external file</a>, or inline <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html">access key and ID</a>, like I do below.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="8394" data-permalink="https://seroter.com/2020-09-15-cli-01/" data-orig-file="https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-01.png" data-orig-size="600,166" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="2020.09.15-cli-01" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-01.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-01.png?w=600" src="https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-01.png?w=600" alt="" srcset="https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-01.png 600w, https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-01.png?w=150 150w, https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-01.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></figure>



<p>The CLI supports “<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html#cli-configure-quickstart-profiles">profiles</a>” which seems important when you may have different access to default values based on what you’re working on.</p>



<h3>Creating and viewing service instances</h3>



<p>By default, everything the CLI does occurs in the region of the active profile. You can override the default region by passing in a region flag to each command. See below that I created a new SQS queue without providing a region, and it dropped it into my default one (us-west-2). By explicitly passing in a target region, I created the second queue elsewhere.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="8397" data-permalink="https://seroter.com/2020-09-15-cli-02/" data-orig-file="https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-02.png" data-orig-size="600,160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="2020.09.15-cli-02" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-02.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-02.png?w=600" src="https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-02.png?w=600" alt="" srcset="https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-02.png 600w, https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-02.png?w=150 150w, https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-02.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></figure>



<p>The AWS Console shows you resources for a selected region. I don’t see obvious ways to get an all-up view. A few services, like S3, aren’t bound by region, and you see all resources at once. The CLI behaves the same. I can’t view all my SQS queues, or databases, or whatever, from around the world. I can “list” the items, region by region. Deletion behaves the same. I can’t delete the above SQS queue without providing a region flag, even though the URL is region-specific. </p>



<p>Overall, it’s fast and straightforward to provision, update, and list AWS services using the CLI. Just keep the region-by-region perspective in mind!</p>



<h3>CLI sweeteners</h3>



<p>The AWS CLI gives you control over the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-output.html">output format</a>. I set the default for my profile to json, but you can also do yaml, text, and table. You can toggle this on a request by request basis.</p>



<p>You can also take advantage of <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-completion.html">command completion</a>. This is handy, given how tricky it may be to guess the exact syntax of a command. Similarly, I really like you can be <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-prompting.html">prompted for parameters</a>. Instead of guessing, or creating giant strings, you can go parameter by parameter in a guided manner.</p>



<p>The AWS CLI also offers select opportunities to interact with the resources themselves. I can <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/sqs/send-message.html">send and receive</a> SQS messages. Or <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/dynamodb/put-item.html">put an item</a> directly into a DynamoDB table. There are a handful of services that let you create/update/delete data in the resource, but many are focused solely on the lifecycle of the resource itself.</p>



<p>Finally, I don’t see a way to self-update from within the CLI itself. It looks like you rely on your package manager or re-download to refresh it. If I’m wrong, tell me!</p>



<h3>Utilities</h3>



<p>It doesn’t look like the CLI ships with other tools that developers might use to build apps for AWS.</p>







<p>The Microsoft Azure CLI also has broad coverage and is <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest">well documented</a>. There’s no shortage of examples, and it clearly explains how to use each command.</p>



<p>Like AWS, Microsoft offers their <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/run-azure-cli-docker?view=azure-cli-latest">CLI in a Docker image</a>. They also offer <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest">direct downloads</a>, or access via a package manager. I grabbed mine from <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/azure-cli#default">Homebrew</a>.</p>



<h3>API surface and patterns</h3>



<p>The CLI supports <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest">almost every major Azure service.</a> Some, like Logic Apps or Blockchain, only show up in their experimental sandbox. </p>



<p>Commands follow a particular syntax:</p>



<pre>az [service name] [object] create | list | delete | update [parameters]</pre>



<p>Let’s look at a few examples:</p>



<pre>az ad app create --display-name my-ad-app
az cosmosdb list --resource-group group1
az postgres db show --name mydb --resource-group group1 --server-name myserver
az service bus queue delete --name myqueue --namespace-name mynamespace --resource-group group1</pre>



<p>I haven’t observed much inconsistency in the CLI commands. They all seem to follow the same basic patterns.</p>



<h3>Authentication</h3>



<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?view=azure-cli-latest#az_login">Logging into the CLI </a>is easy. You can simply do <code>az login</code> as I did below—this opens a browser window and has you sign into your Azure account to retrieve a token—or you can pass in credentials. Those credentials may be a username/password, service principal with a secret, or service principal with a client certificate.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="8399" data-permalink="https://seroter.com/2020-09-15-cli-03/" data-orig-file="https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-03.png" data-orig-size="600,502" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="2020.09.15-cli-03" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-03.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-03.png?w=600" src="https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-03.png?w=600" alt="" srcset="https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-03.png 600w, https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-03.png?w=150 150w, https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-03.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></figure>



<p>Once you log in, you see all your Azure subscriptions. You can parse the JSON to see which one is active, and will be used as the default. If you wish to change the default, you can use <code>az account set --subscription [name]</code> to pick a different one. </p>



<p>There doesn’t appear to be a way to create different local profiles.</p>



<h3>Creating and viewing service instances</h3>



<p>It seems that most everything you create in Azure goes into a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview">resource group</a>. While a resource group has a “location” property, that’s related to the metadata, not a restriction on what gets deployed into it. You can set a default resource group (<code>az configure --defaults group=[name]</code>) or provide the relevant input parameter on each request.</p>



<p>Unlike other clouds, <a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/aws-azure-gcp-resource-hierarchies-25b829127511">Azure has a lot of nesting</a>. You have a root account, then a subscription, and then a resource group. And most resources also have parent-child relationships you must define before you can actually build the thing you want. </p>



<p>For example, if you want a service bus queue, you first create a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/servicebus/namespace?view=azure-cli-latest">namespace</a>. You can’t create both at the same time. It’s two calls. Want a storage blob to upload videos into? Create a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/storage/account?view=azure-cli-latest">storage account</a> first. A web application to run your .NET app? Provision a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/appservice/plan?view=azure-cli-latest">plan</a>. Serverless function? Create a plan. This doesn’t apply to everything, but just be aware that there are often multiple steps involved.</p>



<p>The creation activity itself is fairly simple. Here are commands to create Service Bus namespace and then a queue</p>



<pre>az servicebus namespace create --resource-group mydemos --name seroter-demos --location westus
az servicebus queue create --resource-group mydemos --namespace-name seroter-demos --name myqueue</pre>



<p>Like with AWS, some Azure assets get grouped by region. With Service Bus, namespaces are associated to a geo. I don’t see a way to query all queues, regardless of region. But for the many that aren’t, you get a view of all resources across the globe. After I created a couple Redis caches in my resource group, a simple <code>az redis list --resource-group mydemos</code> showed me caches in two different parts of the US.</p>



<p>Depending on how you use resource groups—maybe per app or per project, or even by team—just be aware that the CLI doesn’t retrieve results across resource groups. I’m not sure the best strategy for viewing subscription-wide resources other than the Azure Portal.</p>



<h3>CLI sweeteners</h3>



<p>The Azure CLI has some handy things to make it easier to use. </p>



<p>There’s a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?view=azure-cli-latest#az_find">find function</a> for figuring out commands. There’s <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/format-output-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest">output formatting</a> to json, tables, or yaml. You’ll also find a useful <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/interactive-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest">interactive mode</a> to get auto-completion, command examples, and more. Finally, I like that the Azure CLI supports <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?view=azure-cli-latest#az_upgrade">self-upgrade</a>. Why leave the CLI if you don’t have to?</p>



<h3>Utilities</h3>



<p>I noticed a few things in this CLI that help developers. First, there’s an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?view=azure-cli-latest#az_rest">az rest</a> command that lets you call Azure service endpoints with authentication headers taken care of for you. That’s a useful tool for calling secured endpoints.</p>



<p>Azure offers a wide array of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview?view=azure-cli-latest">extensions</a> to the CLI. These aren’t shipped as part of the CLI itself, but you can easily bolt them on. And you can create your own. This is a fluid list, but <code>az extension list-available</code> shows you what’s in the pool right now. As of this writing, there are extensions for preview AKS capabilities, managing Azure DevOps, working with DataBricks, using Azure LogicApps, querying the Azure Resource Graph, and more.</p>







<p>I’ve only recently started seriously using the GCP CLI. What’s struck me most about the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud">gcloud</a> tool is that it feels more like a system—dare I say, …</p></div></article></div>

<p>Postgres 13 is almost here. It's been in beta since May, and the general availability release is
coming any day. We've been following Postgres 13 closely here at pganalyze, and have been running
the beta in one of our staging environments for several months now.</p>
<p>There are no big new features in Postgres 13, but there are a lot of small but important incremental
improvements. Let's take a look.</p>

<h2 id="performance"><a href="#performance" aria-label="performance permalink"></a>Performance</h2>
<p>Postgres 13 performance improvements include both built-in optimizations and heuristics that will make
your database run better out of the box, as well as additional features to give you more flexibility
in optimizing your schema and queries.</p>

<p>Postgres 13 introduces a way for B-Tree indexes to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/btree-implementation.html#BTREE-DEDUPLICATION">avoid storing duplicate entries in some situations</a>.
In general, a B-Tree index consists of a tree of indexed values, with each leaf node pointing to a
particular row version. Because each leaf points to one row version, if you are indexing non-unique
values, those values need to be repeated.</p>
<p>The de-duplication mechanism avoids that by having a leaf node point to several row versions if possible,
which leads to smaller indexes.</p>
<p>Here is an example from our own pganalyze application schema: We have a <code>queries</code> table to
track all the queries we monitor, and a <code>database_id</code> field to track which database they belong to. We
index <code>database_id</code> (so we can quickly fetch queries for a specific database), and because each database
typically has more than one query, there is a lot of duplication in this index.</p>
<p>New B-Tree indexes in Postgres 13 use the deduplication feature by default, but if for some reason,
you need to turn it off, you can control it with the <code>deduplicate_items</code> storage parameter. Here we
create the same index in two different ways, with deduplication explicitly on and off (though again,
you don't need to specify <code>on</code>—this is the default):</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> CONCURRENTLY queries_db_id_idx_no_dedup <span>ON</span> queries<span>(</span>database_id<span>)</span>
<span>WITH</span> <span>(</span>deduplicate_items<span>=</span><span>off</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> CONCURRENTLY queries_db_id_idx_yes_dedup <span>ON</span> queries<span>(</span>database_id<span>)</span>
<span>WITH</span> <span>(</span>deduplicate_items<span>=</span><span>on</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>SELECT</span> relname<span>,</span> pg_size_pretty<span>(</span>pg_relation_size<span>(</span>oid<span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>FROM</span> pg_class
<span>WHERE</span> relname <span>IN</span> <span>(</span><span>'queries_db_id_idx_no_dedup'</span><span>,</span> <span>'queries_db_id_idx_yes_dedup'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>           relname           | pg_size_pretty 
-----------------------------+----------------
 queries_db_id_idx_no_dedup  | 218 MB
 queries_db_id_idx_yes_dedup | 67 MB
(2 rows)</code></pre></div>
<p>With deduplication, the new index is more than <strong>three times smaller</strong>! Smaller indexes are faster to load
from disk, and take up less space in memory, meaning there's more room for your data.</p>
<p>One interesting note here is that the index entries point to row <em>versions</em> (as in, a row the way it
exists in one specific <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/mvcc.html">MVCC</a> state), not rows themselves,
so this feature <strong>can improve index size even for unique indexes</strong>, where one would not expect any duplication
to occur.</p>
<p>Note that deduplication is not possible in all cases (see above link for details), and that you
will need to reindex before you can take advantage of it if upgrading via <code>pg_upgrade</code>.</p>
<h3 id="extended-statistics-improvements-in-postgres-13"><a href="#extended-statistics-improvements-in-postgres-13" aria-label="extended statistics improvements in postgres 13 permalink"></a>Extended Statistics Improvements in Postgres 13</h3>
<p>Postgres 10 introduced the concept of <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/planner-stats.html#PLANNER-STATS-EXTENDED">extended statistics</a>. Postgres keeps some statistics about the "shape" of your data to ensure it can plan queries efficiently,
but the statistics kept by default cannot track things like inter-column dependencies. Extended statistics
were introduced to address that: These are database objects (like indexes) that you create manually with
<code>CREATE STATISTICS</code> to give the query planner more information for more specific situations. These would be
expensive for Postgres to determine automatically, but armed with an understanding of the semantics of your
schema, you can provide that additional info. Used carefully, this can lead to
<a href="https://build.affinity.co/how-we-used-postgres-extended-statistics-to-achieve-a-3000x-speedup-ea93d3dcdc61">massive performance improvements</a>.</p>
<p>Postgres 13 brings a number of small but important improvements to extended statistics, including
support for using them with <code>OR</code> clauses and in <code>IN</code>/<code>ANY</code> constant lists, allowing consideration
of multiple extended statistics objects in planning a query, and support for
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/sql-alterstatistics.html">setting a statistics target</a> for
extended statistics:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>ALTER</span> <span>STATISTICS</span> table_stx <span>SET</span> <span>STATISTICS</span> <span>1000</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Like with the regular statistics target, this is a trade-off between additional planning time (and longer <code>ANALYZE</code> runs), versus having more precise plans. We recommend using this in a targeted manner using EXPLAIN plans to confirm plan changes.</p>
<h3 id="parallel-vacuum--better-support-for-append-only-workloads"><a href="#parallel-vacuum--better-support-for-append-only-workloads" aria-label="parallel vacuum  better support for append only workloads permalink"></a>Parallel VACUUM &amp; Better Support for Append-only Workloads</h3>
<p>Postgres multi-version concurrency control means you need to run <code>VACUUM</code> regularly (usually you can rely
on the autovacuum process, though it may need some tuning). In Postgres 13, one notable improvement is
that multiple indexes for a single table can be vacuumed in parallel. This can lead to big performance
improvements in <code>VACUUM</code> work. Parallel <code>VACUUM</code> is the default and can be controlled with the <code>PARALLEL</code> option:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code>VACUUM <span>(</span>PARALLEL <span>2</span><span>,</span> VERBOSE<span>)</span> queries<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>INFO:  vacuuming "public.queries"
INFO:  launched 2 parallel vacuum workers for index vacuuming (planned: 2)
INFO:  scanned index "index_queries_on_database_id" to remove 1403418 row versions by parallel vacuum worker
DETAIL:  CPU: user: 0.98 s, system: 0.15 s, elapsed: 2.37 s
INFO:  scanned index "index_queries_on_last_occurred_at" to remove 1403418 row versions by parallel vacuum worker
DETAIL:  CPU: user: 0.88 s, system: 0.27 s, elapsed: 2.60 s
...</code></pre></div>
<p>Parallel VACUUM occurs when the following is true:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sufficient parallel workers are available, based on the system-wide limit set by <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-MAX-PARALLEL-WORKERS-MAINTENANCE"><code>max_parallel_maintenance_workers</code></a> (defaults to 2)</li>
<li>There are multiple indexes on the table (one index can be processed by one worker at a time)</li>
<li>Index types support it (all built-in index types support parallelism to some extent)</li>
<li>The indexes are large enough to exceed <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/runtime-config-query.html#GUC-MIN-PARALLEL-INDEX-SCAN-SIZE"><code>min_parallel_index_scan_size</code></a> (defaults to 512 kB)</li>
</ul>
<p>Be aware that <strong>parallel VACUUM is currently not supported for autovacuum.</strong> This new feature is intended for use in manual VACUUM runs that need to complete quickly, such as when insufficient autovacuum tuning has lead to an imminent TXID wraparound, and you need to intervene to fix it.</p>
<p>On that note, an important <code>autovacuum</code> improvement in Postgres 13 is that the autovacuum background process can now be triggered by <code>INSERT</code> statements for append-only tables. The main purpose of VACUUM is to clean up old versions of updated and deleted rows, but it is also essential to set pages as all-visible for MVCC bookkeeping. All-visible pages allow index-only scans to avoid checking visibility status row-by-row, making them faster.</p>
<p>We make extensive use of append-only tables at pganalyze for our timeseries data, and this improvement will make our lives considerably easier, avoiding the occasional manual VACUUM run on these tables. This new behavior can be controlled by the <code>autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold</code> and <code>autovacuum_vacuum_insert_scale_factor</code> variables.</p>
<h3 id="incremental-sorting"><a href="#incremental-sorting" aria-label="incremental sorting permalink"></a>Incremental Sorting</h3>
<p>Sorting data is a common database task, and Postgres has a number of features to avoid unnecessary work
here. For example, if you have a B-Tree index on a column, and you query your table ordered by that column,
it can just scan that index in order to get sorted data.</p>
<p>In Postgres 13, this is improved to handle partially sorted data. If you have an index on <code>(a, b)</code> (or
the data is already sorted by <code>(a, b)</code> for another reason), and you issue a query to order by <code>(a, b, c)</code>,
Postgres understands that the input data is already partially sorted, and can avoid re-sorting the whole
dataset. This is especially useful if you have a <code>LIMIT</code> in your query, since this can avoid even more
work.</p>
<h2 id="monitoring"><a href="#monitoring" aria-label="monitoring permalink"></a>Monitoring</h2>
<p>Monitoring improvements in Postgres 13 include more details on <code>WAL</code> usage, more options for logging your
queries, and more information on query planning.</p>
<h3 id="wal-usage-stats"><a href="#wal-usage-stats" aria-label="wal usage stats permalink"></a>WAL Usage Stats</h3>
<p>The write-ahead log (<code>WAL</code>) ensures your data stays consistent in the event of a crash, even mid-write. Consistency
is a fundamental property of databases—it ensures your transaction either committed or did not commit; you don't
have to worry about in-between states. But on a busy system, <code>WAL</code> writes can often be a bottleneck. To help
diagnose this, Postgres 13 includes more information on <code>WAL</code> usage from your queries.</p>
<p><code>EXPLAIN</code> now supports information about <code>WAL</code> records generated during execution:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>EXPLAIN</span> <span>(</span><span>ANALYZE</span><span>,</span> WAL<span>)</span> <span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span> users<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>                                                    QUERY PLAN                                                     
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Delete on users  (cost=0.00..5409.00 rows=100000 width=6) (actual time=108.910..108.911 rows=0 loops=1)
   WAL: records=100000 fpi=741 bytes=11425721
   -&gt;  Seq Scan on users  (cost=0.00..5409.00 rows=100000 width=6) (actual time=8.519..51.850 rows=100000 loops=1)
 Planning Time: 6.083 ms
 Execution Time: 108.955 ms
(5 rows)</code></pre></div>
<p>You can see that the <code>WAL</code> line includes the number of records generated, the number of full page images (fpi), and
the number of <code>WAL</code> bytes generated. Only non-zero values are printed in the default text format.</p>
<p>This is also available in <code>pg_stat_statements</code>. For example, on our staging environment, here is what we ran to get
the statement that produced the most <code>WAL</code> records:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> query<span>,</span> calls<span>,</span> wal_records<span>,</span> wal_fpi<span>,</span> wal_bytes <span>FROM</span> pg_stat_statements
  <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> wal_records <span>DESC</span> <span>LIMIT</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>-[ RECORD 1 ]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
query       | CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE upsert_data (server_id uuid NOT NULL, backend_id uuid NOT NULL,
            | query_start timestamp NOT NULL, query_fingerprint bytea NOT NULL, query_text text NOT NULL)
calls       | 7974948
wal_records | 966960816
wal_fpi     | 1018412
wal_bytes   | 100086092097</code></pre></div>
<p>Like many other values in <code>pg_stat_statements</code>, the <code>wal_records</code>, <code>wal_fpi</code>, and <code>wal_bytes</code> values here are
cumulative since the last <code>pg_stat_statements_reset</code> call.</p></div></div></div>

The spectrum runs from quick to slow return on investments of nutrients and dry mass in leaves, and operates largely independently of growth form, plant functional type or biome. Categories along the spectrum would, in general, describe leaf economic variation at the global scale better than plant functional types, because functional types overlap substantially in their leaf traits. Overall, modulation of leaf traits and trait relationships by climate is surprisingly modest, although some striking and significant patterns can be seen. Reliable quantification of the leaf economics spectrum and its interaction with climate will prove valuable for modelling nutrient fluxes and vegetation boundaries under changing land-use and climate.Green leaves are fundamental for the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Their pigments are the predominant signal seen from space. Nitrogen uptake and carbon assimilation by plants and the decomposability of leaves drive biogeochemical cycles. Animals, fungi and other heterotrophs in ecosystems are fuelled by photosynthate, and their habitats are structured by the stems on which leaves are deployed. Plants invest photosynthate and mineral nutrients in the construction of leaves, which in turn return a revenue stream of photosynthate over their lifetimes. The photosynthate is used to acquire mineral nutrients, to support metabolism and to re-invest in leaves, their supporting stems and other plant parts.There are more than 250,000 vascular plant species, all engaging in the same processes of investment and reinvestment of carbon and mineral nutrients, and all making enough surplus to ensure continuity to future generations. These processes of investment and re-investment are inherently economic in nature [1][2][3] . Understanding how these processes vary between species, plant functional types and the vegetation of different biomes is a major goal for plant ecology and crucial for modelling how nutrient fluxes and vegetation boundaries will shift with land-use and climate change.
Data set and parametersWe formed a global plant trait network (Glopnet) to quantify leaf economics across the world's plant species. The Glopnet data set spans 2,548 species from 219 families at 175 sites (approximately 1% of the extant vascular plant species). The coverage of traits, species and sites is at least tenfold greater than previous data compilations [4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11] , extends to all vegetated continents, and represents a wide range of vegetation types, from arctic tundra to tropical rainforest, from hot to cold deserts, from boreal forest to grasslands. Site elevation ranges from below sea level (Death Valley, USA) to 4,800 m. Mean annual temperature (MAT) ranges from 216.5 8C to 27.5 8C; mean annual rainfall (MAR) ranges from 133 to 5,300 mm per year.

The perceived behavioural control (PBC) construct accounted for significant amounts of variance in intention and behaviour, independent of theory of reasoned action variables. When behaviour measures were self-reports, the TPB accounted for 11% more of the variance in behaviour than when behaviour measures were objective or observed (R2s = .31 and .21, respectively). Attitude, subjective norm and PBC account for significantly more of the variance in individuals' desires than intentions or self-predictions, but intentions and self-predictions were better predictors of behaviour. The subjective norm construct is generally found to be a weak predictor of intentions. This is partly attributable to a combination of poor measurement and the need for expansion of the normative component.

            <p>“Our results indicate that public immunity to COVID-19 is probably significantly higher than antibody tests have suggested,” says Professor <a href="https://staff.ki.se/people/hanlju">Hans-Gustaf Ljunggren</a> at the Center for Infectious Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, and co-senior author. “If this is the case, it is of course very good news from a public health perspective.”</p>

<p>T-cell analyses are more complicated to perform than antibody tests and at present are therefore only done in specialised laboratories, such as that at the Center for Infectious Medicine at Karolinska Institutet.</p>

<p>“Larger and more longitudinal studies must now be done on both T cells and antibodies to understand how long-lasting the immunity is and how these different components of COVID-19 immunity are related,” says Marcus Buggert.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.29.174888v1">The results were first published on 29 June 2020 on a preprint server, bioRxiv</a> (see box) and a previous version of this news article was then published.

    <li><strong>Dynamic Scoping in C++</strong> </li>

    </ol>

           
  <p><i>Date: 2020-07-10</i></p><p>I always had a faible for dynamic scoping as it is implemented in
Common Lisp, Emacs Lisp, or LaTeX. To me, it seems that dynamic
scoping is an almost forgotten technique and dismissed technique in
modern programming. While it is more complex to understand and more
magically than lexical scoping, there are some applications that
benefit from dynamic scoping.</p>
<p>In lexical scoping, if you access a variable, your compiler will start
searching the declaration from the point of reference outwards in
lexical order. This means it searches first in the most inner scope,
and continoues to widen its search scope by the "closed-nested-scope
rule". For example, in the following code snippet, the call to <code>foo()</code>
would return 23, as the lexcially-closest declaration is the global variable.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>int</span> <span>config</span> <span>=</span> <span>23</span><span>;</span>

<span>return</span> <span>foo</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>config</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>void</span> <span>bar</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>config</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span><span>;</span>
    <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"%d</span><span>\"</span><span>, foo());</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>With dynamic scoping, the world would look different as the closest
(time-wise) dynamic binding for a given name is found instead of
lexically closest. In the example, <code>foo()</code> would return 42, as the
binding in <code>bar()</code> happened more recently that the global binding.</p>
<p>You can think of a dynamically-scoped global variable as shadowable
global binding. By creating a new binding for the variable, we shadow
the old binding, and all references in child functions will now refer
to the new binding, although they have not received the value via an
argument transfer. Ergo, dynamically-scoped variables are shadowable
side-channels that can influence the behavior of a function.</p>
<p>For example, in Common Lisp, the variable <code>*standard-output*</code> is
dynamically scoped and functions <code>(print)</code> simply send there
characters to that variable. As it is dynamically scoped, we can just
redirect all output to a file by creating a new binding for
<code>*standard-output*</code>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>with-open-file</span> <span>(</span><span>*standard-output*</span> <span>"somefile.dat"</span> <span>:direction</span> <span>:output</span>
                                   <span>:if-exists</span> <span>:supersede</span><span>)</span>
   <span>(</span><span>print</span> <span>"this goes into file"</span><span>))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Wouldn't it be neat to do the same in, let's say, C++? Luckily, with
templates, the RAII pattern, and some template magic, we can write
code like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>DynamicScope</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>G</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>

<span>void</span> <span>bar</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>cout</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"bar "</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>*</span><span>G</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>endl</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>void</span> <span>foo</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>DynamicScope</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;::</span><span>BindInstance</span> <span>_</span><span>(</span><span>G</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>);</span>
    <span>bar</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>cout</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"main1 "</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>*</span><span>G</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>endl</span><span>;</span>
    <span>foo</span><span>();</span>
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>cout</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"main2 "</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>*</span><span>G</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>endl</span><span>;</span>

<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>and end up with the output:</p>

</p>
<h2 id="update-23092020-multi-threaded-programs">[UPDATE 23.09.2020] Multi-Threaded Programs</h2>
<p>After some discussion on
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24544716">HackerNews</a> (which I
highly recommend to read), I was made aware that the previous
implementation has a problem with multi-threaded programs. As all
threads share the same global objects as a root to their dynamic-scope
value stack, bindings in one thread had an influence on the bindings
in another thread. Of coure, this would be a broken version of dynamic
scoping.</p>
<p>The problem can be circumvented by making the global variable thread local:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>thread_local</span> <span>DynamicScope</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>G</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>With this, every thread has its own version of the G object, which
internally is the head of a linked list of the shadowed values.
However, someone could forget the add the required thread_local attribute.</p>
<p>Unluckily, checking whether the storage class of a given variable is
thread_local is not that trivial. However, I came up with a rather
low-cost sanity check that ensures that a variable must be declared
<code>thread_local</code>. The updated version of <code>DynamicScope&lt;T&gt;</code>, as well as
some benchmarking code, can be found here:    <a href="https://blog.dokucode.de/posts/2020-07-10-Dynamic-Scoping-in-CPP/thread_dynamic_scope.cc">thread_dynamic_scope.cc</a>

    <p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/working-memory/3-basic-rules-of-productivity-cover.png" alt="3 Basic Rules Of Productivity Cover"></p>
<p>Have you ever wondered what happens inside our brain whenever we are thinking about something? How some people have great ideas, are able to learn fast, and are incredibly productive, while others are struggling with finalizing even a simple task? There are many components to this process, and in this article, you will learn about one of them.</p>
<p>Working Memory is one of the <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/blog/how-people-learn-memory-storage-types/">several memory types</a> where information is processed and manipulated before it is either discarded or committed to the long-term storage. Understanding its nuances can allow us to be more efficient in using it and be a bit more productive at what we do.</p>
<p>And since it is at the core of information processing by our brain, the things you are about to learn are independent of the domain you are working in.</p>
<h2 id="an-strikeirstrikerelevant-example-first">An <strike>Ir</strike>relevant Example First</h2>
<p>I don’t know how many articles online make you do exercises, but let’s do one right now. Moreover, I count on your integrity to follow the exercise’s directions since I cannot check you play by the rules.</p>
<h3 id="exercise-description">Exercise Description</h3>
<p>You will see below two blank boxes. Upon clicking on “Show Letters,” you will see two sequences (one after another) of random characters for 7 seconds each.</p>
<p><em>Rule # 1:</em> after you click on the button, you have 7 seconds to read and memorize the first sequence, and 7 seconds for the second one (the sequences will display automatically, you only have to click on the button once).
<em>Rule #2:</em> do not use any note-taking software (doc, excel, text editor, etc.) or hardware (pen and paper, pen and table, pen and walls; a pencil if fine though!). Well, you can, but you will miss the whole point of it.</p>

<p>abcdlmnowxyz</p>
<p>gdluwcemjroc</p>   
<p>Great! How it went? Sorry if you tried to click on a box the second time, and it didn’t show up. I put some sophisticated locking mechanisms in place to prevent that.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Now, there are two more boxes below. Click on each of them, input the characters you memorized, and see how good you have performed on the task.</p>
<div id="boxAnswer1">
    
    <div id="comparisonData1">
        <p>abcdlmnowxyz</p>
        <p>&lt;-- Original sequence</p>
    </div>
    
</div>
<div id="boxAnswer2">
    
    <div id="comparisonData2">
        <p>gdluwcemjroc</p>
        <p>&lt;-- Original sequence</p>
    </div>
    
</div>   
<p>If you got neither of them correctly, do not worry. 7 seconds is quite fast, and, as you will see next, the capacity of Working Memory is limited.</p>
<p>If you did remember only the first one, though, how did you do it? Most people usually memorize it as three distinct subsets: <code>abcd</code> <code>lmno</code> <code>wxyz</code>. It is relatively easy to remember it because of several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>instead of 12 units of information (characters, in this case), you had to memorize much less (3 letters and the length of the groups–4);</li>
<li>you have inherent knowledge about the alphabet (if you, dear reader, are older than 6 years);</li>
<li>you have advanced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_(psychology)">pattern recognition</a> abilities that help you discern and group units of information into collections;</li>
</ul>
<p>But what about the second sequence?</p>
<p>How did you attempt to memorize it? Maybe you have split the characters into chunks of 3 or 4 letters and tried to remember the groups, or perhaps you made words out of different adjacent letters and memorized those, or even you came up with a totally different strategy. Anyway, it is usually harder to remember the second sequence. And that is because the amount of information exceeded the capacity of our Working Memory. You had to memorize 12 units of information (or had to search anxiously for some associations to find a way to group those letters), while you have much less space to process at once in such a short period of time.</p>
<p>Let’s do one more similar exercise, but this time with numbers.</p>

<p>193919451969</p>
<p>826492104350</p>   
<p>How did it go? You can verify your answers below.</p>
<div id="boxAnswer3">
    
    <div id="comparisonData3">
        <p>193919451969</p>
        <p>&lt;-- Original sequence</p>
    </div>
    
</div>
<div id="boxAnswer4">
    
    <div id="comparisonData4">
        <p>826492104350</p>
        <p>&lt;-- Original sequence</p>
    </div>
    
</div>   

   
<p>There are two main approaches to store the first sequence of digits. The first is to combine them by 2, getting 19, 39, 19, 45, 19, and 69. You have 19 repeating three times, a 39 and 69 that are divisible by three, and a 45 that you just have to remember. But this approach is suboptimal. A more efficient one is to group them by four and use some knowledge of history. You can represent that sequence as three numbers: <code>1939</code>, <code>1945</code>, and <code>1969</code>. The first two are the start and end of the Second World War, and the third is the year of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11">Apollo 11 moon landing</a>. So you just need to remember three chunks of information rather than 12. It is another demonstrative example that shows how our brain not only seeks to encode and compress information (as in the previous example with the first character sequence), but also it heavily relies on existing knowledge (as in the case with the WWII and moon landing years). The approaches you take may also vary in their efficiency.</p>
<p>The second one does not have any specific pattern to follow. Maybe you divided the sequence into groups of two or three or even four digits, or perhaps you tried to find a rule to group them. For instance, 82 add up to 10, then 64 add up to 10, but it’s not consistent. You’ll arrive at 92, and it doesn’t add up to 10. The approaches can be very different here, but the conclusion is the same - the second sequence is harder to remember because there is no exact rule or compression algorithm that would facilitate the remembering.</p>
<h2 id="the-working-memory-capacity">The Working Memory Capacity</h2>
<p>We saw that it is hard to memorize a sequence of 12 items, which implies that its capacity should be smaller than that, as otherwise, you would effortlessly remember those 12 pieces of information. But how <strike>big</strike> small is it?</p>
<p>The first quantification of the working memory capacity was provided in 1956 in a paper by George A. Miller titled: <em>“The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information."</em> It is one of the most highly cited papers in psychology<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> with over 33400 papers that cited it (at the time of writing), according to <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=The+magical+number+seven%2C+plus+or+minus+two%3A+Some+limits+on+our+capacity+for+processing+information.&amp;btnG=">Google Scholar</a>. In his paper, Miller claims the working memory capacity to be 7±2 “chunks,” to which I’ll get shortly.</p>
<p>But since 1956, the Working Memory was actively researched and studied, and other theories of its capacity emerged. One such prominent hypothesis is that of Nelson Cowan, who in 2001 published the paper titled <em>“The magical number 4 in short-term memory: A reconsideration of mental storage capacity,"</em> in which, you guessed, he suggests a smaller capacity of <em>four chunks.</em></p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-chunk-anyway">What Is A Chunk Anyway?</h2>
<p>Since we can store a very limited amount of chunks in the Working Memory for processing, how does one define a <em>chunk?</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no concrete answer to this question because it is a relative measure that depends on the type of information and the pre-existing knowledge of the person who operates with it.</p>
<p>It can vary greatly:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are not familiar with the Russian language, the sequence <code>плюшечка</code> would result in a chunk being the size of an individual letter (or even less), since you don’t have implicit knowledge about it. However, it would represent a single chunk for a Russian speaking person since it is a real word (in a diminutive form).</li>
<li>Distinct words such as <em>job, emotion, productivity</em> may represent single chunks.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></li>
<li>Combinations of words like <em>“The Fellowship Of The Ring,” “The Two Towers,” “The Return Of The King”</em> can also be considered individual chunks.</li>
<li>Entire sentences can also represent chunks: “Today, I went to the seaside.” or “I am a responsible citizen, and I will vote.”</li>
<li>When thinking about them holistically, even entire chapters and books may represent single chunks, as in the Lord Of The Rings trilogy mentioned above.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, there is no exact size for a chunk, as it depends on different factors, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>familiarity with the topic;</li>
<li>complexity of the concept;</li>
<li>one’s mental agility;</li>
</ul>
<p>But chunks are not represented only by words on paper or screen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chess players store groups of pieces together when they are asked to reproduce a chess arrangement from memory onto an empty chessboard.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Therefore, a chunk represents the position of several figures at once.</li>
<li>Solving a simple math equation like <code>8 * 3 - 42 / 2 = ?</code> requires an iterative approach to load the operands with the highest priority (8 and 3) and the operation to perform (multiplication), then solve that simple equation and store the result in the WM (24), repeat with next pair of operands (42 / 2), hold the result (21), and finally, repeat one more time, by accessing the results of the two simple operations in the WM and doing the subtraction (24 - 21) to get 3.</li>
<li>Attending a meeting requires keeping different presented ideas in mind to reason about them, make connections with one’s own thoughts, or doing tons of other stuff with them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="navigating-the-hierarchical-structure-of-information-within-a-complex-network-of-associations">Navigating The Hierarchical Structure Of Information Within A Complex Network Of Associations</h2>
<p>You might wonder how a chunk may be represented by a single word as well as a whole book? After all, the amount of information differs immensely.</p>
<p>The idea here is how data is represented in our long-term memory and the agility of our Working Memory to combine information. The processes I have described run seamlessly and fast. When we read a sentence (not a random list of words), we expect a specific structure that we are very good at understanding. We know there is usually an action, an object, and a subject in a sentence.</p>
<p>So, when we read words, our Working Memory combines parts of the sentence into chunks and stores them in one of the four available memory slots. Then, once you are done reading a sentence, WM extracts all the relevant pieces that belong to the sentence you just read, combines them into a <em>superchunk,</em> and stores it in a single memory slot or even enter it into the long-term memory. Once you have read a paragraph, you combine several sentence superchunks into one, store it, and repeat the entire process. You thus create a hierarchy of information.</p>

If the blood-brain barrier is breached, then health problems arise.</p><p>Now, in a study with potential impacts on a variety of neurological diseases, Virginia Tech researchers have provided the first experimental evidence from a living organism to show that an abundant, star-shaped brain cell known as an astrocyte is essential for blood-brain barrier health.</p><p>The research in today’s online edition of the journal <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fonlinelibrary.wiley.com%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1002%2Fglia.23908&amp;t=MjM2NGY2MWFmNGRhNDJhNDBhZDJkNjBkZjMyOGI4MDUyZjU2YzMyMixRRldXZFhKcg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F629877618586615808%2Fblood-brain-barrier-health&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1600995938"><i>GLIA</i></a> reassesses traditional claims about the role of astrocytes in the brain and confirms the long-held assumption — although it had been recently disputed — that astrocytes support the blood-brain barrier.</p><p>Furthermore, the finding gives scientists a path to understand diseases where frequent blood-brain barrier damage occurs, including traumatic brain injury, stroke, epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease.</p><p>“Blood-brain barrier leakage is a problem in the aging brain as well as many different neurological diseases,” said Stefanie Robel, an assistant professor at the <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Ffbri.vtc.vt.edu%2F&amp;t=MTNmYmRhMDQ1MTY0YzFkZThhM2FiNDc3YzgzMTNmMDU0OGM2ZGI3YyxRRldXZFhKcg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F629877618586615808%2Fblood-brain-barrier-health&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1600995938">Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC</a> and the study’s senior author. “Without astrocytes, the blood-brain barrier becomes leaky and ineffective, leaving brain tissue vulnerable to a variety of medical conditions. If we know what maintains the barrier in the healthy brain, we will be able to better understand what goes wrong in traumatic brain injury and in Alzheimer’s disease — all health problems with blood-brain barrier damage.”</p><p>Generally, researchers suspect astrocytes support the blood-brain barrier by releasing factors helpful to maintaining tight connections between the cells in the barrier. </p><p>In the new study, scientists with the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute genetically ablated a small number of astrocytes in adult mice to determine if the cells were necessary for blood-brain barrier health.</p><p>The researchers used small, intermediate-sized, and large molecular tracers to evaluate the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. All of the markers passed through the barrier in some areas, while in other areas only small tracers leaked, suggesting that leakages were happening at various sizes. </p><p>“We now have great tools to learn about what astrocytes really do in the adult brain,” said Robel, who is also an assistant professor in Virginia Tech’s <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fneuroscience.vt.edu%2F&amp;t=ZmIzYzkyMmZjZDYyMWMyMGIzZDQzNmI0MGMwYzRhYWNkODBkMGZkOSxRRldXZFhKcg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F629877618586615808%2Fblood-brain-barrier-health&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1600995938">School of Neuroscience</a>. “It’s possible that those leaks weren’t detected in previous studies.”</p><p>In recent years, contradictory studies have emerged in which scientists removed astrocytes in animal models with no indications of harm to the blood-brain barrier. </p><p>However, when Virginia Tech scientists used a mouse model to mimic the effect of the removal of astrocytes, varying degrees of permanent blood-brain barrier damage occurred, with the amount of damage possibly in proportion with the numbers of ablated astrocytes. In these scenarios, the scientists determined neighboring astrocytes do not rescue the blood-brain barrier when it is damaged.</p><p>The research began after the scientists challenged commonly accepted statements in neuroscience.</p><p>“I would read a review article that would say astrocytes maintain the blood-brain barrier in the adult healthy brain, but rarely was it followed by a citation that would show direct evidence of that fact,” said Benjamin Heithoff, the first author of the study and a graduate student who conducts research in the <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Ffbri.vtc.vt.edu%2Fresearch%2Flabs%2Frobel.html&amp;t=MTUwZDViNWZhZjEwZTBjZTk2ZmIzMGM5YzA0MmNkMTE3NmIxNWVmZSxRRldXZFhKcg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F629877618586615808%2Fblood-brain-barrier-health&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1600995938">Robel lab</a> at the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute.</p><figure data-orig-width="1024" data-orig-height="749"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/c316d47571b9a7301d48f0fb4d99e527/d76379001588b933-da/s1280x1920/131824229863137bb74ac5697096e322b775c0cf.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1024" data-orig-height="749" width="1024" height="749"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;Brain cells called astrocytes appear in green, and purple represents the leakage of the blood-brain barrier.

"Assumptions can be held for a long time, and it takes studies like ours, with more sensitive tools, to re-evaluate them.

In cases of traumatic brain injury or concussion, the blood-brain barrier breakdown that can occur is associated with higher risk for lifelong consequences, including cognitive decline and permanent motor deficits.</p><p>“When people sustain a concussion, we used to consider this a ‘minor injury.’ But our follow-up study shows that the blood-brain barrier leakage persists in areas where astrocytes are not functioning correctly, which suggests there is a long-term, lasting dysfunction in the barrier,” said Heithoff, who is with the Department of Biological Sciences of the <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.science.vt.edu%2Findex.html&amp;t=YmQzYzY0ODVjZTI3MGMxYTU2Yzc2YTFjY2NiMzU1OTkwNGZiMDI4OSxRRldXZFhKcg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F629877618586615808%2Fblood-brain-barrier-health&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1600995938">College of Science</a>. “Understanding how that problem occurs and how it can be remedied are important public health questions.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
<p>How much should we charge for our product? What's the price model that makes sense to our users? We had a long discussion about it and we looked to consider all the important aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li><a onclick="document.getElementById ('1whatpricemakesourproductsustainable').scrollIntoView ()">What price makes our product sustainable?</a></li>
<li><a onclick="document.getElementById ('2isthisapriceouruserswillbewillingtopay').scrollIntoView ()">What price are users willing to pay?</a></li>
<li><a onclick="document.getElementById ('3thismodelservesourusers').scrollIntoView ()">What price model best serves our users?</a></li>
<li><a onclick="document.getElementById ('4aretheredisadvantagestothismodel').scrollIntoView ()">Are there disadvantages to this model?</a></li>
</ol>
<p>By answering these questions, we’ll be better equipped to have a solid pricing model to begin the journey of our first product: <a href="https://altocode.nl/pic/" target="_blank"> ac;pic</a>, a photo and video organization service.</p>
<p>Here's the entire process we went through.</p>
<h2 id="1whatpricemakesourproductsustainable">1. What price makes our product sustainable?</h2>
<p>There's one inescapable fact: if the product is not profitable, we can't pay ourselves and cover the costs. If that happens, there's no company, no product, no team.</p>
<p>We began with 2 straightforward questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><a onclick="document.getElementById ('1howmuchdoweneedtopayourselves').scrollIntoView ()">How much do we need to pay ourselves?</a></li>
<li><a onclick="document.getElementById ('2howmuchdoesitcosttomaintaintheserviceandthecompany').scrollIntoView ()">How much does it cost to maintain the service and the company?</a></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="1howmuchdoweneedtopayourselves">1. How much do we need to pay ourselves?</h4>
<p>If we can't support ourselves, we can't make any of this happen. Conversely, if a project that we love and believe in can pay our salaries, it will grow and prosper with our full attention.</p>
<p>Altocode works in full transparency, which means everybody can see everything we <a href="https://github.com/altocodenl" target="_blank">do,</a> we <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1otweqrARCHe2u6DeHW3FDZmug0L1Wd6p" target="_blank">think,</a> and how much we earn. The market shall know our salaries.</p>
<p>We set salary milestones for different stages of the product. You can see them <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XNd62OXI3dduxodI-9dBOUoxnAczPgm2yIk-jFFR6T4/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
<p>Our first milestone will enable us to work full-time in Altocode. That's a salary of €3,000 a month after tax, per founder. That's around US $3,500 after tax. We're a 2-person team, so that's €6,000 after tax a month.</p>
<p>The next question is 'how many paying users do we need to make €6,000 a month after tax?'</p>
<p>We built a simple table that takes into account:</p>
<ul>
<li>Net income per user: how much should the company earn from each paying user after taxes and costs.</li>
<li>Net salary per founder: monthly salary after tax per founder.</li>
<li>Amount of monthly paying users: amount of paying users needed for each net income and net salary.</li>
</ul>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XNd62OXI3dduxodI-9dBOUoxnAczPgm2yIk-jFFR6T4/edit#gid=0"><img loading="lazy" src="https://altocode.nl/blog/img/monthly%20paying%20users%20required.png" alt="ac;pic monthly paying users required"></a></p>
<p>For each column of 'net income per user' we have the amount of paying users necessary to reach €3,000 of net monthly salary per founder.</p>
<p>The next question is, 'what should be the target amount of users for the first milestone?'</p>
<p>It can't be very high, otherwise it might take too long to get there and - as a fully bootstrapped company - we only have so much runway. On the other hand, we can't go for a very low number of paying users, because prices might get too high (we haven't added operating costs and taxes yet) and prevent people from becoming paying users.</p>
<p>In the spirit of <a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/" target="_blank">Kevin Kelly's '1,000 true fans' article,</a> we feel that around 1,500 to 2,000 paying users should allow us to reach our first milestone. If we can't get that amount of paying users in a few months, we have bigger issues than pricing. Still, we needed to continue our analysis to get to a price.</p>
<h4 id="2howmuchdoesitcosttomaintaintheserviceandthecompany">2. How much does it cost to maintain the service and the company?</h4>
<p>This is where most companies make mistakes and later on experience a rude awakening. If we don't understand our costs well, our pricing could be way off (either too cheap or too expensive).</p>
<p>What things do we need to account for besides our net salaries?
a. Income taxes on our salaries.
b. Infrastructure costs.
c. Product-related services: design, security.
d. Business-related services: accountants, lawyers, banking.
e. Working capital.
f. Value Added Tax.
g. Credit card processing and payments.</p>
<p>Let's go through each of these points in more detail.</p>
<p>a. Income taxes on our salaries:
Altocode is based in The Netherlands (this is mainly for 2 reasons: one of the founders lives there, and the EU is a great place to start a company to steward users' data). Income taxes in The Netherlands are anywhere between 30 and 50%, depending on the tax bracket. 40% is a realistic estimation for the first stage of the business.</p>
<p>b. Infrastructure costs:
Our service is fully based on the cloud and our main providers are <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/" target="_blank">Hetzner</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon AWS.</a> There's a very small fixed component to this (hosting, email), but most of this cost is proportional to the amount of space used by our users. This cost will be divided in two parts: that corresponding to free accounts (which will be covered by the company) and that to paid accounts (which is paid by the users themselves as a variable cost; <a onclick="document.getElementById ('whataboutthestorage').scrollIntoView ()">see below</a>).</p>
<p>c. Product-related services: design, security:
Neither of us is a designer or a security expert. Those skills (among others) are crucial to further develop a world-class product. We will be very happy to develop close relationships with design and security experts in the future, hence we need to account for them.</p>
<p>d. Business-related services: accountants, lawyers, banking:
We have a basic company set up, but we will definitely need to invest in accountants &amp; lawyers to set up a larger company structure as soon as we scale to thousands of users. Same goes for upgrading our type of bank account, as well as opening additional accounts for salaries, setting up processes to deal with invoices, etc. While these costs are somewhat fixed, it is reasonable to consider that they will grow based on the size of the business, but we expect that growth to be less than proportional.</p>
<p>e. Working capital:
Any company, and particularly a bootstrapped startup, needs to have working capital (ie: extra money in the bank) in order to grow and withstand crises. Although <a href="https://altocode.nl/blog/our-how" target="_blank">we're not a profit-maximizing company</a> (in short: we cannot sell the company, we cannot get rich from the company and, as we grow in paid accounts, we'll reduce the price per user), we need to be smart and have enough working capital to invest in the company's growth or cover any hiccups that might happen along the way. You either plan this ahead and have a good chance of overcoming most problems or deal with it later in a do-or-die situation. We rather have the former than the latter, for our own sake and our users' sake.</p>
<p>So, how do we take into account the infrastructure cost, product-related services, business-related services and working capital? <strong>We set a cost budget per paying user</strong>. Since all these costs are positively correlated to the size of the business, we can infer that the more users we have - especially in the beginning - the more costs we'll have to account for. Of course, these won't be linear, but in the early stages these costs can add up quickly and halt growth. As we grow we'll have to review this cost item, but now we have to ensure a solid service and business survival.</p>
<p>We concluded that these items combined add €2 per paying user.</p>
<p>An heuristic way to think about this is the following: if we have 100 paying users, it is reasonable to have about €200 of monthly expenses; at 1,000 paying users, it is reasonable to have a budget of €2,000.</p>
<p>f. Value Added Tax:
We have to make a differentiation here.</p>
<ul>
<li>For our European Union paying users, Value Added Tax must be added to the price. A 21% uptick. Nothing to do here.</li>
<li>For our non-European Union users, great news. No Value Added Tax. No changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>g. Credit card processing and payments:
We'll use Stripe. It's easy to use, reliable, and has great international coverage.</p>
<p>From Stripe we'll use 2 services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stripe Payments to collect payments.</li>
<li>Stripe Billing to set recurring payments for our users.</li>
</ul>
<p>For The Netherlands, the pricing is a little different than for the United States (you can check it out <a href="https://stripe.com/en-nl/pricing" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
<p>These are the Stripe fees. Stripe calculates the fees over the final price (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f_Cxl77xqC0xbqdqrOA17CbvBs3GNCjmrROcuVR4Ox0/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">after tax</a>). Now it gets a little tricky.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://altocode.nl/blog/img/stripe%20fees.png" alt="stripe fees for The Netherlands"></p>
<p>On top of the Value Added Tax (VAT) differentiation between European and non-European users, Stripe charges us differently when processing a European card, vs a non-European card. That needs to be taken into consideration in the price.</p>
<p>Lastly, we decided that <strong>we'll only bill in euros</strong>. Our wages are in euros, our costs are in euros, as well as taxes. Having other currencies would complicate things for no good reason.</p>
<h4 id="thepricecalculation">The price calculation</h4>
<p>With all this information we built another table, and built the price from the net income per user, adding all the costs and taxes. We built the price from the bottom up.</p>

<p>You'll note that in the costs line (those €2 per user) we affected half of it with Value Added Tax (VAT). We're estimating that half of our costs will be affected by VAT, so only €1 of the cost per user will incur VAT.</p>
<p>An interesting observation (that took us a while to figure out) is that we should charge an extra amount to non-European users for the VAT incurred by those €2 per user. These services accrue VAT, but because we don't have to pay VAT for non-European users, we cannot use their payment to offset the VAT incurred by those services. Hence, we need to charge them extra to keep things fair between European and non-European users. In addition to this, this fairness ensures that both European and non-European users will be equally profitable to us.</p>
<p>Previously, we had circled between 1,500 and 2,000 paying users to reach our initial goal. That meant a net income per user between €3 and €4. With the numbers more clear, we concluded that our best choice is to go with €3 of net income per user.</p>
<p>The fixed part of ac;pic's price will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>€9 a month for European Union users.</li>
<li>€7.50 for non-European Union users.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We need 2,000 monthly paying users to reach the first milestone.</strong></p>
<h4 id="whataboutthestorage">What about the storage?</h4>
<p>If you followed the cost breakdown you might have noticed that we haven't considered the storage cost for the paid accounts. We accounted for servers to keep the service up &amp; running and the storage cost for free accounts, but the bulk of the cost for a photo and video organization service comes from storage.</p>
<p>The cost we have as of today is €0.05 per GB. <strong>We won't make any profit from storage cost. ac;pic's users will pay storage at cost.</strong> If it's cheaper for us, it will be cheaper for our users.</p>
<p>This cost would incur VAT, but since the underlying server costs also pay VAT at the same rate, the VATs cancel each other out. That, however, assumes that …</p></div>

                        <p>A campaigner says much of the world’s online advertising industry doesn’t comply with Europe’s privacy rules.</p>
                    </header>

							<p>Google and several data brokers are violating the EU's privacy rules by harvesting people's personal information to build highly detailed online profiles, including some firms' collection of information on sexual orientation, health status and religious beliefs, <a href="https://g8fip1kplyr33r3krz5b97d1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/JohnnyRyanDocumnet.pdf">according to a report</a> published on Monday.</p>
<p>The accusations — from Johnny Ryan, a senior fellow at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, an NGO — come 18 months after Ireland's privacy regulator began a probe into how Google collects and shares people's online information for its advertising business.</p>
<p>Several other European data protection authorities subsequently received separate complaints into so-called real-time bidding (RTB), a system by which advertisers use data to target people with paid-for messages when they surf the web.</p>
<p>The online advertising industry, including Google, says it has bolstered privacy protections since the European Union started enforcing its updated rules, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, more than two years ago.</p>
<p>But Ryan, who filed a complaint with the Irish privacy regulator about these data practices in September 2018, said that little has changed since the new rules came online two years ago.</p>
<p>He called on Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC) to act swiftly to clamp down on what he believes were wide-scale breaches of people's online privacy, including the use of online profiles to target individuals around sensitive topics like whether they have AIDS, and to influence voters during elections.</p>
<p>Ryan said the real-time bidding system, which broadcasted web users' online behavior and habits to multiple advertising companies and data brokers, infringed on the region's privacy rules that required data to be kept secure and used proportionately.</p>
<p>"The [Irish Data Protection] Commission has failed to stop that ongoing biggest data breach in history and as a consequence people across Europe and in Ireland are exposed to intimate profiling including of health conditions and political views and location over time, because the RTB system leaks that data into the data broker market," he told POLITICO in reference to Ireland's privacy regulator.</p>
<h3>Spotlight on Dublin</h3>
<p>Because Dublin is home to many of the world's largest tech companies like Google and Facebook, it has the responsibility to oversee how they comply with Europe's privacy standards.</p>
<p>Under the region's data protection rules, sensitive data, including information about a person's health status, sexual orientation or religious beliefs, must be handled more carefully than other information, and companies have to explicitly ask individuals if such information can be collected about them.</p>
<p>"The question for Ireland and the Irish government that must be answered is whether DPC is capable of advancing critical urgent investigations of this nature," he added. "Does it have adequate resources, including technical and procedural competence to discharge its tasks?"</p>
<p>In response, Ireland's privacy agency said that it had met with Ryan to discuss his concerns and that work on its Google investigation continues. The watchdog also has a separate ongoing probe into the data practices of Quantcast, a major online advertising firm, though it has yet to bring an enforcement action or fine against any non-Irish company or organization under Europe's privacy rules.</p>
<p>"The investigation has progressed and a full update on the next steps [was] provided to the concerned party," said Graham Doyle, deputy commissioner at Ireland's privacy agency, in reference to Ryan's complaint about how Google and others collect and use people's data. He declined to comment on what the next steps would be or when a decision would be taken in the investigation into the search giant.</p>
<p>Google said that it also has safeguards in place to protect people's personal data, including in its real-time bidding network.</p>
<p>"We do not allow advertisers to select ads based on sensitive personal data and we do not share people’s sensitive personal data, browsing histories or profiles with advertisers," Alex McPhillips, a Google spokesman, said in a statement.</p>
<p>In his report, Ryan outlines what he says are ongoing privacy failures by many of the world's largest online advertising firms and data brokers linked to the global real-time bidding industry.</p>
<p>That includes OnAudience, a data broker, that holds data on people in almost every country on the planet, according to its website.</p>
<p>It used that information,&nbsp;for instance, to target 1.4 million people who supported gay rights during last year's Polish parliamentary election, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7xo77grl2mnb6b6/AAAlszXoQ_zM2kUSsSRqKJSqa?dl=0&amp;preview=4.+Evidence+of+election+interference+in+Poland+(Appendix+A).pdf" target="_blank">based on&nbsp;a company presentation</a>. To do that, OnAudience created online profiles of people based on whether they had read, watched or searched for content associated with LGBTQ rights ahead of the vote, and used that data for a get-out-the-vote campaign for a local group.</p>
<p>The company also uses its database to allow clients to target people who have displayed an interest in other sensitive data topics such as AIDS and HIV, diabetes, incest and abuse support. Such information is considered sensitive and must be handled with additional care under Europe's privacy rules.</p>
<p>An OnAudience representative said the company does not process any personal data, or information about sexual orientation. “Our data is only based on online behavior and visited content. The campaign mentioned [in Ryan’s research] was not conducted by a political party, but by a social organization that promotes equality.”</p>
<p>"The most intimate thing about anyone that you can buy is their health data because this dictates their life expectancy, their ability to pay their mortgage, the risk of giving them health insurance and potentially influences decisions about whether to employ them," Ryan said.</p>

<p>I always loved getting problems of the type “What is the limit as x approaches infinity” type in high-school/college. You’re given an equation (of the classic y=x format), and asked to derive what the value of y will be as x grows to infinity.</p>



<p>One thing you learn pretty quickly about these types of problems is that often it doesn’t matter where the function “starts” (or where it is at small values of x). It could start at zero, or at negative infinity, but its limit might be infinity, and vice versa (it could start large but have a limit of zero or negative infinity).</p>



<p>In fact, for many equations, there’s usually one <strong>dominant term</strong>. This is the term that dominates the limit. There might be countless other factors or parts of the equation that matter initially, but eventually it’s that dominant term that wins. This is sometimes known as the <strong>dominant term rule</strong>. We’ll get back to this in a second.</p>



<h3>Ads vs. Search</h3>



<p>Google had a little press kerfuffle a few months ago. You can read a summary in the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/31/technology/google-search-results.html">here</a>, but the short of it is that the company launched a design change that made search results and ads look very similar. Presumably, this increased revenue for Google, since many people ignore ads when they can easily identify them, the same way you’d ignore stepping in dog crap if you can identify it in the mud (and yes, given the state of online ads and content I pick this analogy deliberately). But there was a pretty strong backlash against this as a “dark pattern” designed to trick users. After the negative press, Google walked back the change.</p>



<p>If you’ve been following the news around big tech companies these past couple of years, this type of behavior is not surprising at all. These companies have grown really large, are arguably monopolistic, and hyper-focused on growth and revenue. Over and over, they have made decisions that have resulted in backlash from the press and from their users.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if I ignore the past ten years, and jump back to when I worked at Google as an entry-level Software Engineer, it is a <em>little</em> surprising to me. I worked at Google from 2006-2009. At the time, it was already a rapidly-growing public company (I think I joined when there were around 8,000 employees, and left when there were 20,000). I initially worked on the team responsible for AdWords, so I had some exposure to the culture and decisions that were made at the time (of course it wasn’t <em>deep</em> exposure, since I was an entry-level Software Engineer on the lowest rung of the ladder… but it was exposure nonetheless).</p>



<p><em>Note: I’m going to pick on Google a little bit here, but I do love that company. I think there’s a lot it can improve on, but it’s still one of my favorite and least “evil” large tech company. I chose them simply because I’m more familiar with them.</em></p>



<p>At the time, Google employees might have argued against making a change because it was “evil”. The “don’t be evil” motto was still around, and as engineers who were building parts of the product and making decisions, we were pretty ideological about it. One of the company’s values was also to put users first, employees second, and shareholders third. By any of these lenses, the type of design change that Google got flak for recently would have been highly unlikely at the time.</p>



<h3>Revenue is the Dominant Term</h3>



<p>Let’s take a dominant term view of this problem. When a company is first built, several variables dictate its decisions:</p>



<ul><li>The <em>implicit </em>values/culture of the early team. As Ben Horowitz would say, “what you do is who you are.”&nbsp;</li><li>The <em>explicit </em>values/culture of the early team. Are we user-centric? Data-driven? …</li><li>The revenue model.</li></ul>



<p>I think that over time, the revenue model is the dominant term. The limit of a product towards infinity, so to speak, is based on its revenue model. If your revenue model is ads, it doesn’t matter if your stated mission is “to organize the world’s knowledge and make it universally accessible and useful”, “to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together”, or anything else. If your revenue model is ads, you are an ads company.</p>



<p>I’m not diminishing the role of culture and values. I think those are critical. Part of me would love to believe the hundreds of books written on how culture determines everything. But I don’t. At least not for companies that can hire some of the smartest people in the world, gather massive amounts of data, and build technology more sophisticated than ever. And be trying to “maximize shareholder value”.</p>



<p>I’ve actually agonized over whether culture or revenue are the dominant term. In fact, I agonized so much that I’ve had this article in my head for years, and in a Google Doc for months, but I couldn’t get myself to write it / publish it. Because part of me believes culture always wins. Actually, <em>all</em> of me <em>wants </em>to believe culture <em>always</em> wins. But I’ve had my idealism crushed enough times by hard realities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, having and espousing a positive culture and set of values are important. And they may shape how and how quickly the revenue model dominates (for example, companies like Enron or pre-IPO Uber show how bad things can get if you have a terrible culture). But regardless of your mission statement, your culture, your values, and so on, if you choose the wrong revenue model, it will dominate them in a shareholder-value-driven, capitalistic society. Culture can only dominate if it’s negative. A positive culture <em>is </em>necessary, but it’s not sufficient.</p>



<p><em>In other words, over the long term, a company (and its product) will morph to take the shape of its revenue streams.</em></p>



<h3>Charlie Munger Knew It</h3>



<p>Charlie Munger, Warren Buffet’s business partner, has a pretty famous speech where he talks about the power of incentives.</p>



<blockquote><p>“Well I think I’ve been in the top 5% of my age cohort all my life in understanding the power of incentives, and all my life I’ve underestimated it. And never a year passes, but I get some surprise that pushes my limit a little farther.” —<a href="https://fs.blog/2013/02/the-psychology-of-human-misjudgement/">Charlie Munger</a></p></blockquote>



<p>Charlie gives several examples: for instance, FedEx needed to move/sort their packages more quickly, so instead of paying employees per hour, they paid them per shift: productivity increased dramatically (employees now had less incentive to take longer hours to do the same amount of work). Charlie’s model of human behavior is pretty simple: we follow incentives. He makes people sound almost coin-operated.</p>



<p>Now, this isn’t entirely true—there are plenty of examples and research showing that our behavior is more complicated than simple incentives would predict. But Charlie is arguably one of the best investors in the world, and he’s onto something. Even though there might be other variables that influence our behavior, you can still simplify things down to incentives. Incentives are his dominant term.</p>



<p>That incentives are dominant is actually pretty obvious to a lot of people. Somehow in the tech industry, we seem to have just clouded our own judgement through some sense of moral superiority. We care about the impact we’re having on the world. We have noble missions that we rally around and try to hire people who are excited by them. So far, so good. But then we shoot ourselves in the foot by setting up business models with misaligned incentives.</p>



<h3>Look for Aligned Business Models</h3>



<p>So what does this mean in practice? Well, if you only care about making money, it doesn’t mean much. But if you do care about more than money, if you care about the impact your work has and you want to be proud of what you do, it’s worth thinking through this a little more deeply.</p>



<p>Whether you’re starting a company or joining one, look for a business model <em>without</em> perverse incentives. A business model that sets things up so that the better a product is, the better off the company is and its users are.</p>



<p>Sometimes, counterintuitively, a business model may seem aligned at first glance, but end up being quite harmful. The classic example that we’re all now aware of is free products. Free seems great at first glance. But companies have to make money somehow. So they sell ads, or data, or some mix of the two that their users don’t quite understand. And so now, success for the company means more time spent on the product (which may or may not be a good thing for users), less privacy (definitely not a good thing for users), and ultimately more ads.*</p>



<p>So often, paid is better than free*.  At <a href="https://www.monarchmoney.com/">Monarch Money</a>, my current startup, we’ve chosen to go with a paid model, with a hope that we’ll be more aligned in creating value for our users (who we can now call customers… notice how there’s a word for “customer service”, but no “user service”?). There will still be plenty of forks in the road where we can decide whether we help our customers, or take advantage of them, and I hope our values will help us navigate those forks, but at least the revenue model is in our favor.</p>



<p>Another layer to consider is whether your product and revenue model help people with just short-term goals, or a mix of both short and long-term goals. Products that are great and helpful, help their users with both. Good products might help with one or the other. The products with the most potential for damage provide some short-term benefit at the <em>expense</em> of longer-term goals.</p>



<p>So when you consider starting or joining a company, look at the business model, and do the “limit math”. Think about what things might look like if you become massively successful, because you might be.</p>

<p>A large property map hangs in the mayor's office, right next to a display cabinet full of memorabilia accumulated over a long term in office. The coat of arms of the town of Grünheide on the map has faded, as has the writing: "Net settlement area of 300 hectares," it reads, if you look hard enough.</p>


<div>
<p>Arne Christiani's predecessor hung up the poster 20 years ago, back when BMW wanted to build a car manufacturing plant on the site, but then chose the city of Leipzig instead. "When I was first elected mayor in 2003, I left the map up," says Christiani. The pine forest on the edge of the town has remained his field of dreams for almost 17 years.</p><p>During that time, Grünheide has grown steadily, but its population has also aged. It's a place that's beautiful for people who appreciate peace and quiet, but not one that’s particularly tempting for the younger generation. Each year, Christiani has apologized to locals on International Volunteer Day for the fact that it had once again not been possible to attract high-quality industrial jobs to the area.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>For some time now, though, two new maps have been hanging above the old one, with the parcel of land colored red. Christiani's dream could finally be coming true, with Tesla hoping to build electric cars on the site.</p><h3><strong>Dreams Threatened, Dreams Come True</strong></h3><p>If you leave Town Hall and walk a good 800 meters through a pine forest to the edge of the village, you reach a lake called Peetzsee. Christiani had been in office for two years when Johannes Curth and his family came to fulfil their dream here, swapping a rental apartment in Berlin’s Prenzlauer Berg neighborhood for a home of their own, surrounded by forests and lakes.</p>
</div>

<p>The Curths bought a plot of land just a few meters from the shore of the lake back when prices were still reasonable. They built a house with large windows and surrounded by a good-sized yard, in which stand two magnificent old trees in it.</p>

<p>But now that Mayor Christiani's dream is coming true, Curth sees his own dream threatened. "We moved here because of the peace and quiet and the nature," he says. "What will happen if Tesla starts building cars here?" He fears for the quality of the water and air. And he worries about the extra traffic and what will happen to this sleepy community of 8,755 people when Tesla moves in.</p>

<div>
<p>Elon Musk, the entrepreneur behind the carmaker, is an uncompromising man whose ideas jump back and forth between California, Mars and Grünheide. The head of the world's largest electric car manufacturer builds rockets that ferry people into space and dreams of building a hyperloop tunnel for passenger transport. He is adored by his followers because, as an entrepreneur, he refuses to accept any limits.</p><h3><strong>Breathtaking Speed</strong></h3><p>Almost as a byproduct, Musk is now also changing not only the provincial state of Brandenburg, where he’s setting up his factory, but also Germany. The project just outside of Berlin is becoming symbolic for industrial policy in times of climate change. Whereas German companies tend to moan and dig in their heels when the government sets overly ambitious climate targets, as they did last week when the new European Union climate goals were announced, Tesla brings both together: sustainable manufacturing and speed. Breathtaking speed.</p>

<p>Musk's Gigafactory will be built in a region where most structures tend to be single-family homes, if there are any at all. In the first stage of development, 12,000 people will work around the clock in three shifts. Once the factory is complete, more than 40,000 people could produce a good 2 million Tesla vehicles here. "Please work at Tesla Giga Berlin! It's going to be a ton of fun," Musk recently tweeted in German.</p><p>For quite some time, German car executives and politicians tended to make fun of Musk, notorious as he was for his outrageous personality on Twitter. When he outlined his visions at a 2014 lunch with Peter Altmaier - who was chief of staff of Angela Merkel's Chancellery at the time but is now economics minister – and raved about the advantages of electric propulsion, saying it could be used in all means of transportation except for rockets flying into space, Altmaier still thought he sounded a bit unhinged. "At the time," says Altmaier, "nobody thought this technology would be so successful." At least the German competition didn't.</p><p>As recently as 2018, when the California-based company was having troubles with the serial production of its Model 3, Volkswagen considered becoming a strategic investor in Tesla to teach Musk how to do mass production. But reality has long since overtaken that idea: Tesla is now worth five times as much as Volkswagen on the stock exchange.</p><p>The days when the billionaire had to ask politicians for an appointment are over. When he came to Germany in early September to visit his construction site, the reception he received was that of a pop star. Fans shared the latest movement data of his private jet and puzzled where he might pop up next. Leading politicians cleared their calendars at short notice.</p><p>This week, the Musk party is set to continue, and his name will once again appear in newspapers around the world. He has slated this Tuesday as "Battery Day,” when he plans to announce the progress Tesla has made in battery technology in addition to identifying the site of at least one new battery plant. There are many indications, including interviews with Musk, that Grünheide may be chosen as the site. If it is, giant tree-felling machines would again show up to wait for authorization to clear another 60 hectares (nearly 150 acres) of forest.</p><p>It would send an unmistakable message. Because one day later, on Wednesday, hearings are set to begin in the nearby town of Erkner on the 406 complaints against the factory that have been filed by environmental associations and residents. Construction, though, has already been underway for months, with Tesla deciding to move ahead at its own risk with preliminary permits.</p><h3><strong>Faster and Better</strong></h3><p>A recent visit to the construction site in Grünheide provided a glimpse of the degree to which Tesla's mantra has been internalized at Tesla, a mantra by which speed counts most. Evan Horetsky, who heads the roughly 100-member Tesla team in Grünheide, showed a number of interested journalists around the construction site.</p><p>The slim man in his mid-30s with a shaved head and carefully trimmed beard is one of the troubleshooters on Musk's team. He helped out with the Tesla factory in California before going to Reno, Nevada, to lead the creation of the company's first Gigafactory. That had hardly been finished by the time construction in Shanghai began. He says that he and his people have gotten "faster and better" each time. Now, Horetsky is moving things along in Brandenburg.</p><p>Just last fall, the site was covered with tall pine trees. Now, though, they have been replaced by dozens of white concrete pillars protruding from the levelled ground. In the rear section, the shell of the paint shop has been erected. "We gained experience during the construction of the first buildings that we could directly apply in the further development of the design," the American says. "It enabled us to save a couple of days."</p>

<p>The fact that final permission to build the factory has not yet been granted and that skeptical citizens must first be heard doesn't bother Horetsky. He says he takes their fears seriously. He notes that similarly complicated requirements had to be fulfilled when building the factory in Shanghai. "The difference to Germany is that here, the people who are directly affected can have their say," says Horetsky. "And who has more of a right to air their views than they do?"</p><p>It is, essentially, the concrete realization of what had been an abstract discussion. What price is society prepared to pay for the future? And are Germans capable of keeping up with the necessary pace?</p><p>The Gigafactory is set to be built in record time, with the first Y model electric SUVs slated for shipping as early as summer 2021. Plans call for 500,000 electric cars to be produced annually by the end of the first construction stage, a pace the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> has described as "breakneck."</p><p>And all this is taking place in Germany, a country where the length of approval procedures has almost doubled in the last 10 years. And in the state of Brandenburg, where construction of the Berlin-Brandenburg Airport (BER) has been marred by endless construction problems and is finally set to open its doors, fully nine years behind schedule.</p><h3><strong>Not Even Corona Has Slowed the Project</strong></h3><p>It sounded almost like a joke initially: An American high-tech car company with a volatile boss meets German environmental law, citizen participation and German bureaucracy. Now, though, it looks as though electric cars could start rolling off the assembly line in Grünheide even faster than they did in centrally steered China. And not even the coronavirus has thus far managed to slow down the project.</p><p>Somehow, the clichés didn't hold true. Tesla may be a tenacious, demanding company, but it also takes criticism seriously and tries to address it. In contrast to German companies, Musk uses every possibility that planning law avails him to accelerate construction, but he does so at his own risk. At the same time, the Brandenburg government has shown itself to be a skilful negotiator in the fight for the project. Since the contract was awarded, a task force of employees from the participating authorities has met weekly with Tesla representatives to discuss progress on the project.</p><p>Axel Vogel was one of the founding members of the Green Party in 1980.

<p>
As we can see from the table, on every punctuation metric that I could think
of, Deep Diamond and Clojure fare better than Keras &amp; Python.
</p>

<p>
Keras uses almost twice as much parentheses than Deep Diamond. Clojure uses <code>[]</code>
for vector literals, which Deep Diamond uses as tensor shapes. You will note that
there are more than a few of these, and argue that these are parentheses, too.
Fine. Add them up, and Clojure fares slightly better than Python!
</p>

<p>
A parenthesis here and there is not a problem, but there are horror tales of
<code>(((((((</code> and <code>)))))))</code> in Lisps. Not in Clojure. See that there is not a
single <code>((</code> in the Clojure example, and only two occurances of <code>))</code>.
In Python - there are 8.
</p>

<p>
Then we come to all additional assorted punctuation in Python: commas, dots, etc.
In Clojure, there are none, while in Python there are dozens.
</p>

<p>
Python is also riddled with redundant stuff such as <code>model.add()</code>.
</p>

<p>
Etc., etc. You get my point.

<p>Most Sundays, Somia Hamdan visits her local park with her two friends, Amal and Laima. They sit on a picnic bench opposite one another and chat neurotically about Twitter and local gossip. Hamdan is there to socialize but also to supervise. “Since I created the space,” Hamdan said, “I like to take care of it.”</p>



<p>At 23, living in Gaza, Hamdan has been blighted by three brutal conflicts with Israel, decades of protests, a cycle of rocket fire between Israel and Gaza’s rulers, Hamas, and infighting between Palestinian factions. She faces one of the <a href="https://www.unrwa.org/where-we-work/gaza-strip">worst employment rates</a> in the world, <a href="https://www.unrwa.org/activity/education-gaza-strip">oversubscribed schools</a>, and a territory in which movement is tightly controlled and more than half the population <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2020-01-23.7154.h&amp;p=11132">lives on less than $5.50 per day.</a> Live concerts and movie theaters are rare, imports and exports restricted, and <a href="https://www.un.org/unispal/humanitarian-situation-in-the-gaza-strip-fast-facts-ocha-factsheet/">children often used, and killed, for smuggling.</a></p>



<p>Though Hamdan and most of her peers have mobile phones — a lifeline for connecting with the outside world — power cuts are relentless: Az-Zawayda, her home in Deir al-Balah of some 25,000, often has barely <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/08/20/gaza-we-get-four-hours-electricity-day-if-were-lucky">four hours of electricity a day</a>. “There’s little to do here,” Hamdan said.</p>



<p>Before 2018, Hamdan had certainly never played a video game. That year, she learned to play Minecraft, the wildly popular computer game<strong> </strong>in which players make things out of blocks — but not purely for fun. In 2012, U.N.-Habitat, Microsoft, and Mojang, the company that made Minecraft, teamed up on <a href="https://www.blockbyblock.org/about">Block by Block</a>, a venture that aims to improve marginalized areas by actively engaging community members in public projects. According to the U.N., more than 17,000 people have participated in Block by Block initiatives in around 100 different countries — including three<strong> </strong>projects in Gaza — improving hundreds of thousands of lives in the process.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Using Minecraft’s building blocks, community groups design a virtual public space, later made into concrete reality. From parks to beaches and even streets themselves, these spaces are a key indicator of the health and sustainability of cities.<strong> </strong>“If made safe, accessible, and welcoming, they can be drivers of civic cohesion, biodiversity, livelihood, and economic growth,” Christelle Lahoud, 30, a program management officer for U.N.-Habitat, told <em>Rest of World</em>. “If not, we tend to see more crime and pollution, reduced productivity, and general social disparities.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Participants in the Gaza experiment were selected by the Aisha Association for Women and Child Protection, an independent organization and project partner working to achieve gender integration in Gaza. Promising candidates were motivated, interested, and hungry for change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hamdan was one of 42 others — young women, mostly — given the chance to imagine a virtually designed town center through the game.<strong> </strong>The project aimed to design and build a community garden for Az-Zawayda — a modest goal.</p>



<p>Fatma Zoqlam, 18, and her sister, Ghada, 17, also made the cut, much to the approval of their mother. “She was all, like, ‘You have to do it! It will improve your confidence! And communication!’” Fatma, wearing a floral hijab and bright-purple dress, told <em>Rest of World</em> over Skype. “Not that I needed persuading.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Ghada, a tad more shy, wasn’t quite as up for it. “It made me feel nervous, working in a team with strangers,” she said. The first day, the group visited the space, which was only sand, ruins, and unlit roads. “I stood there and thought, This isn’t going to work,” Fatma said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The architects introduced the world of Minecraft. “Most of us had never played a video game before,” Hamdan said, “but it was surprisingly user-friendly.” They were split into groups of four. “We took turns figuring out the keys, playing around,” Ghada said. “Once I got going, I didn’t want to stop.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the second day, things got heated. Keen to impress teammates, the decision-making adults in the room, and their family and friends, things got competitive. “I wanted to have the optimal design. … Because then my work could be reflected in the actual space!” Fatma said. She leaned forward, “I wanted to be able to say to everyone I knew, I made that!”</p>

<p>“I wanted technical approval,” Ghada said. “My group was, er, leader-heavy, though. A boy took charge. He was like, ‘We need to do this, this, and this.’”</p>



<p>What the group concluded was that protective measures were a priority. “We discussed safety a lot,” Hamdan said. “Me and my friends feel scared to leave the house alone. The threat of sexual assault is too much.” (Around 51% of women in Gaza are victims of gender-based violence.) They needed lighting, fencing, security (including a guard), and a separate area for women and families. “The fence was my input,” Ghada said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Fatma, aesthetics mattered — plants, trees, a proud fountain. Her team also made a cafeteria and installed<strong> </strong>municipal Wi-Fi to keep residents connected, along with solar panels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three female Palestinian architects brought the park to fruition. One of them, Tasneem Omar, 29, described the process as “genuinely eye-opening.” Despite Minecraft’s limitations — the game allows players to use only blocks, no curved shapes — the women’s 3D efforts made her job far simpler.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the workshop came to a close, Omar drew up a schematic<strong> </strong>for a park based on the team’s work and handed it over to a group of selected contractors. Save for the Wi-Fi — which was costly and might detract from the community experience of the park — they used almost everything in the team’s design.</p>



<p>On December 31, 2018, Az-Zawayda Community Garden opened. Representatives from civil society organizations in the Gaza Strip, local and international NGOs, local universities, and workshop participants attended the launch. “It was a great feeling,” said Hamdan. “I gave a speech, something I wouldn’t have had the confidence to do before.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since then, additional projects have begun in Kosovo, Nepal, Lebanon, and Guinea; initiatives in Mozambique, South Africa, Ethiopia, Vietnam, Bangladesh, and Kyrgyzstan are currently underway. The Block by Block Foundation is also supporting coronavirus relief projects in ten affected countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For participants, the work is transformative. “We saw our work on the ground,” Fatma said, her eyes wide. “Nothing like this had been done before,” she added. “The municipality had never put us — the public — in charge.”</p>

<p>Many developers think that having a critical bug in their code is the worst thing that can happen. Well, there is something much worse than that: Having a critical bug in your code and <strong>not knowing about it!</strong></p>
<p>To make sure I get notified about critical bugs as soon as possible, I started looking for ways to find anomalies in my data. I quickly found that information about these subjects tend to get very complicated, and involve a lot of ad-hoc tools and dependencies.</p>
<p>I'm not a statistician and not a data scientist, I'm just a developer. Before I introduce dependencies into my system I make sure I really can't do without them. So, <strong>using some high school level statistics and a fair knowledge of SQL, I implemented a simple anomaly detection system <em>that works</em>.</strong></p>

<p>Anomaly in a data series is a significant deviation from some reasonable value. Looking at this series of numbers for example, which number stands out?</p>
<div><pre><span></span>2, 3, 5, 2, 3, 12, 5, 3, 4
</pre></div>


<p>The number that stands out in this series is 12.</p>
<figure><img alt="Scatter plot" src="https://hakibenita.com/images/00-sql-anomaly-detection-scatter-plot.png"><figcaption>Scatter plot</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is intuitive to a human, but computer programs don't have intuition...</p>
<p>To find the anomaly in the series we first need to define what a reasonable value is, and then define how far away from this value we consider a significant deviation. A good place to start looking for a reasonable value is the mean:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>SELECT</span> <span>avg</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span>
<span>FROM</span> <span>unnest</span><span>(</span><span>array</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>12</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>])</span> <span>AS</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span>

<span>       avg</span>
<span>────────────────────</span>
<span>4.3333333333333333</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The mean is ~4.33.</p>
<p>Next, we need to define the deviation. Let's use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation" rel="noopener">Standard Deviation</a>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>SELECT</span> <span>stddev</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span>
<span>FROM</span> <span>unnest</span><span>(</span><span>array</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>12</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>])</span> <span>AS</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span>

<span>      stddev</span>
<span>────────────────────</span>
<span>3.0822070014844882</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Standard deviation is the square root of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance" rel="noopener">variance</a>, which is the average squared distance from the mean. In this case it's 3.08.</p>
<p>Now that we've defined a "reasonable" value and a deviation, we can define a <em>range</em> of acceptable values:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>SELECT</span>
   <span>avg</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>stddev</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>lower_bound</span><span>,</span>
   <span>avg</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>stddev</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>upper_bound</span>
<span>FROM</span>
   <span>unnest</span><span>(</span><span>array</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>12</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>])</span> <span>AS</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span>

<span>    lower_bound    │     upper_bound</span>
<span>───────────────────┼────────────────────</span>
<span>1.2511263318488451 │ 7.4155403348178215</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The range we defined is one standard deviation from the mean. Any value outside this range is considered an anomaly:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>WITH</span> <span>series</span> <span>AS</span> <span>(</span>

<p>Using the query we found that the value 12 is outside the range of acceptable values, and identified it as an anomaly.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-z-score"><a href="#understanding-z-score">Understanding Z-Score</a></h3>
<p>Another way to represent a range of acceptable values is using a z-score. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score" rel="noopener">z-score, or Standard Score</a>, is the number of standard deviations from the mean. In the previous section, our acceptable range was one standard deviation from the mean, or in other words, a z-score in the range ±1:</p>

<p>Using z-score, we also identified 12 as an anomaly in this series.</p>
<h3 id="optimizing-z-score"><a href="#optimizing-z-score">Optimizing Z-Score</a></h3>
<p>So far we used one standard deviation from the mean, or a z-score of ±1 to identify anomalies. Changing the z-score threshold can affect our results. For example, let's see what anomalies we identify when the z-score is greater than 0.5 and when it's greater than 3:</p>

<p>Let's see what we got:</p>
<ul>
<li>When we decreased the z-score threshold to 0.5, we identified the value 2 as an anomaly in addition to the value 12.</li>
<li>When we increased the z-score threshold to 3 we did not identify any anomaly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The quality of our results are directly related to the parameters we set for the query. Later we'll see how using backtesting can help us identify ideal values.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="analyzing-a-server-log"><a href="#analyzing-a-server-log">Analyzing a Server Log</a></h2>
<p>Application servers such as nginx, Apache and IIS write a lot of useful information to access logs. The data in these logs can be extremely useful in identifying anomalies.</p>
<p>We are going to analyze logs of a web application, so the data we are most interested in is the timestamp and the status code of every response from the server. To illustrate the type of insight we can draw from just this data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A sudden increase in 500 status code</strong>: You may have a problem in the server. Did you just push a new version? Is there an external service you're using that started failing in unexpected ways?</li>
<li><strong>A sudden increase in 400 status code</strong>: You may have a problem in the client. Did you change some validation logic and forgot to update the client? Did you make a change and forgot to handle backward compatibility?</li>
<li><strong>A sudden increase in 404 status code</strong>: You may have an SEO problem. Did you move some pages and forgot to set up redirects? Is there some script kiddy running a scan on your site?</li>
<li><strong>A sudden increase in 200 status code</strong>: You either have some significant legit traffic coming in, or you are under a DOS attack. Either way, you probably want to check where it's coming from.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="preparing-the-data"><a href="#preparing-the-data">Preparing the Data</a></h3>
<p>Parsing and processing logs is outside the scope of this article, so let's assume we did that and we have a table that looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>server_log_summary</span> <span>AS</span> <span>(</span>
   <span>period</span> <span>timestamptz</span><span>,</span>
   <span>status_code</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span>
   <span>entries</span> <span>int</span>
<span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The table stores the number of entries for each status code at a given period. For example, our table stores how many responses returned each status code every minute:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>server_log_summary</span> <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>period</span> <span>DESC</span> <span>LIMIT</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>

<span>        period         │ status_code │ entries</span>
<span>───────────────────────┼─────────────┼─────────</span>
<span>2020-08-01 18:00:00+00 │         200 │    4084</span>
<span>2020-08-01 18:00:00+00 │         404 │       0</span>
<span>2020-08-01 18:00:00+00 │         400 │      24</span>
<span>2020-08-01 18:00:00+00 │         500 │       0</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:59:00+00 │         400 │      12</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:59:00+00 │         200 │    3927</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:59:00+00 │         500 │       0</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:59:00+00 │         404 │       0</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:58:00+00 │         400 │       2</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:58:00+00 │         200 │    3850</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Note that the table has a row for every minute, even if the status code was never returned in that minute. Given a table of statuses, it's very tempting to do something like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>-- Wrong!</span>
<span>SELECT</span>
   <span>date_trunc</span><span>(</span><span>'minute'</span><span>,</span> <span>timestamp</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>period</span><span>,</span>
   <span>status_code</span><span>,</span>
   <span>count</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>entries</span>
<span>FROM</span>
   <span>server_log</span>
<span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span>
   <span>period</span><span>,</span>
   <span>status_code</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This is a common mistake and it can leave you with gaps in the data. Zero is a value, and it holds a significant meaning. A better approach is to create an "axis", and join to it:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>-- Correct!</span>
<span>WITH</span> <span>axis</span> <span>AS</span> <span>(</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><section><p>“<em>Are you open tomorrow?</em>”</p><p>“<em>Yes, we open at 9am.</em>”</p><p>The conversation above seems very simple, right? The goal of most voice and chat interactions is to provide a user experience that is as simple as possible. However, this doesn’t mean that these types of interactions are as easy to design or to build. Quite the contrary. There is a lot going on under the hood that the users never see (or, in this case, hear).</p><p>And it only becomes more complex as more modalities are added: With additional interfaces like visual and touch, maybe even gestures or sensory input, the design and development challenge can become multidimensional quickly. This is why it’s important to have a clear, abstracted process when building multimodal experiences.</p><p>In this post, I will walk you through some of the steps involved in building voice and multimodal interactions. We’ll take a look at the RIDR lifecycle, a concept that we introduced with the <a href="https://www.context-first.com/introducing-jovo-v3-the-voice-layer/">launch of Jovo v3</a> earlier this year.</p><p>To kick things off, let’s take a look at a typical voice interaction and then see how this can be expanded to multimodal experiences.</p><h2 id="example-of-a-voice-interaction">Example of a Voice Interaction</h2><figure><a href="#" data-featherlight="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/conversation-intro.png"><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/conversation-intro.png"></a></figure><p>In the introduction of this post, a user asks a question (“<em>Are you open tomorrow?</em>”) and the system (e.g. a bot or an assistant) responds with a (hopefully appropriate) answer like “<em>Yes, we open at 9am.</em>”</p><p>This is what we call an <em>interaction</em>. <a href="https://www.jovo.tech/docs/requests-responses">In our definition</a>, an interaction is a single pair of a user request and a system response. </p><figure><a href="#" data-featherlight="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/request-response.png"><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/request-response.png"></a></figure><p>What might appear like a simple interaction actually requires many steps under the hood to deliver a meaningful response. It looks more like this:</p><figure><a href="#" data-featherlight="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/ridr-lifecycle.png"><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/ridr-lifecycle.png"></a></figure><p>With the <a href="https://context-first.com/introducing-jovo-v3-the-voice-layer-bf369db4808e">launch of Jovo v3</a>, we introduced the RIDR (<em>Request - Interpretation - Dialog &amp; Logic - Response</em>) lifecycle with the goal to establish an abstracted process to get from request to response and make it possible to plug into (interchangeable) building blocks for each step.</p><p>The pipeline includes four key elements:</p><ul><li><u>R</u>equest</li><li><u>I</u>nterpretation</li><li><u>D</u>ialog &amp; Logic</li><li><u>R</u>esponse</li></ul><p>Let’s briefly take a look at each of the steps.</p><h3 id="request">Request</h3><p>The <em>Request</em> step starts the interaction and captures necessary data.</p><figure><a href="#" data-featherlight="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/ridr-request.png"><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/ridr-request.png"></a></figure><p>If we use a voice-first device as an example, there are a few things that need to be handled, like:</p><ul><li>Knowing when to record input (e.g. after a button is pushed or using wake word detection)</li><li>Recording the input</li><li>Figuring out when the person stopped speaking (e.g. with silence detection)</li><li>Processing audio to be passed to the next step</li></ul><figure><a href="#" data-featherlight="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/request-detail.jpg"><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/request-detail.jpg"></a></figure><p>These initial steps usually happen on the device the user is interacting with. Platforms like Amazon Alexa do all these things for you, but if you want to build your own custom voice system (e.g. voice-enabling a web or mobile app, building your own hardware), you may want to handle everything yourself. Jovo Client libraries like “<a href="https://www.jovo.tech/marketplace/jovo-client-web">Jovo for Web</a>” help with some of these elements, like recording mechanisms, visual elements, silence detection, and audio conversions.</p><p>After the input is recorded, the request containing the audio is sent to the <em>Interpretation</em> step of the pipeline.</p><h3 id="interpretation">Interpretation</h3><p>The <em>Interpretation</em> step tries to make sense of the data gathered from the <em>Request</em>.<br></p><figure><a href="#" data-featherlight="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/ridr-interpretation.png"><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/ridr-interpretation.png"></a></figure><p>In our voice example, the previously recorded audio is now	turned into structured meaning by going through multiple steps:</p><ul><li>An automated speech recognition (ASR) service turns the audio into text</li><li>The text is then turned into a structure with <em>intents</em> and <em>entities</em> by a natural language understanding (NLU) service</li><li>Additional steps could include speaker recognition, sentiment analysis, voice biometrics, and more</li></ul><figure><a href="#" data-featherlight="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/interpretation-detail.png"><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/interpretation-detail.png"></a></figure><p>The <em>Interpretation</em> takes an audio file as input, runs it through various services, and then outputs structured, machine-readable data. This is usually a result of a natural language understanding (NLU) service that is trained with multiple phrases:</p><figure><a href="#" data-featherlight="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/nlu-intro.png"><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/nlu-intro.png"></a></figure><p>The service then matches the text provided by the ASR to an intent and optionally a set of entities. In our case it would be the <em>OpenHours</em> intent with additional information (“tomorrow”) in the form of an entity.</p><p>This structured data is then passed to the actual logic of the conversational app in <em>Dialog &amp; Logic</em>.</p><h3 id="dialog-logic">Dialog &amp; Logic</h3><p>In the <em>Dialog &amp; Logic</em> step it is determined how and what should be responded to the user.</p><figure><a href="#" data-featherlight="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/ridr-dialog.png"><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/ridr-dialog.png"></a></figure><p>This step involves a couple of important things such as:</p><ul><li>User Context: Is this a new or existing user? Is any additional data about them available, like preferred location?</li><li>Dialog Management: Where in the conversation are we right now? Is there any additional input we need to collect from the user?</li><li>Business Logic: Is there any specific information about the business that we need to collect?</li></ul><figure><a href="#" data-featherlight="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/dialog-detail.png"><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/dialog-detail.png"></a></figure><p>In the current example, we would collect data about opening hours, maybe specific to the user’s preferred location (if the system manages multiple locations).</p><p>All the necessary data is gathered and then handed off to the <em>Response</em>.</p><h3 id="response">Response</h3><p>In the final <em>Response</em> step, the data from the previous step is assembled into the appropriate output for the specific platform or device.</p><figure><a href="#" data-featherlight="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/ridr-response-1.png"><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/ridr-response-1.png"></a></figure><p>This also usually involves:</p><ul><li>Collecting data from a content management system (CMS) with e.g. localization features</li><li>Sending the output to a text to speech (TTS) service that turns it into a synthesized voice</li></ul><figure><a href="#" data-featherlight="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/response-detail.jpg"><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/response-detail.jpg"></a></figure><p>The output is then played back to the user, either stopping the session (closing the microphone) or waiting for additional input (a new <em>Request</em>). Rinse and repeat.</p><p>This example of a voice-only interaction still seems like a manageable process to design and build. What if we add more modalities though? Let’s take a look.</p><h2 id="multimodal-experiences-beyond-voice">Multimodal Experiences Beyond Voice</h2><figure><a href="#" data-featherlight="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/multimodal-request-response-1.png"><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/multimodal-request-response-1.png"></a></figure><p>The previous example shows how RIDR works with a simple interaction that uses both speech input and output. Early voice applications for platforms like Amazon Alexa focused mainly on voice-only interactions, for example when people talk to a smart speaker without a display. (<em>Note: You could argue that the LED light ring—which indicates that Alexa is listening—already makes it a multimodal interaction.</em>)</p><p>As technology evolves, interactions between users and their devices are becoming increasingly complex. As I highlight in <a href="https://www.context-first.com/introducing-context-first/">Introducing Context-First</a>, products are becoming multimodal by default. This means that we’re seeing more interactions that either offer multiple input modalities (e.g. speech, touch, gestures) or output channels (e.g. speech, visual). <a href="https://www.context-first.com/alexa-please-send-this-to-my-screen/">Alexa, Please Send This To My Screen</a> covers how multimodal interactions can either be continuous, complementary, or consistent experiences.</p><p>Let’s take a look at some multimodal experiences and how they could work with RIDR.</p><h3 id="examples-of-multimodal-interactions">Examples of Multimodal Interactions<br></h3><p>A multimodal experience could be as little as displaying additional (helpful) information on a nearby screen:</p><figure><a href="#" data-featherlight="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/visual-output.png"><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/visual-output.png"></a></figure><p>Or, the visual display could offer touch input for faster interactions, for example in the form of a button (they are sometimes called <em>quick replies</em>):</p><figure><a href="#" data-featherlight="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/quick-replies.png"><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/quick-replies.png"></a></figure><p>It gets increasingly interesting, and challenging to implement, when two input modalities are used in tandem:</p><figure><a href="#" data-featherlight="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/gestures-voice.png"><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/gestures-voice.png"></a></figure><p>The above is similar to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyBEUyEtxQo">Put That There</a> which I mentioned in my previous post <a href="https://www.context-first.com/introducing-context-first/">Introducing Context-First</a>: Someone says something and provides additional context by pointing at an object. Interactions like this are challenging to decode and interpret. The process of making sense of multiple modalities is called <em>multimodal fusion</em>.</p><h3 id="multimodal-interactions-and-ridr">Multimodal Interactions and RIDR<br></h3><p>Let’s take a look at how RIDR can be abstracted even more to work with multimodal interactions. The goal is that each of the building blocks can easily be replaced depending on the current context of the interaction.</p><p>For example, the <em>Request </em>step does not necessarily need to contain just a microphone, it could also have a camera or sensors to collect user input. We could call each of these elements a <em>modality recorder</em>.</p><figure><a href="#" data-featherlight="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/request-multimodal.png"><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/request-multimodal.png"></a></figure><p>In the <em>Interpretation</em> step, it could also be divided into two distinct steps. A <em>recognizer</em> that turns raw input (like audio, video, even emoji or a location) into a format that’s easier to process for an <em>interpreter</em>.</p><figure><a href="#" data-featherlight="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/interpretation-multimodal.png"><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/interpretation-multimodal.png"></a></figure><p>Not every interaction would need to go through each of the steps. Different input modalities might require different treatment:</p><ul><li>Text-based interactions (e.g. chatbots) can skip the speech recognition</li><li>Touch-based interactions need to take into account the payload of e.g. a button (where was it clicked?)</li><li>Vision-based interactions (e.g. gestures) need different steps that involve computer vision and interpretation</li></ul><p>As mentioned earlier, this can get even more complex as you add multiple modalities at once. For this, an additional step for <em>multimodal fusion</em> is introduced.</p><figure><a href="#" data-featherlight="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/multimodal-fusion.png"><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/multimodal-fusion.png"></a></figure><p>The <em>Dialog &amp; Logic</em> step from the voice example above can stay the same for now. We’ll take a deeper look at this in the next post as there are many additional layers to dive into.</p><p>The <em>Response</em> step is another interesting one. Where voice requires a text-to-speech (TTS) service, a multimodal experience might need additional elements like visual output or a video avatar. We call services fulfilling this step <em>output renderers</em>.</p><figure><a href="#" data-featherlight="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/response-multimodal.png"><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/response-multimodal.png"></a></figure><p>That’s how we currently envision multimodal user interfaces to work under the hood. This model will be updated and improved as we iteratively learn and experiment with the addition of new modalities. </p><h2 id="open-questions-and-outlook">Open Questions and Outlook<br></h2><p>This post provided a first introduction to the many steps involved when building a seemingly simple voice interaction, and how this can be applied to multimodal experiences.</p><p>Again, this is a work in progress. Here are some additional questions I currently have:</p><ul><li>Right now, this only covers user-initiated (pull) request-response interactions. What if the system starts (push)?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The shipbreaking industry has been around as long as there have been ships but over the past half-century it has gravitated to regions offering both inexpensive land and cheap labor. Prior to World War II, yards in Europe, the US and Japan handled most shipbreaking, with the well known Ward yard in the United Kingdom gaining public attention by breaking up some of Britain's best known ocean liners and naval vessels.</p><p>After the end of the war, and with many worn-out ships to dispose of, Taiwan became a major destination for vessels approaching the end of their economic lifespans. This saw the Port of Kaohsiung, in southern Taiwan, become a major base for the industry where vessels could be brought alongside makeshift berths and cut down using semi-skilled labor and oxy/acetylene torches. However, once the land supporting these waterfront businesses became too valuable for demolition in the 1980s the mudflats of Pakistan, India and Bangladesh rose to prominence by offering even cheaper labor as well as lax environmental regulations and low taxes.</p><p>In Europe, what remained of the shipbreaking industry gravitated from the north to less expensive locations in Spain and Turkey, with the latter nation still continuing to compete with Asian breakers for smaller ships. In the United States most shipbreaking has been consolidated along the 17-mile shipping channel leading to the Port of Brownsville,Texas, near Mexico, where much of the resulting scrap is processed, while a small yard at Port Colborne, Ontario handles some Canadian and Great Lakes ships.</p><p><strong>Kaohsiung – Once the Shipbreaking Leader</strong></p><p>The process of breaking up a ship is both dangerous and labor-intensive. In 1979 this writer was sent to Kaohsiung, Taiwan to report on the demolition of P&amp;O Line's <strong><i>Arcadia</i></strong>, which had helped pioneer the Alaska cruise industry in the early 1970s.</p><p>At the time Kaohsiung was the largest ship breaking center in the world, with Hong Kong's Junk Bay a close second and South Korea closing rapidly. <strong><i>Arcadia</i></strong>, built by Great Britain's famous John Brown yard at Clydebank in 1953, had been purchased by a Japanese broker in 1978 and resold to a Kaohsiung-based company for demolition. By that time the steam turbine propelled ship, built for the Australian immigrant trade, had steamed more than 2.5 million miles and was ready for retirement.</p><p>Through the auspices of the Regional Association of Old Ship Demolition Engineering Industry, a ponderously titled organization that served as an umbrella agency for the shipbreakers of Kaohsiung, I was introduced to Mr. Wang Fu Yin of Keun Hwa Steel who would be my guide though the yards. As an English-speaking staff member of one of the region's larger steel works he was in a good position to answer most of my questions concerning the industry.</p><p><strong>Dah Jen and Dah Lin Pu</strong></p><p>In the 1970s ship demolition was done at two major facilities located within the southern reaches of Kaohsiung <a href="https://www.pacmar.com/search/Harbor">Harbor</a>, Dah Jen and Dah Lin Pu, where vessels were brought alongside rather than "beached" as is done today in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. This offered a much quicker demolition cycle than beaching as cut sections of ships could be loaded directly onto trucks for transport to regional mills rather than slowly pulled across mudflats for additional cutting.</p><p>Our first destination was the enormous Dah Jen complex located only a few miles from the city's airport. On our way through Kaohsiung our car was constantly passed by overburdened trucks transporting huge chunks of metal to the surrounding mills. Once in the yard itself we found ourselves surrounded by what appeared to be an endless wall of obsolete vessels; smoke, dust and powdered rust permeating the air. Around us winches were pulling cables taunt as heavy sections of metal were torn loose from hulls while fans of sparks cascaded down from hulls where workers were cutting ships apart from the inside out.</p><p><strong>Shipbreaking 101</strong></p><p>In answer to several of my questions, Mr. Wang explained how Kaohsiung's breaking industry worked. Ships were acquired on the world market through either independent brokers or the China Dismantled Vessel Trading Corporation, a purchasing cooperative formed by the breakers themselves. As is the practice today, the price was largely determined by a vessel's Light Displacement Tonnage (LDT). This is the weight of a complete but unloaded, un-fueled and un-provisioned ship. As an example, the world's largest ship of that era, the stretched petroleum tanker <strong><i>Seawise Giant</i></strong>, had a loaded displacement of 647,955 tons but a light displacement of only 83,192 tons.</p><p>Mr. Wang noted that the actual price paid per vessel varied according to market conditions, the type of ship, its construction, the quality of its steel and what additional material or equipment it might still be found aboard. This included fuel oil as well as spare propellers and shafts.</p><p>Higher prices would normally be paid for vessels having large amounts of flat steel plate, such as tankers and bulk carriers, while lower prices might be offered for passenger liners and refrigerator ships, both having complicated interiors and large amounts of wood and insulation to deal with.</p><p>During our tour of Dah Jen it could be seen that there was very little sympathy shown to ships in the actual breaking process. Great liners were torn apart, plundered, and melted down just as rapidly as the rustiest of old general cargo ships. Mr. Wang noted that each breaker maintained his own berthing area, which was sub-leased from the Kaohsiung <a href="https://www.pacmar.com/search/Harbor">Harbor</a> Authority.</p><p>The docks were staggered in such a manner that they allowed about a third of a ship alongside, the other two-thirds jutting out into the water. This permitted the greatest number of ships to be broken up in the most compact area.</p><p>Demolition would usually commence several days, and sometimes several weeks, after a vessel had arrived off port. Paper work would have to be cleared, import duties tabulated, business licenses obtained and various <a href="https://www.pacmar.com/search/Harbor">Harbor</a> fees paid. When everything was in order a vessel would be allowed to come alongside and its crew released for the long flight home.</p><p><strong>Subcontractors</strong></p><p>Once a ship was berthed the first of a number of subcontractors would scramble on board. Kaohsiung breakers at the time used various local contractors to "clean the ship," with each group having its own specialty. The first group would normally remove loose items – furnishings, tables, chairs, mattresses, lamps, cutlery, even the galley sink – all of it going over the side and into waiting trucks for delivery to second-hand shops. Next on board would be the wood removers. This group would attack the cabins, holds and decks, stripping timbers, planks, shelving and veneers, anything considered flammable, the wood itself being bundled up for sale ashore.</p><p>Once flammables were removed the cutters would come aboard. They were considered the craftsmen of the industry and their speed largely determined the profit to be made on each vessel.</p><p>At Kaohsiung the stern of a ship would usually be dismantled first, with large sections of the hull cut and lowered onto waiting trucks. The shoreside machinery used in this process – old derricks, winches and rigging – had been removed from ships long ago melted down.</p><p>Cutting would continue down to the engine room where pumps, generators and compressors would be removed for resale while the main engine would be demolished. The propeller shaft would then be removed and the bronze propeller lifted clear, its blades to be cut off by drilling. Work would then continue forward, the ship rising slowly upwards with each ton of metal removed.</p><p>Rigging and masts would come down and deck winches cut loose, all to be lowered overboard. In six weeks the average freighter or tanker could be reduced to its double-bottom, which would be towed to a separate beach and pulled ashore for final rendering.</p><p><strong><i>Arcadia</i></strong></p><p>To visit <strong><i>Arcadia</i></strong> we drove around the lower end of Kaohsiung <a href="https://www.pacmar.com/search/Harbor">Harbor</a> to the Dah Lin Pu facility where the white-hulled ship had been positioned alongside the large tanker <strong><i>Andros Apollon</i></strong>. The scene was bleak as the 100,000-dwt crude carrier, less than a decade old, was already being cut apart while <strong><i>Arcadia</i></strong> had been intentionally listed over so her remaining fuel could be pumped off, the oil going into her once pristine lifeboats for transport ashore.</p><p>At the top of the pilot ladder a guard listened patiently to Mr. Wang's excuse for our coming aboard, then waved us on into the ship's dark interior. There was neither electricity nor lights. The only sound came from a motorized pump that was working on the liner's fuel supply far below. With flashlights in hand we proceeded forward along a dark corridor until we came to the main staircase. Here, workers were moving mattresses in bundles up to the outside decks.</p><p>As we passed one cabin, its door ajar, I looked in to see the bedding gone but two glasses still standing in their holders at the sink while two white shaving towels still hung on their hooks below. Orange life vests were still visible overflowing from the closets. Nothing had been disturbed.</p><p>Moving upward, we entered a lounge where we encountered more workers cutting and rolling up sections of carpet, the furniture having already gone over the side into waiting trucks. On the outside promenade we found yet another crew busily chiseling up the wooden decks, the tropical hardwood going into large bundles.</p><p><strong>Nautical Antiques</strong></p><p>In a small room forward we came across Mr. Ming H. Wu of Rainbow Enterprises who was busy sorting through light fixtures taken from<strong> <i>Arcadia's</i></strong> various public rooms. Mr. Ming was a local antiques dealer and had purchased most of <strong><i>Arcadia's</i></strong> decorative furnishing and brass items. Beyond him were stacked many of the ship's red and white life preservers as well as brass staircase railings, bed lamps and wooden deck chairs. He explained that all of the items would be shipped overseas, largely to antique dealers in United States, Europe and Japan.</p><p>Continuing to move forward and upward we …</p></div></div>

<br>
Still from the Netflix documentary, The Social Dilemma
</center>
<p>Netflix recently aired a new documentary, <a href="https://www.humanetech.com/the-social-dilemma">"The Social Dilemma"</a>, which explores in detail the harmful effects that social networks such as Facebook and Instagram have on individuals and society at large. One of the interviewees in the documentary, Jeff Seibert, has written a more <a href="https://medium.com/@jeff_seibert/the-mechanics-and-psychology-behind-the-social-dilemma-719d618aa8ce">detailed piece</a> on the underlying causes, methods and impacts of current social networks on society and democracy. He argues that advertising-driven business models combined with user-generated content and machine learning lead to increased polarization and anxiety, widespread misinformation, and mass-scale manipulation of society. Some proposals to fight this include regulation, like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which place strong controls on collecting data on users, even potentially banning personalized advertising.</p>
<p>We agree with Seibert, and we also have a solution. Regulation has the danger of increasing the power of the dominant incumbents, if it's not done correctly. They treat it as a burden and moat preventing competition, and competition is what is needed most. What new competitors need is a different business model. A business based on selling ads is not aligned with the interests of its user base. <strong>What if, instead of advertisers being the customer, the actual end-users were the customer?</strong> If users paid a small amount on a subscription basis, then the business would be incentivized to keep customers happy. This model may not maximize revenue for the company, but so long as the company is sustainable and able to grow, then that shouldn't matter. The apparent obsession with maximising revenue and growth at all costs is not healthy, and models in which users pay directly for services are better in the long term - for individuals and for society.</p>
<p>Whatsapp was a great example of a succesful subscription-based business. They started off charging a subscription of $1 per year. At the time of their acquisition, in 2014, Whatsapp had 450 million monthly active users, and annualized revenue of around $32M [<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/28/whatsapp-revenue">source</a>], and were adding a million new users every day [<a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2014/Facebook-to-Acquire-WhatsApp/default.aspx">source</a>]. For a company that had only 55 employees and operating cost around $10M, that sounds sustainable. Whatsapp also weren't really pushing for monetization, but rather growth. For example, they were relaxed about enforcing the $1 fee after the first year, and didn't apply it at all in certain countries. For comparison, at the time Facebook was making $7 in revenue per user.</p>
<p>Even a good business model can change depending on who owns the company. If investors or shareholders demand that profit is maximized, then that's what you have to do. To prevent this you either need to have benevolent investors, who aren't focused on maximising revenue at all costs, or don't have any investors. This could mean being entirely self-owned, or being a non-profit organisation. This alone probably isn't enough though - what's needed are built-in defences keeping any potential future owners honest and aligned with the users.</p>
<p>One of these defences to keep the company's interests aligned with the users is to reduce the barrier to leaving. If the social network is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization">decentralized</a> then this is structurally enforced. In that case, if the company starts to misbehave in some way, users can easily move to another company (or self host) and keep all their data and friends. This is not possible with centralized social networks without open protocols. An open protocol actually takes this even further, as the user interface itself can be replaced. If the company were to start adding malicious features to the interface, people can simply switch to a different one. Combining this with being open source means it is also easy to modify the existing user interface. Social media incentives have never been this aligned with the users before. </p>
<p>There is still one major ace card to be played to protect users: end-to-end encryption. If the service cannot read your data, then it is impossible to target ads, even if they wanted to. This means that any social feed cannot be an arbitrary black box machine learning algorithm - it has to be assembled client side, thus putting end users in full control of their data and returning their autonomy. </p>
<p>The final component is ethical humane design. That means designing for the good of the human user. No manipulative notifications or dark UI patterns designed to increase engagement and steal more of the user's life. Social media should be a tool that is used to enhance people's lives, not something that manipulates people into spending more time on it. </p>
<p><em>"If something is a tool, it genuinely is just sitting there waiting, patiently. If something is not a tool, it's demanding things from you. It's seducing you. It's manipulating you. It wants things from you. And we've moved away from having a tools based technology environment, to an addiction and manipulation based technology environment. That's what's changed. Social media isn't a tool that's just waiting to be used. It has its own goals, and its own means of pursuing them by using your psychology against you."</em> <br>
</p><p>-Tristan Harris in The Social Dilemma</p>
<p>Putting all of the above together, what is needed is an open, decentralized, end-to-end encrypted and ethical social network whose business model is subscription based.</p>
<p>That's exactly what we're building.</p>

		<div>
			
<p>If you have recently been promoted to tech lead, or doing it for a while, you’ll deeply appreciate that there is hardly any time for coding, or maybe zero time at all.</p>



<p>There are a lot of people related things to do, project planning things to do, improving for the future or responding to emergencies. It can quickly turn into a blue screen of meeting appointments and none of them say “work on your favourite coding project”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course you could code in your spare time, but let’s face it often we are too tired after working all day, and there are friends, hobbies and commitments outside of work.</p>



<p>You want to code more because, it is your passion! And also so you can understand what your team is talking about. And also if things go south, to pass a coding test for your next job! For me the main reason is because coding and building stuff is damn awesome!</p>



<h2>So how to get deep into some coding again?</h2>



<p>I have come up with the top 3 ways I know from experience will help you to keep up with coding. Not all of these will be instant – it might take a few weeks to work them in, but they will pay off and free up your time for coding, which is definitely a part of your job as a tech lead in most companies.</p>



<h3>1. Delegation</h3>



<p>Delegation is more than just dumping your work on other people and slapping your hands together with a grin. In-fact if you are not used to it, it can feel mentally harder than just doing the thing yourself. However you will be forced to delegate at some point due to your limit hours per week and so many Slacks and emails coming in. I suggest you actively choose what to delegate and be ruthless.</p>



<p>Delegation can be a whole blog post of book of it’s own. So I will reduce this down to one simple tip – each day try to delegate something that you previously would be loathed to delegate. What is that for you?</p>



<p>For me it is running the daily standups, I felt like that was a “Team Leaders Job” and that developers would be against doing this. However once I started doing it, well it worked out perfectly fine and I think we got a lot of benefits in terms of engagement in the meetings. If you know it’s your turn to run the meeting soon you probably won’t zone out.</p>



<p>The key point about delegation is to be clear what you are asking, and to follow up. It’s still your responsibility, it is just someone else is doing the heavy lifting for you now.</p>



<p>Once you get better or more used to delegation you’ll get more time for yourself to do what you want, including coding work.</p>



<h2>2. Keep it boring</h2>



<p>As a tech lead you are now the voice of reason, and you are thinking of the business. Convert everything to NoSQL, Kubernetes and NextJS? As a developer you might love a company that chooses a lot of new or different tech, it’s fun to learn and apply. However as a lead you need to think about what will actually pan out well, where the future issues and risks might lay.</p>



<p>By keeping the tech boring – by which I mean make well thought out and informed technology choices – you will do your team a big favour by helping make it easy to deliver things on time. It also increases your chance of being able to contribute.</p>



<p>Here you can carve out little 1 hour tasks that you can do yourself to keep you in the loop. An example is upgrading package dependencies and fixing any issues that introduces. As a result you would be forced to, for example look at the release notes for the next version of React or Typescript say and learn what is new. Hint – if you do this a lot it won’t be anything too exciting, some bug fixes and the odd feature.</p>



<p>By keeping it boring you increase the chance of you being able to contribute to the code, and keep coding.</p>



<h2>3. Choose some people to follow</h2>



<p>Go follow blogs from great developers such as <a href="https://overreacted.io/">Dan Abarmov</a>, or read an article from the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler</a> back catalog (he writes <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeAsDocumentation.html">timeless stuff</a>) can keep you up to date and learning new things. It is a very efficient method to find trusted distilled information. Be choosy about who you follow! And over time keep changing it up.</p>



<p>Come up with an easy to follow schedule, e.g. read one blog post per week, whatever is easy to achieve and start from there. Even better, read a post, then discuss it with your team as part of an appropriate meeting (e.g. you might have architectural meetings or such like), and see what everyone’s viewpoint is on the ideas in the post. You might even get an action out of it that will help you on your current workload.</p>



<p>By following blogs like these, you are not coding per-se, but you are learning which will help you keep up to date, and sometimes it will mean you discover a tool or way of doing things your team can take advantage of.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now I have just given you a lot more stuff to do, which in itself might feel like a pain. It is an investment though. Try to anchor these onto something you already do. If you do one-on-one meetings for example you could add a “work to delegate” item to that agenda. Now you don’t have to think about this anymore, until you are in the meeting.</p>







<p>They are my 3 main tips for finding more time, hope you found it useful.</p>



<p>Now it is time to think about what you are going to do next. Here is what I recommend:</p>



<p>Of the 3 tips, if you are only going to do one, then work on delegation, and do the following right now:</p>



<p><em>(If you are not at work now, send an email to your work address to remind yourself when you are back in.)</em></p>



<ul><li><strong>Actions</strong>:<ul><li>Write down a quick summary of the stuff you need to do today at work.</li><li>Pick a task that you would normally be nervous for any reason to delegate to someone else.</li><li>Acknowledge the reason why you are nervous</li><li>Make sure you can describe the task in such a way you can hand it to someone in the team.</li><li>Pick the best person to do this, and tell them to do it.</li><li>Put a date in your calendar to follow up on the task</li><li>Put a date in your calendar to repeat this exercise</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>Well done you have now <em>really</em> delegated something, and once it is done, you will be able to delegate this task again and again.</p>



<p>Soon enough, you will find the problem is what tech work to work on in your newly freed up time. A good problem to have.</p>

<p>QtQuick, in one word, is <em>amazing</em>. </p>
<p>QtQuick, in slightly more words, is a scene graph implementation. At a developer level we create abstract "Items" which might be some text or a rectangle etc or a picture. This in turn gets transformed into a tree of nodes with geometry, "materials" and transforms. In turn this gets translated into a big long stream of OpenGL instructions which we send to the graphic card.</p>
<p>Qt6 will see this officially change to sit on top of the "Render Hardware Interface" stack, that instead of always producing OpenGL, will support Vulkan, Metal and Direct3D natively. The super clever part about it is that custom shaders (low level fast drawing) are also abstracted; meaning we will write some GLSL and generate the relevant shader for each API without having to duplicate the work.</p>
<p>This blog series gives a lot more detail: <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-quick-on-vulkan-metal-direct3d">https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-quick-on-vulkan-metal-direct3d</a>.</p>
<p>Plasma code primarily interacts with Items and occasionally nodes, slightly above the level being abstracted. </p>

<p>Qt 5.15 ships with a tech preview of RHI and the Vulkan interface. I spent some time to set it up and explore what we need to do to get our side fully working. With some packages installed, a few plasma code fixes and some env vars set, I have a fully working Vulkan plasmashell.</p>
<h2>Screenshot</h2>
<p><a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plasma_vulkan.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plasma_vulkan-939x1024.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly it looks the same, so a screenshot is very unexciting. I enabled the Mesa overlay as some sort of proof.<br>
The reason it shows 2fps is because plasmashell only updates when something has changed; in this case the textcursor blinking every 500ms.</p>
<p>Despite it being a preview it is in a damn good state! Things are usable, and really quite snappy, especially notification popups.</p>
<h2>What needs work</h2>
<p>Some things need work on our side, in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>All of our custom shaders need porting to the updated shader language.</li>
<li>Taskbar thumbnails use low level GL code that needs one extra layer of implementation.</li>
<li>Use of QtQuickWidget in systemsettings. </li>
</ul>
<p>It means some elements are invisible or don't render with the full graphical effects, or in the last case, crash. </p>
<p>But in the whole scheme of things, everything is in a very encouraging state</p>
<h3>What about KWin?</h3>
<p>Whilst QtQuick is the cornerstone of plasmashell, systemsettings and so many applications, for historical reasons KWin made use of OpenGL before it was a mainstream part of Qt. Therefore this setup is mostly unrelated to KWin. Fortunately there's no reason these two have to be in sync.</p>

<p>This isn't usable for end users, and given it's only a tech preview upstream, this is not something we can ever expect to officially support within Plasma 5.</p>
<p>But we can start doing the prep work, also the current state is so promising I think we can deliver a native Vulkan experience to users on the first day of Plasma 6.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote>
<p><em>This post <a href="https://github.com/LightTag/sequence-labeling-with-transformers">comes with a repo</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our previous post on
<a href="https://www.lighttag.io/blog/sequence-labeling-with-transformers/">aligning span annotations to Hugginface's tokenizer outputs</a>
discussed the various tradeoffs one needs to consider, and concluded that a windowing strategy over the tokenized text
and labels is optimal for our use cases. </p>
<p>This post demonstrates an end to end implementation of token alignment and windowing. We'll start by implementing
utility classes that make programming a little easier, then implement the alignment functionality which aligns offset
annotations to the out of a tokenizer. Finnaly we'll implement a PyTorch Dataset that stores our aligned tokens and
labels as windows, a Collator to implement batching and a simple DataLoader to be used in training. </p>
<p>We'll show and end to end flow on the DDI Corpus, recognizing pharmacological entities with BERT.</p>
<h2>Utility Classes For Convenient APIs</h2>
<p>We'll start by defining some types and utility classes that will make our work more convenient</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> typing_extensions <span>import</span> TypedDict
<span>from</span> typing <span>import</span> List<span>,</span>Any
IntList <span>=</span> List<span>[</span><span>int</span><span>]</span> 
IntListList <span>=</span> List<span>[</span>IntList<span>]</span> </code></pre></div>

<h2>The Alignment Algorithm</h2>
<h3>FastTokenizers Simplify Alignment</h3>
<p>Recent versions of Hugginface's tokenizers library include variants of Tokenizers that end with Fast and inherit
from <a href="https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/tokenizer.html#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerFast">PreTrainedTokenizerFast</a><br>
such as <a href="https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/bert.html#berttokenizerfast">BertTokenizerFast</a>
and <a href="https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/gpt2.html#gpt2tokenizerfast">GPT2TokenizerFast</a>. </p>
<p>Per the tokenizer's documentation</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the tokenizer is a “Fast” tokenizer (i.e., backed by HuggingFace tokenizers library), [the output] provides in addition several advanced alignment methods which can be used to map between the original string (character and words) and the token space (e.g., getting the index of the token comprising a given character or the span of characters corresponding to a given token).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notably, the output provides the methods
<a href="https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/tokenizer.html#transformers.BatchEncoding.token_to_chars">token<em>to</em>chars</a>
and <a href="https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/tokenizer.html#transformers.BatchEncoding.char_to_token">char<em>to</em>token</a>
which do exactly what their name implies, provide mappings between tokens and character offsets in the original text.
That's exactly what we need to align annotations in offset format with tokens.</p>
<h2>A warmup implementation</h2>
<p>Our final implementation will use the BIOUL scheme we mentioned before. But before we do that, let's try a simple
alignment to see what it feels like</p>

<h3>Accounting For Multi Token Annotations</h3>
<p>In the above example, some of our annotations spanned multiple tokens.
For instance "Tal Perry" spanned "Ta", "##l" and "Perry". Clearly by themselves none of those tokens are a Person, and
so our current alignment scheme isn't as useful as it could be.
To overcome that, we'll use the previously mentioned BIOLU scheme, which will indicate if a token is the beginning,
inside, last token in an annotation or if it is not part of an annotation or if it is perfectly aligned with an annotation.</p>

<p>Notice how <strong>founder</strong> above has a <strong>U</strong> prefix and the other annotations now follow a BIL scheme.</p>
<h3>Mapping Labels To Ids</h3>
<p>It's great that we have our annotations aligned, but we need the labels as integer ids for training.
During inference, we'll also need a way to map predicted ids back to labels.
I'm going to make a custom class that handles that, called a LabelSet. </p>

<p>Now that we have alignment logic in place, we need to figure out how to load, batch and pad the data. We also need
to handle the case where our text is longer than we can feed our model. Below we show an implementation of a
particular strategy, windowing over uniform length segments of the text. This isn't the only strategy, or even
necessarily the best, but it fits our use case well. You can read more about
why <a href="https://www.lighttag.io/blog/sequence-labeling-with-transformers/">we use windowing when training ner models with BERT here</a>.
Below we'll just show how to do that.</p>
<h2>The Raw Dataset</h2>
<p>We'll be using the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046413001123">DDI Corpus</a>. You can download
a JSON verion of it  <a href="https://github.com/LightTag/DDICorpus">here</a>.

<h2>Padding and Windowing in a Dataset</h2>
<p>Our dataset is conveniently split into sentences. We still need to batch it and pad the examples.
More commonly, data is not split into sentences, and so we will window over fixed sized parts of it.
The windowing, padding and alignment logic will be done in a pytorch Dataset and we'll get to batching in a moment.</p>

September 21, 2020 | http://amiller.github.io/lambda-auth/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://amiller.github.io/lambda-auth/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post">

<p>λ● (pronounced “lambda-auth”) is a tool for generating secure “Authenticated Data Structure” protocols from simple specifications written in an ordinary programming language (OCaml).</p>

<p>The tool consists of a patched OCaml compiler, and is based on a programming language design presented at POPL 2014.</p>

<h2 id="whats-an-authenticated-data-structure">What’s an Authenticated Data Structure?</h2>

<p>Authenticated Data Structures (ADSs) are protocols for outsourcing data to untrusted parties. For example, suppose a Client doesn’t have much storage capacity (maybe it’s a mobile device) but can communicate with a powerful Server it doesn’t trust. With an ADS, the Client only has to store a tiny amount of data, yet is guaranteed that its queries are answered correctly.</p>

<p><img src="http://amiller.github.io/lambda-auth/assets/graphic.png">
</p>

<p>ADSs work by augmenting ordinary data structures with collision-resistant cryptographic hashes. </p>

<h2 id="example-binary-search-tree">Example: Binary Search Tree</h2>

<p>Creating an ADS protocol in λ● is as easy as writing an ordinary data structure program in OCaml. The following code (from <code>examples/bintree.ml</code>) is an example of membership lookup in an authenticated set of integers:</p>

<!--?prettify lang=ml?-->
<pre><code>let rec (member : 'auth tree -&gt; int -&gt; bool) x = function
  | Tip -&gt; false
  | Bin a -&gt; let (l,y,r) = (fun x -&gt; unauth x) a in
      if x = y then true else if x &lt; y
      then member x l
      else member x r &lt;br&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The only non-standard syntax is the <code>'auth</code> type operator and <code>unauth</code> keywords, which are used to provide hints on where to compress the data structure by applying hashes. The λ● compiler automatically generates executables for both the Client and the Server from this single piece of input code.</p>

<h2 id="running-the-examples">Running the examples</h2>

<p>Get the most recent version of λ● from github:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/amiller/lambda-auth
</code></pre>

<p>To run the examples, you will first need a copy of ocaml (trunk) installed, and the source directory should be located in the previous directory as <code>../ocaml-trunk</code>.</p>

<p>Next, run the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>$ make                   # Builds the compiler
$ make prover            # Builds the prover examples
$ make verifier          # Builds the verifier examples
</code></pre>

<p><span size="-1"><em><b>WARNING Although the topic here is secure software, this is a research prototype, it has not been audited, and you should not use it in production for anything serious.</b></em></span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">
    <article>

        

        <section>
            <div><p>TLS certificates are offered for free by LetsEncrypt and cert-manager, a popular tool from Jetstack makes the management and renewal automatic. The tooling changes often and even experienced Kubernetes users find the process confusing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last Updated: September 2020 - to include ingress-nginx rename, and inlets-operator to run these instructions at home or on-premises.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jetstack/cert-manager/ed2c0e0b3df1d10c3ad219348ed7b1ba56771655/logo/logo.svg?sanitize=true" width="200px"></p>
<p>For that reason there is <a href="https://docs.openfaas.com/reference/ssl/kubernetes-with-cert-manager/">documentation on the OpenFaaS website</a> for how to configure a TLS certificate for your OpenFaaS Gateway. Once in place, traffic between your users and your Kubernetes cluster is encrypted.</p>
<p><img src="https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/27013154?s=200&amp;v=4" width="200px"></p>
<p>Today I'll show you how to bootstrap everything from scratch on a managed Kubernetes service using the OSS <code>arkade</code> tool.</p>
<h3 id="provisionyourkubernetescluster">Provision your Kubernetes cluster</h3>
<p>You can provision a cluster wherever you want, whether that be Google Kubernetes Engine, DigitalOcean Kubernetes, AWS EKS or somewhere else.</p>
<p>I suggest you create a cluster with DigitalOcean since it's fast, cheap, and a fully managed cluster. Once you have everything working, move on to your preferred choice for your company or team.</p>
<p>Product page for: <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/">DOKS</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Setup a cluster in your preferred region with around 2-4GB RAM total and at least 2x vCPUs.</li>
<li>Download your KUBECONFIG file and run <code>export KUBECONFIG=~/Downloads/kube.config</code> (replace the path with the actual name)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="getarkade">Get arkade</h3>
<p><code>arkade</code> can be used to install <code>apps</code> to Kubernetes clusters. The way an <code>app</code> is installed is by using its <a href="https://helm.sh/">helm</a> chart to generate YAML manifest files and then apply them. This process bypasses <code>tiller</code> completely, something which will be <a href="https://v3.helm.sh/">deprecated in helm 3</a>.</p>
<p>Install arkade, which is a Kubernetes app installer.</p>
<pre><code>curl -sLS https://dl.get-arkade.dev | sh
sudo install arkade /usr/local/bin/

arkade --help
</code></pre>
<h3 id="installnginxingresscontroller">Install nginx IngressController</h3>
<p>We need an <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/">IngressController</a> to use with cert-manager, so let's install <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx">nginx-ingress</a>.</p>
<pre><code>arkade install ingress-nginx
</code></pre>
<h3 id="installcertmanager">Install cert-manager</h3>
<pre><code>arkade install cert-manager
</code></pre>
<p>This command installs <a href="https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager">JetStack's cert-manager</a> using the helm chart, but without <code>tiller</code>.</p>
<h3 id="installopenfaas">Install openfaas</h3>
<pre><code>arkade install openfaas
</code></pre>
<p>This command <a href="https://www.openfaas.com/">installs OpenFaaS</a> using the helm chart, but without <code>tiller</code>. Try the output given by arkade to check the installation worked correctly.</p>
<h3 id="areyouonpubliccloud">Are you on public cloud?</h3>
<p>If you're running in your homelab, on-premises or with a Raspberry Pi cluster, then it's likely that you don't have a Public IP.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before creating an IP forwarding rule on your router, remember that you are exposing your location and ISP information to the world, there's a better way</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Get a public IP for ingress-nginx through inlets PRO and the inlets-operator:</p>
<pre><code>arkade install inlets-operator \
 --helm3 \
 --provider digitalocean \
 --region lon1 \
 --token-file ~/Downloads/digitalocean-api-key \
 --license-file ~/Downloads/inlets-pro-license.txt
</code></pre>
<p>The inlets-operator will create a public IP for you, and you can continue as if you were running on Public Cloud.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Get a <a href="https://inlets.dev/">free trial or purchase inlets PRO here</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="configureyouringress">Configure your Ingress</h3>
<p>Let's say that you have a domain called <code>example.com</code>. If you don't have a domain yet, just buy one from Google Domains or from <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap.com</a>. They start at under 2 USD, so there is no reason not to.</p>
<p>We'll use a sub-domain of <code>openfaas</code> so the full address would be: <code>openfaas.example.com</code>.</p>
<pre><code>export TOP_DOMAIN=example.com
export DOMAIN=openfaas.$TOP_DOMAIN

export EMAIL=webmaster@$DOMAIN
arkade install openfaas-ingress \
 --domain $DOMAIN \
 --email $EMAIL
</code></pre>
<p>This creates an Issuer with your email address and an Ingress record, which cert-manager will use to create your TLS certificate automatically.</p>
<h3 id="updateyourdnsrecord">Update your DNS record</h3>
<p>In order for the certificate to be issued, your new LoadBalancer created for Nginx needs to point at the domain name you used in the previous step i.e. <code>echo $DOMAIN</code>.</p>
<p>Now find the IP with <code>kubectl get svc</code> - you'll see Nginx has an EXTERNAL-IP.</p>
<ul>
<li>For EKS create a DNS CNAME record for the DNS entry given</li>
<li>For all other cluster create a DNS A record with the IP given</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have the DigitalOcean CLI installed <a href="https://github.com/digitalocean/doctl">doctl</a> then you can run:</p>
<pre><code>export IP="" # populate from above
doctl compute domain create $DOMAIN --ip-address $IP
</code></pre>
<h3 id="waitalittle">Wait a little</h3>
<p>You now need to wait for your DNS entry to propagate and for cert-manager to obtain a certificate.</p>
<p>Check how things are going with:</p>
<pre><code>kubectl logs deploy/cert-manager -n cert-manager -f
</code></pre>
<h3 id="logintoopenfaaswithtls">Log-in to OpenFaaS with TLS</h3>
<pre><code>export OPENFAAS_URL=https://$DOMAIN

PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret -n openfaas basic-auth -o jsonpath="{.data.basic-auth-password}" | base64 --decode; echo)

echo $PASSWORD | faas-cli login -s

faas-cli store deploy nodeinfo
faas-cli list -v

faas-cli invoke figlet
</code></pre>
<p>You can also open the OpenFaaS UI over an encrypted connection:</p>
<pre><code>echo Open a browser at https://$DOMAIN
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2019/10/Screenshot-2019-10-25-at-14.12.43.png" alt="Screenshot-2019-10-25-at-14.12.43"></p>
<h2 id="wrappingup">Wrapping up</h2>
<p>When I proposed that <code>arkade</code> should configure TLS for OpenFaaS in a single command, it was because I wanted to make the whole process less painful and repetitive, and to guard users from the many breaking changes we've seen in cert-manager over the course of the last 12 months.</p>
<p>I think I achieved that aim, but make up your own mind. Compare the following with the single line we typed in above:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full docs: <a href="https://docs.openfaas.com/reference/ssl/kubernetes-with-cert-manager/">Add TLS to OpenFaaS with cert-manager</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Interest in OpenFaaS and <code>arkade</code> is growing rapidly, so for me it's even more important that users have easy access to TLS certificates to encrypt their traffic.</p>
<p>If you'd like to see new "apps" (helm charts) supported in arkade, then let me know on the GitHub repository <a href="https://get-arkade.dev/">https://get-arkade.dev</a> and add your ⭐️ to show support.</p>
<p>Keep on learning:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="post-body"><p>I wanted to easily switch between my regular desktop configuration:
<img src="https://www.underkube.com/images/gnome-displays-argos/00-standard.jpg" alt="standard"></p><p>All the external displays:
<img src="https://www.underkube.com/images/gnome-displays-argos/01-externals.jpg" alt="externals"></p><p>To a single external display:
<img src="https://www.underkube.com/images/gnome-displays-argos/02-external-horizontal.jpg" alt="single-external"></p><p>Or just the laptop screen:
<img src="https://www.underkube.com/images/gnome-displays-argos/03-laptop.jpg" alt="laptop"></p><p>This usually required to open <code>gnome-control-center</code>, then click displays, etc.
<img src="https://www.underkube.com/images/gnome-displays-argos/gnome-control-center.png" alt="gnome-control-center"></p><p>So I thought it would be nice to look for a extension in the
<a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/">Gnome Extensions</a> site… but I couldn’t find
any that worked as I wanted… so let’s try to do our own method! :)</p><h2 id="argos">Argos</h2><p>Just in case you never heard of <a href="https://github.com/p-e-w/argos">Argos</a>, it is a
Gnome ‘metaextension’ where you can create your own extensions based on scripts,
commands, etc. It is inspired by, and fully compatible with, the
<a href="https://github.com/matryer/bitbar">BitBar</a> app for OSX.</p><p>In order to install it, you just need to go to its
<a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1176/argos/">the Gnome Extensions</a> page
and click on the “ON|OFF” button. Profit!</p><p>There are plenty of examples and useful argos/bitbar scripts out there so my
recomendation is to look for ‘prior art’ to inspire yourself on creating your
own extensions.</p><h2 id="xorg-or-wayland">Xorg or Wayland?</h2><p>I use Xorg instead of Wayland because I couldn’t find an alternative to
<code>xbindkeys</code> for Wayland to customize my
<a href="https://www.logitech.com/es-es/product/mx-master-2s-flow">MX Master 2S</a> mouse
keys. See
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Logitech_MX_Master#Xbindkeys">here</a> for
more information on how to do that, but basically, this is my <code>~/.xbindkeysrc</code>:</p><pre><code># thumb wheel up =&gt; increase volume
"xte 'key XF86AudioRaiseVolume'"
   b:8

# thumb wheel down =&gt; lower volume
"xte 'key XF86AudioLowerVolume'"
   b:9
</code></pre><h2 id="enter-xrandr-and-arandr">Enter xrandr and arandr</h2><p>tl;dr.- <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xrandr"><code>xrandr</code></a> is a cli tool to
manage displays using xorg while
<a href="https://christian.amsuess.com/tools/arandr/">arandr</a> is a nice GUI tool to
create <code>xrandr</code> “scripts” easily:</p><p><img src="https://www.underkube.com/images/gnome-displays-argos/arandr.png" alt="arandr screenshot"></p><p>Basically it generates <code>sh</code> scripts such as <code>~/.screenlayout/00-standard.sh</code>:</p><pre><code>#!/bin/sh
xrandr --output eDP-1 --mode 1920x1080 --pos 3000x420 --rotate normal --output DP-1 --off --output HDMI-1 --off --output DP-2 --off --output HDMI-2 --off --output DP-1-1 --primary --mode 1920x1080 --pos 0x420 --rotate normal --output DP-1-2 --mode 1920x1080 --pos 1920x0 --rotate left --output DP-1-3 --off
</code></pre><p>So I have a script for each of my setups:</p><pre><code>$ ls -1 ~/.screenlayout/
00-standard.sh
01-single-external.sh
02-only-external.sh
03-laptop.sh
04-vertical.sh
</code></pre><h2 id="argos-extension">Argos extension</h2><p>With everything in place, the argos extension is just this
<code>~/.config/argos/external_monitor.1r..sh</code> script:</p><pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "|iconName=video-display"
echo "---"

for i in $(find ~/.screenlayout/*.sh)
do
  # https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2664740/extract-file-basename-without-path-and-extension-in-bash
  file="${i##*/}"
  echo "${file%.*} | bash='${i}' terminal=false"
done
</code></pre><p>Which looks like:</p><p><img src="https://www.underkube.com/images/gnome-displays-argos/argos-screenshot.png" alt="argos screenshot"></p><p>Nice!!!</p></section></div>]]>

Mobile screen grab from Latvian national archive</p></div>


<p>From 2019 onwards the Latvian National Archive offers access to various KGB documents. The author had already previously shown the very detailed efforts of the Latvian KGB counterintelligence to monitor and study the CIA and BND numbers stations broadcasts, or what they called – “one directional communications”.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> These are one of the most definitive archival sources which prove that foreign intelligence actively used shortwave in the USSR and that the KGB was aware of it. The documents showed that the KGB had monitored these broadcasts from at least 1978, but the files spoke very vaguely if the monitoring effort led to any apprehension and capture of a foreign agent. We, however, know that there were such cases like Alexander Ogorodnik<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>, and others where the use of shortwave signals was determined.</p>
<p>The Latvian National Archive digitized operational cases and also special KGB training manuals. These manuals were published for inner agency use and were never issued in public because they contained secret information. One such manual called “<em>Некоторые вопросы организаций работы по сигналам и делам оперативного учета лиц причастий в шпионажу”</em> published in 1985 by KGB of F. E Dzherzhinsky in Moscow.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> (A few issues on organizing work on signals and cases recognizing persons taking part in espionage”). The manual was credited to major general A. A Fabrichinikov and colonel V.V Holopov The word “signal” in the title does not mean just a radio signal. In the KGB terminology “signal” meant a sign or report of a foreign intelligence or anti Soviet activity. If this “signal” indicated that the person is taking part in espionage he had to be investigated and evidence to be collected. The manual showed various historical cases as examples on how to apprehend and capture a foreign agent.</p>



<p>One such case was called” Case on Filatov”. Starting from page 41 the manual examples this case as one of the cases where radio communication was used between the agency and agent and how it was uncovered by counter intelligence. <strong>Anatoly N. Filatov</strong> was according to a 1981 Washington Post report sentenced in 1978 to be shot by a firing squad, though the sentence was commuted later to 15 years in prison.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> A New York Times article in 1980 had rumored that A. Filatov was the same “Trigon” who is now commonly known as Alexandr Ogorodnik. The article states that A. Filatov was suspected of being discovered by the KGB counterintelligence and forced to send the CIA false information. The reasoning behind this hypothesis was that in 1977 “Trigon” went dark at the same time as A. Filatov sent a very questionable cable about Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, where he questioned the “bargaining position of president Carter” during the 1977 missile control talks.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> Alexander Ogorodnik aka “Trigon” died on June 22 1977 after swallowing cyanide pills during a KGB break in.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>
<p>David E. Hoffman, author of the book “The Million Dollar Spy” states that Filatov was arrested during a “car toss”, where a package is quickly swapped between two passing cars.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> Russian author Aleksandr Kolpakidi in his book “The GRU Empire” writes that Filatov was born in 1940 in the Saratov district, joined the GRU in 1973. (GRU – the Main Intelligence Directorate – Soviet military intelligence agency) and served in Algiers where in 1974 he established contact with the CIA. Filatov had stated that his involvement with the adversary CIA happened as a result of being lured into a honey trap with a woman called Nadia, as similar happened to&nbsp; A. Ogorodnik. Either so or A. Filatov himself decided to become a double agent and started meeting CIA agent Edward Kane. In 1976 A. Filatov was called back to Moscow and the CIA had instructed him to receive shortwave coded broadcasts in German numbers from Frankfurt near Main, the broadcasts were to be carried out twice a week. Operative broadcast would be started with uneven numbers and training with even numbers. The broadcasts on precaution were carried out before A. Filatov returned to Moscow. The return message was to be carried out in a dead drop in an area near Dinamo sports stadium.</p>
<p>As the author states the coded messages contained such instructions: “Do not contain yourself with gathering information within your service only. Gain trust of friends and relatives. Visit them at their workplaces, their homes, invite them to restaurants, and with careful, clever talking gain information you could not get yourself”<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>. The instructions also stated that the agency is not just interested in documents with “Top Secret” on it but also common information about his department and situation in it. Filatov was arrested on the 2nd of September 1977. As A. Kolpakidi states he was first sentenced to death in 1978 but instead was sent to labor camp 389/35 near Perm. In 1989 Filatov was visited by French journalists to whom he stated that he took very high stakes risks in his life which he lost and now naturally pays for it.</p>
<p>After release he demanded compensation from the US embassy, but was denied as a non citizen. The Russian TV company TV Center in 2014 made the documentary series “Завербуй меня, если сможешь” (Contract me if you can) and featured the A. Filatov case showing various pictures of him and accounts from his colleagues, such as Anatoly Tereshchenko, colonel of the military counter intel. Tereshchenko stated that if A. Filatov had come to the GRU and reported that he was lured into cooperation with the CIA, they could outplay the CIA, and Filatov would be a hero.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> What became of Filatov after his release, is not known, the TV documentary showed his picture after his release. Possibly A. Filatov is dead now.</p>

<p>The case regarding American agent Filatov is particularly useful for agency and operative workers. Two agents who worked on this case had limited, but clear objectives: one controlled his work shifts, the other one lured him to a position within a GRU object (facility), where he was arrested. Secondary events were mostly carried out by the workers of the operational staff.</p>
<p>In the case materials the use of operational technical and criminal resources is very clearly displayed. The workers of the operational services had a clear objective: gain information about practical espionage activity.</p>
<p>A lot of support for apprehending the spy was provided by the GRU radio counterintelligence. During the first phase of the operation the counter radio intelligence played a helpful, but mostly backseat role, in terms of gaining radio information. However, after Filatov was discovered in possession of multiple ciphers the RCI<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> played the most active role in gaining information about the adversary’s plans for their agent. It must be asserted that the RCI data about the new communication line only gained importance after comprehensive analysis about known agents and data gained from agency postal communication lines.</p>
<p>It is useful to take note of the surveillance tactics used to monitor&nbsp; FIlatov, during all phases of the operation. Here the artistic use of surveillance, determination of the personality of the object, working out on his work conditions and living place (such an approach is essential for any future attempts for apprehending an adversary agent).</p>
<p>Finally it’s important to point out the very high level of secrecy is required to successfully&nbsp; carry out the operation, with minimal numbers&nbsp; of agents and operative staff workers as reglamented by the authority of KGB, and adjusted fully to the set parameters.</p>
<p>All this taken to an account assured that the case was carried out in highest quality the tasks were carried out decisively.</p>
<p>“””</p>
<p>The investigation into the incoming signals, and the timeline for the search for the CIA agent Filatov took place in the following order.</p>
<p>At the start of 1977 the second chief directorate of the KGB had received data that led to the belief that a new agent from American intelligence had become active within Soviet Union.</p>
<p>On January 21 and February 6 1977 the RCI had detected the transmission of operational (combat)<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> radiograms on the communication line sent from Frankfurt CIA radio center, that had appeared already in the first half of 1976.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> With that the general reception of the radiograms was possible within the central part of European side of the USSR. <a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>
<p>In this same timeframe espionage activity within CIA station inside the US embassy in Moscow, was observed to have increased, showing signs of preparing for creating operational dead drop communications, it was determined that these activities could not be part of the ongoing cases and operational games.</p>
<p>It was expected that the agent, after receiving operational radiograms, will likely make contact with the Frankfurt radio center using postal telegraph, telephone, dead drop, radio transmission or make a meeting with his handler, usually from US diplomatic service.</p>
<p>Taking this into account together with Operative-technical and Seventh authority of the KGB, extra measures were made to control the agency channels within Moscow and eavesdrop on CIA actions.</p>
<p>On February 9 1977 a postal parcel coming from Moscow to the US, a suspicious letter was identified which had signs which made its purpose likely being for espionage uses. This letter had a date indicating it was sent on February 7 and was written in the in English language “from English tourist”<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>. By using a physical-chemical method on the blank side of the letter, a cipher of 353 five number …</p></div></div>

	<p>
		<em>The software industry loves young people, but old-timers serve an important purpose, too.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		Our culture idolises youth. There's several reasons for this, I believe. Youth seems synonymous with vigour, strength, beauty, and many other desirable qualities. The cynical perspective is that young people, while rebellious, also tend to be easy to manipulate, if you know which buttons to push. A middle-aged man like me isn't susceptible to the argument that I should buy a particular pair of Nike shoes because they're named after Michael Jordan, but for a while, one pair wasn't enough for my teenage daughter.
	</p>
	<p>
		In intellectual pursuits (like software development), youth is often extolled as the source of innovation. You're often confronted with examples like that of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89variste_Galois">Évariste Galois</a>, who made all his discoveries before turning 21. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a> was around 28 years when she produced what is considered the 'first computer program'. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a> was 24 when he wrote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing%27s_proof">On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Clearly, young age is no detriment to making ground-breaking contributions. It has even become folklore that everyone past the age of 35 is a has-been whose only chance at academic influence is to write a textbook.
	</p>
	<h3 id="800321a74c054ea0b75815c86f4ce18d">
		The story of the five monkeys <a href="#800321a74c054ea0b75815c86f4ce18d" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		You may have seen a story called <em>the five monkeys experiment</em>. It's most likely a fabrication, but it goes like this:
	</p>
	<p>
		A group of scientists placed five monkeys in a cage, and in the middle, a ladder with bananas on the top. Every time a monkey went up the ladder, the scientists soaked the rest of the monkeys with cold water. After a while, every time a monkey went up the ladder, the others would beat it up.
	</p>
	<p>
		After some time, none of the monkeys dared go up the ladder regardless of the temptation. The scientists then substituted one of the monkeys with a new one, who'd immediately  go for the bananas, only to be beaten up by the others. After several beatings, the new member learned not to climb the ladder even though it never knew why.
	</p>
	<p>
		A second monkey was substituted and the same occurred. The first monkey participated in beating the second. A third monkey was exchanged and the story repeated. The fourth was substituted and the beating was repeated. Finally the fifth monkey was replaced.
	</p>
	<p>
		Left was a group of five monkeys who, even though they never received a cold shower, continued to beat up any monkey who attempted to climb the ladder. If it was possible to ask the monkeys why they would beat up all who attempted to go up the ladder, the answer would probably be:
	</p>
	<p>
		"That's how we do things here."
	</p>
	<p>
		While the story is probably just that: a story, it tells us something about the drag induced by age and experience. If you've been in the business for decades, you've seen numerous failed attempts at something you yourself tried when you were young. You know that it can't be done.
	</p>
	<p>
		Young people don't know that a thing can't be done. If they can avoid the monkey-beating, they'll attempt the impossible.
	</p>
	<h3 id="4add8a9af0424d7e889d3125837ed611">
		Changing circumstances <a href="#4add8a9af0424d7e889d3125837ed611" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Is attempting the impossible a good idea?
	</p>
	<p>
		In general, no, because it's... impossible. There's a reason older people tell young people that a thing can't be done. It's not just because they're stodgy conservatives who abhor change. It's because they see the effort as wasteful. Perhaps they're even trying to be kind, guiding young people off a path where only toil and disappointment is to be found.
	</p>
	<p>
		What old people don't realise is that sometimes, circumstances change.
	</p>
	<p>
		What was impossible twenty years ago may not be impossible today. We see this happening in many fields. Producing a commercially viable electric car was impossible for decades, until, with the advances made in battery technology, it became possible.
	</p>
	<p>
		Technology changes rapidly in software development. People trying something previously impossible may find that it's possible today. Once, if you had lots of data, you had to store it in fully normalised form, because storage was expensive. For a decade, relational databases were the only game in town. Then circumstances changed. Storage became cheaper, and a new movement of NoSQL storage emerged. What was before impossible became possible.
	</p>
	<p>
		Older people often don't see the new opportunities, because they 'know' that some things are impossible. Young people push the envelope driven by a combination of zest and ignorance. Most fail, but a few succeed.
	</p>
	<h3 id="4272a069588e47f796646bd282b9de02">
		Lottery of the impossible <a href="#4272a069588e47f796646bd282b9de02" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		I think of this process as a lottery. Imagine that every impossible thing is a red ball in an urn. Every young person who tries the impossible draws a random ball from the urn.
	</p>
	<p>
		The urn contains millions of red balls, but every now and then, one of them turns green. You don't know which one, but if you draw it, it represents something that was previously impossible which has now become possible.
	</p>
	<p>
		This process produces growth, because once discovered, the new and better way of doing things can improve society in general. Occasionally, the young discoverer may even gain some fame and fortune.
	</p>
	<p>
		It seems wasteful, though. Most people who attempt the impossible will reach the predictable conclusion. What was deemed impossible was, indeed, impossible.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I'm in a cynical mood, I don't think that it's youth in itself that is the source of progress. It's just the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers">law of large numbers</a> applied. If there's a one in million chance that something will succeed, but ten million people attempt it, it's only a matter of time before one succeeds.
	</p>
	<p>
		Society at large can benefit from the success of the few, but ten million people still wasted their efforts.
	</p>
	<h3 id="016744f0ea77495c958a7914f08187db">
		We need the old, too <a href="#016744f0ea77495c958a7914f08187db" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		If you accept the argument that young people are more likely to try the impossible, we need the young people. Do we need the old people?
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm turning fifty in 2020. You may consider that old, but I expect to work for many more years. I don't know if the software industry needs fifty-year-olds, but that's not the kind of old I have in mind. I'm thinking of people who have retired, or are close to retirement.
	</p>
	<p>
		In our youth-glorifying culture, we tend to dismiss the opinion and experiences of old people. <em>Oh, well, it's just a codgy old man</em> (or woman), we'll say.
	</p>
	<p>
		We ignore the experience of the old, because we believe that they haven't been keeping up with times. Their experiences don't apply to us, because we live under new circumstance. Well, see above.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm not advocating that we turn into a gerontocracy that venerates our elders solely because of their age. Again, according to the law of large numbers, some people live to old age. There need not be any correlation between survivors and wisdom.
	</p>
	<p>
		We need the old to tell us the truth, because they have little to lose.
	</p>
	<h3 id="8b5c613ba6c44bb4b4e6dbba7ae7d19a">
		Nothing to lose <a href="#8b5c613ba6c44bb4b4e6dbba7ae7d19a" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		In the last couple of years, I've noticed a trend. A book comes out, exposing the sad state of affairs in some organisation. This has happened regularly in Denmark, where I live. One book may expose the deplorable conditions of the Danish tax authorities, one may describe the situation in the ministry of defence, one criticises the groupthink associated with the climate crisis, and so on.
	</p>
	<p>
		Invariably, it turns out that the book is written by a professor emeritus or a retired department head.
	</p>
	<p>
		I don't think that these people, all of a sudden, had an epiphany after they retired. They knew all about the rot in the system they were part of, while they were part of it, but they've had too much to lose. You could argue that they should have said something before they retired, but that requires a moral backbone we can't expect most people to have.
	</p>
	<p>
		When people retire, the threat of getting fired disappears. Old people can speak freely to a degree most other people can't.
	</p>
	<p>
		Granted, many may simply use that freedom to spew bile or shout <em>Get off my lawn!</em>, but many are in the unique position to reveal truths no-one else dare speak. Many are, perhaps, just bitter, but some may possess knowledge that they are in a unique position to reveal.
	</p>
	<p>
		When that grumpy old guy on Twitter writes something that makes you uncomfortable, consider this: he may still be right.
	</p>
	<h3 id="2d64bd2c7ccb4b7ca2418802ed82689e">
		Being unreasonable <a href="#2d64bd2c7ccb4b7ca2418802ed82689e" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		In a way, you could say that we need young and old people for the same fundamental reason. Not all of them, but enough of them, are in a position to be unreasonable.
		</p><blockquote>
			<p>
				"The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man."
			</p>
			
		</blockquote><p>
		Young people and old people are unreasonable in each their own way, and we need both.
	</p>
	<h3 id="df88f595ec814e2bafcbd018ff5f5ad2">
		Conclusion <a href="#df88f595ec814e2bafcbd018ff5f5ad2" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		We need young people in the software development industry. Because of their vigour and inexperience, they'll push the envelope. Most will fail to do the impossible, but a few succeed.
	</p>
	<p>
		This may seem like a cynical view, but we've all been young, and most of us have been through such a phase. It's like a rite of passage, and even if you fail to make your mark on the world, you're still likely to have learned a lot.
	</p>
	<p>
		We need old people because they're in a position to speak truth to the world. Notice that I didn't make my argument about the <em>experience</em> of old-timers. Actually, I find that valuable as well, but that's the ordinary argument: <em>Listen to old people, because they have experience and wisdom.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		Some of them do, at least.
	</p>
	<p>
		I didn't make much out of that argument, because you already know it. There'd be no reason to write this essay if that was all I had to say. Old people have less on the line, so they can speak more freely. If someone you used to admire retires and all of a sudden starts saying or writing unpleasant and surprising things, there might be a good explanation, and it might be a good idea to pay attention.
	</p>
	<p>
		Or …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article aria-label="Microsoft Teams as a platform" itemref="hero-page-title"><div>
<p>2020 became the year of #WFH (work from home) and for many organizations also the turning point when Microsoft Teams became the primary place where being “at work” happens. This is accelerating the evolution of Teams from being merely a communication tool that connects human beings into a foundational service layer for many types of business applications.</p>



<p>How the concept of Teams as a platform contrasts with Microsoft’s Power Platform suite of technology is something I’ve been thinking about a lot lately. In this post I’ll first reflect on the relatively short history of where Teams came from. I’ll then examine how the recent feature announcements are brining apps front &amp; center in Teams. Finally, a few words on the possible future for Teams as part of Microsoft’s broader strategy.</p>



<h2>The road that lead to Teams</h2>



<p>Looking back ~10 years, the real-time communication &amp; instant messaging tools from MS seemed to be going through an endless renaming cycle: from OCS to Lync to Skype for Business. The core feature set presented to the end user didn’t seem to evolve nearly as much as product branding did. On a broader level, the communication activities of information workers within an organization still typically took place within Outlook’s inbox, and different servers like SharePoint and Dynamics CRM all packed their own features for posting short messages to other users.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>4 years ago, when the first images of what was then called “Skype Teams” started to leak out, we were already waiting for MS to create something a bit more ambitious than just another online meeting tool. Office Groups had began to emerge in various different places inside the MS Cloud, but they were primarily a technical construct with no sensible UX for everyday people to approach them. Even Dynamics CRM had it’s own solution that attempted to bring together the dicussion, calendars, notes, documents and team memberships from under an Office 365 Group associated with a record like account or opportunity:</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/basics/collaborate-with-colleagues-using-office-365-groups" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/basics/media/office-groups-dashboard.png" alt=""></a></figure></div>



<p>I remember having many discussions with our CRM customers where I attempted to steer people away from deploying this Groups solution. Instead I wanted to encourage them to wait for something a bit more polished that I knew had to be on it’s way sooner or later.</p>



<p>At one point there was a clear &amp; present danger of another “Yammer moment” taking place, as Microsoft was reportedly quite serious about their plans to acquire Slack. In retrospect it was a blessing for both parties that MS decided to keep investing in building their own product, instead of trying to retrofit an established service like Slack into their existing software offering.</p>



<p>I would argue that this “build over buy” strategy which Microsoft has since then followed across their business software stack has been a key success factor for BizApps in particular.  It has enabled MS to move from merely chasing CRM competitors like Salesforce into redefining the business apps playing field with Power Platform. There’s a stark difference between acquiring companies and bundling them as “X Cloud” versus engineering your own software stack to act as a true platform.</p>



<h2>Teams: the collaboration chapter</h2>



<p>Initially the first version of the Microsoft Teams product that became generally available in Spring 2017 was pretty much focused on being three things: </p>



<ol><li>Replacement for Skype for Business</li><li>Alternative to Slack</li><li>UI layer for Office 365 Groups</li></ol>



<p>From a business applications perspective there wasn’t all that much you could do to hook Teams up with Dynamics 365, until Fall 2018 when the previews for the first integrated features were launched. In particular the integrated file sharing experience that Teams offered seemed almost like the Holy Grail for many CRM professionals, offering to fix the glaring hole in the SharePoint integration story that lacked any security model synchronization. The roadmap image below presents the plans from 2 years ago on how Teams and Dynamics 365 were going to be integrated:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The last item on the roadmap has still not been delivered, which is the visibility of Teams conversations inside the Dynamics 365 record form. Why this hasn’t been a higher priority for MS to implement seems to me like a sign of how Microsoft Teams is nowadays positioned as the primary UI for all information work. MS probably would prefer if everything always started from inside Teams. You pin record tabs into channels, you show previews of records inside teams discussions, you interact with records via bot interfaces and so on. As long as Teams is that big umbrella under which all work takes place.</p>



<p>The lack of a deep 2-way integration does not therefore mean that investments aren’t being made into the products involved. It can simply be a reflection of the new vision that is being built, by aligning many existing services to form a whole that aims to be greater than the sum of its parts.</p>



<p>As an example, if you look at Microsoft’s task management story, you’ll see that features and data from across various apps like To Do, Planner and Outlook tasks / flagged emails are currently being collapsed into a central location that is the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/manage-tasks-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tasks app for Teams</a>. Tasks as a generic construct don’t necessarily need to be fully controlled by a single database, yet they very much need to be logically represented within “the hub for teamwork” that Teams is positioned as.</p>



<p>Going forward, when new apps appear into the MS cloud product portfolio and they need to offer task management features to users, the logical integration point to focus on would be Teams. For activity feed type of functionality the choice is even more clear for product development: choose to piggyback on Teams instead of inventing yet another stream of short messages.</p>



<h2>Teams: the platform chapter</h2>



<p>Moving beyond simply integrating Teams with products X, Y and Z, we’re now seeing the rise of a model where apps are built specifically to be used in Teams. This has of course been possible for a long time already, by developing custom web services and using the SDKs. Now there are many features coming up that will amplify the platform story around Teams on the no-code/low-code front specifically.</p>



<figure><img src="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/215495iAC8095B3BF8D5E46/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999" alt="lists in teams1.png"></figure>



<p>Microsoft Lists app has been the  first to <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/microsoft-lists-in-microsoft-teams-is-now-generally-available/ba-p/1621979" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reach GA</a> and offers an ultra low barrier for users to process data in a single table through a configurable, readymade UI. When accessed via Teams, the list data gains one more special dimension: discussions to be had regarding a list item. This is pretty much the same as the usage pattern offered for a Dynamics 365 record with the integration mentioned earlier.</p>



<p>Underneath the new covers of MS Lists is the technology familiar from SharePoint lists. If we were to only examine the UI layer, there is actually a remarkable similarity to a popular no-code service called Airtable. So much that the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://mspoweruser.com/airtable-accuses-microsoft-of-copying-its-service/" target="_blank">accusations</a> of MS simply copying the visuals and core features from this competitor don’t seem entirely unjustified. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://jukkaniiranen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Airtable_for_teams.png" alt="" width="583" height="729" srcset="https://jukkaniiranen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Airtable_for_teams.png 777w, https://jukkaniiranen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Airtable_for_teams-240x300.png 240w, https://jukkaniiranen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Airtable_for_teams-768x961.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px"></figure>



<p>Comparing these two offerings gives us some perspective on what exactly is the market position these tools are aiming to conquer. Simple lists themselves are not a particularly unique feature, rather it’s the team collaboration capabilities and ease of data sharing that turns these tables into what you’d call an actual app. Incidentally, just this week Airtable <a href="https://blog.airtable.com/airtable-platform-launch-automations-sync-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> they were building a full platform with apps offering JavaScript based extensibility, a marketplace for sharing apps, automations for executing business logic, and finally a sync service to transfer data across environments (“bases”).</p>



<p>Collaboration scenarios around semi-structured data like lists and Excel style tables can be seen as a  gateway drug. They allow turning email or paper based manual processes into a quick first draft of what the digital process could be like. If there are indeed clear business benefits in automating the said process, the requirements for more complex app features will soon begin to emerge from the user base. Hence the collaboration platform should offer an obvious path to grow these pre-built app experiences into more advanced no-code/low-code apps.</p>



<h2>Project Oakdale a.k.a bringing CDS to Teams</h2>



<p>If Microsoft Lists is the equivalent of an Excel table within the Teams context, then <a href="https://jukkaniiranen.com/2020/07/dataflex-is-more-and-less-than-cds/">Project Oakdale</a> / “CDS Lite” could be though of as bringing SQL Server inside Teams. Now, obviously Microsoft has zero intent on actually replacing Excel nor SQL with features built into Teams. They only need to introduce those parts that make sense from a team collabocation perspective.</p>



<p>Microsoft Lists is a far cry from what a real Excel workbook can do, yet it can offer much more value in a collaboration scenarios that those lone .xlsx files ever could. Similarly, the version of CDS that will very soon be available for building Power Apps within Teams is nowhere near as powerful as the services powering enterprise CRM systems like Dynamics 365 (or the raw power offered by SQL). Still, the fact that it can be found from within every team and used by a much larger audience than what Power Apps citizen developer tools could hope to capture – those are the factors that can truly make CDS a mainstream service that most information workers in the Microsoft 365 cloud interact it.</p>

<p>The experience of defining the CDS data model in Project Oakdale will be very different from the path that Power Apps makers have gone through – let alone the XRM veterans. In fact, you could easily mistake the table design and row entry UX to be that of Microsoft Lists rather than CDS. This highlights a key aspect that not all Power Platform experts may yet have grasped: for MS this “CDS Lite” is not so much about deciding what premium features of the full Power Platform to give away for free to Teams subscibers – rather it’s about how to best simplify the enterprise CRM features of CDS into a new product that Teams users could adopt on their own.</p>

		<p>Sometimes you encounter a striking figure of speech, comparison or just a metaphor that illustrates some concept in a much better way than anything you knew until now. It's so good you can't let it get unnoticed. In my case, it happened e.g. when I've learned to think about architects as "navigators". Or quite recently, while I was reading a very decent book by <a href="https://twitter.com/rands">Michael Lopp</a> - <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50083106-the-art-of-leadership">"The Art of Leadership: Small Things, Done Well"</a>.</p><p>Speaking about the latter: my epiphany moment happened during chapter IV, entirely dedicated to the author's actionable advice for engineering leaders. The concluding one was about a reasonable alternative to micro-management: Lopp calls it ... <em>"tasting the soup"</em>. And I think it's brilliant and 100% spot-on.</p><p><strong>Tasting the soup</strong> - what does it mean?</p><p>Imagine a professional chef. A chief boss-cook. A reigning monarch of the kitchen (e.g. in a top-notch, highly reputed, Michelin-starred restaurant). (S)he is the person accountable for the quality of the holistic culinary experience here. It's his(/her) reputation at stake if customers are dissatisfied (for any reason). But still, it doesn't mean (s)he does all the job him(/her)self (to guarantee a suitable level of quality) - quite the opposite. There's the talented, hand-picked crew doing all the "dirty" work, while the chef-in-charge:</p><ul><li>tastes</li><li>probes</li><li>verifies</li></ul><p>It's not that (s)he cares only about the final outcome - the 100% ready dish. (S)he engages <u>at all the various stages</u> (of meal preparation): by inspecting raw materials, half-cooked ingredients, nearly ready products about to get the final touch. &nbsp;What's more - the soup is <u>"multi-dimensional"</u> - it has several equally important aspects (to assess separately): consistency, smell, color, temperature, sweetness, bitterness, spiciness, etc.</p><p>Needless to say - the chef can't (&amp; shouldn't) be everywhere, all the time. (S)he <strong>can't assist every elementary activity</strong> - which is good and ... desirable. One <u>should not judge</u> the effect by the activities performed (which are - in many cases - meaningful "implementation" details or just elements of a highly-individualized style) but <strong>by the outcomes and how they match expectations </strong>(stated beforehand).</p><p>That's why (s)he restrains her(/him)self <u>to taste and probe</u> - it's sufficient because of <strong>past, practical experience</strong>. Precisely because of her/his experience, (s)he knows what to expect, whether the chosen direction is correct, whether there's a chance the final product will be edible &amp; satisfactory (aka will meet the given success criteria). (S)he's been there, (s)he's seen that. And as the one who knows what to expect, the chef is more probably able to detect all those very early warning lights and propose corrective actions.</p><p>Let me emphasize it again - micro-managing all the actions is not the way. Even with experience - <strong>it's NOT possible to know all the correct paths</strong>. Never ever. The number (of correct, good enough options) is endless.</p><p>I hope you've already figured it out by yourself - this chef soup tasting story can be easily mapped onto engineering management scenarios. Everything that has been said about the chef above can be directly translated into software development leaders' reality — starting with the role of experience and the importance of probing the effects (the current state of - process, tooling, various stages of deliverable completeness).</p><p>The default mode of an engineering manager's work should NOT be to dive deep into every possible (implementation) detail - it's just not feasible (but necessary in carefully chosen, critical situations that demand a more direct approach because of some warning lights flashing). A good engineering manager has to be able to:</p><ul><li>quickly orient her(/him)self in a situational context</li><li>identify the qualities that need to be assessed at this point</li><li>find a way to inspect them efficiently and objectively</li><li>confront the perceived learnings with expectations and past experience of similar endeavors</li></ul><p>In other words - to <em>"taste the engineering soup"</em>.</p><p>I think this metaphor is useful not just in calibrating your efforts (as an engineer manager), but also (as it's very "visual") can be very helpful in clarifying the meaning and importance of the engineering manager role: why is it needed, what value does it provide and what kind of input can one expect from a person bearing such a role.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>While cleaning out some old cartons last weekend, I found my old Raspberry Pi Model B+. It is the first iteration of the Pi. It has a 700MHz ARM CPU and 512MB of RAM. It uses a micro-SD card for non-volatile storage. So as you can see, it is quite a capable little computer, and you can power it off a standard 5V USB charger, which means you can run it all the time without worrying about power consumption.</p>

<p>I decided to track my home internet speed to see if my ISP is ripping me off 😉. Here’s how I did it.</p>

<h2 id="measuring-speed-on-raspberry-pi">Measuring speed on Raspberry Pi</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.speedtest.net/">Speedtest.net</a> has an <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli">official CLI client</a> that you can install directly using <code>apt</code>. It selects the best server automatically and reports the download and upload speed, along with the latency of your connection.</p>

<p>Then it’s simple to chart the speeds and latency over the roughly 24-hour period.</p>

<p><img src="https://perryizgr8.github.io/images/speedtest.png" alt="Speed test chart"></p>

<h2 id="problem-in-the-setup">Problem in the setup</h2>
<p>This chart shows that my download speed varies between 20 to 35Mbps, and the upload varies between 15 to 20Mbps. This is significantly lower than the 100Mbps symmetric I pay for. If you go back to the first test result I showed in this post, which I ran from my laptop, it shows 83Mbps download and 60Mbps upload. So why this discrepancy?</p>

<p>I suspect this is where my old Pi is showing its age. Even though it is connected to my router using a 100Mbps ethernet cable, the hardware is simply not powerful enough to fully saturate the connection. So I will not be running this setup anymore. Maybe one day I’ll get a newer model and run this for a longer duration. That would hopefully reveal some interesting patterns.</p>

<p>Another concern of mine is the amount of data transfered. Each run of the test consumes around 60MB of data. Running it every half hour for a month would use up ~85GB. That is close to 17% of my plan’s monthly quota. That would probably push me over the limit and cause the connection to slow down to something unusable like 1Mbps.</p>

        <p>Throughout my engineering career (Semiconductor industry), I've come across dozens if not hundreds of equipment suppliers. But there are a few suppliers that leave a long lasting impression. Thorlabs is one of them. Why?</p><p>It is quite silly actually. Everytime I order a linear actuator, motorized stage or axis controller... something that's just normal industrial hardware, it ships unremarkably with billable weight in hundreds of dollars, docks and sits at the shipping &amp; receiving until I haul it into the lab. Cut open the box, and you see this:</p><figure><img src="https://neil.computer/content/images/2020/09/image.png" alt=""><figcaption>Source: https://jlfenimore.wixsite.com/jenniferfenimore/lab-snacks</figcaption></figure><p>Food and Drink are not allowed in our lab, except when it comes to the Thorlabs Snacks. This little red box brings so much joy it is hard to describe. Thorlabs shipping boxes contain one or more of these red boxes, it's got - cookies, candies, granola bars, chips, etc. to put a smile on the face. They didn't have to do it but they did. And they've been doing this for many years. Infact, they've trademarked "Lab Snacks" which is such a cool name on its own!</p><p>Thorlabs founder, Alex Cable, wrote an <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/about_us.cfm">article</a> about his vision of what customer centricity is, there is so much to learn from it, Wikipedia quotes:</p><blockquote>An important part of Thorlabs' brand and culture is Lab Snacks. Lab Snacks were created to support the famished grad student researching all night, serving as an occasional meal for someone hard at work.</blockquote><p>I implore you to read the original <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/about_us.cfm">source</a> because it exemplifies what a CEO and Founder should do to build an honest, customer centric business and how to genuinely connect with them. Everything at Thorlabs, from their phone support to documentation, is focusing on how best to make you, the customer, successful. Therein lies their success and they double-down on it.</p><p>Thorlabs has left such a long-lasting impact on me that I am writing this post after last enjoying Lab Snacks 2 years ago.</p>

We will use a simple TfidfVectorizer to convert the text into vector format and run KMeans Clustering Algorithm on the vectorized form of the search queries to generate clusters</p><pre>import pandas as pd

</pre><p>Google Search Console allows us to download around 1000 keywords and with the above method we have been able to cluster similar search queries together. Now it’ss time to map the clusters to well defined topics.</p><p>Next we will assign a topic label to each cluster by looking at the terms which the Clustering Algorithm has provided us. Here are the manually assigned topics.</p><pre>topic_map = {
    0: 'Multi Class Classification',
    1: 'iOS Sharing (How To)',
    2: 'iOS Charts',
    3: 'iOS BarCode and Inventory Management',
    4: 'Multi Class Classification',
    5: 'iOS UI TableViews',
    6: 'How to make an app series',
    7: 'Core Data &amp; Swift',
    8: 'Apple Pay',
    9: 'Implement Search in iOS',
    10: 'UITableViews &amp; Layouts',
    11: 'iOS HealthKit',
    12: 'Core Data',
    13: 'Build by example: Uber',
    14: 'iOS Step Counter App',
    15: 'iOS UI TableViews',
    16: 'Swift Search Bar',
    17: 'AWS Serverless',
    18: 'Notifications / Alerts Swift',
    19: 'Word Vectors'    
}
</pre><p>Next we will use the model to predict the cluster label to each of the search query we got from the google search console data.</p><pre># This will generate labels from 0 to 19 and we will use the map above to map it to readable cluster labels

df['cluster'] = model.predict(vectorizer.transform(df.Query))

df['cluster_label'] = df.cluster.map(topic_map)

# Next create the ctr from Click and impression data
df['ctr'] = df.Clicks/df.Impressions

# Find the topic cluster on your site which are converting the best and also the topic which get impression but doesn't convert well.
df['ctr'] = df.Clicks/df.Impressions
df.groupby('cluster_label')[['ctr', 'Impressions']].mean().reset_index().sort_values('ctr', ascending=False)

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It is always difficult to choose a tech stack for your application. Especially one that is going to be worked on by many people in the future. The fact that technologies like Javascript change almost on a daily basis and new frameworks come up every time I browse the internet does not make this job any easier.<br></p><p>On one hand you want to be using the latest technologies available but on the other hand you can’t afford to have a high learning curve or use something that is not a 100% stable yet because you are most likely going to build a long term business that must stand the test of time.<br></p><p>In many ways it is similar to choosing a person to date. You wanna go with the best looking one but you also need the person to have some depth so that you can have a long term relationship!<br></p><p>So how do you choose the right tech stack? I can’t say for sure that the methods that am employing are the best ones and readers can always reach out to me on twitter and correct me but here are some of the things that I am keeping in mind right now<br></p><h3><strong>Prioritising speed over “doing the right thing”</strong><br></h3><p>It is important for a startup to move fast. If I spend time learning new technologies and understanding all the nuances of those technologies it might take a long time to actually build a product and get it out the door. <br></p><p>For instance, I am currently building a <a href="https://www.delight.chat/" target="_blank">customer support software for e-commerce businesses</a> and I have been advised by a few folks that my use case would involve dealing with a lot of unstructured data so MongoDB is the right database to use. <br></p><p>The issue here is that I do not have much experience with nosql and I have personally never used it in production. So even if this is the right thing, it might end up causing me a lot of grief down the line when I am not able to debug certain issues just because I don’t have a deeper understanding of the subject. <br></p><p>I decided to go with Postgres instead because while being a relational database which I am comfortable with, Postgres supports a datatype called JSONB where you can store unstructured data much like in Mongo. This seemed like the optimal thing to do.<br></p><h3><strong>Other people will be working on your codebase</strong><br></h3><p>I my previous venture, I wrote some services in Golang. I did this because I enjoy writing code in Go, not to mention that it is a compiled language with syntax that is easy to understand and yields performance that is close to C/C++.<br></p><p>This seemed like a good idea at the time because the services I wrote in Go were highly scalable and I did not have to touch them again for a long time. The issue came up when we exited the business and I had to transfer the codebase to folks who never worked in Golang. <br></p><p>The same thing could happen when you hire new folks who might have great aptitude for the role but do not necessarily know all the nuances of working with a brand new language. This is going to delay development time significantly.<br></p><h3><strong>Do not spend time on solved problems </strong><br></h3><p>The amount of work required to build your core product is already quite high, you don’t want to be making it worse by spending valuable development hours on building things that are not core to your product.<br></p><p>For our current product we needed a socket infrastructure so that the server can push real time updates to the browser when a certain event takes place. At first I thought of using something like <a href="http://socket.io/" target="_blank">socket.io</a> but after giving it some further thought, I realised that it would take up considerable bandwidth to maintain the socket service as the product scales in usage.<br></p><p>We decided to cough up some $$ and go with <a href="http://pusher.com/" target="_blank">pusher.com</a> instead. They are a SaaS that offer socket infrastructure as a service. If their entire business depends on one particular pain point, it is safe to assume that they would have done the best possible job of handling it and would have found out all the edge cases and bugs that might come up. <br></p><h3><strong>Break up the product into microservices</strong><br></h3><p>For a monolithic codebase there is pretty much no choice but to work on the same language and frameworks for the foreseeable future. This means that not only are you stuck with a tech stack that you choose a long time ago, but even the folks you hire in the future will be stuck working on the same thing as well.<br></p><p>To prevent this, it is important to segregate your product into micro services that can be developed, maintained and deployed independently so that you can easily swap some of these services with new ones written in a new language or framework without affecting the working of the rest of the product.<br></p><h3><strong>Closing notes</strong><br></h3><p>While speed is important, it is also important to make sure that your employees are comfortable with the tech stack and do not feel like their careers are being jeopardised due to not being able to work on the latest technologies and frameworks that are available in the market. It would not be fair for me to say that we will only use PHP and nothing else and whoever joins us must suck it up and work on it. <br></p><p>It could also negatively impact us if we miss out on the ease of problem solving that new technologies and frameworks provide. So there must always be balance &nbsp;between speed and upgrading yourself to something new and better. <br></p><p>So if you find yourself in a position where there is a new technology that can make things significantly better but it would require a learning curve and a considerable risk of not being able to find employees who can work on this technology very easily, it might still be worth to go for it.</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

<h2 id="experimental-performance-features-for-cluster-mode-on-mri">Experimental Performance Features For Cluster Mode on MRI</h2>
<p>This is probably the headline of the release - two features for reducing memory usage, and one for reducing latency.</p>
<p>Puma 5 contains 3 new experimental performance features:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>wait_for_less_busy_worker</code> config. This may reduce latency on MRI through inserting a small delay (sleep sort!) before re-listening on the socket if worker is busy. Intended result: If enabled, should reduce latency in high-load (&gt;50% utilization) Puma clusters.</li>
<li><code>fork_worker</code> option and <code>refork</code> command for reduced memory usage by forking from a worker process instead of the master process. Intended result: If enabled, should reduce memory usage.</li>
<li>Added <code>nakayoshi_fork</code> config option. Reduce memory usage in preloaded cluster-mode apps by GCing before fork and compacting, where available. Intended result: If enabled, should reduce memory usage.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these experiments are only for <strong>cluster mode</strong> Puma configs running on <strong>MRI</strong>.</p>
<p>We’re calling them <em>experimental</em> because we’re not sure if they’ll actually have any benefit. We’re pretty sure they’re stable and won’t break anything, but we’re not sure they’re actually going to have big benefits in the real world. People’s workloads are often not what we anticipate, and synthetic benchmarks are usually not of any help in figuring out if a change will be beneficial or not.</p>
<p>We do not believe any of the new features will have a negative effect or impact the stability of your application. This is either a “it works” or “it does nothing” experiment.</p>
<p>If any of the features turn out to be particularly beneficial, we may make them defaults in future versions of Puma.</p>
<p><strong>If you upgrade and try any of the 3 new features, please post before and after results or screenshots to <a href="https://github.com/puma/puma/issues/2258">this Github issue</a>.</strong> “It didn’t do anything” is still a useful report in this case. Posting ~24 hours of “before” and ~24 hours of “after” data would be most helpful.</p>
<h3 id="wait_for_less_busy_worker-sleep-sort-for-faster-apps">wait_for_less_busy_worker: sleep sort for faster apps?!</h3>
<p>This feature was contributed to Puma by Gitlab. Turn it on by adding <code>wait_for_less_busy_worker</code> to your Puma config.</p>
<p>When a request comes in to a Puma cluster, the operating system randomly selects a listening, free Puma worker process to pick up the request. “Listening” and “free” being the key words - a Puma process will only listen to the socket (and pick up more requests) if it has nothing else to do. However, when running Puma with multiple threads, Puma will also listen on the socket when all of its busy threads are waiting on I/O or have otherwise released <a href="https://www.speedshop.co/2020/09/17/2020/05/11/the-ruby-gvl-and-scaling.html">the Global VM Lock</a>.</p>
<p>When Gitlab investigated switching from Unicorn to Puma, they encountered an issue with this behavior. Under high load with moderate thread settings (a max pool size of 5 in their case), average request latency increased. Why?</p>
<p>Remember, I said that the operating system <em>randomly</em> assigns a request to a <em>listening</em> worker process. So, it will never send a request to a worker process that’s busy doing other things, but what about a worker process that’s got 4 threads that are processing other requests, but all 4 of those threads happen to be waiting on I/O right now?</p>
<p>Imagine a Puma cluster with 3 workers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Worker 1: 0/5 threads busy.</li>
<li>Worker 2: 1/5 threads busy.</li>
<li>Worker 3: 4/5 threads busy.</li>
</ul>
<p>If Worker 3’s 4 active threads happen to all have released the GVL, allowing that worker to listen to the socket, and a new request comes in - which worker process should we assign the request to, ideally? Worker 1, right? Unfortunately, most operating systems will assign the request to Worker 3 33% of the time.</p>
<p>So, what do we do? We want the operating system to prefer less-loaded workers. It would be really cool if we could sort the list of workers listening on the socket so that the operating system would give requests to the least-loaded worker. Well, we can’t really do that easily, but we can do something else.</p>
<p><code>wait_for_less_busy_worker</code> causes a worker to <em>wait</em> to re-listen on the socket if it’s thread pool isn’t completely empty. This means that in high-load scenarios, the operating system will assign requests to less-loaded workers.</p>
<p><strong>This is basically sleep-sorting our workers</strong>. We’re kind of doing doing this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>[].tap { |a| workers.map { |e| Thread.new{ sleep worker_busyness.to_f/1000; a &lt;&lt; e} }.each{|t| t.join} }
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>… and hiding “more loaded” workers from the operating system by letting less-loaded workers listen first!</p>
<p>Originally the proposal was for a more complicated sort - processes slept longer if they had more busy threads - but that was removed when it was found that a simpler on/off sleep was just as effective.</p>
<p>The net effect is that in high-load scenarios, request latency decreases. This is because workers with more busy threads are slower than workers with no busy threads. We’re assuring that requests get assigned to the faster workers. Prior to this patch, Gitlab saw an increase in latency using Puma compared to Unicorn - after this patch, latency was the same (they also were able to reduce their fleet size by almost 30% thanks to Puma’s memory-saving multithreaded design).</p>
<p>There may be even more efficient ways for us to implement this behavior in the future. There’s some magic you can do with <code>libev</code>, I’m pretty sure, or we can just implement a different sleep/wait strategy.</p>
<h3 id="fork_worker">fork_worker</h3>
<p>Adding <code>fork_worker</code> to your puma.rb config file (or <code>--fork-worker</code> from the CLI) turns on this feature. This mode causes Puma to fork additional workers from worker 0, instead of directly from the master process:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>10000   \_ puma 5.0.0 (tcp://0.0.0.0:9292) [puma]
10001       \_ puma: cluster worker 0: 10000 [puma]
10002           \_ puma: cluster worker 1: 10000 [puma]
10003           \_ puma: cluster worker 2: 10000 [puma]
10004           \_ puma: cluster worker 3: 10000 [puma]
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Similar to the <code>preload_app!</code> option, the <code>fork_worker</code> option allows your application to be initialized only once for copy-on-write memory savings, and it has two additional advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Compatible with phased restart.</strong> Because the master process itself doesn’t preload the application, this mode works with phased restart (<code>SIGUSR1</code> or <code>pumactl phased-restart</code>), unlike <code>preload_app!</code>. When worker 0 reloads as part of a phased restart, it initializes a new copy of your application first, then the other workers reload by forking from this new worker already containing the new preloaded application.</li>
</ol>
<p>This allows a phased restart to complete as quickly as a hot restart (<code>SIGUSR2</code> or <code>pumactl restart</code>), while still minimizing downtime by staggering the restart across cluster workers.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>‘Refork’ for additional copy-on-write improvements in running applications.</strong> Fork-worker mode introduces a new <code>refork</code> command that re-loads all nonzero workers by re-forking them from worker 0.</li>
</ol>
<p>This command can potentially improve memory utilization in large or complex applications that don’t fully pre-initialize on startup, because the re-forked workers can share copy-on-write memory with a worker that has been running for a while and serving requests.</p>
<p>You can trigger a refork by sending the cluster the <code>SIGURG</code> signal or running the <code>pumactl refork</code> command at any time. A refork will also automatically trigger once, after a certain number of requests have been processed by worker 0 (default 1000). To configure the number of requests before the auto-refork, pass a positive integer argument to <code>fork_worker</code> (e.g., <code>fork_worker 1000</code>), or <code>0</code> to disable.</p>
<h3 id="nakayoshi_fork">nakayoshi_fork</h3>
<p>Add <code>nakayoshi_fork</code> to your puma.rb config to try this option.</p>
<p>Nakayoshi means “friendly”, so this is a “friendly fork”. The concept was <a href="https://github.com/ko1/nakayoshi_fork">originally implemented by MRI supercontributor Koichi Sasada</a> in a gem, but we wanted to see if we could bring a simpler version into Puma.</p>
<p>Basically, we just do the following before forking a worker:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>4</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>{</span> <span>GC</span><span>.</span><span>start</span> <span>}</span>
<span>GC</span><span>.</span><span>compact</span> <span># if available</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The concept here is that we’re trying to get as clean of a Ruby heap as possible before forking to maximize <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write">copy-on-write</a> benefits. That should, in turn, lead to reduced memory usage.</p>
<h2 id="other-new-features">Other New Features</h2>
<p>A few more things in the grab-bag:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can now compile Puma on machines where OpenSSL is not installed.</li>
<li>There is now a <code>thread-backtraces</code> command in pumactl to print all active threads backtraces. This has been available via SIGINFO on Darwin, but now it works on Linux via this new command.</li>
<li><code>Puma.stats</code> now has a <code>requests_count</code> counter.</li>
<li><code>lowlevel_error_handler</code> got some enhancements - we also pass the status code to it now.</li>
<li>Phased restarts and worker timeouts should be faster.</li>
<li><code>Puma.stats_hash</code> provides Puma statistics as a hash, rather than as JSON.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="loads-of-bugfixes">Loads of Bugfixes</h2>
<p>The number of bugfixes in this release is pretty huge. Here’s the most important ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shutdowns should be more reliable.</li>
<li>Issues surrounding socket closing on shutdown have been resolved.</li>
<li>Fixed some concurrency …</li></ul></article></div></div></div>
