<div><p>It seems like so long ago we were all sitting around watching our friends scroll through this new app called Instagram on their iPhone 4’s. Iâ€™m sure your conversations went something like this:<br><em>â€œItâ€™s like Facebook but just for picturesâ€¦â€�<br>â€œThat wonâ€™t last long, thatâ€™s boring.â€�<br></em>Well, this year Instagram turns 10! The app quickly caught the eye of the marketing world and has only expanded from there. With the introduction of<a href="https://www.digitalmediateam.co.uk/boost-posts-social-media-dmt-blog/"> boost posts</a>, ads and in-depth analytics it’s never been easier to know your audience and cater what they want. </p><p>Weâ€™re breaking down what Instagram does best: getting those likes. Let’s start giving you the rundown on the top ten most-loved Instagram photos of all time.</p></div>



<hr>







<h2>Ten:</h2>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>This isnâ€™t the only appearance Kylie Jenner will make on our Instagram list. Currently with 168 million followers, this isn’t surprising.  The make up mogul knows her angles and VSCO filters – and I suppose the professional photographers help too. </p>



<hr>







<h2>Nine:</h2>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/B0ZBRxUDX9y/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="12"></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>After the rough year Selena had she came back thriving. She was living her best life on a boat in Italy and her followers rushed to support it in the form of 14 million likes. </p>



<hr>







<h2>Eight:</h2>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/BtxEL1EgbYa/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="12"></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Sheâ€™s back again and better than ever. The photos show a very happy Selena on the beach hanging around with her friends and celebrating her friend getting married. </p>



<hr>







<h2>Seven:</h2>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/B1V5m7WFfUy/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="12"></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>There is not a single person alive who dislikes Dwayne â€˜The Rockâ€™ Johnson and the amount of likes he got on this post proves that. He tied the knot to his now-wife Lauren in his homeland of Hawaii. </p>



<hr>







<h2>Six:</h2>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/B72NUtWA0gS/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="12"></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The world was left heartbroken by the death of Kobe Bryant. In an emotional post, LeBron James pours his heart out as he talks about his friend and team mate.  </p>



<hr>







<h2>Five:</h2>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bwjpxgph9DE/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="12"></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>A newcomer has stormed the list! This post seemed to appear on everyone’s stories almost simultaneously. Not only is this a perfect example of what you can do with good marketing and a smart social media team, but proof that people do care about the planet and are trying to make change! The campaign is still active so go ahead and like it and plant one more tree. </p>



<hr>







<h2>Four:</h2>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3o8vWDhlOh/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="12"></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Jennifer Anniston posted this picture with her *ahem* friendsâ€¦ and the internet went wild. Aniston broke the Guinness World Record for being the fastest person to reach one million likes on a picture. It took her just five hours and 16 minutes to set the entire Instagram world into a <em>Friends</em> frenzy. </p>



<hr>







<h2>Three:</h2>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/Be3rTNplCHf/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="12"></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>To someone who isnâ€™t up to date on the situation, it may look like any other regular baby photo. But Kylie kept us waiting to announce this one, 341 days to be exact. After hiding her pregnancy from the public, this was her way of finally letting the world know that Stormi was here. </p>



<hr>







<h2>Two:</h2>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bi-hISIghYe/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="12"></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>This was the first and the last post on the late rappers Instagram page. Eerily, before his death, a snippet of his upcoming video was released where he attended his own funeral. </p>



<hr>







<h2>One:</h2>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/BsOGulcndj-/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="12"></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Started from the bottom now weâ€™re here. The number one most liked photo of all time. An egg.<br></p>



<p>This picture of an egg cracked Kylie Jennerâ€™s Instagram record by a long shot, with over 50 million likes at the time of writing. The account was speculated to be lots of things but finally it was revealed that it would be explained during the Super Bowl.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>It was an effort to make people speak out about their mental health in collaboration with the streaming service, Hulu. The cheeky egg even got a response from Kylie herself. <br></p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/BsmPezCnZ4I/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="12"></blockquote>

      <span>May 28, 2014</span>
    </p>
    
<p>This week, spreadsheets hit the news again, when data for a book written by economist Pikkety turned out to contain&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/05/23/financial_times_on_piketty_his_data_is_wrong.html">spreadsheet errors</a>. On this, Daniele Lemire wrote a blog post warning people&nbsp;<a href="http://lemire.me/blog/archives/2014/05/23/you-shouldnt-use-a-spreadsheet-for-important-work-i-mean-it/">not to use spreadsheets for serious work</a>. This is useless advice, let me explain why.</p>
<p><strong>1) Only a fool blames their&nbsp;tool</strong></p>
<p>Heathcare.gov is built in Java. Did people go around the interwebs shouting&nbsp;we all should stop using Java? Of course not! Because it is easy to see that the problems stemmed from other areas: process, time pressure, lack of testing and other (human) factors probably. See how silly it is to blame a tool? The same goes for spreadsheets. Yes, they are not so easy to test,&nbsp;but they have many benefits, like ‘liveness’ (immediate feedback), having data, metadata and calculations in one view, ease of deployment. In that sense, they have&nbsp;benefits over other programming environments.</p>
<p><strong>2) No, we do not know better!&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I have been working on spreadsheets as a researcher for about 5 years now, and during that time I spoke with a lot of spreadsheet users. Of course, I asked them why they would run a bank/insurance company/airline on spreadsheets. You know what many of them say?</p>
<p><em>“We asked IT to build this, they said it would take 6 months and half a million euros. And most likely it will be more expensive and not what we want.”</em></p>
<p>The reality is that it is just not feasible to build software for all business processes. We don’t have the manpower, and frankly, in many cases also not the domain skill needed. So what we need to do isn’t ridicule spreadsheet users.&nbsp;They have been disappointed by us many times. I already mentioned healthcare.gov and there are so many other IT screw-ups that it is almost&nbsp;arrogant to claim superiority over the spreadsheet users.</p>
<p><strong>3) Like democracy, spreadsheets are the worst, except for all others</strong></p>
<p>Then, in addition to our riducule, we try to push tools to them, “real” programming languages, that nor fit their needs nor their skills. They will never learn Java or C#. Python maybe, that seems to be easy to use for end-users, but certainly not for all of them. End-users are not programmers, they don’t want to be and they should not need to be.</p>
<p>Instead of shaming spreadsheet users, let’s focus on inventing better spreadsheet-killers tools (Tableau is my personal favorite at the moment). Or, and this is my line of research, help spreadsheet users to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.felienne.com/archives/2957">test</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://figshare.com/articles/Detecting_and_refactoring_code_smells_in_spreadsheet_formulas/980655">measure</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.felienne.com/archives/2964">refactor</a>. No one, really, no one, is helped with your judgement without thinking about alternatives.</p>

Chat bots are nothing new but unless they meet a high-enough quality bar, they tend to be a step backwards rather than forward. We believe huge language models such as <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/">OpenAI’s GPT-3</a> will form a foundation for a truly conversational human-computer interface. It is, however, a foundation rather than a solution in and of itself.</p><p>In this new paradigm, the big challenge becomes to ensure the chat bot strictly sticks to the topic it was designed for and provides accurate information - without depriving it of its creativity.</p><p>I will discuss this briefly in the context of what we refer to as <strong>knowledge-base chat bots</strong>. They are built to answer general questions and hold a conversation about a product, service or a topic delineated by a predetermined unstructured knowledge base.</p><p><img src="https://blog.quickchat.ai/images/zeroth_faster.gif" alt="Start a conversation - image" title="Start a conversation"></p><p>Our chat bot implementation approved by the OpenAI team (try it out live at <a href="https://itemsy.com/">itemsy.com</a>) is an expert on Itemsy - a software product for managing the content you read online. It relies on GPT-3 for its conversational capabilities.</p><p>Thanks to our <a href="https://quickchat.ai/">Quickchat</a> engine (on top of GPT-3), it makes full and accurate use of the Itemsy knowledge base it was provided with, focuses on the topic at hand and cannot be maneuvered away from it:</p><p><img src="https://blog.quickchat.ai/images/first_faster.gif" alt="Avoid off-topic conversations - image" title="Avoid off-topic conversations"></p><p>Ultimately, it’s all about <em>conversation</em>. It requires context, needs to be unscripted, adaptive and creative. You’re still talking to a machine but this time language feels more like natural language. 🙃</p><p><img src="https://blog.quickchat.ai/images/second_faster.gif" alt="Creative conversation guided by the user - image" title="Creative conversation guided by the user"></p><p>We’re ready to work with you and launch conversational chat bots for a wide range of use cases.

The problem is that the ease of accessing and interacting with a dataset is reversed correlated with the dataset’s size and complexity. Finding edge cases and interesting interactions within a large scale dataset is like finding a needle in a haystack. Therefore, making a great dataset such as nuScenes accessible through SiaSearch, makes the dataset even more powerful, as it becomes fully accessible and the process of selecting the relevant driving sequences is now trivial.</p><p><strong>The Importance of Research</strong></p><p>The research community plays a critical role in the autonomous vehicle (AV) development ecosystem. Some of the most important advancements in AV development became a reality thanks to curious researchers from labs around the globe. Both SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), as well as object detection, can be mentioned as ideal examples for significant progress that was done in research environments. They laid the groundwork for fundamental problems any AV engineer deals with during their daily jobs in the industry.</p><p>Today, the development of AV is very data-driven. Without driving datasets it would be impossible to train and validate perception, prediction, or motion planning models. However, equipping a test vehicle with a typical sensor setup (cameras, lidars, radars, GPS, imu) can cost up to a few hundred thousands of dollars. Therefore, large-scale publicly available datasets (free of charge for non-commercial activities) have played a significant part and will continue to do so, with regards to pushing forward the development of AV.</p><p>Lots of articles were written on the importance of public datasets and the motivation of the different OEMs, Tier 1 suppliers, and full-stack startups to release them to the research community.<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/05/29/how-open-source-data-can-drive-automotive-innovation/#117f9d5dfd40">[1]</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://news.mit.edu/2020/mit-toyota-release-visual-open-data-accelerate-autonomous-driving-research-0618">[2]</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/21/waymo-releases-a-self-driving-open-data-set-for-free-use-by-the-research-community/">[3]</a>&nbsp;These publications all share similar motivations such as encouraging researchers to develop new insights, discuss novel perspectives as well as to discover solutions to existing and shared problems. Therefore, it is clear that the industry sees the research community as an integral part of the autonomous vehicles ecosystem and as a facilitator for future and advanced developments.</p><p><strong>How SiaSearch is Used to Curate Training Datasets</strong></p><p>For example, as an ML engineer working on motion planning, you know you have a problem with your model when it comes to complex driving scenarios such as unprotected left turns with oncoming traffic and pedestrians next to the ego vehicle. You want to curate a training dataset to improve your model — how would you find the relevant data?!<br>Currently, this process is time-consuming and requires a manual review of large amounts of data to select scenes that fit the requirements.</p><p>With SiaSearch this process can be heavily accelerated. The ML engineer can curate a training dataset in just a few minutes! (even seconds, but we don’t like to brag). Intuitively querying the entire data lake and finding exactly what he needs before exporting the data to her development environment.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1601557776763_108903"><div><p>Explore nuScenes through SiaSearch —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.siasearch.io/open-data"><strong><em>register here</em></strong></a></p><p>If you want to learn more about SiaSearch and how it could help you to better interact with your raw sensor data, please feel free to visit our website at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.siasearch.io/">www.siasearch.io</a>, reach out to us via&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi@siasearch.io">hi@siasearch.io</a>&nbsp;and make sure to follow us on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/siasearch">LinkedIn</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/searchsia">Twitter</a>.</p><p>nuScenes is available for commercial use under our commercial license agreement.

  <p><label>Posted on <strong>28 September 2020</strong></label></p>
<p>Shadertoy is a wonderful tool which lets users create and share a type of program called a fragment shader online. The true magic of shadertoy is its community of very talented graphics programmers who build incredible works of art despite having access to only a sliver of the traditional graphics pipeline.  </p>
<p>Some of these shaders are very computationally intensive and even in a small window, they crawl along well below their intended 60 frames per second on my old laptop. Inspired by a technique in the VR community called Foveated Rendering, I decided to try to optimize these shaders by only rendering a fully detailed image within a small focal region. As you move away from the focal point the image quality decreases.   </p>
<p>This rendering scheme is motivated by biology. It turns out your eye notices more detail in the center of your vision than in the periphery. Some VR graphics programmers realized they could take advantage of this phenomenon to increase the effective resolution of images by increasing image quality towards the center of your vision. An in depth discussion of foveated rendering can be found in the “previous work section” of this <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/deepfovea-using-deep-learning-for-foveated-reconstruction-in-ar-vr">paper</a>.  </p>
<p>I did not have the time, equipment or the background necessary to implement a full foveated rendering system but it was fun to fool around with the concept.  </p>
<p>Before diving into the technical details let’s look at a simple shadertoy fragment shader.   </p>
<p><code>
void mainImage(out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord)<br>
{
</code></p><p><code>
    // Normalized pixel coordinates (from 0 to 1)<br>
    vec2 uv = fragCoord/iResolution.xy;
<div><pre><span></span><span>//</span> <span>Output</span> <span>the</span> <span>pixel</span> <span>coordinates</span> <span>as</span> <span>a</span> <span>color</span> <span>to</span> <span>screen</span>
<span>//</span> <span>fragColor</span> <span>is</span> <span>a</span> <span>4</span> <span>vector</span> <span>of</span> <span>the</span> <span>form</span>
<span>//</span> <span>(</span><span>red</span><span>,</span> <span>green</span><span>,</span> <span>blue</span><span>,</span> <span>transparency</span><span>)</span>
<span>fragColor</span> <span>=</span> <span>vec4</span><span>(</span><span>uv</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>
</pre></div>


</code></p><p><code>
}<br>
</code></p>
<p>This program runs once for each pixel on the screen. Each time it runs, we receive the input variable <code>fragCoord</code>. <code>fragCoord</code> is a 2d vector which contains the x and y coordinates of the pixel being drawn. We normalize those coordinates by dividing by <code>iResolution</code>, another 2d vector, which contains the width and height of the image. Finally we output a color to the screen, whose red and green channels are proportional to the x and y position of the pixel being drawn. The output of this shader looks like this:<br>
</p><p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/focused-render/simple-shader-out.png" width="50%"> 
</p>
<p>Side note, why do these shader programs require their own language? Shaders are special because they run on the graphics card instead of the cpu. They are highly parallel. A helpful mental model might be imagining that each pixel is colored simultaneously. Therefore a lot of things that we take for granted in normal program languages such as liberally accessing memory and branching become much more difficult.  </p>
<p>In shadertoy shaders the bottleneck is always in the pixel rendering step. So to speed them up we want to only render a subset of the all the pixels on the screen. It seems like selectively rendering pixels should be as simple as adding a branch to the per pixel shader code that looks like:  </p>
<p><code>
void mainImage(out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord) <br>
{<br>
</code></p><p><code>
    if (fragCoord is in the subset of pixels to render) {
      <p>
      ... do computationally intensive work 
      </p> 
    } else {
      <p>
      // return a black pixel<br>
      return vec4(0, 0, 0, 1); 
      </p> 
    } 
</code></p><p><code> 
}
</code></p>
<p>Unfortunately we cannot just use an if statement inside of the shader to save us from rendering all the pixels. Unlike normal programming languages, fragment shaders always execute both parts of each branch due to gpu limitations. So while our above code will still have to spend the sample amount of time evaluating compuationally intensive work.  </p>
<p>Luckily, it turns out that graphics drivers can selectively mark which pixels not to shade by writing their location to a special buffer called the stencil buffer. We can use this stencil buffer to only shade the subset of pixels we are interested in.</p>
<p>Once I could efficiently render a subset of the pixels, I needed to come up with a pre-generated sampling pattern. Most foveated rendering techniques seem to use a grid, but I decided to try a non uniform approach. Searching for some kind of optimal sampling pattern seemed like an interesting problem and if I was going to devote more time to this I'd explore options like <a href="https://blog.demofox.org/2018/01/30/what-the-heck-is-blue-noise/">blue noise</a>. However in the interest of time, I just decided fill in a small circle in the center and then use samples drawn from one low variance and one high variance gaussians centered at the middle of the screen to place the rest of the pixels. The final sampling pattern ended up looking like this:
</p><p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/focused-render/final-sample-pattern.png" width="50%"> 
</p>
<p>Next, I needed a way to fill in all the missing pixels in the final image. The approach I took was pretty simple. I started by mapping each pixel in the final screen to its nearest neighbor. Since my sampling pattern was predetermined, I could create this map beforehand and pass it into the shader as a texture. Here's what this mapping looks like:<br>
</p><p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/focused-render/nearest-mapping.png" width="50%"> 
</p>
<p>And here’s a gif of the mapping applied to a <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/3lsSzf">shadertoy</a> created by the extremely talented <a href="https://www.iquilezles.org/">Inigo Quilez</a>:<br>
</p><p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/focused-render/1-neighbor.gif"> 
</p>
<p>The above screen is 420x236 pixels and only 1/10th of those pixels are actually rendered. The focal point is directly in the center of the screen. Here's what the full resolution version looks like:</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/focused-render/original.gif"> 
</p>

<p>And here's what it looks like with only our sampling pixels:
</p><p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/focused-render/sample-pixels.gif"> 
</p>
<p>One little improvement I tried was to make 4 different maps. The kth map mapped each pixel in the final image to its kth nearest sampled neighbor. I weighted each of neighbors by the inverse of their distance to the pixel in question. I actually even tried using some gradient descent based optimization to fine tune the weights but ended up seeing little improvement. It also seemed that increasing the number of maps beyond 4 did not improve things much either. Here's what the example from above looks like with weighted interpolation between the four closest neighbors of each pixel (we are still rendering only 1/10th of the total pixels):
</p><p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/focused-render/4-neighbors.gif"> 
</p>
<p>Finally, here's the shader with 1/5th of the total pixels rendered (as opposed to 1/10th shown above):
</p><p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/focused-render/1of5pixels.gif"> 
</p>
<p>Okay that's all cool but does this technique actually increase performance? I did not do a rigerous benchmark, but <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/3l23Rh">this shader</a> goes from around 20-25 fps on my plugged in laptop to 60 fps when reduced to 1/5th of the total pixels. <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Ms2SD1">Another shader</a> went from around 15 fps to 60 fps.  </p>
<p>One last side note is that this method can be used with any 3d scene and is not exclusive to shader toys. I just chose to use them because they are always bottlenecked by the pixel rendering step and they are really pretty!</p>
<p>Further questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we achive better temporal stability? (the <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/deepfovea-using-deep-learning-for-foveated-reconstruction-in-ar-vr">paper</a> I mentioned earlier talks about this)</li>
<li>Can we dynamically change the sampling pattern to give us better results? For example what if we sampled along edges or areas where large amounts of motion is occuring? Of course to do this we would need to compute our nearest neighbor mappings on the fly (there are actually <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XtlGDS">some</a> <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ldl3W8">shadertoys</a> which already demonstrate capability).</li>
<li>How could this scheme improve if we had access to the internals of the 3d scene? For example, could we adjust our sampling pattern based on depth information?  </li>
<li>How does this actually look in VR?  </li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Scroll scroll scroll. Going through forms and having to open a dropdown to select your country, or even worse, gender can be time consuming. I’ve been wondering how time consuming exactly and whether some select types are better. So I thought; let’s run an experiment!</p>



<p>I quickly hacked together <a href="https://github.com/bvanderdrift/select-experiment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some code</a> and let over 500 unique users fill in a form asking for their age and country. The app asks users to select their country from 3 to 55 options (Distributed according to the Fibonacci sequence, because I like Fibonacci 🤓 ). The app shows either of the following four types of select interactions:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="701" height="596" src="https://its.beer/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Group-1-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://its.beer/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Group-1-1.png 701w, https://its.beer/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Group-1-1-300x255.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 701px) 100vw, 701px"></figure></div>



<p>The results were as follows (click on the image to open the actual chart):</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://select-experiment.vercel.app/results/line" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" width="898" height="457" src="https://its.beer/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-from-2020-09-27-13-49-05.png" alt="" srcset="https://its.beer/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-from-2020-09-27-13-49-05.png 898w, https://its.beer/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-from-2020-09-27-13-49-05-300x153.png 300w, https://its.beer/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-from-2020-09-27-13-49-05-768x391.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 898px) 100vw, 898px"></a></figure></div>



<h2>Why does the drop-down spike at 21 options?</h2>



<p>Since all the respondents were from the States (I had to guarantee one option somehow) and the “U” is low in the alphabet, my <strong>assumption</strong> is that somewhere above 13 options is when the option started to fall off the screen.</p>



<h2>Why is autocomplete so high?</h2>



<p>That’s also what baffled me, I expected this to be the fastest way to do a select when there are many options. There are two <strong>hypotheses:</strong></p>



<ol><li>Most people started looking for “<strong>The</strong> United States” which would fail because the country is marked as “United States”. </li><li>The interaction of the autocomplete is difficult. After user-testing the experiment with friends some said they didn’t know whether they had to click the option, press enter or do another interaction.</li></ol>



<p>In a scatterplot you can clearly identify that a good amount of people who had to use the autocomplete interaction struggled to select their answer.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://select-experiment.vercel.app/results/scatter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" width="901" height="453" src="https://its.beer/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://its.beer/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image.png 901w, https://its.beer/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-300x151.png 300w, https://its.beer/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-768x386.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 901px) 100vw, 901px"></a></figure></div>



<p>The “Autocomplete” outliers were at least three times as frequent as the others.</p>



<ul><li>Autocomplete: 10 outliers (shown in chart)</li><li>Dropdown: 3 outliers (not shown)</li><li>Textual card: 3 outliers (not shown)</li><li>Visual Card: 2 outliers (not shown)</li></ul>



<p>Since the autocomplete outliers were overrepresented, I <strong>assumed</strong> that the autocomplete were caused by something else than maleficent intent and decided not to remove the autocomplete outliers in the data-cleaning process (explained further down).</p>



<p>💡 Idea: re-run the experiment with “The” in front and a nudge to let users know they have to click the option. But, since I used Mechanical Turk to source the responses and this is just a fun experiment, it wasn’t worth the 💰!</p>



<h2>What are some biases?</h2>



<p>A quick experiment doesn’t come without biases. First off, the ages of 20-49 are over-represented;</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://select-experiment.vercel.app/results/age-distribution" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" width="886" height="449" src="https://its.beer/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-from-2020-09-27-13-49-38.png" alt="" srcset="https://its.beer/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-from-2020-09-27-13-49-38.png 886w, https://its.beer/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-from-2020-09-27-13-49-38-300x152.png 300w, https://its.beer/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-from-2020-09-27-13-49-38-768x389.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 886px) 100vw, 886px"></a></figure></div>



<p>💭 Thought: the data of this experiment is representative for you if your demographic matches these responses. If your user’s age distribution is very different you might want to consider re-running the experiment yourself for your demographic! Feel free to use the code <a href="https://github.com/bvanderdrift/select-experiment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>!</p>



<p>Also, over 80% of respondents is from the US 🇺🇸, with the rest being Dutch 🇳🇱 (I trialed it first with friends!).</p>

<p>💭 Thought: since users had to select their country, the positioning of “United States” and “Netherlands” in a list might have introduced a bias in the data.</p>



<h2>Data Cleaning</h2>



<p>Of course there were also some jokers 🤡! I removed any response where:</p>



<ul><li>The age was negative. There were no positive age-outliers.</li><li>The country was neither US or Dutch (in MTurk only US participants could answer, thus I feel safe removing other countries).</li><li>Anyone whose time-to-completion was very extreme (e.g., some people took 1.5 minutes to select their country, wow!). As explained earlier I did leave the autocomplete outliers in.</li></ul>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>With an average of 18 data-points for each combination there is too little data to make strong recommendations, but I’m going to try anyway:</p>



<ul><li>8 or less options? Avoid drop-downs &amp; auto-completes, just use a single-interaction method; the textual or visual cards!</li><li>Have over 55 options? Go for the auto-complete and save your users a bunch of headache 😊. Make sure to clearly communicate the required select interaction though, such as ‘Enter’ or a click!</li></ul>

Let’s talk about a vulnerability that’s exposing 2018-2020 Macs while most are declining to act nor report about the matter.
Oh, and did I mention it’s unpatchable?</strong></p><p><strong>Buckle up buckaroo, we’re in for a wild ride.</strong></p><p>Skip to <a href="#security-issues">#security-issues</a> for the technical mumbo-jumbo.</p><h2 id="preface">Preface</h2><h3 id="attribution">Attribution</h3><p>The following post is an industry analysis of the code and research performed by <a href="https://twitter.com/axi0mx/">twitter.com/axi0mx</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/h0m3us3r/">twitter.com/h0m3us3r</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/aunali1/">twitter.com/aunali1</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mcmrarm/">twitter.com/mcmrarm</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/su_rickmark/">twitter.com/su_rickmark</a> who poured endless hours of work into this, allowing companies and users to understand their risks concerning this issue.</p><h3 id="intel-vs-silicon">Intel vs Silicon</h3><p>This blog post only applies to macOS systems with an Intel processor and the embedded T2 security chip.
Apple silicon systems will run completely on a set of Apple-designed ARM processors and mighth have a different topology, e.g. based on the A12.
Since the A12 chip seems to have fixed this issue (to be confirmed), it’s highly likely the new Apple Silicon machines will not be vulnerable.
And while the new upcoming Intel Macs at the end of year will probably receive a new hardware revision of the T2 chip (e.g. based on the A12), we are still stuck with this vulnerability on Macs between 2018 and 2020.</p><h3 id="so-about-this-t2-thing">So about this T2 thing</h3><p>In case you are using a recent macOS device, you are probably using <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208862">the embedded T2 security chip</a> which runs <em>bridgeOS</em> and is actually based on watchOS. This is a custom ARM processor designed by Apple based on the A10 CPU found in the iPhone 7.
The T2 chip contains a <em>Secure Enclave Processor</em> (SEP), much like the A-series processor in your iPhone will contain a SEP.</p><p>While newer Macs and/or Apple Silicon (including the dev kit) will use a more recent A-series processor such as the one found in the recent iPhone (A12), current Macs still use the A10.</p><p>It performs a predefined set of tasks for macOS such as audio processing, handling I/O, functioning as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module">Hardware Security Module</a> for e.g. Apple KeyChain or 2FA, hardware accelerating media playback, whitelisting kernel extensions, cryptographic operations and <strong>ensuring the operating system you are booting is not tampered with</strong>.
The T2 chip runs its own firmware called <em>bridgeOS</em>, which can be updated when you install a new macOS version. (ever notice the screen flickering? that’s the display driver being interrupted and possibly updated.)</p><p><em>Edit</em>: I first mentioned the iPad Pro to be impacted by the T2 vulnerability, but while it could suffer from the same vulnerability, it does not contain a T2 chip.</p><h3 id="the-macos-boot-sequence">The macOS boot sequence</h3><p>So let’s focus on the boot image verification on macOS. What exactly happens when you press that power button?
<a href="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/bootprocess.png">There’s also a visual representation for any <em>conaisseurs</em></a>.
For the enthusiasts, I personally find <a href="https://michaellynn.github.io/2018/07/27/booting-secure/">Booting Secure by mikeymikey</a> a more in-depth description.</p><ol><li><p>The T2 chip is fully booted and stays on, even if your Mac device is shutdown.</p></li><li><p>The press of the power button or the opening of the lid triggers the System Management Controller (SMC) to boot.</p></li><li><p>The SMC performs a Power-On-Self-Test (POST) to detect any EFI or hardware issues such as bad RAM and possibly redirect to Recovery.</p></li><li><p>After those basic sanity checks, the T2 chip is triggered and I/O connectors are setup. (USB, NVMe, PCIe, …) It will use NVMe and PCIe to talk to NAND storage.</p></li><li><p>The applicable boot disk is selected and a disk encryption password is asked if enabled to mount <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_File_System">APFS</a> volumes possibly via FileVault2 disk encryption.</p></li><li><p><code>/System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi</code> is located on your System APFS volume and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208330">depending on your secure boot settings</a> is validated.</p></li><li><p><em>boot.efi</em> is ran which loads the Darwin kernel <em>(throwback to BSD)</em> (or Boot Camp if booting Microsoft Windows) &amp; IODevice drivers. If a kernel cache is found in <code>/System/Library/PrelinkedKernels/prelinkedkernel</code>, it will use that.</p></li><li><p>Any User Approved Kernel Extensions are initialized &amp; added to the kernel space -if- they are approved by the T2 chip.
<em>This will go away with System Extensions</em>.</p></li></ol><h3 id="macos-security-features">macOS security features</h3><p>So Apple has a couple of tricks up its sleeve to limit the attack surface of any potential security vulnerabilities. A small summary of related measures since macOS Big Sur on Intel processors:</p><ul><li><p><em>System Integrity Protection</em> (SIP): a read-only <code>/System</code> partition so the base install of macOS (including the kernel) cannot be tampered with.</p></li><li><p><em>System Extensions</em>: a move to away from Kernel Extensions, getting external code out of the Kernel framework-wise.</p></li><li><p><em>Secure Boot</em>: verifies the signature validity of the operating system on disk.</p></li><li><p><em>Filesystem seals</em>: every byte of data is compared to a hash in the filesystem metadata tree, recursively verifying integrity.</p></li></ul><h3 id="apple-marketing">Apple marketing</h3><p>As you probably all already know, Apple pushes forward privacy &amp; security as important weapons in todays world of technology.
They tout their devices as highly secure and vouch to handle your personal data using a privacy-centric approach.
While there have been mistakes made in the past (who can blame them?), Apple has been generally quick to fix any security issues that were disclosed to <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201220">their responsible disclosure program</a> or in public.</p><h2 id="security-issues">Security issues</h2><h3 id="jailbreaking">Jailbreaking</h3><h3 id="the-core-problem">The core problem</h3><p>The mini operating system on the T2 (<em>SepOS</em>) suffers from a security vulnerable also found in the iPhone 7 since it contains a processor based on the iOS A10. Exploitation of this type of processor for the sake of installing homebrew software is very actively discussed in the <a href="https://reddit.com/r/jailbreak/">/r/jailbreak</a> subreddit.</p><p>So using the <a href="https://checkm8.info/">checkm8 exploit</a> originally made for iPhones, the checkra1n exploit was developed to build a semi-tethered exploit for the T2 security chip, exploiting a flaw. This could be used to e.g. circumvent activation lock, allowing stolen iPhones or macOS devices to be reset and sold on the black market.</p><p>Normally the T2 chip will exit with a fatal error if it is in DFU mode and it detects a decryption call, but thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/windknown/presentations/blob/master/Attack_Secure_Boot_of_SEP.pdf">blackbird vulnerability</a> by team Pangu, we can completely circumvent that check in the SEP and do whatever we please.</p><p>Since sepOS/BootROM is <em>Read-Only Memory</em> for security reasons, interestingly, Apple cannot patch this core vulnerability without a new hardware revision.
This thankfully also means that this is not a persistent vulnerability, so it will require a hardware insert or other attached component such as a malicious USB-C cable.</p><h3 id="debugging">Debugging</h3><p>Every Apple iDevice (which includes the T2 and the Watch, via a port under the band) ships with a firmware recovery USB interface called Device Firmware Update (DFU), which is triggered when the device is not be able to boot or by pressing a particular set of buttons when turned on. It is always available because it is code run from SecureROM. This is the mode in which checkm8 runs.</p><p>Apple also leaves the ability to access various debug functionality which is disabled on production devices unless a special boot payload is used which runs in DFU. Since Apple is the only one who can sign code for DFU, they can demote any device they like, including the most recent A14 processors.
But since the checkm8 vulnerability runs so early in the boot process, we too can demote the T2 into DFU mode.
Without checkm8, we would not be able to run unsigned code in DFU and thus not be able enable debug interfaces. Once the debug interface is enabled Apple uses specialized cables with simian names (see Chimp, Kanzi, Gorilla).</p><h3 id="impact">Impact</h3><p>Once you have access on the T2, you have full <code>root</code> access and kernel execution privileges since the kernel is rewritten before execution.
Good news is that if you are using FileVault2 as disk encryption, they do not have access to your data on disk <em>immediately</em>.
They can however inject a keylogger in the T2 firmware since it manages keyboard access, storing your password for retrieval or transmitting it in the case of a malicious hardware attachment.</p><p>The functionality of locking an Apple device remotely (e.g. via MDM or FindMy) can be bypassed (<em>Activation Lock</em>).</p><p>A firmware password does not mitigate this issue since it requires keyboard access, and thus needs the T2 chip to run first.</p><p>Any kernel extension could be whitelisted since the T2 chip decides which one to load during boot.</p><p>If the attack is able to alter your hardware (or sneak in a malicious USB-C cable), it would be possible to achieve a semi-tethered exploit.</p><p>While this may not sound as frightening, be aware that this is a perfectly possible attack scenario for state actors.
I have sources that say more news is on the way in the upcoming weeks. I quote: <em>be afraid, be very afraid</em>.</p><h2 id="exploitation">Exploitation</h2><pre><code># install devtools

Since I did not receive a response for weeks, I did the same to numerous news websites that cover Apple, but no response there as well.
In hope of raising more awareness (and an official response from Apple), I am hereby disclosing almost all of the details.
You could argue I’m not following responsible disclosure, but since this issue has been known since 2019, I think …</p></div></div></div>

    <p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/chaos1.jpg" alt="Chaos, an important theme in hermetism" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>We live in a world that is gradually and incessantly attracted by
over-rationality and order. In this article we’ll burst the enchanted
bubble and embrace corruption and chaos — We’re going to discuss the
topic of image glitch art.</p>

<h2 id="w̸h̸a̷t̴̶s̴-̶a̴-̷g̷l̸i̷t̴c̵h̵">w̸h̸a̷t̴’̶s̴ ̶a̴ ̷g̷l̸i̷t̴c̵h̵</h2>

<p>Welcome to the land of creative destruction: image glitch art. Our story
starts with a simple idea: glitching a wallpaper to create a slideshow
of corrupted pictures.<br>
The unfortunate victim of our crime: The world (Right click <strong>&gt;</strong> View
image, while keeping the <strong>Control</strong> key pressed, to admire it in more
details while its still in its pristine form):</p>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/glitch_art/world_map.jpg" alt="World Map, nominal case" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>Before we begin, let’s attempt to define what we’re trying to do: What
is glitch art?<br>
Like any art movement, words can barely express the essence behind the
meaning, they are but fleeting and nebulous. Regardless, I’ll be an
infidel and valiantly express what I think glitch art is.</p>

<p>A glitch is a perturbation, a minor malfunction, a spurious signal. In
computers, glitches are predominantly accidental events that are
undesirable and could possibly corrupt data.<br>
Glitch art started as people developed a liking for such unusual events
and the effects glitches had on the media they were perturbing. Some started
to collect these glitches that happened naturally in the wild, and others
started to intentionally appropriate the effects by manually performing them.<br>
In the art scene, some started using image processing to “fake” true
glitching effects.</p>

<p>Glitches happen all the time and everywhere, information is never as
durable and reliable as we might like it to be, and living in a physical
world makes it even less so. You’ve probably encountered or heard of the
effect of putting a magnet next to anything electronic that hasn’t been
rugged to withstand such scenario.<br>
That’s why many techniques have been put in place to avoid glitches,
at all layers, from the hardware storage, to the software reading
and interpreting it. Be it error correcting codes (ECC) or error detection
algorithms, they are all enemies of glitch art and the chaos we like.</p>

<p>However, this niche aesthetic is more than a fun pass-time for computer
aficionado, there is a bigger picture. Similar to painters with
brushes on a canvas, we are offered a material, an object to work with
— a material made of bits and formatted in a specific way.<br>
Like any object, our medium has a form and meaning, it can move, it has
a size, it can be transferred, and interpreted — information theory
is the field interested in this.<br>
Like any object, our medium can be subject and react to deformations,
forces, and stressors. How it flows is what the field of rheology
is interested in (not to be confused with computational rheology, the
field of fluid simulation.) The medium fluidity can be studied to answer
questions such as: is it elastic, solid, viscous, or oily, how does it
respond, within the bound of information theory, to different types of
applied forces.</p>

<p>Here are some words you may encounter and that you definitely want
to know:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Misregistration: Whenever a physical medium misread data because of
damages caused by scratches, dirt, smudges, gamma rays, or any other
treasures the universe throws at us.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Datamoshing, Photomosh, Imagemosh: Abusing the format of a medium,
normally compression artefacts, to create glitches. For example, video
compression often use i-frames for fixed images and p-frame for the
movement/transition of pixels on that image. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datamoshing/">Removing i-frames is a
common glitching method</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Databending: An idea taken from circuit bending, bending the circuit
board of a toy to generate weird sounds. Databending is about bending
the medium into another unrelated one, reinterpreting it as something
it is not meant to be.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Let me add that glitch art is vast and fascinating, this article is but a
glimpse into this space. If you’re captivated as much as I am, please take
a look at <a href="http://gli.tc/h/0nline/">gli.tc</a> and <a href="https://beyondresolution.info/">Rosa Menkman’s Beyond
Resolution</a>. Images can be pleasantly
destroyed in a great number of ways to create masterpieces.</p>

<h2 id="i̷m̷a̷g̴e̴-̸g̸l̴i̴t̴c̵h̸-̴a̶r̵t̵">I̷m̷a̷g̴e̴ ̸G̸l̴i̴t̴c̵h̸ ̴A̶r̵t̵</h2>

<p>Before starting let’s give some advices:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Back up your precious files before corrupting them.</li>
  <li>Any glitching techniques can be combined and/or applied multiple times.</li>
  <li>Sometimes too little has no effect, and sometimes too much can destroy
the file.</li>
  <li>It’s all about trials and errors, especially errors that result in
glitches.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="̷h̷o̵w̶-̵t̸o̴-̶i̷n̶d̸u̷c̶e̵-̶a̸-̶g̸l̵i̷t̶c̸h̴">̷H̷o̵w̶ ̵T̸o̴ ̶I̷n̶d̸u̷c̶e̵ ̶A̸ ̶G̸l̵i̷t̶c̸h̴</h3>

<p>Now it’s time to think about how we can apply our mischievous little
stimuli, its size, the level or layer at which it’ll be applied, and
the methodological recipe we’ll concoct to poison our images.</p>

<p>Glitch artist Benjamin Berg classifies glitches into 3 categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Incorrect Editing: Editing a file using a software that
wasn’t made to edit such file. Like editing an image file as if it
was a text file.</li>
  <li>Reinterpretation aka Databending: Convert or read a file as if it was
another type of medium. Like listening to an image file as if it was
an audio file (aka sonification).</li>
  <li>Forced errors, Datamoshing, and Misregistration: A software or hardware
bug to force specific errors in the file. This can be about the
corruption of specific bytes in the file to induce glitches, or
something happening accidentally like a device turning off when saving
a file.</li>
</ul>

<p>So let’s get to work!</p>

<h3 id="m̷a̵s̵h̸i̶n̶g̷-̴t̶h̷e̷-̷d̶a̸t̵a̸-̸r̷a̸n̶d̶o̸m̴l̵y̷">M̷a̵s̵h̸i̶n̶g̷ ̴T̶h̷e̷ ̷D̶a̸t̵a̸ ̸R̷a̸n̶d̶o̸m̴l̵y̷</h3>

<p>The easiest, but roughest, way to glitch a file is to put on our monkey
suit and overwrite or add random bytes in our image. As you would have
guessed, this isn’t very efficient but half the time it does the trick
and forces errors.</p>

<p>This technique is better suited for stronger materials like images in
raw format — without metadata and headers. We’ll understand why in a bit.<br>
To convert the file to raw format, open it in GIMP, select <strong>Export As</strong>,
select the file by extension, and choose the raw type. For now, it doesn’t
matter if you pick pixel-ordered or planar, but we’ll come back to this
choice later because it’s an important one.</p>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/glitch_art/gimp_saveas_raw.jpg" alt="GIMP process to save image as raw" loading="lazy"></p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">file world_map.data
<span># world_map.data: Targa image data - Map (771-3) 771 x 259 x 1 - 1-bit alpha "\003\003\003\003\003\003\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001"</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You should also note the width and height of the image as it now doesn’t
contain this information anymore, and we’ll need those to reopen it in
GIMP. In our case it is <code>2000x1479</code>.</p>

<p>We now proceed to hand over the file to our least favorite
staff and let them have an anger tantrum at it. So what does
it look like, let’s take a look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6NMiuU0ys">the result our monkey
did</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/glitch_art/world_map_random_bytes.jpg" alt="World Map, monkey have been randomly mashing the
world" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>Not bad at all for something random, but we can do better.</p>

<p>Some medium are more malleable when squished properly and squished
in different ways. The image sheds a lot of information and only the
essence stays. That’s a form of databending.<br>
For example, increasing the compression of JPEG images can open the path
for glitches to happen more frequently. This is a key asset, especially
when trying to create errors related to the compression parameters within
the format of the file.</p>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/glitch_art/world_map_compressed.jpg" alt="World Map, compressed to extract its
essence" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>Keep this in your toolbox to use along with other techniques.</p>

<h3 id="g̵e̴t̵t̶i̸n̵g̷-̴i̸n̵t̷i̵m̷a̴t̸e̴-̸w̶i̵t̸h̶-̴t̵h̸e̸-̴f̷o̴r̶m̸a̴t̷">G̵e̴t̵t̶i̸n̵g̷ ̴I̸n̵t̷i̵m̷a̴t̸e̴ ̸W̶i̵t̸h̶ ̴T̵h̸e̸ ̴F̷o̴r̶m̸a̴t̷</h3>

<p>We want to corrupt in the most efficient way possible, to create
attractive chaos from the smallest change possible. To do that we have to
get intimate with the medium, to understand its deepest secrets, tickle
the image in the right places. This is what we previously referred to
as imagemoshing.</p>

<p>There’s a panoply of image formats, and they all are special in their
own ways. However, there’s still some commonality:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Header, Footer, and Metadata: If the format contains these extra
information, be it extraneous or essential, what they represent, and
how they affect the rest of the image.</li>
  <li>Compression: The format can either be compressed or not. When it is
compressed, there can be extra bits of information to help other software
uncompress the image data.</li>
  <li>How the data is laid out: Usually, the image color information is
decomposed into its components such as HSL, RGB, or others. These
components then need to be represented in the image data, either in
an interleaved or planar manner. Planar refers to writing components
independently in the data (<em>ex:</em> all R, then all G, then all B),
while interleaved refers to having them joined non-contiguously in an
alternate sequence (<em>ex:</em> RGB, then RGB, then RGB..).</li>
</ul>

<p>Manipulating these to our advantage can lead to wonderful glitches. For
example, in our previous raw image example — an image bare of header,
footer, and without compression — the pixels were interleaved which
gave rise to the effect we’ve seen, namely shifts and changes in some
colors. Having them in planar form would’ve led to different glitches
in separate color channels.</p>

<h3 id="r̵e̷i̷n̴t̶e̷r̶p̸r̴e̸t̸a̷t̶i̷o̵n̴-̵a̸s̵-̵r̸i̷c̵h̸-̸t̷e̵x̵t̴-̴a̴k̷a̸-̷w̶o̴r̵d̴p̴a̸d̵-̷e̵f̸f̴e̶c̶t̶">R̵e̷i̷n̴t̶e̷r̶p̸r̴e̸t̸a̷t̶i̷o̵n̴ ̵A̸s̵ ̵R̸i̷c̵h̸ ̸T̷e̵x̵t̴ ̴A̴K̷A̸ ̷W̶o̴r̵d̴P̴a̸d̵ ̷E̵f̸f̴e̶c̶t̶</h3>

<p>Let’s give this a try with the well-known WordPad effect, which is about
databending an image into rich text: opening the image in WordPad and
saving it.<br>
Keep in mind that this only works with raw images as it’s highly
destructive and otherwise could break fragile key info in the header
and footer. So let’s reuse our interleaved raw image of earlier but also
get a planar one.</p>

<p>This is our results for interleaved:</p>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/glitch_art/world_map_wordpad.interleaved.corrupt.jpg" alt="World Map, WordPad effect interleaved" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>And for planar:</p>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/glitch_art/world_map_wordpad.planar.corrupt.jpg" alt="World Map, WordPad effect planar" loading="lazy"></p>

as rich text, some bytes are inserted in some …</p></article></div></div>

<p><span>Computer and video game companies often dive into the deep end of innovation in a bid to capture the next big thing in gaming. The driving force is revenue, profits and capturing market share from competitors. Some innovations will be major financial successes, many others though will be mega financial disasters.</span></p>
<p><span>Like any other company in the video game industry, Nintendo have had their fair share of successes and failures. You remember the Nintendo Power Glove from 1989 don’t you? It was popularized in the film, The Wizard, as some sort of awesome extra gaming power controller to play your games and amaze your friends with. In reality it was a failure, it only lasted a year on the shelves, only had two compatible games to use it with and became the butt of jokes and social media memes because it turned out to be utterly useless and a crap gimmick at best.</span></p>
<p><span>The Gameboy on the other hand, also launched in 1989, was a worldwide success story for Ninetendo. This innovation<span>&nbsp; </span>brought portable gaming to millions of game players across the world. By 1995 the Game Boy phenomenon had also brought rise to the girl gamer market, Nintendo stated that 46% of Game Boy gamers were female. The Game Boy is one of Nintendo’s best innovations, becoming a video gaming industry cultural icon.</span></p>
<p><span>Like most years throughout the 1980’s and 1990’s, the video game market was powering ahead. Nintendo had become the biggest home video game and console company dominating world wide sales. 1994 / 1995 proved to be a very challenging year for Nintendo though. Its competitors Sega, released the 32 bit, 5th generation, Sega Saturn console and Sony released the 32 bit, 5th generation, Play Station console. In comparison Ninetendo had decided to discontinue sales of the NES, relying solely on the SNES as its main home console in the marketplace. It decided not to release any new normal consoles as its competitors had. The N64 would not hit shelves for at least another year. To coin a phrase it was a year of transition for Nintendo.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://paleotronic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vb1.jpg"><img src="http://paleotronic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vb1-422x1024.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="850" srcset="https://paleotronic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vb1-422x1024.jpg 422w, https://paleotronic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vb1-124x300.jpg 124w, https://paleotronic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vb1.jpg 705w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" data-old-src="https://paleotronic.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/lazy-images/images/1x1.trans.gif" data-lazy-src="http://paleotronic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vb1-422x1024.jpg" data-lazy-srcset="https://paleotronic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vb1-422x1024.jpg 422w, https://paleotronic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vb1-124x300.jpg 124w, https://paleotronic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vb1.jpg 705w"></a>What Nintendo decided to do in 1995 was take a gamble on one of the biggest buzz words in gaming during the 1990’s – “VR”. Virtual Reality was “in” and normal gaming was “out”. Movie titles including The Lawnmower Man (1992), Brainscan (1994), Arcade (1993), Disclosure (1994), Johnny Mnemonic (1995), Strange Days (1995) and<span>&nbsp; </span>Virtuosity (1995) all helped to foster the belief that VR was the future of gaming. Arcade venues and movie theatres were places where people could try out this new VR goggle technology. Nintendo had seen the new VR market was emerging which led them in 1995 to launch their own version of VR called the Virtual Boy.</span></p>
<p><span>Straight to the point – Nintendo’s Virtual Boy dubbed the “goggles on legs machine” was a spectacular failure. It lasted just 6 months after its initial release. Why did it fail ? It wasn’t from a lack of development, Nintendo had spent four years and millions of dollars advancing the project which had originally been code named “VR32” – presumably and obviously because The Virtual Boy was a 32-bit video game console. Such was the high expectations of VR gaming, Nintendo had built a dedicated manufacturing plant in China to manufacture and work on the Technology of The Virtual Boy.</span></p>
<p><span>Where the VR technology came from within the Nintendo Virtual Boy is traced back to an American company called Reflection Technology Incorporated (RTI). As early as 1985, RTI had developed a red LED eyepiece display technology called the Scanned Linear Array. It produced a “3D” stereoscopic head tracking prototype called the Private Eye, featuring a tank game. RTI had been demonstrating and pitching the technology to all the major toy and computer game companies but most of them declined to use it because of the single colour display and concerns about motion sickness for the wearer of the headset.</span></p>
<p><span>Gunpei Yokoi, the then General Manager of Nintendo’s Research and Development arm and the inventor of the highly successful Game &amp; Watch and Game Boy handheld consoles, embraced the new VR tech demonstrated by RTI. Where others had dismissed it, Gunpei Yokoi looked at it as a unique new technology that Nintendo’s competitors would find difficult to emulate.</span></p>

Was it because the tech was inferior as to why it failed? Well, yes. Even though consoles were advancing more rapidly than ever, gamers still loved the traditional console entertainment package – a console hooked up to a tv with a controller to play their favourite games. Nintendo’s Virtual Boy was completely different to the normal console. It marketed and advertised the Virtual Boy as the ‘first ever mobile console’ capable of displaying stereoscopic “3D” graphics. Very strange when you consider the unit was quite bulky and heavy to actually be called a mobile console. While it sounded like awesome new technology, breaking ground and breaking barriers in traditional gaming, it didn’t really offer anything different at all. The main change in game playing came about in how a gamer played their games and this proved to be one of the Virtual Boy’s many downfalls.</span></p>
<p><span>To use The Virtual Boy console you didn’t wear it like you would wear normal VR devices of the time period – no not on your head, instead you placed your head against the eyepiece of the Virtual Boy console. You had to crouch down to be able to see inside it<span>&nbsp; </span>The reason for this headless design came about from new concerns over children developing lazy eye symptoms and new laws, in particular, Japan’s new Product Liability Act of 1995. The head mounted google design was scrapped because of these and other safety concerns. The company also feared that wearers of a head mounted goggle based gaming machine, could fall down a flight of stairs in their homes, injuring themselves while playing the mobile battery packed portable VR machine. So with Nintendo’s legal team worrying about future liability costs, a heavy steel shielded table top design was implemented conformant to the recommendation of the Schepens Eye Research Institute.</span></p>
<p><span>When you looked into the Virtual Boy to play games you received a view of an uninspiring monochrome display of red and black. VR had been widely popularized in movies and tech mags as being a new world of amazement, an extraordinary colourful fantasy land that would blow your mind, yet Nintendo’s Virtual Boy was monochrome! Furthermore, to create an illusion of depth or a “3D” environment, games on the Virtual Boy used a parallax effect, which was not anything new or groundbreaking.</span></p>
<p><span>Why the choice of monochrome colours ? Nintendo had been very successful with bringing colourful games to their NES, Super NES and arcade cabinet games, why was Virtual Boy different ? Gunpei Yoko stated that “we experimented with a color LCD screen, but the users did not see depth, they just saw double. Colour graphics give people the impression that a game is high tech. But just because a game has a beautiful display does not mean that the game is fun to play. Red uses less battery and red is easier to recognize. That is why red is used for traffic lights.”</span></p>
<p><span>Another reason for the use of a monochrome display was due to costs. RTI’s red LED was used in Nintendo’s Virtual Boy because it was the cheapest to manufacture. A colour LCD display would have put a huge cost on the project and would have meant the store price would have put it out of reach of many people. Colour LCD displays were also said to cause “jumpy images” in device and game testing.</span></p>
<p><span>At a retail launch price of US$179.95, the Virtual Boy was far cheaper than the Sega Saturn’s US$399 and Sony’s Play Station US$299. Yet the Virtual Boy just could not meet its lofty sales targets. Nintendo Japan initially projected sales of 3 million consoles and 14 million games. Nintendo of America had projected 1.5 million Virtual Boy console units and 2.5 million in games sales by the end of the year, the reality was that Nintendo shipped 350,000 units of the Virtual Boy by December 1995, three and a half months after its North American release. Nintendo never made a PAL version of the Virtual Boy console. According to data that Nintendo provided to Famitsu after the system’s cancellation, 770,000 Virtual Boy units were sold worldwide, including 140,000 in Japan. As an indication of just how poor this is in the overall scheme of console failures, the Virtual Boy ranked 5th on Game Pro’s “Top 10 Worst Selling Consoles of All Time” list in 2007. The Virtual Boy is Nintendo’s second</span></p>
<p><span>lowest selling console after the 64DD. Virtual Boy’s sales figures pale into insignificance when compared to Nintendo’s other consoles. The Super NES had sold at least 20 million units worldwide by 1995, the NES sold 61.9 Million units while the Game Boy had sold 40 million units.</span></p>
<p><span>With such a short life span only 22 games were made for the Virtual Boy console, 14 of those released games landed in the USA. Four games were launch titles – Mario’s Tennis, Red Alarm, Teleroboxer, and Galactic Pinball. In North America, Nintendo shipped Mario’s Tennis with every Virtual Boy console sold and “3D” Tetris (1996) was the last official commercial title sold for the Virtual Boy. Nintendo did announce more games for the console at the E3 Expo in 1996, but these were never released. Most games were by Nintendo’s high standards below average, hitting the bottom of the barrel in terms of colour, graphics, gameplay and sounds. Most games were developed by Nintendo Corp with a few games like Jack Bros by Atlus and Panic Bomber by Hudson Soft developed by 3rd party game developers. Virtual Boy Wario Land is considered the best Virtual Boy game to have been released. It is one of the few games that actually<span>&nbsp; </span>takes advantage of the Virtual Boy’s hardware allowing Wario to travel back and forth between foreground and background with the environment.</span></p>
<p><span>The reason why Nintendo’s Mario is only featured tokenly …</span></p></div></div>

I could get a job, work on my businesses, sit around, watch Netflix, or work for free at tech startups.&nbsp;</p><p>I chose the latter.</p><p>Why would I work for free in a startup? It wasn’t for free; I had to pay for the train tickets and food. I didn’t care. I knew that being out there meeting founders and investors would be the best way to learn.&nbsp;</p><p>I wanted to be involved in the startup world by creating, developing, and investing in them. I believe that’s the way how we can change the world and have a positive impact.&nbsp;</p><p>But how in the world would I find those startups?</p><p>I sent 500+ emails, called companies, asked family friends, and did everything I could, but I got annoyed. So I was like, “Screw it, I’m just going to go and ask them.”</p><p>I went to this startup incubator called Techstars at 1871 and asked if they were hiring. And that I was willing to work for free or “volunteer.”</p><p>At first, the founders looked at me like, “Kid, how old even are you?” Most founders looked the other way, but two guys were like, “Damn, let’s find something for this kid to do.”</p><p>And that’s how one of my best summers started.</p><p>The founders may have thought a fifteen-year-old won’t be able to do much, but I literally told them, “I’m willing to do anything, I just want to learn and spend as much time as possible at the incubator.” It felt like I was learning by osmosis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I would go with the founders to meetings with investors and mentors and take notes, find venture capitalists interested in investing, work on hardware, and anything they told me to do.&nbsp;</p><p>I worked with three startups that developed an AI fitness assistant, solar drones, and a real estate crowdfunding site.&nbsp;</p><p>That summer showed me the world of startups. I met people like the governor, billionaires, and overall people who were heavily involved in the startup world.&nbsp;</p><p>I also experienced the startup world, which I’m sure will pay off in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>But most importantly, I met Paul, the founder who gave me the opportunity.&nbsp;</p><p>I always kept him posted on my progress in my projects and would ask how his company was doing. And Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Happy New Year messages as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, it turns out that Paul studied in the same college and did the same major. I’ve talked to him multiple times in the last few weeks and it reminded me of the <strong>importance of having people who were once where you are.</strong></p><p>Some people called people like Paul “mentors,” but that word is misleading because 1) it’s overused and over-hyped 2) it’s transactional and self-centered.&nbsp;</p><p>How do I call people like Paul? I call them, <strong>“My Future Selves.”</strong></p><p>They often can give that little push you need. And you get to cheat because you get to talk to your future self. What’s even better is that you can always do things differently and learn from their mistakes.&nbsp;</p><p>Studying engineering isn’t the easiest thing in the world and when you bomb a test, you can feel like “You don’t have what it takes.” My first chemistry exam? Hmmm. One to forget. I like to do as best as I can and not doing as expected frustrates me, especially when I need to get a good GPA to transfer to the engineering school.&nbsp;</p><p>I felt like I was the only one, but as I talked to “My Future Self” or Paul, I realized I wasn’t the only one and he too didn’t do great on his first chemistry exam. But he improved and could transfer to the engineering school.&nbsp;</p><p>He advised me on how to approach studying and how to approach the test and my grades have improved.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes, you can also lose sight of the big picture of what you want. Future selves remind you to keep focused not by scolding you but by asking you simple questions like, “What are your future plans after college?” or “Do you like what you’re studying?”</p><p>In my case, Paul knows I’m into startups and <a href="https://www.juandavidcampolargo.com/blog/ambition" target="_blank">eating the world</a>, so he helps me with choosing a path that aligns with my interests and with my goals.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking back, that was not a normal thing for a teen to do. Yes, you can say it, “I was weird.”&nbsp;</p><p>Well, not really. I knew <strong>who</strong> I was and <strong>where</strong> I wanted to go. That’s how going up to startup founders asking for a job could become your summer.&nbsp;</p><h2>How To Find Your Future Self</h2><p>If I hadn’t talked to Paul a few times since college started, I’d honestly be down and not very excited about the possibilities. <strong>Future selves can you show a path that gets you excited to work harder and more ambitiously.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>If you’re interested in finding a possible future self. I’ve learned a few lessons that can be helpful.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Avoid being artificial. </em></strong>We’ve all heard the talk, “Get a mentor and blah blah blah.” Sure, but that can’t the only reason. You should be genuine. And please please, don’t be asking people to be your mentor.&nbsp;</p><p>How can you be more genuine?</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Make yourself useful to them</p></li><li><p>Get a job or internship at that person’s company or lab</p></li><li><p>Ask unique and interesting questions</p></li><li><p>Just DM or email them</p></li></ul><p><strong><em>Understand their motivations. </em></strong>Keep this question in mind, “Why would someone want to mentor you?”</p><p>It usually happens when a high-potential person approaches them, and they can help him/her reach that potential.&nbsp; And if they can see their advice pays off 10x in you. If your future self tells you to walk 5 steps, they want to see you walk 50 steps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Don’t find mentors. </em></strong>This one will be the hardest to understand, but the most powerful. I don’t ask people, “Do you want to be my mentor?”</p><p>Most people will say “No.” Instead, the way you find mentors or future selves is by:</p><p>1) Finding people who are where you want to be.&nbsp;</p><p>2) Asking great questions and becoming genuinely interested in their work, and finally,&nbsp;</p><p>3) Keeping in contact with them and asking questions and/or advice when you need it. Or if you find something useful for them, this is when you help them.</p><p>I’m grateful to Paul and many of my other future selves because they allow me to learn from their mistakes, pick a unique path for me, and give you the little push and fresh perspective when you most need it.&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you, Paul, and thank you to all my future selves!</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Oswald Spengler was one of the most profound pessimists of modern times but at a glance, his legacy appears to have collected decades of dust since his early death in 1936.&nbsp;Considered unessential by historians and troublesome by philosophers, he nonetheless exerted an extraordinary influence over many powerful figures throughout the twentieth century. Wittgenstein said he was one of his chief inspirations; the Jungian theorist Joseph Campbell claimed Spengler’s work was his biggest influence; the philosopher Martin Heidegger was profoundly affected by Spengler’s thinking; and former Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, wrote favourably about him in his doctoral thesis ‘The Meaning of History’. Kissinger gifted a one-volume edition of Spengler’s The Decline of the West to President Nixon when he served in his administration to ‘emphasise the manifestation of events’. But who was this man whose thought has shaped modern philosophy and the perception of some of our top policy gurus, and what did he believe?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Oswald Spengler was born in the Duchy of Brunswick in 1880 to Protestant parents. His father’s family were traditionally mining engineers and metallurgical inspectors while his mother, Pauline, from whom Spengler received his irascible temperament, hailed from an artistically inclined lineage of ballet dancers and bohemians. Unlike his ancestors, his father worked as a senior postal secretary and severely chastised any hint of intellectualism in his children, a repulsion that must have conditioned the young Spengler to distrust celebrated thinkers later in his life. It was this inherited mixture of two divergent tendencies – engineering and science with bohemianism and the arts – that afforded Spengler a unique intellectual vantage and prepared him to proffer his special perspective to his readers in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After excelling in Greek, Latin, Mathematics and the Sciences at school, he attended the universities of Munich, Berlin and Halle. In 1903, two years after his father’s death, he initially failed to obtain his PhD but managed to pass a year later via an oral equivalent of the examination. He then qualified as a schoolmaster and led a relatively uneventful life teaching in Saarbrucken, Dusseldorf and Hamburg. When his mother died in 1910, he returned to Munich where he lived on his modest inheritance as a private scholar. It is said he owned no books and suffered from great loneliness rather like a latter-day Nietzsche. But, like Nietzsche, these years proved to be formative. It was around this time that he conceived of writing a book that would challenge common preconceptions of history and its meaning. He began work on&nbsp;<em>The Decline of the West&nbsp;</em>in 1911 and completed a first draft in 1914, but due to the war, he had to wait until 1918 for it to be published. Burdened with a weak heart, he was exempted from military service yet this didn’t mean he had an easy time. With much of his inheritance invested abroad, he was forced to persist in a state of serious poverty until the publication of his work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it came out, its success made him an instant celebrity and he finally gained the respect and reputation his talents deserved. His explanation of the war as a ‘historical change of phase’ which was ‘preordained for Germany hundreds of years ago’ consoled Germans who were being blamed in the European press for gratuitously starting the greatest military catastrophe of their time. In the early days of the Weimar Republic, he called himself a Socialist, but not a socialist of any obvious orthodoxy. He rejected Marx, whom he saw as the chief critic of the English capitalism he  defined as ‘Get rich, so you don’t have to work anymore’. He believed that the true source of German socialism was not Marx so much as Frederick William I. To succinctly explicate his brand of Prussian Socialism he used the phrase ‘Do your duty, work’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His Prussian subgenre of Socialism naturally appealed to National Socialists and he became an inspirational figure to some early believers of Nazism. His criticism of the Weimar Republic, of Marxism, pacifism and democracy intellectually aided the Nazis in their ideological advancement to the top of German politics, but once they were in power Spengler famously refused to ‘Heil Hitler’ and was thereafter shunned. He occupied his concluding years by collecting thousands of books and exotic primitive weapons, by reading the comedies of Moliere and Shakespeare and listening to the haunting quartets of his hero, Beethoven. He died three weeks before his fifty-sixth birthday of a sudden heart attack on 8<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;May, exactly nine years before the bloody fall of the Third Reich.</p>



<p>Like Kant, who rarely left his place of birth and was famously not convivial, Spengler lived an externally anodyne existence while his mental interior shone incandescently with original ideas. He worked in an age of Prussian militarism and German nationalism, of extraordinary revelations and dire events, when the tumultuous tide of uncontrollable circumstances invoked an apocalyptic atmosphere. His thinking therefore can be seen as an illuminating response to the blindness of his time. His magnum opus,&nbsp;<em>The Decline of the West</em>, was a rejection of Eurocentric versions of history and a repudiation of traditional structures of scholarship. He deemed the historical phases of ‘classical, medieval and modern’ as inaccurate, random and unhelpful, as a cracked encasement of human activity. He did not want to appraise the past chronologically and solely link cause to effect. He wanted to examine what was common and unique to cultures across the world, what the nature of mass existence is, and how humans see themselves through history, if at all. He called this new approach a ‘Copernican overturning’. For the study of history, it is as seminal a moment as the Newton’s shift in Physics or Descartes’s dramatic declaration of ‘Cogito ergo sum’ in Western Philosophy. This drastic development he hoped would forever transform humanity’s elemental understanding of history. However, his obscurity seems to have precluded his influence on the public and his theories remain widely unread outside the insular circles of academia.&nbsp;Perhaps the pessimism he espoused makes him appear intellectually unprofitable and therefore unattractive to the merely curious reader.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In&nbsp;<em>The Decline of the West</em>, Spengler’s ‘Copernican overturning’ led him to see past eras as loose biographies of isolated cultures. He applied the seasonal system of spring, summer, autumn and winter to the evolution and undoing of every prosperous society. They rise, flourish, wither and vanish like distinct wild flowers on a windswept heath. Spring naturally represents an awakening when the force of cultural expression is so strong that it sets a precedent for centuries thereafter. Summer signifies a stage of pleasing artistic production and clever imitations when creation becomes a personal activity. Autumn is when the soul of a culture depicts its happiness and attempts to return to nature, and winter means the solidifying of culture into a civilisation, when great art is mostly extinguished and the creative energy that drove a culture on is almost entirely spent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although there have been innumerable births of culture, Spengler argued only eight ‘high cultures’ have existed: the Babylonian, Egyptian, Indian, Sino-Japanese, Mesoamerican, Classical (Greek-Roman), Magian (or Arabian) and our own, the Faustian. Classical man was more concerned by the near and the present, whereas we children of the Faustian age are forever looking into infinity, searching for the ultimate end of our speculative powers. Sadly, he claims that the Faustian age is the most tragic because although we enjoy unprecedented technological discoveries and rapidly strive and create, we know deep down that our goals will always elude us and that our efforts will eventually be proven futile.&nbsp; To add to the dark tone he used to describe our time, he believed our culture was now in its winter phase. Lawrence Durrell opened his Alexandrian Quartet with the beautiful line ‘in the midst of winter you feel the inventions of spring’. In Spengler, this ‘feeling’ is a remembrance rather than an anticipation. The time of birth and rejuvenation is forever finished, metaphorically speaking. In this present phase, Spengler’s prophesising limns an authoritative ruler or ‘new emperor’ who emerges in response to the disintegration of culture. He called this the Caesarian age. Many Spenglerian commentators have identified the advent of Hitler and Nazism as an example of a Caesarian instance in cultural history and it would be an easy feat to find comparisons in politics today who fit the description of attributes Spengler so eerily expatiates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spengler’s approach to the philosophy of history – to how we see history and what meaning we can derive from an appraisal of past events – is informed by a myriad of unorthodox intellectual disciplines. Morphology, the study of the form and structure of organisms and their specific structural features, determines his perception of eras and their attributes. Mathematics is used to reveal the rational divergence of different cultures and to prove the sociocultural relativism of subjects that supposedly seek certainty. Art, economics, politics, literature and architecture are each discussed with a rare authority, but his factual errors and historical inaccuracies have galvanised his critics and stunted his appeal. However, Spengler’s holistic discernments distinguishes him from other philosophers of history and raises his status to a laudable level of exceptional intellectual skill. His analytical insight penetrates more deeply and disturbingly than Toynbee and his Nietzschean prose and encyclopaedically varied knowledge rewards his readers with a weird and widened perspective. Like most great thinkers, it is not the bleak conclusions he draws which are …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><figure><p>If you’re here, you’ve likely been tasked with building SAML-based SSO as a requirement for an enterprise deal. If you’re just diving into the problem space of SSO / SAML, we’d first suggest checking out <a href="https://workos.com/blog/the-developers-guide-to-sso">The Developer’s Guide to SSO</a>. Otherwise, buckle up for a brief but titillating foray into why XML-based authentication is... challenging.</p><h2>Why is SAML SSO so vulnerability-prone</h2><p>The attack surface for SAML authentication is extensive, mostly due to the fact that SAML is XML-based. <a href="https://everypageispageone.com/2016/01/28/why-does-xml-suck/">XML is a semantic-free meta-language</a> - it’s hard to form, hard to read, and hard to parse. Combined with the high complexity of the <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/sstc-saml-tech-overview-2.0.pdf">SAML specification</a> and the number of parties involved in establishing authentication, we get what often feels like a <a href="http://www.laputan.org/mud/mud.html">big ball of mud</a> and all the accompanying implications. Be prepared to tackle a steep learning curve, lots of bugs, high maintenance costs, attack vectors galore, and an absurd spread of edge cases.</p><p>Most SAML SSO security vulnerabilities are introduced by Service Providers (SPs) improperly validating and processing SAML responses received from Identity Providers (IdPs). This happens because SAML SSO is typically not a core-value feature for an application, nor is the implementation common knowledge for most developers. Unknowns become even more unlikely to be identified and addressed when the pressure is on to just deliver <em>something </em>to unblock a high-value contract - as is oftentimes the case. However, to build SAML SSO safely and securely in-house requires significant buy-in and <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/07/11/single-sign-on-sso-stack-overflow-okta-integration/">investment by teams</a> - on the scale of months, representing hundreds of thousands of dollars in developer time.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>If not done right, you expose your application and your customers to potentially huge security risks. </strong>To drive that home, here are just a few recently published SAML-related vulnerabilities:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15585">January 27, 2020</a> - “... GitLab SAML integration had a validation issue that permitted an attacker to takeover another user's account.”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-4427">May 7, 2020</a> - “... an attacker could exploit this [SAML] vulnerability to bypass the authentication process and gain full administrative access to the system [IBM Data Risk Manager].”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-21263">June 19, 2020</a> - “An attacker could authenticate to a different user's [Mattermost] account via a crafted SAML response.”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-2021">June 29, 2020</a> - “... improper verification of signatures in PAN-OS SAML authentication enables an unauthenticated network-based attacker to access protected resources.”</li></ul><p>It should be evident by now that oversights in SAML implementations are ubiquitous and problematic, even among experienced engineering teams.</p><p>So let’s dive into some of the more common security pitfalls developers building SAML-based SSO should be aware of, as well as cover a few suggested countermeasures. Just to be clear, <strong>this guide is by no means comprehensive</strong> and is meant to provide a starting point for SAML security considerations as well as some follow-on resources.</p><h2>Brief anatomy of a SAML response</h2><p>Let's say we're integrating our application with Okta via SAML. Below is an example of an XML document we might get when attempting to authenticate a user, containing a simplified but valid SAML response:</p><p>Like we mentioned earlier, the SAML spec is complex and responses can get lengthy, so this example is comparatively quite terse. Keeping things to what you should know before we go into SAML vulnerabilities, let’s walk through what the response (<strong><em>&lt;saml2p:Response&gt;</em></strong>) is communicating:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Line 2 begins the SAML response, which has the unique ID <strong><em>id72697176167120131651975993</em></strong> and is intended for consumption by the <strong><em>workos-test</em></strong> service provider’s Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL, i.e. the endpoint <strong><em>https://api.workos-test.com/auth/okta/callback</em></strong>.</li><li>Line 3 specifies the issuer (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Issuer&gt;</em></strong>) and contains the unique URI (also referred to as EntityID) of the IdP that issued the response, in this case <strong><em>http://www.okta.com/exk1klancwHzz1SNi357.</em></strong></li><li>Line 7 begins the assertion (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Assertion&gt;</em></strong>) with the unique ID <strong><em>id7269717616793800631152500</em></strong>. An assertion is a package of information asserting the identity of a user, often containing additional user attributes like first / last name, email, ID, etc.</li><li>Line 8 specifies the issuer of the assertion itself, in this case also <strong><em>http://www.okta.com/exk1klancwHzz1SNi357</em></strong>.</li><li>Lines 9 - 30 contains the digital signature (<strong><em>&lt;ds:Signature&gt;</em></strong>) over the assertion, which should be validated to determine the authenticity of the assertion.</li><li>Lines 31 - 36 specify the subject (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Subject&gt;</em></strong>) of the assertion, i.e. the authenticated principal / user corresponding to the unique identifier found in <strong><em>&lt;saml2:NameID&gt;</em></strong>, who in this case is <strong><em><a href="https://workos.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="ddb9b8b0b29daab2afb6b2aef0b2b6a9bcf3beb2b0">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></em></strong>.</li><li>Line 37 (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Conditions&gt;</em></strong>) defines the window of time for which the assertion should considered valid, i.e. from <strong><em>NotBefore</em></strong> (inclusive) to <strong><em>NotOnOrAfter</em></strong> (exclusive).</li></ul><p>For the purposes of readability, the SAML 2.0 XML snippets in the remainder of this blog will be simplified, use shorthand, and be stripped of nodes that would otherwise be required in reality but are not relevant to what’s being illustrated. We’ll use a mythical IssueTracker, ContractManager, and PayrollService as hypothetical SPs that have implemented SAML authentication, which you should think of as placeholders for your application or other SAML SSO-enabled apps.</p><h2>Disable DTD processing</h2><p>The first step in processing a SAML response is parsing the payload. Parsing and loading an XML document into memory is an inherently expensive set of operations, but can be unexpectedly costly due to a feature of XML that allows references to external or remote documents, i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_type_definition">Document Type Definitions</a> (DTDs).</p><p>When a DTD is encountered, parsers will try to fetch and load the referenced document as well. If the referenced document is large enough or results in infinitely looping references, your server can be slowed or even brought down trying to complete the process. The same holds true if the payload itself is very large, DTDs or not.</p><p>Two low-hanging mitigations you should implement to prevent buffer overflows are:<br></p><ol role="list"><li>Limiting SAML payload size to &lt; 1MB. 1MB is a generous upper limit and should be tuned down based on average received payload size.</li><li>Configuring your XML parser to never fetch remote files or try to load and parse DTDs. Some XML parsers do so by default, for example, Python’s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html"><strong><em>xml.etree.ElementTree</em></strong></a> module.</li></ol><p>XML processing, and thus by extension SAML response processing, is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks from other scenarios described later on in this post. And unfortunately, protecting your application from a service outage is among the most mild of outcomes compared to the <a href="https://www.vsecurity.com//download/papers/XMLDTDEntityAttacks.pdf">possibilities exploiting XML DTD</a> allows - it is a dark and anxiety-inducing rabbit hole.</p><p>So, if you’re not writing your own XML parser (generally not suggested), it’s important to <strong>vet the XML parser(s) your application and its dependencies use</strong> - ensure they handle other exploits like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack">Billion Laughs</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb">Zip Bombs</a>.</p><h2>Validate the SAML response schema first<br></h2><p>The primary security mechanism in the SAML handshake is the cryptographic validation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Signature">XML Signatures</a> (XML-DSig) - which establishes the trust chain between IdPs and SPs. XML-DSig validation should always be done prior to executing business logic; however, the separation between signature verification and operating on the rest of a SAML payload opens up SAML authentication to vulnerabilities exposed by what are called XML Signature Wrapping (XSW) attacks. &nbsp;These attacks have numerous permutations which can result in outcomes such as (but not limited to):<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Denial-of-service by inserting arbitrary elements that lead to buffer overflows.</li><li>Escalating permissions by injecting assertions that allow an adversary to impersonate and be authenticated as another user, like an account admin.</li></ul><p>The exploit here consists of modifying the payload without invalidating any signatures - think <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection">SQL Injection</a> or <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/">Cross Site Scripting,</a> but for for XML.</p><p>Original response (pre-XSW):</p><p>Modified response (post-XSW):</p><p>The broadest countermeasure to XSW attacks is <strong>validating the schema</strong> of the SAML XML document. Payloads for SAML responses of any given IdP should have a deterministic standard schema that can be used as a reference in a schema compliance validation module, which should be executed prior to XML-DSig verification. Here are <a href="https://github.com/onelogin/python3-saml/tree/master/src/onelogin/saml2/schemas">example schemas</a> used by OneLogin’s <strong><em>python3-saml</em></strong> package to perform <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/python-saml/library/saml2.html#saml2.utils.OneLogin_Saml2_Utils.validate_xml">XML schema validation</a>. <strong>Schemas should be vetted local copies</strong> as opposed to being fetched from 3rd party remote locations at runtime or on server start.</p><p>All of that being said, <a href="https://www.nds.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/media/nds/veroeffentlichungen/2013/03/25/paper.pdf">schema validation isn’t foolproof</a>; there is room for error in the validation module logic itself, as well as in the syntactic rigor of the reference schema. A second low-hanging countermeasure to XSW attacks that should be employed for the sake of redundancy is to <strong>always use absolute XPath expressions</strong> to select elements in processes post-schema validation. Explicit absolute XPath expressions set an unambiguous expectation for the location of elements.</p><p>Here’s an example of a valid response that’s been modified in an XSW attack (specifically a signature exclusion attack, more on that later):</p><p>This modification also exploits the common, incorrect, but not unreasonable assumption that a well-formed SAML response will only ever have a single assertion. So while XML-DSig verification would succeed for the signature returned by <strong><em>doc.getElementsByTagName(“Signature”)[0]</em></strong>, the assertion returned and processed by <strong><em>doc.getElementsByTagName(“Assertion”)[0]</em></strong> would be the injected <strong><em>snek</em></strong> assertion. This attack would have been more likely to fail if the XPath expression&nbsp;<strong><em>“/Response/Assertion[0]/Signature”</em></strong> was used in the assertion signature validation logic.</p><h2>Check that you’re the intended recipient</h2><p>This sounds obvious, but make sure to check that a SAML response is intended for your app. This is low-hanging fruit that can prevent attacks exploiting IdPs that use a shared private signing key for all integrated SPs of a given tenant, as opposed to issuing unique keys per application. The most common attack entails the …</p></figure></div></div></div>

    <p>Today I want to demonstrate a “well-known” Haskell technique among library authors, that I haven’t ever seen written down. It allows you to do all sorts of amazing things, such as: generate lenses for arbitrary data-types without resorting to TemplateHaskell; <code>sequence</code> over data-types; and automatically track dependencies for usages of record fields.</p>
<p>As for this post, we’ll look at how to build type-level sequencing, and investigate some other uses in subsequent ones. For our examples, let’s define the following (completely arbitrary) data-type:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a><span>data</span> <span>Person</span> <span>=</span> <span>Person</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2"></a>  {<span> pName ::</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3"></a>  ,<span> pAge  ::</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4"></a>  } <span>deriving</span> (<span>Generic</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>That’s cool and all, I guess. For purposes of discussion, let’s imagine that we want to let the user fill in a <code>Person</code> via a web-form or something. Which is to say, it’s possible they’ll screw up filling in some piece of information without necessarily invalidating the rest of the datastructure. If they successfully filled in the entire structure, we’d like to get a <code>Person</code> out.</p>
<p>One way of modeling this would be with a second datatype:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>data</span> <span>MaybePerson</span> <span>=</span> <span>MaybePerson</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a>  {<span> mpName ::</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3"></a>  ,<span> mpAge  ::</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4"></a>  } <span>deriving</span> (<span>Generic</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>and a function:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a><span>validate ::</span> <span>MaybePerson</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Person</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2"></a>validate (<span>MaybePerson</span> name age) <span>=</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3"></a>  <span>Person</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> name <span>&lt;*&gt;</span> age</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This works, but it’s annoying to write by hand, since it’s completely mechanical. Furthermore, having duplicated this effort means we’ll need to use our brains in the future to make sure all three definitions stay in sync. Wouldn’t it be cool if the compiler could help with this?</p>
<p>SURPRISE! IT CAN! And that’s what I want to talk about today.</p>
<p>Notice that we can describe both <code>Person</code> and <code>MaybePerson</code> with the following higher-kinded data (henceforth “<strong>HKD</strong>”) definition:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a><span>data</span> <span>Person'</span> f <span>=</span> <span>Person</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2"></a>  {<span> pName ::</span> f <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3"></a>  ,<span> pAge  ::</span> f <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a href="#cb4-4"></a>  } <span>deriving</span> (<span>Generic</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here we’ve parameterized <code>Person'</code> over something <code>f</code> (of kind <code>* -&gt; *</code>), which allows us to do the following in order to get our original types back:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1"></a><span>type</span> <span>Person</span>      <span>=</span> <span>Person'</span> <span>Identity</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2"></a><span>type</span> <span>MaybePerson</span> <span>=</span> <span>Person'</span> <span>Maybe</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>While this works, it’s kind of annoying in the <code>Person</code> case, since now all of our data is wrapped up inside of an <code>Identity</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; :t pName @Identity
pName :: Person -&gt; Identity String

&gt; :t runIdentity . pName
runIdentity . pName :: Person -&gt; String</code></pre>
<p>We can fix this annoyance trivially, after which we will look at why defining <code>Person'</code> as such is actually useful. To get rid of the <code>Identity</code>s, we can use a type family (a function at the type-level) that erases them:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1"></a><span>{-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies #-}</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2"></a></span>
<span id="cb7-3"><a href="#cb7-3"></a><span>-- "Higher-Kinded Data"</span></span>
<span id="cb7-4"><a href="#cb7-4"></a><span>type</span> <span>family</span> <span>HKD</span> f a <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb7-5"><a href="#cb7-5"></a>  <span>HKD</span> <span>Identity</span> a <span>=</span> a</span>
<span id="cb7-6"><a href="#cb7-6"></a>  <span>HKD</span> f        a <span>=</span> f a</span>
<span id="cb7-7"><a href="#cb7-7"></a></span>
<span id="cb7-8"><a href="#cb7-8"></a><span>data</span> <span>Person'</span> f <span>=</span> <span>Person</span></span>
<span id="cb7-9"><a href="#cb7-9"></a>  {<span> pName ::</span> <span>HKD</span> f <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb7-10"><a href="#cb7-10"></a>  ,<span> pAge  ::</span> <span>HKD</span> f <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb7-11"><a href="#cb7-11"></a>  } <span>deriving</span> (<span>Generic</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Using the <code>HKD</code> type family means that GHC will automatically erase any <code>Identity</code> wrappers in our representations:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; :t pName @Identity
pName :: Person -&gt; String

&gt; :t pName @Maybe
pName :: Person -&gt; Maybe String</code></pre>
<p>and with that, the higher-kinded version of <code>Person</code> can be used as a drop-in replacement for our original one. The obvious question is what have we bought ourselves with all of this work. Let’s look back at <code>validate</code> to help us answer this question. Compare our old implementation:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1"></a><span>validate ::</span> <span>MaybePerson</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Person</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2"><a href="#cb9-2"></a>validate (<span>MaybePerson</span> name age) <span>=</span></span>
<span id="cb9-3"><a href="#cb9-3"></a>  <span>Person</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> name <span>&lt;*&gt;</span> age</span></code></pre></div>
<p>with how we can now rewrite it with our new machinery:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1"></a><span>validate ::</span> <span>Person'</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Person</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2"><a href="#cb10-2"></a>validate (<span>Person</span> name age) <span>=</span></span>
<span id="cb10-3"><a href="#cb10-3"></a>  <span>Person</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> name <span>&lt;*&gt;</span> age</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Not a very interesting change is it? But the intrigue lies in how little needed to change. As you can see, only our type and pattern match needed to change from our original implementation. What’s neat here is that we have now consolidated <code>Person</code> and <code>MaybePerson</code> into the same representation, and therefore they are no longer related only in a nominal sense.</p>
<p>We can write a version of <code>validate</code> that will work for any higher-kinded datatype.</p>
<p>The secret is to turn to <a href="https://www.stackage.org/haddock/lts-11.0/base-4.10.1.0/GHC-Generics.html"><code>GHC.Generics</code></a>. If you’re unfamiliar with them, they provide an isomorphism from a regular Haskell datatype to a generic representation that can be structurally manipulated by a clever programmer (ie: us.) By providing code for what to do for constant types, products and coproducts, we can get GHC to write type-independent code for us. It’s a really neat technique that will tickle your toes if you haven’t seen it before.</p>
<p>To start with, we need to define a typeclass that will be the workhorse of our transformation. In my experience, this is always the hardest part – the types of these generic-transforming functions are exceptionally abstract and in my opinion, very hard to reason about. I came up with this:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1"></a><span>{-# LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses #-}</span></span>
<span id="cb11-2"><a href="#cb11-2"></a></span>
<span id="cb11-3"><a href="#cb11-3"></a><span>class</span> <span>GValidate</span> i o <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb11-4"><a href="#cb11-4"></a><span>  gvalidate ::</span> i p <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> (o p)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I only have “soft-and-slow” rules for reasoning about what your typeclass should look like, but in general you’re going to need both an <code>i</code>nput and an <code>o</code>utput parameter. They both need to be of kind <code>* -&gt; *</code> and then be passed this existentialized <code>p</code>, for dark, unholy reasons known not by humankind. I then have a little checklist I walk through to help me wrap my head around this nightmarish hellscape that we’ll walk through in a later installment of the series.</p>
<p>Anyway, with our typeclass in hand, it’s now just a matter of writing out instances of our typeclass for the various GHC.Generic types. We can start with the base case, which is we should be able to validate a <code>Maybe k</code>:</p>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1"><a href="#cb12-1"></a><span>{-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances #-}</span></span>
<span id="cb12-2"><a href="#cb12-2"></a><span>{-# LANGUAGE TypeOperators     #-}</span></span>
<span id="cb12-3"><a href="#cb12-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb12-4"><a href="#cb12-4"></a><span>instance</span> <span>GValidate</span> (<span>K1</span> a (<span>Maybe</span> k)) (<span>K1</span> a k) <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb12-5"><a href="#cb12-5"></a>  <span>-- gvalidate :: K1 a (Maybe k) -&gt; Maybe (K1 a k)</span></span>
<span id="cb12-6"><a href="#cb12-6"></a>  gvalidate (<span>K1</span> k) <span>=</span> <span>K1</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> k</span>
<span id="cb12-7"><a href="#cb12-7"></a>  <span>{-# INLINE gvalidate #-}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>K1</code> represents a “constant type”, which is to say that it’s where our structural recursion conks out. In our <code>Person'</code> example, it’s the <code>pName :: HKD f String</code> bit.</p>
<p>Most of the time, once you have the base case in place, the rest is to just mechanically provide instances for the other types. Unless you need to access metadata about the original type anywhere, these instances will almost always be trivial homomorphisms.</p>
<p>We can start with products – if we have <code>GValidate i o</code> and <code>GValidate i' o'</code>, we should be able to run them in parallel:</p>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1"><a href="#cb13-1"></a><span>instance</span> (<span>GValidate</span> i o, <span>GValidate</span> i' o')</span>
<span id="cb13-2"><a href="#cb13-2"></a>    <span>=&gt;</span> <span>GValidate</span> (i <span>:*:</span> i') (o <span>:*:</span> o') <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb13-3"><a href="#cb13-3"></a>  gvalidate (l <span>:*:</span> r) <span>=</span> (<span>:*:</span>)</span>
<span id="cb13-4"><a href="#cb13-4"></a>                    <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> gvalidate l</span>
<span id="cb13-5"><a href="#cb13-5"></a>                    <span>&lt;*&gt;</span> gvalidate r</span>
<span id="cb13-6"><a href="#cb13-6"></a>  <span>{-# INLINE gvalidate #-}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If <code>K1</code> referred directly to the selectors of our <code>Person'</code>, <code>(:*:)</code> corresponds roughly to the <code>,</code> piece of syntax we separate our record fields with.</p>
<p>We can define a similar instance of <code>GValidate</code> for coproducts (corresponding to a <code>|</code> in a data definition):</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1"><a href="#cb14-1"></a><span>instance</span> (<span>GValidate</span> i o, <span>GValidate</span> i' o')</span>
<span id="cb14-2"><a href="#cb14-2"></a>    <span>=&gt;</span> <span>GValidate</span> (i <span>:+:</span> i') (o <span>:+:</span> o') <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb14-3"><a href="#cb14-3"></a>  gvalidate (<span>L1</span> l) <span>=</span> <span>L1</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> gvalidate l</span>
<span id="cb14-4"><a href="#cb14-4"></a>  gvalidate (<span>R1</span> r) <span>=</span> <span>R1</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> gvalidate r</span>
<span id="cb14-5"><a href="#cb14-5"></a>  <span>{-# INLINE gvalidate #-}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Furthermore, if we don’t care about looking at metadata, we can simply lift a <code>GValidate i o</code> over the metadata constructor:</p>
<div id="cb15"><pre><code><span id="cb15-1"><a href="#cb15-1"></a><span>instance</span> <span>GValidate</span> i o</span>
<span id="cb15-2"><a href="#cb15-2"></a>    <span>=&gt;</span> <span>GValidate</span> (<span>M1</span> _a _b i) (<span>M1</span> _a' _b' o) <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb15-3"><a href="#cb15-3"></a>  gvalidate (<span>M1</span> x) <span>=</span> <span>M1</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> gvalidate x</span>
<span id="cb15-4"><a href="#cb15-4"></a>  <span>{-# INLINE gvalidate #-}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Just for kicks, we can provide the following trivial instances, for uninhabited types (<code>V1</code>) and for constructors without any parameters (<code>U1</code>):</p>
<div id="cb16"><pre><code><span id="cb16-1"><a href="#cb16-1"></a><span>instance</span> <span>GValidate</span> <span>V1</span> <span>V1</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb16-2"><a href="#cb16-2"></a>  gvalidate <span>=</span> <span>undefined</span></span>
<span id="cb16-3"><a href="#cb16-3"></a>  <span>{-# INLINE gvalidate #-}</span></span>
<span id="cb16-4"><a href="#cb16-4"></a></span>
<span id="cb16-5"><a href="#cb16-5"></a><span>instance</span> <span>GValidate</span> <span>U1</span> <span>U1</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb16-6"><a href="#cb16-6"></a>  gvalidate <span>U1</span> <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>U1</span></span>
<span id="cb16-7"><a href="#cb16-7"></a>  <span>{-# INLINE gvalidate #-}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The use of <code>undefined</code> here is safe, since it can only be called with a value of <code>V1</code>. Fortunately for us, <code>V1</code> is uninhabited, so this can never happen, and thus we’re morally correct in our usage of <code>undefined</code>.</p>
<p>Without further ado, now that we have all of this machinery out of the way, we can finally write a non-generic version of <code>validate</code>:</p>

<p>I always get a goofy smile when the signature for my function is longer than the actual implementation; it means we’ve hired the compiler to write code for us. What’s neat about <code>validate</code> here is that it doesn’t have any mention of <code>Person'</code>; this function will work for <em>any</em> type defined as higher-kinded data. Spiffy.</p>
<p>That’s all for today, folks. We’ve been introduced to the idea of higher-kinded data, seen how it’s completely equivalent with a datatype defined in a more traditional fashion, and also caught a glimmer of what kind of things are possible with this approach. This is where we stop for today, but in the next post we’ll look at how we can use the HKD approach to generate lenses without resorting to TemplateHaskell.</p>
<p>Happy higher-kinding!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div onclick="clearMenu()"><div><p>Thursday, September
24th,
2020</p><hr><p>Semantic versioning is a surprisingly interesting topic when you get into it. Recently, myself and a few colleagues (<a href="http://patricklam.ca/">Patrick</a> &amp; <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jensdietrich/">Jens</a>) have been giving it some thought (and we even wrote an <a href="https://whileydave.com/publications/ldp20/">essay on it</a>)! If you haven’t seen it already, check out the <a href="https://semver.org/">manifesto for semantic versioning</a>. Whilst that provides a nice overview, there is a lot left unsaid. There are two different perspectives on semantic versioning:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Downstream</strong>. This is perhaps the more obvious scenario. Downstream developers (clients) want access to the library features offered by (upstream) developers! They also want both <em>stability</em> and <em>protection</em>. That is, they don’t want future releases of a library to break their code but (ideally) they want to get future releases automatically (e.g. for critical security updates).</p></li><li><p><strong>Upstream</strong>. On the flip-side, upstream (library) developers want <em>flexibility</em> to continue improving their libraries with new features, refactorings, etc. They also want to fix bugs and security vulnerabilities as and when they arise.</p></li></ol><p>In some sense, semantic versioning is just a communication mechanism between upstream and downstream developers. Now, a three point version number is (at best) a low fidelity communication channel. <em>But, this post is not about that</em>. Rather, it is about figuring out how to make the most of semantic versioning as it is.</p><h3 id="economics">Economics</h3><p>An important aspect of semantic versioning is <em>trust</em>. Downstream developers must trust upstream developers not to break the protocol (e.g. by putting out minor releases with breaking changes). When trust is lost, clients become hesitant to upgrade and the <em>lag</em> between a new release and the client upgrading increases. This makes sense as clients balance the costs of upgrading against their benefits. For example, if upgrading requires only a few minor tweaks to your code base, but offers important security patches then it seems worth it. But, when upgrading requires significant changes to your code (e.g. because library developer decided randomly to refactor the API) and the only benefit is some features you don’t need — it doesn’t.</p><p><em>We can view all this through the lens of economic theory and treat it as a market system</em>. Then, trustworthy upstream developers should succeed where others fail, etc. This seems like that’s it all sorted out! But, the reality is different as, unfortunately, mistakes are made all the time by developers we think should be trustworthy (see examples below). The problem is that the system is not yet efficient because:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Downstream developers</strong> have real difficulties determining what the costs and benefits are.</p></li><li><p><strong>Upstream developers</strong> cannot easily tell when they inadvertently make breaking changes (more on this below).</p></li></ol><p><em>In thinking about this, we’re interested in what techniques could be brought to bear on this to make the market system more efficient.</em></p><h3 id="breaking-changes">Breaking Changes</h3><p>An important question here is: <em>what are “breaking changes” anyway?</em> Knowing this is somehow key to a smoothly functioning system. Some thoughts:</p><ul><li><p><em>Should a change of license be considered a breaking change?</em></p></li><li><p><em>Should a bug-fix which changes an implementation’s behaviour be considered a breaking change?</em></p></li><li><p><em>Should a change which degrades system performance be considered breaking?</em></p></li><li><p><em>Should a change to the contract of a method be considered breaking?</em></p></li><li><p><em>Should a change in the <em>purity</em> of a method be considered breaking?</em></p></li><li><p><em>Should a change in the order of elements returned by a method be considered breaking?</em></p></li></ul><p>Most of these could be considered breaking changes in certain
situations (i.e. depending on the client):</p><p><strong>Exhibit A.</strong> Firefox (downstream developer) uses
<a href="http://fontconfig.org/">fontconfig</a> (upstream developer). A
<a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/fontconfig/commit/?id=95af7447dba7c54ed162b667c0bb2ea6500e8f32">commit</a>
to fontconfig <code>v2.10.92</code> meant it now rejected empty filenames. It’s
documentation didn’t say whether empty filenames were allowed or not,
<em>so this was reasonable right?</em> Well, it <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=857922">broke
Firefox</a>.</p><p><strong>Exhibit B.</strong> <a href="https://jsoup.org/">JSoup</a> <code>v1.10.1</code> included a
performance refactoring for “<em>reducing memory allocation and garbage
collection</em>”. Again, this seemed reasonable but clients quickly
started <a href="https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/830">reporting problems</a>.</p><p>These are just some examples and you can easily find more with a
little digging. The point is that upstream developers miss (or
ignore) changes affecting downstream clients all the time. <em>So, what
can we do?</em></p><h3 id="tooling">Tooling</h3><p><a href="https://revapi.org/">RevAPI</a> provides food-for-thought here. If you haven’t come across it before, this tool compares two versions of a Jar file and identifies certain kinds of breaking change. Examples of breaking changes include: reducing the visibility of a method; removing a <code>public</code> declaration; or, modifying a <code>public</code> class so that it no longer implements some interface. <em>This is actually awesome!</em> <em>People should use this stuff all the time!</em></p><p>Our interest here is not what the tool thinks <em>are</em> breaking changes, but what it <em>doesn’t</em>. For example, when a method no longer accepts <code>null</code> for some parameter, or moves from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">linear to quadratic time</a>, or returns the elements of an array in a different order, etc. Ok, we have to be reasonable — one tool cannot do everything and these are <em>hard</em> problems. Still, RevAPI offers a glimmer of hope that semantics versioning could be much more than it currently is. And, there are others:
<a href="https://medium.com/@Max_Goldstein/how-to-publish-an-elm-package-3053b771e545">Elm Bump</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rust-dev-tools/rust-semverver">rust-semverver</a>, and <a href="http://clirr.sourceforge.net/">clirr</a> to name a few.</p><p><em>So, there should be tools, and lots of 'em!</em> Both upstream <em>and</em> downstream developers should be using them to spot inadvertent breaking changes, or to gauge the cost of upgrades. Whilst current tools are fairly shallow in their assessment of breaking changes, there is a wealth of techniques from fields like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis">static analysis</a> and automated testing which could be used here.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>Well, that’s enough for now!! If you made it this far, then you should check out our <a href="https://whileydave.com/publications/ldp20/">essay</a> which goes into way more detail.</p><p>And finally, just to get you thinking, here’s a cool idea for upstream
developers: <strong>know your dependencies!</strong> These days, its easy to find
your downstream clients. Before releasing a new version, just check
for breaking changes by <em>running all your clients’ tests!</em> That’s
exactly what <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/crater">Crater does for
Rust</a> and also what <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3379597.3387476">these
folks</a> and
<a href="https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2018/9239/">these folks</a>
are suggesting.</p><h3 id="related-articles">Related Articles</h3><p>Here are a few related articles on semantic versioning which are definitely worth a read!</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://gist.github.com/jashkenas/cbd2b088e20279ae2c8e">Why Semantic Versioning Isn’t</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/12/16/semantic-versioning">Semantic Versioning Sucks!

That means, that they will be wrapped with quotes in the output. Notice That <code>nargs</code> don't have quotes, so I have to insert them manually. That is because sometimes you want to use something like <code>argparse.REMAINDER</code> or some other variables.</p>
      <p id="0ca4dfec-cc78-4545-bcc7-aa4c99620743">You can also choose actions and it changes some of the properties in the table. For example, I want the second argument to be binary, so I choose <code>store_true</code> from the dropdown menu.</p>

  -f [FILE [FILE ...]], --file [FILE [FILE ...]]
                        List of input files.
  -s, --something       Some binary switch.</code></pre>
      
      <p id="1b0289e3-683d-4b06-a7d4-f093d8ca4942">Although the code is old and unmaintained for long time (last commit 2016), it still works as expected and I use it every time I need to add some argparse interface. It massively lowers the cognitive load, so I don't have to remember all kind argument types and parameters. And it works fine for python3, although it was meant for 2.7.</p>
      <p id="b9f1f916-2b1b-4a04-81a8-6e267cbffec6">I highly suggest remembering the keywords <em>"argparse builder"</em> and just google it next time you need to add argparse interface to your script, it should be first result in google.</p>

  </figure><p>Our team evaluated several options, and wound up pursuing a pragmatic approach which we were able to implement for our entire application in less than six weeks. We are excited to share some details for others who might be thinking through similar decisions.</p><h2>State of the Art</h2><p>There are two dominant approaches to multi-user collaboration today: <strong>Operational Transforms</strong> and <strong>Conflict-free Replicated Data Types</strong>. Both are powerful, although they come with trade-offs that make implementation challenging, particularly for smaller teams like ours. There is also a lesser-known hybrid approach—originally pioneered by Figma—geared towards ease of implementation.</p><h3>Operational Transforms</h3><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Operational Transforms</a> (OT) has been around for years. This technology is famously used to back Google Docs, and there are a number of reference implementations available on the web.</p><div><div><p><strong>The basic idea of OT</strong> is to decompose all state mutations to specific operations.</p><p>As an example, let's say we want two editors to simultaneously edit the string <code>ello</code>. Editor 1 sends an operation that inserts <code>!</code> at position 4 (or <code>[!, 4]</code> for short) and Editor 2 sends another operation that inserts <code>H</code> at position 0 (or <code>[H, 0]</code>).</p><p>If received in this order, a client can process these operations as they are and get the desired text <code>Hello!</code>. However, if a client were to receive <code>[H, 0]</code> first and <code>[!, 4]</code> second, the resulting string would be the incorrect <code>Hell!o</code>. OT implementations need to account for this, and implement a transformation to correct or "transform" the second operation to <code>[!, 5]</code> in order to preserve the user's intent and get <code>Hello!</code>.</p></div></div><p>In order to properly broker operations between clients, OT requires a centralized server, which may not be acceptable for all use cases.</p><p>OT offers a lot of control to the developer over how user actions are de-conflicted, making it easy to preserve user intent and context.</p><p>The "transform" part, however, can be quite tricky and error-prone since an implementor needs to account for each pair of operations. The number of possible combinations grows quadratically with the number of operations, meaning even with extensive testing it's possible to miss an edge case. This combinatorial complexity means an application gets harder and harder to reason about over time. <sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></p><h3>Conflict-free Replicated Data Types</h3><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Conflict-free Replicated Data Types</a> (CRDTs) are a newer alternative that sidesteps much of the complexity that burdens OT.</p><div><div><p><strong>The basic idea of CRDT</strong> is to use data structures that are inherently (you guessed it) conflict-free.</p><p>There are <a href="https://github.com/pfrazee/crdt_notes/tree/68c5fe81ade109446a9f4c24e03290ec5493031f#portfolio-of-basic-crdts" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">several different CRDTs</a>, each with their own implementation details. An example CRDT is a <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/java-conflict-free-replicated-data-types#grow-only-set" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Grow Only Set</a>, which can only have elements added to it, but never removed. Conflicts are avoided since it is impossible to add/remove an item at the same time.</p><p>A multiplayer application can compose different types of CRDTs to create more complex structures for modeling its state.</p></div></div><p>CRDTs avoid the combinatorial complexity that comes along with OT, and also enable direct client-to-client communication, removing the need for a central server. Despite these advantages, they still have major trade-offs.</p><p>While CRDTs are correct from a mathematical standpoint, they might not have the correct semantics for a specific application. For example, the result of a state mutation is always consistent, but it may not be exactly what was expected since it's possible to lose user intent. <sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup></p><p>CRDTs also trade off the complexity of resolving conflicts for a more challenging initial implementation, due to their reliance on algorithms like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_clock" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">vector clocks</a>. They also incur a fair amount of storage overhead—while there is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7drE24geUw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3198" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">progress being made</a>, avoiding this problem requires foresight and cleverness. And since CRDTs are newer, there are fewer reference implementations. <sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup></p><h3>Figma's Hybrid Approach</h3><p>While at first we considered OT and CRDTs as our two main options, we were intrigued by <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the pragmatic approach taken by Figma</a>. They borrowed some ideas from CRDTs, like a <a href="https://github.com/pfrazee/crdt_notes/tree/68c5fe81ade109446a9f4c24e03290ec5493031f#last-writer-wins-register-lww-register" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">last-writer-wins data register</a>. Instead of using vector clocks to provide an ordering guarantee, however, they used a central authority, similar to OT.</p><p>By using the best parts of both OT and CRDTs, Figma avoided challenges with de-conflicting operations and difficulty of implementation. The main trade-off is that certain functionality, such as multi-user editable text strings, is not easily supported.</p><p>Figma's hybrid technique resonated with us as being both practical and elegant, although it was surprising that we couldn't find examples of others pursuing a similar approach. <sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup></p><p>

<figcaption>From Figma's Blog Post</figcaption></p><h2>Choosing a Path</h2><p>As we assessed our options, we weighed a few key factors:</p><h3>Taking it step by step</h3><p>It was important to us that our solution was <a href="https://hex.tech/blog/incremental-shipping" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">shippable incrementally</a> and completable within a reasonable time frame. Any solution that required rewriting significant parts of our code base all at once, or a "big bang" cutover, would have not been acceptable.</p><h3>Our current stack</h3><p>Some existing multiplayer frameworks, such as <a href="https://github.com/share/sharedb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ShareDB</a>, require storing the model in a specific format and shape, or that the frontend connects to the model in a particular way.</p><p>We wanted to avoid major changes like this. An ideal solution would need to work well with our current tools, including:</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Apollo + GraphQL</a> to build an API schema shared by our frontend and backend services</li>
<li><a href="https://graphql-code-generator.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GraphQL Code Generator</a> and Typescript to ensure type safety across the entire stack</li>
<li><a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Apollo Client</a> on the frontend to store requested data in a normalized object cache that allows React to intelligently subscribe to changes</li>
<li>PostgreSQL and relational database patterns/features like normalization, constraints, and transactions to help guarantee data consistency and correctness</li>
</ul><p>This stack strikes a good balance between feature velocity and stability, and we wanted to build on top of it—not replace it.</p><h3>Controlling our destiny</h3><p>As we considered these approaches, we evaluated a number of open source libraries. We're generally enthusiastic about adopting and contributing to OSS, and originally thought to do so here.</p><p>While there are some great projects out there, like <a href="https://github.com/automerge/automerge" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Automerge</a> and <a href="https://github.com/yjs/yjs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Y.js</a>, it can be risky to outsource something as core as our application state. Even really promising projects can lose momentum: <a href="https://github.com/Operational-Transformation/ot.js/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ot.js</a>, for example, is an Operational Transform library with over 1.2k stars on Github, but is no longer under active development and is looking for a maintainer.</p><h2>Atomic Operations</h2><p>After considering our options, we pursued an approach inspired by Figma's hybrid solution. We call it <strong>Atomic Operations (AO),</strong> as all edits to application state are broken down to their smallest <em>atomic</em> parts.</p><p>For us, this technique struck the right balance between ease of implementation, compatibility with our stack, and control over the application foundations.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><h3>Splitting the Atom</h3><p>AO mutations exist at the single property update level, such that <strong>two operations of different types cannot conflict with each other.</strong></p><p>It is, however, still possible for two operations of the <em>same type</em> to conflict. This is determined by an operation's <code>conflictId</code>, which is a concatenation of its type and the ID of the object being edited. <sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup> Since we use last-writer-wins semantics, we don't merge conflicts, we just pick a winner.</p><p>For determining which operation is "last", the server keeps track of a monotonically increasing counter per object that increments with each write. Upon acknowledging an operation, the server includes the latest value of this counter. To determine which operation is a winner, the client simply chooses the operation with the higher value. A central authority is required to implement this monotonic counter, prohibiting any distributed implementations.</p><p>As an example, take a hypothetical object type "foobar":</p><div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>interface</span> <span>Foobar</span> <span>{</span>
  id<span>:</span> <span>string</span>
  name<span>:</span> <span>string</span>
  color<span>:</span> <span>string</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>Here are some examples of atomic operations for creating and editing a foobar:</p><div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>type</span><span>:</span> <span>"CREATE_FOOBAR"</span><span>,</span>
  conflictId<span>:</span> <span>"CREATE_FOOBAR-123ABC"</span><span>,</span>
  payload<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    id<span>:</span> <span>"123ABC"</span><span>,</span>
    name<span>:</span> <span>"My new foobar"</span><span>,</span>
    color<span>:</span> <span>"#DE1738"</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>{</span>
  <span>type</span><span>:</span> <span>"SET_FOOBAR_COLOR"</span><span>,</span>
  conflictId<span>:</span> <span>"SET_FOOBAR_COLOR-123ABC"</span><span>,</span>
  creationId<span>:</span> <span>"CREATE_FOOBAR-123ABC"</span><span>,</span>
  payload<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    id<span>:</span> <span>"123ABC"</span><span>,</span>
    newColor<span>:</span> <span>"#0B6623"</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>Again: by breaking down all edits to a foobar object to changing individual properties, we remove the need to worry about how different operations might merge—<strong>at this level of granularity, only one write <em>can</em> win.</strong></p><p>A nice benefit of this decomposition is that all mutations to state are described by plain objects. A keen eye might note some parallels with how <a href="https://redux.js.org/basics/actions" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Redux defines actions</a>, and indeed AO similarly benefits from making state mutations predictable, transparent, and easily testable.</p><p>Finally, we implemented undo / redo by requiring all atomic operation to include an additional operation that can undo the change. As an example:</p><div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>type</span><span>:</span> <span>"SET_FOOBAR_NAME"</span><span>,</span>
  conflictId<span>:</span> <span>"SET_FOOBAR_NAME-123ABC"</span><span>,</span>
  creationId<span>:</span> <span>"CREATE_FOOBAR-123ABC"</span><span>,</span>
  payload<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    id<span>:</span> <span>"123ABC"</span><span>,</span>
    newName<span>:</span> <span>"My slightly less new foobar"</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  undo<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>type</span><span>:</span> <span>"SET_FOOBAR_NAME"</span><span>,</span>
    conflictId<span>:</span> <span>"SET_FOOBAR_NAME-123ABC"</span><span>,</span>
    creationId<span>:</span> <span>"CREATE_FOOBAR-123ABC"</span><span>,</span>
    payload<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
      id<span>:</span> <span>"123ABC"</span><span>,</span>
      newName<span>:</span> <span>"My new foobar"</span> 
    <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><h3>Getting fractional</h3><p>A drawback of AO is that certain types of mutations can be difficult to express as simple last-writer-wins operations.</p><p>One such case is ordered collections. With classic integer indexing of a collection, …</p></div></div></div>

          networks</a>. NSL provides a simulation environment simplifying the 
          task of modeling neural networks. In particular, NSL supports neural 
          models having as basic data structure neural layers with similar properties 
          and similar connection patterns, where neurons are modeled as leaky 
          integrators with connections subject to diverse learning rules. Development 
          of NSL has gone hand in hand with modeling of neural mechanisms underlying 
          visuomotor coordination, with special emphasis on the analysis of data 
          from anurans, monkeys, and humans. NSL follows an object-oriented design, 
          providing higher level programming abstraction corresponding to neural 
          elements. NSL provides system development tools, such as visualization 
          capabilities and a run-time interpreter, which give the user powerful 
          tools in developing and analyzing models. NSL has been widely used throughout 
          the world for both teaching and research. </span></p>
        <p><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Current development 
          goals of NSL are to link between the multiple levels of neural modeling 
          and express the fact that neural networks can themselves be interconnected 
          in a hierarchical way, creating higher level assemblages, such as those 
          explained in the schema model in ASL - <a href="#" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('definitions.html#ASL','def','scrollbars=yes,width=800,height=300')">Abstract

        <p>Moonshot Papers</p>
        
	<p>2020-10-01</p>

<p>I wrote four papers on fundamental questions in math and science.</p>

<p>Original ideas on these topics are usually wrong,
but hope springs eternal.</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="#quantum">Quantum Mechanics</a></li>
<li><a href="#negation">Negation</a></li>
<li><a href="#diagonal">Diagonal Arguments</a></li>
<li><a href="#halting">The Halting Problem</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Do the laws of physics affect big and small things differently?</p>

<p><em>A Deterministic Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics</em>,
<a href="https://davidwyde.com/docs/wyde-quantum.pdf">4 pages</a>.</p>

<p>Quantum mechanics describes particles with wave-like behavior,
entangled particles whose measurements are correlated, and other phenomena that
are hard to explain with ideas developed before 1900.</p>

<p>Different interpretations of quantum mechanics make the same real-world predictions but tell divergent stories about why and how things happen.
Bohm’s interpretation handles the wave-particle duality well, but its explanation of entanglement
is incompatible with relativity.</p>

<p>A modified version of Bohm’s interpretation can explain entanglement as a past
interaction between two independent particles. This new theory is deterministic and resolves paradoxes such as Schrödinger’s cat and Wigner’s friend.</p>


<p>What is the opposite of a self-referential sentence?</p>

<p><em>Two Ways to Negate Self-Referential Sentences</em>, <a href="https://davidwyde.com/docs/wyde-negation.pdf">2 pages</a>.</p>

<p>One form of the liar paradox is “this sentence is false.”
Trying to evaluate this paradoxical statement leads to a type of infinite loop: if it is true it must be false, and if it is false it must be true.</p>

<p>Kurt Gödel’s incompleteness theorems are based on an undecidable sentence, roughly
“this statement is not provable.” As in the liar paradox, neither that sentence nor its negation is provable.</p>

<p>One way to bypass the liar paradox and Gödel’s incompleteness theorems is to have the negation
of a self-referential sentence refer to the new sentence (itself) rather than to the original statement.</p>

<p>With this approach, the negation of the liar sentence is “this sentence is true”, which resolves
the paradox. A similar analysis applies to Gödel’s undecidable sentence.</p>


<p>What do we learn when we try to list the elements of an infinite set?</p>

<p><em>Diagonal Arguments and Infinite Sets</em>, <a href="https://davidwyde.com/docs/wyde-diagonal.pdf">2 pages</a>.</p>

<p>A diagonal argument is a proof technique that creates a contradiction by attempting to list every element of an infinite set.</p>

<p>Georg Cantor used a diagonal argument to prove that the infinite set of real numbers is larger than
the infinite set of natural numbers. Alonzo Church used a similar proof to show that some
algorithms are impossible to implement.</p>

<p>I think Cantor’s and Church’s diagonal arguments prove only that it is
impossible to list every element of an infinite set. In each case, the argument should
end before the final step that proves the intended result.</p>


<p>Are there problems that no computer can solve?</p>

<p><em>The Halting Problem: Proofs and Demos</em>, <a href="https://davidwyde.com/docs/wyde-halting.pdf">7 pages</a>.</p>

<p>A program <code>halts(f)</code> determines if a function <code>f</code> terminates or runs
forever. <code>halts</code> must handle three cases: 1) <code>f</code> halts, 2) <code>f</code> doesn’t halt, and 3)
<code>f</code> halts if and only if a call to <code>halts(f)</code> returns false. Given these
three types of input, <code>halts</code> returns a Boolean: true if <code>f</code> halts and false
if <code>f</code> runs forever.</p>

<p>Computer science theory says that case 3) programs are contradictions that
show <code>halts</code> cannot exist. I argue that all three cases are valid, but it is
unclear how to categorize three types of programs into a true or false output
without grouping two cases together.</p>

<p>After writing this paper, I saw that <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hehner/halting.html">Eric Hehner</a> came to similar conclusions. My main contributions are to simplify the problem to 3 inputs being mapped
  to 2 outputs, analyze Alan Turing’s 1954 paper in addition to his 1936 one, and provide Python sample code.</p>

      <p><a href="https://github.com/blitz-js/superjson">SuperJSON</a> is a high-fidelity replacement to <code>JSON.stringify</code>.
It supports data types like <code>Date</code>, <code>RegExp</code>, <code>Map</code>, <code>Set</code> etc., preserves referential equality and supports circular references.
This blog post aims to compare it to alternatives and explain how it works.</p>

<!--more-->

<h3 id="whats-the-problem">What’s the Problem?</h3>

<p>JSON is the defacto standard data interchange format for web applications.
It’s human-readable, has broad tooling support and its choice on data types are compatible with most platforms.</p>

<p>As usage of JavaScript across backend and frontend became more popular, one of its value propositions have been let down by JSON: It doesn’t support data types like <code>Date</code>, <code>RegExp</code>, <code>Map</code> or <code>Set</code>, forcing developers to write cumbersome adapter logic to work around these limitations.</p>

<p>This problem became especially apparent while working on <a href="https://blitzjs.com/">Blitz.js</a>.
Blitz.js is a fullstack React framework that (amongst other things) generates your applications’ API layer at compile time.
It thus allows developers to import backend functions straight from the frontend, completely abstracting away network calls.
Here’s the problem: If we used <code>JSON.stringify</code>, our developers would be surprised because it destroyed their nice data types!
That’s where SuperJSON comes into play: It’s able to serialize any JavaScript value and thus saves our developers from quite some headache.</p>

<h2 id="other-ways-to-solve-this">Other ways to solve this</h2>

<p>SuperJSON is not the first contender, other approaches that solve this problem have existed.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Rich-Harris/devalue">devalue</a> by Rich Harris is an algorithm that encodes value into JavaScript code that creates it - it turns <code>{ foo: "bar", self: this }</code> into <code>(function(a){a.foo="bar";a.self=a;return a}({}))</code>, which can then be evaluated to get back the original value.
While it’s incredibly efficient<sup id="fnref:benchmark" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:benchmark">1</a></sup>, there isn’t any tooling support for it, and it also can’t be used to send data to the server -
what if a malicious client sent <code>while (true) { /* do nothing */ }</code>?</p>

<p>A similar approach is taken by Yahoo’s <a href="https://github.com/yahoo/serialize-javascript">Serialize JavaScript</a>, but it suffers from the same problems.</p>

<h2 id="goals-of-superjson">Goals of SuperJSON</h2>

<p>Contrary the approaches mentioned above, SuperJSON aims to …</p>

<ul>
  <li>… support any JavaScript value</li>
  <li>… be safe from remote code execution</li>
  <li>… be JSON-compatible, so existing tooling can be leveraged</li>
  <li>… support circular references</li>
  <li>… preserve referential equalities</li>
  <li>… be human-readable, so it’s easy to debug</li>
  <li>… be easy-to-understand, even if you don’t know it’s SuperJSON</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-does-superjson-solve-it">How does SuperJSON solve it?</h2>

<p>There are two parts to what we’re trying to achieve. We need to …</p>

<ol>
  <li>… transform any JavaScript value into a JSON-compatible one</li>
  <li>… be able to reverse it!</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="transforming-into-a-json-compatible-value">Transforming into a JSON-compatible value</h3>

<p>Transforming is quite easy, actually:
For already compatible ones, it’s trivial: <code>42</code> becomes <code>42</code>, <code>"lol"</code> becomes <code>"lol"</code>, <code>true</code> becomes <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> becomes <code>false</code>.</p>

<p>It’s a bit harder for values where there is no JSON counterpart: <code>Set { "foo", "bar" }</code> becomes <code>["foo", "bar"]</code>, <code>Map { 1 =&gt; 11, 2 =&gt; 22 }</code> becomes <code>[ [1, 11], [2, 22] ]</code> and <code>NaN</code> becomes <code>"NaN"</code>.</p>

<p>So given this value …</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span>
    <span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>new</span> <span>Set</span><span>([</span> <span>/a-Z/g</span> <span>]),</span>
    <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>new</span> <span>Map</span><span>([</span>
        <span>[</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>NaN</span> <span>],</span>
        <span>[</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>NaN</span> <span>]</span>
    <span>])</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>… we’ll create this json:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"a"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"/a-Z/g"</span><span>],</span><span>
    </span><span>"b"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>
        </span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"NaN"</span><span>],</span><span>
        </span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"NaN"</span><span>]</span><span>
    </span><span>]</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Easy, right? This can done recursively and fits into a couple of lines of code.</p>

<p>But we won’t be able to reverse this, right? Unless … we just take notes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"a"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"set"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"a.0"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"RegExp"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"b"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"map"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"b.0.1"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"number"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"b.1.1"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"number"</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This contains notes on any non-trivial transformations.<sup id="fnref:notes-confession" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:notes-confession">2</a></sup></p>

<p>We can then safely send both our JSON-ified value and the notes over the network.
During deserialization, we then apply the notes to recreate the original value:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>value</span><span>[</span><span>"</span><span>b</span><span>"</span><span>][</span><span>1</span><span>][</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>Number</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>[</span><span>"</span><span>b</span><span>"</span><span>][</span><span>1</span><span>][</span><span>1</span><span>])</span>
<span>value</span><span>[</span><span>"</span><span>b</span><span>"</span><span>][</span><span>0</span><span>][</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>Number</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>[</span><span>"</span><span>b</span><span>"</span><span>][</span><span>0</span><span>][</span><span>1</span><span>])</span>
<span>value</span><span>[</span><span>"</span><span>b</span><span>"</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Map</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>[</span><span>"</span><span>b</span><span>"</span><span>])</span>
<span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Not so hard, right? Now that we can preserve types, let’s see how to preserve referential equalitites.</p>

<h3 id="preserving-referential-equalities">Preserving Referential Equalities</h3>

<p>Imagine the object that’s created by the following code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>a</span><span>"</span> <span>}</span>
<span>const</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>b</span><span>"</span> <span>}</span>

<span>{</span> <span>options</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>],</span> <span>selected</span><span>:</span> <span>a</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As stated in the <a href="#goals-of-superjson">Goals</a>, we want to preserve the fact that <code>options[0] === selected</code>.
This can be done by not only taking notes on types to recreate, but also on referential equality.
For the value above, SuperJSON takes the following notes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"selected"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"options.0"</span><span>]</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can then use these notes during deserialization like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>value</span><span>[</span><span>"</span><span>options</span><span>"</span><span>][</span><span>"</span><span>0</span><span>"</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>value</span><span>[</span><span>"</span><span>selected</span><span>"</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This feature can also be used to preserve circular references.</p>

<h2 id="go-use-it">Go use it!</h2>

<p>SuperJSON is currently in beta, it should be ready for you to use in your own projects:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>npm install --save superjson
yarn add superjson
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>SuperJSON</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>superjson</span><span>"</span>

<span>const</span> <span>string</span> <span>=</span> <span>SuperJSON</span><span>.</span><span>stringify</span><span>(</span><span>yourValue</span><span>)</span>
<span>const</span> <span>profit</span> <span>=</span> <span>SuperJSON</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>string</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’re currently testing support for preserving <code>class</code> and <code>Symbol</code> instances, we’ll also work on making SuperJSON faster and smaller.</p>

<p>I’d love to hear what you think of it! Tweet at me: <a href="https://twitter.com/skn0tt">@skn0tt</a> or write a comment below.</p>

									Welcome to the second interview on 'The Observer Effect'. We are lucky to have one
									of the most influential founders/CEOs in technology and media - Daniel Ek, Founder
									and CEO of Spotify. This interview was published on 4th October, 2020.

							</em></p><p><em>Daniel does things very differently from other business leaders and was generous to go
								deep with us on his leadership style, time management, decision making, Spotify's impact
								on the world and much, much more. Enjoy!
								</em>
							</p><p><b><a href="https://sriramk.com/">Sriram Krishnan</a></b><br>
								<em><strong>Let’s start with the basics. Walk me through a typical day in the life of
										Daniel Ek.</strong></em>
							</p><p><strong>Daniel Ek</strong><br>
								So, this will sound incredibly lazy compared to some leaders. I wake up at around 6:30
								in the morning and spend some time with my kids and wife. At 7:30, I go work out. At
								8:30, I go for a walk – even in the winter. I’ve found this is often where I do my best
								thinking. At 9:30, I read for thirty minutes to an hour. Sometimes I read the news, but
								you’ll also find an ever-rotating stack of books in my office, next to my bed, on tables
								around the house. Books on history, leadership, biographies. It’s a pretty eclectic mix
								– much like my taste in music. Finally, my “work” day really starts at 10:30.
							</p><p>
								Many people make big decisions early on in the day, I make them later in the day--at
								least later in the day here in Europe. Ironically, it's not actually because I'm more
								productive then, rather because we have so many of our staff in the US, and as a result,
								I've kind of primed myself to work that way.
							</p><p>
								So the earlier part of my day is focused on coaching, one-on-ones, and planning. Then, I
								typically tackle one topic a day which takes a lot of my time. That's my big thing for
								the day. Before we go into a live team discussion on that particular topic, I invest
								time to prepare beforehand – reading and talking to members of the team who are either
								part of the decision-making process or who have insights and context. I sometimes even
								get external perspectives.
							</p><p>
								I also think about what my role is at that meeting. Sometimes I'm the approver. Other
								times, I'm supposed to come with a thoughtful perspective on whether an initiative makes
								sense or not.
							</p><p>
								I’ve found that creating this clarity of role for myself is critical. It’s something I
								challenge my direct reports to think about as they engage with their own teams. I remind
								them that all meetings are not the same. Even when we are meeting to discuss really,
								really complicated topics I always ask myself: “What am I going to do in this meeting?
								What does my involvement really need to be?”
							</p><p>
								The truth is: it's entirely contextual. I find it crucial to be upfront about everyone’s
								role in different meetings, I think this is super, super important. Often that's my
								number one thing: to make sure I know what role I'm playing.</p><p>
								<b><i>Wow, okay, there are multiple things in there ranging from how you choose to spend
										your time to how you handle meetings. To work backwards, what makes a good
										meeting in your mind?
									</i></b></p><p>A great meeting has three key elements: the desired outcome of the meeting is clear ahead
								of time; the various options are clear, ideally ahead of time; and the roles of the
								participants are clear at the time.
							</p><p>
								I often find that meetings lack one of those elements. Sometimes they lack all those,
								which is when you have to say, “This is a horrible meeting, let's end it and regroup so
								it can be more effective for everyone.”
							</p><p>
								To clarify outcomes, options, and roles ahead of time, we sometimes rely upon a preread.
								Prereads are a great way to share context so that attendees can quickly get into the
								meat of the issue and not waste time getting everyone up to speed. What I find is when
								you use a tool like a Google Doc, you can take in a great deal of information by reading
								comments, assessing options, and understanding how opinions have evolved over time. With
								this uniform background and context, attendees can focus on discussing the matter at
								hand versus getting on the same page. When the latter happens, the meeting becomes an
								incredible waste of time.
							</p><p>
								I think that's the single largest source of optimization for a company: the makeup of
								their meetings. To be clear, it's not about fewer meetings because meetings serve a
								purpose. Rather, it’s key to improve the meetings, themselves. A lot of my efforts focus
								on teaching people this framework. Ironically, I find that most people are just
								challenged by that stuff.
							</p><p>
								Candidly, that’s my role as leader: to coach others on how best to make use of their
								limited time. Not only is time the most precious resource the company has, it’s also the
								most precious resource they have! It’s crucial that they approach the use of their time
								with a holistic perspective. By way of example, I had a recent call with one of my
								directors who had not taken a vacation in six months. Our conversation delved into why
								this person thought that they could not be away for two weeks, and me arguing for why
								the person had to take two weeks to recharge!
							</p><p>
								There is never enough time – for work, for family and friends – and it takes work to
								make the best use of it. It's all about fostering a holistic perspective in life.

							</p><p>
								<b><i>
										That’s fascinating. Let’s turn to your team.

										Your direct reports are highly accomplished people; what are the common mistakes
										you see executives at that level make when it comes to personal time management?
									</i>
							</b></p><div>
							<div><p>
								I don’t think most executives dedicate enough time to thinking. They spend too much time
								in meetings. By the way, I will say as a caveat, I do know people who are incredibly
								organized and succeed with a lot of “do time.” Shishir Mehrotra [Co-founder and CEO of
								Coda] is a great example. If you've seen the docs on how he organizes his time...
								</p><p>

								<b><i>Oh yeah, he has a lot of very well-organized docs! [laughs]</i></b></p></div><p>
								He is a source of inspiration. For a while, I tried to mimic his style because I was so
								impressed with his thinking behind it. But in the end, it just wasn’t for me. It
								actually drove me nuts. <i>[Sriram laughs]</i>
								But I respect him. I would say he's a highly effective executive. His system works for
								him. It's not one size fits all. Some of my direct reports thrive on lots of meetings.
								But, in general, I would say the largest mistake is that they conflate meetings with
								productivity. Often fewer meetings and better decisions drive the business forward.

							</p>
							<h2 id="opencalendar"><b>On Creating an Open Calendar</b></h2>
							<p>


								<b><i>This dovetails nicely with something that fascinates many of your colleagues: how
										do you have so much open time on your calendar?

										This drastically differs from your typical “successful CEO” who is booked from
										8:30am to 6pm. Walk us through your calendar and how you manage to create this
										open space.
									</i></b>

							</p>

							<p>

								My friends know me well! I do keep a lot of open time. I understand this comes from a
								place of privilege and I’m very lucky to have this flexibility.
							</p>
							<p>

								I feel like synchronous time is very costly; asynchronous time is better. I know there
								are some leaders who prefer to have all executive decisions travel through them. But
								then, you have to wait until the leader has availability to review things. Sometimes you
								run into delays in that process.
							</p>
							<p>
								I typically don't have more than really three or four meetings per day. There are
								exceptions; when I travel, I book in a lot more and I don't keep to my normal schedule.
								That said, most of the time it's three or four meetings a day.

							</p>
							<p>
								My way is to plan long term and do so ahead of time so that people better understand the
								direction in which they're going. You have to be incredibly crisp and clear when doing
								that. For instance, right now we're finalizing our five year plans and long range
								planning. These are actual, real targets fueled by real insights. They are made up of
								lots of super-detailed quarterly and annual goals. I don’t spend much time on the
								quarterly goals and instead focus on our so-called “big rocks.”
							</p>


							<h2 id="bets"><b>On Company Bets</b></h2>
							<p>
								At Spotify, we have something called “Company Bets.” These are large-scale initiatives
								that we believe will have a significant impact on the business within a relatively short
								period of time. I find that these bets are a much better use of my time. Our Company
								Bets typically update every six months, so I'm not needed that much in between. This
								way, I can constantly be thinking: “Where are we headed in the next six months?” Right
								now, I am thinking more about H2 2021. From a timeline perspective, that's the earliest
								place where I focus most of my time.
							</p>
							<p>
								It’s also my role to think far beyond that. For instance, I’m immersing myself in our
								2025 plans. I trust my team to manage the day-to-day, shorter-term initiatives and
								iterate as needed based on data and insights. They’re the best at that and I appreciate
								that this then frees me up to think about the long term.
							</p>

Upon investigating further, we realized that, because of the way we had implemented Autotrack when it launched in August 2016, this could happen in other scenarios where browser plugins (such as the 1Password password manager) and website frameworks place sensitive data into form element attributes.</em></p><p>In fact it looks like RudderStack's implementation of autotrack is based on <a href="https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-js/blob/a369b4ce7312713140ceead88217b364c68a1825/src/autotrack.js">Mixpanel's buggy autotrack implementation</a>.</p><p>When Mixpanel discovered the issue, they <a href="https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-js/commit/b1d2a38e7cab22df9d95a531c62ef7af1c06af1d#diff-5328f5c4505ca0b5bf48cff18d6c85a8L60-L66">put safeguards in place</a> <a href="https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-js/commit/b1d2a38e7cab22df9d95a531c62ef7af1c06af1d#diff-5328f5c4505ca0b5bf48cff18d6c85a8R47">to prevent c</a><a href="https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-js/commit/b1d2a38e7cab22df9d95a531c62ef7af1c06af1d">apturing attrib</a><a href="https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-js/commit/b1d2a38e7cab22df9d95a531c62ef7af1c06af1d#diff-5328f5c4505ca0b5bf48cff18d6c85a8L60-L66">utes</a> <a href="https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-js/commit/b1d2a38e7cab22df9d95a531c62ef7af1c06af1d">from input fi</a><a href="https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-js/commit/b1d2a38e7cab22df9d95a531c62ef7af1c06af1d#diff-5328f5c4505ca0b5bf48cff18d6c85a8L60-L66">elds</a>. Specifically they added a function shouldTrackElement that prevents the collection of attributes from input fields:</p><p>{% c-block language="js" %}<br>// don't send data from inputs or similar elements since there will always be<br>// a risk of clientside javascript placing sensitive data in attributes<br>if (<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;isTag(el, 'input') ||<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;isTag(el, 'select') ||<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;isTag(el, 'textarea') ||<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;el.getAttribute('contenteditable') === 'true'<br>) {<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;return false;<br>}<br>{% c-block-end %}<br>When RudderStack based their code off of Mixpanel's library, they decided not to include this code, even though it explicitly warns what can happen. After I notified RudderStack of the issue, <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-sdk-js/commit/e94fb28d04f0d0d6544c5da6eef602a0951047bd">they put back the safeguards Mixpanel had put in place</a>.</p><p>Personally, I don't think the safeguards are enough. The safeguards only prevent the capture of attributes from input elements. Attributes on all other elements will still be captured. Given that attributes can hold any internal program state, there's no reason sensitive information would be limited to only input elements. After writing their fix, RudderStack asked me to review it. I told them I did not think their fix was enough, but I have yet to hear back from them.</p><p>Other companies do provide autotrack functionality, but are more careful about not collecting data attributes. Notably:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052608053-Using-Element-Attributes-in-Search-Page-Analytics-Beta-">Fullstory allows only a whitelist of attributes.</a></li><li><a href="https://support.pendo.io/hc/en-us/articles/360031861612-HTML-Attributes">Pendo requires you to whitelist attributes you want to collect.</a></li><li>Freshpaint does not collect data attributes.</li></ul><p>Because these companies only collect a specific set of data attributes, they don't have to worry about accidentally collecting passwords.</p></div></div>]]>

<h3 id="orleans-is-a-cross-platform-framework-for-building-robust-scalable-distributed-applications">Orleans is a cross-platform framework for building robust, scalable distributed applications</h3>
<p>Orleans builds on the developer productivity of .NET and brings it to the world of distributed applications, such as cloud services. Orleans scales from a single on-premises server to globally distributed, highly-available applications in the cloud.</p>
<p>Orleans takes familiar concepts like objects, interfaces, async/await, and try/catch and extends them to multi-server environments. As such, it helps developers experienced with single-server applications transition to building resilient, scalable cloud services and other distributed applications. For this reason, Orleans has often been referred to as "Distributed .NET".</p>
<p>It was created by <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/projects/orleans/">Microsoft Research</a> and introduced the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=210931">Virtual Actor Model</a> as a novel approach to building a new generation of distributed systems for the Cloud era. The core contribution of Orleans is its programming model which tames the complexity inherent to highly-parallel distributed systems without restricting capabilities or imposing onerous constraints on the developer.</p>

                <p>A few months ago I made the decision to purchase an already operating Software as a Service (SaaS) business. <a href="https://myclientspot.com/">MyClientSpot</a> offers project, client, contractor, and time management software as a service.</p>
<p>This was a pretty big decision for me. Like a lot of developers, I’ve always been of the opinion “Why purchase something that I can easily build?” I’ve had limited success building products from the ground up before and decided to try something different this time by starting with an existing product that had a solid base of loyal customers.  My hope is that the customers will be able to inform product development and speed the discovery processes.</p>

<p>I blame Patrick McKenzie for documenting how he’s sold multiple SaaS businesses for putting the idea in my head.  You can read his excellent account from the seller side <a href="https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/selling_software_business">here</a>.
I plan on documenting the other side of the sales transaction and where I take it from here.</p>
<p>As a full-stack senior web developer/consultant, I’ve worked on legacy SaaS products many times in the past.  I usually parachute in, do some poking around to understand the system then either fix a bad bug or implement a feature that they lack lack the skills and/or time to complete internally.</p>
<p>Something I’ve learned is that there are thousands (millions?) of small applications out there, limping along on shared hosting and making a few thousand dollars a month.  Most haven’t been updated in years and the owner is usually a non-tech person who enjoys the stable revenue but doesn’t have the ability to take the product to the next level.</p>
<p>Why not find one of those businesses that still have a solid customer base, update it’s tech a bit, and grow the user count?  Nothing I haven’t done before but this time I’d be the beneficiary of the growth.  Of course I’d be forgoing the fat consulting check that usually goes along with the job, but hopefully it’ll pay off as the company grows.</p>
<p>I subscribed to the buyers listing at <a href="https://feinternational.com/">FE International</a> and after a few months found a  likely listing.  After signing a non-disclosure agreement they sent me a slim prospectus on “MyClientSpot”.  The company seemed like a cross between project and outsourcing management, with a few weird database type features thrown into the mixture.</p>
<p>The website had that distinct mid-2000’s look and was still using tables for it’s page layouts.  If I was approaching this a consultant, I would have been immediately drafting a “This is a problem and here’s how I can help” proposal with a quote attached, because there was no way it could be signing up many trials let alone converting them to paid accounts.</p>
<p>After discussing it with my team, we were all in agreement that there was potential for this software and made an offer a bit below the listing price. After a little haggling back and forth, we finally came to an agreement to start the purchase process.  In order for our proposal to be more attractive we offered to close very quickly in a matter of weeks.</p>
<p>We then had a few weeks to perform due diligence on the website but were limited here by the lack of technical knowledge by the sellers.  They’d never had to really dig into the operations and had outsourced the support.</p>
<p>Major red flags we found were:</p>
<ul>
<li>There weren’t any analytics running on the website, so no real way to guess at how much traffic the site was getting because the seller also lacked access to the log files.</li>
<li>There was very little ability to allow us to view the source code.  We finally managed to view that via FTP from the (very outdated) cPanel and viewed enough to determine that it was running php with a early version of the codeigniter framework.  Codeigniter was a big plus; that indicated that the code probably had some structure and wasn’t your typical mid-2000’s Php ugly mess.</li>
<li>Email for the site was self hosted on the server and completely overwhelmed with spam.</li>
<li>The non-application web pages were hosted on an outdated and insecure wordpress.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above didn’t deter me because it was all items that I would be working on changing as soon as we took possession.  Some of the issues were potentially very serious, and there wasn’t much time to waste with updates.  It wouldn’t take much for the site to suffer significant downtime which would cause the existing customers to evaporate, leaving the site worthless and our money down the drain.</p>
<p>The good news was the prospectus showed it had a cadre of very stable core customers which had not changed substantially in the past year, and several that had been customers for a few years. To us that said the existing customers must be very satisfied, the challenge would be to attract new ones.</p>
<p>We gave the go-head to FE that we’d like to close the deal and this is where Patrick’s recommendation to “always use a broker” was proven completely correct.  FE made sure that all the documents were in order and had a step-by-step procedure that listed exactly what would be transferred and the steps to do so. This made the transfer of sale and monies go very smoothly. And we had them to go to for advice when there were things we did not quite understand.</p>
<p>Despite that we still managed to encounter a few small hiccups.</p>
<ul>
<li>Credit card processing was with Authorize.net and they required a new merchant account be setup.  Some of the customers were also using American Express for billing and that required an entirely different merchant account to be established.  This took a credit check, validation, and almost 30 days to accomplish which was much longer than we expected.  The seller went above and beyond though and left his merchant account in place and transferred the funds back to us.</li>
<li>We were slow on sending a welcome email out to the customers.  A few noticed that the billing name on their credit cards statement had changed and didn’t know what was going on.  In our defense the invoicing, credit card processing and system customer list did not match.  It took a substantial amount of investigation to even figure out who all of our currently active customers were.</li>
<li>Rackspace is a strange company.  They refuse to transfer service without sending multiple signed and scanned forms.  We finally just gave up on transferring and took over the original account.  We later learned that they ALSO don’t allow renaming accounts without sending more PDFs around.  Come on guys, it’s just a $10/month account that stores a few files.</li>
</ul>
<p>After closing, I immediately went around changing all the passwords, setup hourly backups, put analytics on the website so we could discover how it was actually being used, and downloaded a copy of the website source code for in-depth evaluation.</p>
<p>We sent out an email to all the current users introducing ourselves and requesting feedback on what they’d like to see improved.  We got several fantastic responses that we are currently prioritizing into a proper product road-map. And most importantly, we started using the service for ourselves, not only does this help us to understand the processes, keep our tasks inline, but also gives us a good idea of future improvements also.</p>
<p>Lessons learned from the process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you completely understand how the billing process works.  Even though we were focused on the financials we didn’t pay attention to the actual invoicing process to understand what was needed for a smoother transfer of receivables.</li>
<li>Use a broker if at all possible!  I shudder to think of what would have went wrong if we’d tried to do this as a private sale without FE’s processes in place, as well as their guidance.</li>
<li>Get a good contact list of current active customers for efficient and transparent communication with them.  Since your customer base is you bread and butter, keep them in the loop so they stick with you!</li>
</ul>
<p>Would we do it again? Absolutely! We’ve been running <a href="https://myclientspot.com/">MyClientSpot</a> for several months now and just completed an update to modernized the user-interface.</p>
<p>I’ll do a further write-up of the updates that’ve been completed next month and how things are progressing.  Want to read about Mysql to Postgresql?  Introducing tests to a code base that utterly lacks them? Augmenting Php with graphql? Then tune in next time to hear more about these transactions.</p>

<p>A newly discovered phishing campaign makes the recipient solve captchas in an effort to both add some legitimacy to itself and evade detection systems.</p>



<p>Typically, captchas are a puzzle or a challenge that humans are made to solve to prove to a web server they are not an automated system (“robot”) accessing the server.</p>



<p>Use of captchas helps distinguish legitimate (human-initiated) traffic from automated bot traffic as the latter can have nefarious motives. </p>



<p>Captchas, therefore, help prevent security attacks – such as rogue pentesting bots by just fuzzing a website and Denial of Service (DoS).</p>



<p>But, what good would a phishing page achieve from making its victims solve captchas?</p>



<h2>Evades automated security systems</h2>



<p>Not only does the phishing campaign employ captchas to appear more legitimate to its recipients, but addition of captchas means <em>bots</em> can’t access the page.</p>



<p>While the term “bot” may have a negative connotation in this context, these <em>also</em> <em>include</em> automated security research tools looking to detect and deter such phishing campaigns.</p>



<p>Menlo Security analyzed such a phishing campaign that comprised a fake Microsoft Office 365 page.</p>



<p>Vinay Pidathala, Director of Security Research at Menlo Security explained in a <a href="https://www.menlosecurity.com/blog/menlo-threat-labs-uncovers-a-phishing-attack-using-captchas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog</a> post:</p>



<p>“To defeat automated crawling systems and ensure that a human is interacting with the page, the attackers put the credential phishing page behind layers of visual captchas, so the user would have to click the right set of images to ensure that they are not a bot,” providing screenshots.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.menlosecurity.com/hs-fs/hubfs/images/blog/iSOC_Blog/iSOC_Figure3.png?width=600&amp;name=iSOC_Figure3.png" alt="iSOC_Figure3" data-src="https://www.menlosecurity.com/hs-fs/hubfs/images/blog/iSOC_Blog/iSOC_Figure3.png?width=600&amp;name=iSOC_Figure3.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption>Image: Google reCaptcha integrated with phishing spam</figcaption></figure>



<p><br>“In addition to the first check, the attackers have designed two other captchas, in case the first one gets defeated by automated systems,” continued Pidathala.</p>



<p>Only after two different captchas are successfully solved by the victim, does the page redirect them to a final landing page.</p>



<p>This landing page is a Microsoft Office 365 login page-lookalike which tries to phish user’s credentials.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.menlosecurity.com/hs-fs/hubfs/images/blog/iSOC_Blog/iSOC_Figure4.png?width=600&amp;name=iSOC_Figure4.png" alt="iSOC_Figure4" data-src="https://www.menlosecurity.com/hs-fs/hubfs/images/blog/iSOC_Blog/iSOC_Figure4.png?width=600&amp;name=iSOC_Figure4.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption>Image: Office 365 phishing page loads after captcha challenges are solved</figcaption></figure>



<p>A phishing campaign such as this one may appear simple but it is in fact crafted with a very clever purpose in mind.</p>



<p>The addition of widely recognized Google reCaptcha used by many legitimate websites may trick a novice user into believing the authenticity of the phishing page.</p>



<p>But further, email gateways and web proxies that may have otherwise intercepted and blocked the final landing page are now rendered moot. </p>



<p>Because, for them to be able to analyze this page they need to solve the captcha, to prove they are <em>human.</em> The irony behind this setup is tough to miss.</p>



<p>As attackers constantly evolve their tactics when it comes to phishing campaigns, unsolved challenges keep growing for enterprise security customers and IT professionals alike.</p>



<p>There’s the challenge to support a large scale infrastructure that works flawlessly and delivers the business value that it’s designed for, yet there is an expectation to battle these kinds of novel phishing attacks from infiltrating corporate networks.</p>



<p>Staying up to date with the latest intel on cyberattacks, and being on the lookout for security tools equipped with this constantly evolving information are great ways to tackle these challenges.</p>

<p>As a Data Scientist you will be spending a large chunk of your time doing repetitive work across projects. You get a new data set and you run the same boilerplate code for your analysis: Import data, check for missing values, distribution check, cleansing, yada yada …</p>

<p>I know, datasets are very different yet I still see how often times the very same steps are repeated blindly in notebooks over and over again. Despite common software engineering principles telling us to not repeat ourselves, we still do it. I started noticing this pattern in my own work and got frustrated. Is there a way to break this recurring cycle?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Over and over and over and over, like a monkey with a miniature cymbal, the joy of repetition really is in you.  <em>Over and Over - Hot Chip</em></p>

<p>My tip: build your personal library of frequently needed analysis helper functions to make your life easier. See yourself as data science practitioner and master your tools over time. Rather than having them scrambled around all over your workbench, you need a central place to store them. That is your personal toolkit. It is different for everybody but you will recognize its importance and appreciate it the more you will use it. Upgrade and sharpen your knives regularly. It is your toolkit.</p>

<p>In this post I will show you some good practices around Python packaging with a focus on Data Science applications. In detail, we are going to:</p>

<ul>
<li>create a package of frequently used functions,</li>
<li>test our code with unit-tests,</li>
<li>and finally distribute through git.<br></li>
</ul>



<p>In order to get started, think about the steps that you regularly do when starting a new data project (e.g. at school, work or personal).</p>

<p>Here is a list of recurring tasks I can think of right from the top of my head:</p>

<ul>
<li>Analysis

<ul>
<li>Plot distributions for all columns/features</li>
<li>Outlier detection for various datatypes (categoric, numeric, timestamps etc.)</li>
<li>Missing values detection and handling</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Database and File IO

<ul>
<li>Write helper functions for easier access data stores specific to your work. It might be the ugly ERP that you are using at your BigCorp™️ or just plain database connectors. Think of useful abstractions to read/write to these.<br></li>
<li>Writing files to S3 and other file stores.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Machine Learning

<ul>
<li>Feature creation</li>
<li>Train-Test splits beyond sklearn</li>
<li>Model Validation
<br></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Many posts have been written about structuring Python packages, I can warmly recommend the following for more in-depth discussions on this topic:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://godatadriven.com/blog/a-practical-guide-to-using-setup-py/">A Practical Guide to Using Setup.py - GoDataDriven</a></li>

<li><a href="https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/">Packaging Python Projects — Python Packaging User Guide</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Obviously your Data Science toolkit should be tailored to your own work and needs. So be selfish and name it after yourself … or come up with a cool sounding name, how about <a href="https://blog.reedsy.com/character-name-generator/">Swahili character names</a>?</p>

<p>For the example project in this post, we are going to start with a simple package called <code>frnz-sample</code>, named after yours truly.</p>

<p>Find a link to the Github repository <a href="https://github.com/alfranz/frnz-sample">here</a> to have a look at the exact structure.</p>

<p>The project looks something like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">frnz-sample
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── frnz
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── __init__.py
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── analytics.py
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── data.py
├── setup.py
└── tests
    └── test_analytics.py</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>frnz</code>directory contains two core modules, the first one <code>analytics.py</code></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="analytics.py"><span>import</span> pandas <span>as</span> pd
<span>from</span> typing <span>import</span> Dict

<span>def</span> count_missing(dataframe: pd.DataFrame) -&gt; Dict[<span>str</span>, <span>int</span>]:
    <span>return</span> <span>dict</span>(dataframe.isna().sum())</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>count_missing</code> function will return the number of missing values for every column in the supplied DataFrame. This is only one sample for a  convenience function that will be part of your toolkit. Add more over time!</p>

<h2 id="shipping-toy-data">Shipping toy-data 🕹</h2>

<p>Another key aspect of the Data Science toolkit is of course data! This is useful for two primary reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>use it as a starting place for analysis tasks or data pipelines,</li>
<li>Most importantly: Use them to unit-test your core functions. More on that later.</li>
</ul>

<p>Shipping little toy-dataset with your package avoids external API calls to download (potentially) larger datasets.  You can find similar dataset loading utilities within other packages such as <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html">scikit-learn</a>.</p>

<p>Keep in mind the main functionalities you want to cover by your code and design your toy-data accordingly. Typos, missing data and outliers are only some of the things you will encounter in your work.</p>

<p>In our case, I created a small Pandas DataFrame with containing city names that can be used for other analysis functions. Even though we don’t have many rows here, we can potentially test a few important things:</p>

<ul>
<li>(fuzzy) duplicates

<ul>
<li>there are two “Cape Towns” in this dataset, how do we find the <em>real</em> one?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>outliers

<ul>
<li>numerical: Mumbai is quite populated but really by that much?</li>
<li>categorical: Sydney is in Australia but the 3 digit country code deviates from the majority used 2 digit country ISO codes shown. How do we find these anomalies programmatically?</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>missing values</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="data.py"><span>import</span> pandas <span>as</span> pd

cities = pd.DataFrame(
data={
    <span>"city"</span>: [
        <span>"Berlin"</span>,
        <span>"Vienna"</span>,
        <span>"Montreal"</span>,
        <span>"Mumbai"</span>,
        <span>"cape-town"</span>,
        <span>"Cape Town"</span>,
        <span>"Sydney"</span>,
    ],
    <span>"country"</span>: [<span>"DE"</span>, <span>"AT"</span>, <span>"CA"</span>, <span>"IN"</span>, pd.NA, <span>"ZA"</span>, <span>"AUS"</span>],
    <span>"population"</span>: [<span>3750000</span>, <span>1900000</span>, <span>1780000</span>, <span>184100000</span>, <span>430000</span>, <span>440000</span>, pd.NA],
}
)</code></pre></div></li>
</ul>

<p>You have finished your first core functions? Time for testing!</p>



<p>Unit-testing our code ensures that it performs as expected. Especially when using Jupyter notebooks and using ad-hoc code, we often run into risks of using untested functions. This is fine for quick analysis but if those functions are repeatedly used, they should become part of your library. And that means writing tests.</p>

<p>Here is an example for a unit-test for our <code>count_missing</code> function from the <code>analytics</code> module.  I will use the <code>pytest</code> framework for this as it provides the simplest way to get started with testing in Python.</p>

<p>In a folder called <code>tests</code>, create the following file <code>test_analytics.py</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> frnz.data <span>import</span> cities
<span>from</span> frnz.analytics <span>import</span> count_missing
<span>import</span> pytest


<span>def</span> test_counting_nas_return_correct_count():
    result = count_missing(cities)
    expected = {<span>"city"</span>: <span>0</span>, <span>"country"</span>: <span>1</span>, <span>"population"</span>: <span>1</span>}
    <span>assert</span> <span>len</span>(result) == <span>len</span>(expected)
    <span>assert</span> result[<span>"country"</span>] == expected[<span>"country"</span>]</code></pre></div>
<p>First, we have to import all objects that we need for that specific test.
In our case, this test will also import the sample DataFrame that we created earlier.</p>

<p>The structure of a test file is quite simple: you create a new function that will test a specific behavior of your code by comparing an expected outcome with the actual result. In this case, we will test the length and result of the function call to <code>count_missing</code> with our sample <code>cities</code>dataframe. Because we already know how many missing values each column of our sample data contains, we can explicitly create a dictionary of expected results in the test.</p>

<p>By calling <code>assert</code> for both expected and actual results, we specify the expected equality and thus make sure the function works correctly.</p>

<p>When we are testing our code, we should just be able to call the
<code>pytest</code> command from the CLI in the root of our package. This will start the test-runner and automatically find the unit test we just wrote. Make sure to add the <code>test_</code> prefix to the name of your Python files containing your tests. This is essentially the cue for pytest to pick up that file as a unit-test.
Pytest will run your tests and output a message whether they have failed or passed.</p>

<h2 id="distribute-through-github">Distribute through Github</h2>

<p>The great thing about using git for version control is that you can directly <code>pip install</code>  your package from Github (without publishing to PyPI). Just use:</p>

<p><code>pip install -e git+https://github.com/alfranz/frnz-sample.git@master#egg=frnz</code></p>

<p>and/or specify it as part of a <code>requirements.txt</code> in your project like:</p>
<div><pre>frnz @ git+https://github.com/alfranz/frnz-sample.git@master#egg=frnz</pre></div>
<h2 id="using-the-package-in-the-wild">Using the package in the wild 💪</h2>

<p>Now you should be able to simply install your new package through <code>pip install</code> and call the your functions like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> frnz

df = frnz.data.cities

<span>print</span>(frnz.analytics.count_missing(df))</code></pre></div>
<p>Awesome, your package should now be working. You are now ready to not repeat yourself as frequently as before and super-charge your analytics workflows.</p>

<h2 id="more-to-come">More to come!</h2>

<p>This is the first post on the Data Science toolkit series. The next posts will go into more detail regarding CI/CD, the use of Docker containers and some additional things I have found useful in my work.</p>

<p>Did you enjoy this post? I would love to hear your feedback. What kind of functions did you add to your toolkit? <a href="https://twitter.com/frnzio">Let me know!</a></p>

      A step by step instruction for compiling a Java program into Android executable and using ADB to run it.

<p>When you want to create a system / commandline tool for Android, you have to write it in C(++)… or do you?</p>

<p><strong>TLDR;</strong> here’s the final <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/run-java-app-android/helloworld.zip">proof of concept</a>.</p>

<p>Sticking with Java would have the benefit of avoiding all of the native ABI hassle and also being able to call into the Android runtime. So how do we do that?</p>

<h2 id="a-not-so-simple-hello-world-program">A (not so) simple Hello World program</h2>

<p>Let’s start with the Java program we want to run.

		<span>}</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>

<h2 id="setting-up-the-working-directory">Setting up the working directory</h2>

<p>We will have to <strong>manually</strong> run several commandline tools in the next step, assuming the following <strong>final</strong> directory structure:
</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">.
├── android-sdk-linux
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── build-tools
│&nbsp;&nbsp;     └── <span>23</span>.0.2
│&nbsp;&nbsp;         └── dx
├── bin
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── com
│&nbsp;&nbsp;     └── example
│&nbsp;&nbsp;         └── HelloWorld.class
├── lib
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── commons-cli-1.3.1.jar
├── src
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── com
│&nbsp;&nbsp;     └── example
│&nbsp;&nbsp;         └── HelloWorld.java
├── helloworld.jar
└── helloworld.sh</code></pre></div>

<p>Start by creating an empty directory in a convenient place. Download and unpack the following items there:</p>

<ul>
<li>Android SDK (either via <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio">Android Studio</a> or the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/sdkmanager">SDK Manager</a>). <strong>NOTE:</strong> If you are an Android developer, you’ll have the Android SDK already installed. In that case, you don’t actually need to copy it to the working directory as long as you know the path to the <code>dx</code> tool.</li>
<li>Apache Commons CLI library v1.3.1</li>
</ul>

<p>Afterwards copy&amp;paste the HelloWorld code from above into the source folder.</p>

<h2 id="compiling-and-dexing-the-java-class">Compiling and dexing the Java class</h2>

<p>Next step is to compile the java class (keep in mind that Android is stuck with Java 7 - bytecode for later versions won’t work). In case you are not used to doing this outside of an IDE, here’s the command:
</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">javac -source <span>1</span>.7 -target <span>1</span>.7 -d bin -cp lib/commons-cli-1.3.1.jar src/com/example/HelloWorld.java</code></pre></div>

<p>Make sure the program compiled properly:
</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">java -cp lib/commons-cli-1.3.1.jar:bin com.example.HelloWorld -h
usage: Hello world
 -h   Print help
 -v   Print version</code></pre></div>

<p>Android cannot run Java class files directly. They have to be converted to Dalvik’s DEX format first (yes, even if you using ART):
</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">./android-sdk-linux/build-tools/23.0.2/dx --output<span>=</span>helloworld.jar --dex ./bin lib/commons-cli-1.3.1.jar</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Android Build Tools v28.0.2 and later contain a <code>dx</code> upgrade, called <code>d8</code>. The <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/d8">d8 tool</a> can process Java 8 class files. I’ll stick with <code>dx</code> for backwards compatibility reasons here.</p>

<h2 id="creating-the-startup-shellscript">Creating the startup shellscript</h2>

<p>Android does not have a (normal) JRE, so JAR files cannot be started the same way as on a PC. You need a shellscript wrapper to do this. Copy&amp;paste the one below to the workspace.
</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">base<span>=</span>/data/local/tmp/helloworld
export CLASSPATH<span>=</span>$base/helloworld.jar
export ANDROID_DATA<span>=</span>$base
mkdir -p $base/dalvik-cache
exec app_process $base com.example.HelloWorld <span>"</span>$@<span>"</span></code></pre></div>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> DEX files can also be started directly using the <code>dalvikvm</code> command, but going through <code>app_process</code> gives us a pre-warmed VM from the Zygote process (it is also the method employed by framework commands like <code>pm</code> and <code>am</code>).</p>

<h2 id="installing-and-running-the-non-app">Installing and running the (non-) app</h2>

<p>Time to push everything to the device:
</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">adb shell mkdir -p /data/local/tmp/helloworld
adb push helloworld.jar /data/local/tmp/helloworld
adb push helloworld.sh /data/local/tmp/helloworld
adb shell chmod <span>777</span> /data/local/tmp/helloworld/helloworld.sh</code></pre></div>

<p>Moment of truth (fingers crossed):
</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">adb shell /data/local/tmp/helloworld/helloworld.sh -v
Hello World <span>(</span>armv7l<span>)</span> v0.1</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Since nothing was installed into the system, getting rid of the program is simply done by deleting the directory again.</p>

<h2 id="it-works-but-how-do-i-get-a-context">It works, but how do I get a Context?!</h2>

<p>You don’t!</p>

<p>Contexts represent an environment that is associated with an app (which we explicitly did not build) and are also device dependant. They can only be created by the ActivityThread class (a hidden system class that you cannot instantiate). If you want to interact with the Android runtime, you have to talk to the system services directly through their Binder interfaces. But that’s a topic for another article.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hook="post-description"><article><div><div data-rce-version="7.19.2"><div dir="ltr"><div><p id="viewer-dnutn">Here at Sleuth, we live in Zoom, and have accumulated a list of tips to make video meetings better. I'm going to talk about three quick tips to go from a muddled dungeon dweller to a clear, engaging talking head, all without spending a dime. If you want even more,</p><p id="viewer-6c0ca">the above video shows you 9 <em>more</em> tips, including one advanced (but still completely free) tip to turn a video call into a real-time broadcast experience.</p><p id="viewer-aolmv">Remote Zoom or WebEx calls used to be a bit of a novelty but now they are simply how we do business. The better you look and sound on a video call, the more professional and confident your boss and colleagues will perceive you. To improve your video meetings, you need to look at three areas: sound, framing, and lighting.</p><p id="viewer-b3at8"><strong>Tip 1 - Move the microphone closer</strong></p><p id="viewer-dgia5">Sound is the most important factor in the success of your video meeting, because if they can't hear you, you simply can't communicate anything, no matter how great the picture quality. The biggest mistake people make here is to use their laptop mic, multiple feet away from their mouth, where all the noise of the room is picked up at similar volumes as their voice. Worse, they don't use a headphone, so the pic starts picking up the audio of the very meeting they are in.</p><p id="viewer-4g5o9">The fix here is simple - put the mic closer to your mouth. If the mic can pick up your voice louder than the ambient noises, your audio quality will immediately clean up and people will be able to hear you again. If you have an extra set of headphones with a mic, use that, or if you only have your laptop, put it closer to your face.</p><p id="viewer-1m7s8"><strong>Tip 2 - Position the camera at eye level</strong></p><div id="viewer-4cujo"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.sleuth.io/post/3-9-quick-video-meeting-tips-we-use-every-day" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e447f2_5f0a591b63fb4aa8b4c1f4bd67ce93f7~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e447f2_5f0a591b63fb4aa8b4c1f4bd67ce93f7~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-8g28j">Framing is how the camera captures you and your surroundings. You want frame yourself such that the focus is on you and not the distractions in the background. To get the best picture of you, you need to position the camera at eye level.  If you have the laptop on your, well, lap, the camera will be looking up your nose with a lovely view of that double chin that you normally don't have, but you do now.</p><p id="viewer-82fte">Another simple fix - set the laptop on a shelf, stand, or even a few books to raise the camera up to eye level. This will make your face look much better, draw the attention to your eyes, and be more engaging for your audience.</p><p id="viewer-amdcd"><strong>Tip 3 - Light you more than your background</strong></p><div id="viewer-fqan2"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.sleuth.io/post/3-9-quick-video-meeting-tips-we-use-every-day" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e447f2_f5cdd0823acf4767bb790ce8fe72a481~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e447f2_f5cdd0823acf4767bb790ce8fe72a481~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-a5pv0">Lighting is often forgotten about when doing a video call, but the wrong lighting will drown your image, draw unflattering shadows on your face, or distract your audience with what's behind you.</p><p id="viewer-16gbj">First, avoid big light sources behind you such as a window or doorway. These force the camera to try to adjust the exposure to the light, making your face dark and brooding. Second, avoid overhead lights as it casts unflattering shadows on your face, particularly the nose onto the mouth region. Second, light your face from the front with a lamp or sunlight so that your face can be clearly seen.</p><p id="viewer-cq5dn">You can dramatically improve your video meetings without spending a lot of time or money. I've found these tips useful because the better you look over video, the more professional and confidence you come across, giving you that little leg up. For more tips and to see them in action, check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeoG1z4TZlo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>12 quick video meeting tips to try right now video</u></a>.</p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

<span>Mon Oct 5, 2020</span></h4></p></div></div><div id="features"><div><p><h4>Crouching T2, Hidden Danger
<span>Mon Oct 5, 2020</span></h4><hr><br></p><p><strong>Let’s talk about that thing nobody’s talking about.
Let’s talk about a vulnerability that’s exposing 2018-2020 Macs while most are declining to act nor report about the matter.
Oh, and did I mention it’s unpatchable?</strong></p><p><strong>Buckle up buckaroo, we’re in for a wild ride.</strong></p><p>Skip to <a href="#security-issues">#security-issues</a> for the technical mumbo-jumbo.</p><h2 id="preface">Preface</h2><h3 id="attribution">Attribution</h3><p>The following post is an industry analysis of the code and research performed by <a href="https://twitter.com/axi0mx/">twitter.com/axi0mx</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/h0m3us3r/">twitter.com/h0m3us3r</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/aunali1/">twitter.com/aunali1</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mcmrarm/">twitter.com/mcmrarm</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/su_rickmark/">twitter.com/su_rickmark</a> who poured endless hours of work into this, allowing companies and users to understand their risks concerning this issue.</p><h3 id="intel-vs-silicon">Intel vs Silicon</h3><p>This blog post only applies to macOS systems with an Intel processor and the embedded T2 security chip.
Apple silicon systems will run completely on a set of Apple-designed ARM processors and mighth have a different topology, e.g. based on the A12.
Since the A12 chip seems to have fixed this issue (to be confirmed), it’s highly likely the new Apple Silicon machines will not be vulnerable.
And while the new upcoming Intel Macs at the end of year will probably receive a new hardware revision of the T2 chip (e.g. based on the A12), we are still stuck with this vulnerability on Macs between 2018 and 2020.</p><h3 id="so-about-this-t2-thing">So about this T2 thing</h3><p>In case you are using a recent macOS device, you are probably using <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208862">the embedded T2 security chip</a> which runs <em>bridgeOS</em> and is actually based on watchOS. This is a custom ARM processor designed by Apple based on the A10 CPU found in the iPhone 7.
The T2 chip contains a <em>Secure Enclave Processor</em> (SEP), much like the A-series processor in your iPhone will contain a SEP.</p><p>While newer Macs and/or Apple Silicon (including the dev kit) will use a more recent A-series processor such as the one found in the recent iPhone (A12), current Macs still use the A10.</p><p>It performs a predefined set of tasks for macOS such as audio processing, handling I/O, functioning as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module">Hardware Security Module</a> for e.g. Apple KeyChain or 2FA, hardware accelerating media playback, whitelisting kernel extensions, cryptographic operations and <strong>ensuring the operating system you are booting is not tampered with</strong>.
The T2 chip runs its own firmware called <em>bridgeOS</em>, which can be updated when you install a new macOS version. (ever notice the screen flickering? that’s the display driver being interrupted and possibly updated.)</p><p><em>Edit</em>: I first mentioned the iPad Pro to be impacted by the T2 vulnerability, but while it could suffer from the same vulnerability, it does not contain a T2 chip.</p><h3 id="the-macos-boot-sequence">The macOS boot sequence</h3><p>So let’s focus on the boot image verification on macOS. What exactly happens when you press that power button?
<a href="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/bootprocess.png">There’s also a visual representation for any <em>conaisseurs</em></a>.
For the enthusiasts, I personally find <a href="https://michaellynn.github.io/2018/07/27/booting-secure/">Booting Secure by mikeymikey</a> a more in-depth description.</p><ol><li><p>The T2 chip is fully booted and stays on, even if your Mac device is shutdown.</p></li><li><p>The press of the power button or the opening of the lid triggers the System Management Controller (SMC) to boot.</p></li><li><p>The SMC performs a Power-On-Self-Test (POST) to detect any EFI or hardware issues such as bad RAM and possibly redirect to Recovery.</p></li><li><p>After those basic sanity checks, the T2 chip is triggered and I/O connectors are setup. (USB, NVMe, PCIe, …) It will use NVMe and PCIe to talk to NAND storage.</p></li><li><p>The applicable boot disk is selected and a disk encryption password is asked if enabled to mount <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_File_System">APFS</a> volumes possibly via FileVault2 disk encryption.</p></li><li><p><code>/System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi</code> is located on your System APFS volume and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208330">depending on your secure boot settings</a> is validated.</p></li><li><p><em>boot.efi</em> is ran which loads the Darwin kernel <em>(throwback to BSD)</em> (or Boot Camp if booting Microsoft Windows) &amp; IODevice drivers. If a kernel cache is found in <code>/System/Library/PrelinkedKernels/prelinkedkernel</code>, it will use that.</p></li><li><p>Any User Approved Kernel Extensions are initialized &amp; added to the kernel space -if- they are approved by the T2 chip.
<em>This will go away with System Extensions</em>.</p></li></ol><h3 id="macos-security-features">macOS security features</h3><p>So Apple has a couple of tricks up its sleeve to limit the attack surface of any potential security vulnerabilities. A small summary of related measures since macOS Big Sur on Intel processors:</p><ul><li><p><em>System Integrity Protection</em> (SIP): a read-only <code>/System</code> partition so the base install of macOS (including the kernel) cannot be tampered with.</p></li><li><p><em>System Extensions</em>: a move to away from Kernel Extensions, getting external code out of the Kernel framework-wise.</p></li><li><p><em>Secure Boot</em>: verifies the signature validity of the operating system on disk.</p></li><li><p><em>Filesystem seals</em>: every byte of data is compared to a hash in the filesystem metadata tree, recursively verifying integrity.</p></li></ul><h3 id="apple-marketing">Apple marketing</h3><p>As you probably all already know, Apple pushes forward privacy &amp; security as important weapons in todays world of technology.
They tout their devices as highly secure and vouch to handle your personal data using a privacy-centric approach.
While there have been mistakes made in the past (who can blame them?), Apple has been generally quick to fix any security issues that were disclosed to <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201220">their responsible disclosure program</a> or in public.</p><h2 id="security-issues">Security issues</h2><h3 id="jailbreaking">Jailbreaking</h3><h3 id="the-core-problem">The core problem</h3><p>The mini operating system on the T2 (<em>SepOS</em>) suffers from a security vulnerable also found in the iPhone 7 since it contains a processor based on the iOS A10. Exploitation of this type of processor for the sake of installing homebrew software is very actively discussed in the <a href="https://reddit.com/r/jailbreak/">/r/jailbreak</a> subreddit.</p><p>So using the <a href="https://checkm8.info/">checkm8 exploit</a> originally made for iPhones, the checkra1n exploit was developed to build a semi-tethered exploit for the T2 security chip, exploiting a flaw. This could be used to e.g. circumvent activation lock, allowing stolen iPhones or macOS devices to be reset and sold on the black market.</p><p>Normally the T2 chip will exit with a fatal error if it is in DFU mode and it detects a decryption call, but thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/windknown/presentations/blob/master/Attack_Secure_Boot_of_SEP.pdf">blackbird vulnerability</a> by team Pangu, we can completely circumvent that check in the SEP and do whatever we please.</p><p>Since sepOS/BootROM is <em>Read-Only Memory</em> for security reasons, interestingly, Apple cannot patch this core vulnerability without a new hardware revision.
This thankfully also means that this is not a persistent vulnerability, so it will require a hardware insert or other attached component such as a malicious USB-C cable.</p><h3 id="debugging">Debugging</h3><p>Every Apple iDevice (which includes the T2 and the Watch, via a port under the band) ships with a firmware recovery USB interface called Device Firmware Update (DFU), which is triggered when the device is not be able to boot or by pressing a particular set of buttons when turned on. It is always available because it is code run from SecureROM. This is the mode in which checkm8 runs.</p><p>Apple also leaves the ability to access various debug functionality which is disabled on production devices unless a special boot payload is used which runs in DFU. Since Apple is the only one who can sign code for DFU, they can demote any device they like, including the most recent A14 processors.
But since the checkm8 vulnerability runs so early in the boot process, we too can demote the T2 into DFU mode.
Without checkm8, we would not be able to run unsigned code in DFU and thus not be able enable debug interfaces. Once the debug interface is enabled Apple uses specialized cables with simian names (see Chimp, Kanzi, Gorilla).</p><h3 id="impact">Impact</h3><p>Once you have access on the T2, you have full <code>root</code> access and kernel execution privileges since the kernel is rewritten before execution.
Good news is that if you are using FileVault2 as disk encryption, they do not have access to your data on disk <em>immediately</em>.
They can however inject a keylogger in the T2 firmware since it manages keyboard access, storing your password for retrieval or transmitting it in the case of a malicious hardware attachment.</p><p>The functionality of locking an Apple device remotely (e.g. via MDM or FindMy) can be bypassed (<em>Activation Lock</em>).</p><p>A firmware password does not mitigate this issue since it requires keyboard access, and thus needs the T2 chip to run first.</p><p>Any kernel extension could be whitelisted since the T2 chip decides which one to load during boot.</p><p>If the attack is able to alter your hardware (or sneak in a malicious USB-C cable), it would be possible to achieve a semi-tethered exploit.</p><p>While this may not sound as frightening, be aware that this is a perfectly possible attack scenario for state actors.
I have sources that say more news is on the way in the upcoming weeks. I quote: <em>be afraid, be very afraid</em>.</p><h2 id="exploitation">Exploitation</h2><pre><code># install devtools
$ xcode-select --install

# check the script &amp; install homebrew
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"

# Bring up a proxy to dropbear
$ iproxy 2222 44 &amp;

# Connect to T2 &amp; enjoy
$ ssh -p 2222 root@127.0.0.1
</code></pre><h2 id="responsible-disclosure">Responsible Disclosure</h2><p>I’ve reached out to Apple concerning this issue on numerous occasions, even doing the dreaded cc <em>tcook@apple.com</em> to get some exposure.
Since I did not receive a response for weeks, I did the same to numerous news websites that cover Apple, but no response there as well.
In hope of raising more awareness (and an official response from Apple), I am hereby disclosing almost all of the details.
You could argue I’m not following responsible disclosure, but since this issue has been known since 2019, I think …</p></div></div></div>

<p>This week, spreadsheets hit the news again, when data for a book written by economist Pikkety turned out to contain&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/05/23/financial_times_on_piketty_his_data_is_wrong.html">spreadsheet errors</a>. On this, Daniele Lemire wrote a blog post warning people&nbsp;<a href="http://lemire.me/blog/archives/2014/05/23/you-shouldnt-use-a-spreadsheet-for-important-work-i-mean-it/">not to use spreadsheets for serious work</a>. This is useless advice, let me explain why.</p>
<p><strong>1) Only a fool blames their&nbsp;tool</strong></p>
<p>Heathcare.gov is built in Java. Did people go around the interwebs shouting&nbsp;we all should stop using Java? Of course not! Because it is easy to see that the problems stemmed from other areas: process, time pressure, lack of testing and other (human) factors probably. See how silly it is to blame a tool? The same goes for spreadsheets. Yes, they are not so easy to test,&nbsp;but they have many benefits, like ‘liveness’ (immediate feedback), having data, metadata and calculations in one view, ease of deployment. In that sense, they have&nbsp;benefits over other programming environments.</p>
<p><strong>2) No, we do not know better!&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I have been working on spreadsheets as a researcher for about 5 years now, and during that time I spoke with a lot of spreadsheet users. Of course, I asked them why they would run a bank/insurance company/airline on spreadsheets. You know what many of them say?</p>
<p><em>“We asked IT to build this, they said it would take 6 months and half a million euros. And most likely it will be more expensive and not what we want.”</em></p>
<p>The reality is that it is just not feasible to build software for all business processes. We don’t have the manpower, and frankly, in many cases also not the domain skill needed. So what we need to do isn’t ridicule spreadsheet users.&nbsp;They have been disappointed by us many times. I already mentioned healthcare.gov and there are so many other IT screw-ups that it is almost&nbsp;arrogant to claim superiority over the spreadsheet users.</p>
<p><strong>3) Like democracy, spreadsheets are the worst, except for all others</strong></p>
<p>Then, in addition to our riducule, we try to push tools to them, “real” programming languages, that nor fit their needs nor their skills. They will never learn Java or C#. Python maybe, that seems to be easy to use for end-users, but certainly not for all of them. End-users are not programmers, they don’t want to be and they should not need to be.</p>
<p>Instead of shaming spreadsheet users, let’s focus on inventing better spreadsheet-killers tools (Tableau is my personal favorite at the moment). Or, and this is my line of research, help spreadsheet users to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.felienne.com/archives/2957">test</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://figshare.com/articles/Detecting_and_refactoring_code_smells_in_spreadsheet_formulas/980655">measure</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.felienne.com/archives/2964">refactor</a>. No one, really, no one, is helped with your judgement without thinking about alternatives.</p>

  <p>I meet regularly with early-career software developers. A few recurring meetings, 1x/week, plus ad-hoc calls as needed with others.</p>

<p>A question came up recently:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My three-month internship is close to wrapping up. The Co-founder/CEO/lead developer of the consulting company I’m at likes me, said he wishes he could hire me but cannot, because they don’t have enough work in the pipeline.</p>

  <p>He said he’d write me a letter of recommendation, and asked me to draft it for him.</p>

  <p>How do I write my own letter of recommendation, for my first real software development job?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Feels like a trap, huh?</p>

<p><img src="https://josh.works/images/office-hours-tufts.jpeg" alt="who are you?"></p>

<p><a href="https://admissions.tufts.edu/blogs/jumbo-talk/post/the-office-hours/"><em>source</em></a></p>

<p>Or, maybe they know you. They know you <em>too well</em></p>

<p><img src="https://josh.works/images/recommendation-warning.jpg" alt="untrustworthy"></p>

<p><a href="https://blacklawyermagic.wordpress.com/"><em>source</em></a></p>

<p>I explained a few concepts that we wanted to “speak to” in the letter. I’ll explain.</p>

<p>The software developer that I meet with mentioned that the CEO’s advice on the next job included “be able to speak to low liability”.</p>

<p>I wanted to dig into this “liability” piece.</p>

      </h2>
    

<p>What’s the biggest risk in hiring?</p>

<p>It’s <em>the risk of a bad hire</em>.</p>

<p>How much does it cost to make a bad hire?</p>

<p>I would conservatively estimate that it costs $100,000 and nine months of your life. Here’s how the math works from a hiring manager’s point of view:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Spend a month and 25 hours of labor dev team manager labor to find/interview the candidate(s) and winnow the applicants down to someone to make an offer.  (the hiring manager would prefer to be doing <em>literally anything else but hiring</em>.)</li>
  <li>Extend an offer, wait 2-6 more weeks before the new candidate starts. It can be painful to wait another six weeks, because the team is currently short-staffed, and has been for a long time. That’s why they’re hiring!</li>
  <li>Start date! Start paying $150,000/yr or $3000/week for your shiny new employee.</li>
  <li>Pay $12,000 for the first month of them working, figuring out your dev environment, ticket management, who knows what parts of the codebase, and a few easy bug fixes.</li>
  <li>Start getting nervous. Employee not batting it out of the park like you’d hoped. Maybe still onboarding, give it another month (and $12,000 in payroll expense).</li>
  <li>OK. Three months in and another $36,000 in payroll later, you’re pretty sure there’s a problem.</li>
  <li>Start the pre-Performance Improvement Plan work. Talk to their team, their manager, them. Why is it not working? Why is the team <em>working slower</em> with this new team member, instead of working faster? <em>Not only are you wasting five figures of payroll, the rest of your expensive dev team is producing less as well!</em></li>
  <li>Pre-PIP work is over. Another $5k in payroll gone forever. Now it’s time to give the formal PIP, which everyone knows is “beginning the firing process”</li>
  <li>Two more months and $24,000 in payroll later, you fire the employee.</li>
  <li>You feel relief with having gotten rid of the bad employee. You’re thrilled that you can get back to normal work.</li>
  <li>Check the clock and balance sheet. It took you nine months and $100k to get to where you were at step 1.</li>
</ol>

<p>Add up the time/expense:</p>

<ol>
  <li>1-2 months to to find/hire a candidate.</li>
  <li>7-8 months (and $84K-$96k) to hire, trial them, try to help them be successful, give up on that plan, and fire them.</li>
  <li>Many hours spent thinking about this specific problem, talking with others about it.</li>
</ol>

<p>There’s nine months of your life. That’s 9 months of time, sure, but it’s also 9 months of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost">opportunity cost</a>. What if you’d hired a great candidate? They’d be rapidly approaching their first year on the job, and everyone would be happy about it, instead of this disaster you’ve had to deal with.</p>

<p>Here’s the really scary part: To large organizations (1000+ employees), <em>wasting $100k is meaningless compared to the wasted time and mis-directed effort</em>. The entire organization is more annoyed at having <em>lost the time of a productive software developer</em>. They don’t care that they lit a giant pile of money on fire, <em>they’re annoyed that their competitor is getting new features out the door and gaining marketshare and the future of their $x,000,000 company hangs in the balance</em>.</p>

<p>Oh, and the good managers, not only do they want to be wise with money and build features/gain market-share…</p>

<p>They want to see their team flourish.</p>

<p>Being fired is a life-defining moment. (I speak from experience)</p>

<p>If you’re a kind and empathetic person, <em>it’s particularly unpleasent to fire someone and it feels like a personal failure</em>.</p>

<p>You want to work for a kind and empathetic manager. (They’re not common, but they’re not impossible to find.)</p>

<p>So, tailor your letter to speak to the concerns of a kind and empathetic manager. This manager would:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Want to see you do well</li>
  <li>Want to see you develop your skills and competencies</li>
  <li>Want you to make meaningful contributions to the product</li>
  <li>Want a healthy team dynamic</li>
  <li>Want you to voice concerns and observations as relevant</li>
</ul>

<p>And much more</p>

          A Primary-goal for an early-career software developer: Telegraph Low Liability <a href="#a-primary-goal-for-an-early-career-software-developer-telegraph-low-liability">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>First, when I say <code>telegraph low liability</code> I mean it in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphing_(sports)">sports definition</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In sporting terminology, to <strong>telegraph</strong> is to unintentionally alert an opponent to one’s immediate situation or intentions. The sporting use of the term <em>telegraph</em> draws a direct comparison with the communication device of the same name. “Telegraphing” always refers to a reflexive physical action rather than a protracted or intellectual give-away. For example, a boxer rotating his shoulders to throw a hook would be telegraphing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should aim to “telegraph” that you’re a low-liability hire <em>without ever saying it so explicitely</em>. It’s a subtle thing, best communicated incidentally, not directly.</p>

<p>Five years ago, I wrote <a href="https://josh.works/so-you-want-to-work-remotely">So you want to work remotely…</a></p>

<p>Quoting myself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First, there’s the matter of framing how you go about working remotely. Obviously you want to work remotely, but put yourself in the shoes of a prospective employer. They don’t care if you work remotely or not - they want you to do great work for them and make them an effective, profitable organization.</p>

  <p>Companies that hire remotely tend to be younger, agile-er, and smaller. So every employee matters. Making a bad hire can be catastrophic in terms of money and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost">opportunity cost</a>. Your job is to make it very, very obvious that hiring YOU is a great decision. In fact, you want to be so good at what you do that passing up on you is a terrible decision.</p>

  <p>[…]</p>

  <p>When you can walk someone down the path from “Hire me” to “I’ll help you make <code>$x00,000/year</code> more than you would otherwise”, <em>you’re talking their language</em>. You’re <em>telegraphing</em> that you understand their concerns without ever stating their concern explicitly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To bring it full circle, here’s how I would go about <em>drafting</em> a CEO’s Letter of Recommendation <em>for me</em>. If you find this idea uncomfortable, don’t worry about it. That’s a sign of psychological health, that you don’t love putting flattering words <em>about yourself</em> into other people’s mouths.</p>
      
    

<p>Normally, that’s a good aversion to have. For this particular situation, you’ll have to bite the bullet and move on. I’m not going to give you the actual words (how could I?) but I’ll explain my process. I’ll include comments throughout:</p>

      </h3>
    

<div><div><pre><code>Hi there,         
# I find it easier to strike a natural tone when thinking relatively

      </h3>
    

<p>This is the first uncomfortable sentence you’ll have to write:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Hi there,

I met {Zaniyah} {a few months ago} because {she and I crossed paths
at a local Ruby meetup}.

# No gushing required. A claim of "I would hire this 
# person if I could" is plenty strong social signaling. 
I wish I could hire them myself, but don't have the budget and work
lined up to utilize them to their full potential. 

Sincerely,
- Boss's name, Title, Company
</code></pre></div></div>
      
    

<p>This can be hard to think of an anecdote. It might take a few attempts to feel good about the one you’ve chosen and how you speak of it. Just write something down, see how you feel, delete it, write something else down, etc.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Hi there,

When she started at {company}, one of the first things she did was 
make many updates to our onboarding documentation. 

It was rather out-of-date, and the team hadn't had new hires in a 
while. 

Any time she ran into friction or trouble, she would hunt down the 
answer, and immediately update the documentation so the next 
person would have a smoother process.

Sure enough, the next hire spent half the time she …</code></pre></div></div></article></div>

  <article>
    <p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/chaos1.jpg" alt="Chaos, an important theme in hermetism" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>We live in a world that is gradually and incessantly attracted by
over-rationality and order. In this article we’ll burst the enchanted
bubble and embrace corruption and chaos — We’re going to discuss the
topic of image glitch art.</p>

<h2 id="w̸h̸a̷t̴̶s̴-̶a̴-̷g̷l̸i̷t̴c̵h̵">w̸h̸a̷t̴’̶s̴ ̶a̴ ̷g̷l̸i̷t̴c̵h̵</h2>

<p>Welcome to the land of creative destruction: image glitch art. Our story
starts with a simple idea: glitching a wallpaper to create a slideshow
of corrupted pictures.<br>
The unfortunate victim of our crime: The world (Right click <strong>&gt;</strong> View
image, while keeping the <strong>Control</strong> key pressed, to admire it in more
details while its still in its pristine form):</p>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/glitch_art/world_map.jpg" alt="World Map, nominal case" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>Before we begin, let’s attempt to define what we’re trying to do: What
is glitch art?<br>
Like any art movement, words can barely express the essence behind the
meaning, they are but fleeting and nebulous. Regardless, I’ll be an
infidel and valiantly express what I think glitch art is.</p>

<p>A glitch is a perturbation, a minor malfunction, a spurious signal. In
computers, glitches are predominantly accidental events that are
undesirable and could possibly corrupt data.<br>
Glitch art started as people developed a liking for such unusual events
and the effects glitches had on the media they were perturbing. Some started
to collect these glitches that happened naturally in the wild, and others
started to intentionally appropriate the effects by manually performing them.<br>
In the art scene, some started using image processing to “fake” true
glitching effects.</p>

<p>Glitches happen all the time and everywhere, information is never as
durable and reliable as we might like it to be, and living in a physical
world makes it even less so. You’ve probably encountered or heard of the
effect of putting a magnet next to anything electronic that hasn’t been
rugged to withstand such scenario.<br>
That’s why many techniques have been put in place to avoid glitches,
at all layers, from the hardware storage, to the software reading
and interpreting it. Be it error correcting codes (ECC) or error detection
algorithms, they are all enemies of glitch art and the chaos we like.</p>

<p>However, this niche aesthetic is more than a fun pass-time for computer
aficionado, there is a bigger picture. Similar to painters with
brushes on a canvas, we are offered a material, an object to work with
— a material made of bits and formatted in a specific way.<br>
Like any object, our medium has a form and meaning, it can move, it has
a size, it can be transferred, and interpreted — information theory
is the field interested in this.<br>
Like any object, our medium can be subject and react to deformations,
forces, and stressors. How it flows is what the field of rheology
is interested in (not to be confused with computational rheology, the
field of fluid simulation.) The medium fluidity can be studied to answer
questions such as: is it elastic, solid, viscous, or oily, how does it
respond, within the bound of information theory, to different types of
applied forces.</p>

<p>Here are some words you may encounter and that you definitely want
to know:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Misregistration: Whenever a physical medium misread data because of
damages caused by scratches, dirt, smudges, gamma rays, or any other
treasures the universe throws at us.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Datamoshing, Photomosh, Imagemosh: Abusing the format of a medium,
normally compression artefacts, to create glitches. For example, video
compression often use i-frames for fixed images and p-frame for the
movement/transition of pixels on that image. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datamoshing/">Removing i-frames is a
common glitching method</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Databending: An idea taken from circuit bending, bending the circuit
board of a toy to generate weird sounds. Databending is about bending
the medium into another unrelated one, reinterpreting it as something
it is not meant to be.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Let me add that glitch art is vast and fascinating, this article is but a
glimpse into this space. If you’re captivated as much as I am, please take
a look at <a href="http://gli.tc/h/0nline/">gli.tc</a> and <a href="https://beyondresolution.info/">Rosa Menkman’s Beyond
Resolution</a>. Images can be pleasantly
destroyed in a great number of ways to create masterpieces.</p>

<h2 id="i̷m̷a̷g̴e̴-̸g̸l̴i̴t̴c̵h̸-̴a̶r̵t̵">I̷m̷a̷g̴e̴ ̸G̸l̴i̴t̴c̵h̸ ̴A̶r̵t̵</h2>

<p>Before starting let’s give some advices:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Back up your precious files before corrupting them.</li>
  <li>Any glitching techniques can be combined and/or applied multiple times.</li>
  <li>Sometimes too little has no effect, and sometimes too much can destroy
the file.</li>
  <li>It’s all about trials and errors, especially errors that result in
glitches.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="̷h̷o̵w̶-̵t̸o̴-̶i̷n̶d̸u̷c̶e̵-̶a̸-̶g̸l̵i̷t̶c̸h̴">̷H̷o̵w̶ ̵T̸o̴ ̶I̷n̶d̸u̷c̶e̵ ̶A̸ ̶G̸l̵i̷t̶c̸h̴</h3>

<p>Now it’s time to think about how we can apply our mischievous little
stimuli, its size, the level or layer at which it’ll be applied, and
the methodological recipe we’ll concoct to poison our images.</p>

<p>Glitch artist Benjamin Berg classifies glitches into 3 categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Incorrect Editing: Editing a file using a software that
wasn’t made to edit such file. Like editing an image file as if it
was a text file.</li>
  <li>Reinterpretation aka Databending: Convert or read a file as if it was
another type of medium. Like listening to an image file as if it was
an audio file (aka sonification).</li>
  <li>Forced errors, Datamoshing, and Misregistration: A software or hardware
bug to force specific errors in the file. This can be about the
corruption of specific bytes in the file to induce glitches, or
something happening accidentally like a device turning off when saving
a file.</li>
</ul>

<p>So let’s get to work!</p>

<h3 id="m̷a̵s̵h̸i̶n̶g̷-̴t̶h̷e̷-̷d̶a̸t̵a̸-̸r̷a̸n̶d̶o̸m̴l̵y̷">M̷a̵s̵h̸i̶n̶g̷ ̴T̶h̷e̷ ̷D̶a̸t̵a̸ ̸R̷a̸n̶d̶o̸m̴l̵y̷</h3>

<p>The easiest, but roughest, way to glitch a file is to put on our monkey
suit and overwrite or add random bytes in our image. As you would have
guessed, this isn’t very efficient but half the time it does the trick
and forces errors.</p>

<p>This technique is better suited for stronger materials like images in
raw format — without metadata and headers. We’ll understand why in a bit.<br>
To convert the file to raw format, open it in GIMP, select <strong>Export As</strong>,
select the file by extension, and choose the raw type. For now, it doesn’t
matter if you pick pixel-ordered or planar, but we’ll come back to this
choice later because it’s an important one.</p>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/glitch_art/gimp_saveas_raw.jpg" alt="GIMP process to save image as raw" loading="lazy"></p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">file world_map.data
<span># world_map.data: Targa image data - Map (771-3) 771 x 259 x 1 - 1-bit alpha "\003\003\003\003\003\003\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001"</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You should also note the width and height of the image as it now doesn’t
contain this information anymore, and we’ll need those to reopen it in
GIMP. In our case it is <code>2000x1479</code>.</p>

<p>We now proceed to hand over the file to our least favorite
staff and let them have an anger tantrum at it. So what does
it look like, let’s take a look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6NMiuU0ys">the result our monkey
did</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/glitch_art/world_map_random_bytes.jpg" alt="World Map, monkey have been randomly mashing the
world" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>Not bad at all for something random, but we can do better.</p>

<h3 id="c̸o̶m̸p̷r̶e̷s̸s̵i̸o̶n̴-̶d̵e̵f̶o̶r̴m̷a̶t̷i̵o̸n̷">C̸o̶m̸p̷r̶e̷s̸s̵i̸o̶n̴ ̶D̵e̵f̶o̶r̴m̷a̶t̷i̵o̸n̷</h3>

<p>Some medium are more malleable when squished properly and squished
in different ways. The image sheds a lot of information and only the
essence stays. That’s a form of databending.<br>
For example, increasing the compression of JPEG images can open the path
for glitches to happen more frequently. This is a key asset, especially
when trying to create errors related to the compression parameters within
the format of the file.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">convert <span>-quality</span> 2 world_map.jpg world_map_compressed.jpg</code></pre></figure>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/glitch_art/world_map_compressed.jpg" alt="World Map, compressed to extract its
essence" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>Keep this in your toolbox to use along with other techniques.</p>

<h3 id="g̵e̴t̵t̶i̸n̵g̷-̴i̸n̵t̷i̵m̷a̴t̸e̴-̸w̶i̵t̸h̶-̴t̵h̸e̸-̴f̷o̴r̶m̸a̴t̷">G̵e̴t̵t̶i̸n̵g̷ ̴I̸n̵t̷i̵m̷a̴t̸e̴ ̸W̶i̵t̸h̶ ̴T̵h̸e̸ ̴F̷o̴r̶m̸a̴t̷</h3>

<p>We want to corrupt in the most efficient way possible, to create
attractive chaos from the smallest change possible. To do that we have to
get intimate with the medium, to understand its deepest secrets, tickle
the image in the right places. This is what we previously referred to
as imagemoshing.</p>

<p>There’s a panoply of image formats, and they all are special in their
own ways. However, there’s still some commonality:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Header, Footer, and Metadata: If the format contains these extra
information, be it extraneous or essential, what they represent, and
how they affect the rest of the image.</li>
  <li>Compression: The format can either be compressed or not. When it is
compressed, there can be extra bits of information to help other software
uncompress the image data.</li>
  <li>How the data is laid out: Usually, the image color information is
decomposed into its components such as HSL, RGB, or others. These
components then need to be represented in the image data, either in
an interleaved or planar manner. Planar refers to writing components
independently in the data (<em>ex:</em> all R, then all G, then all B),
while interleaved refers to having them joined non-contiguously in an
alternate sequence (<em>ex:</em> RGB, then RGB, then RGB..).</li>
</ul>

<p>Manipulating these to our advantage can lead to wonderful glitches. For
example, in our previous raw image example — an image bare of header,
footer, and without compression — the pixels were interleaved which
gave rise to the effect we’ve seen, namely shifts and changes in some
colors. Having them in planar form would’ve led to different glitches
in separate color channels.</p>

<h3 id="r̵e̷i̷n̴t̶e̷r̶p̸r̴e̸t̸a̷t̶i̷o̵n̴-̵a̸s̵-̵r̸i̷c̵h̸-̸t̷e̵x̵t̴-̴a̴k̷a̸-̷w̶o̴r̵d̴p̴a̸d̵-̷e̵f̸f̴e̶c̶t̶">R̵e̷i̷n̴t̶e̷r̶p̸r̴e̸t̸a̷t̶i̷o̵n̴ ̵A̸s̵ ̵R̸i̷c̵h̸ ̸T̷e̵x̵t̴ ̴A̴K̷A̸ ̷W̶o̴r̵d̴P̴a̸d̵ ̷E̵f̸f̴e̶c̶t̶</h3>

<p>Let’s give this a try with the well-known WordPad effect, which is about
databending an image into rich text: opening the image in WordPad and
saving it.<br>
Keep in mind that this only works with raw images as it’s highly
destructive and otherwise could break fragile key info in the header
and footer. So let’s reuse our interleaved raw image of earlier but also
get a planar one.</p>

<p>This is our results for interleaved:</p>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/glitch_art/world_map_wordpad.interleaved.corrupt.jpg" alt="World Map, WordPad effect interleaved" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>And for planar:</p>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/glitch_art/world_map_wordpad.planar.corrupt.jpg" alt="World Map, WordPad effect planar" loading="lazy"></p>

        <blockquote><p>Applications need to go global, but language support comes at a cost. For one thing, supporting multiple languages demands additional testing rigor.</p></blockquote>
<p>For many businesses trying to get ahead in an increasingly competitive world, multi-language support is a must-have feature. Internationalization – or I18N, as it’s frequently abbreviated for the 18 letters between the I and the N – helps to make software more accessible to users in other countries and also can provide an important advantage for non-native speakers in your own country.</p>
<p>There’s an entire software development side to I18N, obviously. However, testing can be as critical, if not more so, than plopping language support into the code. Below are five gotchas to look out for when testing software internationalization.</p>
<h3>The German problem</h3>
<p>German has become the poster child for words and phrases that can blow up on you when translated. Consider a label for a form with the text “Job Description.” That’s 14 characters in English, but the corresponding German phrase is “Arbeitsbeschreibung,” which clocks in at a whopping 19 characters.</p>
<p>This can create headaches on several fronts. The most obvious is that if the layout is tight and you didn’t make allowances for labels to expand and contract, you can end up with truncated text (or worse, abominations such as “Arbeit…reibung”). Modern responsive web design has minimized this issue, but in “pixel-perfect” apps such as games, it can bite you in a tender place.</p>
<p>Also, languages such as German can string many words into one long mega-word, which can cause text to break awkwardly in a paragraph if the text field is too narrow. Even if there’s space for all the text in, for example, a scrolling text box, it may end up looking like an ugly staircase if there are lines with only one or two words and a lot of white space at the end. And speaking of the end…</p>
<h3>Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left Right, B, A, Start</h3>
<p>English speakers are used to certain conventions as to text and forms. Labels are on the left, fields on the right. But what happens when you translate an application into Hebrew (which reads right to left), or Asian languages that read top to bottom. As far as I know, there are no languages that read bottom to top, thank goodness, but you do still need to make sure that all of your text lays out correctly to the regional norms for each languages.</p>
<p>This may mean reversing the entire screen layout, or perhaps just changing justification rules. But when testing, you need to make sure that it make sense and follows the natural flow for native speakers.</p>
<h3>Injection molding</h3>
<p>It’s very common for programmers to create formatting strings that inject a value in the middle. For example, in pseudo-code, you might have something like:</p>
<p><code>print(“You have “ + balance + “ points.”)</code></p>
<p>Inevitably, someone points out that when you have one point, the application prints “1 points” – so you fix the code to:</p>
<p><code>if points == 1:<br>
print(“You have 1 point”)<br>
else<br>
print(“You have “ + balance + “points”)</code></p>
<p>The problem with this strategy comes when you internationalize your software. When you substitute the “You have” and “points” into other languages, you can encounter problems with plurals. You may also have to watch out for things like the genders of objects (“el” vs “la” in Spanish, for example, and then add in plural rules for “los” and “las”). If you don’t get these things right when you do your string construction and formatting, you can end up with things that are the equivalent of “You has three banana in your carts.”</p>
<h3>Reuse abuse</h3>
<p>Most internationalization is accomplished by maintaining a dictionary file that maps a key (i.e. “THANK_YOU”) to a value in each language (Gracias, etc.). When a developer needs to internationalize a string, they usually start by looking for an existing mapping. That’s all well and good until you get a word that has multiple meanings.</p>
<p>Consider the entry for “trolley.” You might be referring to a cart in one case, and a form of mass transit in another. A shopping site might sell tea trolleys and also have directions for how to get to the store by public transportation. If the developer used the same word (el carrito) for both, you might end up asking your customers to ride a beverage cart to the store.</p>
<p>Of course, blindly literal translations of idioms or jargon can also lead to hilarity down the road. In general, you really need a native speaker (or at least a highly proficient speaker) to QA internationalized application versions.</p>
<h3>Dollars, cents, and other regionalization</h3>
<p>Does your application display currency information? How about dates? temperatures?</p>
<p>Well, depending on the region, there can be very different conventions for how to display them. In France, the Euro symbol goes after the amount, while in the UK, it goes before. Europe uses DD/MM/YYYY while the U.S. uses MM/DD/YYYY. This can affect not only display fields, but input fields too.</p>
<p>Metric vs. Imperial units is another fun example. Consider this variation on an earlier code snippet.</p>
<p><code>if temp == 1:<br>
print(“It is one degree out”)<br>
else<br>
print(“It is “ + convertToLocal(temp) + “degrees out”)</code></p>
<p>In this case, convertToLocal is a function that converts to the device/user’s unit preference (C or F).&nbsp; If it’s 32.5F (1C), you end up with “It is 1 degrees out” because the comparison isn’t done on the localized temperature. This type of stuff crops up all the time.</p>
<h2>A final word</h2>
<p>Testing I18N functionality isn’t just a matter of making sure that all the text in the application appears to be in the correct language. Formatting, context, appropriate grammar, and differences in conventions can all lead to software that is off-putting to someone in a difference region, or even downright offensive. If you’re going to make the effort to localize your software, it makes sense to invest in appropriate testing resources.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-479" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork" itemscope="itemscope"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>50 years ago it was very hard to collaborate over code. When developing large scale software projects it was difficult to manage changes to source code over time, as revision control tools were only starting to enter mainstream computing.</p><p>The adoption of version control tools, first centralized and then distributed, changed all that, and now even when a developer works alone, she’ll find it easier to work with Git than to manage the files on her own.</p><p>Version control systems were only the beginning of the revolution in efficiency, but they were the basis for the CI/CD capabilities by allowing to cleanly separate the development and release phases. Today working without these is unimaginable.</p><p>The world of data is now where the world of code was 50 years ago. We manage large data sets on object storages (e.g. S3, Azure Blob Storage, GCS), essentially a huge shared folder, and hope for the best. Although this environment has proven to be cost effective and scalable, managing data pipelines over it is highly error prone.</p><p>As data engineers, we should manage data the way we manage code. We should have a simple way to create a development environment, a safe way to consciously ingest data into our data lake, and a resilient production environment we deploy new data to. It was with this need in mind that lakeFS was created.</p><h2>Development Environment</h2><p>As part of our routine work with data we develop new code, improve and upgrade old code, upgrade infrastructures, and test new technologies.</p><p>lakeFS enables a safe development environment on your data lake without the need to copy or mock data, work on the pipelines or involve DevOps.</p><p>Creating a <a href="https://docs.lakefs.io/branching/model.html">branch</a> provides you an isolated environment with a snapshot of your repository (any part of your data lake you chose to manage on lakeFS). While working on your own branch in isolation, all other data users will be looking at the repository’s master branch. They can’t see your changes, and you don’t see changes to master done after you created the branch.&nbsp;</p><p>No worries, no data duplication is done, it’s all metadata management behind the scenes.</p><p>Let’s look at 3 examples of a development environment and their branching models.</p><h4><strong>Example 1: Upgrading Spark and using Revert action</strong></h4><p>You installed the latest version of Apache Spark. As a first step you’ll test your Spark jobs to see that the upgrade doesn’t have any undesired side effects.</p><p>For this purpose, you may create a branch (testing-spark-3.0) which will only be used to test the Spark upgrade, and discarded later. Jobs may run smoothly (the theoretical possibility exists!), or they may fail halfway through, leaving you with some intermediate partitions, data and metadata.</p><p>In this case, you can simply <strong>revert</strong> the branch to its original state, without worrying about the intermediate results of your last experiment. You can perform another (hopefully successful) test in an isolated branch. Revert actions are atomic and immediate, so no manual cleanup is required.</p><p>Once testing is completed and you have achieved the desired result, you can delete this experimental branch. Data that wasn’t used on any other branch will be deleted with it.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/4muYGGlBlctZCojZZ-atiEXDcezASOKsPlEBrJvx59RxZy0n_rPlXiJWCPhVHlNqZa_x4ANVUTK00OAmun_cpKUJFjVxlE4FQTruHjAmt6uNf0ImLLqtt4YM0yCQReR8rjhtVz1m" alt="Safe experimentation on your data" width="580" height="218" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption><span>Example 1: Safe experimentation&nbsp;</span></figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Example 2: Compare – Which option is better?</strong></h4><p>Easily compare by testing which one performs better on your data set.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Benchmarks may be:</strong></p><ul><li>Different computation tools, e.g Spark vs. <a href="https://lakefs.io/2020/08/31/the-quick-guide-for-running-presto-locally-on-s3/">Presto</a></li><li>Compression algorithms</li><li>Spark configurations</li><li>Code versions of an ETL</li></ul><p>Run each experiment on its own independent branch, while the master remains untouched. Once both experiments are done, create a comparison query (using <a href="https://docs.lakefs.io/using/glue_hive_metastore.html">hive or presto</a> or any other tool of your choice) to compare data characteristics, performance or any other metric you see fit.</p><p>With lakeFS you don’t need to worry about creating data paths for the experiments, copying data, and remembering to delete it. It’s substantially easier to avoid errors and maintain a clean lake after.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/axR5MOFKm0ltk-YRMzfwaKpQ3lRhRLa4CgyCCjt49yqsPnrBkNXFQ1btxbkhttEEnTrCAwQLzYOVBXZjKLNqkEPdXRexNvorIalQ_kKtUlSySg5eU3qE0bcRnR4e0dnHA4fO-q3a" alt="Fast and reliable comparisons on real data" width="580" height="293" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption><span>Example 2: Fast and reliable comparisons&nbsp;</span></figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Example 3: Reproduce – A bug in production</strong></h4><p>You upgraded spark and deployed&nbsp; changes in&nbsp; production. A few days or weeks later, you identify a data quality issue, a performance degradation or an increase to your infra costs. Something that requires investigation and fixing (aka, a bug).</p><p>lakeFS allows you to open a branch of your lake from the specific merge/commit that introduced the changes to production. Using the metadata saved on the merge/commit you can reproduce all aspects of the environment, then reproduce the issue on the branch and debug it.</p><p>Meanwhile,&nbsp; you can revert the master to a previous point in time, or keep it as is, depending on the use case.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TvnxIDLXqb9VElUN8xKvyR9R4Ytv00jATc3ewhalu_Dm7dxXV31kIIDC0RedLtPpg6Mo-EqlrIntSX2TPfIp6fK89ucEJ9fRUaN10Q9nE7JS85D_y7Qyxjjv7MUfe1WIFMRpiPWe" alt="Branch to reproduce " width="576" height="250" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption><span>Example 3: Branch to reproduce&nbsp;</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Continuous Integration</h2><p>Everyday data lake management includes ingestion of new data collections, and a growing number of consumers reading and writing analysis results to the lake.</p><p>In order to ensure our lake is reliable we need to validate new data sources, enforce good practices to maintain a clean lake (avoid the swamp) and validate metadata.</p><p>lakeFS simplifies continuous integration of data to the lake by supporting ingestion on a designated branch. Merging data to master is enabled only if conditions apply. To make this tenable, let’s look at a few examples:</p><h4><strong>Example 1: Pre-merge hooks – enforce best practices</strong></h4><p>Examples of good practices enforced in organizations:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ul><li>No user_* columns except under /private/…</li><li>Only (*.parquet | *.orc | _delta_log/*.json) files allowed</li><li>Under /<strong>production</strong>, only backwards-compatible schema changes are allowed</li><li>New tables on master must be registered in our metadata repository first, with owner and SLA</li></ul><p>lakeFS will assist in enforcing best practices by giving you a designated branch&nbsp; to ingest new data (“new-data-1” in the drawing). . You may run automated tests to validate&nbsp; predefined&nbsp; best practices as pre-merge hooks. If the validation passes, the new data will be automatically and atomically merged to the master branch. However, if the validation fails, you will be alerted, and the new data will not be exposed to consumers.</p><p>By using this branching model and implementing best practices as pre merge hooks, you ensure the master lake is never compromised.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pp0SCgLhZC9gPDgHWS4sPtbrqFOGQIEJ3_hg6Y0SddVF-QyXoLKSKQ3GwAC7N1ueyRihKtF_lOgVlDbbcUntK7XUfrZg1lzQEmBeURyuHBfETkek-D5t0iZz205asn5hM8zD3uyT" alt="Branch enabling pre-commit hooks" width="577" height="281" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption><span>Example 1: Branch enabling pre-commit hooks</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Continuous Deployment</h2><p>Not every day we introduce new data to the lake, or add/change ETLs, but we do have recurring jobs that are running, and updates to our existing data collections. Even if&nbsp; the code and infra didn’t change, the data might, and those changes introduce quality issues.</p><p>This is one of the complexities of a data product, the data we consume changes over the course of a month, a week, or even a single day.&nbsp;</p><p>Examples of changes to data that may occur:</p><ul><li>A client side bug in the data collection of website events</li><li>A new Android version that interferes with the collecting events from your App</li><li>COVID-19 abrupt impact on consumers behavior, and its effect on the accuracy of ML models</li><li>During a change to Salesforce interface, the validation requirement from a certain field was lost</li></ul><p>lakeFS helps you validate your expectations and assumptions from the data itself.</p><h4><strong>Example 1: Pre merge hook – a data quality issue</strong></h4><p>Continuous deployment of existing data we expect to consume, flowing from our ingest-pipelines into the lake. Similar to the Continuous Integration use-case, we create an ingest branch (“events-data”). This allows us to create tests using data analysis tools or data quality services (e.g. <a href="https://greatexpectations.io/">Great Expectations</a>, <a href="https://www.montecarlodata.com/">Monte Carlo</a>) to ensure reliability of the data we merge to the master branch. Since merge is atomic, no performance issue will be introduced by using lakeFS, but your master branch will only include quality data.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/L0LmOd2venczg6b0fG_gGoFLhiiMZRBikBJpdPCXnHZ60ha_bhngnSKgRwVCTBO8KNfX9PMg-fBT8KpKluldMLCWANZsR80uxTnQzWwCRCq3Kd-skALOpIaReBdgR-x94vycpH31" alt="Pre-merge hooks for data quality" width="581" height="283" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption><span>Example 1: Pre-merge hooks for data quality</span></figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Example 2: RollBack! Data ingested from a Kafka stream</strong></h4><p>If you introduce a new code version to production and discover it has a critical bug, you can simply roll back to the previous version. But you also need to roll back the results of running it.&nbsp; lakeFS gives you the power to rollback your data if you introduced low quality data.</p><p>The rollback is an atomic action that prevents the data consumers from receiving low quality data until the issue is resolved.</p><p>As previously mentioned, with lakeFS the recommended branching schema is to ingest data to a dedicated branch. When streaming data, we can decide to merge the incoming data to master at a given time interval or checkpoint, depending on how we chose to write it from <a href="https://docs.lakefs.io/using/kakfa.html">Kafka</a>. You can run quality tests for each merge (as presented in Example 1). Alas, tests are not perfect and we might still introduce low quality data at some point. In such a case, we can rollback master to the last known high quality commit, since our commits for streaming will include the metadata of the Kafka offset.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/SohaYl1t6ggaXNSp-TgzgwN6QeEAUebOa8hgMfc1oVYcmOafYJAQEbitvaF2KRcNVQbB4qgvLkE055vEPflyhXh1YxDZYe0Q-wHCJIzG5vzLYGzSKLJjq2uOBoxNpaHO_uPAstkL" alt="Rollback to safety" width="581" height="281" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption><span>Example 2: Rollback to safety</span></figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Example 3: Cross collection consistency</strong></h4><p>We often need consistency between different data collections. A few examples may be to:</p><ul><li>Join different collections in order to create a unified view of an account, a user or another entity we measure.</li><li>Introduce the same data in different formats</li><li>Introduce the same data with a different leading index or sorting due to performance considerations</li></ul><p>lakeFS will help ensure you introduce only consistent data to your consumers by exposing the new collections and their join in one atomic action to master. Once you consumed the collections on a different branch, and only when both are synchronized, we calculated the join and merged to master.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/LDjuIPQyIwcWc2e5UbbXFWNRE9DxuCD2Pcnm8q3tpgfMasVswq1tLK_dDJLy275ln0NMMLUkukNah458i3v7KNoFU99AJYXBoz6rSPxTL5lrvDcNFeJOfMCfBCAuZKAxf7CfldyE" alt="Cross collection consistency" width="576" height="259" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption><span>Example 3: Cross collection consistency</span></figcaption></figure><p>In this example you can see two data sets (Sales data and Marketing data) consumed each to its own independent branch.</p><p>Once the write of both data sets is completed, they are merged to a different branch (leads branch) where the join ETL runs and creates a joined collection by account. The joined table is then merged to master.</p><p>The same logic can apply if the data is ingested in streaming, using standard formats, or formats that allow upsert/delete such as Apache Hudi, Delta Lake or Iceberg.</p><h5><strong>Check out the project’s&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS">GitHub …</a></strong></h5></div></div></article></div>

    April 24, 2020
  </p>
  <p>I show how two domain-specific type systems, information flow control and two-party communication protocols, can be implemented in Rust using type-level programming. I explain how interesting properties of these domains can be verified at compile-time. Finally, I construct a general correspondence between type operators, logic programs, and their encoding in Rust.</p>
  <p>Typestate is the concept of encoding state machines in a programming language’s type system. While not specific to Rust, typestate has been <a href="http://cs242.stanford.edu/f19/lectures/08-2-typestate">explored</a> <a href="https://yoric.github.io/post/rust-typestate/">elsewhere</a> <a href="https://blog.systems.ethz.ch/blog/2018/a-hammer-you-can-only-hold-by-the-handle.html">at length</a> in the context of Rust. Typestate boils down to four ideas:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Each state is represented as a unique type.</li>
  <li>State transitions are only available as methods for the corresponding state type.</li>
  <li>Taking a state transition returns a state machine of the new state type.</li>
  <li>State transitions invalidate old state.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, here’s a state machine for a send-then-receive channel:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Each state is a unique type</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Receiving</span><span>;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Sending</span><span>;</span>

<span>// The state machine is parameterized by the state</span>
<span>#[repr(transparent)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Channel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>State</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>chan</span><span>:</span> <span>...</span><span>,</span>
  <span>_</span><span>state</span><span>:</span> <span>PhantomData</span><span>&lt;</span><span>State</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>}</span>


<span>// Methods for the state are uniquely associated with only the state</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>Channel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Receiving</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// recv consumes ownership, ensuring old state is invalidated</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>recv</span><span>(</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>Channel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Sending</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>msg</span> <span>=</span> <span>self</span><span>.chan</span><span>.recv</span><span>();</span>
    <span>// The state type changes after executing a transition</span>
    <span>(</span><span>unsafe</span> <span>{</span> <span>transmute</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>},</span> <span>msg</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>Channel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Sending</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>send</span><span>(</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>msg</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Channel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Receiving</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>unsafe</span> <span>{</span> <span>transmute</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>#[test]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>channel_test</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>c</span><span>:</span> <span>Channel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Sending</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>Channel</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>

  <span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>c</span><span>,</span> <span>msg</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>c</span><span>.recv</span><span>();</span>
  <span>// and so on</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24688233">many</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/gaxlm3/typelevel_programming_in_rust/fp2gjhg/">readers</a> concerned with the use of <code>transmute</code>. The use of <code>#[repr(transparent)]</code> ensures that the layout of <code>Channel</code> is <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/other-reprs.html#reprtransparent">stable across transmutations</a> of the marker type.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This pattern works effectively for simple finite state machines, where the logic to determine the next state is straightforward. In this note, I will explore situations where determining the next state is not so simple. In the process, we’ll talk about <strong>type-level programming</strong>, or how you can use Rust’s type system to encode <strong>computations on types</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Part of the goal of this note is to show the value of type-level programming in practice. These same mechanisms have already been used for more esoteric purposes like <a href="https://sdleffler.github.io/RustTypeSystemTuringComplete/">showing Rust’s type system is Turing complete</a>, but I think type-level programming can really help us design better systems!</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="1-information-flow-control">1. Information flow control</h2>

<p>As a first example, consider a basic information flow control problem. In our program we have low security values (anyone can read them) and high security values (only authorized users can read them).</p>

<p>We represent this idea like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Each security level is a type</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>HighSec</span><span>;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>LowSec</span><span>;</span>

<span>// An Item wraps an arbitrary type T, associating it with a Level</span>
<span>#[repr(transparent)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Item</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>Level</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>t</span><span>:</span> <span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
  <span>_</span><span>marker</span><span>:</span> <span>PhantomData</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Level</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Constructors for building items of a particular security</span>
<span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Item</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>LowSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>low_sec</span><span>(</span><span>t</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Item</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>LowSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<p>We would like to have a vector of these items with the following property:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If all of the items are low security, anyone can read any item.</li>
  <li>If any of the items are high security, only an authorized user can read any item.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, our vector should pass this test:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>SecureVec</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>lo</span> <span>=</span> <span>Item</span><span>::</span><span>low_sec</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>let</span> <span>hi</span> <span>=</span> <span>Item</span><span>::</span><span>high_sec</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>);</span>
<span>let</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>v</span><span>.push</span><span>(</span><span>lo</span><span>);</span>         <span>// v is still low sec</span>
<span>assert_eq!</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>v</span><span>.get</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>),</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>   <span>// ok to read v</span>

<span>let</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>v</span><span>.push</span><span>(</span><span>hi</span><span>);</span>         <span>// v is now high sec</span>
<span>// assert_eq!(v.get(0), 1); // can't read any more, compiler error</span>

<span>let</span> <span>w</span> <span>=</span> <span>HighSecWitness</span><span>::</span><span>login</span><span>();</span>
<span>assert_eq!</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>v</span><span>.get_secure</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>w</span><span>),</span> <span>2</span><span>);</span> <span>// can read after login</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A basic type-state attempt looks like this. We can create and read a low-security vector:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#[repr(transparent)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>SecureVec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>Level</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>items</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Item</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>Level</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>,</span>
  <span>_</span><span>marker</span><span>:</span> <span>PhantomData</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Level</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>SecureVec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>LowSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>SecureVec</span> <span>{</span> <span>items</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(),</span> <span>_</span><span>marker</span><span>:</span> <span>PhantomData</span> <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>get</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>:</span> <span>usize</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>T</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>.items</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And we can protect a high-security vector through a witness:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>HighSecWitness</span><span>;</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>HighSecWitness</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// sprinkle some high-security authentication in here...</span>
  <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>login</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>HighSecWitness</span> <span>{</span> <span>HighSecWitness</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>


<span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>SecureVec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>HighSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>get_secure</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>:</span> <span>usize</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>witness</span><span>:</span> <span>HighSecWitness</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>T</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>.items</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, to the main idea: how can we implement <code>push</code>? There are four possible state combinations: a high/low security vector with a high/low security item. While we can implement each combination as a separate method, it’s simpler to consider the underlying logic. <code>push</code> should return a vector of level <code>max(vec_level, item_level)</code> where <code>max(hi, lo) = hi</code>.</p>

<p>Our goal is to encode <code>max</code> as a <em>type-level computation</em>, i.e. an operator on types. The high-level idea:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Traits definitions are function signatures from types to types.</li>
  <li>Trait type parameters represent inputs and associated types represent outputs.</li>
  <li>Trait implementations define individual mappings from inputs to outputs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are those ideas in action to compute the max security level:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Self (implicitly) is the left operand, Other is the right operand,</span>
<span>// and Output is the output</span>
<span>trait</span> <span>ComputeMaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Other</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>type</span> <span>Output</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// These impls define the core computation</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>ComputeMaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>LowSec</span><span>&gt;</span>  <span>for</span> <span>LowSec</span>  <span>{</span> <span>type</span> <span>Output</span> <span>=</span> <span>LowSec</span><span>;</span>  <span>}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>ComputeMaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>HighSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>LowSec</span>  <span>{</span> <span>type</span> <span>Output</span> <span>=</span> <span>HighSec</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>ComputeMaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>LowSec</span><span>&gt;</span>  <span>for</span> <span>HighSec</span> <span>{</span> <span>type</span> <span>Output</span> <span>=</span> <span>HighSec</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>ComputeMaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>HighSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>HighSec</span> <span>{</span> <span>type</span> <span>Output</span> <span>=</span> <span>HighSec</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>

<span>// The type alias gives us a more convenient way to "call" the type operator</span>
<span>type</span> <span>MaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>L</span><span>,</span> <span>R</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>L</span> <span>as</span> <span>ComputeMaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>R</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>::</span><span>Output</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most confusing part is the <code>MaxLevel</code> alias. In brief: <code>L as ComputeMaxLevel&lt;R&gt;</code> says “treat <code>L</code> as the trait object <code>ComputeMaxLevel&lt;R&gt;</code>”. This is necessary since multiple computation traits may have associated <code>Output</code> with <code>L</code>, so the explicit cast disambiguates the <code>MaxLevel</code> computation from the rest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s an example of using the type operator:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>_</span> <span>:</span> <span>MaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>HighSec</span><span>,</span> <span>LowSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>HighSec</span><span>;</span> <span>// ok</span>
<span>let</span> <span>_</span> <span>:</span> <span>MaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>LowSec</span> <span>,</span> <span>LowSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>LowSec</span><span>;</span>  <span>// ok</span>
<span>let</span> <span>_</span> <span>:</span> <span>MaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>LowSec</span> <span>,</span> <span>LowSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>HighSec</span><span>;</span> <span>// type error</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, we can implement <code>SecureVec::push</code> in one method:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>VecLevel</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>SecureVec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>VecLevel</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>push</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ItemLevel</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span>
    <span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>,</span>
    <span>t</span><span>:</span> <span>Item</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ItemLevel</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
  <span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>SecureVec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>MaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ItemLevel</span><span>,</span> <span>VecLevel</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span>
  <span>where</span>
    <span>ItemLevel</span><span>:</span> <span>ComputeMaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>VecLevel</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
  <span>{</span>
    <span>unsafe</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>self</span><span>.items</span><span>.push</span><span>(</span><span>transmute</span><span>(</span><span>t</span><span>));</span>
      <span>transmute</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice the usage of <code>MaxLevel</code> in the return type of <code>push</code>. This is the key use of the type operator as a type-level computation. The other main component is the <code>where</code> clause: when used generically (over any possible <code>ItemLevel</code>), we have to use a trait bound to ensure that <code>ComputeMaxLevel</code> can be “called” on <code>ItemLevel</code>.</p>

<p>Excellent! We’ve now used a type-level computation to more abstractly specify typestate in our information flow control API. Next, we’ll look at an example with a more complex type-level program.</p>

<h2 id="2-two-party-communication-protocols">2. Two-party communication protocols</h2>

<p>When two parties synchronously communicate with each other (e.g. a client and server exchanging information), that communication protocol can be modeled as a session type. We’re going to look at session types <a href="https://munksgaard.me/papers/laumann-munksgaard-larsen.pdf">implemented in Rust</a>. While their full implementation is beyond the scope of the post (see the linked paper or my <a href="http://cs242.stanford.edu/f19/lectures/09-1-session-types">course notes</a>), I will focus on the aspects of session types that showcase type-level programming.</p>

<p>Session types are a domain-specific language of state machines, described by this grammar:</p>



<p>For example, this session type describes a ping server that sends and receives a ping in a loop, exiting on demand. The label/goto scheme uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_index">de Bruijn indices</a> to locally encode label names as integers.</p>



<p>The grammar, and this example, can be encoded in Rust like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Send</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>S</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>PhantomData</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>S</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;</span><span>);</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>Offer</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Left</span><span>,</span> <span>Right</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>PhantomData</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(</span><span>Left</span><span>,</span> <span>Right</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;</span><span>);</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>Z</span><span>;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>S</span><span>&lt;</span><span>N</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>PhantomData</span><span>&lt;</span><span>N</span><span>&gt;</span><span>);</span> <span>// Peano encoding for natural numbers</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Close</span><span>;</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>Ping</span><span>;</span>
<span>type</span> <span>PingServer</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>Label</span><span>&lt;</span>
    <span>Offer</span><span>&lt;</span>

        <span>Recv</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Ping</span><span>,</span>
        <span>Goto</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Z</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><span>,</span>
      <span>Close</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The runtime communication API uses the type-state concept as a channel whose type changes as the protocol advances. Initially, a <code>Chan</code> is created for the server and the client (the “dual” of the server). Here’s an example where the type annotations show the change.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>example_ping_server</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>c</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>):</span> <span>(</span><span>Chan</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(),</span> <span>PingServer</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
               <span>Chan</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(),</span> <span>Dual</span><span>&lt;</span><span>PingServer</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>Chan</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>c</span><span>:</span> <span>Chan</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(</span><span>Offer</span><span>&lt;</span><span>_</span><span>,</span><span>_</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>()),</span> <span>Offer</span><span>&lt;</span><span>_</span><span>,</span><span>_</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>c</span><span>.label</span><span>();</span>
  <span>loop</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>match</span> <span>c</span><span>.offer</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>Branch</span><span>::</span><span>Left</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>c</span><span>:</span> <span>Chan</span><span>&lt;</span><span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>Recv</span><span>&lt;</span><span>_</span><span>,</span><span>_</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>c</span><span>.send</span><span>(</span><span>Ping</span><span>);</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>c</span><span>,</span> <span>Ping</span><span>):</span> <span>(</span><span>Chan</span><span>&lt;</span><span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>Goto</span><span>&lt;</span><span>_</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>c</span><span>.recv</span><span>();</span>
        <span>c</span><span>.goto</span><span>()</span>
      <span>},</span>
      <span>Branch</span><span>::</span><span>Right</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>c</span><span>.close</span><span>();</span>

      <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that the <code>Chan</code> has two type arguments: an environment <code>Env</code> and a current action <code>Sigma</code>. The environment contains a list of session types generated by calls to <code>label</code>. When we <code>goto</code>, we look up the corresponding type in the <code>Env</code> list and …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week I made a <a href="https://leoloso.com/posts/proposal-for-embeddable-fields-in-graphql-query/">proposal to add embeddable fields to GraphQL</a>, but it didn't get a lot of support. I got the feedback that the extra complexity added to the server doesn't justify the benefits of this new feature, as in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/graphql/comments/j043rw/proposal_for_embeddable_fields_in_graphql/g6pvqcj">this comment on Reddit</a> (which I replied to through <a href="https://leoloso.com/posts/justifying-embeddable-fields-in-graphql-query/">this post</a>).</p><p>My proposed feature then appears to be not about GraphQL as we know it nowadays, but about an über GraphQL, or what GraphQL could possibly be. That's either a problem, or an opportunity. In <a href="https://artsy.github.io/blog/2018/05/08/is-graphql-the-future/">this write-up</a>, Alan Johnson says:</p><blockquote><p>[...] the execution model of GraphQL is in many ways just like a scripting language interpreter. The limitations of its model are strategic, to keep the technology focused on client-server interaction. What's interesting is that you as a developer provide nearly all of the definition of what operations exist, what they mean, and how they compose. For this reason, I consider GraphQL to be a <strong>meta-scripting language</strong>, or, in other words, a toolkit for building scripting languages.</p></blockquote><p>I agree with this observation, but then I wonder: Where do these limitations start? What should be allowed, and what not? If any feature made GraphQL's scripting capabilities a bit more visible, gave a bit more control to the developer, and made the query a bit more powerful, should that be straightforward rejected? Or could it be given a chance?</p><h2 id="heading-show-me-the-stuff!">Show me the stuff!<a href="#heading-show-me-the-stuff!"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>Let's talk business now. Here is something that GraphQL is not good at.</p><p>Say that you have a <code>@translate</code> directive that is applied on a <code>String</code>, as in <a href="https://newapi.getpop.org/graphiql/?query=query%20%7B%0A%20%20posts%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20id%0A%20%20%20%20title%20%40translate(from%3A%20%22en%22%2C%20to%3A%20%22es%22)%0A%20%20%7D%0A%7D">this query</a>:</p><pre><code><span><span>{</span></span><br><span>  posts <span>{</span></span><br><span>    id</span><br><span>    title <span>@translate</span><span>(</span><span>from</span><span>:</span> <span>"en"</span><span>,</span> <span>to</span><span>:</span> <span>"es"</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>  <span>}</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>You cannot apply <code>@translate</code> on a field different than a <code>String</code>. If you need to, you must then create a new directive, which involves extra effort (often being ad-hoc) and pollutes the schema:</p><ul><li><p>If a field returns <code>[String]</code>, you'd need to create another directive <code>@translateArrays</code></p></li><li><p>If only some entries from the array must be translated, you need to add an optional argument <code>$keys: [String]</code> to specify which keys to translate</p></li><li><p>If the keys are not strings, but are numeric, you need another argument <code>$numericKeys: [Int]</code> as to avoid type conflicts</p></li><li><p>If instead of an array, you get an array of arrays, you need yet another directive</p></li></ul><p>And so on, concerning any random requirement from your clients.</p><p>As a result, the schema might eventually become unwieldy.</p><hr><p>So, how could this situation be improved for GraphQL?</p><p>If GraphQL had capabilities to compose or manipulate fields, then a few elements could already satisfy

														<p><strong>The Struggle with China is not a Replay of the Cold War</strong><br>
Remarks to the Asia American Forum</p>
<p>Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. (USFS, Ret.)<br>
Visiting Scholar, Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, Brown University&lt;<br>
By video link from Washington, D.C., 25 September 2020</p>
<p>Washington has declared war on China.&nbsp; The administration and its allies hope that the war will be “cold,” but have no strategy for keeping it so.&nbsp; I find it noteworthy that the most belligerently anti-Chinese members of the current U.S. Senate are also its youngest.&nbsp; They came to adulthood after the end of the post-World War II “Cold War” and have no experience of its anxieties.&nbsp; They appear to take its sudden end as predestined – something that was so inevitably right ideologically that it can and should be taken for granted.&nbsp; Their military experience, if any, has been in the contemporary equivalent of the 19<sup>th</sup> century’s Indian Wars – combat with gun-toting farmers with no air forces, air defenses, navies, guided missiles, or nuclear weapons with which to answer U.S. hostility. &nbsp;To paraphrase Hilaire Belloc’s riff on Britain’s hubris in its colonial wars:</p>
<p>“Whatever happens, we have got<br>
Close air support and they have not.”</p>
<p>The Cold War was radically different from this.&nbsp; It was a global struggle between two competing ideological blocs and nuclear-armed power centers capable of destroying not just each other but all life on the planet except maybe the cockroaches.&nbsp; It began as a series of squabbles over the spoils of a worldwide war.&nbsp; Each side strove to consolidate spheres of politico-military and economic influence and deny the other access to them.&nbsp; But each learned to avoid confrontations that might lead to armed combat directly with the other.&nbsp; Each limited itself to proxy wars aimed at sustaining or imposing its ideology somewhere not in the grip of the other.&nbsp; Each sought to minimize and contain interaction with the other.&nbsp; That was not difficult, given the utter lack of interdependence between the two and the blocs of nations they formally and informally commanded.</p>
<p>The struggle we Americans have now initiated with China has none of these characteristics.&nbsp; To analogize it to the Cold War of 1947 – 1991 is intellectually lazy.&nbsp; More important, it is profoundly misleading and delusional.&nbsp; The Sino-American split is not the sequel to a bloody world war.&nbsp; However politically convenient it may be for Americans to cast antagonism to China in all-encompassing Manichean terms, this is a contest born of contending national self-images and ambitions, not ideologies.&nbsp; The struggle with China on which Americans have embarked is a bilateral contest in which others may or may not choose to take sides, not one between two committed blocs of nations.&nbsp; China is both a much less inherently hostile and far more robust rival than the Soviet Union was.</p>
<p>Emulating China’s autocracy by closing America to foreign goods, services, people, and ideas, as the United States is now doing, is self-defeating.&nbsp; Modeling China policy on Ronald Reagan’s treatment of the USSR before he met Mikhail Gorbachev, as Secretary of State Pompeo has done, is the path to receipt of a national “Darwin award.”&nbsp; The U.S. contention with a resurgent China cannot be conducted in the same manner as the Cold War.&nbsp; It will not end, as the Cold War did, with the voluntary resignation of an ideologically disillusioned and exhausted adversary.</p>
<p>Before I discuss China and how our contest with it is likely to proceed, it may be useful to spend a minute or two on what China is <u>not</u>.</p>
<p>In Chinese literature, there is a beast called a 四不像that is satirically defined by the “four things it ain’t.” &nbsp;The head and face of a “four ain’t<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>” is slender like a horse, but it ain’t a horse.&nbsp; Its horns are like a deer’s, but different.&nbsp; Its neck is like a camel’s, but it is no camel.&nbsp; Its tail is like a donkey’s, but it’s not an ass. &nbsp;The point is that describing a “four ain’t” by reference to previously encountered animals it does not resemble is worse than no help at all in understanding and dealing with it.</p>
<p>China is the “four ain’t” of today’s geopolitics.&nbsp; It is ruled by a “Communist Party” but is an overachieving participant in global capitalism, committed to free trade, expanded foreign investment, and a market economy guided by industrial policy, not central planning. &nbsp;China is armed with nuclear weapons, but it has sized and configured its arsenal for a retaliatory response to an attack on it by other nuclear powers, not for a first strike, which it has abjured and is not equipped to conduct.&nbsp; China is a threat to American global primacy, but mostly in economic and technological rather than political or military terms, in which it remains decidedly inferior.&nbsp; China is once again the immovable economic and cultural center of its native region – where the United States has for seventy-five years been the resident overlord – but China seeks no “allies” and has no political satrapies or military dependencies.</p>
<p>Crucially, <strong>China is not the Soviet Union</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>China has no messianic ideology to export. Its appeal derives from its performance, not its ideas.&nbsp; It is happy to be emulated, but justly charged with callous indifference to how foreign societies govern themselves.</li>
<li>China is not engaged in regime change operations to create an ideological sphere of influence. It seeks to prevent the overthrow of its own authoritarian system of governance but does not oppose democracy or promote authoritarianism abroad.&nbsp; Where tested, as in Korea, it often has a better relationship with democracies than with their undemocratic opponents.</li>
<li>China’s relationships with foreign nations are transactional rather than sentimental. It has no “satellites,” “allies,” or entente partners to divert its attention from its own defense. &nbsp;Beijing has no ideological soul mates, committed followers, or dedicated sycophants abroad.</li>
<li>China’s economy dwarfs that of the USSR. It accounts for 30 percent of global manufacturing and continues to grow.&nbsp; China has an economy that is almost one-third larger than that of the United States in purchasing power terms and that is rapidly approaching parity at nominal exchange rates.</li>
<li>China is now the largest consumer market on the planet and the biggest trading partner of three-fourths of the world’s other economies. It is fully integrated into the global capitalist system and cannot be walled off from it.</li>
<li>China already possesses one-fourth of the world’s scientific, technological, engineering, and mathematics workforce. It is steadily increasing its ascendancy.</li>
<li>China’s “Belt and Road Initiative” is an order-setting geoeconomic strategy with no Soviet parallel that dwarfs the nearest American equivalent – the Marshall Plan.</li>
<li>China spends two percent or less of GDP on its military vs. the estimated 9 – 15 percent of the USSR and the current 7.9 percent spent by the United States.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> Unlike the USSR, if pushed to do so, China has the capacity to more than match any U.S. military spending increases.</li>
<li>Despite much wishful thinking on the part of its detractors, premising a policy on China’s collapse from systemic defects, as George Kennan shrewdly did in the case of the USSR in 1947, is – on the evidence – delusional.</li>
<li>China has not built a nuclear arsenal to match that of either the United States or Russia. It has instead adopted a “no first use” policy for nuclear weapons backed by a modest <em>force de frappe</em> that can conduct a limited but devastating retaliatory counterstrike to any foreign nuclear attack on it.</li>
<li>There are no U.S. arms control agreements, exchanges of information, understandings on mutual restraint, or escalation control mechanisms between the U.S. and Chinese armed forces as there were with the USSR</li>
<li>American military intervention in the Russian civil war lasted only two years (1918-1920). Overt U.S. intervention in China’s ongoing civil war, sparked by the Korean War, began in 1950.&nbsp; Seventy years later, U.S. support for the heirs to Chiang Kai-shek’s defeated Chinese regime not only continues but is escalating.</li>
<li>The United States backs challenges to China’s sovereignty over Taiwan and islets in its near seas. By contrast, despite rhetorical opposition to its incorporation of the three Baltic states, America never actively contested the USSR’s territorial integrity.</li>
<li>The armed forces of the United States aggressively patrol China’s shorelines and test its defenses, as they did those of the Soviet Union. But, so far, unlike the USSR, China has not reciprocated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Equally important, <strong>the United States of the 2020s is not the America of the early Cold War</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>As the Cold War began, the United States produced one-half or more of the world’s manufactures. It now makes about one-sixth.</li>
<li>For the first time in American history, foreigners do not envy American freedoms. Once almost-universal admiration for the United States has been overwritten by repeated displays of racism, gun violence, political venality, xenophobia, and – most recently – executive incompetence and legislative default in the face of national challenges.&nbsp; No one abroad now seeks to emulate the U.S. political system or believes that the United States illustrates the possibilities of democracy.</li>
<li>During the Cold War, the United States was the uncontested leader of a bloc of dependent nations that it called “the free world.” That bloc is now in an advanced state of decay.&nbsp; America’s international followership is greatly diminished and its capacity to organize coalitions that integrate lesser powers in support of common objectives has atrophied.</li>
<li>Legacy U.S. alliances formed to contain the USSR have little relevance to American contention with China:
<ul>
<li>US-European alliances like NATO are withering. Though cautious about China, Europeans do not and will not support an effort to “contain” it.</li>
<li>No Asian security partner of the United States wants to choose between America and China.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> S. “alliances” in Asia embody U.S. undertakings to protect partners …</li></ul></li></ul></div></div>

		<p>After spending part of the last 12 months <a href="https://blog.luap.info/travelling-with-24-monitors.html">travelling in Europe</a> I'm now settling down around Paris and I need to adapt my multi-screens setup.</p>
<p>You probably have seen an ads for <a href="https://altwork.com/">the altwork desk</a> <em>a $7000 desk that let you work laying down</em>. Spending a big part of my day in front of a computer I want to have the most comfortable position as possible, but well $7000 + $1000 for the delivery seems so expensive. There is also <a href="http://www.ergoquest.com/">this company</a> but this is still about $4000 all included. Let's be creative and build it myself.</p>
<p>Here is the result</p>
<p><img alt="complete desk" src="https://blog.luap.info/drafts/static/desk/complete.jpg"> </p>
<p>The things I have to take into account are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I have three monitors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have no diy tools</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want a laying down position</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This should be easy to use</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This should be light and not take too much space</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have only a bike to move the parts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I haven't found anyone who has done something similar and so don't really have examples</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So instead of doing the waterfall way I decided to go the agile way and to not do any plans, I didn't know what to expect, so let's do it step by step and see how it goes</p>
<h2>Take care of the chair</h2>
<p>There are several options:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Built a chair from scratch including the 'mattress' part</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a reclined chair</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adapt a chair</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The issue with the first option is that I will not be sure of the result, is it going to be comfortable ? How I'm going to wash the seat covers ? I have no idea of the things to take into account for building a comfortable chair.</p>
<p>Reclined chairs are great but they are very heavy (except the garden ones but not very comfortable) and expensive. So again let's be creative, I got inspired by <a href="https://www.ikeahackers.net/2017/04/poang-gravity-recliner.html">this</a> and <a href="https://www.ikeahackers.net/2020/04/remove-poang-arms.html">this</a> ikea hacks which use a IKEA POANG chair and transform it into a reclined chair.</p>
<p>Here is the result :</p>
<p><img alt="ikea poang adaptation" src="https://blog.luap.info/drafts/static/desk/chair.jpg"></p>
<p>The chair is 69 euro, I had to buy three cushions to extend it</p>
<p>The most complex part was to do 7km with the chair on a bike. I do not recommend doing the same, particularly because I have done it on a rainy day but well a bit of challenge in my life is always welcome!</p>
<p><img alt="ikea bike" src="https://blog.luap.info/drafts/static/desk/ikea_bike.jpg"></p>
<p>Great, the chair is comfortable, let's do something for the desk part.</p>
<h2>What structure for the desk</h2>
<p>The biggest issue you are going to have with the lay down position, is that the desk is going to be on your legs and you cant 'enter' or 'leave' the desk if you can't move the desk. So you need the 'desk' part to be dynamic from the 'chair' part.</p>
<p>I had two ideas for that, either the Altwork way, the structure goes above your head and can incline, or the the base is on the side and the desk can move somewhere (writing that, having the desk in front of me, I wonder if having the base where the foot are is not an even better solution ? Damn, too late). Having the base on the side seems better because it would be smaller and lighter and also you can balance the weight much better. But the structure also needs to be more rigid and I need to find a way to incline the desk, anyway I haven't found a way to do it :(, after a night of thinking I went the altwork way.</p>
<p>There are two parts to design:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The base + the incline system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The desk + the screen supports</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>1. Base + incline system</h3>
<p>The base is pretty standard, you need something strong enough so that it can suppot the whole thing. At that point I still didn't know the weight of the complete platform so I didn't know how strong it should be. After a few failing choices, I ended up with a main pole of 7cm x 7cm.</p>
<p>Now the complex part, how to design the rotation part ? How heavy is going to be the rest of desk ? How much does the desk need to move so that I can 'enter' the desk ? So many questions I didnt have an answer for.</p>
<p>So let's try something and see how it goes, I bought an <a href="https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B00H8SZ87W">gaz actuator on Amazon</a> which can support 70kg with a range of 31cm, it is built for cars and pretty cheap, 19euro. Actually 70kg is a lot. So at least I have a some freedom on the weight of the structure.</p>
<p>I had two issues with the actuator:</p>
<ul>
<li>70kg IS A LOT, it is so much that when I was fixing it on the wood of the base, it was breaking the wood. The best would be to have an iron piece that I can fix to the wood but I didnt have the tools for that so I used stronger woods but this is still fragile. </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="fixation verrin" src="https://blog.luap.info/drafts/static/desk/fixation_verrin.jpg"></p>
<ul>
<li>The desk follows a circular trajectory when you move it up and down. As a result the barycenter of the structure changes depending on the Y position of the 'desk part' and so there is more strength applied on the actuator when it is up than when it is down. So basically the desk will not stay by itself when in the up position.  I need to find a way to get the desk in the up position.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not really proud of the way I've done it, but it somewhat works. I've built a piece of wood that inserts itself in the area between the two poles where the actuator is. There is a counterweight which drags the piece into the zone when in up position, and when I want to release it, I just need to pull on the rope. (I think I will replace the actuator with a real electric actuator when the current system breaks so that I can control the movement, it is about 120euro)</p>
<p><img alt="system block" src="https://blog.luap.info/drafts/static/desk/blocking_system.jpg"></p>
<h3>2. Desk + screens support</h3>
<p>I bought a chipboard plate of 80cm x 120cm, and cut some space for my body</p>
<p><img alt="plaque bois" src="https://blog.luap.info/drafts/static/desk/agglo.jpg"> </p>
<p>This is pretty solid, so I can directly screw this plate to the pole and we have a desk surface</p>
<p><img alt="plaque bureau" src="https://blog.luap.info/drafts/static/desk/bureau_with_plaque.jpg"></p>
<p>For holding the monitors I did something pretty basic, I created a box for each screen. Then comes the position of the screen, how to know the position of each screen ? I didnt know how to know it beforehand, so I just created dynamic arms and adjusted them while in front of the screens</p>
<p><img alt="support monitor" src="https://blog.luap.info/drafts/static/desk/support_monitor.jpg"></p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>This is only a few days old so I can't really make a feedback but there are already a few things that I need to fix</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I can't use a mouse anymore, as the mouse would fall down, I'm probably going to replace it by a trackball</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I need to invest in an ergonomic keyboard to get really comfortable, probably going to buy the kenesis advantage 2, but this is expensive !</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a video of the complete desk:</p>
<video controls="">

</video>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>When you want to build this kind of structure, I'm not sure you can plan everything beforehand, there are always things that will happen that you didn't expect, like when you code: if you want to modify the actuator when the 60kg setup is mounted how do you do ? (I have done it 6 times) When your base can't support the weight because it lacks one screw and you need to unmount everything what do you do ? ...</p>
<p>I'm really annoyed by the actuator part, I hope I will find something more reliable</p>
<p>Overall it cost me :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>45 euro for tools</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>130 euro for wood pieces, screws, joins, ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>110 euro for the IKEA chair + cushions</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and I spent 26 hours working, excluding the transport and the time shopping for pieces</p>
<p>Don't forget when you do woodworking to clean afterwards  :)</p>

<p>PS: If you wonder whether you can do that or not, everyone can do it, basic woodworking is not complex, you need to know how to cut wood, how to join wood, how to screw and a little bit of imagination, you dont even need a car to transport parts, I transported everything: pole of 2m40, big plate ... on a bike</p>

		<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_numbers">Very big numbers</a> like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham's_number">Graham’s Number</a> are often expressed with lengthy, clumsy, semi formal explanations. But it’s concise and&nbsp;convenient to express such numbers precisely in the pure <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">lambda calculus</a>, using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding">Church numerals</a>. Starting with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth's_up-arrow_notation">Knuth’s up-arrow</a>, if we define <em>f<sub>n,a</sub></em>(<em>b</em>) = <em>a</em>↑<sup><em>n</em></sup><em>b</em>, then <em>f<sub>0,a</sub></em>(<em>b</em>) = <em>ab</em> and <em>f<sub>n+1,a</sub></em>(<em>b</em>) = <em>f<sub>n,a</sub></em><sup><em>b</em></sup>(1). From this we get that the lambda expression <strong>upify</strong> = λ<em>f b</em>. <em>b f</em> <strong>1</strong> yields <em>f<sub>n+1,a</sub></em> given <em>f<sub>n,a</sub></em>, and so <strong>uparrow</strong> = λ<em>n a b</em>. <em>n</em> <strong>upify</strong> (<strong>times</strong> <em>a</em>) <em>b. </em>A similar process yield’s Graham’s Number, given that <em>G = f<sup>64</sup></em>(4) where <em>f</em>(<em>n</em>) = 3↑<sup><em>n</em></sup>3:</p>
<p><strong>1</strong> = λ<em>f x</em>.&nbsp;<em>f x</em><br>
<strong>2</strong> = λ<em>f x</em>. <em>f</em> (<em>f x</em>)<br>
<strong>3</strong> = λ<em>f x</em>. <em>f</em> (<em>f</em> (<em>f x</em>))<br>
<strong>4</strong> = <strong>2 2</strong><br>
<strong>64</strong> = <strong>3 4</strong></p>
<p><strong>times</strong> = λ<em>a b f</em>. <em>a</em> (<em>b f</em>)<br>
<strong>upify</strong> = λ<em>f b</em>. <em>b f</em> <strong>1</strong><br>
<strong>uparrow</strong> = λ<em>n a b</em>. <em>n</em> <strong>upify</strong> (<strong>times</strong> <em>a</em>) <em>b</em><br>
<strong>grahamf</strong> = λ<em>n</em>. <strong>uparrow</strong> <em>n</em> <strong>3 3</strong><br>
<strong>graham</strong> =<strong> 64</strong> <strong>grahamf</strong> <strong>4</strong></p>
<p>Putting it all together:</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong> = (λ<em>c2 c3</em>.(λ<em>c4</em>.<em> c3 c4 </em>(λ<em>n</em>.<em> n </em>(λ<em>f b</em>.<em> b f </em>(λ<em>x</em>.<em> x</em>)) (λ<em>b f</em>.<em> c3 </em>(<em>b f</em>))<em> c3</em>)<em> c4</em>) (<em>c2 c2</em>)) (λ<em>f x</em>.<em> f </em>(<em>f x</em>)) (λ<em>f x</em>.<em> f </em>(<em>f </em>(<em>f x</em>)))</p>
<p>In <a href="https://tromp.github.io/cl/cl.html">John Tromp’s “binary lambda calculus”</a>, this expression takes up&nbsp; 120 bits—exactly as many bits, as Doug Clow points out below, as the string “Graham’s Number” in Unicode. Don’t try evaluating this in your favourite lambda calculus interpreter unless you’re very, very patient.</p>
<p>Updated 2020-02-20:&nbsp; I blogged about a beautiful way to see this as a&nbsp;<a href="https://mindsarentmagic.org/2020/02/19/a-picture-of-grahams-number/">picture</a>.</p>

<p>
In this article, we're only measuring the performance on the CPU. Both libraries,
Deep Diamond, and Keras with TensorFlow use <a href="https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDNN">Intel's oneDNN</a> low level performance
library under the hood, and I confirmed that both installations exploit AVX2 instructions that are
available on my (old-ish) CPU i7-4790k, so the difference is completely due to the higher-level implementations.
</p>

<p>
Deep Diamond completes this training in <b>368</b> seconds while Keras + TensorFlow takes <b>509</b> seconds.
</p>

<p>
TensorFlow is not famous for being the fastest deep learning library, but
keep in mind that that info is from the times before they integrated
Intel's oneDNN. Now that all major frameworks have oneDNN support,
the underlying performance is usually on more equal footing.
</p>

<p>
That's why this result is good. Even though all high performance
operations are backed by the same native operations, Keras + TensoFlow
still add 140 seconds of overhead, almost 50% to Deep Diamond's running time. Not bad!
</p>

<p>
I know what you'll complain about: "Nobody trains their networks on
CPU anyway. The GPU performance is what is relevant! Clojure certainly
can't challenge TensorFlow there?" You're right about the first part;
GPU performance is much more relevant. Let's keep the suspense then,
until the next article, which will compare Deep Diamond to Keras + TensorFlow on the GPU with CUDA.

            <p>
    Posted on May 11, 2019
</p>



<p>This post demonstrates a simple encoding of a (typed) concatenative language in Haskell.</p>
<p>Point-free style is one of the distinctive markers of functional programming languages. Want to sum a list? That’s as easy as:</p>

<p>Now I want to sum every number after adding one to it.</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1">sumSuccs <span>=</span> <span>foldr</span> (<span>+</span>) <span>0</span> <span>.</span> <span>map</span> ((<span>+</span>) <span>1</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>One more step to make this function truly abstract™ and general™: we’ll allow the user to supply their own number to add</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1">sumAdded <span>=</span> <span>foldr</span> (<span>+</span>) <span>0</span> <span>.</span> <span>map</span> <span>.</span> (<span>+</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And here the trouble begins. The above expression won’t actually type check. In fact, it’ll give a pretty terrible error message:</p>
<pre><code>• Non type-variable argument in the constraint: Num [a]
  (Use FlexibleContexts to permit this)
• When checking the inferred type
    sumThoseThat :: forall a.
                    (Num [a], Foldable ((-&gt;) [a])) =&gt;
                    a -&gt; [a]</code></pre>
<p>I remember as a beginner being confused by similar messages. What’s <code>FlexibleContexts</code>? I had thought that the “point-free style” just meant removing the last variable from an expression if it’s also the last argument:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>sum</span> xs <span>=</span> <span>foldr</span> (<span>+</span>) <span>0</span> xs</span>
<span id="cb5-2"><span>sum</span> <span>=</span> <span>foldr</span> (<span>+</span>) <span>0</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Why doesn’t it work here?</p>
<p>Well, it doesn’t work because the types don’t line up, but I’m going to try and explain a slightly different perspective on the problem, which is <em>associativity</em>.</p>
<p>To make it a little clearer, let’s see what happens when we point-fill the expression:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1">sumAdded n xs <span>=</span> (<span>foldr</span>(<span>+</span>) <span>0</span> <span>.</span> (<span>map</span> <span>.</span> (<span>+</span>))) n xs</span>
<span id="cb6-2">             <span>=&gt;</span> <span>foldr</span>(<span>+</span>) <span>0</span> ((<span>map</span> <span>.</span> (<span>+</span>)) n) xs</span>
<span id="cb6-3">             <span>=&gt;</span> <span>foldr</span>(<span>+</span>) <span>0</span> (<span>map</span> ((<span>+</span>) n)) xs</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Indeed, the problem is the placement of the parentheses. What we want at the end is:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1">             <span>=&gt;</span> <span>foldr</span>(<span>+</span>) <span>0</span> (<span>map</span> ((<span>+</span>) n) xs)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But, no matter. We have to jiggle the arguments around, or we could use something terrible like this:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><span>infixr</span> <span>9</span> <span>.:</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2">(<span>.:</span>) <span>=</span> (<span>.</span>)<span>.</span>(<span>.</span>)</span>
<span id="cb8-3"></span>
<span id="cb8-4">sumAdded <span>=</span> <span>foldr</span> (<span>+</span>) <span>0</span> <span>.:</span> <span>map</span> <span>.</span> (<span>+</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Is there something, though, that could do this automatically?</p>

<p>We run into a similar problem in Agda. We’re forever having to prove statements like:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>(</span>x + y<span>)</span> + z ≡ x + <span>(</span>y + z<span>)</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2">x ≡ x + <span>0</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are a couple of ways to get around the issue, and for monoids there’s a rich theory of techniques. I’ll just show one for now, which relies on the <em>endomorphism</em> monoid. This monoid is created by partially applying the monoid’s binary operator:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1">Endo <span>:</span> <span>Set</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2">Endo <span>=</span> ℕ <span>→</span> ℕ</span>
<span id="cb10-3"></span>
<span id="cb10-4">⟦<span>_</span>⇑⟧ <span>:</span> ℕ <span>→</span> Endo</span>
<span id="cb10-5">⟦ n ⇑⟧ m <span>=</span> n + m</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And you can get back to the underlying monoid by applying it to the neutral element:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1">⟦<span>_</span>⇓⟧ <span>:</span> Endo <span>→</span> ℕ</span>
<span id="cb11-2">⟦ n ⇓⟧ <span>=</span> n <span>0</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here’s the important parts: first, we can lift the underlying operation into the endomorphism:</p>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1"><span>_</span>⊕<span>_</span> <span>:</span> Endo <span>→</span> Endo <span>→</span> Endo</span>
<span id="cb12-2">xs ⊕ ys <span>=</span> <span>λ</span> x <span>→</span> xs <span>(</span>ys x<span>)</span></span>
<span id="cb12-3"></span>
<span id="cb12-4">⊕-homo <span>:</span> <span>∀</span> n m <span>→</span> ⟦ ⟦ n ⇑⟧ ⊕ ⟦ m ⇑⟧ ⇓⟧ ≡ n + m</span>
<span id="cb12-5">⊕-homo n m <span>=</span> cong <span>(</span>n +<span>_)</span> <span>(</span>+-identityʳ m<span>)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>And second, it’s <em>definitionally</em> associative.</p>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1">⊕-assoc <span>:</span> <span>∀</span> x y z <span>→</span> <span>(</span>x ⊕ y<span>)</span> ⊕ z ≡ x ⊕ <span>(</span>y ⊕ z<span>)</span></span>
<span id="cb13-2">⊕-assoc <span>_</span> <span>_</span> <span>_</span> <span>=</span> refl</span></code></pre></div>
<p>These are all clues as to how to solve the composition problem in the Haskell code above. We need definitional associativity, somehow. Maybe we can get it from the endomorphism monoid?</p>

<p>You’re probably familiar with Haskell’s state monad:</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1"><span>newtype</span> <span>State</span> s a <span>=</span> <span>State</span> {<span> runState ::</span> s <span>-&gt;</span> (a, s) }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It can help a lot when you’re threading around fiddly accumulators and so on.</p>
<div id="cb15"><pre><code><span id="cb15-1"><span>nub ::</span> <span>Ord</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span>
<span id="cb15-2">nub <span>=</span> go Set.empty</span>
<span id="cb15-3">  <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb15-4">    go seen [] <span>=</span> []</span>
<span id="cb15-5">    go seen (x<span>:</span>xs)</span>
<span id="cb15-6">      <span>|</span> x <span>`Set.member`</span> seen <span>=</span> go seen xs</span>
<span id="cb15-7">      <span>|</span> <span>otherwise</span> <span>=</span> x <span>:</span> go (Set.insert x seen) xs</span></code></pre></div>
<div id="cb16"><pre><code><span id="cb16-1"><span>nub ::</span> <span>Ord</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span>
<span id="cb16-2">nub <span>=</span> <span>flip</span> evalState Set.empty <span>.</span> go</span>
<span id="cb16-3">  <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb16-4">    go [] <span>=</span> <span>pure</span> []</span>
<span id="cb16-5">    go (x<span>:</span>xs) <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb16-6">        seen <span>&lt;-</span> gets (Set.member x)</span>
<span id="cb16-7">        <span>if</span> seen</span>
<span id="cb16-8">          <span>then</span> go xs</span>
<span id="cb16-9">          <span>else</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb16-10">              modify (Set.insert x)</span>
<span id="cb16-11">              (x<span>:</span>) <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> go xs</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Of course, these days state is a transformer:</p>
<div id="cb17"><pre><code><span id="cb17-1"><span>newtype</span> <span>StateT</span> s m a <span>=</span> <span>StateT</span> {<span> runStateT ::</span> s <span>-&gt;</span> m (a, s) }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This lets us stack multiple effects on top of each other: error handling, IO, randomness, even another state monad. In fact, if you <em>do</em> stack another state monad on top, you might be surprised by the efficiency of the code it generates:</p>
<div id="cb18"><pre><code><span id="cb18-1"><span>type</span> <span>DoubleState</span> s1 s2 a <span>=</span> <span>StateT</span> s1 (<span>State</span> s2) a</span>
<span id="cb18-2">                        <span>=&gt;</span> s1 <span>-&gt;</span> <span>State</span> s2 (a, s1)</span>
<span id="cb18-3">                        <span>=&gt;</span> s1 <span>-&gt;</span> s2 <span>-&gt;</span> ((a, s1), s2)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It’s nothing earth shattering, but it inlines and optimises well. That output is effectively a left-nested list, also.</p>

<p>If we can do one, and we can do two, why not more? Can we generalise the state pattern to an arbitrary number of variables? First we’ll need a generic tuple:</p>
<div id="cb19"><pre><code><span id="cb19-1"><span>infixr</span> <span>5</span> <span>:-</span></span>
<span id="cb19-2"><span>data</span> <span>Stack</span> (<span>xs ::</span> [<span>Type</span>])<span> ::</span> <span>Type</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb19-3">    <span>Nil</span><span>  ::</span> <span>Stack</span> '[]</span>
<span id="cb19-4"><span>    (:-) ::</span> x <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Stack</span> xs <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Stack</span> (x <span>:</span> xs)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then, the state type.</p>
<div id="cb20"><pre><code><span id="cb20-1"><span>newtype</span> <span>State</span> xs a <span>=</span> <span>State</span> {<span> runState ::</span> <span>Stack</span> xs <span>-&gt;</span> (a, <span>Stack</span> xs) }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can actually clean the definition up a little: instead of a tuple at the other end, why not push it onto the stack.</p>
<div id="cb21"><pre><code><span id="cb21-1"><span>newtype</span> <span>State</span> xs a <span>=</span> <span>State</span> {<span> runState ::</span> <span>Stack</span> xs <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Stack</span> (a <span>:</span> xs) }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In fact, let’s make this as polymorphic as possible. We should be able to change the state is we so desire.</p>
<div id="cb22"><pre><code><span id="cb22-1"><span>infixr</span> <span>0</span> <span>:-&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb22-2"><span>type</span> (<span>:-&gt;</span>) xs ys <span>=</span> <span>Stack</span> xs <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Stack</span> ys</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And suddenly, our endomorphism type from above shows up again.</p>
<p>We can, of course, get back our original types.</p>
<div id="cb23"><pre><code><span id="cb23-1"><span>newtype</span> <span>State</span> xs a <span>=</span> <span>State</span> {<span> runState ::</span> xs <span>:-&gt;</span> a <span>:</span> xs }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And it comes with all of the instances you might expect:</p>
<div id="cb24"><pre><code><span id="cb24-1"><span>instance</span> <span>Functor</span> (<span>State</span> xs) <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb24-2">    <span>fmap</span> f xs <span>=</span> <span>State</span> (\s <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> runState xs s <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb24-3">        (x <span>:-</span> ys) <span>-&gt;</span> f x <span>:-</span> ys)</span>
<span id="cb24-4">        </span>
<span id="cb24-5"><span>instance</span> <span>Applicative</span> (<span>State</span> xs) <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb24-6">    <span>pure</span> x <span>=</span> <span>State</span> (x <span>:-</span>)</span>
<span id="cb24-7">    fs <span>&lt;*&gt;</span> xs <span>=</span> <span>State</span> (\s <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> runState fs s <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb24-8">        (f <span>:-</span> s') <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> runState xs s' <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb24-9">            (x <span>:-</span> s'') <span>-&gt;</span> f x <span>:-</span> s'')</span>
<span id="cb24-10">            </span>
<span id="cb24-11"><span>instance</span> <span>Monad</span> (<span>State</span> xs) <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb24-12">    xs <span>&gt;&gt;=</span> f <span>=</span> <span>State</span> (\s <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> runState xs s <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb24-13">        y <span>:-</span> ys <span>-&gt;</span> runState (f y) ys)</span></code></pre></div>

<p>But what’s the point? So far we’ve basically just encoded an unnecessarily complicated state transformer. Think back to the stacking of states. Written in the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl">mtl</a> style, the main advantage of stacking monads like that is you can write code like the following:</p>
<div id="cb25"><pre><code><span id="cb25-1"><span>pop ::</span> (<span>MonadState</span> [a] m, <span>MonadError</span> <span>String</span> m) <span>=&gt;</span> m a</span>
<span id="cb25-2">pop <span>=</span> get <span>&gt;&gt;=</span> \<span>case</span></span>
<span id="cb25-3">    [] <span>-&gt;</span> throwError <span>"pop: empty list"</span></span>
<span id="cb25-4">    x<span>:</span>xs <span>-&gt;</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb25-5">        put xs </span>
<span id="cb25-6">        <span>pure</span> x</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In other words, we don’t care about the rest of <code>m</code>, we just care that it has, somewhere, state for an <code>[a]</code>.</p>
<p>This logic should apply to our stack transformer, as well. If it only cares about the top two variables, it shouldn’t care what the rest of the list is. In types:</p>
<div id="cb26"><pre><code><span id="cb26-1"><span>infixr</span> <span>0</span> <span>:-&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb26-2"><span>type</span> (<span>:-&gt;</span>) xs ys <span>=</span> <span>forall</span> zs<span>.</span> <span>Stack</span> (xs <span>++</span> zs) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Stack</span> (ys <span>++</span> zs)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And straight away we can write some of the standard combinators:</p>
<div id="cb27"><pre><code><span id="cb27-1"><span>dup ::</span> '[a] <span>:-&gt;</span> '[a,a]</span>
<span id="cb27-2">dup (x <span>:-</span> xs) <span>=</span> (x <span>:-</span> x <span>:-</span> xs)</span>
<span id="cb27-3"></span>
<span id="cb27-4"><span>swap ::</span> '[x,y] <span>:-&gt;</span> '[y,x]</span>
<span id="cb27-5">swap (x <span>:-</span> y <span>:-</span> xs) <span>=</span> y <span>:-</span> x <span>:-</span> xs</span>
<span id="cb27-6"></span>
<span id="cb27-7"><span>drop</span><span> ::</span> '[x,y] <span>:-&gt;</span> '[y]</span>
<span id="cb27-8"><span>drop</span> (_ <span>:-</span> xs) <span>=</span> xs</span>
<span id="cb27-9"></span>
<span id="cb27-10"><span>infixl</span> <span>9</span> <span>!</span></span>
<span id="cb27-11">(f <span>!</span> g) x <span>=</span> g (f x)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You’ll immediately run into trouble if you try to work with some of the more involved combinators, though. Quote should have the following type, for instance:</p>
<div id="cb28"><pre><code><span id="cb28-1"><span>quote ::</span> (xs <span>:-&gt;</span> ys) <span>-&gt;</span> '[] <span>:-&gt;</span> '[ xs <span>:-&gt;</span> ys ]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But GHC complains again:</p>
<pre><code>• Illegal polymorphic type: xs :-&gt; ys
  GHC doesn't yet support impredicative polymorphism
• In the type signature:
    quote :: (xs :-&gt; ys) -&gt; '[] :-&gt; '[xs :-&gt; ys]</code></pre>
<p>I won’t go into the detail of this particular error: if you’ve been around the block with Haskell you know that it means “wrap it in a newtype”. If we do <em>that</em>, though, we get yet more errors:</p>
<div id="cb30"><pre><code><span id="cb30-1"><span>newtype</span> (<span>:~&gt;</span>) xs ys <span>=</span> <span>Q</span> {<span> d ::</span> xs <span>:-&gt;</span> ys }</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>• Couldn't match type ‘ys ++ zs0’ with ‘ys ++ zs’
  Expected type: Stack (xs ++ zs) -&gt; Stack (ys ++ zs)
    Actual type: Stack (xs ++ zs0) -&gt; Stack (ys ++ zs0)
  NB: ‘++’ is a type function, and may not be injective</code></pre>
<p>This injectivity error comes up often. It means that GHC needs to prove that the input to two functions is equal, but it only knows that their outputs are. This is a doubly serious problem for us, as we can’t do type family injectivity on two type variables (in current Haskell). To solve the problem, we need to rely on a weird mishmash of type families and functional dependencies:</p>
<div id="cb32"><pre><code><span id="cb32-1"><span>type</span> <span>family</span> (<span>++</span>) xs ys <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb32-2">    '[] <span>++</span> ys <span>=</span> ys</span>
<span id="cb32-3">    (x <span>:</span> xs) <span>++</span> ys <span>=</span> x <span>:</span> (xs <span>++</span> ys)</span>
<span id="cb32-4">    </span>
<span id="cb32-5"><span>class</span> (xs <span>++</span> ys <span>~</span> zs) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Conc</span> xs ys zs <span>|</span> xs zs <span>-&gt;</span> ys <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb32-6"><span>    conc ::</span> <span>Stack</span> xs <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Stack</span> ys <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Stack</span> zs</span>
<span id="cb32-7">    </span>
<span id="cb32-8"><span>instance</span> <span>Conc</span> '[] ys ys <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb32-9">    conc _ ys <span>=</span> ys</span>
<span id="cb32-10">    </span>
<span id="cb32-11"><span>instance</span> <span>Conc</span> xs ys zs <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Conc</span> (x <span>:</span> xs) ys (x <span>:</span> zs) <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb32-12">    conc (x <span>:-</span> xs) ys <span>=</span> x <span>:-</span> conc xs ys</span>
<span id="cb32-13"></span>
<span id="cb32-14"><span>infixr</span> <span>0</span> <span>:-&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb32-15"><span>type</span> (<span>:-&gt;</span>) xs ys <span>=</span> <span>forall</span> zs yszs<span>.</span> <span>Conc</span> ys zs yszs <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Stack</span> (xs <span>++</span> zs) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Stack</span> yszs</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And it does indeed work:</p>
<div id="cb33"><pre><code><span id="cb33-1"><span>pure</span><span> ::</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> '[] <span>:-&gt;</span> '[a]</span>
<span id="cb33-2"><span>pure</span> <span>=</span> (<span>:-</span>)</span>
<span id="cb33-3"></span>
<span id="cb33-4"><span>newtype</span> (<span>:~&gt;</span>) xs ys <span>=</span> <span>Q</span> {<span> d ::</span> xs <span>:-&gt;</span> ys }</span>
<span id="cb33-5"></span>
<span id="cb33-6"><span>quote ::</span> (xs <span>:-&gt;</span> ys) <span>-&gt;</span> '[] <span>:-&gt;</span> '[ xs <span>:~&gt;</span> ys ]</span>

<span id="cb33-8"></span>

<span id="cb33-19">test <span>=</span> quote dup</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Interestingly, these combinators represent the monadic operations on state (<code>dot</code> = <code>join</code>, <code>pure</code> = <code>pure</code>, etc.)</p>
<p>And can we get the nicer composition of the function from the intro? Kind of:</p>
<div id="cb34"><pre><code><span id="cb34-1">sumAdded <span>=</span> quote add <span>!</span> <span>curry</span> <span>!</span> dot <span>!</span> <span>map</span> <span>!</span> <span>sum</span></span></code></pre></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <article>
    <p>I’m back from cryosleep. After <a href="https://www.eidel.io/2020/01/31/pioneers-vs-process-people/">leaving Merantix Healthcare</a> 7 months ago I haven’t
been writing much. I took the summer off to finish my pilot’s license and to try out a few things on the
side.</p>

<p>One of them was doing regulatory consulting for medical software startups. Remember: At Merantix Healthcare
(now: Vara), we managed to pass all regulatory hurdles to bring our Machine Learning - based Radiology
software to market. At the time I thought this was quite an unspectacular achievement, but apparently many
other companies fail at it.</p>

<p>So, shortly after becoming unemployed, random people started emailing me with requests like “Hey, work as a
consultant for us, we pay you money, start tomorrow”. I started calling it the <em>magical consulting business
with zero marketing</em>.</p>

<p>It’s not like I was keen to do it, but it was worth a try.</p>

<p>I approached it with an open mind. Half a year later, after having succesfully worked with four companies,
here’s my verdict: It sucks.</p>

<p>Why? Many reasons. But let’s take a step back first.</p>

<p>What is regulation? (Bear with me) in human language, <em>regulation</em> is a list of hoops some authority puts in
your way of accessing the market. Everyone in your industry has to jump through these hoops.</p>

<p>Here’s the thing: In a sane world, with rational people, we wouldn’t need any regulation. People would be
building perfectly safe software. Like, they wouldn’t write buggy code that crashes and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25" target="_blank">shoots high doses of
radiation at patients</a>.</p>

<p>Having perfect software is a utopic scenario. Software is never perfect. And even if most people build safe
stuff most of the time, just a small group of reckless individuals is enough to cause disaster.</p>

<p>That’s where regulation comes in. Regulation basically says: “Hey, this one company screwed up big time
recently, so from now on, every company has to comply with this list of things we came up with. Those measures
will surely prevent that from happening again!”.</p>

<p>And that sucks. Because what did we do? We took the maximum observed stupidity of our society (writing buggy
code that emits radiation) and now we <em>assume</em> that 1) everyone else is just as stupid and 2) that some rules
we came up with will prevent the problem in the future.</p>

<p>Let’s think about these assumptions.</p>

<h3 id="1-can-we-assume-everyone-to-be-stupid">1) Can We Assume Everyone to Be Stupid?</h3>

<p>Does it really sound like a good approach to subject everyone to the same standards? Standards which were
created based on the most incapable person, the <em>most-stupid-denominator</em>?</p>

<p>This reminds me of working at the office (good times). In any company, there are always some people who are
more messy than others. Or should we rather say: Less diligent. While you’re trying to write code, they have
loud phone calls on speakerphone. They enter your meeting room and don’t close the door. Sometimes they
“forget” to use the toilet brush after deploying a large payload.</p>

<p>Now, how do you deal with these problems? You have two options:</p>

<p>You talk to those people individually. This is not only the most discreet, but also the most effective
way. It’s also the hardest. At least for you: It takes courage to approach that person and deliver that sort
of message. But it’s the right thing to do.</p>

<p>The other option would be: You attempt to <em>generalize</em> the problem and solve it <em>generically</em> by establishing
new company policies. You put up a sign in the open office saying “No loud phones calls!”. On all meeting room
doors, you write “Please close the door”. And in each bathroom, you hang up a framed SOP for when to use the
toilet brush.</p>

<p>This is how large companies deal with those problems, and companies in which people don’t have the guts to
talk about problems one on one. It’s a cowardly and ineffective move. Guess what - the dude who has loud phone
calls will most likely not read a random sign on the wall. And all other people who were behaving perfectly
fine are now subjected to a barrage of useless signs which assume they’re utterly incompetent at breathing.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, regulation tries to solve problems in the same way.</p>

<p>Developers are expected to create hundreds of pages of documentation to prove that they’ve really tested
everything. They must write a development plan to ensure that they’re actually capable of developing whatever
they wanted to build (?). They have to make a list of their dependencies and test them (!).</p>

<p>If your development team is incompetent, forcing them to write a development plan won’t increase their code
quality. It only increases overhead.</p>

<p>Funnily enough, the same incompetent developers will pass all regulatory hurdles as long as they’re creating
the right documentation. A scary thought. Which leads me to the next question:</p>

<h3 id="2-will-our-rules-prevent-the-problem">2) Will Our Rules Prevent the Problem?</h3>

<p>Anyone who has ever observed complex systems knows: It’s hard to come up with interventions which actually
provide the desired outcome.</p>

<p>Say, your garden has snakes. You don’t like that because you want to sit on your patio and you’re scared of
snakes. So you put a honey badger there to chase away the snakes. Great, the snakes are gone. But now the
honey badger is settling down on your patio and has invited all his honey badger friends to hang out
there. Bad luck for you. A second order effect!</p>

<p>Is developing (medical) software a complex process? And, if so, can regulation be compared to a honey badger?
I think so.</p>

<p>We are introducing measures which we <em>assume</em> will improve things, because they were <em>associated</em> with certain
problems in the past. But in reality we don’t know if they were <em>causing</em> them. We just mixed up correlation
and causation.</p>

<p>It’s like observing people with Covid and saying “Aha! Those Covid patients are coughing! So let’s tell all
healthy people not to cough and they’ll be fine!”. Luckily our standards of medical science are better than
that. New treatments have to undergo clinical trials in which they must show an improvement in patient
outcome. Do our regulatory measures undergo similar testing? I’m not sure.</p>

<p>But one things <em>will</em> happen for sure: The list of hoops all future companies have to jump through just became
longer. And guess what? The useful time they can spend on developing their product has shrunk, again.</p>

<p>But here’s the worst part. After we’ve introduced our measures, software actually became safer. That leads us
to wrongly assume that <em>we chose the right measures</em> and <em>those measures caused improvements in safety</em>. But I
don’t think that’s true. Sure, we achieved our goal, but we don’t know <em>how</em>. Sounds like alchemy! A dangerous
situation.</p>

<p>I call these <em>second order effects of regulation</em>.</p>

<h2 id="second-order-effects">Second Order Effects?</h2>

<p>Do our regulatory measures <em>cause</em> us to develop safer software? Or are we kicking off second-order effects
and just accomplishing our goals by coincidence?</p>

<p>Let’s look at the facts.</p>

<p>Building medical software has tons of additional overhead. This leads to slower development, additional hires
and more audits. What do companies need when development slows down, head count increases and auditors knock
on your door? Right - more money.</p>

<p>We’re severely limiting the number of companies who can enter the market by raising the bar of funding
required.</p>

<p>What are the consequences?</p>

<p>Only companies with a lot of funding (and time) are able to enter the market. A two-person startup can’t
afford to hire expensive staff for regulatory compliance. And they sure as hell can’t afford to put countless
man-hours into documenting regulatory-compliant processes! What sort of processes do you need in a two-person
startup, anyway?</p>

<p>So: We’ve successfully prevented small startups from entering the market.</p>

<p>What’s the main difference between small startups and large companies? Small startups develop products which
solve existing problems in a novel way. They accomplish this through innovation which others deemed
infeasible, or too <em>risky</em>, or both.</p>

<p><em>Risky</em>. That’s the difference.</p>

<p>GE, Philips, Siemens - do you expect those enterprises to ship a <em>risky</em>, groundbreaking Machine Learning -
based Radiology software which radically automates radiology assessments? Hell no. You can hardly expect them
to ship any features at all. They’re too scared of changing things. They’re scared of things going wrong,
their public image taking a hit and losing their existing customers. They are <em>risk-averse</em>.</p>

<p>So, yes, our medical software has become safer, but not due to our regulatory requirements. Rather because
we’ve created a heavy selection bias of only allowing large, well-funded, risk-averse companies to enter the
market.</p>

<p>We achieved safety at the cost of killing innovation. Flying an airplane, we would say: Great landing, wrong
airport.</p>

<h2 id="a-decision-we-have-to-make">A Decision We Have to Make</h2>

<p>Nowadays, the daring two-person startup can no longer enter the market and reach patients. That’s where
innovation would have happened.</p>

<p>Is that a bad thing? Well, it depends.</p>

<p>Safety and progress are often on opposing ends of a spectrum - in most cases, you can’t have both. We, as a
society, have chosen to heavily favor safety over progress. Better keep things the way they are, because new
things can go wrong. And that’s a fair decision to make.</p>

<p>But I think we’re making the wrong decision. Because most of us are blind to the opportunity cost of <em>not
innovating</em>. We don’t see what would have happened to patients if we had had better software.</p>

<p>While I was working in the hospital, I would regularly be involved in admitting new patients. You won’t
believe how often they didn’t have an up-to-date list of their medication. I’d have to call their GP and
request their medication list to be <em>faxed</em>, if I could reach the GP at all. This process was slow and
error-prone.</p>

<p>Consider: If you’re hit by a car and wheeled into the ER, do you want your medication list to be unavailable
because your GP is unreachable? Do you want your patient history to be lost because it’s on paper, stashed
away in some drawer? Do you want to be exposed to additional radiation for imaging because your old images
are on a CD at your parents place?</p>

<p>Just how many …</p></article></div></div>

<p>This chapter is an attempt to illustrate what are the core principles of Data Oriented Programming as I understand them.
It is highly influenced by my programming experience in Clojure, but I believe that those principles are language agnostic.</p>
<p>One could adhere to them in an Object Oriented (OO) language like Java or C# and one could break them
in a Functional Programming (FP) language like Ocaml, Haskell, JavaScript (or even in Clojure).</p>
<p>In fact, in this chapter, I am going to illustrate how those principles could be applied or broken
in JavaScript, a programming language that supports both FP and OOP.</p>
<p>The principles of Data Oriented (DO) Programming are:</p>

<p>Each principle is explored in a separate article.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

  <p>A basic property of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature">digital signature scheme</a> is that it should specify which signatures are valid and which signatures are invalid, so that all implementations can accept only valid signatures and reject only invalid signatures. <em>Unfortunately, Ed25519 signatures don’t provide this property, making their use in distributed systems fragile and risky.</em></p>
<p>Although the scheme was standardized in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032">RFC8032</a>, the RFC does not specify validation criteria, and does not require conformant implementations to agree on whether a particular signature is valid. In addition, because the specification changed validation criteria years after deployment, it is incompatible with almost all existing implementations. Worse still, some implementations added extra ad-hoc criteria, making them further incompatible.</p>
<p>The result is an extremely wide variation in validation criteria across implemententations. The diagram below plots verification results of a \(14 \times 14\) grid of edge cases, with light squares representing accepted signatures, and dark squares representing rejected ones. As the diagram illustrates, verification results are generally inconsistent not just between implementations, but also between different versions and different modes. <img src="https://hdevalence.ca/images/ed25519-comparison.png"></p>
<p>Some protocols may tolerate this variation, but it is unacceptable for any protocol that requires participants to reach consensus on signature validity. A malicious participant can submit signatures that are accepted by some implementations but rejected by others, causing a network partitition or a consensus fork. Having only a single implementation makes this problem less obvious, but it doesn’t go away, since behavior can vary across versions of the ‘same’ implementation. This occurred in practice with the widely used <code>libsodium</code> library, which made breaking changes to validation criteria in a point release.</p>
<p>Finally, although all of these problems occur when verifying signatures individually, they also prevent the use of batch verification, which can provide a significant performance benefit.</p>
<p>This post describes:</p>

</ul></li>
<li><p>The ZIP215 rules <a href="#fixing-the-problem">(jump)</a>, a set of precisely defined validation criteria for consensus-critical Ed25519 signatures which resolve this problem.

</ol>
<h2 id="the-scope-of-potential-divergence">The scope of potential divergence</h2>
<h3 id="the-ed25519-signing-process">The Ed25519 signing process</h3>
<p>Before explaining the validation criteria, it’s useful to briefly review the signing process. An honest signer generates their signing key, a random scalar \(a\), through a complicated procedure not relevant here. Then, they multiply their signing key by the Curve25519 basepoint \(B\) to obtain their verification key, a curve point \(A = [a]B\). The <em>signing</em> and <em>verification</em> keys are more commonly referred to as the <em>private</em> and <em>public</em> keys, but (following Daira Hopwood), I prefer to use the capability-based terminology, since it more precisely captures the role of the key material.</p>
<p>To sign a message <code>M</code>, a signer first generates a secret random nonce \(r\), through a procedure that is also not relevant here, and then form a public commitment to this randomness by computing \(R = [r]B\). Next, they use a hash function \(H\) to compute a challenge scalar as \( k \gets H(R, A, M) \). Finally, they compute a response scalar as \( s \gets r + ka \).</p>
<h3 id="divergence-in-ed25519-signature-validation-criteria">Divergence in Ed25519 signature validation criteria</h3>
<p>To understand the scope of potential divergence in validation criteria, let’s walk through the steps to verify a signature <code>sig</code> with verification key \(A\) on the message <code>M</code>, noting each step with a possibly divergent behavior choice. Then, in subsequent sections, we’ll look at the scope and implications of each divergence.</p>
<p>Ed25519 signatures are 64 bytes long, structured as two 32-byte components: <code>sig = R_bytes || s_bytes</code>. The first 32 bytes store an encoding of \(R\), and the second 32 bytes store an encoding of \(s\). Ed25519 verification keys are 32 bytes long, storing an encoding of \(A\).</p>
<p>Next, the verifier parses <code>s_bytes</code> as \(s\). It’s always possible to interpret a byte string as a little-endian encoded integer, so parsing \(s\) can’t fail. However, \(s\) is supposed to represent an integer \(\mod q\), where \(q\) is the order of the prime-order subgroup of Curve25519. Honestly-generated signatures will have \(0 \leq s &lt; q\), and implementations can choose to reject \(s \ge q\). Call this check <em>canonical \(s\)</em>.</p>
<p>Next, the verifier attempts to parse <code>A_bytes</code> as \(A\). Not all byte strings are valid point encodings, so parsing \(A\) can fail, causing the signature to be rejected. Points can be encoded non-canonically, although in contrast to the encoding of \(s\), the mechanism is somewhat more complicated and subtle, as will be described <a href="#canonical-a-r">below</a>. Implementations can choose to reject non-canonically encoded curve points. Call this check <em>canonical \(A\)</em>.</p>
<p>The verifier then uses <code>A_bytes</code>, <code>R_bytes</code>, and the message <code>M</code> to recompute the challenge value \(k \gets H(R, A, M)\). (Note that since \(H\) is a hash function, it actually operates on the encodings <code>A_bytes</code> and <code>R_bytes</code>, not their decoded internal representations).</p>
<p>Implementations then make a <em>choice of verification equation</em>, choosing which of two verification equations to check. They can use either the <em>batched equation</em> \[ [8]R = [8]([s]B - [k]A), \] or the <em>unbatched equation</em> \[ R = [s]B - [k]A. \] The naming of <em>batched equation</em> versus <em>unbatched equation</em> suggests that the difference is related to batched versus individual verification, but in fact these give different behavior even in the case of individual verification, as will be explained <a href="#choice-of-verification-equation">below</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, to actually check whichever equation is used, an implementation must choose an <em>equality check</em>. Recall that we didn’t actually decode <code>R_bytes</code> to \(R\) yet. When using the batched equation, an implementation must operate on \(R\), so it must decode <code>R_bytes</code> to \(R\), and check equality of curve points. This also means it must make a choice of whether to require <em>canonical \(R\)</em>.</p>
<p>When using the unbatched equation, however, an implementation can choose to either check equality of curve points, or to compute \(R’ \gets [s]B - [k]A\), encode \(R’\) to <code>Rprime_bytes</code>, and check equality of byte strings. When \(R\) is canonically encoded, these equality checks produce the same result. But because the encoding procedure produces canonical encodings, if <code>R_bytes</code> contains a non-canonical encoding of \(R\), then even if \(R’ = R\) (as curve points), <code>Rprime_bytes</code> may differ from <code>R_bytes</code> (as byte strings).</p>
<h3 id="points-of-potential-divergence">Points of potential divergence</h3>
<p>In summary, there are a number of points of potential divergence between implementations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Whether to require <em>canonical \(s\)</em> or to allow non-canonical encodings.</li>
<li>Whether to require <em>canonical \(A\)</em> or to allow non-canonical encodings.</li>
<li>The <em>choice of verification equation</em>, either <em>batched</em> or <em>unbatched</em>.</li>
<li>The <em>choice of equality check</em>, and the related choice of <em>canonical \(R\)</em>.</li>
<li>Any other <em>ad-hoc checks</em> added by a particular implementation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before comparing the choices made by RFC8032 and actually existing implementations, let’s examine the exact mechanism and implications of each of these points of potential divergence.</p>
<h3 id="canonical-s">Canonical \(s\)</h3>
<p>The values <code>A_bytes</code>, <code>R_bytes</code>, and <code>M</code> are all fed into the hash function, so they cannot be modified without changing the challenge value. However, a third party could replace \(s\) with \(s’ = s + nq\). Because \(s’ \equiv s \pmod q\), the modified signature \((R, s’)\) would still pass verification. Requiring that <code>s_bytes</code> encodes \(s &lt; q\) prevents this.</p>
<p>This check is simple, low-cost, prevents malleability, is required by RFC8032, and is performed by most implementations. The only notable exception is the original reference implementation of Ed25519, which chose to write a paragraph arguing that signature malleability is never a problem instead of performing the check.</p>
<p>Because this check is fairly common, well-known, and unobjectionable, I didn’t focus on it, and didn’t comprehensively test implementation behavior.</p>
<h3 id="canonical-a-r">Canonical \(A\), \(R\)</h3>
<p>While the mechanism for constructing non-canonically encoded scalar values is fairly simple, the mechanism for constructing non-canonically encoded point values is somewhat more complicated, as mentioned <a href="#divergence-in-ed25519-signature-validation-criteria">above</a>. To explain it, we need to describe the “compressed Edwards \(y\)” encoding used by Ed25519.</p>
<p>Curve25519 is defined over the finite field of order \(p = 2^{255} - 19\), so the coördinates of curve points \((x,y)\) are integers \(\mod p\). The curve equation in (twisted) Edwards form is \[ - x^2 + y^2 = 1 + d x^2 y^2, \] where \(d\) is a curve parameter. This means that \[ x^2 = \frac { y^2 - 1} {d y^2 + 1}. \] If the fraction on the right-hand side is nonsquare, then there is no \(x\) so that the right-hand side equals \(x^2\), and the \(y\) value is not the \(y\)-coördinate of a curve point. If it is square, then there is a square root \(x\), and the value of \(y\) is sufficient to recover \(x\) up to a choice of sign.</p>
<p>Because \(p &lt; 2^{255}\), the encodings of field elements fit in 255 bits. The compressed Edwards \(y\) format uses the first 255 bits to store the \(y\) coördinate, and the 256th bit to indicate the sign of the \(x\) …</p></div></div></div></div>

Build trust</strong></h2><p id="f5e8">I have always enjoyed the difference between <em>fight against</em> and <em>fight with</em>. If your team feels that you fight with them, being their brother or sister in arms, they will trust you. If your team member is looking for external help from anyone except you, it is not a good sign. They feel some tension as you fight against them, consciously or not.</p><p id="a11d">Let’s imagine that you are not the first person your inferiors share their concerns with. What will they do then? They will escalate all issues to your manager or leave your team. How to avoid this?</p><p id="d406">Don’t pretend to be a superhero — share with people your failures, not only wins. Use self-irony where possible. Don’t treat people as functions. Remember that they have families, health issues, hobbies. Let them live a life, no one is obliged to sacrifice themselves to work. Share their grief and joy — be a human, not a function, too.</p><h2 id="4804"><strong>2. Be thankful</strong></h2><p id="47f4">Another person can never meet your expectations by 100% because they are not you. Great managers say, if work is done the right way by at least 50%, thank the guy and provide them actionable feedback. Another 50% of issues might be resolved thanks to your remarks. You never know until you try.</p><p id="a372">Very often we are focusing on what people under us are doing wrong. You will surely spot the loose points and things you are unhappy with, criticizing is the easy part of it. Try to find words of support for what people do the right way. Someone has completed an important mission on time? Express some gratitude, not all people are responsible enough to do so! If someone works long hours and weekends, don’t pretend that it’s okay. Thank the hard worker and make sure they have enough time for rest, too.</p><h2 id="1a53"><strong>3. Give credits</strong></h2><p id="1c77">People hate when the results of their efforts are stolen. Don’t position yourself as the only one working on important tasks. Otherwise, you’ll face many departures in your team. If you report the completion of an important project, mention all contributors. Use public praise extensively. Communicate the progress every team member makes to C-levels and HR. Ensure that timely promotions and bonus payments go to everyone who deserves them.</p><p id="4d7f">People want fair treatment. Bear in mind, that everyone tends to overestimate their role and contribution. It’s normal and you need to stay aligned with your team’s expectations. And they expect praise and respect for what they do. Whoever authored a win, always mention this guy. If you are great at that, it will also encourage people to own their mistakes. If they know that you prefer to praise people, not scold them, they are less likely to conceal their failures.</p><h2 id="c26a"><strong>4. Support initiatives</strong></h2><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Managers in office." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/10368/0*nwPXykrgKpYDWgDM" width="5184" height="3888" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*nwPXykrgKpYDWgDM 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/0*nwPXykrgKpYDWgDM 500w" sizes="500px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*nwPXykrgKpYDWgDM?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="afc9">People feel discouraged if they share a good idea in vain. Be a person who cares for people’s proposals. Otherwise, they’ll find a better workplace where their voices can be heard. Let them speak freely and criticize you, too.</p><p id="9284">Caring staff members are never silent, they bring innovation to the table. Of course, you cannot accept each and every idea. This might introduce chaos and break the existing process. However, if their initiatives are not even considered, people usually stop even trying. Consider every proposal. Let your answer be well-grounded, be it a ‘yes’ or a ‘no’. If you cannot implement 100% of the employee’s plan, put in place 50% — sane people will be grateful for it, too. Your staff doesn’t expect change to happen in the blink of an eye. They simply want to see things moving and take part in this process.</p><h2 id="0bbe"><strong>5. Take details into account</strong></h2><p id="3cad">On a busy day, we all tend to scan our inbox rather than read emails one by one. Yet, not all people are great at subject lines or clear messages. Something important can always slip away because we are not robots. Re-read emails from the silent team members who rarely remind you of their existence. They might be important.</p><p id="c143">What looks easy to handle for you, might be a matter of life and death for your employee. Remember that your starters might be frustrated and see a tragedy in every minor mistake. Remember that your most experienced game players might need more rest. While reading a message, try to see the person’s emotional condition behind the lines. Are they stressed or disappointed? People do expect advice and interest from you. If you feel that something is wrong, you’d better ask about it. In many cases, it decreases turnover. Just ask.</p><h2 id="5e79"><strong>1. Don’t overpromise</strong></h2><p id="3eb8">Setting wrong expectations is a common mistake. Not only with customers, with your staff too. Imagine that you know for sure that the company won’t promote a person from your department any time soon. Don’t use promotion as motivation in this case. Don’t pretend that it became impossible all of a sudden due to the employee’s recent failure.</p><p id="eb22">Underpromising is much better than overpromising. If you surprise your team members by a special bonus, it will trigger excitement. Imagine that the bonus is just being discussed. You know that it depends on a contract with a big name customer which might or might not be signed. Don’t talk about it in advance. Otherwise, your inferiors will blame you for extra expectations and the consequent disappointment. If you are not sure about something yet, don’t mention it.</p><h2 id="2d5e"><strong>2. Don’t micromanage</strong></h2><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Wall with just don't." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/7194/0*eACMQJEz4eZRPFd0" width="3597" height="2391" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*eACMQJEz4eZRPFd0 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/0*eACMQJEz4eZRPFd0 500w" sizes="500px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*eACMQJEz4eZRPFd0?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="f2ac">Let people go for the tasks assigned to them. Don’t prevent them from doing their job popping up here and there and criticizing what is not yet ready for review. This is disrespectful, and this proves that you are not a mature manager. If your team perceives you as someone willing to catch them by the hand for a round of scolding, it won’t bring you any good.</p><p id="314e">Let’s say you need to control the progress your team makes on a large task. Find a special time for demo sessions where the team will present the changes to you. Discuss all blockers there and correct mistakes on the go. Let people know that you struggle for the best possible result. Give them a hint that you don’t need the crown of the smartest person. In this case, they will take your criticism much easier.</p><h2 id="8b17"><strong>3. Don’t play games</strong></h2><p id="7e07">A good result should be the only goal of any work-related activity. Usually, it’s a measurable thing. An amount of money on your recent contract. A number of your software downloads, or repo followers. Non-profit organizations also track the number of people served monthly.</p><p id="531a">Don’t use your workplace to play any kind of ‘superior-inferior’ games. It will ruin your career and reputation with time. Do you make people feel bad to enjoy yourself as someone possessing power? It’s the sign of a mental disorder, and you’d better consult a psychotherapist taking a break off work. Do you give a person a task they obviously cannot cope with? Deliberately propose unrealistic deadlines? Make long hours a regular practice without any real need? Compare two team members making them compete with each other? All these things should be on your ‘avoid’ list. Make sure that you are King Arthur for your team, not a suppressor. People hate being insulted or humiliated. They quit.</p><h2 id="3530"><strong>4. Don’t pretend to be a saint</strong></h2><p id="abe8">Everybody makes mistakes, and you are no exception. In fact, you are in a position to make fatal mistakes — the ones that may affect the future of the entire team. If you have come up with a misconception that proves to be a failure for your co-workers, own it. You haven’t researched things or even had not enough qualifications. So people wasted their time. They might be even deprived of their bonuses and promotions due to your lack of vision.</p><p id="c29c">Be honest about the mistakes you have made recently or in the past. Only strong people admit that they are imperfect. You won’t lose your team’s respect honestly saying that you were wrong. Especially if you do something about your mistake. Moreover, other people on the team will more likely share their mistakes too. Be their fellow sinner.</p><h2 id="bf64"><strong>5. Don’t look for scapegoats</strong></h2><p id="1d8a">No one likes that “boss &amp; fools” game. Don’t look for a person to blame for every failure. It is unproductive and bad from an ethical viewpoint. After investigating what went wrong, focus on fixing things asap, not punishment. You can look into the reasons after firefighting. Most likely you’ll discover that there is more than one person and factors behind every problem.</p><p id="6f98">If you have a ‘scapegoat on duty’ on the team, you are obviously biased against this person. Take immediate action. If you don’t like working with someone, talk to HR and other hiring managers. Discuss the possible transfer opportunities for this person. Make sure that these opportunities are communicated to them. If you cannot work together for some reason, be honest about it. Someone incompatible with you can still bring value elsewhere within the company. Good managers handle such cases fast if they inherited a team from another manager. If you hired a wrong person for your team, you own it, too. Invest your time in training them. You might have to let them go, sharing the …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p id="DIY"><h2>DIY R&amp;D vs outsourcing R&amp;D to Ukraine</h2></p><div><div><p>If you intend to set up your own R&amp;D center, you’ll need at least three times deeper pockets than you will set up shop in Ukraine. If you’re in a hurry to get going</p><p>The decision to set up an R&amp;D center is one that shouldn’t be made without a solid due diligence effort. You’ll need to examine risks and advantages, scope of effort, objectives, impact on your core strategy. Next, cost assessments which should be compared against your options – by location and relative to outsourcing opportunities. If you go ahead with it locally, you’ll need to source a location, possible construction or infrastructure requirements, and start hiring.</p><p>Aside from cost of options, the set up time between DIY and Outsourcing R&amp;D can vary by six months, on average. Depending upon your requirements, outsourcing options are likely to be up and running within 1-3 months. Setting up an R&amp;D center from scratch and staffing it can take a year or more, or perhaps 6 months if a suitable facility is already available.</p><p>As we’ve discussed several times, the all inclusive <a href="https://perceptionbox.io/business/san-francisco-hiring-vs-outsourcing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">costs of Ukrainian developers</a> are 25-50% less than their Western European and North American counterparts. For an example, factoring on a basis of (an all-inclusive) $50k per Ukrainian developer vs. a US median wage of $107k + $20k in taxes and bare-benefits:</p><ul><li>A team of 20 developers in Ukraine will cost $1 million + office space, annually.</li><li>A team of 20 developers in the US will cost $2.5 million + office space, annually.</li></ul><p>If you get into the nitty-gritty, extending purchasing power parity across all line items, Ukraine will easily offer a 3-to-1 cost advantage for your R&amp;D dollar.</p></div></div><p id="How"><h2>How &amp; why tech leaders are doing R&amp;D in Ukraine</h2></p><div><div><p>United States companies account for about 50% of all IT related investments in Ukraine, but it is truly open to international partnerships. Companies from South Korea, Japan, France, and Sweden, to name a few are all active here. How they enter the Ukraine R&amp;D sector varies considerably – from mergers and acquisitions to strategic partnerships, to direct investments. Their reasons – or the technologies attracting them reflect the full range of high-tech spectrum.</p><p>The following list reflects R&amp;D activities in Ukraine by the largest tech companies – how they entered, their tech focus, and staffing – where available.</p></div></div><p id="Amazon"><h2>#1. Amazon: Merger &amp; Acquisition - IoT &amp; Pattern Recognition</h2></p><div><p>Amazon has its hands in everything and wants to get into consumer homes in a big way. In 2018, Amazon acquired Ring for over $1 billion, picking up its R&amp;D office in Kyiv. Ring specializes in IoT doorbells, security cameras, and facial recognition technology. Since then, <a href="https://www.uadn.net/2019/02/22/amazon-subsidiary-ring-opens-new-rd-office-in-western-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ring has expanded</a> from 300 to 900 IT specialists, with an additional office opened in Lvov, in 2019.</p></div><p id="Alphabet"><h2>#2. Alphabet/Google: Merger &amp; Acquisition - VMware &amp; Cloud</h2></p><div><p>Like Amazon, Google has a tendency to gobble up enterprising startups. In late 2019, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/inside-google-cloud/helping-customers-run-more-vmware-workloads-in-the-cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google acquired CloudSimple</a>, with undisclosed terms. CloudSimple makes it easy for companies to, “migrate their VMware workloads from on-premises data centers directly into Google Cloud.” Google opened its first office in Kyiv in 2006 for customer support. CloudSimple’s Ukrainian office has 30 engineers,</p></div><p id="Oracle"><h2>#3. Oracle - Merger &amp; Acquisition - Cloud</h2></p><div><p>In August of 2015, <a href="https://www.oracle.com/corporate/pressrelease/oracle-buys-maxymiser-082015.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oracle acquired Maxymiser</a> – a New York based company with offices in Kyiv and Dnipro, for $160 million. Oracle is the 2nd largest software company by revenue and market capitalization. Maxymiser provides cloud-based software to help marketers, “test, target and personalize what a customer sees on a Web page or app.”</p></div><p id="Samsung"><h2>#4. Samsung -  Own Offices - AI, Security, and Next Gen Imaging</h2></p><div><p>One of the largest R&amp;D centers in all of Europe, <a href="https://research.samsung.com/srk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Samsung R&amp;D Institute Ukraine</a> was established in 2009 in Kyiv. In 2013, Samsung opened up an additional R&amp;D facility in Kharkov bringing its estimated IT staff to over a thousand. Samsung’s R&amp;D efforts focus on artificial intelligence, data intelligence, information security, next-generation communications and visual technologies to include AR/VR.</p></div><div><p><img src="https://perceptionbox.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2.jpg" data-src="https://perceptionbox.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2.jpg" alt="image"></p></div><p id="Ubisoft"><h2>#5. Ubisoft: Own Offices - Game Development</h2></p><div><p>Ubisoft has over 700 staff in development offices in Kyiv and Odessa. Headquartered in France, Ubisoft is the fifth largest publicly traded game company in the US and EU. It’s known for blockbusters like Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon and other hits, while also recently entering into movie production.</p></div><p id="Wargaming"><h2>#6. Wargaming.net: Strategic Partnership - Game Development</h2></p><div><p>In 2011, Wargaming.net established a strategic partnership with Persha Studia and its 550 employees. Founded in 2000, Persha Studia has collaborated with Electronic Arts, Activision, and Cryptic. Now it handles development for Wargaming’s World of Warplanes and World of Tanks: Generals.</p></div><p id="Ebay"><h2>#7. Ebay and Adobe: Merger and Acquisition - eCommerce</h2></p><div><p>In 2011, the online auction-platform eBay acquired Magento, a Los Angeles-based company, for $180 million. Magento is an open-source eCommerce platform. It’s entire development process was defined by its Kyiv development office which has about 200 staff. Then, 7 years later, <a href="https://100cms.org/news/magento/710-Adobe-buys-Magento-company-with-office-in-Ukraine-for-$-168-billion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adobe purchased Magento from eBay for $1.68 billion</a>, with its Ukrainian team intact. That’s almost a 10x increase!</p></div><p id="And"><h2>And for Startups? Looksery</h2></p><div><div><p>There are many, manor more Research and Development centers throughout Ukraine. They can be found working for other big names like Siemens (automation), Boeing (aeronautics), Netcracker (Telecom), Ericsson (IoT, eHealth and eGov), and Rakuten (eCommerce). But, there’s a lot of potential for startups and small R&amp;D teams, too — the opportunities are not exclusive to the big boys.</p><p>Looksery, founded in 2013, had a small development team in Odessa – less than 10 developers in total. One of the first popular Augmented Reality apps, it was backed by a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/looksery/looksery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$45k Kickstarter campaign</a> in March of 2015. Six months later? Snapchat acquired it for $150 million.</p></div></div><p><h4>Summary</h4></p><div><div><p>Though just a superficial snapshot and proverbial iceberg, the R&amp;D opportunities in Ukraine continue to grow. The largest of tech companies have found, in their words, that Ukraine offers an incredible cost-advantage. Every $1 spent or invested in Ukrainian R&amp;D efforts is roughly the equivalent of $3 in the United States. These examples also show that Ukrainian offices are not just jettisoned or closed after acquisitions – but retained. Afforded an opportunity, Ukrainian developers and IT specialists can propel truly dramatic growth and profitability – for megacorps or bootstrapping startups.</p><p>If you’d like to find out more about your R&amp;D options in Ukraine – we’d love to hear from you!</p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

			<p>The ECB, as guardian of the euro, provides currency in two forms: we issue banknotes and we transfer electronic deposits to banks and other financial institutions.</p>
			<p>Digitalisation has spread to every corner of our lives and transformed how we pay. In this new era, a digital euro would guarantee that citizens in the euro area can maintain free access to a simple, universally accepted, safe and trusted means of payment. A digital euro is not meant to replace cash, but rather to complement it. Together, they give people more choices about how to pay, and make it easier for them to do so,  increasing financial inclusion. </p>

			<p>The Eurosystem will continue to ensure that all citizens have access to euro banknotes and coins across the euro area.</p>

				<h3>Why a digital euro?</h3>
				<p>A digital euro would make your daily payments faster, easier and more secure.
						It could support the digitalisation of the European economy and actively encourage innovation in retail payments. 			
				</p>
				<p>The ECB and the national central banks of the euro area are exploring the benefits and risks so that money continues to serve Europeans well.</p>

				<h3>What are other benefits of a digital euro?</h3>
				<p>A digital euro would preserve the benefits that the euro provides to all of us. It would help to deal with situations in which people no longer prefer cash. </p>
						<p>It would help cushion the impact of extreme events – such as natural disasters or pandemics – when traditional payment services may no longer function. It could also be crucial if people were to turn to foreign digital means of payment, which might undermine financial stability and monetary sovereignty in the euro area.

		<div>
			<h3>When will it be ready?</h3>
			<p>During the preparation phase, we are working on the concept, starting practical experimentation on possible designs, and discussing with stakeholders and international partners.
					Towards the middle of 2021 we will decide whether to launch a digital euro project. This will be followed by an investigation phase on user requirements and service providers.
								
			</p>
			<p>It would take time to develop a safe, accessible and efficient digital currency. We will ensure that the systems we use to pay keep up with the needs of the people who use them.   </p>

				<h3>Why would a digital euro not be a crypto-asset?</h3>
				<p>Crypto-assets are fundamentally different from central bank money: their prices are volatile because they lack any intrinsic value and there is no reliable institution backing them. 
				</p>
			<p>People using a digital euro would have the same level of confidence as with cash, since they are both backed by a central bank, which is something crypto-assets such as stablecoins cannot provide.  </p>

		<h3>Share your opinion with us!</h3>
		
		 <p>Like the euro we already use every day, the design of a digital euro should meet the needs of a broad range of users. Any assessment must therefore take into account all of its implications, for instance for monetary policy and financial stability.
  </p>
 <p>We will open a public consultation on 12 October – stay tuned!</p>

		<em>The story of a bug, and how I addressed it.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		Okay, I admit it: I could have given this article all sorts of alternative titles, each of which would have made as much sense as the one I chose. I didn't want to go with some of the other titles I had in mind, because they would give it all away up front. I didn't want to spoil the surprise.
	</p>
	<p>
		I recently ran into this bug, it took me hours to troubleshoot it, and I was appalled when I realised what the problem was.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is the story of that bug.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are several insights from this story, and I admit that I picked the most click-baity one for the title.
	</p>
	<h3 id="94bc204499df483897121bb0343f73f7">
		Yak shaving <a href="#94bc204499df483897121bb0343f73f7" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		I was working on the umpteenth variation of an online restaurant reservations system, and one of the features I'd added was a schedule only visible to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma%C3%AEtre_d%27h%C3%B4tel">maître d'</a>. The schedule includes a list of all reservations for a day, including guests' email addresses and so on. For that reason, I'd protected that resource by requiring a valid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token">JSON Web Token</a> (JWT) with an appropriate role.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'd deployed a new version of the API and went for an ad-hoc test. To my surprise, that particular resource didn't work. When I tried to request it, I got a <code>403 Forbidden</code> response.
	</p>
	<p>
		"That's odd," I though, "it worked the last time I tried this."
	</p>
	<p>
		The system is set up with continuous deployment. I push <em>master</em> to a remote repository, and a build pipeline takes over from there. It only deploys the new version if all tests pass, so my first reaction was that I might have made a mistake with the JWT.
	</p>
	<p>
		I wasted significant time decoding the JWT and comparing its contents to what it was supposed to be. I couldn't find any problems.
	</p>
	<p>
		I also meticulously compared the encryption key I'd used to sign the JWT with the key on the server. They were identical.
	</p>
	<p>
		Incredulous, and running out of ideas, I tried running all tests on my development machine. Indeed, all 170 tests passed.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, I gave up and ran the API on my development machine. It takes all of a 30 seconds to configure the code to run in that environment, so you're excused if you wonder why I didn't already do that. What can I say? I've almost two decades of experience with automated test suites. Usually, if all tests pass, the problem is environmental: a network topology issue, a bad or missing connection string, a misconfigured encryption key, an invalid JWT, things like that.
	</p>
	<p>
		To my surprise, the problem also manifested on my machine.
	</p>
	<h3 id="b726532ae06844eb8aeaa2c27ca0d913">
		Not my code <a href="#b726532ae06844eb8aeaa2c27ca0d913" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Okay, even with hundreds of tests, perhaps some edge case went unnoticed. The only problem with that hypothesis was that this was hardly an edge case. I was only making a <code>GET</code> request with a <code>Bearer</code> token. I wasn't going through some convoluted sequence of steps.
	</p>
	<pre>GET /restaurants/1/schedule/2020/9/30 HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5c[...]</pre>
	
	<p>
		I expected a successful response containing some JSON, but the result was <code>403 Forbidden</code>. That was the same behaviour I saw in the production environment.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now, to be clear, this is indeed a protected resource. If you present an invalid JWT, <code>403 Forbidden</code> is the expected response. That's why I wasted a few hours looking for problems with the the JWT.
	</p>
	<p>
		I finally, hesitatingly, concluded that the problem might be somewhere else. The JWT looked okay. So, hours into my troubleshooting I reluctantly set a breakpoint in my code and started the debugger. It isn't rational, but I tend to see it as a small personal defeat if I have to use the debugger. Even so, if used judiciously, it can be an effective way to identify problems.
	</p>
	<p>
		The debugger never hit my breakpoint.
	</p>
	<p>
		To be clear, the beginning of my Controller method looked like this:
	</p>
	<pre>[<span>Authorize</span>(Roles&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span>"MaitreD"</span>)]
[<span>HttpGet</span>(<span>"restaurants/{restaurantId}/schedule/{year}/{month}/{day}"</span>)]
<span>public</span>&nbsp;<span>async</span>&nbsp;<span>Task</span>&lt;<span>ActionResult</span>&gt;&nbsp;Get(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>int</span>&nbsp;restaurantId,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>int</span>&nbsp;year,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>int</span>&nbsp;month,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>int</span>&nbsp;day)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>if</span>&nbsp;(!AccessControlList.Authorize(restaurantId))
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>return</span>&nbsp;<span>new</span>&nbsp;<span>ForbidResult</span>();</pre>
	
	<p>
		My breakpoint was on the first line (the <code>if</code> conditional), but the debugger didn't break into it. When I issued my <code>GET</code> request, I immediately got the <code>403 Forbidden</code> response. The breakpoint just sat there in the debugger, mocking me.
	</p>
	<p>
		When that happens, it's natural to conclude that the problem occurs somewhere in the framework; in this case, ASP.NET. To test that hypothesis, I commented out the <code>[Authorize]</code> attribute and reissued the <code>GET</code> request. My hypothesis was that I'd get a <code>200 OK</code> response, since the attribute is what tells ASP.NET to check authorisation.
	</p>
	<p>
		The hypothesis held. The response was <code>200 OK</code>.
	</p>
	<h3 id="fdff404f12644a898b6a3e695fb6533f">
		Test interdependency <a href="#fdff404f12644a898b6a3e695fb6533f" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		I hate when that happens. It's up there with fixing other people's printers. The problem is in the framework, not in my code. I didn't have any authorisation callbacks registered, so I was fairly certain that the problem wasn't in my code.
	</p>
	<p>
		I rarely jump to the conclusion that there's a bug in the framework. In my experience, <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-first-rule-of-programming-its-always-your-fault">select is rarely broken</a>. My new hypothesis had to be that I'd somehow managed to misconfigure the framework.
	</p>
	<p>
		But where? There were automated tests that verified that a client could request that resource with a valid JWT. There were other automated tests that verified what happened if you presented an invalid JWT, or none at all. And all tests were passing.
	</p>
	<p>
		While I was fiddling with the tests, I eventually ran a parametrised test by itself, instead of the entire test suite:
	</p>
	<pre>[<span>Theory</span>]
[<span>InlineData</span>(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>"Hipgnosta"</span>,&nbsp;2024,&nbsp;11,&nbsp;&nbsp;2)]
[<span>InlineData</span>(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>"Nono"</span>,&nbsp;2018,&nbsp;&nbsp;9,&nbsp;&nbsp;9)]
[<span>InlineData</span>(<span>"The&nbsp;Vatican&nbsp;Cellar"</span>,&nbsp;2021,&nbsp;10,&nbsp;10)]
<span>public</span>&nbsp;<span>async</span>&nbsp;<span>Task</span>&nbsp;GetRestaurantScheduleWhileAuthorized(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>string</span>&nbsp;name,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>int</span>&nbsp;year,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>int</span>&nbsp;month,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>int</span>&nbsp;day)</pre>
	
	<p>
		This parametrised test has three test cases. When I ran just that test method, two of the test cases passed, but one failed: the <em>Nono</em> case, for some reason I haven't yet figured out.
	</p>
	<p>
		I didn't understand why that test case ought to fail while the others succeeded, but I had an inkling. I commented out the <em>Nono</em> test case and ran the test method again.
	</p>
	<p>
		One passed and one failing test.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now <em>The Vatican Cellar</em> test case was failing. I commented that out and ran the test method again. The remaining test case failed.
	</p>
	<p>
		This reeks of some sort of test interdependency. Apparently, <em>something</em> happens during the first test run that makes succeeding tests pass, but it happens too late for the first one. But what?
	</p>
	<h3 id="c95c3e707f46467abbf8ff02a9594c4c">
		Bisect <a href="#c95c3e707f46467abbf8ff02a9594c4c" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Then something occurred to me that I should have thought of sooner. This feature used to work. Not only had the tests been passing, but I'd actually interacted with the deployed service, presenting a valid JWT and received a <code>200 OK</code> response.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once than dawned on me, I realised that it was just a manner of performing a binary search. Since, of course, I use version control, I had a version I knew worked, and a version that didn't work. The task, then, was to find the commit that introduced the defect.
	</p>
	<p>
		As I've already implied, the system in question is an example code base. While I have a cloud-based production environment, none but I use it. It had been four or five days since I'd actually interacted with the real service, and I'd been busy making changes, trusting exclusively in my test suite. I tend to make frequent, small commits instead of big, infrequent commits, so I had accumulated about a hundred and fifty commits since the 'last known good' deployment.
	</p>
	<p>
		Searching through hundreds of commits sounds overwhelming, but using binary search, it's actually not that bad. Pick the commit halfway between the 'last known good' commit and the most recent commit, and check it out. See if the defect is present there. If it is, you know that it was introduced somewhere between the commit you're looking at, and the 'last known good' commit. If it isn't present, it was introduced later. Regardless of the outcome, you know in which half to look. You now pick a new commit in the middle of that set and repeat the exercise. Even with, say, a hundred commits, the first bisection reduces the candidate set to 50, the next bisection to 25, then 13, then 7, 4, 2, and then you have it. If you do this systematically, you should find the exact commit in less than eight iterations.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is, as far as I understand it, the algorithm used by <em>Git bisect</em>. You don't have to use the <code>bisect</code> command - the algorithm is easy enough to do by hand - but let's see how it works.
	</p>
	<p>
		You start a <code>bisect</code> session with:
	</p>
	<pre><span>mark@Vindemiatrix</span> <span>MINGW64</span> <span>~/Documents/Redacted/Restaurant</span> <span>((93c6c35...))</span>
$ git bisect start

<span>mark@Vindemiatrix</span> <span>MINGW64</span> <span>~/Documents/Redacted/Restaurant</span> <span>((93c6c35...)|BISECTING)</span></pre>
	
	<p>
		This starts an interactive session, which you can tell from the Git integration in Git Bash (it says <code>BISECTING</code>). You now mark a commit as being bad:
	</p>
	<pre>$ git bisect bad

<span>mark@Vindemiatrix</span> <span>MINGW64</span> <span>~/Documents/Redacted/Restaurant</span> <span>((93c6c35...)|BISECTING)</span></pre>
	
	<p>
		If you don't provide a commit ID at that point, Git is going to assume that you meant that the current commit (in this case <code>93c6c35</code>) is bad. That's what I had in mind, so that's fine.
	</p>
	<p>
		You now tell it about a commit ID that you know is good:
	</p>
	<pre>$ git bisect good 7dfdab2
Bisecting: 75 revisions left to test after this (roughly 6 steps)
[1f78c9a90c2088423ab4fc145b7b2ec3859d6a9a] Use InMemoryRestaurantDatabase in a test

<span>mark@Vindemiatrix</span> <span>MINGW64</span> <span>~/Documents/Redacted/Restaurant</span> <span>((1f78c9a...)|BISECTING)</span></pre>
	
	<p>
		Notice that Git is already telling us how many iterations we should expect. You can also see that it checked out a new commit (<code>1f78c9a</code>) for you. That's the half-way commit.
	</p>
	<p>
		At this point, I manually ran the test method with the three test cases. All three passed, so I marked that commit as good:
	</p>
	<pre>$ git bisect good
Bisecting: 37 revisions left to test after this (roughly 5 steps)

Now my name shows up (it didn’t before!) as someone who violates Twitter rules (I didn’t!) and was accordingly suspended.</p><p>I tried to boost my visibility via social media but ended up hurting it: people <em>have</em> referred to my handle but anyone who looks at it will see a <a href="https://twitter.com/SableMeyer">suspended account with no activity</a></p></section><section id="motivation"><h2>Motivation</h2><p>I consider most social media to be harmful at the individual and societal level. A position I can afford because, while I sometime rant against events organized solely on Facebook, I am lucky to be in an environnement where I can avoid them and remain socially connected.</p><p>Recent discussions and readings made me reconsider this position when it comes to Twitter. While I can wave it off my personal life and lose nothing, evidence piles up that for my professional career in academia, having a presence on twitter matters, notably to improve cites <span data-cites="eysenbach2011can luc2020does">[1, 2]</span> and to be informed of new papers before/as they are published.</p><p>I was convinced to open a Twitter account about a month ago, mid 2020. My research advisor was speaking in a conference of high attendance and presented joint work. After the talk he asked me for my account so that he could cite me when twitting the article he mentioned. I could have replied that I didn’t want or need an account, but my advisor’s account has over 20k followers – including pretty much anywhere I could imagine myself applying after a PhD – and declining seemed so unwise I created an account and sent an email on the spot.</p></section><section id="the-downfall"><h2>The downfall</h2><p>Opening an account was a pleasant experience and done in less than a minute. The “phone number” field is optional: while I don’t doubt they already have it (as of this writing the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twitter.android">android app</a> requires contact access), this was meant to be a professional account and I consider my phone number personal so I was happy to be given the possibility not to fill that field.</p><p>I proceeded to add two pictures of me, update my profile a bit, and follow my research advisor. Then I could do nothing else. My account was immediately suspended and I received an email stating: “Your account appears to have exhibited automated behavior that violates the Twitter Rules”. Trying to log it now required my phone number. Given the process so far, I thought I could do without so instead I chose to click the “contact support” link and wrote a gentle note saying that I did not have a phone number to give<span><label for="sn-0"></label><span>This was probably a bad call, but I stand by the fact that (i) I was implicitly promised that it would not be a requirement, and (ii) I do not have a “professional” phone number and giving my personal one seemed innapropriate</span></span>, but that my account was legitimate nonetheless. After having to confirm my email address once more, I didn’t hear a thing from Twitter, ever. I wrote follow up emails after two weeks, then waited more, to no avail. Eventually my email received an automated response: “You tried to update a case that has been closed. Please submit a new case at&nbsp;http://support.twitter.com/forms”, which I did.</p></section><section id="the-hostage-situation"><h2>The hostage situation</h2><p>Up until now, looking for me on Twitter resulted in not finding me, which I’m fine with. Where it gets messy is that for the past month, if you look for me you’ll see an account that has both my face and the text “Account suspended: Twitter suspends accounts which violate the Twitter Rules”. In a very Kafkaesque way, no one but twitter know which rule I violated or how (recall, I didn’t have time to do anything!), and I don’t know how to redeem myself in Twitter’s eyes.</p><p>I should have known better: this part of <em>why</em> I think current big social media are harmful: they’re not public spaces and have to answer to close to no one. Twitter is free to do whatever they want on their website, and ultimately they get to decide who has a say. But still, I find what they did rather odd: they have such a dominant position that the incentives to register were stronger than my (very strong!) dislike of the website. This is a net win for them: I could have been part of the snowball, and maybe take other people around me who are Twitter-sceptics. Yet instead of rewarding me for making the jump and embracing their newly gained user, they crushed me, leaving a sour taste of abuse of power.</p></section><section id="what-ill-do"><h2>What I’ll do</h2><p>I don’t think there’s much I can do. The dark pattern “no phone required” into “if you don’t give a phone you’ll get banned” won’t look good if looked into seriously by the French DGCCRF (consumers’ protection) but I doubt they will lift a finger, and even if they did we’re talking long timescale. I could create another account, “give up my phone”, but then I’d also give up the handle and the tweets that already reference it. I can forever give up on twitter after being bitten exactly by what I feared would bite me.</p></section><section id="edit-update-mid-september"><h2>Edit: Update mid-September</h2><p>Waiting for an update, so far I didn’t do anything except, every other week, trying to submit a request again. I get automatic (accurate) replies in the form of “It looks like this is connected with your original case <ticket number="">, so we’ve added it to that first report.” and that’s it.</ticket></p></section><section id="edit-update-early-october"><h2>Edit: Update early-October</h2><p>Nothing to report except automatic “acknowledgement” emails (as if…)</p><hr><div id="refs" role="doc-bibliography"><p>[1] Eysenbach, G. 2011.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I'm not a Tailwind shill. I'm a <a href="https://www.swyx.io/guo-lai-ren/">Guo Lai Ren</a> - someone who has changed their mind on it recently and am a happy user despite acknowledged tradeoffs. "Crossover people" can often be more persuasive to skeptics than born-and-bred believers. So I hope to contribute my perspective to the discussion, if you are open to it.</p>
<p>A while ago Adam Wathan <a href="https://twitter.com/tailwindcss/status/1303740401967390720?s=20">asked</a>: "Did you think Tailwind was a horrible idea until you actually built something with it?"</p>
<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1303769383278268416">replied</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I once complained to @samselikoff that Tailwind caused ugly unreadable classname soup and said zero-runtime CSS-in-JS could do more with a lower learning curve.</p>
  <p>I was wrong on 2 counts: Tailwind is easier to learn than I thought, and CSSinJS's flexibility can be a <em>negative</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After shipping a few projects (including my <a href="https://www.swyx.io/">personal site</a> and <a href="https://www.learninpublic.org/">book site</a>) with <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind</a> now, I feel I should probably jot down my thoughts on what I like about it. Since Tailwind is the predominant Utility CSS framework and the only one I've tried, I'll make no effort to distinguish the points below from the general benefits of Utility CSS (but <a href="https://css-tricks.com/need-css-utility-library/">here's a list of others</a>).</p>
<section>
  <h2 id="tldr"><a href="#tldr">TL;DR</a></h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Inlining Styles reduces Naming</strong>: Ship faster by solving one of the known hard problems in Computer Science!</li>
    <li><strong>"System" Values reduce Magic Numbers</strong>: Decrease hardcoded values, Increase consistency.</li>
    <li><strong>Responsive Design in the Browser</strong>: Prototype in browser, copy and paste to codebase, using consistent system values.</li>
    <li><strong>Inlining Styles Optimizes for Change</strong>: Make code easy to delete and move, by reducing cognitive distance to zero.</li>
    <li><strong>Zero JS &amp; Sublinear Scaling of CSS</strong>: Scale at O(log N), not O(N).</li>
    <li><strong>Utility-First, not Utility-Only</strong>: Respect the Principle of Least Power, use CSS-in-JS only when warranted.</li>

  <h2 id="inlining-styles-reduces-naming"><a href="#inlining-styles-reduces-naming">Inlining Styles reduces Naming</a></h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.swyx.io/how-to-name-things/">Naming Things</a> is a known hard problem. We waste a lot of time bickering over naming classes. With Styled-Components, you often write a bunch of intermediate styled components you have to name. With <a href="http://getbem.com/naming/">BEM</a>, we replace one naming problem with three and a half naming problems (I've had PRs held up on whether I should've used <code>--</code> or <code>__</code> - what a total waste of time). How many millions in developer-hours do we waste every year bickering over names?</p>
  <p>With utility CSS we significantly reduce the total number of names in our codebase. This feels minor until you've worked on a codebase where it isn't. What price are you willing to pay to eliminate one of the known known hard problems? I'm not kidding - this is a conversation worth having. Names don't matter to machines but they matter to humans.</p>
  <p>The tradeoff is you have to learn the names from the utility CSS framework. <code>-mb-5</code> and <code>space-x-reverse</code> aren't parseable without docs. The difference is that traditional CSS naming is bespoke per project, whereas you learn Tailwind once and can use them in every project. Yes, you could try to roll your own utilities, but Tailwind's naming is probably more thoughtfully designed than whatever you come up with.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Alternatives exist: Emotion's <code>css</code> prop and <code>styled-jsx</code> also let you skip naming.</p>

  <h2 id="system-values-reduce-magic-numbers"><a href="#system-values-reduce-magic-numbers">"System" Values reduce Magic Numbers</a></h2>
  <p>CSS is extremely flexible, which makes it powerful, but also gives you a lot of footguns to shoot yourself with. Constraints are needed, or else we sprinkle "magic numbers" all over our codebase.</p>
  <p><a href="https://css-tricks.com/magic-numbers-in-css/">Magic Numbers in CSS are a bad thing</a>, says Chris Coyier. He defines it to mean "<em>values which “work” under some circumstances but are frail and prone to break when those circumstances change</em>", but honestly any hardcoded number, like <code>px</code> in margins and media queries, or color variants, is difficult to manage well at scale. The temptation to break rules just to ship a fix is there, and the difficulty of refactoring when design requirements change is too high. If you are working by yourself, there is nothing enforcing that you stick to a consistent set of well designed number scales, which can lead to bad-looking design.</p>
  <p>The solution, of course, is to draw only from a preset range of number values, which I call a "system" (note that I don't call this a "Design System", a debate I have no interest in getting into). Tailwind comes with a good set of font and color systems by default. Again, you could try to roll your own system with CSS variables, but you don't have <a href="https://www.steveschoger.com/speaking/">Steve Schoger</a> on your team.</p>
  <blockquote>

  <h2 id="responsive-design-in-the-browser"><a href="#responsive-design-in-the-browser">Responsive Design in the Browser</a></h2>
  <p>This point is most relevant to developers-who-do-design: the best development workflow is to preview your site on <code>localhost</code>, make adjustments in the browser until you are happy with it, and then copy-and-paste your changes <strong>straight into your codebase</strong>. Let's call this the <strong>Design in Browser</strong> workflow.</p>
  <p>If you want this workflow, you rule out using React's inline styling (which make you use object syntax). But let's say you do use some form of "Write Real CSS"™ solution like Styled-Components or Vue or Svelte scoped styles, where design-in-browser is possible. What else does Tailwind offer you?</p>
  <ol>
    <li>You can pull directly from preset "system" values (elaborated above) while prototyping in browser</li>
    <li>You can do responsive and pseudo-class design while in browser too - e.g. to apply styles at different breakpoints, or on hover or focus, you can just prefix inline, e.g. for a link, <code>text-green-400 hover:text-green-300 md:text-blue-400</code>.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>I did a demo of this in a recent video:</p>
  
  <p>Designing in the Browser is not quite Bret-Victor-style <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII">Inventing on Principle</a>, but you are getting at least closer to being able to "play" in context by reducing the cognitive distance yet again. With Tailwind, you can even add <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/transition-property#app">transitions</a> and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/animation#app">animations</a> inline while you play. This is extremely underrated - we developers might offer more movement in our apps if only it were easier to prototype and add them.</p>

  <h2 id="inlining-styles-optimizes-for-change"><a href="#inlining-styles-optimizes-for-change">Inlining Styles Optimizes for Change</a></h2>
  <p>A lot of production CSS is <a href="https://css-tricks.com/oh-no-stylesheet-grows-grows-grows-append-stylesheet-problem/">append only</a>. This is because the <strong>cognitive distance</strong> between the CSS and the markup it affects is often far - sometimes in a different folder, different file, or same file but dozens of lines away. Pretty soon, you have a codebase you are scared to even open. Developer velocity slows down, and eventually you back yourself into a corner where nothing less than a full rewrite will do.</p>
  <p>By design, CSS is easy to extend. Just add specificity! But <a href="https://programmingisterrible.com/post/139222674273/write-code-that-is-easy-to-delete-not-easy-to">it is not easy to delete</a>. It's easy to build up the house of cards, but take one thing out and the whole edifice may fall apart, and you WON'T KNOW until you check for visual regressions or emulate the browser in your head.</p>
  <p>You can use tooling (CSS modules, static CSS in JS, Vue or Svelte <a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/the-zen-of-just-writing-css">scoped styles</a>) or naming conventions (BEM, etc) to control specificity, but that reduces the cognitive distance rather than eliminates it. The only option with zero "spooky action at a distance" is inline styling. Inline styling <a href="https://overreacted.io/optimized-for-change/">optimizes for change</a>.</p>
  <p>"Galaxy Brain" time: Tailwind offers the developer velocity benefits of inline styles without its downsides.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Alternatives exist: Other solutions like Emotion's <code>css</code> prop and <code>styled-jsx</code> offer similar benefits of inline styles, but they run into the standard CSS in JS downsides</p>

  <h2 id="zero-js--sublinear-scaling-of-css"><a href="#zero-js--sublinear-scaling-of-css">Zero JS &amp; Sublinear Scaling of CSS</a></h2>
  <p>A lot of ink has been spilled about the performance tradeoffs of using CSS in JS, and their mitigating factors. You can check my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qox56z4xH6o">What's New in React talk</a> for more, but rest assured it is hotly debated with passionate, intelligent people on both sides. But we all agree that the less JS you ship, the better, and we also agree that byte-for-byte, shipping 1kb of JS has a far bigger performance impact than 1kb of CSS. Those are well understood.</p>
  <p>The point I'm keen on exploring here is that many CSS and CSS in JS solutions scale linearly with the number of components in your app. Because CSS scopes each declaration to your identifier, you have to repeat it everywhere you want to apply it. This is how we ended up with &gt;50 declarations of <code>font-weight: bold</code> at a previous workplace. Individually, these don't matter, but in bulk, they add up.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"On our old site, we were loading more than 400 KB of compressed CSS (2 MB uncompressed)... We didn’t start out with that much CSS; it just grew over time and rarely decreased. This happened in part because every new feature meant adding new CSS." - <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/web/facebook-redesign/">Facebook Engineering</a></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>You can defer this problem with code-splitting, but eventually people ship and implement hacky workarounds to the point where the CSS gets out of control again (particularly if it is append-only!).</p>
  <p>The solution here is (arguably!) to ship "atomic" CSS, so that your CSS scales by <code>O(log N)</code> instead of <code>O(N)</code> (where <code>N</code> is your number of components). <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1187411809667436550">Facebook's unreleased stylex library</a> lets you write CSS in JS and generates atomic CSS for you, but you could also just choose to hand-write atomic CSS, which is what utility frameworks like Tailwind guide you do.</p>
  <p>To be fair, I put this point at the bottom, because it is unlikely that most apps get to the scale where this really starts to matter, especially when taking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip">gzip</a> into account. However, like with all optimizations, these things are premature until they are not.</p>

  <p>On top of all the above benefits, you can STILL use those other solutions for benefits you need. For example, nothing is truly as powerful as CSS in JS, where you can dynamically change out media query values and entire rulesets based on arbitrary …</p></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><em>
									Welcome to the second interview on 'The Observer Effect'. We are lucky to have one
									of the most influential founders/CEOs in technology and media - Daniel Ek, Founder
									and CEO of Spotify. This interview was published on 4th October, 2020.

							</em></p><p><em>Daniel does things very differently from other business leaders and was generous to go
								deep with us on his leadership style, time management, decision making, Spotify's impact
								on the world and much, much more. Enjoy!
								</em>
							</p><p><b><a href="https://sriramk.com/">Sriram Krishnan</a></b><br>
								<em><strong>Let’s start with the basics. Walk me through a typical day in the life of
										Daniel Ek.</strong></em>
							</p><p><strong>Daniel Ek</strong><br>
								So, this will sound incredibly lazy compared to some leaders. I wake up at around 6:30
								in the morning and spend some time with my kids and wife. At 7:30, I go work out. At
								8:30, I go for a walk – even in the winter. I’ve found this is often where I do my best
								thinking. At 9:30, I read for thirty minutes to an hour. Sometimes I read the news, but
								you’ll also find an ever-rotating stack of books in my office, next to my bed, on tables
								around the house. Books on history, leadership, biographies. It’s a pretty eclectic mix
								– much like my taste in music. Finally, my “work” day really starts at 10:30.
							</p><p>
								Many people make big decisions early on in the day, I make them later in the day--at
								least later in the day here in Europe. Ironically, it's not actually because I'm more
								productive then, rather because we have so many of our staff in the US, and as a result,
								I've kind of primed myself to work that way.
							</p><p>
								So the earlier part of my day is focused on coaching, one-on-ones, and planning. Then, I
								typically tackle one topic a day which takes a lot of my time. That's my big thing for
								the day. Before we go into a live team discussion on that particular topic, I invest
								time to prepare beforehand – reading and talking to members of the team who are either
								part of the decision-making process or who have insights and context. I sometimes even
								get external perspectives.
							</p><p>
								I also think about what my role is at that meeting. Sometimes I'm the approver. Other
								times, I'm supposed to come with a thoughtful perspective on whether an initiative makes
								sense or not.
							</p><p>
								I’ve found that creating this clarity of role for myself is critical. It’s something I
								challenge my direct reports to think about as they engage with their own teams. I remind
								them that all meetings are not the same. Even when we are meeting to discuss really,
								really complicated topics I always ask myself: “What am I going to do in this meeting?
								What does my involvement really need to be?”
							</p><p>
								The truth is: it's entirely contextual. I find it crucial to be upfront about everyone’s
								role in different meetings, I think this is super, super important. Often that's my
								number one thing: to make sure I know what role I'm playing.</p><p>
								<b><i>Wow, okay, there are multiple things in there ranging from how you choose to spend
										your time to how you handle meetings. To work backwards, what makes a good
										meeting in your mind?
									</i></b></p><p>A great meeting has three key elements: the desired outcome of the meeting is clear ahead
								of time; the various options are clear, ideally ahead of time; and the roles of the
								participants are clear at the time.
							</p><p>
								I often find that meetings lack one of those elements. Sometimes they lack all those,
								which is when you have to say, “This is a horrible meeting, let's end it and regroup so
								it can be more effective for everyone.”
							</p><p>
								To clarify outcomes, options, and roles ahead of time, we sometimes rely upon a preread.
								Prereads are a great way to share context so that attendees can quickly get into the
								meat of the issue and not waste time getting everyone up to speed. What I find is when
								you use a tool like a Google Doc, you can take in a great deal of information by reading
								comments, assessing options, and understanding how opinions have evolved over time. With
								this uniform background and context, attendees can focus on discussing the matter at
								hand versus getting on the same page. When the latter happens, the meeting becomes an
								incredible waste of time.
							</p><p>
								I think that's the single largest source of optimization for a company: the makeup of
								their meetings. To be clear, it's not about fewer meetings because meetings serve a
								purpose. Rather, it’s key to improve the meetings, themselves. A lot of my efforts focus
								on teaching people this framework. Ironically, I find that most people are just
								challenged by that stuff.
							</p><p>
								Candidly, that’s my role as leader: to coach others on how best to make use of their
								limited time. Not only is time the most precious resource the company has, it’s also the
								most precious resource they have! It’s crucial that they approach the use of their time
								with a holistic perspective. By way of example, I had a recent call with one of my
								directors who had not taken a vacation in six months. Our conversation delved into why
								this person thought that they could not be away for two weeks, and me arguing for why
								the person had to take two weeks to recharge!
							</p><p>
								There is never enough time – for work, for family and friends – and it takes work to
								make the best use of it. It's all about fostering a holistic perspective in life.

							</p><p>
								<b><i>
										That’s fascinating. Let’s turn to your team.

										Your direct reports are highly accomplished people; what are the common mistakes
										you see executives at that level make when it comes to personal time management?
									</i>
							</b></p><div>
							<div><p>
								I don’t think most executives dedicate enough time to thinking. They spend too much time
								in meetings. By the way, I will say as a caveat, I do know people who are incredibly
								organized and succeed with a lot of “do time.” Shishir Mehrotra [Co-founder and CEO of
								Coda] is a great example. If you've seen the docs on how he organizes his time...
								</p><p>

								<b><i>Oh yeah, he has a lot of very well-organized docs! [laughs]</i></b></p></div><p>
								He is a source of inspiration. For a while, I tried to mimic his style because I was so
								impressed with his thinking behind it. But in the end, it just wasn’t for me. It
								actually drove me nuts. <i>[Sriram laughs]</i>
								But I respect him. I would say he's a highly effective executive. His system works for
								him. It's not one size fits all. Some of my direct reports thrive on lots of meetings.
								But, in general, I would say the largest mistake is that they conflate meetings with
								productivity. Often fewer meetings and better decisions drive the business forward.

							</p>
							<h2 id="opencalendar"><b>On Creating an Open Calendar</b></h2>
							<p>


								<b><i>This dovetails nicely with something that fascinates many of your colleagues: how
										do you have so much open time on your calendar?

										This drastically differs from your typical “successful CEO” who is booked from
										8:30am to 6pm. Walk us through your calendar and how you manage to create this
										open space.
									</i></b>

							</p>

							<p>

								My friends know me well! I do keep a lot of open time. I understand this comes from a
								place of privilege and I’m very lucky to have this flexibility.
							</p>
							<p>

								I feel like synchronous time is very costly; asynchronous time is better. I know there
								are some leaders who prefer to have all executive decisions travel through them. But
								then, you have to wait until the leader has availability to review things. Sometimes you
								run into delays in that process.
							</p>
							<p>
								I typically don't have more than really three or four meetings per day. There are
								exceptions; when I travel, I book in a lot more and I don't keep to my normal schedule.
								That said, most of the time it's three or four meetings a day.

							</p>
							<p>
								My way is to plan long term and do so ahead of time so that people better understand the
								direction in which they're going. You have to be incredibly crisp and clear when doing
								that. For instance, right now we're finalizing our five year plans and long range
								planning. These are actual, real targets fueled by real insights. They are made up of
								lots of super-detailed quarterly and annual goals. I don’t spend much time on the
								quarterly goals and instead focus on our so-called “big rocks.”
							</p>


							<h2 id="bets"><b>On Company Bets</b></h2>
							<p>
								At Spotify, we have something called “Company Bets.” These are large-scale initiatives
								that we believe will have a significant impact on the business within a relatively short
								period of time. I find that these bets are a much better use of my time. Our Company
								Bets typically update every six months, so I'm not needed that much in between. This
								way, I can constantly be thinking: “Where are we headed in the next six months?” Right
								now, I am thinking more about H2 2021. From a timeline perspective, that's the earliest
								place where I focus most of my time.
							</p>
							<p>
								It’s also my role to think far beyond that. For instance, I’m immersing myself in our
								2025 plans. I trust my team to manage the day-to-day, shorter-term initiatives and
								iterate as needed based on data and insights. They’re the best at that and I appreciate
								that this then frees me up to think about the long term.
							</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently <a href="https://jlelse.blog/thoughts/2019/09/vscode-remote-ssh/">rediscovered</a> the ability of Visual Studio Code to develop on remote machines. Just connect to a server via SSH and develop there.</p><p>Even though I’m using Git, I don’t have to commit everything immediately to continue development on another machine, I don’t have to take care to keep all my development tools up to date on all my machines, and I can continue working from my Surface Go with Windows exactly where I left off with my Ubuntu desktop. And I can, for example, start drafting a blog post on one computer, but finish it on another.</p><p>All I need is a cheap rented virtual private server and Visual Studio Code on every machine I want to code from.</p><hr><p>But first of all the reason why I got the idea in the first place:</p><p>To program in Go, I mainly used <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IDEA Ultimate</a> from JetBrains in the past. The best IDE a developer can wish for. Excellent for Java, Kotlin, Go and a lot of other programming languages. And pretty cool: As a student you can get the full IDE for free.</p><p>However, since I won’t be a student forever and IDEA Ultimate or as an alternative just <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoLand</a> from JetBrains <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/store/#personal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aren’t very cheap</a> (at least for hobby projects), I thought I might get used to a different workflow now that will cost me less money later.</p><p>The second best option for developing Go is probably <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visual Studio Code</a>. The Go team took over the development of <a href="https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Go extension</a> not too long ago, which will hopefully make it more and more pleasant to develop Go programs with VS Code in the future.</p><p>VS Code is free, partly even <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open source</a> and I already use it for quite a lot of things anyway, be it for writing longer blog articles or if I need to write some JavaScript. In itself it is just a text editor, but there are quite a few extensions that add all kinds of functionality. And VS Code is fast and available for all three major computer operating systems.</p><p>For VS Code there is an extension called “Remote - SSH” (documentation is available <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>) with which it is possible to connect to another computer or server via SSH. On the remote computer VS Code installs a remote server to provide almost all functionality that is possible locally. It’s like running VS Code directly on the remote computer and developing from there.</p><p>As a server I use the cheapest option from <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hetzner Cloud</a>. With just a few clicks I created a VPS with Ubuntu 20.04, two Gigabytes of RAM and 20 GB SSD storage. I also use Ubuntu 20.04 on my desktop computer and laptop, the environment I am used to. And if the server should be too weak for certain tasks, I can scale it up with a few clicks, even temporarily. The costs are 2,89 € per month. If I don’t need the server for a longer period of time, I could also create an image of the hard drive, delete the server and create a new one later based on the image. That would cost only a few cents per month.</p><p>This way I only have to install all the tools I need on the server. Like Go for the programming of various private projects or Hugo for this blog and my website. But I don’t have to install these tools on all my devices anymore, namely my desktop computer, my Ubuntu-ThinkPad and my Surface Go. There I only need Visual Studio Code with the “Remote - SSH” extension.</p><p>It definitely takes some getting used to in order to adapt to the less comfort you might be used to through the JetBrains IDE. But once you have found the right settings of the Go extension (for example that the Go language server <code>gopls</code> is used), then programming with this setup works quite well.</p><p>My favorite feature is definitely the ability to forward ports from the server to the local machine.</p><p>The only possible negative point is that I need an internet connection to develop so that I can connect to the server. But so often I am not without internet and even in Germany the mobile network should be sufficient for SSH. And when I am offline, I will just have to do something else.</p></div></div>]]>

            <p>The most common piece of advice you'll receive if you want to learn programming is that you should do programming to learn it. While this is well-meaning advice, since doing programming is better than reading about it, it's incomplete.</p>

<p>Following this incomplete advice alone can prevent you from falling in love with programming. One of the worst implementations of this advice is learning programming by solving programming riddles.</p>

<h2>Problems with puzzles</h2>

<p>There are many problems with solving riddles, but let's start with isolation. They are isolated from the real world, so once you complete them, you're done with them. They never change. Real-world software does not behave like this. Real-world software has to deal with the only real constant — change. How adaptable your software is to change will tell you how well you're programming. You don't get this feedback by solving puzzles. Change is a great teacher, and it will teach you about the importance of tests early. Riddles can't teach you that.</p>

<p>The next problem with riddles is that they are too focused on algorithms. Unless you plan to work on algorithm-heavy products like Google Search, you shouldn't focus on that. Sure, that knowledge might get handy for technical interviews with companies that emulate FAANG interview practices, but that's a topic for another article.</p>

<p>Another problem with solving riddles is that they give you the wrong picture of programming. Solving puzzles encourages cleverness, while code that's too clever is a smell in real-world software. If it's difficult to understand for people that have to maintain it (this includes your future self, a more forgetful individual than you might think), it's not well written. As Donald Knuth famously said, "Programs are meant to be read by humans and only incidentally for computers to execute. "Good programmers make their code as easy to understand as possible, and solving riddles discourages that. Solving puzzles encourages the most innovative hacks possible, which is excellent if you want to compete in programming competitions, but real-world software is not like that.</p>

<p>Solving riddles can discourage you from learning to program and falling in love with it. I haven't yet met a programmer who said that solving programming riddles made him fall in love with programming. Maybe they exist, but it's usually something else.</p>

<h2>Importance of having a bigger goal</h2>

<p>Solving riddles is the impulsive implementation of this incomplete advice. You are rushing to do some programming, without having a bigger goal. The problem with this is that it's not sustainable. If you don't have a bigger goal, your motivation will be shallow, and you'll be more likely to quit when things get tough. Having a bigger goal will push you through obstacles.</p>

<p>An excellent bigger goal is solving a problem that's currently painful for you. Your local bus has a shitty website, and you have to search like a madman to find the next bus? Scrape their data and build the one yourself, and you'll never have that problem again. You are searching for a new apartment, but you're getting tired of continually refreshing the website for ads? Build a program that does that for you.</p>

<p>Whatever it is, if there's a real-life problem that you would like to get rid of with some programming, that's much better than solving riddles for the sake of it. By doing this, you'll have a much better picture of what programming is and realize how useful it is.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Streaming systems continuously ingest and process data from a variety of data sources. They build on append-only data structures to enable efficient write and read access, targeting low-latency end-to-end. As more of the data sources in applications are machines, the expected volume of continuously generated data has been growing and is expected to grow further [1][2]. Such growth puts pressure on streaming systems to handle machine-generated workloads not only with low latency, but also with high throughput to accommodate high volumes of data.</p>
<p><a href="https://pravega.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pravega</a>&nbsp;(“good speed” in Sanskrit) is an open-source storage system for streams that we have built from the ground up to ingest data from continuous data sources and meet the <a href="https://pravega.io/docs/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stringent requirements</a> of such streaming workloads. It provides the ability to store an unbounded amount of data per stream using&nbsp;<a href="https://pravega.io/docs/latest/pravega-concepts/#a-note-on-tiered-storage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tiered storage</a>&nbsp;while being <a href="https://pravega.io/docs/latest/pravega-concepts/#elastic-streams-auto-scaling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elastic</a>, <a href="https://pravega.io/docs/latest/pravega-concepts/#architecture">durable</a> and <a href="https://pravega.io/docs/latest/pravega-concepts/#ordering-guarantees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistent</a>. Both the write and read paths of Pravega have been designed to provide low latency along with high throughput for event streams in addition to features such as long-term retention and stream scaling. This post is a performance evaluation of Pravega focusing on the ability of reading and writing.</p>
<p>To contrast with different design choices, we additionally show results from other systems: <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka</a> and <a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/">Apache Pulsar</a>. Initially qualified as messaging systems, both Pulsar and Kafka make a conscious effort to become more like a storage system; they have recently added features like tiered storage. These systems have made fundamentally different design choices, however, leading to different behavior and performance characteristics that we explore in this post.</p>
<p>The main aspects covered in this post and the highlights of our results are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="#pravega-ingestion">Overall ingestion performance</a>.</em>&nbsp;A Pravega writer produces over <strong>1 million events</strong>&nbsp;<strong>per second</strong>&nbsp;<strong>for small events</strong> (100 bytes) and <strong>sustains 350MB/s throughput for large events</strong> (10,000 bytes), both with <strong>single-digit millisecond latency</strong>&nbsp;(at the 95th percentile).</li>
<li><a href="#durability"><em>Durability</em></a>. <strong>Pravega always makes the data durable on acknowledgment</strong>. The write throughput of Kafka is at least 40% less compared to Pravega for a single-segment stream, independent of flushing on every message or not. For a 16-segment stream, the Pravega writer provides comparable throughput to the Kafka writer flushing on every message, but Pravega write latency is lower (<em>i.e.</em>, single-digit millisecond vs. 1+ seconds for Kafka).</li>
<li><em><a href="#dynamic-batching">Dynamically adjusting batches</a>.</em>&nbsp;Pravega <strong>does not</strong>&nbsp;<strong>require a complex configuration for client batching</strong>. The Pulsar client can achieve either low latency or high throughput, but not both. For Kafka, configuring large batches is detrimental for throughput when the application uses routing keys (throughput is 80% lower for a 16-segment stream). In both cases, forcing the user to statically configure batching is undesirable.</li>
<li><em><a href="#high-throughput">Behavior in the presence of large events for throughput-oriented workloads</a>. </em><strong>Pravega obtains up to 350MB/s for a 16-segment stream with 10kB events.&nbsp;</strong>The throughput&nbsp;is 40% higher than the one of Pulsar and comparable to the throughput of Kafka (about 6% difference). However, the latency in the case of Kafka is over 800ms while the one of Pravega is in single-digit milliseconds.</li>
<li><em><a href="#end-to-end-latency">End-to-end latency</a></em>. When tailing a stream, the Pravega reader also provides <strong>single-digit millisecond latency</strong>&nbsp;<strong>end-to-end&nbsp;</strong>while serving data at high throughput. It provides a higher throughput (roughly 80% more) for a single-segment stream when compared to Kafka. For Pulsar, adding partitions and readers leads to lower performance (single-partition case achieves 3.6x the throughput of the 16-segment case).</li>
<li><em><a href="#routing-keys">Use of routing keys</a></em>. <strong>Pravega does not present any significant performance difference when using or omitting routing keys.</strong>&nbsp;For moderate/high throughput rates, Kafka and Pulsar show over 2x end-to-end latency when using routing keys and, specifically for Kafka, a maximum read throughput that is over 37% lower.</li>
<li><em><a href="#historical-catchup">Tiered storage for catch-up and historical reads</a>.</em>&nbsp;Pravega can&nbsp;<strong>catch up with 100GB of historical data dynamically</strong>&nbsp;<strong>while ingesting 100MB per second of new data</strong>. Pulsar with tiering enabled was not able to catch up for the same scenario, inducing a backlog that grows without bounds.</li>
<li><em><a href="#auto-scaling">Performance with auto-scaling</a>. </em><strong>Auto-s</strong><strong>caling is a unique feature of Pravega</strong>. Scaling up a stream provides higher ingestion performance. We show that scaling up a stream using a constant ingestion rate of 100MB/s causes&nbsp;<strong>write latency to drop.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Except when we show time series, we plot latency along with throughput. It is a problem we commonly find across blog posts; they plot either latency or throughput, whereas both are jointly relevant for streaming workloads. For example, the maximum throughput for a given configuration might look very good while the latency is of the order of hundreds of milliseconds to a few seconds. We plot latency-throughput graphs to avoid misleading conclusions. We additionally provide tables with the data points used to complement the plots. The tables give more data than the plots (<em>e.g.</em>, different percentile ranks) for completeness.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Pravega is a complex system, and we encourage the reader to investigate further our documentation, including <a href="https://blog.pravega.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous blog posts</a>. Here, we provide a very brief summary of the write and read paths, along with some key points of Kafka and Pulsar.</p>
<h3>The Pravega write path</h3>
<p>Pravega has different APIs for adding data to a stream. In this section, we primarily focus on the <a href="https://pravega.io/docs/latest/javadoc/clients/index.html"><em>event stream API</em></a>.</p>
<p>The <em>event stream writer&nbsp;</em>writes events to a stream. A stream can have parallel segments that can change dynamically according to an auto-scaling policy. When an application provides routing keys, the client uses them to map events to segments.&nbsp; If the routing key is omitted when writing an event, then the client selects a segment randomly.</p>
<p>The client opportunistically batches event data, and writes such batches to a segment. The client controls when to open new batches and close them, but the data for a batch accumulates on the server. The component in Pravega managing segments is called the <em><a href="https://blog.pravega.io/2019/04/22/events-big-or-small-bring-them-on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">segment store</a></em>. The segment store receives such requests to write to a segment, and both add the data to a cache and appends it to a <em>durable log</em>, currently implemented with <a href="https://bookkeeper.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apache BookKeeper</a>. When appending to the durable log, the segment store performs a second round of batching. We have this second level of aggregation to sustain high throughput for use cases in which the message size is small and possibly infrequent.</p>
<p>The log guarantees durability: Pravega acknowledges events once they are made durable to the log, and uses such logs only for recovery. As the segment store keeps a copy of the written data to its cache, it flushes data out of the cache to tiered storage, called <em>long-term storage </em>(LTS), asynchronously.</p>
<p>BookKeeper splits its storage among journal, entry logger, and index. The journal is an append-only data structure, and it is the only data structure critical for the write path. Entry loggers and indexes are used in the read path of BookKeeper. In Pravega, the BookKeeper read path is only exercised during the recovery of segment stores. Consequently, the capacity of the write path depends primarily on the journal and not the other data structures, setting aside any occasional interference they can induce.</p>
<h3>The Pravega read path</h3>
<p>An application reads events individually using instances of the <em>event stream reader</em>. Event stream readers form part of a reader group and internally coordinate the assignment of stream segments. Stream readers read from the assigned segments, and they pull segment data from the segment store. Each time a reader fetches segment data, it fetches as much as it is available, up to a maximum of 1MB.</p>
<p>The segment store always serves data from the cache. If it is a cache hit, then serving the read does not require an additional IO. Otherwise, the segment store fetches the data from LTS in blocks of 1MB, populates the cache, and responds to the client. The segment store does not serve reads reading data from the durable log.</p>
<h3>Pulsar and Kafka</h3>
<p>Both Pulsar and Kafka define themselves as streaming platforms. Pulsar implements a broker that builds on Apache BookKeeper. The broker builds on the abstraction of a managed ledger, which is an unbounded log comprising BookKeeper ledgers that are sequentially organized. BookKeeper is the primary data store of Pulsar, although it optionally enables as part of a recent feature to <a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/concepts-tiered-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tier data to long-term storage</a>.</p>
<p>Pulsar exposes the topic abstraction, and enables topics to be partitioned. Pulsar producers produce messages to topics.&nbsp; It provides different options for receiving and consuming messages, such as different subscription modes and reading manually from topics.</p>
<p>Kafka also implements a broker and exposes partitioned topics. Kafka does not use an external storage dependency like Pravega and Pulsar; it relies on local broker storage as the primary storage of the system. There is a proposal for <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-405%3A+Kafka+Tiered+Storage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adding tiered storage to Kafka in open-source</a>, but to our knowledge, it is only available as a <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/infinite-kafka-storage-in-confluent-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preview feature in the Confluent platform</a>. Consequently, we only compare tiered storage with Pulsar.</p>
<p>Both Pulsar and Kafka implement client batching, and enable the configuration of such batching. For both, two main parameters control client-side batching:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maximum batch size</strong>: this is the maximum amount of data that the client is willing to accumulate for a single batch.</li>
<li><strong>Maximum wait time or linger</strong>: this is the maximum amount of time that the client is willing to wait to close a batch and submit it.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is an inherent trade-off between maximum batch size and waiting time: larger batches favor throughput in detriment of latency, whereas shorter waiting times have the opposite effect. If batches can be accumulated fast enough, then it is possible to obtain both high throughput and low …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting" id="applying-make-invalid-states-unrepresentable">
  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><time itemprop="datePublished">02 October 2020</time></p>

<p>Here are some real life cases of applying one of my
<a href="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/articles/my-principles-for-building-software/">favourite principles</a>.</p>

<p>I’ll try to update this as I come across good examples.</p>

<h2 id="case-1-contiguous-time-periods">Case 1: Contiguous Time Periods</h2>

<p>A straightforward way to represent a period of time is by its start
and end dates (<code>(Date, Date)</code>):</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/c1.png"></p>

<p>If we need to represent a timeline split in to contiguous periods, it
may be tempting to represent this as a sequence of periods (e.g. <code>List
(Date, Date)</code>):</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/c2.png"></p>

<p>However, with this representation there can be both gaps in the
timeline and overlapping periods:</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/c3.png"></p>

<h3 id="improved-representation">Improved Representation</h3>

<p>We can improve this representation so that the contiguous and
non-overlapping constraints always hold, and we can do this in a way
that may remind you of database normalisation - by removing
redundancy.</p>

<p>In a well formed contiguous timeline, the joint start/end
of the adjacent periods are redundant. Contiguous, non-overlapping
splits can simply be represented by a set of dates (<code>Set Date</code>):</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/c4.png"></p>

<p>You can begin to see how this representation simplifies the system
when you consider how to make a further split in the timeline. In the
list representation, splitting a period requires carefully modifying
the data-structure and ensuring constraints aren’t violated. In the
‘set of dates’ representation you simply add a date to the set.</p>

<p>It is sometimes still useful to represent the periods as a sequence of
start and end dates. It is trivial to project the set of dates in to
this form. As long as the canonical representation is the set, the
constraints will still hold.</p>

<h2 id="case-2-default-contracts">Case 2: Default Contracts</h2>

<p>In this system, a customer pays us a recurring rent based upon a contract.
Contracts last for a fixed amount of time, and when they expire we fall back to
a ‘default contract’. The customer can have many fixed contracts, and can
sign new contracts at any time.</p>

<p>This was represented as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A ‘customers’ table storing
    <ul>
      <li>The customer start date.</li>
      <li>An optional end date, should the customer leave.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A ‘contracts’ table storing
    <ul>
      <li>The contract start date.</li>
      <li>An optional end date, for default contracts that don’t end.</li>
      <li>If it was a ‘fixed’ or ‘default’ contract.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/f1.png"></p>
<p>Customer and contract timelines</p>

<p>This representation allows for some undesirable states that are trivial to prevent:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The customer may have gaps in their contracts.</li>
  <li>A fixed contract may not have an end date.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/f2.png"></p>
<p>Contract gaps</p>

<p>To make matters worse, the API for these contracts allowed you to
modify each individual contract, fixed or default, without guarding against
these states. This shows how a poor choice of
representation propagates itself through the design of a system.</p>

<p>This poor choice was not just a theoretical problem -
gaps in contracts were found on more than one occasion, requiring
hours of engineering effort to hunt down and fix.</p>

<h3 id="improved-representation-1">Improved Representation</h3>

<p>This is easily improved by removing the ‘default’ contracts from the
contract table. If the customer doesn’t have a fixed contract, it is
assumed they are on a default contract:</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/f3.png"></p>
<p>Inferred default contracts</p>

<p>Now there can no longer be any gaps, and 
the end date of a contract no longer needs to be optional as it only represents fixed contracts.</p>

<p>It’s worth reiterating that this representation can be projected in to the previous
representation using a database view if that form is more convenient. What is
important is that the underlying representation enforces these constraints, it
is not important how you view the data.</p>

<p>As with the first case, a better representation makes the manipulation
of the data structure simpler. In this case, adding a new fixed contract is
greatly simplified. There is no need to create or modify default contracts, or ensure
that the contracts are contiguous.</p>

<h3 id="the-influence-of-object-oriented-thinking">The Influence of Object-Oriented Thinking</h3>

<p>If this improvement seems obvious to you, you may wonder how the
original design happened in the first place.</p>

<p>I think this happens because of atomistic, object-oriented thinking.</p>

<p>In this mindset, the fixed contracts are <em>objects</em>, the default contracts are
<em>objects</em>, and each of these concepts must be reified as a row in a table and
never inferred.
There is a distrust of using any features the database
offers beyond storing or retrieving <em>objects</em>.</p>

<p>This approach is antithetical to quality relational design and
the principle of making invalid states unrepresentable.</p>

<p>It may feel “simpler” on some level, as you don’t really need
to think about your design.
However, as we see here, this lack of forethought inevitably
leads to complexity.</p>

<p>Despite being <a target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/the-worlds-most-valuable-brands/#dd07f06119c0">the world’s second-most valuable company,</a> Google’s had a tough month.</p>



<p>The fact that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/24/technology/google-service-outage.html?">a brief service outage in the US</a> made <a target="_blank" href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/1530213/google-gmail-youtube-hangout-crashed-down/">front-page news worldwide</a> goes to show how dependent people have become on Google and its products…</p>



<p>But far more distressing to the C-Suite must be the news that US Attorney General William Barr is hellbent on bringing an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/technology/justice-dept-case-google-search-dominance.html">antitrust lawsuit against Google</a> before the election in November — and maybe as early as the beginning of October.</p>



<p>Barr’s Justice Department has set its sights square on Google’s dominance in search.</p>



<p>At the risk of biting the hand that feeds us, I’m going to take a look at what brought Google to this point — and some possible outcomes of the threats to Google’s monopoly on both search and digital advertising.</p>



<h2><strong>Antitrust and Technology</strong></h2>



<p>In the US, antitrust laws <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/antitrust.asp">date back to the Sherman Act,</a> passed in the 1890s.</p>



<p>Antitrust regulations are designed to protect consumers from the adverse impact of one or less than a handful of companies having a monopoly on an essential product or service.</p>



<p>Monopolies represent a barrier to competition — and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/games/off-site/youarehere/pages/pdf/FTC-Competition_How-Comp-Works.pdf">competition is essential</a> in a free-market economy.</p>

<p>Some of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thebalance.com/monopoly-4-reasons-it-s-bad-and-its-history-3305945">commonly cited adverse effects</a> of a monopoly include price-fixing, inferior products and services, and the stifling of innovation.</p>



<p>The first antitrust lawsuits were brought against <a target="_blank" href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/274/693">International Harvester</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._American_Tobacco_Co.">American Tobacco…</a></p>



<p>Apparently, both farm machinery and cigarettes were both viewed as essential at the turn of the twentieth century.</p>



<p>Antitrust laws are often used to prevent mergers between large companies that might harm consumers.</p>



<p>When oil giants Exxon and Mobil merged in the late 1990s, they were forced to sell 2,431 gas stations before the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dividend.com/how-to-invest/5-major-antitrust-mergers/">$80.3 billion deal</a> was allowed to proceed.</p>



<p>Despite this divestiture, Exxon-Mobil was the world’s most valuable company until <a target="_blank" href="https://money.cnn.com/2012/01/25/markets/apple_stock/index.htm">Apple surpassed it in 2012.</a></p>



<p>Digital technology companies have had their fair share of skirmishes over monopoly and antitrust issues with the government, both in the US and around the world.</p>



<p>IBM faced <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#Twentieth-century_market_power_and_antitrust">over 20 government and private antitrust actions</a> in the 20th century.</p>



<p>On the cusp of the 2000s, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/microsoft-antitrust.asp">Microsoft was sued by the Department of Justice (DoJ)</a> and others to “determine whether the company’s bundling of additional programs into its operating system constituted monopolistic actions.”</p>



<p>These actions were partly a result of the <a target="_blank" href="https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/browser-wars/">“Browser Wars”</a> between Microsoft’s Internet Explorer and their now long-defunct competitor, Netscape.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Microsoft was accused of intentionally making it difficult for consumers to install software from competitors on Windows machines — and delete Microsoft’s bundled programs.</p>



<p>Microsoft <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theringer.com/tech/2018/5/18/17362452/microsoft-antitrust-lawsuit-netscape-internet-explorer-20-years">lost the case,</a> and the judge called for the company to split into two separate entities called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/babybills.asp">Baby Bills</a>, a reference to the “Baby Bells” created when the government broke up AT&amp;T in the 1980s.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Windows OS side of Microsoft’s business was to become a separate corporate entity from the software side.</p>



<p>Ultimately, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/long-antitrust-saga-ends-for-microsoft/">Microsoft settled with the US government</a>, and escaped being split up but it was forced to make <a target="_blank" href="https://www.justice.gov/atr/usdoj-antitrust-division-us-v-microsoft-corporation-information-settlement">significant concessions</a> that limited its anticompetitive tactics.</p>



<p>Many observers speculate that the antitrust lawsuits against Microsoft led to Bill Gates stepping down as CEO.</p>



<p>The lawsuits and settlement also fostered a more competitive environment that allowed fledgling startups like Google, Facebook, and Amazon to survive and thrive.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Threats to Google’s Monopoly on Search and Digital Advertising</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>Antitrust in the US</strong></h3>



<p>Federal government concerns about Google’s dominance in both search and online advertising really began to pick up steam in summer 2019 when the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/technology/justice-dept-case-google-search-dominance.html?searchResultPosition=1">opened antitrust investigations</a> into all of the “Big Four” tech giants.</p>



<p>Additionally, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20857440/google-antitrust-investigation-attorneys-general-advertising-search">Google finds itself targeted for investigation by 50 state attorneys general</a> for its anticompetitive practices, particularly its dominant share of the digital advertising market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Only California and Arizona declined to join the probe.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Top-5-Companies-Search.png" alt="" width="720" height="537" srcset="https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Top-5-Companies-Search.png 560w, https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Top-5-Companies-Search-300x224.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-srcset="https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Top-5-Companies-Search.png 560w, https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Top-5-Companies-Search-300x224.png 300w" data-src="https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Top-5-Companies-Search.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption>(<em>Source: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.geekwire.com/2019/amazon-gaining-google-search-advertising-market-share/">Geekwire</a></em>)</figcaption></figure>



<p>In 2019, Google accounted for a 31.6% market share of overall digital ad spending and a 73.1% share of search advertising.</p>



<p>Google’s dominance in search is even more staggering…</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1000" height="743" src="https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/statistic_id216573_global-market-share-of-search-engines-2010-2020.png" alt="" srcset="https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/statistic_id216573_global-market-share-of-search-engines-2010-2020.png 1000w, https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/statistic_id216573_global-market-share-of-search-engines-2010-2020-300x223.png 300w, https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/statistic_id216573_global-market-share-of-search-engines-2010-2020-768x571.png 768w, https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/statistic_id216573_global-market-share-of-search-engines-2010-2020-600x446.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-srcset="https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/statistic_id216573_global-market-share-of-search-engines-2010-2020.png 1000w, https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/statistic_id216573_global-market-share-of-search-engines-2010-2020-300x223.png 300w, https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/statistic_id216573_global-market-share-of-search-engines-2010-2020-768x571.png 768w, https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/statistic_id216573_global-market-share-of-search-engines-2010-2020-600x446.png 600w" data-src="https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/statistic_id216573_global-market-share-of-search-engines-2010-2020.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption><strong>Global Market Share of Search Engines</strong><em> (Source: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/">Statista</a>)</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>As of July 2020, Google held an 87% market share in desktop search — its nearest competitor, Bing, accounted for just over 6%.</p>



<p>This disparity has led critics of both major political parties, as well as President Donald Trump, to argue that Google needs to be more strictly regulated — or even split up into smaller entities.</p>



<p>There is precedent for breaking up monopolies in the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 1904, John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil controlled <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/15/doj-and-state-ags-likely-to-file-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google-wsj.html">91% of oil production and 85% of oil sales in the US.</a></p>



<p>The Supreme Court ruled in 1911 that Standard Oil was in violation of federal antitrust laws and split the company up into 34 separate entities, including companies that became <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Rockefeller">ExxonMobil and Chevron.</a></p>



<p>In more recent history, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/att-breakup-spinoff.asp">antitrust lawsuits filed in the early 1970s against AT&amp;T</a> — which operated a legal monopoly on local and long-distance telecommunications for almost a century — broke the company up into seven smaller entities known as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/babybells.asp">“Baby Bells.”</a></p>



<p>In addition to the DoJ and State’s attorney investigations into Google, all of the Big 4’s CEOs were recently summoned to appear remotely before Congress’s <a target="_blank" href="https://judiciary.house.gov/subcommittees/antitrust-commercial-and-administrative-law-116th-congress/">House Judiciary subcommittee on Antitrust.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The subcommittee held the hearing after investigating the Big 4 for over a year.</p>



<p>In the current American political environment, where it often seems like Republicans and Democrats agree on practically nothing, the hearing was surprisingly bipartisan.</p>

<p>Here are the elements of Google’s vast empire that are thought to be most vulnerable to punitive antitrust actions.</p>

<h4>Advertising&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Not only does Google command a lopsided market share in both search advertising and digital advertising as a whole, but it also faces investigation because Google effectively owns and controls every aspect of the online marketplace for selling and purchasing advertising.</p>



<p>Google has achieved its advertising hegemony primarily through acquiring competitors, such as it’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wired.com/2008/03/google-seals-do/">2008 buyout of ad-tech firm DoubleClick.</a></p>



<p>Over <a target="_blank" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/266249/advertising-revenue-of-google/">70% of Google’s revenue comes from advertising</a> — over $160 billion in 2019.</p>



<p>Any threat to this income stream could have devastating effects on the value of the company.</p>



<p>Investigators and competitors charge that allowing Google to have such complete control over digital advertising is harmful to competition and gives Google an unfair advantage.</p>



<h4>Content</h4>



<p>Content creators and publishers big and small were likely thrilled when Rep. David Cicilline, chairman of the antitrust subcommittee <a target="_blank" href="https://news.yahoo.com/why-does-google-steal-content-201052393.html">straight up asked Pichai,</a> “Why does Google steal content?”</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, Pichai disagreed with the characterization, but Cicilline rejected his response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Congress, he said, has “heard throughout this investigation that Google has stolen content to build your own business. These are consistent reports, and so your testimony that it doesn’t happen is really inconsistent with what we’ve learned during the course of the investigation.”</p>



<p>As Google continually finds new ways to answer search queries using third party content on its own platform, often without attribution or a link to the source, it seems likely that this strategy will come under growing scrutiny.</p>

<h4>Search</h4>



<p>Google’s near-total dominance of search has led to numerous allegations of anticompetition practices — including favoring its own products above competitors in search results.</p>



<p>Founder’s tales of businesses being decimated by Google’s search manipulation and favoritism towards its own offerings abound online — such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/02/14/googles-anti-competitive-practices-decimates-online-shopping-antitrust-column/4718626002/">this one</a> from the founder of comparison shopping site Kelkoo or this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-google-search-favoritism-20150630-story.html">Harvard and Columbia study funded by Yelp.</a></p>



<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/technology/justice-dept-case-google-search-dominance.html?">According to The New York Times</a>, the DoJ has narrowed its focus to search and may leave action on Google’s advertising practices to the state attorneys, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-doj-idUSKBN22R37I">led by Texas Attorney General, Ken Paxton.</a></p>



<p>Paxton says he has not ruled out any possible punishment, including breaking up the company.</p>



<p>By narrowing the focus to search, the DOJ hopes to have a stronger lawsuit that it can file in a more timely fashion.</p>



<p>The federal case is expected to largely drill down on Google’s agreements with Apple and other companies to have Google set as the default search engine on iPhones and other devices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DoJ will likely argue this an anti-competitive practice that puts other search engines at a significant disadvantage.</p>

<p>One other possible vulnerability regulators might exploit is the ubiquity of Google’s Android mobile operating system.</p>



<p>Android is by far the most popular mobile OS globally, with a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272698/global-market-share-held-by-mobile-operating-systems-since-2009/">74.6% market share.</a></p>



<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tech-antitrust-google-idUSKBN1XO2UQ">Reports say that the state attorneys</a> are also investigating Android for antitrust violations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The EU has already fined Google €4.34 billion for using Android “as a vehicle to cement the dominance of its search engine.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>What is open source</h3><p>Open-source software means that the source code of a software is publicly available. Everyone can read, copy or change the source code which makes the software more trustworthy and long-living than closed source software. Famous and big examples of open-source software projects are the <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linux kernel</a>, <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firefox</a>, <a href="https://git.libreoffice.org/core" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LibreOffice</a> or <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/?format=HTML" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a> but there are also many many small open-source software projects out there.</p><h3>Benefits</h3><p>If you can read code, you are actually able to understand and evaluate what is happening when you execute that software. Not only what the software pretends to do but rather what it really does.</p><p>This feature also allows everyone to scan the source code for security vulnerabilities or other weaknesses of any kind, which adds to the trustworthiness mentioned above.</p><p>Another main advantage is that you are able to request help from basically every user/contributor of that software which is mostly faster and provides more creative solutions than most commercial support.</p><p>Also, the software is not only dependent on the original author and can be maintained and extended by the community. There can be even different versions of the same software with different features. If the community thinks it would not be a good idea to add a specific feature, someone can copy the source code and release their own version of it.</p><p>You can learn a lot, and I mean really a lot! </p><p>Reading and understanding the source code of other programs may not be easy, especially if the software is relative complex, but you will learn a lot in the progress as you are confronted with ideas and solutions from many other people which spend sometimes hours, days or even longer with a specific problem and came up with a solution.</p><p>If you are also willing to contribute and not only to use the software you gain another few advantages.</p><p>You will be forced to think way more about your problem than with closed source. As the software will be used by many other people, it is not only your specific use case which is relevant. This forces you to gain a deeper understanding of the concrete problem and you are also forced to think of reasonable abstractions and edge cases as well as configurability.</p><p>Another important step, which is often not really recognized is that it is not only important to fix the problem or build that feature, it is also very important to write readable and maintainable code, otherwise no one will be able to touch it and as the software evolves it may be removed eventually because no one understands.</p><p>As everyone knows, good documentation is key, you actually need to write documentation, otherwise, no one will be able to use your cool new feature</p><p>and the community of that project will not be happy and may not even merge your cool new feature. This all may sound difficult, but I think you will learn key skills which are important or beneficial for your whole career as a software engineer.</p><p>It is especially beneficial for job applications because others can really see what you are doing rather than just talking about it or even worse, test your skills on a whiteboard.</p><p>Another major advantage is the joy you feel when others actually use the software you have written, especially if it will be used in ways you don't even consider.</p><h3>Disadvantages</h3><p>What may be viewed as a disadvantage is the monetization of your product. As this is true at the first glance, there are also ways of making money with open-source software.</p><p>If your software is a service you could provide a hosted solution where users would have to pay money to use it, but if they really want and have the resources they could also host it themselves.</p><p>On the other hand, you are an expert in using, customizing and developing the software, so if others need support they could hire you to help them.</p><p>Some individuals or companies are also sponsoring open source software maintainer through <a href="https://github.com/sponsors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Sponsors</a> or <a href="https://www.patreon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patreon</a> for example.</p><p>If your software grows and more and more people are contributing to it you will have no other choice than to set up some processes, like: "When is someone allowed to merge a PR?", "Who decides if something will be added or not?", "Who has the last word in case a conflict arises?", "What documentation is mandatory?", "Do we raise money?"(In case of a non-profit open-source project), "What kind of merchandising are producing?" and there are many many more, that are all questions that came to my mind in less than 5 minutes. To set up such rules and processes will feel cumbersome at the beginning, but you will not be able to grow your project without. There is no silver bullet, you will need to think of processes and rules on your own, what is applicable to your project, but sure you can grab inspiration from other open-source software projects.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>Open-source software is very popular because of the trust this gives its users. Contributing to it also has a bunch of advantages for the contributing</p><p>individuals although it is way harder than working on individual and closed source software as you need to pay attention to more and greater details and you can even earn some money with it. </p></div></div>]]>

      <h2>What you could steal from the Kakoune code editor right now, and get away with it</h2>

<p><a href="https://kakoune.org/">Kakoune</a> is a (fairly) young modal code editor
that has matured for as long and as well as a good red wine. It places
multiple-selections, operability and interactivity at the heart of its
distinctive characteristics. It provides users with an efficient and
comfortable text editing experience — but that’s not what this article
is about.</p>

<p>Now 8 years old at the time of writing, Kakoune has gone through several
iterations that removed a dependency here, optimised a core feature there,
even factorised entire parts of its codebase! And as any long-term user
will tell you, it’s easy to take all that good stuff for granted.</p>

<p>So here it is. I’m stopping time for a couple minutes, and listing in
this article a few things that the Kakoune project does well in several
dimensions. Some are technical, but the rest should hopefully be easily
adaptable to other projects (whether they are code editors or not), and
generic enough to be adopted seamlessly.</p>

<p>Now why does the title of this piece mention stealing? Read on, that’s item
number one.</p>

<h2 id="from-its-licensing-model">From its licensing model</h2>

<p>If something doesn’t belong to anybody, is it stealing if you take it for
yourself? What if it belongs equally to everybody?</p>

<p>Fortunately we don’t need to solve that problem: Kakoune is a public domain
project. Which means that anyone is free to do anything they want with the
source code of the editor, no questions asked.</p>

<p>This has several advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the tool can be shipped with any distribution or suite, regardless of
licensing</li>
  <li>users can modify the code (to fix bugs, add new features or tweak already
existing ones etc.) and publish it (or compiled binaries) without worrying
about attribution</li>
  <li>it lifts some weight of responsibility of the maintainer for the whole
project, which anyone can re-brand or heavily modify to their liking</li>
</ul>

<p>Users don’t like paying for tools, and when they are free and open-source,
I’d argue that they turn out to be more useful (with several iterations,
over time) in the end if they place no limits on what users are allowed to
do with the code.</p>

<p>I’m not in favour of abolishing licenses, I think it would be more
productive for everyone if specialised tools were in the public
domain. In fact, the Kakoune project <em>is</em> licensed, under the
<a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/unlicense/">terms</a> of the
<a href="https://unlicense.org/">UNLICENSE</a>, in order to avoid conflicts with
jurisdictions that don’t recognise the <em>public domain</em> model.</p>

<p>As for the small riddle above, that’s a tough one, bordering on the
philosophical, but since we’re talking about replicating data, we can easily
break out of that paradox: copying is not stealing.</p>

<h2 id="from-its-code">From its code</h2>

<p>New comers like to praise Kakoune for having a clean codebase, easy to
navigate and modify. And for good reason! Written in C++, the code uses the
smallest amount of bells and whistles possible to keep the code elegant,
compilable with (reasonably) old compiler versions, but more importantly
convenient.</p>

<p>And when it comes to convenience, Kakoune has some interesting assets your
project could benefit from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a header-only implementation of a diffing algorithm
(<a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/src/diff.hh">diff.hh</a>)</li>
  <li>a regex engine mostly following the ECMA syntax — this implementation
allowed the project to drop
<a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_74_0/libs/regex/doc/html/index.html">boost::regex</a>
as a dependency
(<a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/src/regex.hh">regex.hh</a>)</li>
  <li>a minimal JSON (un)marshaller
(<a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/src/json.hh">json.hh</a>)</li>
  <li>a custom hash map implementation
(<a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/src/hash_map.hh">hash_map.hh</a>)</li>
  <li>wrappers for string types (e.g. string view) and associated utilities:
join, wrap, split, quote, pad etc.
(<a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/src/string.hh">string.hh</a>
· <a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/src/string_utils.hh">string_utils.hh</a>)</li>
  <li>various functional range filters: filter, transform, gather, map etc.
(<a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/src/ranges.hh">ranges.hh</a>)</li>
  <li>an implementation of Go’s defer statement that runs code once the execution
flow leaves the current scope
(<a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec#Defer_statements">Go specification</a>
· <a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/src/utils.hh#L53">utils.hh</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The above snippets are not exactly drop-in, as they are still coupled to
custom types defined for the editor, but should nonetheless be adaptable
without much difficulty to other C++ projects.</p>

<h2 id="from-its-user-interface">From its user interface</h2>

<p>Originally an easter-egg that savvy users found out about by reading the
code that handles the terminal client’s user interface, the Clippy character
has become a mascot that is now enabled out of the box. However, although
it’s undeniable that nostalgia for Microsoft Office’s assistant has fuelled
prolonged interest in Clippy itself, the easter egg’s notoriety has cast a
shadow on the larger feature it’s a prisoner of: the auto-info pop up window.</p>

<p>The auto-info window is a big contributor to the general level of
interactivity the editor provide, as it pops up any time the user hits a
key in normal mode or has typed a function name in the command prompt. Its
purpose is to provide instant feedback to the user, communicate usage
information or possible options that are available to the user. Every time
I’m using a terminal program that lets me type commands but never hints
at what parameters they take, I sorely wished more people would steal that
from Kakoune!</p>

<p>Another command prompt related improvement that the editor proposes is
fuzzy matching: the user doesn’t need to type out letters that make up
the name of the command they need in order, which makes for much faster
completion selection, and increased discoverability.</p>

<p>All command names in Kakoune are WORDS that start with the name of the
functionality group they belong to. The examples below follow:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to figure out what commands interact with the buffer, typing <code>:buff</code>
would return candidates like <code>buffer-next</code>, <code>lint-buffer</code>,
<code>format-buffer</code>…</li>
  <li>to call the <code>lint-buffer</code> command, typing <code>:lb&lt;tab&gt;</code> would insert the
entire command name in the prompt</li>
</ul>

<p>Use Kakoune once, and you’ll wish your browser enabled fuzzy
matching in your history/bookmarks for the rest of your days. But
you might wonder: there are individual tools that handles
fuzzy-matching, like <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim">ctrlp</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/jhawthorn/fzy">fzy</a>, what if the user would rather
use them to handle opening, for example, files? Great question! Read on,
that’s the next dimension I want you to steal from.</p>

<h2 id="from-its-philosophy">From its philosophy</h2>

<p>The UNIX philosophy states that tools should focus on doing one thing,
and do it well. The implications are that tools that implement too many
unrelated features end up providing users with an underwhelming experience
because they only allow so much granularity over their behaviour, and that
their maintainers are spread too thin to improve/fix them.</p>

<p>If we re-frame this into the context of text editing, editors should only
worry about exactly that — text editing. And Kakoune does its job as
a UNIX citizen brilliantly, but it also goes one step further: it allows
other tools to interact with it, via shell scripting.</p>

<p>Remember the case of spawning a third-party fuzzy matching program,
above? Without getting into details, in Kakoune you’d implement that by
spawning a new terminal (or pane/tab), which would run the program, and
its output would be interpreted by the editor. Users are free to run any
program they want, any terminal or multiplexer they prefer.</p>

<p>And the concept isn’t bound to terminal programs either, although they are
probably the type of tools that Kakoune users would intuitively want to
interact with, on account of the editor being one itself. For example, do
you want to edit a file using a graphical interface? Try the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>:edit %sh{zenity --file-selection}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If that doesn’t sound anything special, it means that it makes
sense. Unfortunately, the field of text editors on UNIX systems has over
the years turned into an archipelago, in which every editor aims at being an
island. Job management, shell, terminal emulation,&nbsp;window multiplexing…
Text editors have turned into closed ecosystems (or Integrated Development
Environments) that provide many (sometimes cardboard-looking) features
unrelated to editing, which new comers have to buy into, or be left out in
the cold.</p>

<p>So here’s an idea everybody should not feel guilty about stealing, if
applicable to their projects: don’t re-invent the wheel, we have enough
bad imitations already<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> — instead, work on ways to make your tools
interface with others more easily!</p>

<p>As for the small riddle above, that’s a tough one, bordering on the
philosophical, but since we’re talking about replicating data, we can easily
break out of that paradox: copying is not stealing.</p>

<h2 id="from-its-code">From its code</h2>

<p>New comers like to praise Kakoune for having a clean codebase, easy to
navigate and modify. And for good reason! Written in C++, the code uses the
smallest amount of bells and whistles possible to keep the code elegant,
compilable with (reasonably) old compiler versions, but more importantly
convenient.</p>

<p>And when it comes to convenience, Kakoune has some interesting assets your
project could benefit from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a header-only implementation of a diffing algorithm
(<a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/src/diff.hh">diff.hh</a>)</li>
  <li>a regex engine mostly following the ECMA syntax — this implementation
allowed the project to drop
<a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_74_0/libs/regex/doc/html/index.html">boost::regex</a>
as a dependency
(<a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/src/regex.hh">regex.hh</a>)</li>
  <li>a minimal JSON (un)marshaller
(<a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/src/json.hh">json.hh</a>)</li>
  <li>a custom hash map implementation
(<a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/src/hash_map.hh">hash_map.hh</a>)</li>
  <li>wrappers for string types (e.g. string view) and associated utilities:
join, wrap, split, quote, pad etc.
(<a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/src/string.hh">string.hh</a>
· <a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/src/string_utils.hh">string_utils.hh</a>)</li>
  <li>various functional range filters: filter, transform, gather, map etc.
(<a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/src/ranges.hh">ranges.hh</a>)</li>
  <li>an implementation of Go’s defer statement that runs code once the execution
flow leaves the current scope
(<a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec#Defer_statements">Go specification</a>
· <a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/src/utils.hh#L53">utils.hh</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The above snippets are not exactly drop-in, as they are still coupled to
custom types defined for the editor, but should nonetheless be adaptable
without much difficulty to other C++ projects.</p>

<h2 id="from-its-user-interface">From its user interface</h2>

<p>Originally an easter-egg that savvy users found out about by reading the
code that handles the terminal client’s user interface, the Clippy character
has become a mascot that is now enabled out of the box. However, although
it’s undeniable that nostalgia for Microsoft Office’s assistant has fuelled
prolonged interest in Clippy itself, the easter egg’s notoriety has cast a
shadow on the larger feature it’s a prisoner of: the auto-info pop up window.</p>

<p>The auto-info window is a big contributor to the general level of
interactivity the editor provide, as it pops up any time the user hits a
key in normal mode or has typed a function name in the command prompt. Its
purpose is to provide instant feedback to the user, communicate usage
information or possible options that are available to the user. Every time
I’m using a terminal program that lets me type commands but never hints
at what parameters they take, I sorely wished more people would steal that
from Kakoune!</p>

<p>Another command prompt related improvement that the editor proposes is
fuzzy matching: the user doesn’t need to type out letters that make up
the name of the command they need in order, which makes for much faster
completion selection, and increased discoverability.</p>

<p>All command names in Kakoune are WORDS that start with the name of the
functionality group they belong to. The examples below follow:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to figure out what commands interact with the buffer, typing <code>:buff</code>
would return candidates like <code>buffer-next</code>, <code>lint-buffer</code>,
<code>format-buffer</code>…</li>
  <li>to call the <code>lint-buffer</code> command, typing <code>:lb&lt;tab&gt;</code> would insert the
entire command name in the prompt</li>
</ul>

<p>Use Kakoune once, and you’ll wish your browser enabled fuzzy
matching in your history/bookmarks for the rest of your days. But
you might wonder: there are individual tools that handles
fuzzy-matching, like <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim">ctrlp</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/jhawthorn/fzy">fzy</a>, what if the user would rather
use them to handle opening, for example, files? Great question! Read on,
that’s the next dimension I want you to steal from.</p>

<h2 id="from-its-philosophy">From its philosophy</h2>

<p>The UNIX philosophy states that tools should focus on doing one thing,
and do it well. The implications are that tools that implement too many
unrelated features end up providing users with an underwhelming experience
because they only allow so much granularity over their behaviour, and that
their maintainers are spread too thin to improve/fix them.</p>

<p>If we re-frame this into the context of text editing, editors should only
worry about exactly that — text editing. And Kakoune does its job as
a UNIX citizen brilliantly, but it also goes one step further: it allows
other tools to interact with it, via shell scripting.</p>

<p>Remember the case of spawning a third-party fuzzy matching program,
above? Without getting into details, in Kakoune you’d implement that by
spawning a new terminal (or pane/tab), which would run the program, and
its output would be interpreted by the editor. Users are free to run any
program they want, any terminal or multiplexer they prefer.</p>

<p>And the concept isn’t bound to terminal programs either, although they are
probably the type of tools that Kakoune users would intuitively want to
interact with, on account of the editor being one itself. For example, do
you want to edit a file using a graphical interface? Try the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>:edit %sh{zenity --file-selection}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If that doesn’t sound anything special, it means that it makes
sense. Unfortunately, the field of text editors on UNIX systems has over
the years turned into an archipelago, in which every editor aims at being an
island. Job management, shell, terminal emulation,&nbsp;window multiplexing…
Text editors have turned into closed ecosystems (or Integrated Development
Environments) that provide many (sometimes cardboard-looking) features
unrelated to editing, which new comers have to buy into, or be left out in
the cold.</p>

<p>So here’s an idea everybody should not feel guilty about stealing, if
applicable to their projects: don’t re-invent the wheel, we have enough
bad imitations already<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> — instead, work on ways to make your tools
interface with others more easily!</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Recently, I came across a new embedded analytics database, <a href="https://duckdb.org/">DuckDB</a> which I found inspired from two of my favorite ones <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> and <a href="https://clickhouse.tech/">ClickHouse</a>. DuckDB looked very interesting since I find that it filled that gap of not having a strong embedded database for OLAP requirements really well.</p>
<p>In this post, we will load one month of <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page">NYC Taxi Dataset</a> in each of these three databases and run some queries to get an idea about each of them.</p>
<p>Don’t take it as a performance comparison in any way since SQLite &amp; DuckDB are embedded databases (they don’t have any separate server running) while ClickHouse runs a separate server, so obviously that won’t be apples-to-apples comparison.</p>
<h2 id="data-loading">Data Loading</h2>
<p>Each of the three databases support loading data from CSV files, we used the feature to import data</p>
<pre><code>$ sqlite3 sqlite3.db
SQLite version 3.33.0 2020-08-14 13:23:32
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite&gt; .mode csv
sqlite&gt; .import yellow_tripdata_2009-01.csv taxi
</code></pre>
<pre><code>$ duckdb duckdb.db
SQLite version DuckDB d9bceddc7
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
duckdb&gt; CREATE TABLE taxi AS SELECT * FROM read_csv_auto('yellow_tripdata_2009-01.csv');
</code></pre>
<p>For ClickHouse, we need to create the table beforehand with proper schema. In this case, I used all fields as strings since we aren’t thinking about any performance optimization.</p>
<pre><code>$ clickhouse-client
server :) CREATE TABLE default.taxi
(
    `vendor_name` String,
    `Trip_Pickup_DateTime` String,
    `Trip_Dropoff_DateTime` String,
    `Passenger_Count` String,
    `Trip_Distance` String,
    `Start_Lon` String,
    `Start_Lat` String,
    `Rate_Code` String,
    `store_and_forward` String,
    `End_Lon` String,
    `End_Lat` String,
    `Payment_Type` String,
    `Fare_Amt` String,
    `surcharge` String,
    `mta_tax` String,
    `Tip_Amt` String,
    `Tolls_Amt` String,
    `Total_Amt` String
)
ENGINE = MergeTree()
ORDER BY vendor_name
SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192

$ cat yellow_tripdata_2009-01.csv | clickhouse-client --query="INSERT INTO taxi FORMAT CSVWithNames";
</code></pre>
<h2 id="data-storage">Data Storage</h2>
<p>Let’s have a look how much disk each of these took to store this csv in their native data format.</p>
<p>The csv file which we imported above is around 2.4G.</p>
<pre><code>$ du -sh yellow_tripdata_2009-01.csv
2.4G	yellow_tripdata_2009-01.csv
</code></pre>
<p>In SQLite format, it took around 2.7G.</p>
<pre><code>$ ls -lh
Permissions Size User    Date Modified Name
.rw-r--r--  2.7G pradeep  4 Oct 12:30  sqlite3.db
</code></pre>
<p>In DuckDB format, it took around 1.9G.</p>
<pre><code>$ ls -lh
Permissions Size User    Date Modified Name
.rw-r--r--  1.9G pradeep  4 Oct 12:20  duckdb.data
.rw-r--r--    12 pradeep  4 Oct 13:03  duckdb.data.wal
</code></pre>
<p>In ClickHouse format, it took around 780M.</p>
<pre><code>$ clickhouse-client
server :) SELECT
    concat(database, '.', table) AS table,
    formatReadableSize(sum(bytes)) AS size,
    sum(rows) AS rows,
    sum(bytes) AS bytes_size,
    any(engine) AS engine,
    formatReadableSize(sum(primary_key_bytes_in_memory)) AS primary_keys_size
FROM system.parts
WHERE active
GROUP BY
    database,
    table
ORDER BY bytes_size DESC

┌─table────────────────┬─size───────┬─────rows─┬─bytes_size─┬─engine────┬─primary_keys_size─┐

</code></pre>
<h2 id="data-query">Data Query</h2>
<h3 id="counting-number-of-rows">Counting number of rows</h3>
<p>Let’s make a simple query to count the number of rows in each of three datastores.</p>
<p>In SQLite, it took around 1 second to complete the query.</p>
<pre><code>sqlite&gt; .timer on
sqlite&gt; SELECT COUNT(*) from taxi;
14092413
Run Time: real 1.053 user 0.291249 sys 0.759388
</code></pre>
<p>In DuckDB, the same query took around around 0.043 second.</p>
<pre><code>duckdb&gt; .timer on
duckdb&gt; SELECT COUNT(*) from taxi;
14092413
Run Time: real 0.043 user 0.042005 sys 0.000352
</code></pre>
<p>Wow, that’s around 20x faster.</p>
<p>In ClickHouse, the same query took around 0.006 second.</p>
<pre><code>$ clickhouse-client
server :) SELECT count(*) FROM taxi;
┌──count()─┐
│ 14092413 │
└──────────┘
1 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.006 sec.
</code></pre>
<h3 id="counting-distinct-rows">Counting distinct rows</h3>
<p>Let’s make a query to count distinct rows for column: vendor_name.</p>
<pre><code>sqlite&gt; SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT vendor_name) FROM taxi;
3
Run Time: real 2.027 user 1.392251 sys 0.630733
</code></pre>
<pre><code>duckdb&gt; SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT vendor_name) FROM taxi;

└────────────────────────┘
1 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.121 sec. Processed 14.09 million rows, 169.11 MB (116.89 million rows/s., 1.40 GB/s.)
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s make a query to count distinct rows for multiple columns.</p>
<pre><code>sqlite&gt; SELECT
   ...&gt;   COUNT(DISTINCT vendor_name),
   ...&gt;   COUNT(DISTINCT Passenger_Count),
   ...&gt;   COUNT(DISTINCT Trip_Distance),
   ...&gt;   COUNT(DISTINCT Rate_Code),
   ...&gt;   COUNT(DISTINCT store_and_forward),
   ...&gt;   COUNT(DISTINCT Payment_Type)

<pre><code>duckdb&gt; SELECT

   ...&gt;   COUNT(DISTINCT Rate_Code),
   ...&gt;   COUNT(DISTINCT store_and_forward),
   ...&gt;   COUNT(DISTINCT Payment_Type)
   ...&gt; FROM taxi;

1 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.595 sec. Processed 14.09 million rows, 1.07 GB (23.69 million rows/s., 1.80 GB/s.)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Based on above data, we are conclude that DuckDB is a very good fit for analytical purposes. Although, it’s still in early phase of development, I am really excited about it. I am looking forward to use it in my projects soon.</p>

<p>This chapter is an attempt to illustrate what are the core principles of Data Oriented Programming as I understand them.
It is highly influenced by my programming experience in Clojure, but I believe that those principles are language agnostic.</p>
<p>One could adhere to them in an Object Oriented (OO) language like Java or C# and one could break them
in a Functional Programming (FP) language like Ocaml, Haskell, JavaScript (or even in Clojure).</p>
<p>In fact, in this chapter, I am going to illustrate how those principles could be applied or broken
in JavaScript, a programming language that supports both FP and OOP.</p>
<p>The principles of Data Oriented (DO) Programming are:</p>

<p>Each principle is explored in a separate article.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p><span color="#663300">ENCYCLICAL LETTER<i><br> <b><span size="4">FRATELLI TUTTI<br> </span></b></i>OF THE HOLY FATHER<br> <b>FRANCIS<br> </b>ON FRATERNITY AND SOCIAL FRIENDSHIP</span></p> 
 
<p>1. <i><a name="“FRATELLI_TUTTI”">“FRATELLI TUTTI”</a>.</i><a name="_ftnref1" title="" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> With these words, Saint Francis of Assisi addressed his brothers and sisters and proposed to them a way of life marked by the flavour of the Gospel. Of the counsels Francis offered, I would like to select the one in which he calls for a love that transcends the barriers of geography and distance, and declares blessed all those who love their brother “as much when he is far away from him as when he is with him”.<a name="_ftnref2" title="" href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> In his simple and direct way, Saint Francis expressed the essence of a fraternal openness that allows us to acknowledge, appreciate and love each person, regardless of physical proximity, regardless of where he or she was born or lives.</p> 
<p>2. This saint of fraternal love, simplicity and joy, who inspired me to write the Encyclical <i> <a href="http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html">Laudato Si’</a></i>, prompts me once more to devote this new Encyclical to fraternity and social friendship. Francis felt himself a brother to the sun, the sea and the wind, yet he knew that he was even closer to those of his own flesh. Wherever he went, he sowed seeds of peace and walked alongside the poor, the abandoned, the infirm and the outcast, the least of his brothers and sisters.</p> 
<p><a name="WITHOUT_BORDERS">WITHOUT BORDERS</a></p> 
<p>3. There is an episode in the life of Saint Francis that shows his openness of heart, which knew no bounds and transcended differences of origin, nationality, colour or religion. It was his visit to Sultan Malik-el-Kamil, in Egypt, which entailed considerable hardship, given Francis’ poverty, his scarce resources, the great distances to be traveled and their differences of language, culture and religion. That journey, undertaken at the time of the Crusades, further demonstrated the breadth and grandeur of his love, which sought to embrace everyone. Francis’ fidelity to his Lord was commensurate with his love for his brothers and sisters. Unconcerned for the hardships and dangers involved, Francis went to meet the Sultan with the same attitude that he instilled in his disciples: if they found themselves “among the Saracens and other nonbelievers”, without renouncing their own identity they were not to “engage in arguments or disputes, but to be subject to every human creature for God’s sake”.<a name="_ftnref3" title="" href="#_ftn3">[3]</a> In the context of the times, this was an extraordinary recommendation. We are impressed that some eight hundred years ago Saint Francis urged that all forms of hostility or conflict be avoided and that a humble and fraternal “subjection” be shown to those who did not share his faith.</p> 
<p>4. Francis did not wage a war of words aimed at imposing doctrines; he simply spread the love of God. He understood that “God is love and those who abide in love abide in God” (<i>1 Jn </i>4:16). In this way, he became a father to all and inspired the vision of a fraternal society. Indeed, “only the man who approaches others, not to draw them into his own life, but to help them become ever more fully themselves, can truly be called a father”.<a name="_ftnref4" title="" href="#_ftn4">[4]</a> In the world of that time, bristling with watchtowers and defensive walls, cities were a theatre of brutal wars between powerful families, even as poverty was spreading through the countryside. Yet there Francis was able to welcome true peace into his heart and free himself of the desire to wield power over others. He became one of the poor and sought to live in harmony with all. Francis has inspired these pages.</p> 
<p>5. Issues of human fraternity and social friendship have always been a concern of mine. In recent years, I have spoken of them repeatedly and in different settings. In this Encyclical, I have sought to bring together many of those statements and to situate them in a broader context of reflection. In the preparation of <i> <a href="http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html">Laudato Si’</a></i>, I had a source of inspiration in my brother Bartholomew, the Orthodox Patriarch, who has spoken forcefully of our need to care for creation. In this case, I have felt particularly encouraged by the Grand Imam Ahmad Al-Tayyeb, with whom I met in Abu Dhabi, where we declared that “God has created all human beings equal in rights, duties and dignity, and has called them to live together as brothers and sisters”.<a name="_ftnref5" title="" href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> This was no mere diplomatic gesture, but a reflection born of dialogue and common commitment. The present Encyclical takes up and develops some of the great themes raised in the Document that we both signed. I have also incorporated, along with my own thoughts, a number of letters, documents and considerations that I have received from many individuals and groups throughout the world.</p> 
<p>6. The following pages do not claim to offer a complete teaching on fraternal love, but rather to consider its universal scope, its openness to every man and woman. I offer this social Encyclical as a modest contribution to continued reflection, in the hope that in the face of present-day attempts to eliminate or ignore others, we may prove capable of responding with a new vision of fraternity and social friendship that will not remain at the level of words. Although I have written it from the Christian convictions that inspire and sustain me, I have sought to make this reflection an invitation to dialogue among all people of good will.</p> 
<p><a name="7">7</a>. As I was writing this letter, the Covid-19 pandemic unexpectedly erupted, exposing our false securities. Aside from the different ways that various countries responded to the crisis, their inability to work together became quite evident. For all our hyper-connectivity, we witnessed a fragmentation that made it more difficult to resolve problems that affect us all. Anyone who thinks that the only lesson to be learned was the need to improve what we were already doing, or to refine existing systems and regulations, is denying reality.</p> 
<p>8. It is my desire that, in this our time, by acknowledging the dignity of each human person, we can contribute to the rebirth of a universal aspiration to fraternity. Fraternity between all men and women. “Here we have a splendid secret that shows us how to dream and to turn our life into a wonderful adventure. No one can face life in isolation… We need a community that supports and helps us, in which we can help one another to keep looking ahead. How important it is to dream together… By ourselves, we risk seeing mirages, things that are not there. Dreams, on the other hand, are built together”.<a name="_ftnref6" title="" href="#_ftn6">[6]</a> Let us dream, then, as a single human family, as fellow travelers sharing the same flesh, as children of the same earth which is our common home, each of us bringing the richness of his or her beliefs and convictions, each of us with his or her own voice, brothers and sisters all.</p> 
<p><a name="CHAPTER_ONE">CHAPTER ONE</a></p> 
<p><a name="DARK_CLOUDS_OVER_A_CLOSED_WORLD">DARK CLOUDS OVER A CLOSED WORLD</a></p> 
<p>9. Without claiming to carry out an exhaustive analysis or to study every aspect of our present-day experience, I intend simply to consider certain trends in our world that hinder the development of universal fraternity.</p> 
<p><a name="SHATTERED_DREAMS">SHATTERED DREAMS</a> </p> 
<p>10. For decades, it seemed that the world had learned a lesson from its many wars and disasters, and was slowly moving towards various forms of integration. For example, there was the dream of a united Europe, capable of acknowledging its shared roots and rejoicing in its rich diversity. We think of “the firm conviction of the founders of the European Union, who envisioned a future based on the capacity to work together in bridging divisions and in fostering peace and fellowship between all the peoples of this continent”.<a name="_ftnref7" title="" href="#_ftn7">[7]</a> There was also a growing desire for integration in Latin America, and several steps were taken in this direction. In some countries and regions, attempts at reconciliation and rapprochement proved fruitful, while others showed great promise.</p> 
<p>11. Our own days, however, seem to be showing signs of a certain regression. Ancient conflicts thought long buried are breaking out anew, while instances of a myopic, extremist, resentful and aggressive nationalism are on the rise. In some countries, a concept of popular and national unity influenced by various ideologies is creating new forms of selfishness and a loss of the social sense under the guise of defending national interests. Once more we are being reminded that “each new generation must take up the struggles and attainments of past generations, while setting its sights even higher. This is the path. Goodness, together with love, justice and solidarity, are not achieved once and for all; they have to be realized each day. It is not possible to settle for what was achieved in the past and complacently enjoy it, as if we could somehow disregard the fact that many of our brothers and sisters still endure situations that cry out for our attention”.<a name="_ftnref8" title="" href="#_ftn8">[8]</a></p> 
<p>12. “Opening up to the world” is an expression that has been co-opted by the economic and financial sector and is now used exclusively of openness to foreign interests or to the freedom of economic powers to invest without obstacles or complications in all countries. Local conflicts and disregard for the common good are exploited by the global economy in order to impose a single cultural model. This culture unifies the world, but divides persons and nations, for “as society becomes ever more globalized, it makes us neighbours, but does not make us brothers”.<a name="_ftnref9" title="" href="#_ftn9">[9]</a> We are more alone than ever in an increasingly massified world that promotes individual interests and weakens the communitarian dimension of life. Indeed, there are markets where individuals become mere consumers or bystanders. As a rule, the advance of this kind of globalism strengthens the identity of the more powerful, who can protect themselves, but it tends to diminish the identity of the weaker and poorer regions, making them more vulnerable and dependent. In this way, political life becomes increasingly fragile in the face of transnational economic powers that operate with the principle of “divide and conquer”. </p>

  <p>A basic property of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature">digital signature scheme</a> is that it should specify which signatures are valid and which signatures are invalid, so that all implementations can accept only valid signatures and reject only invalid signatures. <em>Unfortunately, Ed25519 signatures don’t provide this property, making their use in distributed systems fragile and risky.</em></p>
<p>Although the scheme was standardized in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032">RFC8032</a>, the RFC does not specify validation criteria, and does not require conformant implementations to agree on whether a particular signature is valid. In addition, because the specification changed validation criteria years after deployment, it is incompatible with almost all existing implementations. Worse still, some implementations added extra ad-hoc criteria, making them further incompatible.</p>
<p>The result is an extremely wide variation in validation criteria across implemententations. The diagram below plots verification results of a \(14 \times 14\) grid of edge cases, with light squares representing accepted signatures, and dark squares representing rejected ones. As the diagram illustrates, verification results are generally inconsistent not just between implementations, but also between different versions and different modes. <img src="https://hdevalence.ca/images/ed25519-comparison.png"></p>
<p>Some protocols may tolerate this variation, but it is unacceptable for any protocol that requires participants to reach consensus on signature validity. A malicious participant can submit signatures that are accepted by some implementations but rejected by others, causing a network partitition or a consensus fork. Having only a single implementation makes this problem less obvious, but it doesn’t go away, since behavior can vary across versions of the ‘same’ implementation. This occurred in practice with the widely used <code>libsodium</code> library, which made breaking changes to validation criteria in a point release.</p>
<p>Finally, although all of these problems occur when verifying signatures individually, they also prevent the use of batch verification, which can provide a significant performance benefit.</p>

<h2 id="the-scope-of-potential-divergence">The scope of potential divergence</h2>
<h3 id="the-ed25519-signing-process">The Ed25519 signing process</h3>
<p>Before explaining the validation criteria, it’s useful to briefly review the signing process. An honest signer generates their signing key, a random scalar \(a\), through a complicated procedure not relevant here. Then, they multiply their signing key by the Curve25519 basepoint \(B\) to obtain their verification key, a curve point \(A = [a]B\). The <em>signing</em> and <em>verification</em> keys are more commonly referred to as the <em>private</em> and <em>public</em> keys, but (following Daira Hopwood), I prefer to use the capability-based terminology, since it more precisely captures the role of the key material.</p>
<p>To sign a message <code>M</code>, a signer first generates a secret random nonce \(r\), through a procedure that is also not relevant here, and then form a public commitment to this randomness by computing \(R = [r]B\). Next, they use a hash function \(H\) to compute a challenge scalar as \( k \gets H(R, A, M) \). Finally, they compute a response scalar as \( s \gets r + ka \).</p>
<h3 id="divergence-in-ed25519-signature-validation-criteria">Divergence in Ed25519 signature validation criteria</h3>
<p>To understand the scope of potential divergence in validation criteria, let’s walk through the steps to verify a signature <code>sig</code> with verification key \(A\) on the message <code>M</code>, noting each step with a possibly divergent behavior choice. Then, in subsequent sections, we’ll look at the scope and implications of each divergence.</p>
<p>Ed25519 signatures are 64 bytes long, structured as two 32-byte components: <code>sig = R_bytes || s_bytes</code>. The first 32 bytes store an encoding of \(R\), and the second 32 bytes store an encoding of \(s\). Ed25519 verification keys are 32 bytes long, storing an encoding of \(A\).</p>
<p>Next, the verifier parses <code>s_bytes</code> as \(s\). It’s always possible to interpret a byte string as a little-endian encoded integer, so parsing \(s\) can’t fail. However, \(s\) is supposed to represent an integer \(\mod q\), where \(q\) is the order of the prime-order subgroup of Curve25519. Honestly-generated signatures will have \(0 \leq s &lt; q\), and implementations can choose to reject \(s \ge q\). Call this check <em>canonical \(s\)</em>.</p>
<p>Next, the verifier attempts to parse <code>A_bytes</code> as \(A\). Not all byte strings are valid point encodings, so parsing \(A\) can fail, causing the signature to be rejected. Points can be encoded non-canonically, although in contrast to the encoding of \(s\), the mechanism is somewhat more complicated and subtle, as will be described <a href="#canonical-a-r">below</a>. Implementations can choose to reject non-canonically encoded curve points. Call this check <em>canonical \(A\)</em>.</p>
<p>The verifier then uses <code>A_bytes</code>, <code>R_bytes</code>, and the message <code>M</code> to recompute the challenge value \(k \gets H(R, A, M)\). (Note that since \(H\) is a hash function, it actually operates on the encodings <code>A_bytes</code> and <code>R_bytes</code>, not their decoded internal representations).</p>
<p>Implementations then make a <em>choice of verification equation</em>, choosing which of two verification equations to check. They can use either the <em>batched equation</em> \[ [8]R = [8]([s]B - [k]A), \] or the <em>unbatched equation</em> \[ R = [s]B - [k]A. \] The naming of <em>batched equation</em> versus <em>unbatched equation</em> suggests that the difference is related to batched versus individual verification, but in fact these give different behavior even in the case of individual verification, as will be explained <a href="#choice-of-verification-equation">below</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, to actually check whichever equation is used, an implementation must choose an <em>equality check</em>. Recall that we didn’t actually decode <code>R_bytes</code> to \(R\) yet. When using the batched equation, an implementation must operate on \(R\), so it must decode <code>R_bytes</code> to \(R\), and check equality of curve points. This also means it must make a choice of whether to require <em>canonical \(R\)</em>.</p>
<p>When using the unbatched equation, however, an implementation can choose to either check equality of curve points, or to compute \(R’ \gets [s]B - [k]A\), encode \(R’\) to <code>Rprime_bytes</code>, and check equality of byte strings. When \(R\) is canonically encoded, these equality checks produce the same result. But because the encoding procedure produces canonical encodings, if <code>R_bytes</code> contains a non-canonical encoding of \(R\), then even if \(R’ = R\) (as curve points), <code>Rprime_bytes</code> may differ from <code>R_bytes</code> (as byte strings).</p>
<h3 id="points-of-potential-divergence">Points of potential divergence</h3>
<p>In summary, there are a number of points of potential divergence between implementations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Whether to require <em>canonical \(s\)</em> or to allow non-canonical encodings.</li>
<li>Whether to require <em>canonical \(A\)</em> or to allow non-canonical encodings.</li>
<li>The <em>choice of verification equation</em>, either <em>batched</em> or <em>unbatched</em>.</li>
<li>The <em>choice of equality check</em>, and the related choice of <em>canonical \(R\)</em>.</li>
<li>Any other <em>ad-hoc checks</em> added by a particular implementation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before comparing the choices made by RFC8032 and actually existing implementations, let’s examine the exact mechanism and implications of each of these points of potential divergence.</p>
<h3 id="canonical-s">Canonical \(s\)</h3>
<p>The values <code>A_bytes</code>, <code>R_bytes</code>, and <code>M</code> are all fed into the hash function, so they cannot be modified without changing the challenge value. However, a third party could replace \(s\) with \(s’ = s + nq\). Because \(s’ \equiv s \pmod q\), the modified signature \((R, s’)\) would still pass verification. Requiring that <code>s_bytes</code> encodes \(s &lt; q\) prevents this.</p>
<p>This check is simple, low-cost, prevents malleability, is required by RFC8032, and is performed by most implementations. The only notable exception is the original reference implementation of Ed25519, which chose to write a paragraph arguing that signature malleability is never a problem instead of performing the check.</p>
<p>Because this check is fairly common, well-known, and unobjectionable, I didn’t focus on it, and didn’t comprehensively test implementation behavior.</p>
<h3 id="canonical-a-r">Canonical \(A\), \(R\)</h3>
<p>While the mechanism for constructing non-canonically encoded scalar values is fairly simple, the mechanism for constructing non-canonically encoded point values is somewhat more complicated, as mentioned <a href="#divergence-in-ed25519-signature-validation-criteria">above</a>. To explain it, we need to describe the “compressed Edwards \(y\)” encoding used by Ed25519.</p>
<p>Curve25519 is defined over the finite field of order \(p = 2^{255} - 19\), so the coördinates of curve points \((x,y)\) are integers \(\mod p\). The curve equation in (twisted) Edwards form is \[ - x^2 + y^2 = 1 + d x^2 y^2, \] where \(d\) is a curve parameter. This means that \[ x^2 = \frac { y^2 - 1} {d y^2 + 1}. \] If the fraction on the right-hand side is nonsquare, then there is no \(x\) so that the right-hand side equals \(x^2\), and the \(y\) value is not the \(y\)-coördinate of a curve point. If it is square, then there is a square root \(x\), and the value of \(y\) is sufficient to recover \(x\) up to a choice of sign.</p>
<p>Because \(p &lt; 2^{255}\), the encodings of field elements fit in 255 bits. The compressed Edwards \(y\) format uses the first 255 bits to store the \(y\) coördinate, and the 256th bit to indicate the sign of the \(x\) …</p></div></div></div></div>

        <p>Static websites are still a hot topic. They are fast, and they’re incredibly secure because there isn’t a CMS to hack. Once you build a static website, however, the question becomes: Where do I host?</p>

<p>In other words: what is the fastest static website hosting provider in 2020? Well, let’s find out!</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I did <a href="https://www.savjee.be/2017/10/Static-website-hosting-who-is-fastest/">a similar test in 2017</a>, so it will be curious to see if the hosting providers have been improving.</p>

<h2 id="test-setup">Test setup</h2>
<p>Just like in 2017, I created a simple webpage that I could host on many services. I opted to use my own homepage, including all the images, CSS, and JS files. I then uploaded these files to the following hosting providers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Pay-as-you-go</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank" data-no-instant="data-no-instant">AWS S3</a> (Region: <code>eu-west-1</code>, Ireland)</li>
      <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/" target="_blank" data-no-instant="data-no-instant">AWS CloudFront</a></li>
      <li>
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage" target="_blank" data-no-instant="data-no-instant">Google Cloud Storage</a> (regional bucket, <code>europe-west1</code>, Belgium)</li>
      <li>
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage" target="_blank" data-no-instant="data-no-instant">Google Cloud Storage</a> (multi-region bucket)</li>
      <li>
<a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/sites" target="_blank" data-no-instant="data-no-instant">Cloudflare Workers Sites</a> ($5/month)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<strong>Freemium (some parts free)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting" target="_blank" data-no-instant="data-no-instant">Firebase Hosting</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn/" target="_blank" data-no-instant="data-no-instant">Cloudflare CDN</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn/" target="_blank" data-no-instant="data-no-instant">Netlify</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Free</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" data-no-instant="data-no-instant">GitHub Pages</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Quick note</em>: I did not test Microsoft Azure, because I couldn’t sign up for it with my <a href="https://revolut.com/referral/xavierh5x" target="_blank" data-no-instant="data-no-instant">Revolut Visa card</a>. Thanks, Microsoft!</p>

<p>To check the performance, I used Pingdom and <a href="https://ohdear.app/" target="_blank" data-no-instant="data-no-instant">Oh Dear</a>. Pingdom measures uptime and response times from <a href="https://my.pingdom.com/probes/feed" target="_blank" data-no-instant="data-no-instant">their worldwide network of probe servers</a> while Oh Dear is located in a single location.</p>

<p>Some other things to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I tested the HTTPS endpoints for all services</li>
  <li>I added <code>index.html</code> to all URL’s, meaning no time wasted resolving the index document</li>
  <li>The services were probed <strong>once every minute</strong> for <strong>10 days</strong>
</li>
  <li>Oh Dear did not only track response times, but also DNS lookup time,  TCP connection time, content download time, and more. Pretty cool! All of the raw data is available at the end of this post.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Pingdom or Oh Dear did NOT sponsor this blog post in any way! <a href="https://ohdear.app/" target="_blank" data-no-instant="data-no-instant">Oh Dear</a>, however, gave me a free trial with enough slots for all the test sites. Thanks a lot!</p>

<h2 id="expectations">Expectations</h2>
<p>My expectations are pretty much aligned to when I did this last time around:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I expect paid services to do better than free servers. There must be a reason for the prices they charge, right?</li>
  <li>Firebase and Google Cloud belong to the same company, so I expect them to perform similarly.</li>
  <li>I use CloudFront for my website, so hopefully they don’t come out as a bad option. Otherwise, there’s some additional homework for me ;)</li>
  <li>Netlify performed quite inconsistently last time around. With a few years passing, I hope they were able to address those issues.</li>
  <li>Last time, I didn’t have Cloudflare in the benchmark. I expect them to be a strong contender, given how popular they are and how many edge locations they have.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>Here’s a screenshot from the Pingdom dashboard after 10 days of testing:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.savjee.be/uploads/2020-05-28-benchmaring-static-website-hosting-providers/pingdom-overview.png" alt="Overview of the Pingdom dashboard">
<em>Overview of the Pingdom dashboard</em></p>

<p>At first glance, it seems that all services perform very consistently, with CloudFront, GitHub Pages, and Google Cloud, leading the pack. But let’s not jump to conclusions.</p>

<h3 id="uptime">Uptime</h3>
<p>Let’s start with uptime. All of these services had 100% uptime, except for Firebase. Pingdom detected 1 minute of downtime. One check returned, “Network is unreachable,” and the other returned “Invalid certificate.”</p>

<p><img src="https://www.savjee.be/uploads/2020-05-28-benchmaring-static-website-hosting-providers/pingdom-error-log.png" alt="Firebase downtime as reported by Pingdom">
<em>Firebase downtime as reported by Pingdom</em></p>

<p>This was not detected by Oh Dear, so I’m willing to give Firebase the benefit of the doubt and say that this was an issue on Pingdom’s side.</p>

<h3 id="response-times">Response times</h3>
<p>Let’s start with some basic statistics: the median, and average response time of each service (including standard deviation):</p>

<p><img src="https://www.savjee.be/uploads/2020-05-28-benchmaring-static-website-hosting-providers/chart-response-times.png" alt="Median response times, measured by Pingdom">
<em>Median response times as reported by Pingdom</em></p>

<p>A few things might catch your attention:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CloudFront &amp; GitHub Pages are speedy and consistent. They have the lowest median, average, and deviation. Interesting because one is a paid service, while the other is completely free.</li>
  <li>AWS S3 is the slowest of them all (but performs consistently). It is kind of expected from a hosting provider that is located only in a single region (in this case Ireland, <code>eu-west-1</code>)</li>
  <li>Google Cloud’s regional and multi-regional buckets perform fairly alike. Interestingly, both are much faster than S3, which is a comparable service. Is Google doing some caching behind the scenes?</li>
  <li>I expected Cloudflare to be much more competitive with the top rankings, but somehow both their CDN and Workers aren’t the top performers. Their Workers product does, however, perform slightly better than their CDN.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since I used both Pingdom and Oh Dear, let’s check the difference in median response times:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.savjee.be/uploads/2020-05-28-benchmaring-static-website-hosting-providers/chart-response-times-pingdom-oh-dear.png" alt="Pingdom vs Oh Dear (median response times)">
<em>Pingdom vs Oh Dear (median response times)</em></p>

<p>Interestingly, Oh Dear is reporting much faster response times compared to Pingdom. This is probably related to the fact that they only test from a single (apparently very well connected) location.</p>

<p>Pingdom is testing from various locations around the world, some of which aren’t as well connected, which increases the response times.</p>

<p>Some additional findings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Somehow, AWS S3 is the fastest performer, even though the content is only hosted in a single location. It also outperformed Amazon’s CDN! Wherever Oh Dear is hosted, it must be somewhere in the EU with good connections to the Ireland region of AWS.</li>
  <li>The difference between CloudFront, S3, Firebase, GitHub Pages, and Google Cloud Storage is minimal. Once more, showing that free and paid services compete quite closely with one another.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="time-to-first-byte">Time to first byte</h3>
<p>Oh Dear also kept track of other metrics like how long it took for the first bytes to start being transferred. This can give us an indication of how responsive the webserver is (how long does it need to think before being able to fulfill a request).</p>

<p><img src="https://www.savjee.be/uploads/2020-05-28-benchmaring-static-website-hosting-providers/chart-time-to-first-byte.png" alt="Time to first byte: measures responsiveness of web servers">
<em>Time to first byte: measures responsiveness of web servers</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>The “simple” storage services like S3 and Google Cloud Storage are doing very well.</li>
  <li>Once again, GitHub Pages, Firebase, and CloudFront are great performers, delivering the first byte in under 40ms.</li>
  <li>Surprisingly, Cloudflare is taking quite a while to start delivering the first bytes. Maybe this is due to all of their protection services?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="compared-to-2017">Compared to 2017</h3>
<p>Comparing this new data with the one from 2017 reveals that not much has changed. Note that here I’m comparing the data from Pingdom:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.savjee.be/uploads/2020-05-28-benchmaring-static-website-hosting-providers/chart-response-times-2017-vs-2020.png" alt="Benchmark from 2017 vs 2020: median response times">
<em>Benchmark from 2017 vs 2020: median response times</em></p>

<p>All providers (except GitHub Pages) have become slightly slower. Most noticeably AWS S3 (+13%) and Firebase (+31%). The others are so close to their 2017 performance that I would consider these differences to be in the margin of error.</p>

<p>Netlify has a slower median response time in 2020 compared to 2017. But it did improve massively on its consistency. Last time around, they had weird spikes in performance but not anymore. Nice!</p>

<p>This could be explained by Pingdom having added additional test servers located in areas that are further away from these providers.</p>

<h3 id="trying-to-find-edge-cases">Trying to find edge cases</h3>
<p>A scatter plot reveals that there aren’t many outliers, and no service is suffering from regular spikes in performance. There are some outliers here and there, but I wouldn’t look into them too much:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.savjee.be/uploads/2020-05-28-benchmaring-static-website-hosting-providers/chart-scatter-response-times.png" alt="Scatter plot of all response times">
<em>Scatter plot of all response times</em></p>

<p>If we visualize the response times with a box plot, we see something interesting:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.savjee.be/uploads/2020-05-28-benchmaring-static-website-hosting-providers/chart-boxplot-response-times.png" alt="Box plot of response times, showing some high spikes">
<em>Box plot of response times, showing some high spikes</em></p>

<p>All services, except for AWS, GitHub Pages, and Firebase, have weird spikes. Last time around, this was only limited to Netlify. Not sure what to make of these, but I’m guessing it’s more related to Pingdom’s tests than to the services themselves.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Time to draw some conclusions:</p>

<p>The best all-around performer is <strong>AWS CloudFront</strong>, followed closely by <strong>GitHub Pages</strong>. Not only do they have the fastest response times (median), they’re also the most consistent.</p>

<p>They are, however, closely followed by Google Cloud Storage. Interestingly, there is very little difference between a regional and multi-regional bucket. The only reason to pick a multi-regional bucket would be the additional uptime guarantee.</p>

<p><strong>Cloudflare</strong> didn’t perform as well I would’ve expected. It’s certainly faster than a standard S3 bucket but falls away when compared to other CDN’s like CloudFront. Their Workers product is slightly faster than their CDN, but it’s hard to recommend it when it costs $5 a month, and free products like GitHub Pages perform better.</p>

<p>Netlify has improved big time; the spikes in performance are gone and performs in line with Google Cloud and Firebase hosting.</p>

<h2 id="which-should-you-choose">Which should you choose?</h2>
<p>If you want a fast website without breaking the bank, go for GitHub Pages. It’s completely free and super fast. It does, however, require you to open source your site.</p>

<p>If that’s not doable, CloudFront is a good alternative, but its price depends on how much bandwidth you push around. For most personal sites, CloudFront won’t cost more than a couple of dollars per month. The same thing goes for Google Cloud Storage.</p>

<p>Netlify and Firebase Hosting are pretty solid choices as well. While they don’t perform as well as CloudFront or GitHub Pages, they make up for it with excellent development tools. Everything works out-of-the-box with no configuration required on your end. Just push your website live with their easy to use CLI tools.</p>

A classic book called Foundations of Mechanical Accuracy described this and other concepts in detail. It’s available as a PDF <a href="http://frank.villaro-dixon.eu/public_upload/Foundations%20of%20Mechanical%20Accuracy%20by%20Wayne%20R%20Moore%20-%201970.pdf">here</a> and in print <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006CAKT8/ref=as_li_tl?camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0006CAKT8&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;linkId=9a3b69c12fefcdb4c52fac9cb6d7d37d&amp;tag=eweinhoffer-20">here</a>.</p><p>Typically made of granite, surface plates act as a datum, or the basis upon which precise measurements and movements can be made. They can be finished to a variety of grades of flatness, based on their intended use, and can even be used to <a href="https://youtu.be/sFrVdoOhu1Q?t=378" target="_blank">build up precise structures</a>&nbsp;(that whole video is a must-watch, btw). When dealing with such flat surfaces, tiny imperfections or gradual wear can have drastic effects: using a gauge over the same spot on a surface plate, or leaving it in a space where the temperature varies by more than a few degrees, can negatively affect their flatness. Due to this, calibrating and conditioning your plate is important. The process is really neat, partially because it requires an autocollimator and an incredibly precise repeat-o-meter. Watch a great video from Tom Lipton about the process <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWqThb9Z1jk">here</a>.</p><p>The neat thing about surface plates is that they do not require precision tools to create. By using the “three plate method”, developed by Joseph Whitworth, flat surfaces can be created by using gravity and a simple hand-scraping tool, or by lapping the plates against each other. By starting with three plates of relative flatness, rubbing the plates against each other in alternating pairs to remove the high spots can yield fantastic results.&nbsp;</p><p>The process can be completed in six steps, and then repeated until the desired level of flatness is achieved. In this visual explanation, the surface finishes of the three plates are exaggerated. Before beginning this process, the three plates (Red, Green and Blue) should be machined or ground to as flat a surface as possible, to remove all unnecessary lapping work. In addition, a fine abrasive compound is often used between plates to assist in material removal. Tom also has <a href="https://youtu.be/rHmsQEAx16o" target="_blank">a great video series</a> about this, which includes some compound and technique recommendations.</p><h3><strong>STEP 1</strong></h3><p>To begin, the Red and Green plates are lapped against each other in an alternating manner. That is, one plate remains stationary while the other is lapped against it, and then the opposite is performed:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1501464915476_27886"><div><p>At the completion of this step, the Red and Green plates “agree with” each other, but that is all.</p><h3><strong>STEP 2</strong></h3><p>Next, the Red plate acts as the control (it remains stationary) while the Blue plate is lapped against it:</p></div></div><div data-aspect-ratio="61" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1501464915476_70590"><div>

<p>These days, I <em>almost</em> exclusively run Arch Linux in my homelab and personal machines.
Had I the brain cells to spare, I’d try and get NixOS running on ARMv7, but in the meantime, a mix of vanilla x86_64 Arch and Arch Linux ARM is my chosen flavor just to keep things consistent.
I’ve run Arch as my primary server OS for almost a decade now, and although I’m sure some will balk at the idea, I’ve found that the distribution has performed wonderfully for me, even in contrast to traditional “server” distributions like CentOS.
It sounds counterinuitive, but the simple model of Arch Linux has, overall, helped mitigate some maintenance burdens.</p>

<p>Here’s some of best practices I’ve accumulated over the years of personally administering ~20 Arch Linux machines in my homelab.</p>

<h3 id="prelude-why-arch">Prelude: Why Arch?</h3>

<p>I don’t want to get into a distribution holy war here; there’s endless forums for that debate.
However, I <em>will</em> get into the reasons why I now default to Arch Linux when provisioning hosts, as many of those reasons naturally flow into why I include certain best practices.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A “rolling release” distribution is a nice methodology for server maintenance.
<a href="https://rootco.de/2020-02-10-regular-releases-are-wrong/">See this other blog post enumerating why rolling releases make sense within the context of openSUSE</a>.
Want a “version”? Use the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Linux_Archive">Arch Linux Archive</a> to pinpoint a moment in time.
(I still begrudge that CentOS 6’s upgrade path to 7 discourages in-place upgrades)</li>
  <li>In contrast to “kitchen sink” distributions, when I <em>do</em> need to bolt on additions to my install, I know exactly how I’ve done it, so fixing problems and building systems isn’t a game of guesswork about how the distribution chose to configure those services.
I’m the one that did it, so I can better maintain it.</li>
  <li>The catalog of packages, when you factor in the AUR, is almost complete for most people.
When I can’t find an Arch package, which is very seldom these days, I package it on the AUR and move on - <code>PKGBUILD</code>s aren’t terribly difficult to write.</li>
  <li>The aforementioned simplicity of Arch systems is also reflected in the Arch-specific software projects like <code>pacman</code>.
Setting up a private pacman repo within my LAN was so easy I thought I was doing something wrong.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pacman-hygiene">Pacman Hygiene</h3>

<p>One of the trickiest aspects of Linux distribution maintenance that I didn’t understand was keeping configuration files up to date.
By that I mean catching and updating files somewhere like <code>/etc/</code> so that when package <code>foobar</code> upgrades from 1.0 to 2.0 and the default configuration file <code>/etc/foobar.conf</code> adds the setting <code>telemetry = true</code>, you can merge in the new configuration files and optionally set them to desired values.</p>

<p><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman/Pacnew_and_Pacsave">The Arch Wiki has a good page about this</a> but the most important thing to remember is that, in the vast majority of cases, an interactive process (via a human at a terminal) is needed to judge which parts of your existing configuration file needs to be edited.
I suggest using <a href="http://kmkeen.com/pacmatic/">pacmatic</a> for this.
The pacmatic web site outlines how to use the utility, but in short: <code>pacmatic</code> will a) alert you to any announcements from the Arch Linux project in case there’s news about needed intervention in the course of normal system operations and b) automatically prompt and help update configuration files.
I like this method because it’s closely linked to <code>pacman</code> operations so you can’t forget to update these files and the <code>pacmatic</code> command is a drop-in replacement for <code>pacman</code>.</p>

<p><code>pacmatic</code> is starting to age a little, but you can still get the same effect by using the <code>pacdiff</code> command from the <code>pacman-contrib</code> package.</p>

<h3 id="aur-automation">AUR Automation</h3>

<p>Using Arch for non-trivial use-cases is almost certainly going to lead you towards relying on some <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/">AUR</a> packages.</p>

<p>Unlike official packages that are curated by Arch Linux Trusted Users, the AUR has less control surrounding submission of packages.
Validating the legitimacy of a <code>PKGBUILD</code> is <em>always</em> a good idea, and for first-time users, building and installing an AUR package is typically comprised of a) downloading the package snapshot, checking out the <code>PKGBUILD</code>, and building it with <code>makepkg</code>.</p>

<p>That’s all well and good, but if you use a non-trivial number of AUR packages, this process is <em>way</em> too manual.
You really want some automation in place around this, but I’m not talking about a tool like <code>yay</code> that automates the fetching and building for a package’s source.
You need a tool that handles all update steps as part of a schedule so that installing updated AUR packages is inlined as part of the normal <code>-Syu</code> process.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the most reliable option here is <a href="https://github.com/alexheretic/aurto">aurto</a> (which, in turn, uses <a href="https://github.com/AladW/aurutils">aurutils</a> under the hood).
Why should you use something like <code>aurto</code>?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scheduled updates. <code>aurto</code> comes bundled with systemd timers to check for package updates, so you don’t burn time checking for updates and building packages manually.</li>
  <li>Custom repositories. Following the Arch paradigm of building and indexing packages into proper repositories means that you don’t think about pulling in updates, they just happen for you. You can also easily share built packages across a network (which I rely on heavily).</li>
  <li><code>aurutils</code> follows lots of good operational hygiene (for example, building in clean chroots and explicitly trusting maintainers as a build step).</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember that, like any sort of AUR automation, you’re trusting the maintainer of the packages you track to not bundle malicious code, but that’s a risk you take with any sort of interaction with the AUR.</p>

<h3 id="snapshotting">Snapshotting</h3>

<p>If you’re using Linux in 2020, there’s no reason why you can’t be using a modern, advanced, copy-on-write filesystem.
Are you comfortable relying on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Kernel_Module_Support">dkms</a>?
Then use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenZFS#Distributions">ZFS on Linux</a>.
Honestly, it’s fantastic, and you get copy-on-write, snapshots, compression, and more.
It’s the current best-of-breed filesystem for Linux, in my opinion.
If you want, <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Btrfs">btrfs</a> can fit a similar role, but I trust ZFS more.</p>

<p>Providing a point-in-time backup before system upgrades becomes <em>extremely</em> easy on these filesystems.
Run a snapshot as a pacman hook before you make changes, and you can rollback to a known good state easily.
There are some ready-made packages out there that stitch together ZFS/btrfs with pacman hooks so you don’t even need to write the automation yourself.</p>

<p>If you’re already snapshotting a filesystem, cheap (as in effort) backups are just a small extra step if you want to replicate the snapshot images somewhere else.
My ZFS and btrfs filesystems get duplicated offsite over simple <code>ssh</code> commands as added disaster recovery insurance, which means that not only do you have system backups saved outside your network, but your whole history of backups if you need to restore from a point in time.
There are actually a wide variety of projects that do this, but personally, I use <a href="https://github.com/khenderick/zfs-snap-manager">zfs-snap-manager</a> for my zpools and <a href="https://github.com/csirac2/snazzer">snazzer</a> for my btrfs volumes.
Both automate retention and incremental backups, which are the tricky parts.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Some of these suggestions eat up disk space.
I’d definitely suggest using filesystem compression to help with that.</p>

<h3 id="grab-bag">Grab Bag</h3>

<p>The preceding three points have had the greatest impact on my Arch Linux system maintainability, but there are a few minor mentions just for sake of completeness:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Remember to run <code>pacman -Sc</code> every once in a while.
Those old packages take up space.</li>
  <li>A periodic <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Reflector">reflector</a> script can be handy in keeping your mirrorlist healthy.</li>
  <li>Using <code>aurto</code> and <code>aurutils</code> to host a repository of local AUR packages? Share it on your network easily:</li>
</ul>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="console"><span>  $</span><span> </span><span>sudo </span>pacmatic <span>-S</span> darkhttpd
<span>  $</span><span> </span><span>sudo </span>systemctl edit darkhttpd
<span>  [Service]
  ExecStart=
  ExecStart=/usr/bin/darkhttpd /var/cache/pacman --ipv6 --uid http --gid http --chroot --mimetypes /etc/conf.d/mimetypes
</span><span>  $</span><span> </span><span>sudo </span>systemctl <span>enable</span> <span>--now</span> darkhttpd
<span>  </span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Then just add the following section to your other machines’ <code>pacman.conf</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ini">  <span>[aurto]</span>
  <span>Server</span> <span>=</span> <span>http://&lt;hostname&gt;/aurto</span>
  <span>SigLevel</span> <span>=</span> <span>Optional</span>
  </code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>Edits</strong>: rhysperry​111 <a href="https://forum.tjll.net/t/tyblog-industrial-strength-arch-linux/235/4">caught</a> a <code>systemctl</code> typo, and AladW <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/j4hqj2/industrial_strength_arch_linux/g7j7im6/">noted I conflated</a> <code>aurto</code> and <code>aurutils</code> in a few places.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-74174200445ef6e30546"><div><p>This blog post is very late. It’s well over a year since<a href="https://twitter.com/colmmacc/status/1153727018896244736"> I posted a coding challenge on twitter</a>. The idea was simple, I’ve always felt that code readability is undervalued so I figured I’d put cold hard cash up. I announced a $1,000 pot, divided into $500, $300, and $200 prizes for the most readable implementations of <a href="https://lemire.me/blog/2019/06/06/nearly-divisionless-random-integer-generation-on-various-systems/">Daniel Lemire’s nearly divisionless algorithm for selecting a random number from an interval.</a> I now have winners to announce and congratulate, and they’re in this blog post, but there’s more to this story.</p><p>I didn’t know it at the time but I’d end up reviewing the entries with colleagues to see if they could follow what was happening (spoiler: they couldn’t). When people got stuck, we’d whiteboard&nbsp;our way through so that we could better understand why and where people were getting stuck. Oh, to be able to whiteboard in person again!  </p><p>I learned a lot about how people think through problems, and that process led to me writing a seperate implementation of Lemire’s Algorithm, with a twenty-to-one comment to code ratio (that’s a lot of comments), and finding a sort-of security issue with the algorithm in the process. I say “sort of” because you really have a ridiculously enormous struggle to find a case where it’s going to be practical to exploit. But it still surprised me, and you probably can’t use Lemire’s algorithm in Vegas.</p><h4>Why Lemire’s Algorithm?</h4><p>I chose Lemire’s algorithm because it is brilliant. When I read Lemire’s code I get that kind of brain-tingling and gawk at the sheer “How on earth did someone think of this” of it all. Lemire has a mastery of code and how code is executed, and then pairs that with transcendent creativity and concision.  Lemire also writes well, and the papers that accompany his code and algorithms are easily some of the most cogent and approachable you’ll find in academia. They are short and clear and avoid the jargon and obtuseness that plagues the field, while containing just enough formalism to be rigorous.</p><p>Lemire’s algorithm is a solution to the problem “Give me a random number between 0 and N, not including N itself”. For simulating a dice, N would be 6 and you’d get back either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 with equal probability. Computers like to start at zero. We can always add one to the result to get the familiar results you’d get on a real dice. I’ve worked on random number generators and written quite a few. In 20 years of doing that, I’d never come across a solution as cool as Lemire’s.</p><p>Before Lemire, the best-known solutions to this problem required one or two divisions per number generated. You probably learned long division when you were quite young. You may remember that it can be get pretty tedious and cumbersome. It’s the same for computers. Division is actually one of the slowest things we can ask a computer to do. Lemire avoids division by translating numbers into a much larger number “space” and using binary-friendly powers-of-two operations instead. His technique almost always avoids needing a division.</p><p>The second reason I chose Lemire’s algorithm is that it is impenetrable upon first reading. There are lucky few people who are so practiced and conversant in number manipulation that they can see inside of algorithms like Neo in the matrix, but I don’t mean them. To the average reader, myself included, it’s not clear what’s going on and why.</p><p>Lemire’s reference code is fourteen lines long, like a sonnet. Twelve of the lines are simple, and any proficient programmer could tell <em>what</em> they are doing. Two specific lines of the code are pretty hard to decipher.. But the real difficulty is how hard it is to understand <em>why</em> all 14 lines are doing what they are doing, and <em>why</em> it results in a fair and correct algorithm for choosing a random number.</p><div><p>As a case in point, if you read the comments to Lemire’s blog, you’ll find several misunderstandings of the code. That’s within an audience of primed Lemire fans and critics who are familiar with the field. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10941">Lemire’s accompanying paper</a> is great and very readable, but it still takes effort and concentration to follow everything. I work on cryptography and write cryptographic code for a living and I’m not ashamed to tell you it took me about 3 readings to really get it. The algorithm is based on an interaction between two modular spaces, one of which is sized 2 to power of 64, and the other is “N” sized, and if I just totally lost you there, I beg forgiveness and if you bear with me I promise there’s a link to my detailed dissection of how and why everything works. </p><p>All of this makes Lemire’s algorithm a really good challenge for creating a more readable version. Ideally something that an average coder can read in one pass, understand, and agree that it’s correct. </p></div><h4>Why does readability matter?</h4><p>Code readability is the most important pillar of code correctness and maintainability. When code is unreadable, it is harder to spot errors. That’s true when you’re doing a code review and it’s even more true when you’re adding more code to an existing code base. Great testing can compensate for some of the correctness challenges, but it doesn’t do as much for maintainability. </p><p>In s2n, one of our <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/s2n/blob/main/docs/DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md">development principles</a> is to write clear readable code with a light cognitive load. We’re serious about it, and I wasn’t going to try and use Lemire’s algorithm in s2n without a very readable implementation.</p><p>Working in software development I’ve heard the opinion more than once about how programmers and coders should be more familiar with the fundamental mathematics of logic and number theory that underpin their field, and that academic style papers and explanations should be sufficient. I happen to work with teams that are made up of both expert coders and expert mathematicians, and even there I don’t think this is a good idea.</p><p>Software engineering is engineering, which means translating science into solutions that work in the real world.  To wildly generalize, there are better dividends to be found in focusing on deepening ones understanding of the “real world” part of that, the users, the customers, the business models, usability, ergonomics, and so on, than on the “science” part of that. Some science is needed, but there’s a shallow limit. Just as a civil engineer doesn’t need too detailed an understanding of the chemistry of concrete. PHs and setting times, but not quantum numbers.</p><p>Code should be self-documenting. The average programmer, including someone straight out of college, should be able to understand and work on a well put-together codebase. This greatly improves the odds of finding problems, and that’s what matters. </p><h4>The contest</h4><p>One of the reasons I’ve been so tardy about this blog post is that the contest didn’t go as I’d expected. </p><p>Let’s start with the great thing that happened. I got several submissions, more than enough to pick winners from. Many of these submissions are good and do improve upon Lemire’s code. The most common improvement was to use more descriptive names for the variables. Lemire uses variable names such as “s”, “t”, “l” which seemingly don’t correspond to much. In such a short piece of code, this actually isn’t too big an offense. I kept these terms in my own implementation, because I want to be consistent with the paper, but it’s absolutely a valid improvement. Another great improvement is to write and include tests, which is really an essential part of software development. </p><p>The first place <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/98183e47436699f6e5eab200061c46eec342806e/std/rand.zig#L74-L118">winner</a> did both of these, and also cleared up some of the confusing lines of code by making an implicit truncation explicit. According to GitHub the winner had 5 contributors, but twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/komu_wairagu/status/1161643573223317504">komu_wairagu</a> submitted it, so that’s who I’ll be contacting to Venmo $500.</p><p>The second place <a href="https://github.com/nimia/Lemire_RNG">winner</a> comes from <a href="https://twitter.com/NimrodAviram">Nimrod Aviram</a>, who I know professionally as the discoverer of the DROWN vulnerability and fun person to hang out with at RealWorldCrypto. Nimrod’s implementation includes some great testing too.</p><p>The third place winner wants to stay anonymous, and cheated their way to some bonus points by writing a great implementation in LISP. How can you not love that? If they change their minds about anonymity I’ll update this post with a link. The sha256 checksum of their implementation is ae008644b2f0b10eddbbce3a0508b103b19925e4e0c9354c569ff0816acb760c. </p><p>Now on to the not as great, and one of the reasons I’ve taken this long to write. It doesn’t feel right to criticize any of these efforts, made in spare time and as part of a fun challenge I put out there, but none of them actually explained Lemire’s algorithm or broke down how and why it worked. I asked several colleagues to look through these implementations and tell me if they understood what was going on, and the response was a uniform zero. Noone could fully understand even one of the implementations, or Lemire’s original.  When I asked people to also read the paper, things got a bit better, but everyone still seemed to trip on some issues.  These are smart people who absolutely know what they are doing. I’m sure given more time they could fully understand everything, but that wasn’t the goal. The goal was to have understanding after one or two, or at most just a few, readings.</p><h4>What did people find hard to follow?</h4><p>Talking through things with people I found some common problems. Some directly in the code, and others in the paper. The first line of code that threw people was:</p><pre><code>uint64_t l = ( uint64_t ) m;</code></pre><p>This line of code does an unusual operation called truncation. It takes a 128-bit value “m” and truncates that to its least significant 64-bits. All of this is implicit in the code, rather than explicit. Reading the code, you have to recall that m is 128-bits. Then there’s also the question of why are we doing this truncation? I’ll leave that for a minute. </p><p>The next problematic line of code was:</p><pre><code>uint64_t t = -s % s;</code></pre><p>This line of code is using an unusual combination of unary negation, on an unsigned int, and the modulus operator.  Nobody remembers what unary negation does to an unsigned int - and why should they …</p></div></div></div>

<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> The sky over California is reddish brown. An army of nearly 20,000 firefighters has been battling against wildfires that have already charred over 3 million acres, destroyed over 6,000 houses and driven thousands of residents to flee. How could this happen?</p>


<p><strong>Pyne:</strong> California is built to burn, to burn explosively. That is a condition of its physical geography. And then we have decided to meet that implacable force with another one, a society that wants to live there&nbsp;-- and how it chooses to do so. We have relied on firefighting agencies to stand between&nbsp;those two forces. And I think they are reaching the point that they cannot do that.</p>

<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Were the fires triggered by climate change?</p><p><strong>Pyne:</strong> Climate change is one factor among many others; it acts as a performance enhancer for fires. This is the fourth year of serial conflagrations. and that is quite remarkable. California would have a bad year and then five or seven or 10 years would pass. Now, we're four years running and there's no reason to think it's going to end.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Can the cooling off in the fall calm the situation?</p><p><strong>Pyne:</strong> No, the dry katabatic winds like the Santa Ana and the Diablo, especially, increase the wildfire risk, and the wind season is just beginning. The losses could double before the calendar year ends.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Even without climate change, California would be burning just as badly as it does now, Danish academic&nbsp;Bjørn Lomborg&nbsp;recently wrote in an editorial. Much bigger wildfires than today were already raging over a hundred years ago.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Pyne:</strong> No, it’s nonsense, to dismiss climate change, of course it plays a role as a performance enhancer. It is true, especially in the 19th century, there was a whole wave of huge mega fires, which often claimed many more lives than today. But at that time, the driving force was the new railroad lines, which opened up the land and triggered a wave of settlement,&nbsp;accompanied by the immense load of debris or slash left by land-clearing and logging. Sometimes more than 400 people died in a single fire. This phase continued into the 1930s. Since then,&nbsp;those conditions have passed&nbsp;and wildland fire fighting has been professionalized and expanded, and California is probably the world leader in this field. So, it looked like the problem was solved, but it wasn't. There are many reasons for this, including the fact that California’s&nbsp;wildfire season now lasts over a month longer than it did then.</p>

<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> President Trump remarked that the fire crisis could have been averted by simply "cleaning your floors” and clearing out some trees and dead underbrush that can act as fuel for a fire.</p><p><strong>Pyne:</strong> That is not&nbsp;wholly&nbsp;wrong.&nbsp;But&nbsp;even if we improve the forest, we're going to be dealing with a worsening climate. In the current political situation, the fires are being misused to redirect to a political agenda. For some, it is all about climate change, for others it is all about logging more. But the issue is much more complex. We are all gathering around the fire, so to speak, everyone is commenting on it, but they all have their backs to the flames. Many people are just using the fire to animate some other message for their particular group. And that does nothing to solve the fire problem.&nbsp;What we need is for everybody to turn around, look at the flames.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Would it make sense to start regularly controlled fires to reduce the dry biomass, as is done in Florida, for example?</p><p><strong>Pyne:</strong> Yes, prescribed burning makes&nbsp;sense. Florida has&nbsp;a culture of burning that was never extinguished because of ranchers&nbsp;and&nbsp;a lot of favorable conditions.&nbsp;They don't have mountains. They don't have Santa Ana winds. They don't have the concentration of people in the interior.&nbsp;In fact, the&nbsp;saying&nbsp;was Florida burned twice a year because they would burn the same place more than once. So, the state forester of Florida once declared that 100 and 115 percent of the state had burned last year.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>In California, on the other hand, there are many mountainous regions, there are these strong Santa Ana winds, and many people live inland, in the Central Valley, in the Los Angeles basin, where the air quality is notoriously bad, even without fires. And now we're going to put millions or tens of millions of acres to deliberate burning?</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> If prescribed fires can prevent the big conflagrations, where does the strong aversion come from?</p><p><strong>Pyne:</strong> A very important impulse came from&nbsp;Europe. Bernhard Eduard Fernow, a Prussian forestry official who&nbsp;married an American,&nbsp;came to the United States in 1876, and was soon naturalized. He headed the Bureau of Forestry, which was a small agency in the Department of Agriculture. When&nbsp;America’s&nbsp;National Forests were actually transferred to its jurisdiction,&nbsp;it was renamed the Forest Service and headed by Gifford Pinchot, an American who trained in forestry in Europe.&nbsp;But Fernow also brought with him his Central European convictions. The problem was that&nbsp;the place he grew up in&nbsp;is a temperate climate. It's very unusual in the world because it does not have wet and dry periods regularly. So, the only fires that occur in your part of the world are ones set by people. So, fire was seen as a social problem, a problem of social order and disorder. Fernow looked at the American fire scene and declared that it was all a problem of "bad habits and loose morals.” Well, that’s a great phrase. But it was totally inappropriate.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> But Fernow is celebrated in America as a pioneer of forestry science.</p><p><strong>Pyne:</strong> Yes, he and his colleagues were smart, committed people, but they had no sense of how fire actually functioned&nbsp;outside of Europe. He didn't understand the ecological role of fire. Many Europeans regarded landscape as a kind of garden and&nbsp;contained fire by intensive cultivation. There's a tradition in European agronomy that really dislikes fire because it's messy. Potentially dangerous. It seems irrational. And there was a very clear distinction made by the 18th century that if you use fire, you are primitive. But in many regions of the world, fire simply belongs to the landscape. And relying exclusively on keeping fire out of the landscape does not work in the long run.</p>

<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> How did you become a fire historian?</p><p><strong>Pyne:</strong> When I started, the subject didn’t exist yet.&nbsp;It began for me when&nbsp;I was 18, just out of high school, and&nbsp;I worked&nbsp;as a firefighter on the north rim of the Grand Canyon. A lot of people did it for two years. Very few people did it for three. I did it for 15,&nbsp;moving between the&nbsp;wildfire season&nbsp;and the university. I didn't see any reason why I should&nbsp;not&nbsp;continue as long as I&nbsp;went&nbsp;to graduate school and the rest of it. We were a small team&nbsp;that did&nbsp;initial attack (the initial response to a wildfire). At that time,&nbsp;our&nbsp;biggest forest fires were perhaps 300 acres (about 200 soccer fields). That's ridiculously small by today’s standards. Most forest fires were triggered quite naturally by lightning.&nbsp;The part of firefighting I enjoyed most was what&nbsp;is&nbsp;called "size up.” It's when you first reach the fire and you have to make quick judgments. There would be two of us. Can we contain this fire? Do we need to call for some retardant? Do we need reinforcements? If so, what kind?&nbsp;If we&nbsp;can't contain the fire, where do we stop it next? Where do we make a stand?</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> How did that shape your thinking?</p><p><strong>Pyne:</strong> We developed a very close relationship with fire as part of the landscape: How will it behave? We often sat around the campfire at night and talked endlessly about fire. But what I learned was there was a kind of relationship with fire. And I learned to talk about fires the way most ordinary people would not. You know, there&nbsp;were&nbsp;really sweet fires. There were miserable fires. This was a fun fire. This was a real gut-wrenching fire. You know, this one&nbsp;just kicked us up and down the hill for a week. We were quite isolated at the rim,&nbsp;although there were many tourists and accommodations. It&nbsp;may be&nbsp;hard for people&nbsp;today to appreciate our isolation. We had newspapers that were two or three days old. We certainly had no television. We had no Internet. We had no private phones. It&nbsp;was a great life. Who cared? I&nbsp;learned&nbsp;about the lunar landing in 1969 from <em>Time</em> magazine, which I read days later.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> The coronavirus pandemic is often compared to a forest fire. Is that an apt metaphor?</p><p><strong>Pyne:</strong> Yes. Maybe this metaphor even works the other way around: To me, Fire is the <em>other contagion</em>.&nbsp;Wildfires can be described as a kind of infection! But fire is a lot like&nbsp;a&nbsp;virus. It's not alive, but it depends on the living world to spread.&nbsp;And if we start controlled fires to prevent bad fires with good fire, it is similar to an annual flu shot or herd immunity. And then how do we respond to it? Well, you are wearing masks that protect against ember spread. Social distancing. Well, that's like defensible space. Unfortunately, fire research is dominated by physicists and chemists, and we would need biologists to study how fire behaves in an ecosystem -- and how to contain fire with ecological interventions. The corona epidemic can help to find a new language to talk about fire.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Having a personal server can have a lot of advantages, but also a lot of weakness:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are running a server <strong>all the time</strong>, even when no one is using your product.</li>
<li>You have to pay, <a href="https://www.webhostingsecretrevealed.net/website-hosting-cost/#5">sometimes a lot</a>.</li>
<li>You have to configure everything yourself and do some <em>sysadmin</em> work.</li>
<li>Resources allocated to your server are limited, and if you have a spike in usage, it may crash.</li>
</ul>
<p>For these reasons, building a WEB API can be unnecessarily long and expensive.  </p>
<p>The truth is that you may not need any server at all.<br>
What if I told you that it’s possible to code and deploy a performant WEB API  in seconds, without any cost?</p>

<p>To show you how, we are going to build a Serverless API and deploy it on Vercel.</p>
<p><strong>But what’s Serverless?</strong><br>
<a href="https://serverless-stack.com/">Serverless Stack</a> describes Serverless as “<em>an execution model where the cloud provider is responsible for executing a piece of code by dynamically allocating the resources</em>”. In other words, <em>Cloud Providers</em> such as <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> take care of everything, from resource management to deployment.</p>
<p>In this article, you’ll learn how to build a simple WEB API which send random lyrics from <em>Pop Smoke</em> (R.I.P 🕊).
We’ll code it in <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.Js</a> and use the <a href="https://genius-lyrics.zyrouge.gq/">genius-lyrics API</a>.
Again, all this in seconds, without paying anything.</p>

<p>As you can see, no need to add an API key to make <a href="https://genius-lyrics.zyrouge.gq/">genius-lyrics</a> work. But adding a Genius API key will unlock some cool features! You can see a more complete code <a href="https://github.com/LucasLeRay/serverless-vercel">here</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Deployment 🍾</h2>
<p>The most interesting part, and yet the easiest one.  </p>
<p>To deploy on Vercel, install <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/cli">Vercel CLI</a> first:</p>
<pre><code>yarn global vercel
</code></pre>
<p>Then, deploy with the following command in the root of your project:</p>
<pre><code>vercel --prod
</code></pre>
<p>If it’s the first time you use the CLI, you’ll need to login to Vercel.<br>
You’ll be then prompted to add some infos to your project (default options are fine).</p>
<p>Here's the response you should have:</p>
<pre><code>Vercel CLI 20.1.1
🔍  Inspect: DETAILS-URL [3s]
✅  Production: https://YOUR-PRODUCTION-URL [copied to clipboard] [14s]
</code></pre>
<p>And voilà !<br>
Go to <code>https://YOUR-PRODUCTION-URL/api</code> to see it live!<br>
You can take a look at my live version <a href="https://serverless-vercel-eta.vercel.app/api">here</a>.</p>
<pre><code>{
  "status": 200,
  "lyrics": "Oh, oh, oh, oh"
}
</code></pre>
<h6>So deep lyrics 👀</h6>
<p>Here are some advantages of our fresh new Serverless API:</p>
<ul>
<li>It only runs when called.</li>
<li>It’s free, forever. <a href="https://vercel.com/pricing">Vercel’s paid plans</a> are for team projects.</li>
<li>Vercel scales the allocated resources according to your needs. So you don't have to worry if your API will resist x100 usage.</li>
<li>Vercel offers a lot of configuration. For example, you can deploy your API from a GitHub repository. Take a look at your new dashboard on <a href="https://vercel.com/dashboard">Vercel</a>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Serverless Drawbacks 🤔</h2>
<p>As we saw, Serverless is awesome, but it’s not perfect, though. Here’s some common critics about it:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://dashbird.io/blog/can-we-solve-serverless-cold-starts/">Cold Start</a></strong>: Your API may be a bit slower than a regular server. It's because your Serverless function needs to warm up when it’s called, whereas your server is always up.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/what-is-serverless/9781491984178/ch04.html#idm140542862552224">Loss of Control</a></strong>: The <em>Cloud Provider</em> operates your API and not you. So, you depend on them for the reliability of your API.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.serverless.com/blog/serverless-monitoring-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly">Difficult Monitoring</a></strong>: In general, Serverless apps are harder to test and monitor. It can be a problem when you need to have critical insight about your functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The great thing is that Serverless community is working to make it even better! Weaknesses are becoming less common and Serverless can be used on a growing number of problems.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Conclusion 🎉</h2>
<p>For most of your backend needs, Serverless may be a great opportunity. Coupled with a <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">SSG (Static Site Generator)</a> such as <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.Js</a> you can build complete applications without server or financial costs.</p>
<p>The sky is the limit, and we only saw a very minimal use of what is possible to do with Serverless or Vercel.</p>

<p>This chapter is an attempt to illustrate what are the core principles of Data Oriented Programming as I understand them.
It is highly influenced by my programming experience in Clojure, but I believe that those principles are language agnostic.</p>
<p>One could adhere to them in an Object Oriented (OO) language like Java or C# and one could break them
in a Functional Programming (FP) language like Ocaml, Haskell, JavaScript (or even in Clojure).</p>
<p>In fact, in this chapter, I am going to illustrate how those principles could be applied or broken
in JavaScript, a programming language that supports both FP and OOP.</p>
<p>The principles of Data Oriented (DO) Programming are:</p>

<p>Each principle is explored in a separate article.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="text-org418e909">
<p>
Remember how I mention that we use shell in two distinct ways, interactively and programmatically.
I’ve shown my idea for the first, let’s chat about the second.
</p>

<p>
While I’ve been thinking about this for many years, not long ago, I came across a Reddit Question:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/piper-presentation-slides/piper-presentation-a.png" alt="Lisp people: What's your go-to language for when you want to write a quick script.  Python seems to be the default for me, but I do genuinely find Lisp joyful to write in." width="1000">

</figure>

<p>
To which I responded that as a Lisp, Emacs Lisp is great as integrating any good idea that comes along, and stealing good ideas has made this system from the twentieth century still useful and almost modern.
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/piper-presentation-slides/piper-presentation-b.png" alt="After many years of shell and Perl scripts that grew in complexity, I switch to writing scripts where it is easiest to call, Emacs Lisp.  With modern libraries and completing libraries like Helm and Ivy, I just found a nice go to language." width="1000">

</figure>


<figure id="orgd91c85c">
<img src="http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/piper-presentation-slides/slide-12.png" alt="I skipped showing a couple of slides that I just described.  This slide is titled, Emacs as a Go To Scripting Language" width="1000">

</figure>

<p>
The old adage that Emacs is an operating system is pretty true, it is just an operating system of functions, and as such, it really good for the hacker.  You want to either overwrite or just advice every function.  Global variables, normally a bad thing when you are sharing code with others, turns out to be really easy to prototype ideas when it is just you.
</p>

<p>
But think about all the really great libraries and support that we have that are new.  I didn’t have these in the 1980s:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Common Lisp library</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/magnars/dash.el">Dash library</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/magnars/s.el">S library</a> for strings</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rejeep/f.el">F Library</a> for files</li>
<li>Web-focused Libraries for JSON, Yaml, XML</li>
</ul>

<p>
But I think the most compelling argument for using Emacs functions instead of shell scripts is the improved user interface.  I’m serious.  Think about all those command line options to each command you use, and how no amount of tab completion helps.  In emacs, we can easily bind functions to keys, use two great completing systems (<a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper">Ivy</a> or <a href="https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm">Helm</a>) that can give you history of the arguments, just not the command.
</p>

<p>
Finally, think of using Hydra and Magit’s interface, <a href="https://github.com/magit/transient">Transient</a>, to really have a flexible approach to running commands.
</p>


<figure id="org5b922cc">
<img src="http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/piper-presentation-slides/slide-13.png" alt="Shell scripts are both good and bad" width="1000">

</figure>

<p>
Shell scripts, especially small ones can be really readable, and they are good as running commands and connecting them with streams, however, any script that grows to any size seems to become completely unreadable.  The other issue is that since everything is a string, we can have conversion issues into numbers or needing to escape white space.  Sure, modern versions of the shell have arrays, but they’re pretty kludgy at best.
</p>

<p>
So, can we take the best of both Lisp and Shell scripts?
If we could, this could be a win for us using Emacs, as calling a <i>function</i> is better than a <i>script</i>.
</p>


<figure id="org55b36c0">
<img src="http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/piper-presentation-slides/slide-14.png" alt="Maybe we could bring the good parts of shell scripts into Emacs." width="1000">

</figure>

<p>
What should we <i>bring over</i> from shells?  The <code>format</code> function is fairly good, but the shell, along with most modern languages, have variable substitution within strings.  This seems more readable.  Also, since the shell has embedded itself in my DNA, I am comfortable with <code>mkdir</code> and <code>cp</code>.  Besides, since Emacs doesn’t have namespaces, our functions tend to be pretty lengthy, which often makes our code is little more difficult to read.
</p>

<p>
But when we do, we can get a slew of Lispy goodness, like data structures, better iterations, logical variable scoping, and more functions than you can shake a stick.
</p>


<figure id="org08050f7">
<img src="http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/piper-presentation-slides/slide-15.png" alt="Desired Features" width="1000">

</figure>

<p>
The magic starts with a couple of macros that will convert the <i>forms within</i> to be more script-like.  I have five specific goals for how this macro should behave.  Let me explain each of these in details.
</p>


<figure id="orgfb3be37">
<img src="http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/piper-presentation-slides/slide-16.png" alt="Shell Executables should just Work" width="1000">

</figure>

<p>
Should be easy to call a shell command, using the <code>shell</code> form:
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>(</span><span>piper-script</span>
 <span>(</span>shell <span>"ls /tmp"</span><span>))</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This should also work well with files that have spaces:
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>(</span><span>piper-script</span>
 <span>(</span>shell <span>"ls"</span> <span>"~/Google Drive File Stream/My Drive/"</span><span>))</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Give the <code>shell</code> form function multiple strings, and it will assume that all strings are parameters, and not do any parsing, but this function will split single strings on spaces.
</p>

<p>
How about making an alias for the <code>shell</code> function name?
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>(</span><span>piper-script</span>
 <span>(</span>$ <span>"ls /tmp"</span><span>))</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Looks like a prompt character.
</p>


<figure id="orgef93771">
<img src="http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/piper-presentation-slides/slide-17.png" alt="Pipes and Data Transformations" width="1000">

</figure>

<p>
I use the same technique described earlier of using a temporary buffer, and running shell commands such that the contents of the buffer become <i>standard in</i> to a shell command, and the results of the command replace the contents of the buffer for the next command.  This allows an obvious pipe-like approach:
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>(</span><span>piper-script</span>
 <span>(</span>$ <span>"ls"</span> <span>"-1"</span> <span>"/tmp"</span><span>)</span>
 <span>(</span>| <span>"grep Temp"</span><span>)</span>
 <span>(</span>| <span>"tr [a-z] [A-Z]"</span><span>))</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Keep in mind you can use any Emacs function that works with buffers.
</p>



<figure id="org1476641">
<img src="http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/piper-presentation-slides/slide-18.png" alt="Wildcard Expansion" width="1000">

</figure>

<p>
File expansion should work as expected:
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>(</span><span>piper-script</span>
 <span>(</span>$ <span>"ls"</span> <span>"~/.emacs.d/*.el"</span><span>))</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Keep in mind that the <code>piper-script</code> looks at <i>every string</i>, so to make this work, if an expansion fails to find matching files, I just return the original string.
</p>


<figure id="org0331f2e">
<img src="http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/piper-presentation-slides/slide-19.png" alt="Embedded Strings" width="1000">

</figure>

<p>
While <code>format</code> is fine, <i>string-variable substitution</i> is more readable, plus I want to be able to insert both Emacs variables as well as environment variables:
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>((</span>some-var <span>"fooey"</span><span>))</span>
  <span>(</span><span>piper-script</span>
   <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>((</span>nudder-var <span>"chop"</span><span>))</span>
     <span>(</span>echo <span>"$HOME/projects/${nudder-var}/${some-var}"</span><span>))))</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Should return:
</p>
<pre>"/home/howard/projects/chop/fooey"
</pre>


<figure id="orga006232">
<img src="http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/piper-presentation-slides/slide-20.png" alt="Shell-Like Commands?" width="1000">

</figure>

<p>
I’m not convinced, but perhaps when converted shell script should have shorter, more shell-like function names.  In others words, I could use the function <code>grep</code> instead of <code>keep-lines</code>.  In this case, if <code>grep</code> were in quotes and passed to the <code>shell</code> function it would call out to the executable, and if not, to the Emacs function, so maybe this would be more confusing.
</p>

<p>
However, I do need to write <i>some functions</i>, like <code>sudo</code> is a <code>let</code> wrapper around a modification to convert the <code>default-directory</code> variable to reference Tramp.
</p>


<p>
Let me run through a couple of examples, and for each, I want to show my original shell script, and how I converted it.
</p>


<figure id="org4d28751">
<img src="http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/piper-presentation-slides/slide-21.png" alt="First Example" width="1000">

</figure>

<p>
First, let’s see if I can get the resident memory size of two running browsers.
</p>



<figure id="org28b9eda">
<img src="http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/piper-presentation-slides/slide-22.png" alt="First example's Original Script" width="1000">

</figure>

<p>
While the <code>ps</code> has a lot of command line options, I’m going to use grep to look for the top-level process, that is, the ones where the parent process is <code>1</code>, and I want to ignore all the extra service frameworks that Chrome starts:
</p>

<div>
<pre>ps -u $<span>USER</span> -o ppid,rss,command | egrep <span>'Chrome|Firefox'</span> | grep <span>'^ *1'</span> | grep -v Frameworks
</pre>
</div>



<figure id="orgea00a67">
<img src="http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/piper-presentation-slides/slide-23.png" alt="New Piper Script for First example" width="1000">

</figure>

<p>
The most prominent advantage is the use of Emacs’ <code>rx</code> macro for the regular expression (which I pass to the <code>keep-lines</code> alias):
</p>

<div>

<p>
I’ve installed Ubuntu on an old Macbook laptop, and I noticed that after closing the lid, the computer would repeated turn itself on and off.  The reason is that some devices are set to wake up the system, and magic process entry can be used to both read the state of all these devices, but if you write the name of the device back to this process entry, it will turn it off.
</p>

<p>
Why yes, this does seem like a job for a script, eh?
</p>

</figure>

<p>
My original script uses <code>cat</code> to expose all the entries, which text I can massage with a little pipe sequence.
Eventually storing each enabled device in a variable, and writing the value of that variable back into the process entry.

</figure>

<p>
The <code>piper-script</code> version starts by looking a lot like the original, but I use a Lisp-looking looping macro I call <code>for</code> and a function that converts all the lines in this temporary buffer into a list of strings for it to consume:
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>(</span><span>piper-script</span>
 <span>(</span>sudo
  <span>(</span>cat <span>"/proc/acpi/wakeup"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span>grep <span>"enabled"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span>replace-regexp <span>" .*"</span> <span>""</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span>for <span>(</span>device <span>(</span>read-all-lines<span>))</span>
    <span>(</span>write-into device <span>"/proc/acpi/wakeup"</span><span>))))</span>
</pre>
</div>



<figure id="org7fd16be">
<img src="http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/piper-presentation-slides/slide-27.png" alt="Show us the Magic" width="1000">

</figure>

<p>
The magic is obviously a nifty macro.  I simply use a function from the dash library to analyze and possibly change every element I find in the forms given to it, without changing the structure of those forms:
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>(</span><span>defmacro</span> <span>piper-script</span> <span>(</span><span>&amp;rest</span> forms<span>)</span>
  <span>"Runs the FORMS in a shell-like DSL."</span>
  <span>(</span>cons 'with-temp-buffer
        <span>(</span>-tree-map #'piper--script-transform forms<span>)))</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Since all command works with a buffer, we create one, run through the converted forms, and not shown here, but we return the contents of the buffer as a string.
</p>



<figure id="org55639ce">
<img src="http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/piper-presentation-slides/slide-28.png" alt="Piper Script Transform" width="1000">

</figure>

<p>
The followup magic happens with a function that returns a potentially changed version of the form.  It is just a lengthy <code>cond</code> statement, but you can see that at first, I change strings, so that I can expand any wildcards or variable substitution.  Then I just swap out various function names for their alias.  The way it is currently written, I can’t use any variables with matching names as I don’t currently distinguish their position.  Did I mention that this was a proof of concept?

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) is all the rage nowadays. It doesn’t matter if you want to play <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/dqn/">Atari 2600 games</a>, to master <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/">go</a> (<a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/alphago-zero-learning-scratch/">twice</a>) or even <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01815">chess</a>, you should probably use RL. Almost two years ago <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/">Andrej Karpathy</a> wrote an excellent post <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/">“Pong from Pixels”</a>. He did a wonderful job at explaining the RL problem and a specific RL algorithm (Policy Gradient) by the example of learning to play Pong. Here we extend his work, and compare multiple approaches to learn Pong. In contrast to the work of Kaparthy or DeepMind, we do not solve Pong “from pixels”, but from the actual internal state of the game. It’s easier, and allows us to focus on the RL part of the problem rather than the image processing part.</p>

<p>We rely on deep learning as a building block within classical RL algorithms. Solving Pong is not a very challenging task. The focus of this project is on understanding the merits and pitfalls of RL algorithms when combined with deep learning.</p>

<p>The structure of this website is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In the <a href="https://jonathanfiat.github.io/ApproxiPong/introduction">Introduction</a> we give a very short introduction to RL, to make sure we’re all on the same page, and expand on what are we trying to do here.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the simplest approach to solve RL problems is by imitating an expert. In <a href="https://jonathanfiat.github.io/ApproxiPong/chapter1">Chapter 1</a> we describe this approach and underscore its limitations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <a href="https://jonathanfiat.github.io/ApproxiPong/chapter2">Chapter 2: When You Know the Model</a> we present the most common mathematical formulation of the problem (MDP), and some classic solutions. We also show how they actually work when applied to Pong.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <a href="https://jonathanfiat.github.io/ApproxiPong/chapter3">Chapter 3: AlphaZero</a> we present DeepMind’s breakthrough algorithm AlphaGo Zero, and our own implementation, AlphaPong Zero.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <a href="https://jonathanfiat.github.io/ApproxiPong/chapter4">Chapter 4: Learning While Playing Part 1</a> we move on to learn how to play Pong without knowing the rules in advance, and present the Policy Gradient algorithm. We also give a variant of this algorithm with improved peformance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <a href="https://jonathanfiat.github.io/ApproxiPong/chapter5">Chapter 5: Learning While Playing Part 2</a> we present DeepMind’s Deep-Q-Learning algorithm, and some previously published variants and some of our own making.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <a href="https://jonathanfiat.github.io/ApproxiPong/chapter6">Chapter 6: Learning While Playing Part 3</a> we present Actor-Critic methods: methods that attempt to combine the other algorithms we described. This combination does indeed obtain the best results in our experiments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, there are some <a href="https://jonathanfiat.github.io/ApproxiPong/references">References</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Should you read this article? If you’re interested in RL, but can’t find your feet in all the mess of concepts and algorithms, you should certainly read this. If you’re an RL expert, you probably already know most of it, but you might find some of the empirical results interesting. If you’re not at all interested in RL, then you should most certainly not read this article. Here, play some Pong instead:</p>

<p>Anyway, we hope you’ll enjoy reading through. And if you don’t know yet where to begin, simply start at the <a href="https://jonathanfiat.github.io/ApproxiPong/introduction">Introduction</a>.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>A <strong>Turing machine</strong> (TM) can be defined formally as the collection of the following objects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a finite, non-empty set 𝑸 of <em>active states</em>;</li>
  <li>a distinguished state 𝒒<sub>0</sub> ∈ 𝑸, the <em>initial state</em>;</li>
  <li>an object 𝒒<sub>H</sub> ∉ 𝑸, the <em>halt state</em>;</li>
  <li>a finite set with quantity &gt; 1 𝜞 of <em>symbols</em>;</li>
  <li>a distinguished symbol 𝜸<sub>0</sub> ∈ 𝜞, the <em>blank symbol</em>;</li>
  <li>a 2-element set 𝑫, the <em>shifts</em>; and</li>
  <li>a <strong>total</strong> function 𝜹 : 𝑸 × 𝜞 → 𝜞 × 𝑫 × 𝑸 ∪ { 𝒒<sub>H</sub> }, the <em>transition function</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>A few remarks about this definition:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Some presentations of TMs allow the transition function to be <strong>partial</strong>, but this difference is inessential; a partial function can be made total by adding a catch-all default case.</li>
  <li>Although the halt state is stipulated to be distinct from the “active states”, it is occasionally convenient to group together the <strong>set of all states</strong>, 𝑸 ∪ { 𝒒<sub>H</sub> } (for instance, in the range of the transition function). The expression “active states” is used in cases where the halt state is not under consideration</li>
  <li>An element of 𝑸 ∪ { 𝒒<sub>H</sub> } × 𝜞 × 𝑫 is known as an <strong><em>action</em></strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Alternative “architectures”</strong> can be obtained by modifying this definition. The architecture described here is the <em>quintuple variation</em>, so called because its transition function can be represented as a set of 5-tuples. Another common architecture is the <em>quadruple variation</em>, with the transition function of the form 𝑸 × 𝜞 → 𝑸 ∪ { 𝒒<sub>H</sub> } × 𝜞 ∪ 𝑫. Whereas the quintuple variation prints and moves at each step, the quadruple variation does one or the other but not both. (In other words, the transition function prescribes different kinds of actions.)</li>
  <li>TMs are typically <strong>grouped by number of active states and symbols</strong>. An <em>n-state, m-symbol</em> TM has <em>n</em> active states and <em>m</em> symbols.</li>
  <li>It has become customary to represent states with capital Roman letters starting with <code>A</code>, with the halt state as <code>H</code> (or something else if it’s needed for the active states), <em>m</em> symbols with the numbers <em>0 … m-1</em> (with <em>0</em> as the blank symbol), and the shifts with <code>L</code> and <code>R</code> (or something else, if these letter are needed for the active states). In the old days, numbers were used for states, symbols, and shifts, and TM programs were much, much harder to read.</li>
</ol>

<p>Individual TMs are typically <strong>identified</strong> with their transition functions, or with <strong>representations thereof</strong>. These represenations may also be referred to simply as <strong><em>programs</em></strong><sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. Transition functions are often represented as tables, with actions indexed by state and symbol:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>&nbsp;</th>
      <th>A</th>
      <th>B</th>
      <th>C</th>
      <th>D</th>
      <th>E</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1RB</td>
      <td>1RC</td>
      <td>1RD</td>
      <td>1LA</td>
      <td>1RH</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1LC</td>
      <td>1RB</td>
      <td>0LE</td>
      <td>1LD</td>
      <td>0LA</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>What this says is: if the machine is in state <code>A</code> and scanning a <code>0</code> on the tape, it will print <code>1</code>, shift to the right, and transition to state <code>B</code>, and so on. Less transparently but more compactly, TMs can also be represented as <strong>simple strings</strong>. The actions are laid out, delimited by spaces, in such a way that actions from earlier states go earlier than later ones, and actions from the same state are ordered by the symbol they come from. Thus the table above comes out as <code>1RB 1LC 1RC 1RB 1RD 0LE 1LA 1LD 1RH 0LA</code>.</p>

<p>Table notation is easier to read than string notation, but since it’s not possible in general to tell what a TM does just by looking at it, this is of little benefit. On the other hand, string notation is excellent for <strong>ease of communication</strong>; a string TM description can easily be dropped into an email or a blog comment. String notation is also amenable to the use of <strong>standard text manipulation tools</strong>. For instance, a file of line-separated TMs in string form can be editted with <code>sed</code> and searched with <code>grep</code>.</p>

<p>Given two distinct TM strings, it might be asked if they represent <strong>meaningfully different</strong> programs or if they are only <strong>superficially different</strong>. This question can be answered by defining a canonical representation. A TM string is in <strong><em>lexical normal form</em></strong> iff the following conditions obtain:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The first shift is <code>R</code>.</li>
  <li>The non-initial active states (𝑸 ∖ 𝒒<sub>0</sub>) first occur in ascending order.</li>
  <li>The non-blank symbols (𝜞 ∖ 𝜸<sub>0</sub>) first occur in ascending order.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first condition rules out the possibility of two TMs being identical except for <strong>“mirror images”</strong> of each other. The second and third conditions rule out TMs that are the same except for <strong>permutations of states and symbols</strong>. Note that the second condition is trivially true for 1- and 2-state TMs, and the third condition is trivially true for 2-symbol TMs.</p>

<p>It’s <strong>easy</strong> determine whether or not a given TM is in normal form, and reasonably short TMs can be judged as normal or not by <strong>eyeball</strong>. It’s also straightforward, though a little more difficult, to <strong>generate</strong> the corresponding normal form for an arbitrary non-normal TM (doing so requires permuting graphs, which can be tricky).</p>

<p>There is another “normal form” that has been in use since the 60s. A TM string is in <strong><em>tree normal form</em></strong> iff the following conditions obtain:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The first shift is <code>R</code>.</li>
  <li>When run on a blank tape, the TM enters its non-initial active states in order.</li>
  <li>When run on a blank tape, the TM prints its non-blank symbols in order.</li>
</ol>

<p>Tree normal form is so-named because it is what results from the <strong>tree generation procedure</strong>. In that procedure, a partially-specified TM is partially run and its transition function “holes” are filled in as needed in a “tree” fashion. New states and symbols are added in order, yielding some kind of canonical form.</p>

<p>Notice that the definition of lexical normal form considers only to the TM string itself, and therefore belongs to <strong>static analysis</strong>. In contrast, the definition of tree normal form makes reference to the actual <strong>runtime behavior</strong> of the program represented by the TM string. Unfortunately, this means that it is <strong>not generally decideable</strong> whether a particular TM string is in tree normal form or not, or whether two distinct TM strings have the same tree normal form or not. Without impugning the tree generation procedure, which has been successfully used by researchers for decades, it’s safe to say that “tree normal form” is a <strong>misnomer</strong>.</p>

<p>For the reasons above, I propose that <strong>lexical normal form should be considered the canonical representation of TMs, and TM should be communicated and published in lexical normal form</strong>.</p>



<ol>
  <li>Which of the following are in lexical normal form? Which are in tree normal form?
    <ul>
      <li><code>1LB 0RB 1RA 0LC 1RC 1RA</code></li>
      <li><code>1RB 0LB 1LA 0RC 1LC 1LA</code></li>
      <li><code>1LC 0RC 1RB 1RA 1RA 0LB</code></li>
      <li><code>1RC 0LC 1LB 1LA 1LA 0RB</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Can a program be in both lexical and tree normal forms at once? If so, give an example. If not, why not?</li>
  <li>Write a program to determine whether or not an arbitrary TM string is in lexical / tree normal form.</li>
  <li>Write a program to convert an arbitrary TM string to lexical / tree normal form.</li>
  <li>There are <em>(2m(n+1))<sup>mn</sup></em> <em>n</em>-state <em>m</em>-symbol TMs. How many are there in lexical normal form? How many are there in tree normal form?</li>
</ol>

<p>The following questions have to do with Pascal Michel’s <strong><a href="http://www.logique.jussieu.fr/~michel/ha.html">historical survey of Busy Beaver candidate machines</a></strong>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Determine <em>by eyeball</em> which programs in the list are in lexical or tree normal forms.</li>
  <li>Use your program from exercise 2 above to determine which programs in the list are in lexical or tree normal form.</li>
  <li>(Extra credit) Go through the list and convert every program to lexical normal form, then email Pascal Michel and politely ask him to update the list to be lexical-normal.</li>
</ol>



<p><sup><a id="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> In some philosophical quarters a sharp distinction is drawn between <strong>“use” and “mention”</strong>. However, it’s both practical and instructive to let one’s eyes go out of focus when looking at the difference between a “Turing machine” and its “representation”. See <strong><a href="https://nickdrozd.github.io/2020/09/14/programmable-turing-machine.html">“Are Turing Machines Programmable?”</a></strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re trying to get into game development as a Software Engineer, finding
learning materials with the right level of context can be challenging. You’ll
likely face a choice between following materials introducing you to basic C# and
OOP concepts while also describing Unity concepts, or starting with advanced
tutorials and be left to figure out the core concepts deductively.</p><p>To fill that gap, I’m writing a series called
<strong><a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/tag/unity-for-software-engineers">Unity for Software Engineers</a></strong>. This is
the first piece, and I’ll be releasing additional installments over the next few
weeks, so <a href="http://eepurl.com/gVgusL">make sure to subscribe</a> for updates. The
series is intended for folks already comfortable with programming and software
architecture, especially those who learn best as I do: starting with first
principles and working your way upwards.</p><hr><p>I started my programming journey around 17 years ago by picking up
<a href="https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker">Game Maker</a>. Countless hours spent coding
little games and tools led me to a bigger passion for programming. Eventually, I
was at a point where I focused mainly on Software Engineering. From my peers, I
know this is quite a common path that many of us took to find programming.</p><p>Yet the game development scene has changed significantly from those days. When I
went to pick up Unity after a long absence from game development, I was mostly
interested in understanding the basic concepts: what are the fundamental
building blocks of a game? What do I need to know about how these building
blocks are represented in memory or on disk? How is idiomatic code organized?
What patterns are preferred?</p><p>In the first article in the series, we’ll focus on those first two questions.</p><h2 id="scene">Scenes</h2><p>A <strong>Scene</strong> is the largest unit of organizing your objects in-memory. Scenes
contain the objects making up your game.</p><p>In basic use, one scene represents a <strong>single level</strong> in your game, where one
scene is loaded at any given point. In more “advanced” use, you can have two or
more active scenes at a time. Scenes can be loaded additively and unloaded <sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>.
Having multiple scenes loaded during gameplay comes especially handy when
building a massive world; keeping far-away areas on-disk rather than in-memory
will help you stay within your performance budget.</p><div><figure><p><span>

decide it organizationally makes sense to put all your “environment” (e.g.,
individual pieces that make up a city or village) objects under an empty parent
object. This way, it can be collapsed in the scene view and easily moved
together when building your game.</p><figure><p><span>

avatar, and various UI elements rendered around the player.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Game Object nesting can also have <em>functional significance</em>. For example, a
“Car” can be an object, with code that controls the car’s speed and rotation as
a whole. But individual child objects might represent the four wheels (these
would spin independently), the car body, windows, etc. Moving the parent car
object would move all the child objects, keeping their relative orientation to
the parent (and each other). We might want the player to interact with a door
separately from the rest of the car, for instance.</p><h2 id="component">Components (&amp; MonoBehaviors)</h2><figure><p><span>

    </span></p><figcaption><p>The Warrior object from the previous screenshot is shown above in Unity’s
“Inspector” window. Each illustrated section (e.g., Animator, Rigidbody,
Collider) are <em>Components</em> making up this object.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Every Game Object is comprised of <strong>Components</strong>.</p><p>A Component implements a well-defined set of behaviors for a GameObject to
execute. Everything that makes an object what it is would come from the
components that make it up:</p><ul><li>A single “visible” piece of a car will have a <em>Renderer</em> component that
paints it, and likely a <em>Collider</em> component that sets up its collision
bounds.</li><li>If a car represents the player, the car object itself might have a <em>Player
Input Controller</em> that takes key input events and translates these to code
moving the car around.</li></ul><p>While you can write large and complex Components that correspond 1:1 to an
object (e.g., a player component codes the entire player, while an enemy
component codes the enemy as a whole), it’s typically common to factor out your
logic into streamlined pieces corresponding to individual <em>traits</em>. For example:</p><ul><li>All objects with <em>health</em>, whether a Player or an Enemy, might have a
<code>LivingObject</code> component that sets an initial health value, takes damage,
and triggers a death event once it dies.</li><li>A player might additionally have an input component controlling its
movement, while the enemy might have an AI component that controls its
movement instead.</li></ul><p>Components receive various callbacks throughout their lifetime, known in Unity
as <em>Messages</em>. Examples of Messages include <code>OnEnable</code>/<code>OnDisable</code>, <code>Start</code>,
<code>OnDestroy</code>, <code>Update</code>, and others. If an object implements an <code>Update()</code> method,
this method will automagically be called by Unity in every frame of the game
loop while the object is active, and the given component is enabled. These
methods can be marked <code>private</code>; the Unity engine will still call them.</p><p>Components can also expose public methods as you’d expect. Other components can
take a reference to a component and call these public methods.</p><h2 id="asset">Assets</h2><p><strong>Assets</strong> are the on-disk resources that make up your game project. These
include meshes (models), textures, sprites, sounds, and other resources.</p><p>When serialized to the disk, your scenes are represented as assets made up of
the Game Objects inside of them. We’ll also discuss in the next section how you
can make Game Objects that are reused often into an asset known as a

<em>instances</em> in a scene. But what if a particular class of objects is commonly
repeated? Such objects can be made into a <strong>Prefab</strong>, which is effectively the
object in asset form.</p><p>Instances of a prefab in a scene can have local modifications that distinguish
it (e.g., if a <em>tree</em> object is a prefab, you can have tree instances of
different heights). Instances of a prefab all inherit and override data from
their prefab.</p><h3>Nested Prefabs</h3><p>Starting with Unity 2018.3, Prefabs can be nested just as you expect:</p><ol><li>A parent object with prefab child objects can be a prefab itself. In the
parent prefab, the child prefab instance can have its own modifications. In
the scene, the entire prefab hierarchy is instantiated, and scene-specific
modifications can layer on top.</li><li>A prefab instance in a scene with its own local modifications can be saved as
its own “Prefab Variant” asset. A variant is a prefab asset that inherits
from another prefab, applying additional modifications on top.</li></ol><p>These concepts compose; a prefab variant of a nested prefab, or a prefab variant
of a prefab variant, for instance.</p><h2 id="serialization">Serialization &amp; Deserialization</h2><p>Your project’s assets, scenes, and objects are all persisted on-disk. When
editing your game, these objects are loaded in memory and saved back to disk
using
<a href="https://blogs.unity3d.com/2014/06/24/serialization-in-unity/">Unity’s serialization system</a>.
When playtesting your game, the objects and scenes in-memory are loaded through
the same serialization system. This system also maps between assets in your
compiled bundle and the loaded/unloaded scene objects in-memory.</p><p>The Unity Engine’s Serialization/Deserialization flow loads on-disk assets into
memory (in your project: for editing/playtesting; in-game, when loading a scene)
and is responsible for saving the state of your edited objects &amp; components back
into their scenes and prefabs.</p><p>Therefore, the serialization system is also at the core of the Unity Editor
experience itself. For a <code>MonoBehavior</code> to take an input on construction when
instantiated in a scene, those fields must be <em>serialized</em>.</p><p>Most core Unity types such as <code>GameObject</code>s, <code>MonoBehavior</code>s, and asset
resources are
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.serializableattribute">Serializable</a>
and can receive initial values on creation from within the Unity Editor. Public
fields on your <code>MonoBehavior</code> are serialized by default (if they’re of a
serializable type), and private fields need to be marked with Unity’s
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/SerializeField.html"><code>[SerializeField]</code></a>
attribute to be serialized as well.</p><figure><p><span>

<p>According to <a href="https://thelogic.co/news/exclusive/apple-sues-ontario-electronics-recycling-firm-claiming-it-stole-nearly-100000-products-for-resale/"><em>The Logic</em></a>, an Ontario electronics recycling firm is being sued by Apple, alleging the company stole and resold iOS and watchOS devices instead of destroying them.</p>	
	
	
	
<p>GEEP Canada is being accused of reselling 100,000 iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches, according to Apple’s lawsuit.</p>
<p>Apple says Barrie-based GEEP and members of its senior management team were aware of its activity. GEEP denies all wrongdoing and says when it discovered the reselling ring, it shut it down immediately.</p>
<p>As for damages, Apple is seeking $31 million from GEEP, plus proceeds made from selling iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches.</p>
<p>GEEP was hired by Apple back in the fall of November 2014 to assist in recycling old products instead of being discarded into landfills.</p>
<p>Apple says it sent 531,966 iPhones, 25,673 iPads and 19,277 Apple Watches to GEEP to be recycled from the start of 2015 to the end of 2017, according to lawsuit, seen by <em>The Logic</em>.</p>
<p>“At least 11,766 pounds of Apple devices left GEEP’s premises without being destroyed – a fact that GEEP itself confirmed. These misappropriated devices were then subsequently sold at a significantly higher price than other recycled materials to downstream vendors who refurbished and resold the devices to consumers,” explains Apple’s suit, filed in January.</p>
<p>Apple discovered GEEP was moving devices into areas not under camera surveillance after auditing the Ontario company’s warehouse. The iPhone maker found 18% of devices shipped to GEEP were active on wireless carrier networks.</p>
<p>While some devices like Wi-Fi iPads won’t show up on carrier networks, which Apple says makes the total number of stolen products higher.</p>
<p>GEEP says the reselling ring was due to three “rogue” employees, Roger Micks, Edward Cooper and Steven White, who sold the devices to Fu Yuan Yang at Whitby Recycling. Yang then sold these Apple devices to people in China.</p>
<p>GEEP’s third-party claim from July says it wants these employees, Yang and Whitby Recycling to pay damages if Apple wins, plus cover its legal fees.</p>
<p>The Ontario recycler says it has suffered “extensive business losses” due to the incident and its reputation, to go with Apple cancelling its contract.</p>

	<div>
		
<p>I recently decided to get a wireless speaker for our Kitchen. Sonos seems like an obvious choice these days. The sound quality and aesthetics were very appealing. So I ordered a Sonos One SL speaker.</p>



<p>In terms of sound quality and looks, I was very pleased. I’m not an audiophile but the sound quality seemed superb and the speaker just looks fantastic. A very clean and unassuming look.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="1024" src="https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/IMG_6571-1-768x1024.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/IMG_6571-1-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/IMG_6571-1-225x300.jpg 225w, https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/IMG_6571-1.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px"><figcaption>what’s hiding underneath ?</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>As I later discovered, a dirty beast hides under the cool exterior.</strong></p>



<p>My concerns started to grow almost immediately as I was setting up the new speaker. I downloaded the app, and started the setup process, soon to realize that I need to register with my email just to set up the device on my network… And of course, I had to accept the terms and conditions …. hmmm… ok, I guess.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/IMG_92F6A34207E1-1-576x1024.jpeg" alt="" width="236" height="420" srcset="https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/IMG_92F6A34207E1-1-576x1024.jpeg 576w, https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/IMG_92F6A34207E1-1-169x300.jpeg 169w, https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/IMG_92F6A34207E1-1.jpeg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 236px) 100vw, 236px"></figure></div>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/IMG_31E9A893CD62-1.png" alt="" width="203" height="361" srcset="https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/IMG_31E9A893CD62-1.png 375w, https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/IMG_31E9A893CD62-1-169x300.png 169w" sizes="(max-width: 203px) 100vw, 203px"></figure></div>



<p>I was then asked to allow sharing my location as well, which raised another alarm bell. <strong>Why does my speaker need my location?</strong> I’m not 100% sure, but if I recall, I had to allow it to access my location, or else I couldn’t continue.</p>



<p>Once the device was finally set up, I went through the settings, to explore and see what else is there. I was rather disappointed to find that <strong>“Additional usage data” was turned on by default</strong>. I live in Europe, and I thought that the EU regulations should prevent this kind of behaviour. They should explicitly ask my permission to track my usage, especially if it isn’t necessary for the device to function.</p>



<p>I could opt-out of it luckily, but it didn’t feel right to me.</p>



<h2>What data is Sonos collecting, and why?</h2>



<p>Digging into the <a href="https://www.sonos.com/en/legal/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sonos privacy policy</a> made my hair stand… </p>



<div><div>
<h5>Functional Data:</h5>



<div><p>This data is absolutely necessary for your Sonos Product or Service, including Sonos Radio, to perform its basic functions in a secure way and <strong>you will not be able to opt out from this data collection, sharing, and/or processing</strong> if you want to continue to use your Sonos Products.</p><p><strong>We collect:</strong></p></div>



<p><strong>Registration data.</strong> This data includes your email address, location, language preference, Product serial number, IP address, and Sonos account login information (as described above).<br><strong>System data.</strong> This data includes things like Product type, controller device type, controller operating system, software version, content source (audio line in), signal input (e.g. whether your TV outputs a specific audio signal such as Dolby to your Sonos system), information about WiFi antennas, system settings (such as equalisation or stereo pair), Product orientation, names of the music service(s) you added/enabled on your Sonos product, the names you have given your Sonos Product in different rooms, whether your Product has been tuned using Sonos Trueplay technology, system performance metrics (e.g. the temperature of your Product or WiFi signal strength) and error information.</p>
</div></div>



<p>(emphasis not mine)</p>



<p>So this is <em>just</em> the data that you <strong><em>cannot</em></strong> opt-out of. The data <strong>absolutely necessary to perform basic functions.</strong>  And in case you wonder why they track this data, here’s what the privacy policy says</p>



<div><p><strong>Why we collect Functional Data:</strong> We collect this information to help ensure that your Products are working properly, to provide you with customer support, to honour your audio preferences, and to guide product improvement and customer support decisions. We also collect this information to guide product improvement and customer support decisions which is <strong>our legitimate interest</strong>.</p></div>



<p>emphasis mine… we’ll go back to what <em><strong>legitimate interest</strong></em><strong> </strong>actually means later on.</p>



<p>I’m not sure what basic functions for a speaker might be, that they require to share so much data with Sonos. And if this not enough, there’s also the (optional) Usage data that Sonos happily collects, by default, without asking for permission</p>



<div><div>
<div><div>
<h5>Additional Usage Data:</h5>



<p>In order to improve your experience with Sonos Products and to offer better, personalised Sonos Products and Services, including Sonos Radio, that meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we collect the following Additional Usage Data. The processing of this information is in our legitimate interest as further set out below (under Why). You can opt out of sharing this data by following the steps listed <a href="https://www.sonos.com/en/legal/privacy#data-opt-out" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p>



<p><strong>We collect:</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Performance Information.</strong> This includes things like the temperature of your Product, WiFi information like signal strength, how often you use music services you have connected to your Sonos system (including, for some services, your login username, but not password), information about how often you use the Sonos app versus other control mechanisms, flow of interactions within the Sonos app, how often you use the physical controls on the unit, the flow of interactions within the Sonos app, duration of Sonos Product use, and, as required for certain Services, location-based data using GPS (or similar technology, where available) and crowdsourced WiFi access points and cell tower locations collected from your third party device when the Sonos app is in use.</li><li><strong>Activity Information.</strong> This includes duration of music service use, Product or room grouping information, command information (such as play, pause, change volume, or skip tracks), information about playlist or station container data including listening history (‘Recently Played’), and Sonos playlist or Sonos favourites information; each correlated to individual Sonos Products and your interactions with them. If you enable voice control or use Sonos Radio, we will additionally collect information about track data when using those features.</li></ul>



<blockquote><p><strong>Why:</strong> We collect this information so that we can help ensure Sonos Products are functioning properly, provide a personalised experience for our customers, determine what types of Product or feature improvements would please our customers most, and to help predict potential problems with Sonos Products. Additionally, to provide Sonos Radio, we collect location-based information for licensing and reporting purposes. <strong>Collecting this data is our legitimate interest</strong> to support a user-friendly experience that meets your needs and help you with issues you may experience. It is your choice if you want us to collect this information, and therefore you can opt out of sharing this data by following the steps listed <a href="https://www.sonos.com/en/legal/privacy#rights-choices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> personalisation services (e.g. Recently Played), Sonos Radio, Voice Control, and Direct Control functionality require Additional Usage Data to function. If you decide to use any of these features and/or Services, the <a href="https://www.sonos.com/en/legal/privacy#additional-data" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Additional Usage Data</a> becomes functional. You can always clear all Recently Played by following the instructions in the Sonos app.</p></blockquote>
</div></div>
</div></div>



<p>Again, the legitimate interest emphasis is mine…</p>



<p>If you read their privacy policy further, you could spot the real incentives and potential uses of the data, but I won’t dive into it here. I do recommend reading it though.</p>



<h2>(il)legitimate interest</h2>



<p>So what is this all about? Well, if you’re familiar with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you might guess the answer. I’m not a lawyer, so without going into too much detail, here’s my brief understanding of it.</p>



<p>First off, the GDPR is the regulation that aims to protect the privacy of all EU citizens. It’s meant to reduce privacy invasive practices, force companies to protect private data, and encourage companies to treat private data with care and respect.</p>



<p>But what’s “legitimate interest”, and why is it important?</p>



<p>Essentially, companies aren’t simply allowed to store any customer data they want. They need a “good reason” to do so. Or in other words, they need to have a legitimate interest in storing such data. Otherwise, they’re simply not allowed to store it at all.</p>



<p>So now, can I just ask someone who accesses my website “What’s your home address”? and store it, if they give it to me. I need to have a real reason to ask for this address. It can be my legitimate interest to ask it if, for example, I’m going to send you a free gift. I obviously can’t send you a gift without knowing your address.</p>



<p>As you can imagine, “legitimate interest” can be interpreted in many different ways. Is it legitimate interest to ask for an email address in order to send marketing emails? well, actually it might be. There’s no black and white answer here.</p>



<h2>Putting it to the test</h2>



<p>There are <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/legitimate-interests/what-is-the-legitimate-interests-basis/#balancing_test" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3 tests for “legitimate interest”</a>:</p>



<div><div>
<div><div>
<ul><li><strong>Purpose test</strong> – is there a legitimate interest behind the processing?</li><li><strong>Necessity test</strong> – is the processing necessary for that purpose?</li><li><strong>Balancing test</strong> – is the legitimate interest overridden by the individual’s interests, rights or freedoms?</li></ul>
</div></div>



<p>Whilst Sonos tries very hard to meet those first two tests with their policies (but in my opinion, have a very weak position there), I think it clearly fails the balancing test. Sonos blatantly violates its customer privacy by excessively tracking, analysing and making use of very detailed information about them. They capture their listening preferences, their location, neighbouring Wifi access points and lots more. And worse of all, they do it without asking for explicit consent. It’s all hidden in the privacy policy, and set to expose all this data by default.</p>



<p>What’s the <strong>purpose</strong> of collecting all this data? Sonos claims that their purpose is “[To] help ensure Sonos Products are functioning properly, provide a personalised experience for our customers, determine what types of Product or feature improvements would please our customers most, and to help predict potential problems with Sonos Products”. This seems fairly clear as a purpose. Still rather widespread and invasive, but there’s a purpose.</p>



<p>But is collecting all this data <strong>necessary</strong> to meet this purpose? I don’t think so. I think they collect far too detailed information, and they could meet the same purpose with far less data, or by using non-private / anonymised data. </p>



<p>For example: how does the IP address of the customer help with any of those stated purposes? Or why do they need to map neighbouring Wifi access …</p></div></div></div></article></div>

<![CDATA[Symbiotic Prototyping: Minimizing value risk in B2B settings]]>

<p>If we asked a room full of product managers what was keeping them up at night, the most common answer would be a version of “building product that doesn’t get used,” more concisely known as “Value Risk.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In <a href="https://svpg.com/four-big-risks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Four Big Risks</a>, Marty Cagan calls out the major risk categories products face:</p>



<blockquote><ol>
<li>value risk (whether customers will buy it or users will chose it)</li>
<li>usability risk (whether users can figure out how to use it)</li>
<li>feasibility risk (whether our engineers can build out what we need with the time, skills, and technology we have)</li>
<li>business viability risk (whether this solution also works for the various aspects of our business)</li></ol></blockquote>



<p>Of the four risks, “value risk” is the most fundamental: does this product effectively solve a meaningful pain point for users?&nbsp; Usability, feasibility, and business viability risks are only relevant if we’re confident in the product’s value.</p>

<p>With value risk looming largest, identifying strategies to quickly assess and mitigate value risk is one of the most important jobs of product teams.</p>



<h2>B2C Painted Door Tests</h2>



<p>B2C brands often use <a href="https://medium.com/@crstanier/a-product-managers-guide-to-painted-door-tests-a1a5de33b473" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Painted Door Tests</a> to evaluate interest in a new capability.&nbsp; Painted Door Tests are designed to measure a user’s appetite for a feature without requiring that the feature be built.</p>



<p>For example, let’s imagine that a social network is considering adding a feature that shows which of your friends are discussing a topic a user recently posted about.&nbsp; The social network might add a “See Who’s Talking About This” button and measure the number of clicks the button receives.&nbsp; By adding a placeholder version of the button, the team can begin to assess whether there’s enough interest or value (proxied by clicks) to consider building the new feature without actually having to build out the functionality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once a feature passes the initial Painted Door Test, there’s still more work to do in evaluating the feature’s impact. For example, we would probably want to measure whether sessions including the “See Who’s Talking About This” button lead to long-term engagement.&nbsp; Still, the Painted Door Test provides a quick read on user interest.</p>

<h2>Challenges of B2B Painted Door Tests</h2>



<p>For B2B companies, Painted Door Tests are tricky to execute for a couple of reasons:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Smaller user base:</strong> while it’s not uncommon for B2C products to have thousands or millions of active users, B2B brands typically have fewer users.&nbsp; The smaller user base can make it hard to see clear directional results from Painted Door Tests.</li><li><strong>Disruptive to users:</strong> users often depend on B2B software to do their jobs and might be annoyed if they click on an exciting new feature that turns out to be a mirage.</li><li><strong>Draws attention to functionality gaps in the product:</strong> Painted Door Tests in B2B products can draw attention to missing functionality in a product that a user might be paying a high price tag for.&nbsp; This can be especially problematic if the feature offered by a Painted Door Test is not ultimately integrated into the product.</li><li><strong>Greater complexity in measuring business critical outcomes:</strong> In a B2C setting, clicking on a Painted Door feature is a signal that a feature is desired, but it still might not translate into a business critical result, like increased time in an app.&nbsp; The gap between expressing interest and desired long-term behavior is often larger and more complex for B2B products.&nbsp; For example, desired B2B outcomes might include behaviors like setting up a tracking event on a website, increasing ad spend, or setting up a new data feed.&nbsp; Because many of these B2B outcomes are preceded by a series of events that occur within the four walls of the client (budgeting changes, internal approvals, etc), the link between a Painted Door Test and its desired result can be challenging to measure.</li></ul>



<p>With a little creativity, we can take the spirit of rapid validation from Painted Door Tests and apply it to a B2B setting.&nbsp; We’ll quickly create a prototype to get direct customer feedback and measure whether there’s interest in the feature and whether that interest translates to a business critical action.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Symbiotic Prototyping</h2>



<p>Since Painted Door Tests can draw attention to functionality gaps, potentially create friction for B2B users, and suffer from small sample sizes, any attempt to run these tests in a B2B context must mitigate these obstacles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enter <strong>symbiotic prototyping</strong>, a validation technique designed for insights-focused B2B products.</p>



<p>All good relationships need an element of symbiosis, and the relationship between product managers and users is no different.&nbsp; Symbiotic prototyping creates value for the user in the form of business insight and creates value for the product manager by enabling the direct observation of product usage in a complex B2B setting.</p>



<p>During symbiotic prototyping, we take a new product idea, and prototype that idea with client data, resulting in an insight about the client’s business.&nbsp; We share that insight with a user in the course of normal business communication and work with them as they take the insight and turn it into an action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During this process we’ll receive implicit and explicit feedback from the user.&nbsp; Since the feedback isn’t tied to an existing product feature, and instead is framed as a helpful insight shared in an email, responses are likely to be more candid and the product manager has the opportunity to change directions based on the feedback.</p>



<p>After working through the symbiotic prototyping process, we’ll have a read on whether the insights our potential product surfaces, provide value and drive impact for users.</p>



<p>Here are the steps to get a symbiotic prototype up and running:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Define the target outcome:</strong> what specific metric or action is the potential new product intended to drive?&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Prototype:</strong> the “prototype” is a few sentences sharing the key insight on the client’s business and maybe a graph or two for illustrative purposes.&nbsp; The idea is to move quickly and clearly communicate information to the user, not to think about interactions in the product or to perfect the design. The design will become critical only if the potential product passes the value test.</li><li><strong>Test:</strong> share the prototype with the user, keeping an ear to the ground for questions and feedback, and observe whether the user drives to the target outcome.</li><li><strong>Iterate:</strong> based on both explicit and implicit feedback from the customer, iterate on the prototype and share with a few more users.</li></ol>



<p>Let’s walk through a case study illustrating how we’d apply these four steps in a real world setting.</p>



<h3>The Scenario</h3>



<p>Let’s imagine that our product is an on-site analytics tool.&nbsp; We’re considering adding a feature that highlights the demographics of users contributing to the growth or decline of key actions on the website.&nbsp; We are prototyping the feature for a robo-advisor client.</p>



<h4>Target Outcome</h4>



<p>We’ve observed that the number of A/B tests set up on our on-site analytics platform is a strong indicator of client retention.&nbsp; The key outcome we’re optimizing for is whether the client sets up an A/B test based on the information we provide.</p>



<h4>Prototype</h4>



<p>Looking at the client’s account, we see that the “Increase Deposit” action on the website is an event that they are consistently analyzing and that the event was triggered 15% less frequently this week relative to last week.&nbsp; Furthermore, we notice that 75% of the decline resulted from users aged 25-35.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Test<em>&nbsp;</em></h4>

<h4>Iterate</h4>



<p>During the exchange with Carlos, it’s clear that we’ve hit on a meaningful customer pain point (he too is concerned that the “Increase Deposit” event is down) and our product hypothesis of highlighting which customer segments are responsible for the decline in events seems promising. However, Carlos alluded to a couple of potential product improvements:</p>



<ul><li>Highlighting whether the engagement decline from 25-35 year olds was due to fewer users in that age range coming to the website or whether they visited the website but were not engaging with the “Increase Deposit” action.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Identifying website changes that coincided with the decline in the key event.</li></ul>



<p>Based on Carlos’s feedback, we would reply with the data on session decline for the 25-35 age range and information on other changes that Carlos’ team had recently made to the website.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most importantly, we would partner closely with Carlos as he root causes and addresses the decline in the “Increase Deposit” event by observing and asking questions to inform our product direction.&nbsp; Here are a couple areas we should pay special attention to:</p>



<ul><li>Does Carlos launch the A/B test?&nbsp; Why or why not?&nbsp; How could we have accelerated Carlos’ ability to launch the test?</li><li>What information is Carlos hoping to understand after launching the A/B test?</li><li>How does Carlos share information on the decline of the “Increase Deposit” event with his colleagues at work?&nbsp; How might we make sharing that information easier?</li><li>What questions does Carlos ask us along the way?</li></ul>



<p>After walking through the symbiotic prototyping process with Carlos, we would take our new and improved prototype based on Carlos’s feedback and repeat this same exercise with a few more customers, integrating their feedback with each cycle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once we’ve reached a place where clients consistently launch A/B tests based on the insights we’ve provided, we would move into the product specification and design process.&nbsp; During this phase, we’d determine how to surface the key customer segments driving changes in event frequency within our product, and go through another validation process focused on product usability.</p>



<p>If we aren’t ultimately able to consistently drive towards the A/B outcome, that’s also a success.&nbsp; The ability to quickly toss out product ideas that don’t provide value to the user is the mark of a great product manager.</p>

<p>Taking a step back, there are several benefits to the symbiotic prototyping process:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
<p>Self Supervised Learning is an interesting research area where the goal is to learn rich representations from unlabeled data without any human annotation.</p>
<p>This can be achieved by creatively formulating a problem such that you use parts of the data itself as labels and try to predict that. Such formulations are called pretext tasks.</p>
<p>For example, you can setup a pretext task to predict the color version of the image given the grayscale version. Similarly, you could remove a part of the image and train a model to predict the part from the surrounding. There are many such <a href="https://amitness.com/2020/02/illustrated-self-supervised-learning/">pretext tasks</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/kt-pretext-tasks.png" alt=""></p>
<p>By pre-training on the pretext task, the hope is that the model will learn useful representations. Then, we can finetune the model to downstream tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation with only a small set of labeled training data.</p>
<h2 id="challenge-of-evaluating-representations">Challenge of evaluating representations</h2>
<p>So pretext tasks can help us learn representations. But, this poses a question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How to determine how good a learned representation is?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently, the standard way to gauge the representations is to evaluate it on a set of standard tasks and benchmark datasets.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Linear classification</strong>: ImageNet classification using frozen features</li>
<li><strong>Low Data Regime</strong>: ImageNet Classification using only 1% to 10% of data</li>
<li><strong>Transfer Learning</strong>: Object Classification, Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation on PASCAL VOC</li>
</ul>
<p>We can see that the above evaluation methods require us to use the same model architecture for both the pretext task and the target task.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/kt-pretext-target-challenge.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This poses some interesting challenges:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For the pretext task, our goal is to learn on a large-scale unlabeled dataset and thus deeper models(e.g. ResNet) would help us learn better representations.</p>
<p>But, for downstream tasks, we would prefer shallow models(e.g. AlexNet) for actual applications. Thus, we currently have to consider this limitation when designing the pretext task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s harder to fairly compare which pre-text task is better if some methods used simpler architecture while other methods used deeper architecture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can’t compare the representations learned from pretext tasks to handcrafted features such as HOG.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We may want to exploit several data domains such as sound, text, and videos in the pretext task but the target task may limit our design choices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Model trained on pretext task may learn extra knowledge that is not useful for generic visual recognition. Currently, the final task-specific layers are ignored and weights or features only up to certain convolutional layers are taken.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="knowledge-transfer">Knowledge Transfer</h2>
<p>Noroozi et al. proposed a simple idea to tackle these issues in their 2018 paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00385">“Boosting Self-Supervised Learning via Knowledge Transfer”</a>.</p>
<h3 id="intuition">Intuition</h3>
<p>The authors observed that in a good representation space, semantically similar data points should be close together.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/kt-good-vs-bad-representation.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In regular supervised classification, the information that images are semantically similar is encoded through labels annotated by humans. A model trained on such labels would have a representation space that groups semantically similar images.</p>
<p>Thus, with pre-text tasks in self-supervised learning, the objective is implicitly learning a metric that makes the same category images similar and different category images dissimilar. Hence we can provide a robust estimate of the learned representation if we could encode semantically related images to the same labels in some way.</p>
<h2 id="general-framework">General Framework</h2>
<p>The authors propose a novel framework to transfer knowledge from a deep self-supervised model to a separate shallow downstream model. You can use different model architectures for the pretext task and downstream task.</p>
<p><strong>Key Idea:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cluster features from pretext task and assign cluster centers as pseudo-labels for unlabeled images. Then, re-train a small network with target task architecture on pseudo-labels to predict pseudo-labels and learn a novel representation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The end-to-end process is described below:</p>
<h4 id="1-pretext-task">1. Pretext task</h4>
<p>Here we choose some deep network architecture and train it on some pretext task of our choice on some dataset. We can take features from some intermediate layer after the model is trained.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/kt-step-1.png" alt=""><br>
Figure: Training on Pre-text Task (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00385">Source</a>)</p>
<h4 id="2-k-means-clustering">2. K-means Clustering</h4>
<p>For all the unlabeled images in the dataset, we compute the feature vectors from the pretext task model. Then, we run K-means clustering to group semantically similar images. The idea is that the cluster centers will be aligned with categories in ImageNet.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/kt-step-2.png" alt=""><br>
Figure: Clustering Features (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00385">Source</a>)</p>
<p>In the paper, the authors ran K-means on a single Titan X GPU for 4 hours to cluster 1.3M images into 2000 categories.</p>
<h4 id="3-pseudo-labeling">3. Pseudo-labeling</h4>
<p>The cluster centers are treated as the pseudo-label. We can use either the same dataset as the above step or use a different dataset itself. Then, we compute the feature vectors for those images and find the closest cluster center for each image. This cluster center is used as the pseudo-label.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/kt-step-3.png" alt=""><br>
Figure: Generating Pseudo-labels (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00385">Source</a>)</p>
<h4 id="4-training-on-pseudo-labels">4. Training on Pseudo-labels</h4>
<p>We take the model architecture that will be used for downstream tasks and train it to classify the unlabeled images into the pseudo-labels. Thus, the target architecture will learn a new representation such that it will map images that were originally close in the pre-trained feature space to close points.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/kt-step-4.png" alt=""><br>
Figure: Re-training on pseudo-labels (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00385">Source</a>)</p>
<h2 id="advantage-of-knowledge-transfer">Advantage of Knowledge Transfer</h2>
<p>We saw how by clustering the features and then using pseudo-labels, we can bring the knowledge from any pretext task representations into a common reference model like AlexNet.</p>
<p>As such, we can now easily compare different pretext tasks even if they are trained using different architectures and on different data domains. This also allows us to improve self-supervised methods by using deep models and challenging pretext tasks.</p>
<h2 id="how-well-does-this-framework-work">How well does this framework work?</h2>
<p>To evaluate the idea quantitatively, the authors set up an experiment as described below:</p>
<h3 id="a-increase-complexity-of-pretext-task-jigsaw">a. Increase complexity of pretext task (Jigsaw++)</h3>
<p>To evaluate their method, the authors took an old puzzle-like pretext task called “Jigsaw” where we need to predict the permutation that was used to randomly shuffle a 3*3 square grid of image.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/kt-jigsaw-plus-plus.png" alt=""><br>
Image Modified from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00385">Paper</a></p>
<p>They extended the task by randomly replacing 0 to 2 number of tiles with tile from another random image at some random locations. This increases the difficulty as now we need to solve the problem using only the remaining patches. The new pretext task is called “Jigsaw++”.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/kt-jigsaw-plus-plus-goal.png" alt=""><br>
Image Modified from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00385">Paper</a></p>
<p>In the paper, they use 701 total permutations which had a minimum hamming distance of 3. They apply mean and standard deviation normalization at each image tile independently. They also make images gray-scale 70% of the time to prevent the network from cheating with low-level statistics.</p>
<h3 id="b-use-a-deeper-network-to-solve-pretext-task">b. Use a deeper network to solve pretext task</h3>
<p>The authors used VGG-16 to solve the pretext task and learn representations. As VGG-16 has increased capacity, it can better handle the increased complexity of the “Jigsaw++” task and thus extract better representation.</p>
<h3 id="c-transfer-knowledge-back-to-alexnet">c. Transfer Knowledge back to AlexNet</h3>
<p>The representations from VGG-16 are clustered and cluster centers are converted to pseudo-labels. Then, AlexNet is trained to classify the pseudo-labels.</p>
<h3 id="d-finetune-alexnet-on-evaluation-datasets">d. Finetune AlexNet on Evaluation datasets</h3>
<p>For downstream tasks, the convolutional layers for the AlexNet model are initialized with weights from pseudo-label classification and the fully connected layers were randomly initialized.
The pre-trained AlexNet is then finetuned on various benchmark datasets.</p>
<h3 id="e-results">e. Results</h3>
<p>Using a deeper network like VGG-16 leads to better representation and pseudo-labels and also better results in benchmark tasks. It got state of the art results on several benchmarks in 2018 and reduced the gap between supervised and self-supervised methods further.</p>
<h4 id="1-transfer-learning-on-pascal-voc">1. Transfer Learning on PASCAL VOC</h4>
<p>The authors tested their method on object classification and detection on PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset and semantic segmentation on PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset.</p>
<div>
<h4>Insights</h4>
<ul>
<li>Training Jigsaw++ with VGG16 and using AlexNet to predict cluster gives the best performance.</li>
<li>Switching to a challenging pretext task "Jigsaw++" improves performance than "Jigsaw".</li>
<li>Knowledge transfer doesn't have a significant impact when using the same architecture AlexNet in both Jigsaw++ and downstream tasks.</li>

<h4 id="2-linear-classification-on-imagenet">2. Linear Classification on ImageNet</h4>
<p>In this, a linear classifier is trained on features extracted from AlexNet at different convolutional layers. For ImageNet, using VGG-16 and transferring knowledge to AlexNet using clustering gives a substantial boost of 2%.</p>

<h4 id="1-how-does-the-number-of-clusters-affect-the-performance">1. How does the number of clusters affect the performance?</h4>
<p>The network is not significantly affected by the number of clusters. The authors tested AlexNet trained on pseudo-labels from a different number of clusters on the task of object detection.</p>

<h4 id="2-how-is-this-different-from-knowledge-distillation">2. How is this different from Knowledge Distillation?</h4>
<p>Knowledge transfer is fundamentally different from knowledge distillation. Here, the goal is to only preserve the cluster association of images from the representation and transfer that to the target model. Unlike distillation, we don’t do any regression to the exact output of the teacher.</p>
<h4 id="3-can-you-use-different-datasets-in-clustering-vs-predicting-pseudo-labels">3. Can you use different datasets in clustering vs predicting pseudo-labels?</h4>
<p>Yes, the method is flexible and you can pre-train on one dataset, cluster on another, and get pseudo-labels for the third one.</p>

<p>Most code running on the web is event-based, garbage-collected, and dynamically typed.
In stark contrast, Rust is a compiled language with static type- and memory-safety without a garbage-collector.
What are the implications for a project that compiles Rust to WebAssembly?

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Today, I tell a tale of a cultural clash.
Programming culture, that is.
The JavaScript culture on one end, and the Rust culture on the other.
<!-- But it is a culture nevertheless. -->
<!-- What do I mean by *programming culture", I hear you ask. -->
<!-- For me, this is a set of programming paradigms that are often used together. -->
<!-- As an example, take object-oriented programming -->
<!-- Some programmers are very attached to their programming language of choice. -->
<!-- Usually, because that language turned out to be very suitable for  --></p>

<p>To lay down the necessary foundation, I start by talking about what makes the two ecosystems unique and different from each other.
This leads to the suggestion that it might be difficult to write idiomatic Rust code that runs in the browser.
I want to find out how viable it is and when it makes sense to use Rust in the browser.</p>

<!-- I sketch a possible solution to the proposed dilemma with some Rust code. -->
<!-- Using these idea, I will alVery briefly, I will introduce a new publish-subscribe library called *Nuts*, which I have been working on in the last months. -->
<!-- A full coverage of the library will follow in the next blog post. -->

<h2 id="the-land-of-javascript">The land of JavaScript</h2>
<h3 id="how-the-browser-was-intended-to-be-used">How the Browser was Intended to be Used</h3>
<!-- I am definitely not an expert on the history of browsers, I was too young to program when browsers first saw the light of day.  -->
<!-- light of day? -->
<!-- But to make a point about the fundamentally different approach of JavaScript compared to Rust, I have to write a little bit about the fundamental design elements of JavaScript as the main programming language for browsers. -->

<p>When browsers have first been created, people were very excited.
Text and images could be placed and styled with dozens of possibilities.
It is a second Gutenberg Revolution, everyone gets access to an infinite amount of information that was previously unreachable. What a great achievement!</p>

<p>Then, those elements became interactive with the addition of a scripting language that can run directly in the browser and modify what is displayed.
Suddenly, the browser looks less like a book on a screen and more like newspapers from Harry Potter.</p>

<!-- Code running in the browser was added as an additional nice-to-have feature. -->
<p>Fast-forward to 2020, browsers are the doorstep to so much more than just animated books.
Everyone uses them for everything.
Be it watching videos of cute cats or managing stock portfolios. It all happens in the browser nowadays.
JavaScript evolved to support all these different use cases.</p>

<!-- To make the transition from 1995 to now, JavaScript had to address several major points.
Back then, programming complex code JavaScript was *cumbersome* and the results in the browser *slow* and *insecure*.
We are blessed that this topic received so much attention by browser developers that, by and large, the issues have been resolved. -->

<h3 id="the-javascript-core-features">The JavaScript Core Features</h3>
<p>The inhabitants of JavaScript land, let us call them <em>JavaScriptler</em> from now on, are very open people.
It is one of their greatest strengths that they cooperate with many other JavaScriptlers.
Communication between them has to be easy and without any road blockers.
This idea is at the heart of JavaScript’s culture.</p>

<p>The downside is that they naively run anyone’s code.
To avoid major damage being inflicted by an adversary JavaScriptler, a code running in JavaScript land had to be limited in what it can do.
We also say it executes in a sandbox within the browser.
While other languages like C or Python communicate directly with the host operating system (OS), JavaScript can only communicate with the browser.</p>

<!-- As a result, modern websites are full of code and there are highly dynamic interactions between DOM elements. -->

<!-- To address the speed problems that come with such a sandbox, just-in-time (JIT) compilers [BOOKMARK TODO] put traditional compilers to shame with their crazy-efficient compilation times and remarkable optimizations at runtime. -->

<p>A huge number of libraries and frameworks in JavaScript land have tried to make programming more accessible and simple.
Their combined power is really what defined modern life in JavaScript land.
Arguably, the sheer number of frameworks made it more complex than it has simplified thing.
But there is always just the basic JavaScript without frameworks as the baseline.
For today, I want to talk only about that fundament of JavaScript and its interactions with the browser.</p>

<p>Memory management is a big differentiator of programming languages.
Any language has to provide means to allocate and release memory but the approach can vary.
In JavaScript, it is all done silently in the background.
And sharing memory between functions and closures could not be simpler, it just works.
This fits very well in the general philosophy of JavaScript land, enabling easy communication.</p>

<p>Simple memory management is enabled by the garbage-collectors, which are a bunch of very busy inhabitants of the land.
They clean up all the leftover memory by fast-paced communication of busy programs that cannot be bothered to tidy up behind themselves.
<!-- Running in an execution environment provided by the browser allows to make design choices like using a garbage-collector. -->
<!-- Natively compiled languages, like Rust, basically have to cope with what ever the hardware and operating system provides them. -->
<!-- The designers of JavaScript have had a bit more freedom here. -->
<!-- Another important choice has been made when the JavaScript event loop has been defined. -->
<!-- -T-O-D-O-: Example of JS with easy data sharing, that will not go well with Rust. --></p>

<p>This should give you an idea of how a JavaScriptler thinks.
But there is one more very important topic to cover, the <em>event loop</em>.
Let me explain what the event loop is in the next section, it will be important in the comparison to Rust.</p>

<h3 id="the-javascript-event-loop">The JavaScript Event Loop</h3>
<!-- and how it Prevents Race Conditions -->
<p>The land of JavaScript is ruled by a thing called <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop"><em>the event loop</em></a>, which schedules different tasks (threads) to run orderly.
It defines several rules that all code living in the browser has to obey.
For simple JavaScript programming, it is usually okay not to worry about them.
But then there are also quite basic cases in which it matters a lot.</p>

<p>Below is a JavaScript example with a promise, a timeout of 0 seconds, and some console logging.
If you can tell me with confidence in what order the output appears, you have studied the event loop laws well.</p>

<p><a href="https://jsfiddle.net/2oL4s7km/6/">JS Fiddle</a></p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>// Create promise which resolves after a timeout of 0ms.</span>
<span>// This forces the promise to be enqueue as a new thread in </span>
<span>// the event loop instead of executing immediately in this thread.</span>
<span>// The function within the timeout acts very much like</span>
<span>// a thread in other programming models.</span>
<span>let</span> <span>promise</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Promise</span><span>((</span><span>resolve</span><span>,</span> <span>reject</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
  <span>setTimeout</span><span>(</span>
    <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>[A] Inside Promise</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
      <span>resolve</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>DONE</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}),</span>
  <span>0</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>// Add another message after promise has been resolved.</span>
<span>promise</span><span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span>
  <span>result</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>[B] Promise returned: </span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>result</span><span>),</span>
  <span>error</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>[C] Promise failed: </span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>// Write to the console when this code block finshes executing.</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>[D] End of code</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>

<span>// SOLUTION</span>
<span>// Output order: D, A, B</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If the output comes as a surprise to you, you should learn about rule number one of the event loop.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Once a thread is running, it runs to completion without interruptions of other threads.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the example above, this means that even though the timeout has been set to be resolved immediately, it has to wait in the queue until the currently running thread is done.
If you have understood this one rule, you know enough about the JavaScript to follow the rest of the article.</p>

<p>But why does this rule exist?
Would it not be more efficient to start executing the second thread of the example immediately?
Especially, considering that virtually all modern consumer devices have multiple cores which could work on the two threads in parallel.
I am glad you asked.</p>

<h3 id="race-conditions-not-with-javascript">Race conditions? Not with JavaScript!</h3>
<p>When the result of some code depends on the order in which the threads access the same data, we call that a <em>race condition</em>.
Sometimes, this is intended and perfectly fine.
But in other cases, the programmer does not even know that there is a race condition, hence not all possible outcomes will be accounted for. In that case, race conditions are bad.</p>

<!-- Complicated bugs may occur only in very specific timing conditions. -->
<!-- This is the kind of bug ticket your typical lazy programmer would just close as *not-reproducible*. -->
<!-- Until it happens when someone important watches, when it suddenly becomes the focus of the entire team for days if not weeks. -->

<p>There are different solutions to avoid the risk of race conditions.
The founders of JavaScript thought about this carefully. 
They came to a drastic conclusion and decided that no concurrency between threads is allowed, for the safety of everybody.</p>

<p>This resolves the race conditions by removing the possibility that multiple threads ever run at the same time.
However, the existence of multiple threads should still be allowed, or otherwise, it would be very annoying to write code.
So they came up with the event loop, which sequentially runs one thread after another without interleaving them.</p>

<h3 id="clicker-game-example-in-javascript">Clicker Game Example in JavaScript</h3>

<p>Here is some example code in JavaScript for a simple clicker game where a player collects apples.</p>



<p>The variables <code>apples</code> and <code>trees</code> in this example are allocated automatically and they are easily accessible from other functions and threads, just like JavaScriptlers are used to.
There is also no race condition here, thanks to the event loop.
Without it, (A) <code>apples -= 1;</code> within the <code>buy()</code> function would have a race condition with (B) <code>apples += trees;</code> in the closure given to <code>setInterval()</code>.</p>

<p>How is it a race condition?
Assume <code>apples</code> is 10 and <code>trees</code> is 5;
In the normally intended timing, after both statements execute, the result should be 14 apples and 6 trees.
But with one possible timing of a multi-core processor, A reads 10 and B reads 10,too before A has a chance to write.
Then A writes 9, which is immediately overwritten by B writing 15, so we end up with 15 apples and 6 trees. (Buying the tree was for free.)
This is possible because <code>+=</code> is not an atomic operation in hardware, it will be compiled into a read, add, and write operation executed sequentially.</p>

<p>Times have changed but the traditions of our ancestors have remained unchallenged within the browser. Most people in JavaScript have probably forgotten about the problem with race conditions because the problem has long been solved for them.
But there are other regions, outside the browser, which have found different solutions to race condition problem.</p>

<!-- ### Asynchronous and Parallel Code in JavaScript
The demonstrated behavior in the previous example is a direct consequence of the concurrency model used in JavaScript.
It has proven itself to be very useful for event-based programming.
For example, when registering two event-listeners on HTML UI elements, the registering code will not be interrupted by the first event being fired. This avoids a lot of tricky cases which are easily forgotten by programmers.

```js
TODO: Example with jQuery initilization
button A: set text to AAA and remove listener on B
button B: set text to BBB and remove listener on A
```

The problem of the model is that multi-core machine (desktops, laptops, phones, ...) cannot easily use all their cores to parallelize the workload because all asynchronous tasks are executed in sequence.
It is of course possible to do parallel programming in JavaScript, but it is a bit more involved.

I think it is fair to say that JavaScript has not initially been designed with parallel programming in mind.
There was simply no reason for it just to manipulate a few hundred DOM nodes.
But the world has moved on from the 90s. Browsers are used for more than just displaying text and static images. Devices use many cores. 
Thus, it is time to enable easier parallel programming. -->

<!-- 
 - JS
    - Portable (Not compiled)
    - JIT for performance (JS magic)
    - Single-threaded with run-to-completion scheduling on the event loop(?)
 - DOM
    - Code mostly just manipulates DOM
 - Events
    - Closures everywhere
    - Many cross references for shared data
 - Garbage collection -->

<h2 id="the-land-of-rust">The land of Rust</h2>
<!-- ### What Rust was Designed for -->
<!-- 
 - Compiled to CPU native assembly
 - Lots of type information to support compile-time optimizations (Rust magic)
 - Memory safety without garbage collection
    - Compiler needs to know a lot about memory usage
    - Data sharing avoided as much as possible
    - single root of execution tree
 - Multi-threading built into the language/std -->
<!-- Ah, where should I even start with Rust. -->
<!-- I am definitely a bit of a fanboy for the language but I will try to stay factual. -->

<p><img src="https://www.jakobmeier.ch/assets/img/20/private_drive.jpg" alt="Image: A private road with a friendly sign."></p>

<p>A Rust citizen, also known as Rustacean, is very picky about its program code, as opposed to the openness found in JavaScriptlers.
All programs have to be scanned by the compiler and nothing is executed before all checks are done.</p>

<p>And rules to get in Rust land are very strict indeed.
Trying to smuggle through an ordinary <code>7</code> as an <code>f32</code>?
Nope, the <code>7</code> only qualifies for integers, you would have to use <code>7.0</code> instead.
That type of narrow thinking is very typical in Rust land.
<!-- Everything has to be compiled completely into native instructions.
compiles it code to native instructions  with a strong type system.
Zero cost abstractions allow for high-level concepts to be compiled into native binary code that requires no dedicated runtime environment. --></p>

<p>Many of the early Rustaceans are refugees from C++, which is one of the countries impacted the hardest by race conditions.
It is therefore deeply engraved into Rustaceans that they want to prevent any future race condition disasters.
But they are used to build very performance-oriented stuff for a living.
Operating systems, numerical libraries, and world simulations are daily business for a Rustacean.</p>

<p>Naturally, they depend a lot on the benefits of multi-processors. They cannot do without.
The single-threaded approach as seen in JavaScript is not an option in Rust land.</p>

<p>“Civil Rap Song,” a <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/international/9392471/japan-dos-monos-civil-rap-song-taiwan-digital-minister-audrey-tang-watch-new-video">track</a> by the Japanese hip-hop trio Dos Monos, begins not with an MC’s rhymes but a faraway voice speaking slow, bureaucratic English. The deconstructed audio is sampled over gloomy synth:<em> “If you overemphasize … amplifying the public and private sector … where is the civic sector? … where is the social sector?”</em> Made in less than a week during Japan’s state of emergency over Covid-19, the track was intended to be “culturally empowering,” according to a band member — a way to remind the public that it still had choices, even in the midst of a crisis.</p>



<p>The speaker in the song is 39-year-old Audrey Tang, a prodigy hacker turned activist turned digital minister in the Taiwanese government. Tang, who wears rimless glasses and dark, baggy clothes by Issey Miyake, does not fit the profile of a rapper’s muse. Yet over the course of the coronavirus pandemic, which her country has managed with singular, tech-enabled ease, she has become an international messenger of Taiwan’s “radically transparent” “digital democracy.” For Tang, the Taiwanese model offers an imitable middle ground: between the internet and personal privacy; between corporate interests and the welfare state.</p>



<p>Before Covid-19, you may have heard of Tang if you followed Taiwanese news, tech gossip, or transgender politics. She is considered one of Taiwan’s top coders, having taught herself the programming languages Haskell and Perl before developing software for Apple that would be used in Siri. In the spring of 2014, when news that Taiwan’s then-president Ma Ying-jeou had threatened the island nation’s independence by attempting to force through a trade deal with China, Tang quit a job at Socialtext, where she worked on Google Suite–like productivity software, to join a scrum of hackers gathered outside the main government building in Taipei. This was the beginning of the Sunflower Movement, a popular uprising against the prospect of national absorption, and Tang helped broadcast the protests and debates online. After a nearly monthlong occupation, Ma was forced to abandon the pact, and the Sunflower activists turned to political organizing. They successfully ran progressive candidates in the 2014 local elections and, in 2016, elected Tsai Ing-wen as president. Tsai’s administration recruited Tang to become the first out transgender person in Taiwan’s executive cabinet.</p>



<p>While Tang’s title is “digital minister,” she is a minister without a ministry. As one of nine <a href="http://www.politicseastasia.com/research/audrey_tang_interview/">“horizontal ministers,”</a> she advises other parts of the government on all things tech — and, because she happens to be obsessed with the U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goals — environmental overlaps. In 2017, for instance, she and her staff worked with the Ministry of the Interior and a risk-management agency to combine separate systems used to prevent and respond to natural disasters. Upon Tang’s recommendation, the government agreed to implement a new cloud-based interface to trim costs and give the public quick, easy access to information on floods, fires, and extreme weather. Last year, during the second <a href="https://www.roc-taiwan.org/uk_en/post/6295.html">“presidential hackathon,”</a> an annual event that invites startup-style ideas for governance, she helped facilitate the development of a solar-powered device that can measure and log water-pollution levels on an open-source blockchain. Soon, any citizen worried about downstream industrial waste will be able to buy a few of these monitors, drop them in a creek, and create a dataset to hold corporations and local officials accountable to environmental regulations.</p>



<p>This is clearly government work, but Tang, at her core a hacker iconoclast, bristles at the notion that she works <em>for </em>Taipei. She still prefers to see herself as a liaison, or, in her words, “a moderator or editor,” between the public and the state. This explains why Tang — though not a doctor or epidemiologist — found herself at the center of Taiwan’s response to Covid-19.&nbsp;</p>

<hr>



<p>When rumors of a dangerous flu emerged from Wuhan, China, last December, the Taiwanese reacted fast. Carrying the memory of the 2003 SARS epidemic, they rushed to buy face masks, threatening to deplete local supplies. In the city of Tainan, an engineer named Howard Wu created a fix: a mapping system to track available masks, using Google GPS and Places API. The platform was an immediate hit. Tang reached out to Wu and secured funding from Google to support and extend the project, which eventually inspired a similar system in South Korea. By spring, the Taiwanese government was managing the supply and distribution of cheap N95-type masks through neighborhood pharmacies. All 24 million residents of Taiwan could buy a certain number per week, at any pharmacy, based on their national health insurance card. Long lines got shorter, and people went about social distancing with confidence. The success of this model — Taiwan has had fewer than 500 total cases and just seven deaths — was what attracted the Dos Monos rappers to Tang.</p>



<p>It helped that, in East Asia, masks were “already ‘natural’ before the pandemic; we didn’t have to invent new things,” Tang said. In response to the common, mostly Western critique that East Asian technocracy relies too much on digital surveillance, Tang explained that Taiwan’s containment method involved “a deep but very narrow and time-limited privacy infringement: You either, when flying back, go to the quarantine hotel for 14 days, or you can choose the digital fence,” that is, submit to strict tracking. “We do not collect new data,” she added. “It’s not a new app. It’s not GPS. People understand it’s proportional.” Taiwan also invested in fact-checking startups and enlisted comedians to craft lighthearted responses to Covid-19 disinformation and consumer misbehavior. In a public-service announcement intended to stem panic-buying of toilet paper, a cartoon version of Tang’s boss, Premier Su Tseng-chang, shimmies his rear end beneath the <a href="https://qz.com/1863931/taiwan-is-using-humor-to-quash-coronavirus-fake-news/">words</a>, “You only have one butt.”</p>



<p>When I spoke with Tang via Skype in July, she referred to Taiwan as “post-pandemic.” The country had never shut down completely, and its streets, markets, and schools were beginning to feel normal. She had just made her morning commute in downtown Taipei, a 15-minute walk from Da’an Park, past the Jianguo flower market, to a broad concrete complex surrounded by lush trees. There, in an open-air arcade that once belonged to the air force, is the Social Innovation Lab, the headquarters of Tang’s digital non-ministry. She dialed in from her office, which resembled the lounge of a coworking space. A vertical Chinese scroll hung over her right shoulder: “More and more graceful every day.”</p>



<p>Tang had been holding public “office hours” on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and was booked through September to chat with locals about tech and government policy, entrepreneurship, and sustainability. Nearly all her interactions, including media interviews and meetings with lobbyists, are subject to a “radical transparency” policy: They are recorded, transcribed, and posted online for all to see. Tang also holds regular virtual visits with communities all over Taiwan.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“<strong>Any top-down, coercion, whether it’s from the capitalists or from the state, is equally bad.”</strong></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>During a recent one, entrepreneurs from Taiwan’s indigenous community pressed for changes to the business code. Tang listened and recalled a solution she helped devise last year, when Taiwan became the first Asian country to legalize same-sex marriage. Many older, conservative Taiwanese could accept that gay people should have equal rights but felt reluctant to have their extended-family registries — official, patrilineal records stretching back to the early 20th century — reflect LGBT unions. The fix was a “hyperlink act” that, with a single click, would amend relevant sections of the civil code to give queer couples the same rights and duties as anyone else but would not, as with straight marriages, “hyperlink to the in-laws,” meaning that the families of the same-sex couple wouldn’t be permanently bonded in the eyes of the state. “Their families don’t wed. It’s the individuals that wed,” she told me. “It’s a social innovation that convinced both generations that the values that they cherish are not disrupted when we pass marriage equality. It’s marriage equality with intergenerational solidarity.”</p>



<p>It’s also a compromise. Tang, whose mother was active in Taiwan’s cooperative movement before the country transitioned to democracy, much prefers collaboration to battle. This might relate as well to another aspect of Tang’s childhood: she was born with a heart defect and often talks about the virtues of unhurried observation. “If you’re slow in your motion, you tend to notice other, nonhuman beings,” she told me — trees, rivers, computers. As digital minister, she invoked this cooperative ideal to implement Pol.is, an online discussion board where Taiwanese people can engage in a “rough-consensus process” about social issues, such as what sorts of rules should govern Uber or how best to combat the spread of revenge porn.

<p>Taiwan’s constitution prohibits private businesses from acting against “the balanced development of national wealth and people’s livelihood,” yet the country’s most famous corporation is high-tech Apple supplier Foxconn, which gained notoriety for driving its mainland Chinese factory workers to suicide. I asked whether the cruelties of big businesses hadn’t dimmed Tang’s faith in the possibility of social equilibrium. “The manufacturing companies, they learned, of course, not to do [things with] adverse effects within Taiwan proper,” she replied, referring to Foxconn’s compounds in mainland China. But the next generation of Taiwanese entrepreneurs, she said, will use robotics to reduce worker exploitation, embrace “worker associations,” and pursue …</p></div></div>

<p>While I was browsing social media, I came across a tweet that said, “You’re too junior [in software development] if you’re using the mouse.” My initial reaction was just an eye-roll. But then, I realized that there’s more to talk about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Keyboard and Mouse are tools, just like VSCode, Vim, Emacs, Rails, Ruby, JavaScript, you name them. They are essential because they help us to get things done faster and more reliably.&nbsp;<br>I see many developers spending significant amounts of time debating the right choice (why emacs is better than vim, JavaScript is trash, you name it). <br>I’m not here to weigh in on any of these specific discussions and arguments instead of getting the discussion on a higher level.</p>



<p>As software developers, we spend time talking about how <strong>we</strong> feel using this particular language, framework, or tool. <strong>We</strong> can get stuff done so much faster in Vim than Sublime Text, using tabs instead of spaces, etc.</p>



<p>But what if you would make the choice based on the optimal end result for your customer? Imagine you’d choose Rails over Sinatra or vice versa because you could ship six months earlier than planned. Or you could add offline support to your web application without breaking a sweat, and your customers’ productivity would go through the roof.</p>



<p><em>How does that feel?</em></p>



<p>Getting there means to look at your tooling from a different point of view. Do you understand how a particular tool fits into your company infrastructure and workflows?&nbsp;<br>For instance, I’ve seen Developers choosing something very sophisticated but hard to learn and use. Why? Because it might express their intellectual prowess, thinking that this makes them more senior. In reality, it’s not the case.</p>



<p>What makes you more senior is team-enablement. Instead of having everyone else put in the effort to get to your level, you put in the effort to help your teammates level up.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>How does that look like?&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>For instance, your company uses a build system that’s currently challenging to use with time-intensive maintenance.&nbsp;<br>Everybody comes to you if they are struggling with getting builds to work. Every one of these support requests takes away your and your teammate’s time to deliver value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If this accumulates too much time spent on maintenance, let’s find a way to reduce this again. You could write additional documentation that explains steps better, or, if that doesn’t cut it, lead efforts internally to replace this system with something more user-friendly.&nbsp;<br>Whatever you do, and the more senior you become, the more it is your responsibility to get roadblocks out of the way for others so they can deliver value to your customers and users.&nbsp;<br>Once you deliver your product to the end-user, they won’t know, nor would they care how much effort you put into it. Sophisticated terminal setups and cutting-edge technologies don’t matter. They need to know that it works on their devices, that they can do what they’re good at reliably with your software.</p>

    <p>RSS: </p> <p><a href="https://reyammer.io/blog/index.xml"><img src="https://reyammer.io/rss.png" width="23px"></a></p>

  <p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/reyammer/status/1311338230139232258" target="_blank">news is out</a>: I left France, I'm no longer a professor at EURECOM, I joined the Malware Research Team at CISCO Talos, and I moved to beautiful Vienna. Big change :-)</p>
<p>I have been a professor for a bit more than three years, but I have had contrasting feelings about the "prof job" for a long time (even before finishing my PhD), it took me a couple of years to realize that I would eventually have needed to move on, and it took even more (mental) effort to actually make the call and leave. Despite being <em>very</em> excited for what's next, oh boy, this was tough :-) But independently of the concrete next step, it was time to move on. Even if Talos realizes the mistake and kicks me out next week, I'm still confident that moving on was the right call.</p>
<p>Especially when it comes to take big decisions, I tend to obsess about trying to stay rational, and I spent years collecting notes on the various pros/cons. Many of these thoughts often started surfacing as "feeling something is not right", without consciously understanding what was going on. But by keep thinking and writing notes down, patterns of thoughts started to emerge and I was eventually able to pinpoint some more defined thoughts on what kept me on the current job and what pushed me to change. Once these reasons were clear, it was much easier to take the decision.</p>
<p>This is a very long blog post, and I don't expect more than a very few people to actually read it. I wrote it mostly for selfish reasons: before changing to a new life, I wanted to wrap up all these notes in something more structured. I can't be certain I took a good decision, but systematizing these thoughts allowed me to move on with enough confidence to know I'm likely making a step forward.</p>
<p>With that being said, I know that someone may be actually interested in hearing these thoughts and my experience. When I was a PhD student and I needed to take the notorious academia vs. industry decision, I would have paid big bucks to read more thoughts on the various pros/cons. One of the stupidest things you can do is to take big decisions based on what other people do and think, but reading about other people's thought process has helped me a lot. It is time I do my part.</p>
<p>The target audience for this post is, other than myself, PhD students / postdocs that are about to decide what to do next and junior profs that somehow feel that "something is wrong". I also expect some senior academics and industry people to read this post, but I guess they will find themselves skipping directly to the academic rant part and mostly agree with much I have to say :-) Anyways, I tried to stay away from the "very known things" (e.g., 👀-level BS when writing proposals, generally "more limited" immediate impact of your work, different compensation level, etc.), and I tried to focus on thoughts I have not seen much discussed around (at least not in this depth).</p>
<p>So, if you feel clueless and you want to hear more from an equivalently clueless random dude on the Internet, here we are :-) If you think this is <em>the</em> blog post that will make everything clear, I have a bad news for you: it's all about tradeoffs and in my opinion there is no clear-cut winner. And, unfortunately, the problem with tradeoffs and balancing many aspects is that figuring out which one to weigh more is yet another very personal decision in its own way. So, you will not find any answer in this post and you will eventually need to figure this thing out on your own, but I hope this will help you forming your own opinion.</p>
<p>This post is organized in three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#part-1-the-good-mdash-what-pushed-me-to-keep-the-job">Part 1: The Good — What pushed me to keep the job</a></li>
<li><a href="#part-2-the-bad-mdash-what-pushed-me-to-leave-the-job">Part 2: The Bad — What pushed me to leave the job</a></li>
<li><a href="#part-3-the-bye-bye-mdash-the-decision-to-leave">Part 3: The Bye Bye — The decision to leave</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

Please feel free to reach out, ping me on twitter, or shoot me an email: I'm of course happy to share more thoughts if you have any question. And if you disagree with something, bring it on!

<br>
<h2 id="part-1-the-good-mdash-what-pushed-me-to-keep-the-job">Part 1: The Good — What pushed me to keep the job</h2>
<p>Before I discuss why I left, I want to touch on what pushed me to keep the job. I want to make sure it's a balanced post despite the upcoming mega rant, so that my overall opinion is more closely reflected. And I really don't want to discourage anyone to take this path, I still think it is a great one.</p>
<p>Note that some of my "reasons to stay" are good, but some are bad. Also note that many of these refer to my personal situation at EURECOM, working in the field of systems security, and not all these points can be generalized to all universities. As they say, your mileage may vary.</p>
<h3 id="its-a-very-good-job">It's a very good job</h3>
<p>The first pros is... 🥁: "it's a very good job". At first, I was shocked to find out that it's an actual job. When I joined this prof thingy I thought that this would be a "job" (note the double quotes). But, while it's true that you don't have a direct boss that tells you what to do, at the end of the day you need to deliver, and you actually work very hard: If your PhD students are in trouble or you teaching sucks, you will run into problems. This doesn't necessarily mean "they kick out", but if you value being a professional (and I do), failing at your core tasks will make you feel bad, even without additional pressure from your superior, and even if you have tenure.</p>
<p>And now that we got this "it's an actual job" out of the way, I can tell you: it's a very good one. There is <em>a lot</em> of freedom in what you do and how you structure your time. Research-wise I felt very free (but you eventually work on what your students like to work on — as it should be), and the department values the right things (I've heard some BS in other schools where, in the context of systems security research, they pressure you to "publish more journal papers..." 🤦‍♂️). I really like teaching and mentoring, and there were many opportunities to do so. They let me create and teach my own class on mobile security, <a href="https://mobisec.reyammer.io/" target="_blank">MOBISEC</a>, and the teaching load is overall very low (1 or 1.5 classes per year). I love playing CTFs and I was even <em>encouraged</em> to spend time and push for NOPS, the EURECOM CTF team (after winning <a href="https://ctftime.org/event/647" target="_blank">HXP CTF 2018</a> and after being referred to as "<a href="https://youtu.be/j0taw78tCYs?t=968" target="_blank">probably a top team</a>" we are mostly enjoying our eternal and well-deserved glory).</p>
<p>The environment is extremely relaxed, informal, and friendly. You are surrounded by top-skilled colleagues and humans, from MS students to profs. I felt in a family from day 1. Last very good point: since in France positions come with tenure, there were not even problems in terms of pre-tenure stress, a real luxury. And on this aspect, EURECOM delivered: I never felt any sort of pressure (but: I did work my ass off... so if you stop doing anything, bad things may happen :-)).</p>
<p>[BTW, EURECOM is frantically trying to replace me, you should apply :-)]</p>
<h3 id="you-are-surrounded-by-students">You are surrounded by students</h3>
<p>When I took my decision to remain in academia, my top reason was for teaching and mentorship. Probably the best perk of the job is that you are surrounded by people eager to learn, from MS to PhD students to postdocs. It is extremely fulfilling and rewarding. Working with my students has been the highlight of my time at EURECOM, from traditional teaching, to suffering through the various rejections, to celebrating defeats of Reviewer #2, to cluelessly getting CTF-close in many stego CTF challenges. I feel very lucky that during these years we found enough interesting ideas that we enjoyed working on together, and that my next job will allow me to keep advising them until they graduate. As a prof, I believe the net output of my work is to see students becoming independent researchers, not the actual papers — I can't wait to see the bright careers I'm sure they will have :-)</p>
<h3 id="i-have-deep-respect-for-the-role-of-profs-in-society-and-it-felt-great-to-be-one">I have deep respect for the role of "profs" in society, and it felt great to be one</h3>
<p>I somehow have a profound admiration for the role that professors have in society and that had in my life. For their hard work, knowledge, passion, patience, and ultimately their service to the community. I'm referring to all teachers and mentors (from elementary schools to universities), who spend their life helping others, while at the same time often being asked to do many useless things and being massively underpaid. I admire and deeply respect these efforts: my most sincere thank you to all past, present, and future profs!</p>
<p>And, to be frank, it felt great to be one. I have been in love with the idea of being a prof for many years. In part, I think it is because some of the people who impacted me the most are professors, and I wanted to do my part in helping others. And after all the uncertainties that one has during a PhD, I think I was even more in love with the idea of having finally found my place in society. [Narrator: LOL, this clueless dude did not find his place. [Answer to narrator: But I've surely found it <em>now</em>!!1!]]</p>
<p>Overcoming all these positive emotions and feelings attached to this job was likely the biggest challenge I faced in coming to terms with the several problems and cons I did have during these three years. As mentioned, I have no intention to give up on this teaching/mentoring thing (taking the time for this long blog post is part of this!), but it will surely not be the same thing. I'm very grateful I had a chance to try this job out. Thanks to all who made it possible, from family to advisors, colleagues, and students ❤️. I owe you big time.</p>
<p>[Of course, being a prof does not necessarily make you a smart or great person. Some profs I know are some of the dumbest people I have ever met (by far) and they would not survive one day in the real world. And some profs I know are the most asshole, selfish, egomaniac, and delusional humans I have ever heard of (Are you pushing your students to stay in the lab …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                        <p>It’s been two years since I started working as a software engineer.
I sometimes tell my colleagues about a student project I did in my junior year of university,
and it’s so well-received that I’m writing this post.
<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Now, let me ask you a question. Have you ever designed your own ISA, built a processor of that ISA on FPGA, and built a compiler for it?
Furthermore, have you run an operating system on that processor?
Actually, we have.</p>
<p>In this post, I’m going to talk about my undergraduate days in 2015,
our four months of building a home-built CPU of a home-built RISC ISA,
building a home-built C toolchain, and porting Xv6, a Unix-like OS, to that CPU.</p>
<h2 id="cpu-experiment-at-the-university-of-tokyo">CPU Experiment at the University of Tokyo</h2>
<p>It was all done as a student experiment project called CPU Experiment.
So, let’s start with what is CPU experiment.</p>
<p>CPU experiment is a little famous exercise held in the winter of the junior year in my department,
the Department of Information Science at the University of Tokyo.
In the experiment, students are divided into groups of four or five students.
Each group designs an own CPU architecture, implements it on an FPGA,
builds an OCaml subset compiler for that CPU, and then runs a given ray-tracing program on the CPU.
Typically, one or two people are responsible for each of the CPU, FPU, CPU simulator and compiler.
I was in charge of the CPU in my group, Group 6.</p>
<p>This exercise is well known for the high expectation of self learning.
The instructor only asks the students to “take this ray-tracing program written in OCaml and run it on your CPU implemented on an FPGA”, and the class ends.
He/she doesn’t tell much about the concrete steps of how to write CPU and compilers.
The students learn for themselves how to embody the general knowledge of CPUs and compilers learned in previous lectures to the level of real circuits and code.
Well, this is a very tough exercise, but very exciting and educational.</p>
<h2 id="lets-run-operating-system-on-our-own-cpu">Let’s run Operating System on our own CPU.</h2>
<p>As some of you may have noticed, I didn’t talk about operating system at all.
I’ll add a little explanation.</p>
<p>Typically, the experiment proceeds as follows.
First, you make a CPU that works reliably, no matter how slow it is.
If you can make a working CPU and successfully run the ray-tracing program, you can earn the credit of the experiment.
After that, your team has a free time.
The traditional way to spend this free time is to further speed up their CPU.
In past experiments, students have made out-of-order CPU, VLIEW CPU, multi-core CPU, or even superscalar CPU, which is amazing.</p>
<p>However, some teams put more energy into doing fun such as running games or playing music by connecting a speaker with their CPU.
Group 6, to which I belonged, was a group of such people who loved entertainment,
and we decided to run an OS as our team goal.</p>
<p>As a result of other groups showing interest in this idea, a joint group of about 8 people, Group X,
was formed, and their goal was “Let’s run an OS on our own CPU!”</p>
<p>Although I was in charge of creating a CPU in Group 6,
this time I chose to be the leader of the OS team in the Group X.
So this post is written primarily from the perspective of the OS team,
but of course I also introduce the overall group’s results.</p>
<h2 id="xv6">Xv6</h2>
<p>As the OS to be ported, we chose Xv6, a simple Unix v6-inspired OS created by MIT for educational purposes.
Xv6 is written in ANSI C, unlike Unix v6, and it runs on x86.
Xv6 is an educational OS, so its features are a bit poor, but it has sufficient features as a simple Unix-like OS.
You can find more information of Xv6 on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xv6" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>

 or <a href="https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public" target="_blank">the GitHub repository</a>

.</p>
<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<p>In porting xv6, there are a lot of challenges on the software side alone because we were trying to create everything from scratch.</p>
<p><strong>1. C Compiler and tool chain for Xv6</strong></p>
<p>In the CPU experiment, we usually create an ML compiler. Naturally, you can’t compile C codes of Xv6.</p>
<p><strong>2. What kind of CPU features required for operating system?</strong></p>
<p>Privilege protections? Virtual address? Interrupt?
Yes, we had overall understanding of what operating system does by lectures,
but we didn’t have solid enough understanding to explain what specific CPU features could make that happen at that time.</p>
<p><strong>3. What about the simulator?</strong></p>
<p>We had a simulator made in the core part of CPU experiment,
but it was a simple one that executes one instruction by instruction,
and there was no interruption or no virtual address conversion.</p>
<p><strong>4. Low portability of xv6</strong></p>
<p>Xv6 was not very portable.
For example, it assumes the <code>char</code> is 1 byte and <code>int</code> is 4 bytes, and manipulates the stack heavily.
Well, the name “Xv6” I guess comes from x86 and Unix “v6”, so it’s kind of natural.</p>
<p>We had a lot of concerns, but started the Group X’s OS porting project in December.<br>
From here I’m going to write about what we did in roughly chronological order.
It’s a little bit long, so if you want to look at our final products quickly, <a href="#march---xv6-runs">please jump to March</a>

.</p>
<h2 id="late-november---starting-the-compiler">Late November - Starting the compiler</h2>
<p>The first problem that we saw the answer to was the compiler and tool chain.
To be surprise, our decision was to build the C89 compiler from scratch.
To be honest, I hadn’t imagined that we would choose this way.
I remember I talked with Yuichi, who became in charge of CPU of Group X, about doing a gcc or llvm port at first.</p>
<p>However, one of the team members, Keiichi, suddenly said he had written a C compiler and showed us a prototype of a compiler with a simple parser and emitter.
It seemed more fun to write the toolchain from scratch, so we decided to write a compiler by ourselves.</p>
<p>Yuichi and Wataru from Group 3, who had already finished the core part of the experiment that year, joined Keiichi, and the Group X compiler team was born.
We later named our compiler Ucc.</p>
<h2 id="mid-december---the-os-team-is-up">Mid-December - The OS team is up!</h2>
<p>At the beginning of December, I completed my CPU, and Group 6 completed the core part of the CPU experiment.
So, we moved on to the fun part, Group X’s OS porting task.
At this time, myself and Shohei from Group 6 started working in Group X and became the OS team. Masayoshi joined it at the same time.</p>
<h3 id="core-part-of-the-experiment-writing-a-cpu">Core part of the experiment: Writing a CPU</h3>
<p>By the way, I guess not so many software engineers have ever written a CPU, so let me talk a little bit about making a CPU as well.</p>
<p>Nowadays, making a CPU doesn’t mean wiring every single jump wire on a breadboard; you write the circuitry in Hardware Description Language.
Then you synthesize that HDL into a real circuit using Vivado or Quartus.
This process is called logic synthesis, not compilation.</p>
<p>HDL and programming language are similar but different.
Think of it like writing a function that maps the signal state of registers to another signal state, triggered by a clock or input signal.
If you want to experience real reactive programming, I suggest you try writing an HDL.
Please also remember to write HDLs, always worrying about whether the signal propagation of the HDLs you write really ends up in one clock.
Otherwise, the behavior of your circuits would be incomprehensible to humans.</p>
<!-- You'd write a CPU state machine that decodes the machine instructions each time the clock rises, and then performs ALUs and branches accordingly, and updating the state of the exposed registers as an interface to the assembly. -->
<p>The hardest part of the actual development was that this logic synthesis took a ridiculous amount of time.
It was not uncommon for us to have to wait up to 30 minutes after starting the synthesis,
so once I started the synthesis,
I was often playing Smash Bros. Melee with the other CPU guys who were also waiting for the synthesis to finish.
FYI, my character was Sheik.</p>
<h2 id="late-december-to-mid-january---learn-by-porting-xv6-to-mips">Late December to mid-January - Learn by porting Xv6 to MIPS</h2>
<p>We began to find the answer to “What kind of CPU features required for operating system?”</p>
<p>After the OS team was born, we started weekly rounds of Xv6 source code reading.</p>
<p>At the same time, I started porting Xv6 to MIPS.
This was partly to learn how an OS works at the implementation level, and partly because there appeared to be no Xv6 port to MIPS.
I completed the port until the process scheduler started in about a week.
I did a lot of research on MIPS during this porting process,
and on x86 to understand how xv6 works.
Thanks to that, I understood mechanisms around interrupts and MMU at the implementation level.
At this stage I got a solid understanding of the CPU functionality required for Xv6.</p>
<p>Also, in mid-January, we worked hard to compile the entire Xv6 code by commenting out the various parts.
As a result, Xv6 on the simulator of our homebrew architecture showed the first message of the boot sequence,</p>
<pre><code>xv6...
cpu0: starting...
</code></pre><p>At the same time, this meant that by this time Ucc had already grown enough to compile most of xv6, which was awesome.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="february---our-cpu-gaia-was-born">February - our CPU, GAIA was born!</h2>
<p>In the MIPS port, I completed the initialization of the PIC, which was a real pain,
and also completed the implementation of the interrupt handler.
As a result, the porting of Xv6 to MIPS was completed until just before the first user program started.</p>
<p>Based on this experience, I made the draft specifications of the interrupt and virtual address translation for our homebrew CPU.
In order to keep it simple, we decided to omit hardware privilege mechanisms like Ring protection.
For virtual address translation, we decided to use a hardware page-walking method, just like x86.
It may seem difficult to implement in hardware, but we thought it was cheaper if we sacrificed the speed and omit TLB implementation.
After all, Yuichi made an excellent CPU core later, and it installed TLB from the beginning though.</p>
<p>Yuichi completed the overall design of the ISA of our CPU.
He named our CPU GAIA.
In typical CPU experiment projects, we don’t implement interrupt nor MMU.
However, Yuichi started to implement them for Xv6, based on the refactored version of the CPU of Group 3.</p>
<p>I’ll note the weekly records as the rapid progress begins from then on!</p>
<h2 id="1st-week">1st Week</h2>
<p>Instead of just commenting boot sequences out, Masayoshi started implementing actual initialization of our CPU,
and Shohei rewrote the x86 assembly of Xv6 into our homebrew architecture’s.
I added interrupt simulation capability to our simulator which Wataru had made …</p></div></div>

<p>In recent years, democratic governments have had their fair share of troubles. The US presidential election of 2016 was probably one of the most shameful and toxic political events to date, with both Democrats and Republicans verbally abusing each other on social media. In France, the 2017 presidential election saw the fall of the major parties (LR and PS) and the rise of the nationalist party led by Marine Le Pen and a newly-born unaffiliated movement created by Emmanuel Macron: La République en Marche, and, in late 2018, the Yellow Vests protests broke out and outlasted even the protest of May 1968. Many more examples could be cited, such as Brexit, Viktor Orban’s erosion of the rule of law in Hungaria, Jair Bolsonaro’s election in Brazil, the Hong Kong protests, and many more. Worldwide, democracies seem to be crumbling: how can we restore and reassert their legitimacy? We will not be so bold as to declare we have found a silver bullet to the rise of authoritarian regimes, but we will nevertheless try and suggest promising ideas.</p>

<p>First of all, if we are to overhaul the building blocks of our democracies, we must gain fundamental understanding of how politics work. Why do some countries take the authoritarian road while other ones become hosts to governments with free elections?</p>
<h2 id="the-rules-for-rulers">The Rules for Rulers</h2>
<p>The power of a king is not to act but to <strong>get others to act for him</strong>, often through the help of money. In dictatorships, three rules prevail: dictators must get the key supporters - that is, the people who have financial or military power - on their side, and they must control the treasure and buy the key supporters’ loyalty. Then, they have to minimize the number of key supporters, since key supporters needed to gain power are not the same as the ones needed to maintain it.</p>
<p>In democracies, <strong>power is fractured and earned with words</strong>, not violence. Citizens are divided into blocks which politicians can reward as groups. For instance, farming subsidies have no correlation with how much food a country needs, but instead with how much influence farmers have on elections. That’s why populists sometimes manage to garner substantial support despite being disliked by a large part of the population: they cater to a specific subset of the voters which is receptive to their shenanigans. For instance, Donald Trump’s target is mainly the rural, white and low-educated American population.</p>
<p>The main difference between both cases is that <strong>dictators have no need to please the crowds</strong>, especially when the nation’s wealth comes from natural resources (minerals, oil…). On the contrary, <strong>elected representatives need productivity</strong> to increase treasury and therefore to increase the money they can give to their keys, hence they create hospitals, universities… Representatives generally last longer than dictators because their goals are generally more aligned with those of the population. When a dictator is replaced by the people, it is because their keys let the people do so. The people never replace the ruler: the court does. That’s why the following ruler is generally even worse, because they need to keep the keys’ loyalty. In stable democracies, aspiring dictators struggle to gain support because the potential key supporters, more educated, have to weigh the probabilities of making it through the revolt. The more the wealth of a nation comes from the productivity of the citizens, the more the rulers have to redistribute that wealth to the citizens. Democracies typically fall when the treasure becomes empty or when natural resources which dwarf citizen’s productivity are discovered.</p>
<p>Therefore, we will reduce the scope of our reasoning to states which are already democratic, that is most of the Western world. It would be a pipe dream to imagine being able to turn China or Saudi Arabia into a democracy as of today. However, we may reasonably gather ideas which would improve existing democratic systems.</p>
<h2 id="de-mesquitas-principle">De Mesquita’s Principle</h2>
<p>Bruce Bruno de Mesquita offers a very insightful take on politics. According to him, all politicians follow a very basic desire which consists in only two things: to <strong>get hold of power</strong> and to <strong>keep it</strong>. A politician is not “good” or “evil” per se: they will make different choices based on the incentives provided by their environment. From this fundamental principle, many other principles can be deduced:</p>
<ul>
<li>Corollary 1: what a politician really thinks is irrelevant. What matters to them are the other politicians, lobbies and voters they owe.</li>
<li>Corollary 2: merit and responsibility are bad predictors of politics.</li>
<li>Corollary 3: politicians are not stupid. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have won at the game of politics.</li>
<li>Corollary 4: to be “right” is irrelevant in politics. What matters is to get the support of the population.</li>
<li>Corollary 5: it is extremely difficult to introduce new ideas in politics because voters and other politicians will most likely not heed them.</li>
<li>Corollary 6: voters should not vote for ideals or individuals; they should take into account the incentives that will be provided to the different political parties and vote for the political party that will receive the incentives most aligned with their own values.</li>
</ul>
<p>A very natural question follows from those rules: how do politicians attain power? Through <strong>elections</strong>. Let us then examine the current ballot systems of Western democracies.</p>

<h2 id="the-current-distribution-of-voting-systems">The Current Distribution of Voting Systems</h2>
<p>Voting systems can be divided in three main categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plurality systems</strong> are systems in which the candidate(s) with the highest number of votes wins, with no requirement to get a majority of votes, such as the US first-past-the-post ballot.</li>
<li><strong>Majoritarian systems</strong> are systems in which candidates have to receive a majority of the votes to be elected, although in some cases only a plurality is required in the last round of counting if no candidate can achieve a majority, such as instant-runoff voting (Australia) or two-round systems (France).</li>
<li><strong>Proportional systems</strong> are systems in which divisions in an electorate are reflected proportionately in the elected body. Party-list proportional representation is the single most common electoral system for national legislatures, being used by 80 countries, and involves voters voting for a list of candidates proposed by a party.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most common system used for presidential elections around the world is the <strong>two-round system</strong>, being used in 88 countries.</p>

<h2 id="ballot-properties-and-theorems">Ballot Properties and Theorems</h2>
<p>Unbeknownst to most voters, the single most important factor in election results is, in fact, the choice of the ballot. However, it so happens that two of the most used voting systems - the first-past-the-post and two-round systems - are arguably flawed ballots, at least more so than others. Indeed, they are <strong>dependent on irrelevant alternatives</strong>, which is an intuitively bad mathematical property, as opposed to independence from irrelevant alternatives which is defined as such: if one candidate (X) would win an election, and if a new candidate (Y) were added to the ballot, then either X or Y would win the election. Independence from irrelevant alternatives is an intuitively reasonable assumption, but both systems do not have that property. A good example of dependence on irrelevant alternatives is illustrated by this example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After finishing dinner, Sidney Morgenbesser decides to order dessert. The waitress tells him he has two choices: apple pie and blueberry pie. Sidney orders the apple pie. After a few minutes the waitress returns and says that they also have cherry pie at which point Morgenbesser says “In that case I’ll have the blueberry pie.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They are also exposed to the <strong>tactical voting dilemma</strong>: voters support another candidate more strongly than their sincere preference in order to prevent an undesirable outcome. This is partly what happened in the 2017 French presidential election: many voters chose either Mr. Macron or Ms. Le Pen during the first round rather than another candidate which had fewer chances to win.</p>
<p>Mathematicians have in fact devised theorems which put strict boundaries on what we can expect from a ballot:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arrow’s impossibility theorem</strong>: no rank-order electoral system can be designed that always satisfies these three “fairness” criteria:
<ul>
<li>If every voter prefers alternative X over alternative Y, then the group prefers X over Y.</li>
<li>If every voter’s preference between X and Y remains unchanged, then the group’s preference between X and Y will also remain unchanged (even if voters' preferences between other pairs like X and Z, Y and Z, or Z and W change).</li>
<li>There is no “dictator”: no single voter possesses the power to always determine the group’s preference.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, Arrow’s theorem states that when voters have three or more distinct alternatives (options), <strong>no ranked voting electoral system can convert the ranked preferences of individuals into a community-wide (complete and transitive) ranking</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem</strong>: for every voting rule, one of the following three things must hold:</p>
<ul>
<li>The rule is dictatorial, i.e. there exists a distinguished voter who can choose the winner; or</li>
<li>The rule limits the possible outcomes to two alternatives only; or</li>
<li>The rule is <strong>susceptible to tactical voting</strong>: in certain conditions some voter’s sincere ballot may not defend their opinion best.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gibbard’s 1977 theorem</strong> is an extension of the previous theorem when including random strategies. The only voting scheme which satisfies anonymity, unanimity and is strategy-proof is a random dictatorship.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-randomized-condorcet-method">The Randomized Condorcet Method</h2>
<p>Although the aforementioned theorems guarantee that a perfect ballot doesn’t exist, it is possible to build a ballot which exhibits better properties than the first-past-the-post and two-round systems. We will here advocate for the <strong>random…</strong></p></div></article></div>

									Welcome to the second interview on 'The Observer Effect'. We are lucky to have one
									of the most influential founders/CEOs in technology and media - Daniel Ek, Founder
									and CEO of Spotify. This interview was published on 4th October, 2020.

							</em></p><p><em>Daniel does things very differently from other business leaders and was generous to go
								deep with us on his leadership style, time management, decision making, Spotify's impact
								on the world and much, much more. Enjoy!
								</em>
							</p><p><b><a href="https://sriramk.com/">Sriram Krishnan</a></b><br>
								<em><strong>Let’s start with the basics. Walk me through a typical day in the life of
										Daniel Ek.</strong></em>
							</p><p><strong>Daniel Ek</strong><br>
								So, this will sound incredibly lazy compared to some leaders. I wake up at around 6:30
								in the morning and spend some time with my kids and wife. At 7:30, I go work out. At
								8:30, I go for a walk – even in the winter. I’ve found this is often where I do my best
								thinking. At 9:30, I read for thirty minutes to an hour. Sometimes I read the news, but
								you’ll also find an ever-rotating stack of books in my office, next to my bed, on tables
								around the house. Books on history, leadership, biographies. It’s a pretty eclectic mix
								– much like my taste in music. Finally, my “work” day really starts at 10:30.
							</p><p>
								Many people make big decisions early on in the day, I make them later in the day--at
								least later in the day here in Europe. Ironically, it's not actually because I'm more
								productive then, rather because we have so many of our staff in the US, and as a result,
								I've kind of primed myself to work that way.
							</p><p>
								So the earlier part of my day is focused on coaching, one-on-ones, and planning. Then, I
								typically tackle one topic a day which takes a lot of my time. That's my big thing for
								the day. Before we go into a live team discussion on that particular topic, I invest
								time to prepare beforehand – reading and talking to members of the team who are either
								part of the decision-making process or who have insights and context. I sometimes even
								get external perspectives.
							</p><p>
								I also think about what my role is at that meeting. Sometimes I'm the approver. Other
								times, I'm supposed to come with a thoughtful perspective on whether an initiative makes
								sense or not.
							</p><p>
								I’ve found that creating this clarity of role for myself is critical. It’s something I
								challenge my direct reports to think about as they engage with their own teams. I remind
								them that all meetings are not the same. Even when we are meeting to discuss really,
								really complicated topics I always ask myself: “What am I going to do in this meeting?
								What does my involvement really need to be?”
							</p><p>
								The truth is: it's entirely contextual. I find it crucial to be upfront about everyone’s
								role in different meetings, I think this is super, super important. Often that's my
								number one thing: to make sure I know what role I'm playing.</p><p>
								<b><i>Wow, okay, there are multiple things in there ranging from how you choose to spend
										your time to how you handle meetings. To work backwards, what makes a good
										meeting in your mind?
									</i></b></p><p>A great meeting has three key elements: the desired outcome of the meeting is clear ahead
								of time; the various options are clear, ideally ahead of time; and the roles of the
								participants are clear at the time.
							</p><p>
								I often find that meetings lack one of those elements. Sometimes they lack all those,
								which is when you have to say, “This is a horrible meeting, let's end it and regroup so
								it can be more effective for everyone.”
							</p><p>
								To clarify outcomes, options, and roles ahead of time, we sometimes rely upon a preread.
								Prereads are a great way to share context so that attendees can quickly get into the
								meat of the issue and not waste time getting everyone up to speed. What I find is when
								you use a tool like a Google Doc, you can take in a great deal of information by reading
								comments, assessing options, and understanding how opinions have evolved over time. With
								this uniform background and context, attendees can focus on discussing the matter at
								hand versus getting on the same page. When the latter happens, the meeting becomes an
								incredible waste of time.
							</p><p>
								I think that's the single largest source of optimization for a company: the makeup of
								their meetings. To be clear, it's not about fewer meetings because meetings serve a
								purpose. Rather, it’s key to improve the meetings, themselves. A lot of my efforts focus
								on teaching people this framework. Ironically, I find that most people are just
								challenged by that stuff.
							</p><p>
								Candidly, that’s my role as leader: to coach others on how best to make use of their
								limited time. Not only is time the most precious resource the company has, it’s also the
								most precious resource they have! It’s crucial that they approach the use of their time
								with a holistic perspective. By way of example, I had a recent call with one of my
								directors who had not taken a vacation in six months. Our conversation delved into why
								this person thought that they could not be away for two weeks, and me arguing for why
								the person had to take two weeks to recharge!
							</p><p>
								There is never enough time – for work, for family and friends – and it takes work to
								make the best use of it. It's all about fostering a holistic perspective in life.

							</p><p>
								<b><i>
										That’s fascinating. Let’s turn to your team.

										Your direct reports are highly accomplished people; what are the common mistakes
										you see executives at that level make when it comes to personal time management?
									</i>
							</b></p><div>
							<div><p>
								I don’t think most executives dedicate enough time to thinking. They spend too much time
								in meetings. By the way, I will say as a caveat, I do know people who are incredibly
								organized and succeed with a lot of “do time.” Shishir Mehrotra [Co-founder and CEO of
								Coda] is a great example. If you've seen the docs on how he organizes his time...
								</p><p>

								<b><i>Oh yeah, he has a lot of very well-organized docs! [laughs]</i></b></p></div><p>
								He is a source of inspiration. For a while, I tried to mimic his style because I was so
								impressed with his thinking behind it. But in the end, it just wasn’t for me. It
								actually drove me nuts. <i>[Sriram laughs]</i>
								But I respect him. I would say he's a highly effective executive. His system works for
								him. It's not one size fits all. Some of my direct reports thrive on lots of meetings.
								But, in general, I would say the largest mistake is that they conflate meetings with
								productivity. Often fewer meetings and better decisions drive the business forward.

							</p>
							<h2 id="opencalendar"><b>On Creating an Open Calendar</b></h2>
							<p>


								<b><i>This dovetails nicely with something that fascinates many of your colleagues: how
										do you have so much open time on your calendar?

										This drastically differs from your typical “successful CEO” who is booked from
										8:30am to 6pm. Walk us through your calendar and how you manage to create this
										open space.
									</i></b>

							</p>

							<p>

								My friends know me well! I do keep a lot of open time. I understand this comes from a
								place of privilege and I’m very lucky to have this flexibility.
							</p>
							<p>

								I feel like synchronous time is very costly; asynchronous time is better. I know there
								are some leaders who prefer to have all executive decisions travel through them. But
								then, you have to wait until the leader has availability to review things. Sometimes you
								run into delays in that process.
							</p>
							<p>
								I typically don't have more than really three or four meetings per day. There are
								exceptions; when I travel, I book in a lot more and I don't keep to my normal schedule.
								That said, most of the time it's three or four meetings a day.

							</p>
							<p>
								My way is to plan long term and do so ahead of time so that people better understand the
								direction in which they're going. You have to be incredibly crisp and clear when doing
								that. For instance, right now we're finalizing our five year plans and long range
								planning. These are actual, real targets fueled by real insights. They are made up of
								lots of super-detailed quarterly and annual goals. I don’t spend much time on the
								quarterly goals and instead focus on our so-called “big rocks.”
							</p>


							<h2 id="bets"><b>On Company Bets</b></h2>
							<p>
								At Spotify, we have something called “Company Bets.” These are large-scale initiatives
								that we believe will have a significant impact on the business within a relatively short
								period of time. I find that these bets are a much better use of my time. Our Company
								Bets typically update every six months, so I'm not needed that much in between. This
								way, I can constantly be thinking: “Where are we headed in the next six months?” Right
								now, I am thinking more about H2 2021. From a timeline perspective, that's the earliest
								place where I focus most of my time.
							</p>
							<p>
								It’s also my role to think far beyond that. For instance, I’m immersing myself in our
								2025 plans. I trust my team to manage the day-to-day, shorter-term initiatives and
								iterate as needed based on data and insights. They’re the best at that and I appreciate
								that this then frees me up to think about the long term.
							</p>

October 4, 2020 | https://alastairreid.github.io/a-year-of-papers/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://alastairreid.github.io/a-year-of-papers/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>This is an overview of <a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/papers">the papers that I have read over the last 12 months</a>
since I <a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/joining-google/">joined Google Research</a>.
Over the last year, I have read 122 papers and I have added 364 to my paper
backlog.
You can read <a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork">my summaries of all the papers</a>,
read <a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/notes">notes on common themes in the papers</a>,
and download <a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/RelatedWork.bib">BibTeX</a> for all the papers.
As the number of papers grew, I reorganized several times and
<a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork">the site</a> became a bit like a <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/zettelkasten-improves-thinking-writing">Zettelkasten</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-i-organize-my-notes-about-papers">How I organize my notes about papers</h2>

<p>I started the year by trying to define a few topics that the papers I read
would fit into and trying to maintain overviews of each topic that linked to
each paper.  This is how I used to organize papers in filing boxes, filing
cabinets, stacks on my desk, etc. but it doesn’t work very well.  The most
obvious reason that it doesn’t work is that some papers span multiple research
topics so, whichever topic I assign them to, it will be wrong.
More seriously though, I am often reading because I don’t understand the field so
how can I possibly know how to organize papers when I first start
reading.
I also found that I was not updating the overviews because each time I read
a paper, I would need to restructure the overview to accomodate what I had just
learned.</p>

<p>After a few months, the original system was starting to fail, and I learned
about the <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/zettelkasten-improves-thinking-writing">ZettelKasten</a> method of making
notes about papers and concepts. I have not fully adopted this method
but I have adopted some of the ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If a paper introduces an important looking concept, I create a new
page in my <a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/notes">notes</a> and link the paper to the note.
This avoids duplication of the information and, by adding links to
all the referring pages, it makes it easy to find all the papers
related to the concept.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I vigorously add links between papers and notes: going back to previously
read papers and adding links when I add a new concept.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rely on the links to define the structure of the site.
That is, I allow topics to emerge and evolve organically as I read
papers instead of trying to impose structure on a topic before
I even understand it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The main way that my approach differs from <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/zettelkasten-improves-thinking-writing">ZettelKasten</a> is that
a true ZettelKasten would create notes for every concept whereas
I tend to create notes only if I think multiple papers will link
to the concept.
I should probably follow the ZettelKasten approach more closely
and move a lot of the information I currently put in paper summaries
into notes about concepts.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-read">What I read</h2>

<p>Over the last year, I have mostly been reading about software verification
and security including
<a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/notes/information-flow/">Information flow control</a>,
<a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/topics/os/">Operating Systems</a>,
<a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/topics/tools/">Verification tools</a>,
<a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/notes/separation-logic/">Separation logic</a> (and, more generally, <a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/notes/permission-logic/">permission logic</a>),
<a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/notes/rust-language/">The Rust language</a>,
<a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/notes/fuzz-testing/">Fuzz testing</a>,

<a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/notes/property-based-testing/">Property-based testing</a>,
<a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/notes/test-generation/">Test generation</a>,
and
<a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/notes/google/">Google</a>
(in, more or less, chronological order).</p>

<p>Each paper links to my summary of the paper.
A few caveats about my summaries:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Paper summaries are written fairly quickly, in a single pass, with little/no revision.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notes about concepts are always in a state of flux and often contain ‘todo’ comments
about how they should be restructured when I find the time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Especially when I am reading about a new topic, the summaries will contain errors
because I don’t understand that topic well enough to write a good summary.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the summaries are mostly intended to help my understanding they may skip explaining
concepts that I already understand well.
Reading other papers in the same topic may help, or it may not.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The summaries are not a substitute for reading the paper yourself and forming your own
understanding and opinion.
I encourage you to write your own paper summaries and maybe only use my list as one
source of ideas of what to read.</p>

<p>It’s been brought to the attention of many people in the game development industry that you can use fibers to parallelize your engines and games. This one presentation in particular:
  <a href="http://twvideo01.ubm-us.net/o1/vault/gdc2015/presentations/Gyrling_Christian_Parallelizing_The_Naughty.pdf">Parallelizing the Naughty Dog engine using fibers</a> has been a talking point since it came out in 2015. However, it doesn’t quite go into the details enough to really explain why fibers are a good fit or how to actually implement them. In my pursuit to educate myself and take a stab at implementing them, I’ve concluded that there’s a distinctive lack of good information online. In response to the lack of literature on this topic, I’ve decided to explain it from multiple angles, and provide less known information on the subject. This document serves as a
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sourcebook">Sourcebook</a> for those who really want to determine if it’s a right fit for them and how to go about actually doing it.</p>
<h2 id="disambiguation-of-terms">
  Disambiguation of terms.
  <a href="#disambiguation-of-terms">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Before we get started I want to define three distinctive terms.</p>
<ul>
<li>OS-thread (the thread given to us by the OS)</li>
<li>Hardware-thread (the actual physical thread on a CPU)</li>
<li>Fiber-thread (the thread of execution that is our fiber)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-fibers">
  What are fibers?
  <a href="#what-are-fibers">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Fibers are a lightweight thread of execution similar to OS threads. However, unlike OS threads, they’re cooperatively scheduled as opposed to preemptively scheduled. What this means in plain English is that fibers <em>yield</em> themselves to allow another fiber to run. You may have used something similar to this in your programming language of choice where it’s typically called a <em>coroutine</em>, there’s no real distinction between coroutines and fibers other than that coroutines are usually a language-level construct, while fibers tend to be a systems-level concept.</p>
<p>Other names for fibers you may have heard before include:</p>
<ul>
<li>green threads</li>
<li>user-space threads</li>
<li>coroutines</li>
<li>tasklets</li>
<li>microthreads</li>
</ul>
<p>There are very few and minor differences between fibers and the above list. For the purposes of this document, we should consider them equivalent as the distinctions don’t quite matter.</p>
<h2 id="scheduling">
  Scheduling
  <a href="#scheduling">#</a>
</h2>
<p>At any given moment the OS is running multiple processes all with their own OS threads. All of those OS threads need to be making forward progress. There’s two classes of thought when it comes to how you solve this problem.</p>
<ul>
<li>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_multitasking">Cooperative scheduling</a></li>
<li>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preemption_%28computing%29">Preemptive scheduling</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s important to note that while you may observe that all processes and OS threads are running in parallel, scheduling is really providing the <em>illusion</em> of that. Not all threads are running in parallel, the scheduler is just switching between them quickly enough that it appears everything is running in parallel. That is they’re <em>concurrent</em>. Threads start, run, and complete in an <em>interleaved</em> fashion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is possible for multiple OS threads to be running in parallel with
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_multiprocessing">symmetric multiprocessing</a> (SMP) where they’re mapped to multiple hardware threads, but only as many hardware threads as the CPU physically has.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="premptive-scheduling">
  Premptive scheduling
  <a href="#premptive-scheduling">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Most people familiar with threads know that you don’t have to <strong>yield</strong> to other threads to allow them to run. This is because most operating systems (OS) schedule threads <strong>preemptively</strong>.</p>
<p>The points at which the OS may decide to preempt a thread include:</p>
<ul>
<li>IO</li>

<li>interrupts (hardware events mostly)</li>
</ul>
<p>The first three in particular are often expressed by an application as a
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_call">system call</a>. These system calls cause the CPU to cease executing the current code and execute the OS’s code registered for that system call. This allows the OS to service the request then resume execution of your application’s calling thread, or another thread entierly.</p>
<p>This is possible because the OS will decide at one of the points listed above to save all the relevant state of that thread then resume some other thread, the idea being that when this thread can run again, the OS can reinstate that thread and continue executing it like nothing ever happened. These transition points where the OS switches a thread are called
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_switch">context switches</a>.</p>
<p>There’s a cost associated with this context switching and all modern operating systems have made great deals of effort to reduce this cost as much as possible. Unfortunately, that overhead begins to show itself when you have <em>a lot</em> of threads. In addition, recent cache

  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarchitectural_Data_Sampling">Microarchitectural Data Sampling</a> on modern processors has led to a series of both user-space and kernel-space mitigation strategies, some of which increased the overhead of context switches significantly.</p>

  Cooperative scheduling
  <a href="#cooperative-scheduling">#</a>

<p>This idea of fibers yielding to each other is what is known as cooperative scheduling. Fibers effectively move the idea of context switching from kernel-space to user-space and then make those switches a fundamental part of computation, that is, they’re a deliberate and explicitly done thing, by the fibers themselves. The benefit of this is that a lot of the previously mentioned overhead can be entierly eliminated while still permitting an excess count of threads of execution, just in the form of these fibers now.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-multi-threading">
  The problem with multi-threading
  <a href="#the-problem-with-multi-threading">#</a>
</h2>
<p>There’s many problems related to multi-threading, most obviously that it’s difficult to get right. Most proponents of fibers make false claims about how this problem goes away when you use fibers because you don’t have parallel threads of execution. Instead, you have these cooperatively scheduled fibers which yield to each other. This means it’s not possible to
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition">race data</a>,
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock">dead lock</a>,
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock#Livelock">live lock</a>, etc. While this statement is true when you look at fibers as a N:1 proposition, the story is entierly different when you introduce M:N.</p>
<h3 id="n1-and-what-it-means">
  N:1 and what it means
  <a href="#n1-and-what-it-means">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Most documentation, libraries, and tutorials on fibers are almost exclusively based around using a single thread given to you by the OS, then sharing it among multiple fibers that cooperatively yield and run all your asynchronous code. This is called N:1 (“N to one”). <code>N</code> fibers to <code>1</code> thread, and it’s the most prevalent form of fibers. This is how Lua coroutines work, how Javascript’s and Python’s async/await work, and it’s <strong>not what you’re interested in</strong> doing if you actually want to take advantage of hardware threads. What you’re interested in is M:N, (“M to N”) <code>M</code> fibers to <code>N</code> threads.</p>
<h3 id="mn-and-what-it-means">
  M:N and what it means
  <a href="#mn-and-what-it-means">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The idea behind M:N is to take the model given to us by N:1 and map it to multiple actual OS threads. Just like we’re familiar to the concept of thread pools where we execute tasks, here we have a pool of threads where we execute fibers and those fibers get to yield more of themselves on that thread.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I should stress that M:N fibers have all the usual problems of multi-threading. You still need to syncronize access to resources shared between multiple fibers because there’s still multiple threads.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-thread-pools">
  The problem with thread pools
  <a href="#the-problem-with-thread-pools">#</a>
</h2>
<p>A lot of you may be wondering how this is different from traditional task based parallelism choices seen in many game engines and applications. The model where you have a fixed-size pool of threads you queue tasks on to be executed at some point in the future by one of those threads.</p>
<h3 id="locality-of-reference">
  Locality of reference
  <a href="#locality-of-reference">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The first problem is <em>locality of reference</em>. The data-oriented / cache-aware programmers reading this will have to mind my overloading of that phrase because what I’m really talking about is the resources that a job needs access to are usually local. The job isn’t going to be executed immediately, but rather when the thread pool has a chance to. Any resource that job needs access to, needs to be available for the job at some point in the future. This means local values need their lifetime’s extended for an undefined amount of time.</p>
<p>There’s many ways to solve this lifetime problem, except they all have overhead. Consider this trivial example where I want to asynchronously upload a local file to a webserver</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>upload_file</span>(<span>const</span> String<span>&amp;</span> filename) {
  thread_pool<span>-&gt;</span>add_job([<span>&amp;</span>] {
    <span>auto</span> file <span>=</span> open_file(filename);
    <span>auto</span> data <span>=</span> read_file(file);
    post_binary_data(data);
  });
}
</code></pre></div><p>Do you see the bug?</p>
<p>The issue is that the string passed to <code>upload_file</code>, i.e the local <code>filename</code>, only has a lifetime of the body of the function. When this function returns, <code>filename</code> no longer is a valid string. However, at some point this lambda function will be executed and try to access <code>filename</code> in it’s local context and it’ll be a dangling reference by then.</p>
<p>This can be surprsing to those more familiar with dynamic languages, since they support this functionality with something called a closure. The closure will actually extend the lifetime of <code>filename</code>. In native languages like C or C++ though, this isn’t the case and all lifetime extension needs to be done explicitly with obvious runtime which introduces overhead.</p>
<p>What you could do is <strong>copy</strong> the string. The copy will then have the lifetime of the lambda. However, if we had a much larger resource to share with this job that couldn’t be as cheaply copied, we would have to use something like a <strong>reference count</strong> instead. As you can see, the solutions to the resource problem involve a great deal of overhead in many cases and requires you to really think and reason about lifetimes here when you didn’t have to, nor should you have to.</p>
<p>We’re experiencing a lot of friction here already and it’s only a few lines of code. My personal rule of thumb is if you find yourself experiencing friction like this, it’s usually indicative of bad design and the problem needs to be rethought.</p>
<h3 id="nested-induced-deadlocks">
  Nested induced deadlocks
  <a href="#nested-induced-deadlocks">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The other significant problem with thread pools is what I call <em>nested induced deadlocks</em>. No matter how you slice and dice it, jobs are going to want to schedule other jobs and need the result before they themselves can continue.</p>
<p>Let me set up a real world example because it’s easier to …</p></article></div>

            <p>We are happy to announce LibrePCB 0.1.5 with several long awaited new features
in the library-, schematic- and board editors!</p>
<h3 id="highlights">Highlights</h3>
<h4 id="copypaste-in-schematic--and-board-editors">Copy&amp;Paste in Schematic- and Board Editors</h4>
<p>Finally the clipboard functionality cut, copy and paste are available in the
schematic- and board editors
(<a href="https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/724">#724</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/754">#754</a>)! Just use the keyboard
shortcuts Ctrl+X to cut, Ctrl+C to copy and Ctrl+V to paste schematic- or board
items. In the board editor, it’s even possible to paste polygons copied from a
footprint in the library editor.</p>
<h4 id="usability-improvements-in-all-editors">Usability Improvements In All Editors</h4>
<p>This release contains a lot of usability improvements, which makes creating
library elements, schematics and boards much easier. Especially drawing traces
and placing vias was one of the weaknesses of LibrePCB – until now! The tools
to draw traces and place vias have been heavily improved, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traces snap to pads and vias even if they are off the grid</li>
<li>The layer can be switched while drawing a trace, vias are inserted
automatically</li>
<li>Vias automatically take the closest net while placing</li>
<li>Inserted vias are automatically connected to the traces underneath</li>
<li>Trace and via properties can be changed with keyboard shortcuts while drawing
a trace</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://librepcb.org/img/board_editor_draw_trace.gif"><img src="https://librepcb.org/img/board_editor_draw_trace.gif" alt="Draw Trace"></a></p>
<p>Another inconvenience was that the outline of planes and polygons could only
be modified by specifying the exact vertex coordinates. Now this is much easier
since vertices can be moved, inserted and removed graphically right in the
editors.</p>

					<div><h4>Why does online privacy matter?</h4><p><span>Privacy is a means of protecting yourself from exploitation by actors who are using your data in ways that are often not disclosed to you. And this isn’t just at the individual level – we need to think about privacy and its impact on our communities, neighbourhoods and countries.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>One of the things that should matter to us is thinking about what kind of behaviours does data collection at this scale encourage, what kind of societies does this create? What information is being served to us that shapes how we conceive of the world around us? How have we been living under the guise of democracy since so much power has been amassed under Facebook and Google, for example? Can we really call that democracy? Or is this a techno-authoritarian state-of-being that we’re living through?</span></p><h4><b>What do you think are the biggest risks to online data privacy at the moment?&nbsp;</b></h4><p><span>I think our understanding of data privacy at a general level is quite one dimensional. I don’t think that we necessarily have the right tools or education to fully understand. We’re not just talking about what is convenient, we’re talking about people’s ability to access information, about economic rights, about questions around life and death for especially vulnerable populations, many of whom rely on anonymous identities. That’s one of the major risks.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Another risk is the concentration of the means to classify individuals, which is done by a handful of tech giants and data brokers. That’s a determining factor of how you’re treated and what information you’re served. And then thirdly, is the fact that our behaviour and data make up lucrative business models.</span></p><p><span>I don’t think this is just about awareness. Even though The Social Dilemma [a new documentary on Netflix that Amnesty International was involved with] does a great job at creating awareness, it’s not like we weren’t aware that this could happen. Cambridge Analytica happened not too long ago. The Snowden revelations also happened not too long ago. But are you someone who believes that you are fundamentally affected by how your data is surveilled? Does this have a consequence in your everyday life? Those are the questions that will impact how we think about data and tech.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><b>You’ve also spoken about the dangers of surveillance technology – particularly facial recognition software. How do you think the Covid-19 pandemic has shifted the public view on tracking technologies?&nbsp;</b></h4><p><span>Global emergencies are conditions under which states of exception become possible. During the pandemic, we’ve seen a rollout of contact tracing, we’ve seen a rollout of not just facial recognition, but also in some contexts emotion recognition, and really quite diverse forms of biometric identification that we haven’t really seen used at the scale before. Covid-19 has almost created an innovation race for surveillance technologies. However, that crisis element also intersects with our nature to adapt and move on and try to make normal what we can in exceptional circumstances. Before we know it, the invasive measures that were put into place during the pandemic could outlive it. I think the contact tracing debate has opened a lot more discourse around this issue, but it’s not at the same level as the response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal or the Snowden revelations.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We had those great debates. Those debates were never settled. They made us worried, but at some point, we just accepted that some surveillance is ongoing. Things like contact tracing risks significantly stifling our ability to freely move. There are so many things that can go wrong when you’re dealing with a centralised means of controlling people’s movement. The ways in which these technologies can be used are not kept in check. And I think that is one of my biggest grievances around contract tracing and around facial recognition. But we won’t have the kinds of regulatory frameworks that we need as long as there isn’t outrage at the scale that we saw before.</span></p></div>

					<div><h4>Talking about outrage, it was interesting to see the uproar over the A Level results fiasco recently – where else are algorithms being used that we might not be aware of?&nbsp;</h4><p><span>There are many other contexts to think about. The A Levels moment gave some hope to the cynical minds of people like myself who are waiting for people to challenge this notion of deferring human judgment to a machine. Algorithms are often used to quantify unquantifiable things, and where there should really be a more extensive consultative process of figuring out what the truth is and how to best respond.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>There was another example recently in the Netherlands, where a particular algorithm was used to try and predict who was more likely to commit tax fraud and used dual citizenship as a variable. That largely resulted in it finding that people with dual nationality, often ethnic minorities, were committing tax fraud even though there was no evidence to say so. Other examples are predictive policing, which tends to double down on existing prejudice, and welfare assessments, which often come down to indicators designed to encourage reductive decision-making, rather than augmenting the expertise of a caseworker or social worker.&nbsp;</span></p><h4>You recently co-authored a book called <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/digital-witness-9780198836070?cc=gb&amp;lang=en&amp;">Digital Witness</a> about using open source information for human rights investigation and accountability. I wondered what your thoughts are around whether technology leaves people more open to human rights abuses when it comes to the use of their data?&nbsp;</h4><p><span>I don’t think that we can make an unequivocal assertion that technology leaves people open to greater human rights abuses. They do. Of course they do. But they also lead to greater ways for people to contest oppressive power relations and systems that are authoritarian. Contexts in which we’ve used technology to accomplish that includes Amnesty’s reporting on war crimes, human rights atrocities and crimes against humanity. Some of the same technologies that allow for heavy surveillance and the abuse of human rights, also enable the effective pursuit and fight for human rights.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So I do think it’s double edged. I think the way that we shift that dial is by challenging the circumstances under which these technologies exist. Technology should not be operating according to a surveillance business model, which privileges the abuses of human rights over the fight for them.&nbsp; Does the tech industry have to be based on generating an income from our online behaviour and the data that we share, in ways that we don’t always understand? Are we willing to accept that society should be commodified in this way? In lots of ways, this is an exercise in imagining a different world. One we should not shy away from.</span></p><h4>Do big technology companies have a responsibility to be more ethical when it comes to handling our data?&nbsp;</h4><p><span>I think social media platforms tend to rely on the language of ethics to justify their model. Ethics can do a lot to steer the conversation in the right direction and there are incredible digital ethicists, scholars and activists out there doing fantastic work on this. However, my fear is that it can also be a normalising discourse when deployed from within the corporate responsibility side of things, where there is very little accountability.</span></p><p><span>It’s taken for granted, for example, that these asymmetric relations of power are birthed by tech and merely need a tech fix in order to be corrected, which is simply not enough from my perspective. Not only do we need social media platforms to do better when it comes to ethical practice, but at the same time we need stronger and stricter regulation that acknowledges the structural inequities within which the technology industry is embedded.&nbsp;</span></p><p><em>Your data should not be for sale. We’re taking Oracle and Salesforce to court for illegally selling millions of peoples data and we need your help! If you believe that tech giants should be held accountable for their use of people’s data please <span><strong>support our claim by “liking” our support button. </strong></span></em></p><p><em>We’re fighting for change, because your privacy matters.&nbsp;</em></p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24679435">Q&amp;A on Hacker News about this project</a></p>
<p>As we're driving out to our launch site in Leesburg, VA, my wife turns to me and asks, "did you intentionally wear a yellow and blue striped rugby shirt to match your yellow and blue striped rocket?" I look down, and realize that, yes I had indeed accidentally dressed exactly like my rocket. I wonder if that ever happens to Elon?</p>
<h2>Launches</h2>
<p><img src="https://johnjonesfour.com/images/rocket/launch.jpg" alt="Launch images"></p>
<p>Very special thank you to my exceptionally patient wife who tagged along, captured these great pictures, and ended up actually having a lot of fun with her very nerdy husband.</p>
<p>Ida Lee Park in Leesburg, VA allows rocket launches up to 400 feet with a permit, so I applied earlier in September for an October 3rd launch and received fast approval. With the day upon us, my wife and I made the 40 minute drive to Leesburg (apparently in uniform?), set up in our designated part of the park, and got to work.</p>
<h3>Launch 1</h3>
<p><img src="https://johnjonesfour.com/images/rocket/telemetry.gif" alt="Telemetry"></p>
<p><img src="https://johnjonesfour.com/images/rocket/launch1.png" alt="Launch 1"></p>
<p>The first launch was a huge success. The rocket reached 110.3 meters (~362 feet), which beat my simulation's prediction of 90 meters, and it reached a peak velocity of 41.69 meters per second (~93 mph) at 1.44 seconds into the flight. We can see the rocket started to descend very quickly after apogee, and the chute deployed successfully 7.5 seconds into the flight. From there, the chute allowed for a linear rate of descent to a gentle field landing.</p>
<h3>Launch 2</h3>
<p><img src="https://johnjonesfour.com/images/rocket/launch2.png" alt="Launch 2"></p>
<p>Launch 2 was less of a success. While the ascent went smoothly, telemetry was lost 4.57 seconds into flight and the ejection charge ripped the shock cord causing the two rocket components to separate with no parachute to slow their descent. This incident also knocked out the battery cable causing inboard video and data capture to also fail. Unfortunately no video data could be recovered.</p>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p><img src="https://johnjonesfour.com/images/rocket/recovery.jpg" alt="Rocket after launch"></p>
<p>The second launch revealed three major issues that need to be resolved: </p>
<ol>
<li>The shock cord is not strong enough to absorb the force caused by separation, likely because of how heavy the payload is. In a future upgrade I will need to double-up the cords OR use two parachutes for each component to let them descend separately.</li>
<li>When the payload section hit the ground, it drove the coupler way into the body tube. Upon impact, the battery bracket absorbed the force and shattered. However all of the electronics survived. Part of the coupler also broke off when I attempted to pull the it out of the payload section, so this will all need to be redesigned to better absorb hard landings.</li>
<li>There must be a buffer that holds a certain amount of camera footage before saving it to disk. Because the battery disconnected in-flight, no flight video saved. I'd like to figure out how to write video data more frequently in case the battery issue happens again.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to those major issues, I'd also like to make the following improvements:</p>
<ol>
<li>The software performed well, but I'd still like to increase the data capture rate. There are Adafruit libraries for the components I'm using in C++, so I'm considering rewriting <code>air.py</code> in C++, but I'd really love it if someone talked me out of that.</li>
<li>Between launches I manually rebooted the ground computer so that it would clear the visualizations and start logging to a new file. To make this easier, I plan to add the option to the dashboard to start new "capture sessions" without needing to restart the system.</li>
</ol></div></div>]]>

She reiterated the importance of physical distancing, proper hand hygiene and mask-wearing, and attempted to&nbsp;dispel any&nbsp;notion&nbsp;that a vaccine will make life go back to the way it was in a couple of months.</p>  <p>"We can't at this stage just put all of our focus [on a vaccine] in the hopes that this is the silver bullet solution," said Tam.</p>  <p>"We're going to have to manage this pandemic certainly over the next year, but certainly [we are]&nbsp;planning for the longer term of the next two to three years during which the vaccine may play a role but we don't know yet."</p>  <p>Tam said it's unclear at this stage how effective a vaccine will be. She said key questions remain about the degree and duration of immunity a vaccine will provide, the dosage that will be needed&nbsp;and whether it will prevent people from getting infected altogether or simply prevent severe illness requiring hospitalization.</p>  <h2>More than 150&nbsp;under development</h2>  <p>There are <a href="https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/coronavirusvaccinetracker/">more than 166 vaccines</a> at various stages of <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaccine-clinical-trials-1.5580436">preclinical and clinical (human) testing</a>&nbsp;across the globe right now, the World Health Organization says. <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/us-azar-vaccine-global-supply-1.5571264">U.S.</a> and <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/coronavirus-vaccine-1.5569165">European</a> experts say under an optimistic scenario, the first of those vaccines could complete testing and get approval for distribution next year.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Tam warned that even once a vaccine is tested and deemed to be both safe and effective, there will be challenges with distributing it widely to those who need it.</p>  <p>"It's likely that there won't be enough vaccines for the population," said Tam. "So there'll be prioritization and we're looking at that."</p>  <p>Tam said she agreed with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the&nbsp;top infectious disease specialist in the U.S., who told Congress last week that he was "cautiously optimistic" that a safe and effective vaccine will be available by the end of the year.</p>  <p>Despite that, she said&nbsp;public health officials are planning for a scenario in which measures that have been put in place thus far, including physical distancing to limiting crowd sizes,&nbsp;could be required even after a vaccine is found.</p>  <p>"[A vaccine] is one important layer of protection," said Tam. "It is a very important solution if we get a safe and effective vaccine,&nbsp;but I would say that the public health measures that we have in place&nbsp;— the sort of personal, daily measures that we take — is going to have to continue."</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH: Tam on&nbsp;how Canadians should psychologically prepare for the future:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><div><div role="button" tabindex="0" title="Tam questioned about how Canadians should psychologically prepare for the future"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/385/450/ftr%20TAM%20looking%20forward_frame_167.jpg" alt=""></p></div></div></div><span>Canada's chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam spoke with reporters, including the CBC's Tom Parry on Parliament Hill Tuesday.<!-- --> <!-- -->2:19</span></span></span></p>  <h2>Recommends masks for children over 10</h2>  <p>Tam said one of the busiest areas of planning for officials&nbsp;is the reopening of schools in September, for which,&nbsp;she said, the Public Health Agency of Canada will be publishing detailed guidelines later this week.</p>  <p>The guidelines will include a recommendation that children over the age of 10 be required to wear masks, said Tam, in French. Extra consideration should be given for children under the age of 10, she said.</p>  <p>"The recommendations will undergo evolution as the evidence changes and we'll also have to see what happens as we understand transmission in different age groups&nbsp;and what happens in schools." said Tam. "We may have to adapt this recommendation as we go along."</p>    <p>Tam also addressed criticism of another layer of protection the federal government rolled out last week&nbsp;— the COVID Alert exposure notification app&nbsp;— which is meant to tell users if their phones have recently been close to a phone registered to someone who volunteers that they've tested positive for the coronavirus.</p>  <p>The app&nbsp;works only on phones released in the last five years or so because it needs a relatively recent operating system.</p>  <p><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/covid-alert-app-accessibility-1.5672881">Critics say that will leave out poorer and older Canadians</a>, who are more likely to use older devices and suffer worse effects from the virus.</p>  <p>Tam said&nbsp;the app is&nbsp;one of many tools available to fight the pandemic, and that people should use them even if they aren't perfect.</p>  <p>"Despite these gaps, we need to have a go at using it," said Tam. "As many people who can download it and use it as possible will make the app more successful."</p>  <p>The government said Monday that more than 1.1 million people had downloaded the app.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

Not more. </p><p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2864034/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2864034/</a></p><blockquote><strong>Working memory storage capacity</strong> is important because cognitive tasks can be completed only with sufficient ability to hold information as it is processed. The ability to repeat information depends on task demands but can be distinguished from a more constant, underlying mechanism: <strong>a central memory store limited to 3 to 5 meaningful items in young adults.</strong> </blockquote><p>For music production this means that you should have at max 4 main elements. </p><p>A typical combination could look like this: </p><ol><li><strong>Rhythm:</strong> Kick + Percussion</li><li><strong>Lead:</strong> Vox/Synth/etc.</li><li><strong>Melody:</strong> Bass/Pads/etc.</li></ol><p>Many times a track will have more elements, but the idea is to understand which sounds are the most important ones.</p><p>It's a good rule of thumb to think about relative importance of elements. Focus most of your time on them.</p><p><strong>Important:</strong> This helps to avoid too many elements competing in similar frequency bands <em>(example: vox; guitar; piano; synth in the same Hz range)</em>.</p><hr><h3 id="-2-a-little-goes-a-long-way">#2 "A Little Goes a Long Way"</h3><p>Listen and trust your ears. </p><p>When making changes in the arrangement, mix, or master it is usually enough to make a small change.</p><blockquote>One of the biggest mistakes people make is that they change too much and it tilts the balance of the entire track. Then you have to rework again. That's why 'a little goes a long way'.</blockquote><hr><h3 id="-3-an-instrument-is-a-combination-of-many-sounds">#3 An Instrument Is a Combination of Many Sounds</h3><blockquote>Many people think that an instrument is only composed of a single sound, but <strong>that's an illusion</strong>. Think of a guitar, it is a combination of the following sounds: the pick hitting the string, the hand grabbing the frets, the vibration of the string, the vibration of the guitar's body, and so much more.</blockquote><p>Once you understand the various frequency ranges at which each instrument works you can start to play with those to create the desired sound.</p><p>A great primer for this concept is the video below:</p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wx_kugSemfY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><hr><h3 id="-4-something-for-the-hip-and-something-for-the-head">#4 "Something for the Hip and Something for the Head"</h3><p>You can think about music in two basic layers: </p><ol><li><strong>[</strong>Foundation<strong>] Something for the Hip:</strong> A groove and rhythm that makes you want to dance and shake your booty. Usually it is the kick drum, the percussive elements and the bass sounds. </li><li><strong>[</strong>Embellishment<strong>] Something for the Head:</strong> Melodic elements that make your head pay attention.

It's almost like pulling the listener's attention by its hand and '<em>dragging them into the mix'</em>.</p><p>A great example of that technique is the following statement by producer Maya Jane Coles from her <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/features/3558">Resident Advisor interview</a>: </p><blockquote>I often layer multiple different sounds that cover four frequency ranges, especially with bass. There'll be a very filtered low, low sub below 100 Hz that sounds very muted, then the more solid, mono mid-range sound. If I'm creating a wobble bassline, then I'll make the cutoff frequency of the filter vary to create some movement. On top of that I'll have a more high-frequency, low-cut bass sound, and I'll filter that in and out throughout the whole track. <strong>I'll record the automation from start to finish so that there's never a static part and it's always changing a little bit.</strong><p>That's especially important when the track revolves around a bassline, as with a lot of Nocturnal Sunshine stuff. I'll try and make sure that there's never eight bars where the bass is all flat and the movement is the same. Say automation is controlling the filter of one of the layered parts of the bass. <strong>Even if all the other three layered parts stay the same, it creates movement within that sound.</strong> A listener wouldn't necessarily know that that sound's created with three or four layers. It just gives it a slightly fuller sound with the movement.</p></blockquote><hr><h3 id="-3-mixing-depends-on-context">#3 Mixing Depends on Context</h3><p>The world is changing, and so are the expectations to what music should sound like. </p><p><em>(This is an entire rabbit hole in itself and I can recommend "<strong>How Music Works</strong>" by David Byrne [<a href="https://amzn.to/2GkJAkU">affiliate link</a>] where he discusses this at length)</em></p><p>One of the first feedbacks I received from Kilian was the following:</p><blockquote>Your tracks are very beautiful and nicely arranged. The one thing that I noticed was that the mix was very symphonic - meaning it had a very large dynamic range. <p>Usually this happens when people listen to a lot of organically produced music - like classic - and when they mix on headphones.</p></blockquote><p>Both was true.</p><blockquote>If the context of the music would be to have these tracks only as silent background for a movie it would work, but if you want the tracks to work in a club setting then we need to make some adjustments. <p><strong>Modern music has an unnatural amount of <a href="https://www.artlapinsch.com/hearing-protection/">sound pressure</a></strong> - particularly in the lower frequencies. </p><p>On top, there is a loudness war, every producer wants her tracks to be as loud as the references from beatport. </p><p>The reference tracks on beatport are compressed to death and therefore are consistently loud - on headphones and most importantly in the club.</p></blockquote><p>Since my goal was to have tracks that could be played in a club/festival setting we needed to do some extra work.</p><hr><h3 id="-4-sequential-sidechain-compression">#4 Sequential Sidechain Compression</h3><p><a href="https://blog.liveschool.net/breakdown-kaytranada-crafts-beats/">Many producers use sidechain compression</a> to give more space for their kick drum. </p><p><u>Example:</u> Kick drum hits and triggers a sidechained compression of another element <em>(in most cases a sub-bass or a synth)</em>.</p><p>But... it gets interesting once you start using sidechain compressions on multiple mix groups in similar frequency bands.</p><p>Let's assume you have vox, …</p></div></div>

<h2 id="to-the-reader">To the reader</h2>

<p>
	   This little book is in Basic English. It is a first attempt to put some  chief parts of the science which has rightly been named ' the key to knowledge  ' into the new language which is becoming month by month the international  language of the Earth. For those who have no knowledge of Basic, a list of  books about it has been printed on the last page. The rules for working the 850  words here used (all of which are printed at the front, on one side of a bit of  business notepaper) are given in <i>Basic English</i> and in the <i>ABC</i> ;  and the different forms and uses of the words themselves are made clear in <i>The  Basic Words.</i> </p>
<p><br>
    As to my experience in using this language ; I am not conscious  that at any point I have said anything which is in any way different from what  I had in mind to say, or that I have been forced to say it in a way which is  less clear, or less in harmony with my purpose than the other ways which would,  with a longer Word List, have been open to me. In fact, very frequently the  opposite has been true ; the simple language has been better for this sort of  work than a more complex language. About half of the book is an account of  views with which everyone who has any experience with these questions will be  in agreement. The other half is only a statement of my opinions about points on  which agreement is unhappily not possible in the present conditions of  knowledge. But when what is said is wrong, the error is to my thought, not in  the language, and may be put right without the use of more or different words. </p>
<p><br>
   For suggestions on points of detail in the writing I am in debt to  Miss Lockhart of the Orthological Institute. <br>

<h2 id="language-machine">Langage Machine</h2>
<div><p><i> An idea in the mind is to a Natural Law as the power of seeing is to  light.</i>  S. T. Coleridge, on  Shakespeare's use of language.</p><p>
     
    The purpose of this book is to give a clear account of how we may  best put our thought in order, of if we are not able quite to do this, how we  may best make a serious attempt in this direction. To put our thoughts in order  is to make them come into agreement with things, to make them give us a truer  picture, a representative map or instrument for guiding our acts, so that men  may give effect to as great a number of their desires as possible. The name of  the general theory of how to do this is ' Logic '. As Bentham said, ' Logic is  the art which has for its end (or purpose) the giving, in the best way,  direction to the mind '. This direction is chiefly a power of keeping the divisions  between our thoughts in the right places, and the right places are only the  places in which, for the purpose in view, we have a need to put them, and the  places in which other for their purposes have put them. </p></div>
<div><p>
    Another very great authority -- Charles Saunders Pierce -- gave  as his account of Logic : that it is the theory of good behaviour in thought,  in the sense in which good behaviour is the use of self-control for the purpose  of making our desires come about. (His words were, "Logic is the ethics of  thinking, in the sense in which ethics is the bringing to bear of self control  for the purpose of realizing our desires.") Because we are only able to  put and keep our thoughts in control by the help of language, and because of  control of language, for this purpose, is the control of the senses of our  words, a great part of Logic, as Bentham and Pierce saw it, becomes the theory  and right use of the senses of our chief words -- those upon which the ordering  of the senses of our other words is dependent. The senses of these chief words  -- and their ways of working with or against one another -- are the rules of  reason There are not (1) the sense and (2) rules for putting them together ;  but the senses themselves give us, in their ways of acting, the rules of  reason. </p><p>
    
    p. 10 . . . . . . (more) . . . for 11 pages . . . </p><p>
    
    After these first pages about the purpose and need of a better  apparatus for controlling the senses of our words, we may go on freely to the  necessary work.</p></div>

<h2 id="theory-of-knowledge">Theory of Knowledge</h2>
<p>   Let us take the most important word, in the theory of the comparison of  senses and in the work of taking statements to bits for the purpose of  comparison, and make lists of their chief senses. We will give numbers to these  senses, so that we may put a finger on them, without trouble, when in the  process of discussion it becomes necessary to give them separate attention. We  will be able to see -- together and on one page -- the chief senses which may  be coming into use at this point in the discussion. We will then see not only  which tricks and twists we will have to keep in mind, but -- and this is more  important -- the other possible theories. </p>
<p>
    The first reaction of most readers to number (12-112, 3-24 and so  on) in pages put before them is normally fear mixed with disgust. It is hoped,  however, that here the great help which such numbering gives in keeping  different things separate will make you more kind to them. Without them I would  be forced to make the discussion at least three times longer, and to say the  same thing even more frequently than I do. A numbered list at the end of the  book in which lists of all the senses of the key-words are printed together in  their numbered order will make the necessary looking forward and back as little  trouble as possible. These numbers are only names for the sense, names which  make their positions in relation to one another clear to the eye. A number like  5-12 makes us see that the sense it is a name of is a division of sense 5-1 ;  9-211 and 9-212 are different divisions or special forms of 9-21 and so on.</p>
<p> <br>
    I give in my account only some of the reasons for making the  divisions where I do. The apparatus is a machine for separating the senses of  other words when it is necessary to do so. The test of the value of our  divisions is the amount of help they give us. It is important to keep in view  this fact that we are not here putting on paper something which is given to us,  so much as making a machine -- a machine for controlling thought which will let  us do some things and keep us from doing other things. It is a good machine if  it is of use to us ; any changes which will make it of more use to us will make  it better. They are not able to be tested in any other way than this. If the  reader is troubled by this word <i>use</i> here, a look at <i>necessary,</i> sense 17-12, in the list at the end of the book, may make the point clearer. </p>
<p>
    On the other hand, if it is to be of use, it is necessary to keep  some of the divisions in the places in which our minds normally put them. The  attempt to make a machine like this is, in fact, a way (and the best way) to  the discovery of how our minds do their work. But, as we will see, our minds do  their work in a number of different ways. They put the chief divisions, upon  which all the other are dependent, in a number of different places for  different purposes. </p>
<p>So a number of different machines are possible and  necessary. Very little of the theory of the connections between these possible  machines has been worked out. The history of thought is still waiting for such  a theory. The experts have had enough to do putting their machines together or  attacking the machines of other experts. They have not made the right sort of  comparisons, and their machines have not been put together for this purpose.  This sad condition of our theories will seem very strange in the future,  because the work is important. The histories of different nations make their  ways of thought different ; and the fact that they are different will, in the  end, be of value to us all. But there is no need for them to be out of all  relation to one another ; as they are now. The machine which is put together in  these pages is for the connection of different systems of thought -- of  different men, nations, governments, sciences, religions, societies -- with one  another. To get things into clear relations to one another we have first to  take them to bits. But the purpose is new knowledge and new buildings, not  destruction. This machine is only one of a number of possible machines ; it  will be tested by the work which it lets us do. </p>

The senses of the words int  he last group, for example, have not quite the wide and free ways of being  different from one another which those in the first group have. A group is a  unit, but senses from all three of them have at times to be kept in view  together. </p>

    With accounts of the chief senses of these key-words before us on  paper in clear lists, the worst troubles of all discussion will in a short time  be seen to give the best chances for new discoveries. they will no longer be,  as they are now causes of unfertile doubt and complex errors. The lists in this  book will at first not be complete and clear enough to give us every sense  which is needed. But even list which are not complete will let us see much  which we do not now naturally see without them. Even a bad attempt will be much  better than no attempt at all. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Building a service registry, a structure that tracks all people, services and
systems that interact with your infrastructure, can be extremely powerful.</p>

<p>If you pick the right format, it can be the glue between totally distinct
toolchains. Placing the registry at the heart of all your other tools means you
no longer need to worry about keeping it up-to-date: the registry defines what
is created, rather than describing it.</p>

<p>By distributing the registry so every developer, infrastructure component or
one-off script can easily read it, you’ll find use cases for this data
everywhere. You can even push this data into systems like your monitoring stack,
allowing automated systems to make decisions on the ownership information it
provides.</p>

<p>As part of a revamp of our infrastructure tooling, we’ve introduced a service
registry into GoCardless. This post explains how we built the registry and some
of the use cases we’ve found for it.</p>



<p>The GoCardless service registry is a <a href="https://jsonnet.org/">Jsonnet</a> library, stored as a
file inside the same Git repository that contains our infrastructure
configuration. Jsonnet, for those not familiar, is an extension to JSON that
aims to support flexible reuse and customisation of data structures.</p>

<p>Jsonnet files evaluate to JSON, and the service registry is no different:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>jsonnet registry.jsonnet
<span>{
  "clusters": [...],
  "services": [...],
  "teams": [...],
  "projects": [...],
  ...,
}
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Perhaps you thought a service registry was a webserver, maybe hooked up to a
database, serving the data via a REST API? That wouldn’t be strange, and there
are many systems that do just that, but I’d suggest the approach of building a
registry out of a single JSON file (compiled from whatever templating language
you choose, be it Jsonnet or otherwise) has several advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>JSON files are so universally compatible that you’ll be able to use this
anywhere</li>
  <li>If you’ve already adopted Git-ops workflows, tracking changes to the registry
in Git should feel very natural</li>
  <li>It’s just data, and your registry is only as good as the data you put in it.
Removing the distraction of building an API means you encourage a focus on
building the right data model, which is what really matters</li>
</ul>

<p>From the output of the <code>jsonnet registry.jsonnet</code> command, you can see we’re
tracking our Kubernetes <code>clusters</code>, any <code>services</code> that we run, organisation
<code>teams</code> who interact with the services, and Google Cloud Platform <code>projects</code>.</p>

<p>You don’t need to start by tracking all these types, but the simplicity of a
Jsonnet library means it costs very little to add a new type. We began with
<code>services</code>, then wanted to ensure no service referenced an invalid team. It was
a natural evolution to add <code>teams</code>, and this pattern has happened many times
over.</p>

<h2 id="service-entry-make-it-rain">Service entry (make-it-rain)</h2>

<p>Our registry began as a list of services, where each service had a
<code>metadata.jsonnet</code> that defined its service entry.</p>

<p>For the purpose of this post, imagine we have a (fake) service called
<code>make-it-rain</code>, which has a service entry that looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Example service called make-it-rain, powering a dashboard of falling</span>
<span>// gold coins whenever anyone takes a payment via GoCardless.</span>

<p>Take a moment to read the Jsonnet- this produces a JSON structure that you can
see <a href="https://gist.github.com/lawrencejones/b209a1a5da864b987cbedb1dffef6116#file-make-it-rain-json">here</a>. It includes a definition of the service and
all its environments, with a list of deployment targets for each environment
that defines where the deployment lives.</p>

<p>There’s some configuration of team permissions and Google Cloud Platform
references- we’ll see how we can use them next.</p>



<p>Once you have a list of service entries like make-it-rain, we can use it
to tightly integrate with all the rest of our infrastructure tools.</p>

<p>Most infrastructure teams deal with many (in my mind, too many) tools.  The
GoCardless team provisions infrastructure with <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">terraform</a>, manages
virtual machines with <a href="https://www.chef.io/products/chef-infra">Chef</a>, and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> resources with
Jsonnet templating. Other teams may use far more.</p>

<p>Thankfully, our service registry is plain ol’ JSON, and easily consumed by all
of these tools. Once imported, we can begin provisioning infrastructure in
response to changes in the registry. This is a change from the registry
describing the infrastructure at a point-in-time, to becoming the definition
what really exists.</p>

<p>When you must update registry to create infrastructure, you guarantee the
registry is up-to-date, and know it can no longer become stale. This allows you
to trust the registry in use-cases that weren’t possible if it could fall
out-of-date, a benefit we’ll see when we integrate it with our
<a href="#tooling">tools</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s see how this works in practice.</p>

<h2 id="kubernetes">Kubernetes</h2>

<p>When someone creates a service like make-it-rain, we’ll import their entry into
the registry. Our CD pipelines will detect a registry change and begin
provisioning core resources required for every service.</p>

<p>First, we have a Jsonnet templated cluster service that we use to create
privileged Kubernetes cluster resources, such as namespaces. As the templating
imports the registry as just another Jsonnet file, it will detect we’re missing
a namespace (<code>make-it-rain</code>) in the <code>compute-staging-brava</code> and
<code>compute-banking</code> clusters, and automatically create them.</p>

<p>After we have a namespace, we’ll create the supporting resources.  Included in
this are resource quotas, limiting the amount of cluster resource make-it-rain
could consume- these limits can be tweaked or overriden in the cluster service
Jsonnet:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// utopia/services/cluster/instances/compute-staging.jsonnet</span>
<span>cluster</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>spaces</span><span>+:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>'make-it-rain'</span><span>+:</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>quota</span><span>+:</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>spec</span><span>+:</span> <span>{</span>
          <span>// These React apps are getting crazy...</span>
          <span>hard</span><span>+:</span> <span>{</span> <span>cpu</span><span>:</span> <span>'32'</span><span>,</span> <span>memory</span><span>:</span> <span>'32Gi'</span> <span>},</span>
        <span>},</span>
      <span>},</span>
    <span>},</span>
  <span>},</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Permissions are one of the more complicated things about managing Kubernetes
clusters. Especially when aiming for a Devops workflow, with application
engineers empowered to care for their own Kubernetes resources, you want to
establish a consistent permission model up-front. Consistency means you can
accurately describe your security stance for audits, and helps maintain
productivity for engineers who work across multiple teams.</p>

<p>Your registry, being the authoritative definition of service RBAC, can be used
to power your Kubernetes RBAC and enforce that consistency. Looking at our
make-it-rain production environment, we can see the RBAC fields:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"type"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Service"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"spec"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"make-it-rain"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"repository"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"gocardless/make-it-rain"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"team"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"banking-integrations"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"environments"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>
      </span><span>{</span><span>
        </span><span>"type"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Environment"</span><span>,</span><span>
        </span><span>"spec"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
          </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"staging"</span><span>,</span><span>
          </span><span>"rbac"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
            </span><span>"admins"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>
              </span><span>"banking-integrations"</span><span>
            </span><span>],</span><span>
            </span><span>"operators"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>
              </span><span>"core-banking"</span><span>
            </span><span>],</span><span>
            </span><span>"viewers"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[]</span><span>
          </span><span>}</span><span>
        </span><span>}</span><span>
      </span><span>},</span><span>
      </span><span>...</span><span>
    </span><span>]</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We made a decision to model just three roles for a service, viewer, operator and
admin- from our experience, it seems this is flexible enough for almost all use
cases. We thought it would be great if all permissions granted to humans were
derived from these member lists, instead of scattering the membership across our
infrastructure configuration (Kubernetes, terraform, Chef).</p>

<p>Now we have our registry, we can do just that. Using Kubernetes permissions as
an example, it’s simple to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Identify the list of teams who are viewers, operators, or admins for any
services that exist within each cluster namespace</li>
  <li>Use these lists to create <code>RoleBinding</code>s in the service namespace, granting
appropriate permissions to each member of the roles</li>
</ul>

<p>We implement this in a single file, <code>cluster/app/spaces-rbac.jsonnet</code>, which
allows us to map over all namespaces in a cluster and provision the
<code>RoleBinding</code> Kubernetes resources. Jsonnet is great for this type of data
manipulation, proving–yet again!–how using a static registry does not limit how
flexibly you can query the data.</p>

<h2 id="google-cloud-platform">Google Cloud Platform</h2>

<p>It’s not just Kubernetes resources in Jsonnet, though. GoCardless is a heavy
user of Google Cloud Platform, and if this permission model is sound, we should
be able to apply it to our Cloud estate too.</p>

<p>For this, we have a …</p></section></div>

			<section><p>In this article we will explore applying the security concept of least privilege to your cloud instances, within a DevOps environment, without adding bulk and delays to your pipeline.</p>
<p>DevOps is not a tool that you buy, or the act of using pipeline software to release your code, it is so much more. Let’s define DevOps, then the three ways, then letâ€™s apply least privilege.</p>
<p><em>Although there are many different definitions of exactly what DevOps is, the most popular definition is from the Phoenix project and the DevOps Handbook. We will follow this definition in this article.</em></p>
<p>DevOps is a way of developing software, as well as a culture within a software development shop, and a mixture of processes and tooling that helps you get there.</p>
<h3>In Order to do DevOps, You Must Follow the Three Ways of DevOps</h3>
<p><em>The first way of DevOps</em> is to emphasize the speed and efficiency of the entire system, instead of just your part. Sometimes this means that you have to help another team do their work, rather than your own, because that will make the entire system so much better. Sometimes this means, asking for help from other teams. Often, automation helps with this, which is why we use a DevOps pipeline software, in order to release and deploy our code quickly and efficiently. Automation generally results in fewer errors, and it almost always results in much faster results. This is the first way of DevOps.</p>
<p><em>The second way of DevOps</em> is fast feedback. This means getting feedback to the correct person or people, in a timely manner. It also means the feedback needs to be accurate, because feedback that is inaccurate is not only unhelpful, it is potentially harmful. We add security testing, and all sorts of other quality tests, to our pipeline software in order to ensure the code that we are creating is high quality, and so that we get very fast feedback. That said, a pipeline is not the only way that you can get feedback, we will talk about this when we apply least privilege.</p>
<p><em>The third way of DevOps</em> is continuous learning. This means setting time aside on a regular basis to improve your daily work. Sometimes this means training. Sometimes this means tuning your tools or doing a proof of concept of several new tools that you are considering ensuring that the one you choose is the absolute best for your specific business needs. Sometimes this means introducing artificial intelligence and machine learning into your systems or tooling, to ensure that it is continuously learning. The point being that you want to be in a constant state of striving for improvement.</p>
<p>Quite often when people think of DevOps, they assume that every single tool or test must go into the pipeline. This is not true. We need to abide by the three ways of DevOps, and that definitely means using pipeline software and putting security tests inside of it, but our work is not done with just that. We cannot possibly complete all of our security requirements within a pipeline.</p>
<h3>Least Privilege and the Three Ways</h3>
<p>Let’s look at how we can implement the concept of <em>least privilege</em> to our cloud processes within a DevOps environment, and how it relates to each of the three ways.</p>
<p>Now we could attempt to put some tests for least privilege in our DevOps pipeline, however, what would we test for? If a permission is included in the pipeline, it’s likely because the software developer assumed that they would need it. What test could we put in a pipeline that would clarify whether or not a permission was actually required? To see if it is in use, or not? This means, it is unlikely we can test for this in our pipeline.</p>
<p>Instead of putting a test in the pipeline, we could set up monitoring in our systems of new processes, to watch which permissions are actually being used and which are not. Whichever permissions are not being used, could be removed, in order to implement<em> least privilege</em>. Now, let’s look at how we can apply this to <em>the three ways</em> of DevOps.</p>
<p>The first of the three ways, to repeat, is speed and efficiency of the entire system. By not putting a tool like this in the pipeline, this would not slow the pipeline down, and that would increase the speed of the system. Instead, we could create automation outside the pipeline, to ensure that this work was done quickly and efficiently, that would obey the first rule for instance, if we had a monitoring tool that did this for us. Letâ€™s take this imaginary monitoring system with us to the next way.</p>
<p>The second way is fast, accurate and timely feedback. Letâ€™s say our automated monitoring system that is watching all of our processes to see which permissions are being used, it gives feedback quickly and to the right people [the security team], that would be a very handy tool. If it could automate removing unused permissions, tell us if someone tries to use a removed permission, and shows us reports of both, that would certainly fit well into the second way. Having it also automate sending alerts and creating tickets would be a cherry on top of all of this; feedback going directly to who needs it.</p>
<p>The third way involves continuous learning. If our automated monitoring system, itself, can learn continuously from the traffic, access, and behavior of our cloud activity and users, then that respects the third way. A system that can train itself, learn when to remove permissions, when to replace permissions, and when to block access, not only respects the third way, it makes for a fantastic least privilege security tool. With enough learning (monitoring), a tool can even start to recommend which access policies would be the best option, given specific situations and previous decisions.</p>
<p>Although many people seem to think that DevOps tools need to go in a pipeline, this article makes it clear that you can still respect the three ways of DevOps and work within DevOps processes, without having your tool in the pipeline. And gain fantastic security results to boot!</p>

    <p>Software development is a craft. We tend to call it “engineering”, but most of
the time, it feels more like plumbing or carpentry. Most of the time, completing
a task does not require any inventiveness. Sometimes we fool ourselves
into thinking that we are more than a craftsmen, engineers even, and in order to
verify our bias, we try to be clever where no inventiveness is required. This
only complicates things, both in the moment and the future.</p>

<p>Because software development is a craft, it is perhaps fair to deduce that
principles which apply to crafts also apply to computer programming. An efficient
workshop is, invariably, a tidy workshop, where every tool has its place.
Consistency is the key to completing tasks at a constant pace. When nothing is
amiss and there are no surprises, it is easy to make plans and execute them. To
keep a tidy workshop, you must <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-CTkbHnpNQ">always be knolling</a>.</p>

<p>An efficient team is, invariably, a team that keeps the code tidy and all
external aspects of it up to date. <em>Always be knolling</em>. This does not directly
contribute to the solution or success of the current task, but the current task
is not your entire job responsibility. In the long run, your job is to complete
tasks consistently and in accordance to specifications. If you’re held up by
ancillary tasks such as upgrading dependencies or unwinding an abstraction that
was meant to solve duplication that turned out to be incidental, then you have
failed to keep a tidy system.</p>

<p>Keeping a tidy system is not only useful to you as a programmer, it is also
useful for team leaders because it helps them to accurately report progress and
estimates to management. Another important aspect is the psychological well-being
of the team. A tidy system is a joy to work on. You do not dread a task because
you know that you are going to have to work on poorly maintained part of the
system or because you’ll have to edit code that offends your sensibilities.
Instead, what you get is the dopamine boost that comes with closing the task in
the issue tracker after you’ve completed it and verified that it works.</p>

<p>A software project is never complete. It can always be extended and changed to
take on new roles and fulfill new design criteria. This is perhaps also true
of physical items such a furniture, but software has more possibilities.
Notably, this is where software development differs from other crafts: it is
more dynamic. This is a an extremely powerful attribute of software. Just
imagine having the possibility of morphing a regular kitchen chair into a
wheelchair or a rocking-chair just by carving an incantation into its seat.</p>

<p>In order to exploit this powerful aspect of software that sets it apart from all
other things, it must be possible to actually make changes to the software. An
untidy system resists change and stands in the way of progress. By constantly
clearing away detritus, we can take advantage of software’s full potential.</p>

<p>Consistency enables change.</p>

Lambda Diagrams are a graphical notation for closed lambda terms,
in which abstractions (lambdas) are represented by horizontal lines,
variables by vertical lines emanating down from their binding lambda,
and applications by horizontal links connecting the leftmost variables.
In the alternative style, applications link the nearest deepest variables,
for a more stylistic, if less uniform, look.
<p>

The following table shows diagrams of identity, the booleans, some standard combinators,
some Church numerals, the predecessor function on Church numerals, and Omega.

<table>

  <td><img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/Omega.gif"></td>
  <td><img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/Omega.alt.gif"></td> </tr>
</tbody></table>
Curiously, the alternative Omega diagram somewhat resembles an (upside-down) Omega.
</p><p>
And here, on a larger scale, is a prime number sieve (alternative style): </p><p>
<img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/primes.alt.gif">
</p><p>
which reduces to an infinite list of booleans that starts out as
</p><p>
<img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/primebits.gif">

</p><h2>Dimensions and complexity</h2>

In terms of pixels, a diagram's width is one less than 4 times the number of variables
(vertical lines),
and its height is one more than twice the maximum number of nested abstractions and applications
(one less for alternaitve diagrams with multiple variables).
<p>
The size of the binary encoding of a term is closely related to
the graphical complexity: it is exactly twice the number of lines
plus the number of (4-way) intersections.

</p><h2>Reduction</h2>

Beta-reduction on lambda diagrams can be shown in several steps, as demonstrated in this reduction
from Y=λf.(λx.x x)(λx.f(x x)) to λf.(λx.f(x x))(λx.f(x x))

<table>
<tbody><tr><td>initial term</td><td><img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/Y.gif"></td></tr>
<tr><td>show application of abstraction</td><td><img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/Y0.gif"></td></tr>
<tr><td>show bound variables and argument</td><td><img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/Y1.gif"></td></tr>
<tr><td>expand function body</td><td><img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/Y2.gif"></td></tr>
<tr><td>to make room for substitution</td><td><img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/Y3.gif"></td></tr>
<tr><td>substitute argument for variables</td><td><img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/Y4.gif"></td></tr>
<tr><td>final term</td><td><img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/Y5.gif"></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

In the third frame, we show only the part of bound variables below abstractions, e.g. when
applying <img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/applied.gif">, the function body x(λy.x) shows as <img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/bound.gif">.

<h2>Diagrams In Motion</h2>

Paul Brauner has produced some awesome <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi8_XqluS5xc7GL-bgVrxpA2Uww6nK0gV">videos</a> of beta reductions, produced with this <a href="https://github.com/polux/lambda-diagrams">software</a>.

<a href="http://dkeenan.com/">Dave Keenan</a> has a comprehensive online paper
<a href="http://dkeenan.com/Lambda/">To Dissect a Mockingbird:
A Graphical Notation for the Lambda Calculus with Animated Reduction</a>,
which partly inspired this page.
<p>
In his <a href="http://bntr.planet.ee/lambda/work/visual_lambda.pdf">Master thesis</a>, Viktor Massalõgin discusses 4 existing graphical notations before introducing his own "bubble" notation. Figure 3 on page 10 shows 4 depictions of the fixpoint combinator (which differs from Y above in one beta reduction), while the bubble form is in Figure 5 on page 13.

        <p>Published on: 2020-10-04</p>
        
<p>Dual licensing with GPL is the idea that if I own a certain piece of GPL code, I can also relicense it as a proprietary library. This is how Oracle licenses Java and how QT licenses QT.</p>
<h2>I - All rights for me but not for thee</h2>
<p>But my general feeling is that there is some stigma associated with this practice, to quote <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#ReleaseUnderGPLAndNF">gnu.org</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To release a nonfree program is always ethically tainted, but legally there is no obstacle to your doing this. If you are the copyright holder for the code, you can release it under various different non-exclusive licenses at various times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "ethically tainted" doesn't resonate with me, I think this licensing model should be encouraged.</p>
<p>I will admit I am kind of biased on this because I work on a for-profit GPL-license project. But it strikes me as silly that this business model is shunned by the open-source community in favor of licensing under MIT/BSD.</p>
<p>Dual licensing is a way in which the "owner" of the code ends up in an advantageous position compared to other users.</p>
<p>That is to say, a user must abide by the strict rules of the GPL license:</p>
<ul>
<li>Release all modifications.</li>
<li>Potentially (depending on the specifics of the GPL license) have to release other projects that are used "in relation" to the library.</li>
<li>Not ship the code under a different license.</li>
</ul>
<p>The "owner" of the code abides by none of these and can thus benefit in ways that the users can't.</p>
<p>In the open-source utopia, where resources are aplenty for everyone, everything is open source and nothing is for sale, so dual-licensing doesn't fit that particular utopia. But we live in the real world, where money makes things a bit more complicated, and in the long term, dual-licensing might be better than equal-rights open licenses.</p>
<p>Well, developers have to eat.</p>
<p>Even worst, good software is made by good developers, developers which can get six-figure salaries designing skinner boxes. On the contingency that those developers aren't ideal altruists, they have to get way-above-subsistence salaries to work on useful open source projects instead of skinner boxes.</p>
<p>So if dual-licensing provides a middle ground for that which is better than the current situation where a lot of good software is proprietary, what's the harm?</p>
<p>Some would say it's a middle ground that will hamper the development of truly free software. But who release said truly free software anyway?</p>
<h2>II - Who release fully-free projects</h2>
<p>When it comes to license like MIT and BSD, that impose no restrictions upon usage, where the "owner" doesn't exist, it's interesting to look at who release projects under those licenses:</p>
<p>a) Students or hobbyists, people creating software for fun, notoriety, and experience.</p>
<p>b) Very large companies (Facebook, Google, Amazon, Uber) or government &amp; donation founded organizations (Universities, Public Research centers, software foundations such as GNU, Apache, and LSF)</p>
<p>The first group is one I don't wish to dismiss, I think a lot of important programs stem from here. But their end goal is not to work for free for their whole life. Usually, they moonlight for their open-source projects and work a paid gig to earn money. A small minority can be funded by donations, but it's a small minority.</p>
<p>The project I use for allowing comments on this website (<a href="https://github.com/umputun/remark42">remark42</a>), has 2.3k stars on GitHub and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/remark42/posts">earns 9$/month from donations</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb">project I work on</a> has 2.9k stars on Github and an operating budget of <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/04/16/mindsdb-raises-3-million-for-open-source-automated-machine-learning/">a few million</a> dollars.</p>
<p>You can certainly get to a point where you are funded by donations, but the reality is that it's not a good enough incentive. Doubly so since the developers working on these projects are usually the "creme de la creme", releasing and maintaining truly useful software usually requires expertise only a small fraction of engineers have.</p>
<p>The second group, the corporation and government-funded teams can only exist because of the scale.</p>
<p>Why can Facebook develop PyTorch?</p>
<ul>
<li>Because Facebook hires so many ML engineers that in the cost-benefit analysis it's cheaper to have your internal framework be popular enough such that you can get already-trained people from day 1. The &lt; 100 people working full time on PyTorch save months of training for every single one of the thousands of ML people facebook hires, since it can hire people that already know PyTorch.</li>
<li>Because Facebook doesn't dominate by having better ML models, it dominates by having thousands of times more data than anyone else. It's in facebook's interest to keep research open since it's objective is not to get ahead, but just to stay even, or at least not fall significantly behind.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why can Nvidia assign engineers to dozens of open source ML and game-engine projects?</p>
<ul>
<li>Because Nvidia makes hundreds of billions each year selling GPUs. The little work they put into those libraries to make sure it works ideally with their GPUs is insignificant to the revenue they get from those markets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why can Google develop TensorFlow?</p>
<ul>
<li>For about the same reasons as Facebook.</li>
<li>Because they can make a lot more money from selling/renting TensorFlow optimized hardware.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that's on the happier side of the spectrum. On the "shadier" end of the scale, one could argue projects like Flutter and Angular might be worth their investment because they make spyware-free browsers like Firefox send-class citizens in the war for the web, not to mention easier integration into internet-monopolizing schemas like AMP.</p>
<p>You've also got, I will admit, projects that seem to be open source purely for flexing. To my knowledge, Yandex might have well never released Clickhouse and the column-store database landscape would have been set back 10+ years for it. Why did they do it? Maybe just because few dozens of people working on it wanted to showcase how good they are.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, this is not a reliable model</p>
<h2>III - Profit motives</h2>
<p>So would it not be nice for open source if one can bring profit motives into the whole thing?</p>
<p>Even better, profit from the people that don't support or contribute to open source, but not from those that do.</p>
<p>It seems to me like double-licensing with GPL achieves just that. One can release a project and charge large companies for using it, at the risk of breaking the license if they don't pay. Even if a lot of them will use the software illegally, as is the case now, the threat of lawsuits will end up deterring some or most heavy-users from doing so.</p>
<p>On the other hand, people using the project in an open-source project of their own have nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>The only problem that remains here is the fact that you can't chain GPL projects. That is to say, one can't use GPL code in their own double-licensed GPL code, but there are workarounds for that (e.g. isolating the GPL dependency and open-sourcing the changes to that alone). Still, this seems like the kind of problem that could be fixed by an off-shoot of the GPL meant for just this use-case.</p>
<p>This model keeps all the advantages of GPL, in that it incentives your users to open-source their product. It doesn't force them to do so, like a purely-GPL licensed software might, but it's not like GPL is working as intended, outside of a few cases where enough money was at stake to sue (e.g. TiVo), violations of the GPL go unpunished.</p>
<p>Currently, a company that wants to include GPL into their project has two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the code in such a way that GPL won't force you to open source the rest of your code.</li>
<li>Use the code and break the license.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the wording of GPL is not that clear, it could often be argued that companies go for alternative nr 2. After all, who will ever know?</p>
<p>But what if the "pay the maintainer a small sum" option was available. Wouldn't the liability afraid giants look towards this much more favorably than either of the other 2 options? Wouldn't this, in the long run, give an edge to open source projects which don't have to worry about these fees ?</p>
<hr>
<p>Thus I think I come in squarely on the side of open-source companies dual-licensing GPL on their product[s]. A model that already exists and often enough has great success (see MariaDB and Aerospike).</p>
<p>It's a nice compromise for moving towards a more open world, without having to live in Stallman's utopia. It's an amazingly pragmatic solution and anyone who reads this blog knows I'm a fan of those.</p>

<p>The NAS is <strong>perfect</strong> because it is simple, safe, modular and extensible and it is <strong>cheap </strong>because it is built of second hand, commodity parts.</p>



<p>The NAS mostly stores files (documents and media) on a software RAID 6 and serves them over Windows shares to the local network. I’m staying away from proprietary NAS solutions because a hardware failure would make data recovery hard to impossible without the exact same hardware replacement. Every piece of hardware,  from the hard disks to the case and motherboard have been switched out for something else in this decade, sometimes more than once, so the focus on modularity paid for itself. Since long-term data integrity and robustness is a concern, the NAS should run some sort of redundant RAID level.</p>



<h2>Goals</h2>

<h2>Non-goals</h2>

<h2>Getting the Hardware</h2>



<p>Getting the right hardware is the hard-(pun)-est part as it is the platform for modularity, price, energy consumption, size and many other goals I’m interested in. There are many second-hand, cheap proprietary NAS servers around, but I don’t like the idea of closed hardware and software systems. Eg, if a hardware RAID controller stores data in a proprietary format on the hard drives I would need the exact same replacement controller to recover that data in case of a controller failure.</p>



<p>Space is also an issue, so the server should be compact while allowing running Linux on it; that is quite hard to find as most compact NAS’ out there are proprietary systems and don’t allow installing your own OS. There are plenty of used x86 PCs and servers, but they are mostly too big or don’t have enough drive bays or SATA ports. Connecting drives over USB is also not an option because of the low speed, higher power consumption and space requirements. The first couple of my NAS revisions around 2010 used a compact barebone and later a mini tower case around which had 3 or 4 hard disk bays, but I find those box formats harder to come by these days. Lucky you if you get one at an affordable price!</p>



<p>I came across a used <a href="https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=emr_na-c03793258">HP proliant microserver</a> gen8 and haven’t regretted it ever since. The base model came with 2GB ECC RAM, a Celeron 2-core CPU and no hard drives for about 100€. There’s an excellent review of that server on <a href="https://louwrentius.com/zfs-performance-on-hp-proliant-microserver-gen8-g1610t.html">Louwrentius</a>. The server is extremely compact (about 26cm each dimension), reasonably low noise (although not silent) in standby, has a passively cooled CPU, two GBit ethernet ports, four 3,5″ hard drive bays and a somewhat hidden proprietary format slot for a fifth low-profile 2,5″ disk which I use for an SSD. The drive bays can directly receive SATA disks while the 5th slot requires a 4 pin FDD male-to-SATA adapter and a SATA cable to connect a 2.5″ SSD to the motherboard, which requires an FDD 4 pin (male)-to-SATA connector. As an added bonus, the server features <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_Integrated_Lights-Out">ILO</a> which allows remote access to the server with a web browser – so no need for a keyboard or screen!</p>



<p>I admit that the server isn’t 100% commodity parts; eg. a motherboard or CPU failure would require ordering the exact same spare parts (which is probably going to be expensive) or building a completely new server on a different platform. However RAM, network and storage are fairly standard, I run Ubuntu on it and the benefits outlined earlier weigh enough to take that risk. About 6 years later the server still runs without any issues; barring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias">survivor bias</a>, I think that approach worked well.</p>



<p>The server I purchased had firmware from 2014 and HP thankfully started publishing updates for free recently, the last one from late 2019 which I flashed the microserver with for a slick HTML5 management UI.</p>



<p>The server underwent various upgrades over the years; from a RAID5 array of three 2TB hard disks to the current setup of 3x6TB + 1x8TB + 1x 512MB SSD and a CPU upgrade to a Xeon model and a RAM upgrade to 16GB ECC. I almost exclusively repurpose external USB hard drives (after opening , extracting the HDD and kissing the warranty goodbye) which are cheaper than internal ones… at first that is surprising considering the extra hardware (case, USB-to-SATA adapter, cables, power supply) they come with; however the warranty and technical specs are significantly inferior to those of internal drives which explains the price difference. Since the server runs a RAID 6 (the entire point of which is to survive disk failures) I think that is an ok risk to take.</p>



<p>The server is connected over an Ethernet cable to the home Wifi router; network speeds are close to 100mb/s which is ok, the USB3 ports can do around 40mb/s.</p>



<h2>Installation</h2>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_Integrated_Lights-Out">ILO </a>makes setting up the server easy even without a physical keyboard and screen. I started with Ubuntu server LTS 14.04, switched over to 16.04 and am currently running 18.04. The upgrades never worked in place, in each case a fresh installation was required. </p>



<p>I recommend installing a VM (like VirtualBox) on your workstation, booting Ubuntu Server 18.04 from a live image and installing Ubuntu on a USB harddisk. I couldn’t get the Proliant microserver to boot with UEFI, so a traditional grub BIOS installation is required. </p>



<p>The four hard disks are partitioned according to the schema below: a 1MB partition at the beginning for the GRUB boot loader, a 50GB partition for Ubuntu and a 5.5TB partition for the RAID.</p>



<p>I used the Ubuntu Server 18.04 alternative installer to set up the Ubuntu partitions as a RAID 1 which mirrors that partition over all hard disks. The installer is able to install Ubuntu into that RAID 1 and GRUB is able to boot from it. In case of a hard disk failure, just removing that hard disk will allow the server to boot again.</p>



<pre><code>+-------------------+
| 1MB bios_grub     |
|                   |
+-------------------+
| 50GB Ubuntu ext4  |
| RAID 1            |
+-------------------+
| 5.5TB Data        |
| RAID 6            |
+-------------------+</code></pre>



<p>For the installer to work, there need to be at least two disks in the RAID. More disks can be <a href="https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Growing">added later</a>. Just make sure to install the GRUB bootloader on all disks with:</p>



<pre><code>grub-install /dev/sdX</code></pre>



<p>In my first experiments Ubuntu was able to boot fine, but wouldn’t activate the ethernet cards. This requires some fiddling with netplan.</p>



<p> <strong>/etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml</strong> </p>


<pre title="">network:
  version: 2
  ethernets:
    eno1:
      dhcp4: true
      dhcp6: true
      optional: true
    eno2:
      dhcp4: true
      dhcp6: true
      optional: true
</pre>


<h2>Boot RAID considerations</h2>



<p>As discussed in “installation”, Ubuntu boots from a RAID 1. md mirrors changes to all boot partitions, which is awesome. The boot RAID is mapped under /dev/md0 – I didn’t find a way to assign a name to it, but I found the device name to be stable. Unfortunately Ubuntu will constantly access the boot drive during normal operation, which in my case means that four drives are always spinning. I tried various things like remapping log directories to a ram disk and pre-loading files, but the resulting jungle of scripts is impossible to maintain. The solution turned out to be quite simple and elegant, after a hack: I installed an SSD in the 5th hard disk bay and added it to the boot RAID 1. While mirroring worked, the Proliant (gen8) BIOS won’t boot from the 5th bay if it finds hard disks somewhere else. The solution is a script which runs after boot and fails all mechanical hard disks in the RAID:</p>



<pre><code>mdadm --manage /dev/md0 --fail /dev/sda2 /dev/sdb2 /dev/sdc2 /dev/sdd2</code></pre>



<p>The script is a bit more complex than that as device names are not stable and various error conditions need to be taken into account (eg. the RAID shouldn’t be touched if a harddisk is failing) – but that is a topic for a different post. MD will forget that the disks have been marked as failed after a reboot, which …</p></div></div>

    <p>RSS: </p> <p><a href="https://reyammer.io/blog/index.xml"><img src="https://reyammer.io/rss.png" width="23px"></a></p>

  <p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/reyammer/status/1311338230139232258" target="_blank">news is out</a>: I left France, I'm no longer a professor at EURECOM, I joined the Malware Research Team at CISCO Talos, and I moved to beautiful Vienna. Big change :-)</p>
<p>I have been a professor for a bit more than three years, but I have had contrasting feelings about the "prof job" for a long time (even before finishing my PhD), it took me a couple of years to realize that I would eventually have needed to move on, and it took even more (mental) effort to actually make the call and leave. Despite being <em>very</em> excited for what's next, oh boy, this was tough :-) But independently of the concrete next step, it was time to move on. Even if Talos realizes the mistake and kicks me out next week, I'm still confident that moving on was the right call.</p>
<p>Especially when it comes to take big decisions, I tend to obsess about trying to stay rational, and I spent years collecting notes on the various pros/cons. Many of these thoughts often started surfacing as "feeling something is not right", without consciously understanding what was going on. But by keep thinking and writing notes down, patterns of thoughts started to emerge and I was eventually able to pinpoint some more defined thoughts on what kept me on the current job and what pushed me to change. Once these reasons were clear, it was much easier to take the decision.</p>
<p>This is a very long blog post, and I don't expect more than a very few people to actually read it. I wrote it mostly for selfish reasons: before changing to a new life, I wanted to wrap up all these notes in something more structured. I can't be certain I took a good decision, but systematizing these thoughts allowed me to move on with enough confidence to know I'm likely making a step forward.</p>
<p>With that being said, I know that someone may be actually interested in hearing these thoughts and my experience. When I was a PhD student and I needed to take the notorious academia vs. industry decision, I would have paid big bucks to read more thoughts on the various pros/cons. One of the stupidest things you can do is to take big decisions based on what other people do and think, but reading about other people's thought process has helped me a lot. It is time I do my part.</p>
<p>The target audience for this post is, other than myself, PhD students / postdocs that are about to decide what to do next and junior profs that somehow feel that "something is wrong". I also expect some senior academics and industry people to read this post, but I guess they will find themselves skipping directly to the academic rant part and mostly agree with much I have to say :-) Anyways, I tried to stay away from the "very known things" (e.g., 👀-level BS when writing proposals, generally "more limited" immediate impact of your work, different compensation level, etc.), and I tried to focus on thoughts I have not seen much discussed around (at least not in this depth).</p>
<p>So, if you feel clueless and you want to hear more from an equivalently clueless random dude on the Internet, here we are :-) If you think this is <em>the</em> blog post that will make everything clear, I have a bad news for you: it's all about tradeoffs and in my opinion there is no clear-cut winner. And, unfortunately, the problem with tradeoffs and balancing many aspects is that figuring out which one to weigh more is yet another very personal decision in its own way. So, you will not find any answer in this post and you will eventually need to figure this thing out on your own, but I hope this will help you forming your own opinion.</p>
<p>This post is organized in three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#part-1-the-good-mdash-what-pushed-me-to-keep-the-job">Part 1: The Good — What pushed me to keep the job</a></li>
<li><a href="#part-2-the-bad-mdash-what-pushed-me-to-leave-the-job">Part 2: The Bad — What pushed me to leave the job</a></li>
<li><a href="#part-3-the-bye-bye-mdash-the-decision-to-leave">Part 3: The Bye Bye — The decision to leave</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

Please feel free to reach out, ping me on twitter, or shoot me an email: I'm of course happy to share more thoughts if you have any question. And if you disagree with something, bring it on!

<br>
<h2 id="part-1-the-good-mdash-what-pushed-me-to-keep-the-job">Part 1: The Good — What pushed me to keep the job</h2>
<p>Before I discuss why I left, I want to touch on what pushed me to keep the job. I want to make sure it's a balanced post despite the upcoming mega rant, so that my overall opinion is more closely reflected. And I really don't want to discourage anyone to take this path, I still think it is a great one.</p>
<p>Note that some of my "reasons to stay" are good, but some are bad. Also note that many of these refer to my personal situation at EURECOM, working in the field of systems security, and not all these points can be generalized to all universities. As they say, your mileage may vary.</p>
<h3 id="its-a-very-good-job">It's a very good job</h3>
<p>The first pros is... 🥁: "it's a very good job". At first, I was shocked to find out that it's an actual job. When I joined this prof thingy I thought that this would be a "job" (note the double quotes). But, while it's true that you don't have a direct boss that tells you what to do, at the end of the day you need to deliver, and you actually work very hard: If your PhD students are in trouble or you teaching sucks, you will run into problems. This doesn't necessarily mean "they kick out", but if you value being a professional (and I do), failing at your core tasks will make you feel bad, even without additional pressure from your superior, and even if you have tenure.</p>
<p>And now that we got this "it's an actual job" out of the way, I can tell you: it's a very good one. There is <em>a lot</em> of freedom in what you do and how you structure your time. Research-wise I felt very free (but you eventually work on what your students like to work on — as it should be), and the department values the right things (I've heard some BS in other schools where, in the context of systems security research, they pressure you to "publish more journal papers..." 🤦‍♂️). I really like teaching and mentoring, and there were many opportunities to do so. They let me create and teach my own class on mobile security, <a href="https://mobisec.reyammer.io/" target="_blank">MOBISEC</a>, and the teaching load is overall very low (1 or 1.5 classes per year). I love playing CTFs and I was even <em>encouraged</em> to spend time and push for NOPS, the EURECOM CTF team (after winning <a href="https://ctftime.org/event/647" target="_blank">HXP CTF 2018</a> and after being referred to as "<a href="https://youtu.be/j0taw78tCYs?t=968" target="_blank">probably a top team</a>" we are mostly enjoying our eternal and well-deserved glory).</p>
<p>The environment is extremely relaxed, informal, and friendly. You are surrounded by top-skilled colleagues and humans, from MS students to profs. I felt in a family from day 1. Last very good point: since in France positions come with tenure, there were not even problems in terms of pre-tenure stress, a real luxury. And on this aspect, EURECOM delivered: I never felt any sort of pressure (but: I did work my ass off... so if you stop doing anything, bad things may happen :-)).</p>
<p>[BTW, EURECOM is frantically trying to replace me, you should apply :-)]</p>
<h3 id="you-are-surrounded-by-students">You are surrounded by students</h3>
<p>When I took my decision to remain in academia, my top reason was for teaching and mentorship. Probably the best perk of the job is that you are surrounded by people eager to learn, from MS to PhD students to postdocs. It is extremely fulfilling and rewarding. Working with my students has been the highlight of my time at EURECOM, from traditional teaching, to suffering through the various rejections, to celebrating defeats of Reviewer #2, to cluelessly getting CTF-close in many stego CTF challenges. I feel very lucky that during these years we found enough interesting ideas that we enjoyed working on together, and that my next job will allow me to keep advising them until they graduate. As a prof, I believe the net output of my work is to see students becoming independent researchers, not the actual papers — I can't wait to see the bright careers I'm sure they will have :-)</p>
<h3 id="i-have-deep-respect-for-the-role-of-profs-in-society-and-it-felt-great-to-be-one">I have deep respect for the role of "profs" in society, and it felt great to be one</h3>
<p>I somehow have a profound admiration for the role that professors have in society and that had in my life. For their hard work, knowledge, passion, patience, and ultimately their service to the community. I'm referring to all teachers and mentors (from elementary schools to universities), who spend their life helping others, while at the same time often being asked to do many useless things and being massively underpaid. I admire and deeply respect these efforts: my most sincere thank you to all past, present, and future profs!</p>
<p>And, to be frank, it felt great to be one. I have been in love with the idea of being a prof for many years. In part, I think it is because some of the people who impacted me the most are professors, and I wanted to do my part in helping others. And after all the uncertainties that one has during a PhD, I think I was even more in love with the idea of having finally found my place in society. [Narrator: LOL, this clueless dude did not find his place. [Answer to narrator: But I've surely found it <em>now</em>!!1!]]</p>
<p>Overcoming all these positive emotions and feelings attached to this job was likely the biggest challenge I faced in coming to terms with the several problems and cons I did have during these three years. As mentioned, I have no intention to give up on this teaching/mentoring thing (taking the time for this long blog post is part of this!), but it will surely not be the same thing. I'm very grateful I had a chance to try this job out. Thanks to all who made it possible, from family to advisors, colleagues, and students ❤️. I owe you big time.</p>
<p>[Of course, being a prof does not necessarily make you a smart or great person. Some profs I know are some of the dumbest people I have ever met (by far) and they would not survive one day in the real world. And some profs I know are the most asshole, selfish, egomaniac, and delusional humans I have ever heard of (Are you pushing your students to stay in the lab …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Imposter syndrome is something that I have been battling with my entire life. Often times I get the feeling that whatever success &nbsp;I have acquired over the years might have just been luck or maybe things worked out because I partnered with the right people who did all the work while I reaped the fruits. </p><p>This feeling started all the way back in school when I scored the highest marks in an exam which everybody else struggled with. </p><p>At the time I was convinced that the only reason this happened was because I was lucky enough to have studied that one question in the syllabus which nobody thought would appear in the exam but ended up appearing. </p><p>But here’s the thing, because I felt like a fraud I ended up studying harder for the next exam with the fear of being exposed as someone who just got lucky in the last one. So is this feeling really a bad thing?</p><h3>‍<br>‍<strong>Why does imposter syndrome occur?</strong><br></h3><p>From my personal experience, I can say that imposter syndrome mainly occurs in people who have self taught themselves the skill that they are currently using to make a living. </p><p>In my case it is software development. I was not particularly good at it in college even though I was studying computer science. I was just an average student if not below average.</p><p>After I left college I started working in early stage startups where there is no structure or someone to teach you stuff. The only option is to do your own research and learn things yourself. Google and Stack overflow were my only true friends.</p><p>Because I never really went through a “standard program” I always have this self doubt and I never know if the way I am doing things is the right way or not and the fact that there is no defined right way of doing things in software does not make this any easier.<br></p><h3><strong>How do you use this as a strength</strong><br></h3><p>My co-founder and I built a business that <a href="https://www.preetamnath.com/blog/grow-shopify-micro-saas-to-25k-mrr-in-14-months" target="_blank">we grew to $25k MRR</a>. Because of my imposter syndrome I have convinced myself that most of it was luck. We were in the right place at the right time. <br></p><p>The fact that we did 2 months of research on the market and product, spent a lot of time figuring out where we would get distribution from even before writing a single line of code seemed to have conveniently slipped my mind. The reason we even did all of this in the first place was our fear of not being good enough.<br></p><p>We have now started a <a href="https://www.delightchat.io/" target="_blank">new venture</a> and hired a team. Now because of the fact that we had a successful venture in the past, I am now under immense pressure to make this new one a success otherwise I might get exposed as a “fraud” or someone who “just got lucky”. <br></p><p>Because I have no other option but to make this a success I am going to work hard once again just like I did in my last venture. I would like to think that this imposter syndrome has turned into a strength. It is a feature and not a bug.<br></p><h3><strong>Closing notes</strong><br></h3><p>Some amount of self doubt is healthy and it keeps you on your toes. It also prevents you from letting your previous success go to your head and always be open for new learnings.<br></p><p>It enables you to be open to the suggestions given by your teammates which you might otherwise ignore just because they are less experienced than you if you had no self doubt at all. <br></p><p>Having said that, it is also not right to doubt yourself to an extent where it starts impacting you in a negative way. For instance, what if your teammates catch wind of your immense self doubt and they start losing faith in you? This is also not something you can afford.<br></p><p>One must have a healthy balance of self doubt and faith in yourself that you are moving in the right direction.</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

October 3, 2020 | http://www.infinitepartitions.com/cgi-bin/showarticle.cgi?article=art001 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.infinitepartitions.com/cgi-bin/showarticle.cgi?article=art001">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><tbody><tr><td><div id="main">
<p>
In this article I describe the DEFLATE algorithm that GZIP implements and depends on. The DEFLATE algorithm uses a combination of LZ77, Huffman codes and run-length-encoding; this article describes each in detail by walking through an example and developing source code to implement the algorithm. My aim is to implement readable rather than efficient or extensible code. I'll focus here on unzipping, rather than zipping, but by the end of the article, the zipping process should be clear.
</p>
<p>
Material intended for human consumption tends to be highly redundant, from an information processing perspective. Because of the mysterious human mind, we need to have the same thing repeated to us in different ways in order for it to be processed correctly. Natural language, for example, is inefficient - the English language phrase "I am going to the store" could easily be abbreviated "I go store". If the subject of conversation has already been established as "me", it could be further abbreviated unambiguously as "go store". This is how children communicate until they are taught proper grammar - but as we mature, we like/want/need the redundancy.
</p>
<p>
Computers are no better when it comes to demanding redundancy. Computer programs repeat the same instructions over and over again, and program source code is verbose, even when the programmer isn't concerned about using readable variable names (you know who you are). Computer storage, on the other hand, is a scarce resource. It becomes less and less scarce every day, but every time capacity increases, we seem to find a way to run out of it. I'm sure that someday, my children will be complaining that their thumbnail computer devices can "only store four holodeck simulations!"
</p>
<p>
Computer scientists have been studying ways to use computer storage more efficiently since the 1960s. In 1977, Abraham Lempel and Jacob Ziv published "A Universal Algorithm for Sequential Data Compression " [1] which described what is now referred to as the "LZ77" compression algorithm. Conceptually, LZ77 is pretty straightforward - read the source document, and, for each sequence of bytes encountered, search backward through the document to see if the same sequence occurs previously. If so, rather than outputting the sequence, output a back pointer to the first occurrence of the sequence.
</p>
<p>
To get a sense of just how redundant English text is, take a look at figure 1 and figure 2. Figure 1 contains the first few verses of the Bible's book of Genesis and figure 2 shows all of the places where text from a prior point in the document is repeated. LZ77 does a very good job of exploiting that redundancy and making efficient use of available storage.

<p>
The first 17 verses, with LZ77 compression applied, is shown below. The &lt;#,#&gt; brackets indicate backpointers in the form &lt;distance, length&gt;. So, the first backpointer &lt;25,5&gt; indicates that, to uncompress the document, search backward 25 characters, and reproduce the five characters you find there. As you can see, the first sentence is mostly uncompressed, but by the middle of the text, there's almost no uncompressed text.

</p>
<p>
Example 1: LZ77 compressed representation of the first 17 verses of Genesis
</p>
<p>
This relatively short document is compressed at just over 3:1 - and the compression ratio generally improves as documents get longer.
</p>
<p>
Of course, when discussing computer formats, it's not enough to talk about concepts - a concrete representation must be agreed upon. The decoder/decompressor must have a way to distinguish which input bytes are literals, and which input bytes are backpointers. One simple, naive representation might be to introduce an "escape code" - say, 0x255, to distinguish backpointers from literals. Of course, a literal escape code would need to be similarly escaped.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, all of these escape codes end up defeating the purpose of compressing in the first place. As it turns out, there's a better way to encode these backpointers and still allow them to be correctly distinguished from literals: variable length codes. In ordinary byte-oriented data, each code is a fixed length (typically 8 bits). Variable length codes remove this restriction. Some codes can be shorter and some can be longer. Once there's no need to restrict yourself to eight-bit bytes, you can define an arbitrarily-sized "alphabet", which is exactly what GZIP does. The first 255 characters in this alphabet are the literal codes - the 8-bit bytes that were read from the input stream. The 256th character is a "stop code" that tells the decode when to stop decoding. The 257-285th codes indicate the length of the matched range (followed immediately by a distance code).
</p>
<p>
Now, if there are only 285-257=28 length codes, that doesn't give the LZ77 compressor much room to reuse previous input. Instead, the deflate format uses the 28 pointer codes as an indication to the decompressor as to how many extra bits follow which indicate the actual length of the match. This logic is complex but important for compatibility; I'll cover it in more detail below.
</p>
<p>
In a fixed-length world, this 285-symbol alphabet would require 9 bits per symbol, but would use only a little more than half of the available 512 bytes that 9 bits can encode. This alphabet can be encoded much more efficiently by assigning the symbols variable-length codes. However, the problem with variable length codes is that the decoder needs to know where one code ends and the other begins. This isn't a problem with fixed-length codes such as ASCII - the decoder reads 8 bits, decodes them, and then reads another 8 bits. To ensure that the encoder can unambiguously interpret the variable length codes, you have to be careful how you assign these codes. Imagine that you were dealing with a four-character "alphabet" with four variable-length codes:
</p>
<pre>1. A: 1
2. B: 0
3. C: 10
4. D: 11
</pre>
<p>
Example 2: Invalid variable-length code assignment
</p>
<p>
The problem with this assignment is that the codes are ambiguous. The decoder can't tell if the input sequence "10" is an A followed by a B, or a C by itself.
</p>
<p>
The solution is to assign prefix codes. With prefix codes, once you use a prefix to delineate a range of codes, it can't be used by itself as a code. So if the character "A" is assigned the 1-bit code "1", no other code can start with "1". If "B" is assigned the code "01", no other code can start with "01". A valid Huffman coding of the four-character alphabet above, then, is:
</p>
<pre>1. A: 1
2. B: 01
3. C: 001
4. D: 000
</pre>
<p>
Example 3: Valid prefix-coding variable-length code assignment
</p>
<p>
This means that there can only be one 1-bit code, one two-bit code, two three-bit codes, four four-bit codes, etc. You may deal with prefix codes on a regular basis - the country calling codes that allow you to make international phone calls are assigned using prefix code rules. Prefix codes are usually referred to as Huffman codes [2] after the inventor of a provably optimal algorithm for generating them when symbol probabilities are known. These Huffman codes are often represented as trees, where each leaf is a symbol, and each branch is a bit value.
</p>
<p>
<img src="http://www.infinitepartitions.com/huffman_tree_1.gif">
</p><p>Figure 3: a prefix code tree</p>

<p>
Once such a tree structure has been constructed, decoding is simple - start at the top of the tree and read in a bit of data. If the bit is a 0, follow the left-branch of the tree; if 1, follow the right-branch. When a leaf node is hit, stop; a symbol has been completely read. Output the symbol and return to the top of the tree.
</p>
<p>
Listing 1 illustrates a tree structure for representing Huffman codes in memory:
</p>
<pre>typedef struct huffman_node_t
{
  int code; // -1 for non-leaf nodes
  struct huffman_node_t *zero;
  struct huffman_node_t *one;
}
huffman_node;

<p>As the reading time estimate crept over 30 minutes, without any end in sight, I was starting to feel like a bit of a blowhard.</p>



<p>The draft I’d originally intended to inaugurate this blog is still sitting there. Maybe I will condense and finish it (eventually), but I think it makes more sense to write <s>briefly</s> less long-windedly about what I mean. Instead of trying to exhaust the subject matter, I’m going to offer a perspective, and present a more intuitive argument for it.</p>



<p>So, more briefly, I’d like to ask you to think, for a moment, about what makes humans <em>ethically</em> important. There are two parts to this question, hidden just under the surface. The first asks you to consider why humans are ethical <em>agents</em>. What makes it possible for them to do, want, or experience things that could fall under the umbrella of ethics? The second (no particular order) asks you to consider why humans are ethical <em>patients</em>. How is it that what happens to them, what is wanted of them, or what is experienced about them might also be part of an ethical problem? (This agent/patient distinction I inherit from Coeckelbergh, whose book, <em>Growing Moral Relations</em>, is worth your time.)</p>



<p>I will add before you start: ethics has been defined in a few different ways, over the millennia. I consider a few definitions interesting. </p>



<p>Charles Taylor, for instance, describes ethics as pertaining not just to moral choices and obligations between people, but questions like “what is the good life?” and “what is good?”. His more expansive account, following Aristotle, moves closer to the Greek root, which refers to one’s <em>character</em>, and can be read to have a slant towards something resembling <em>virtue ethics</em>. Using Taylor, we could ask questions like “what is it good to love?” and not just “what is the right way to act?” </p>



<p>Conversely, followers of Nietzsche contrast <em>ethics</em> with <em>morality</em>, arguing that morality is about passing judgment on what people (or living beings) are and do, whereas ethics can be about <em>affirming</em> life as intrinsically self-justifying. From a (post-) Nietzschean point of view, life’s capacity to want, struggle, and change, <em>is, from the very beginning, what is good</em> (maybe not in those words). Living well means trying to overcome the need to judge, and instead to explore and express what it is to be alive, for all its intensities and tragedies. Nietzsche is often read to be asking his readers to abandon compassion, or to think only of themselves and never of the common good, but I don’t think that is exactly the case. Nietzsche is asking us to live in pursuit of what is good, but not to define it as the enemy of the bad, rather, to live <em>for its own sake, come what may</em>, and to do what is good, <em>defined in itself</em>, rather than as a reaction.</p>



<p>I don’t know Coeckelbergh’s position on ethics broadly, but he considers morality to be embedded in social relationships themselves. Rather than what is right or wrong to do to a <em>patient</em> being about its properties (whether it has consciousness, for instance) and defined in absolute terms, morality is about what relationships exist between an agent and a patient, and what kinds of relationships are good to have, knowing what the agent and patient already are to each other. Do I already mostly act like it’s a person? I should probably treat it like one. Coeckelbergh is interesting in that he tries to legitimate ideas that have, until recently, not had much hearing in the community of western philosophers, although citing him as a source for them over others might, fairly, be challenged. For instance, he would consider our dependence on our ecology grounds to entertain an obligation towards it. I haven’t finished his book yet, so I’m not aware of the extent of the advice he gives for considering problems in these relationships, but it seems fair to say that he doesn’t believe there’s a system of absolute rules out there, or that we should try to find final answers to ethical problems. Relationships are particular, and they evolve. We shouldn’t seek to use the fact that we don’t get hard answers for our convenience; instead, we should consider relationships, for their lumpiness, their particularity, their uncertainty, and live them as best we can.</p>



<p>All of these viewpoints are very different from our ordinary patterns of ethical thought. We are used to thinking that <em>individuals</em>, or sometimes <em>social groups</em> (such as nations) have <em>rights</em> that must be guaranteed to them, but everything else goes. Sometimes, referencing Isaiah Berlin, we might say we believe that this obligation is <em>negative</em> (there are some things that people are fundamentally allowed to do, and our only obligation is to stop people who try to mess with that), or it is <em>positive</em> (there are some things that people should fundamentally be allowed to do, and we need to do our best to make that possible for them). Maybe, for whatever definition of the good, we are utilitarians, who think that we should do the most good for the most people, whatever means that could entail. Perhaps we take the <em>view from afar</em>, and ask “if I had the choice of all reasonably possible societies, which would I like to be born into, knowing that I might be anyone?” Perhaps we see ethics as different versions of the trolley problem, and find reasons, based on our moral intuitions, about what choices we should make when push comes to shove. Some of us, unfashionably, believe in immortal souls and divine law, against which we must not sin, or that her majesty inherits the right to judge from God, and that the highest good is obedience to an Earthly law. A scientist, being familiar with Hume, might read his argument that we cannot derive statements about what <em>ought to be</em> from statements about what <em>is</em>, and see cause to be an anti-realist. Maybe <em>ought</em> statements only express our personal preferences, derived from what we’ve been either (or both) biologically or socially conditioned to think is pleasing. Scientists might say this implies some sort of <em>relativism</em>, or that it’s best to follow whatever is the <em>conventional</em> way to think about ethics (although, if we’re not in the business of assuming the world is already a pretty just place to be in, that last one may not be safe). </p>



<p>So, knowing what you know about what humans are made of, and how they relate to one another, to society, or to other beings, what makes them ethical agents, and what does it mean that they are? What about patients? I think it’s probably a bad idea to try to find an answer too quickly. It might be better to think through what kinds of approaches are better, and what facts could be relevant to the question. For instance, maybe the way people want things matters, as it is defined in terms of elaborations on what’s generated by the default mode network. Maybe there can’t be exactly one right answer, or maybe there must be, or maybe it’s impossible to know. How would you argue that?</p>



<h2>Why it Matters </h2>



<p>I don’t fully agree with Taylor, but, in <em>Sources of the Self</em>, he makes a good case for why we shouldn’t be self-serving, and why we already care about ethics. He says ethics are about what we <em>want to be</em>, how we identify ourselves. This is always done in terms of social groups we identify <em>with</em>. “I am a professional, so I should…” Identity gives us community, people who share something about us (a way of life, perhaps), or maybe it contrasts us against a community (we can identify ourselves as rebels). We rarely, if ever, identify with just one thing, and it’s no use to try to come up with a completely original identity, if it’s possible to do it meaningfully at all, because it doesn’t tell us much about what we’re trying to be, given we’re the only one who would know or care that we’re being it. Identity is critically important to us in interpreting our place in the world, and what we are trying to do with it. So, says he, without identity, we would struggle to come to grips with life. It is a good thing, then, that you and I already have some ideas about <em>who we are</em>, or if we’re struggling to figure that out, generally already acknowledge that it <em>is</em> an important thing to get down. Taylor says that, since it’s all about coming to grips with life, we escape Hume’s is/ought problem, because we don’t have to set up an ethics from scratch. Ethics are already there from the beginning, and have some known properties, so we can argue about them by contrasting them. “Given these two frameworks, which one of them provides the richer set of tools for figuring out how to live a good life?” To Taylor, ethics are certainly <em>real</em>, but not in the sense that they’re an object embedded in a reality perfectly detached from us, rather, they come <em>from</em> the fact that we are social creatures, and relate <em>to</em> how we are trying to live in society. They aren’t just individual, or perfectly culturally relative (as there are no perfectly incommensurable cultures, which share none of the same moral ideas and cannot communicate with each other), but they aren’t exactly objective and final either.</p>



<p>I like Taylor, for how he grounds consciousness of <em>ethics</em> in <em>social consciousness</em>, and I like how good he is at striking down the (usually unanswerable) “why should I care about ethics?” question. I share Coeckelbergh’s complaint that he considers only one kind of relation (between the individual and the community), and I would also gripe that his ethics are unusually centred on the <em>self</em>, for a subject that tends to ask us to think beyond ourselves. But then, that is why the argument against selfishness works so well. It’s difficult to get through to somebody who only thinks of themself unless that’s the place you’re starting from. </p>



<p>Taylor’s other issues, which I will not go too in-depth on here, are first, that he frames the source of ethics as appearing in the fact that one is an <em>ind…</em></p></div></section></main></div></div>

<h2>What’s wrong with Disqus</h2>
<p>Disqus loads absurd amount of tracking services, which exposes your visitors’
personal data and significantly increases loading time. See, e.g., 
<a href="http://donw.io/post/github-comments/#what-s-wrong-with-disqus">this post</a>.</p>
<h2>What’s not covered here</h2>
<p>For a static website, one usually wants a lightweight commenting server with
as little dependencies as possible. Few commenting engines listed on the page
are provided by heavy applications (e.g.,
<a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse">discourse</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/debiki/talkyard">talkyard</a>), but the majority are
relatively lightweight applications designed specifically to provide 
comments for the static pages.</p>
<p>This page prioritizes information on self-hosted comments. However, there
are other open-source solutions, including implementations of third-party
services (e.g., Github issues, such as
<a href="https://github.com/imsun/gitment">[1]</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/gitalk/gitalk">[2]</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/Blankj/awesome-comment">[3]</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/utterance/utterances">[4]</a>).</p>
<h2>Stars vs. time</h2>
<p>The figure below shows some of the top competitors except for Discourse (as it's not
just a light commenting server like others). The figure is useful to
indirectly estimate how active the project is.</p>
