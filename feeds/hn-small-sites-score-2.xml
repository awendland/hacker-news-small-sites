                    <h2>Feeling great</h2>
<p>What do you want people to feel when they talk to you? Happiness, sadness or maybe everything combined? </p>
<p>Do you want people to be inspired or motivated to tackle new and exiting problems? </p>
<p>Do you want to make the world a better place?</p>
<p>I think to understand your life purpose, you gotta understand yourself first. Not in a psychoanalytical way, but in a spiritual and reflectional way.</p>
<p>Don’t beat yourself up. Make yourself proud inside of you. If you are proud of what you do, then it means that you are following your heart. If you are following your heart, you are doing the best work you can, because there are too many people that do things for money. If you want to succeed, then there is no better strategy than that.</p>
<p>Live the life that you would feel proud about telling your grandchildren. Live the life that would inspire your children and will set a good role model for them. Be a person that is open to every opportunity, but chooses only those that align with their goals. Be open to success and closed for disappointment.</p>
<p>Shoot each time you have an idea, and don’t afraid to fail. You can miss and embers yourself just a little. Or you can never shoot and never achieve anything in life. Which one sounds worse?</p>
<h2>Understand your surrounding</h2>
<p>The most important part of being successful is in alignment with your surrounding.</p>
<p>Look around yourself. Do your habits improve it? Do people around you improve and getter better because of your actions? Are you on your way to helping others?</p>
<p>Humans are social beings, and the language that we have developed is the biggest indicator of that. If we could survive alone, we wouldn’t have needed a language to communicate. </p>
<p>You need to check up on others and help them. This will cause a domino effect, and in the end, you will benefit even more from that.</p>
<p>You are 5 people who you spend most of your time with. List those people and check if they are improving you and your well being, or are they destroying it? It is essential to make those 5 people stronger and better than you. This will allow you to grow, which will allow you that effect to trickle to other people, improving their lives.</p>
<h2>Don’t be afraid to try</h2>
<p>If you have a particular thing that you want to experiment, calculate how much will it cost. Mostly the things we are the most afraid of trying or doing we can try or do for less than $500 and the drawbacks are not irreversible.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to shoot and fail. Try and see how it goes. You can always roll back to the point of start.</p>
<p>Start now. Get perfect later.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
				<p>Brought to you by the “I hate Mondays” department of Tales Of A Tech.</p>
<p>We would like to remind you that if there is a problem and you can’t seem to figure it out there’s always one solution to look to: It’s ALWAYS DNS.</p>

<p><strong>The Story:</strong></p>
<p>Last night I was trying to login to this site in order to make a post about my drone shenanigans (which, by the way, is <a href="https://talesofatech.com/2017/03/drone-shenanigans/">here</a>). &nbsp;I was already super frustrated because Mass Effect: Andromeda is coded by a team of (apparently) monkeys who don’t understand how to make working autosave features (my autosave files are all corrupt, causing me to lose 5+ hours of gameplay) and the site wasn’t being cooperative. &nbsp;I was reaching “blow-your-top” levels of frustration. &nbsp;I was finally able to connect and login but I immediately noticed things were running VERY slowly. &nbsp;It was weird, and I couldn’t figure out why. EVERYTHING seemed slow. &nbsp;Even the SSH connection was jittery and laggy.</p>
<p>At first I thought it was a problem with the network in the apartment. &nbsp;It happens from time to time. &nbsp;We run a lot of equipment in our apartment. &nbsp;I ran some speed tests and some other diagnostics and found that everything seemed to be working. &nbsp;Very weird.</p>
<p>Since I managed to SSH in I decided to check some logs. &nbsp;There didn’t seem to be anything in the apache log. &nbsp;fail2ban wasn’t being uncooperative. MySQL was running and seemingly accepting localhost connections. &nbsp;Very weird. &nbsp;I resorted to the only thing I could think of next: I rebooted the box.</p>
<p>Everything&nbsp;came back up (yay) but the site was still clunky and slow (not so yay).</p>
<p>I decided to enable verbose logging in apache and attempt to restart the service. &nbsp;It timed out. The hell?</p>
<p>I ran “journalctl -xe” per service failure message and noticed a peculiar entry:</p>
<pre>Mar 27 21:17:51 TalesOfAnAdmin systemd[1]: apache2.service: Start operation timed out. Terminating.
Mar 27 21:17:51 TalesOfAnAdmin systemd[1]: Failed to start The Apache HTTP Server.</pre>
<p>Failed to start due to timeout? &nbsp;Timeout of what? SO CONFUSED.</p>
<p>Digging back a little further I saw another confusing line:</p>
<pre>Mar 27 21:15:12 TalesOfAnAdmin apachectl[1860]: [Mon Mar 27 21:15:12.835322 2017] [core:error] [pid 1864] (EAI 2)Name or service not known: AH00547: Could not resolve host name maplerangers.com</pre>
<p>Huh. &nbsp;Weird.</p>
<p>I had a quick confab with Nick and he suggested I check if my websites were in my hostfile. &nbsp;They weren’t, so I added them. &nbsp;Apache startup became instantaneous. &nbsp;Things seemed to be improving. &nbsp;Cool.</p>
<p>I logged in to the website which was up and more responsive, but absolutely slow. &nbsp;Very weird still. &nbsp;I noticed an error on my WordPress Administration page: “curl error 28: operation timed out”</p>
<p>What the hell?</p>
<p>So back to the SSH I go. &nbsp;I try pinging wordpress.com: &nbsp;Unknown host. &nbsp;I try pinging google.com: Unknown host. &nbsp;I try pinging an IP Address for those sites: Working fine.</p>
<p>Grrrr!</p>
<p>I look at /etc/resolv.conf — I’m using Google DNS. &nbsp;Ok.</p>
<p>Let’s see if DigitalOcean has anything about this: Bingo!</p>
<blockquote data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Our engineering team is investigating reports of DNS connectivity issues while using the Google resolvers. During… <a href="https://t.co/cEpXMPJ3Nq">https://t.co/cEpXMPJ3Nq</a></p>
<p>— DigitalOcean Status (@DOStatus) <a href="https://twitter.com/DOStatus/status/846430105094250496">March 27, 2017</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I edit the resolv.conf (and interfaces) to reflect a change to OpenDNS as the primary DNS with Google as the fallback DNS (as per the article linked later in the Tweet).</p>
<p>Restart networking.</p>
<p>Boom, everything is working.</p>
<p>It was DNS.</p>
<p><span><strong>It’s always DNS.</strong></span></p>
<p>-M, out.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Message queues are one of the critical components in any software architecture which helps different components talk to each other asynchronously. In this article let's discuss what message queues are, how they're used in modern architectures and what problems do they solve.</p>
<p>Let's say you want to withdraw some money from an ATM. An ATM machine can only allow one person to do transactions at a time. In this case, what do you do when you see there's a person already using the ATM machine? Do you wait in a queue or do you go back thinking you cannot withdraw money from this machine?</p>
<p>Exactly! You wait in a queue until your turn comes.</p>
<p>So when many people want to withdraw money they will have to wait in a queue and go to the ATM machine in the same order in which they entered the queue. This is one real world example of queues and message queues serve the same purpose in any software architecture.</p>
<p>We will talk about below topics in this article:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="#properties">Other properties of message queues</a></li>
<li><a href="#resources">Resources</a></li>
<li><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-are-message-queues">What Are Message Queues?</h3>
<p>A queue is a First-In First-Out data structure. If you have a computer science background you know how a queue data structure works: the first element pushed into the queue is the first item extracted. It's basically the same concept as what we discussed in our ATM machine example.</p>
<p>A message queue is basically a queuing service used in micro services &amp; server-less architectures to decouple different components that are easier to develop, scale &amp; maintain in the long term. Message queues helps different components to communicate asynchronously by passing messages between them.</p>
<p>Generally in applications where message queues are used there are producers who create and put the messages into message queues. And there are consumers or worker processes which read those messages and take actions.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605504976290/uqTaa9q5A.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="imageedit_2_4624157258.png"></p>
<p>A message is any data that is passed between two components. It contains all the information needed for the worker components to take actions.</p>
<p>Let's consider a use case where we have to recharge a customer's account. The worker component need to know these details: account_id, card_id, amount (in dollars).</p>
<p>The message the producer creates and puts into a message queues will look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>{
    <span>"account_id"</span>: <span>12345</span>,
    <span>"card_id"</span>: <span>567</span>,
    <span>"amount"</span>: <span>100</span>
}
</code></pre><p>As you can see, the above message contains all the information that a worker process needs to recharge this customer's account.</p>
<p>There are many third party message queueing services like Rabbit MQ, Kafka, Amazon SQS to name a few. Each one of them provide different features suitable for different use cases.</p>

<h3 id="how-are-message-queues-used-in-a-system">How Are Message Queues Used In A System?</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier message queues are used to decouple different components in a system. But what does it mean to decouple a system? It basically means the process of separating functions so that they're more independent and self contained.</p>
<p>Let's discuss it with an example. Let's say we need an application to generate invoices and send it to our customers at the end of the month. For the sake of this discussion let's assume that generating invoices is a time taking process and take anywhere between few seconds to a minute to generate one single invoice which involves doing the below steps in order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get customer account details</li>
<li>Get customer billing details</li>
<li>Get data for different products used by the customer during the month</li>
<li>Apply any onetime charges and charge customers</li>
<li>Finally generate a invoice PDF and send it to the customer</li>
</ul>
<p>How would you implement such a functionality?</p>
<p>This is how a naive developer would approach it: Build a single REST service which accepts requests and does the above steps. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605506280058/Y03xhpEYG.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="imageedit_2_8235631782.png"></p>
<p>This is a monolith architecture and has many problems with it:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>No Fault Tolerance:</strong> Fault tolerance is the ability for a system to continue operating without any interruption when one or more of its components fail. Since we have a single REST service, if the service goes down, the whole application stops working.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Components Cannot Be Scaled Independently:</strong> If we want to scale the application when the number of customers accounts increase, then we have to scale the whole application. This means more resources will be used since we cannot scale any individual component independently. So the use cases like Get Account Details will be scaled even though it is unnecessary because this components generally gets less traffic.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>No Freedom of Language:</strong> Since all the components are built using a single application, a single language / framework need to be used to build the complete application. We cannot use different languages for different components since the whole application is a single code repository which is built and deployed together.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Increase in Development and Deployment Time:</strong> Having all the components as one single codebase will increase the development time. Since this is a big application, it's possible that different teams would be working on different components of the system at any point in time. So all the teams need to take care of code consistency, code quality and also have to spend time in resolving merge conflicts since active development will be going on. This adds to the development time. Also with bigger codebase it takes more time to build and deploy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As seen above there are many problems if we go with a monolith architecture for the given problem statement. We need to divide the application into multiple components like Invoice Generation Service, Invoice Generation Service Worker, Account Service, PDF Generation Service etc.</p>
<p>Let's see how diving this into multiple services &amp; having a message queue to communicate between them will solve these problems.</p>

<h3 id="what-problems-do-message-queues-solve">What Problems Do Message Queues Solve?</h3>
<p>With micro services architecture, the architecture would look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605508126047/PhUZ4K-mV.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="imageedit_2_2135728654.png"></p>
<p>In this architecture the Invoice Generation Service will create a message for every customer account. This message would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>{
    <span>"account_id"</span>: <span>12345</span>,
    <span>"invoice_start_date"</span>: <span>"2020-10-01"</span>,
    <span>"invoice_end_date"</span>: <span>"2020-10-31"</span>
}
</code></pre><p>Therefore if we have 1000 accounts there will be 1000 messages pushed into the queue. The worker service will contain multiple workers. Each worker will pickup a message and start processing it. All the workers will be running concurrently. Each of these workers will talk to Account Service, Billing Service and PDF Generation Services which are micro services themselves.</p>
<p>Now let's see how each of the problems mentioned above will be solved with this architecture.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong> Fault Tolerance</strong>: If one of the component fails the other will work seamlessly. Let's say if Invoice Generation Service Worker is down for reasons, Invoice Generation Service will continue to work and keep pushing messages into the queue. It is not dependent on whether Worker service is up or not. If Invoice Generation Service is down, Worker service will continue to pull the messages from the queue and continue to generate invoices. So now there is fault tolerance in the system.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Scalability:</strong> Now since the components are independent of one another they can be scaled independently too. All the heavy weight work is being done by the Worker service and Invoice Generation Service is just creating and pushing the messages into the message queue. So we need more computing power for the Worker service. So we can have powerful machines to run Worker service and we can add more tasks if the number of accounts increase in the future. Whereas the Invoice Generation Service can be run on less powerful machines. With this architecture we're able to scale the different components independently.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Freedom of Language:</strong> Having multiple components like this will give us the freedom to implement different components in different programming languages and frameworks. For example: Invoice Generation Service can be implemented in Java. Worker can be implemented in GoLang.
And if let's say we have another service which is responsible for generating invoice pdf, this can be implemented in Python. So having multiple components like this and having a message queue for communication between them will give us the flexibility over languages used in the architecture.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improved Developer Productivity &amp; Deployment Time:</strong> Since different components can be developed independently, the developer productivity will increase since they don't have to spend more time in co-ordinating when adding new features, resolving merge conflicts etc. Also the codebase of each of the component or service will be lighter and will have a separate deployment pipeline. So the quality, build and deployment time will decrease.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other-properties-of-message-queues">Other Properties Of Message Queues</h3>
<p>Different message queuing services offer different message queues with properties like visibility timeout, message retention period, message size etc based on the popular use cases in the industry.</p>
<p>AWS provided message queuing service is called SQS (Simple Queue Service).</p>
<p>Let's discuss about SQS provided message queues and their properties in this section which gives you an idea on the different types of properties available with message queues in general.</p>
<p>AWS SQS offers two types of message queues:</p>
<h4 id="standard-queue">Standard Queue:</h4>
<p>Amazon SQS offers standard as the default queue type. Standard queues support a nearly unlimited number of API calls per second, per API action (SendMessage, ReceiveMessage, or DeleteMessage). Standard queues support at-least-once message delivery. However, occasionally (because of the highly distributed architecture that allows nearly unlimited throughput), more than one copy of a message might be delivered out of order. Standard queues provide best-effort ordering which ensures that messages are generally delivered in the same order as they're sent.</p>
<h4 id="fifo-queue">FIFO Queue:</h4>
<p>FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues are designed to enhance messaging between applications when the order of operations and events is critical, …</p></div></div>

Overall textiles exports were valued at $39 billion in 2018 and are expected to more than double by 2021.</span></p><p id="viewer-9shou"><span>Part of the growth comes from various government initiatives, such as a 2018 increase in basic customs duties from 10 percent to 20 percent on more than 500 textile products. Another contributor is India’s robust production of relevant input materials, such as cotton, which lend supply chain and cost advantages.</span></p><p id="viewer-faukb"><span>These exports include knitted, woven and crocheted textiles and apparel, carpets and textile floor coverings and man-made filaments.</span></p><p id="viewer-7r4hg"><span>Despite China’s current dominance in export value, India’s government is making serious efforts to invest in the country’s manufacturing sector.

Mounting U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods over the past year have only strengthened the case for India as a cost-effective manufacturing alternative.

According to September 2019 data from the World Bank, India’s labor force numbers about 519 million. China’s labor force is still much larger with 783 million strong.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently created a tool called <a href="https://github.com/polm/cutlet">cutlet</a> for converting Japanese to romaji.
While working on cutlet I was surprised at the difficulty of finding a good
guide to the difference between romaji systems, particularly their history and
usage, so I wrote this up.</p>
<h2 id="a-romaji-refresher"> A Romaji Refresher</h2>
<p>There are three relatively well-defined romaji systems. For a quick overview of
some of their differences:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Japanese</th>
<th>新橋</th>
<th>お茶漬け</th>
<th>富士山</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Hepburn</td>
<td>Shinbashi (or Shimbashi)</td>
<td>ochazuke</td>
<td>Fujisan</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kunreisiki</td>
<td>Sinbasi</td>
<td>otyazuke</td>
<td>Huzisan</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nipponsiki</td>
<td>Sinbasi</td>
<td>otyaduke</td>
<td>Huzisan</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Hepburn is the most widely used outside Japan, Kunreisiki is officially taught
to children in Japan. Nipponsiki is similar to Kunreisiki but older. Technically
Hepburn uses macrons for long vowels while Kunreisiki and Nipponsiki use
circumflexes, but usage isn't consistent and there's no difference in meaning
between them.</p>
<p>In recent years "wapuro" romaji, based on input when typing Japanese, are also
relatively common, but it's not systematized (except in as far as programs
either take or don't take certain sequences) and isn't used in any kind of
formal writing.</p>
<h2 id="particle-comparison"> Particle Comparison</h2>
<p>As another refresher, here's how non-phonetic particles are represented in the
various systems.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Japanese</th>
<th>は</th>
<th>を</th>
<th>へ</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Hepburn</td>
<td>wa</td>
<td>wo</td>
<td>e</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kunreisiki</td>
<td>wa</td>
<td>o</td>
<td>e</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nipponsiki</td>
<td>ha</td>
<td>wo</td>
<td>he</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Hepburn is phonetic except for <em>wo</em>, Kunreisiki is strictly phonetic, and
Nipponsiki is strictly orthographic.</p>
<h2 id="early-romaji"> Early Romaji</h2>
<p>Japanese was first written in the Latin alphabet in the 1600s, mainly by
Christian missionaries. It was used by the missionaries for recording and
learning the language, and also used in texts they produced to try to spread
Christianity. Since Christianity was later supressed in Japan, these forms of
romaji never had wide adoption, though they influenced later efforts.</p>
<h2 id="the-origins-of-the-hepburn-system"> The Origins of the Hepburn System</h2>
<p>In 1867, missionary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Curtis_Hepburn#Missionary_work_in_Japan">James Curtis Hepburn</a> published a
Japanese-English dictionary in Yokohama. Naturally he needed some way to write
Japanese words for people who couldn't read Japanese, so he devised a system of
representing Japanese that reflected the pronunciation of English consonants.
His system wasn't designed from the ground up, but developed based on his
knowledge of existing systems by other missionaries as well as his own
knowledge of Japanese.</p>
<p>Somewhat later, in 1885, an organization known as the
<a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9E%E5%AD%97%E8%AB%96#%E3%83%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9E%E5%AD%97%E4%BC%9A">羅馬字会</a>
(Romajikai) was established. Mainly a society of Japanese academics, it was
interested in promoting the use of romaji as a replacement for kana and kanji.
Some motivations for getting rid of native writing systems included easier
international communication and improved domestic literacy. The principle
founders were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ry%C5%8Dkichi_Yatabe">Ryoukichi Yatabe</a>, a botanist and the first Japanese graduate of Cornell, and <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A4%96%E5%B1%B1%E6%AD%A3%E4%B8%80">Masakazu Toyama</a>, a <a href="https://ii.umich.edu/cjs/history-of-cjs.html">graduate of the University of Michigan</a> who
later occupied a high post at what would eventually become Tokyo University.</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/4d041d6a/max-moritz-romaji.jpg"><img src="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/4d041d6a/img/max-moritz-romaji.jpg.l.jpg"></a><figcaption>The Romajikai published books to promote romaji, including this translation of Max and Moritz, titled "Wampaku Monogatari". This edition was reprinted in 1978. via <a href="https://www.wul.waseda.ac.jp/kotenseki/html/he22/he22_07214/index.html">Waseda University</a>
</figcaption></figure>
<p>In 1886 the Romajikai published <a href="https://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/862485">a romaji system</a>. Also in 1886
Hepburn published the third edition of his dictionary, which roughly used the
system.  I've had trouble finding the exact nature of the influence between
Hepburn's system and the Romajikai, but they were on friendly terms and
cooperating. Hepburn's dictionary's third edition took off, the romaji system
mainly came to be called by his name, and it became widely established,
particularly among foreigners dealing with Japan.</p>
<p>If you're interested in learning more about Hepburn's dictionaries, a <a href="http://www.meijigakuin.ac.jp/mgda/waei/">wealth
of information</a> is available via Meiji Gakuin University
Library, including a comparison of romaji in all published versions and
manuscripts.</p>
<h2 id="the-origins-of-the-nipponsiki-system"> The Origins of the Nipponsiki System</h2>
<p>Around the time the Romajikai was established, one of the members, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanakadate_Aikitsu">Aikitu
Tanakadate</a>, developed his
own romaji system, based on some existing informal conventions, that was
specifically designed to mirror the structure of Japanese kana without regard
to foreign pronunciation.</p>
<p>In 1885 Tanakadate proposed this new system to the Romajikai, but they
ultimately rejected his proposal in favor of keeping Hepburn. As a result
Tanakadate left the Romajikai and promoted Nipponsiki on his own. Before
becoming known as "Nipponsiki" this style of Romanization was known as
"Tanakadatesiki".</p>
<p>The disagreement between Tanakadate was only the first in a long series of
arguments between Hepburn and Nipponsiki proponents.</p>
<p>Tanakadate was around 30 when he invented this system, and most of his later
career was in physics. He worked with Lord Kelvin in Scotland and helped bring
about the adoption of the metric system in Japan. He used romaji in personal
writings and promoted it throughout his life. We'll be seeing him again later.</p>
<h2 id="standard-form-and-the-romaji-hirome-kai"> Standard Form and the Romaji Hirome Kai</h2>
<p>In 1905 the ローマ字ひろめ会 (Romaji Hirome Kai, "Society for the Advancement
of Romaji") was established. They published a magazine, called simply "Rômaji",
to create more reading material in romaji and spread its use within Japan.  By
this point Toyama and Yatabe had both passed away, and it's unclear if the
original Romajikai still existed in any capacity. An important early member of
the new society was <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%97%A4%E5%B2%A1%E5%8B%9D%E4%BA%8C">Katsuji Fujioka</a>, who wrote the
<a href="https://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/942994">羅馬字手引</a> (Romaji Tebiki), a kind of romaji dictionary.</p>
<p>Shortly after it was founded the Romaji Hirome Kai proposed a slightly modified
Hepburn and called it 標準式, or "Standard Form". Note that this is "Standard
Form" in general, not "Standard Hepburn", suggesting this was some kind of
official standard romanization system; this may have been a response to
Tanakadatesiki becoming known as "Nipponsiki", which could imply that other
romaji systems were "foreign". As we'll see in a bit, this rhetorical trick
ultimately didn't help official adoption.</p>
<p>I haven't been able to track down the original document with Standard Form, but
the Romaji Tebiki was already using it in 1906.</p>
<p>Standard Form replaced macrons with circumflexes and always romanized ん as
"n", rather than sometimes using "m" depending on the following consonant.</p>
<p>Tanakadate was still around and joined the Romaji Hirome Kai at some point, but
got fed up with their use of Hepburn, left, and founded his own organization in
1914.</p>
<h2 id="the-origins-of-kunreisiki"> The Origins of Kunreisiki</h2>
<p>In 1930 the government formed a committee to evaluate various romaji systems
for official government use. At this point Tanakadate was a member of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Peers_(Japan)">House of Peers</a>, and Romaji Hirome Kai member and Hepburn proponent
Fujioka was not a politician, but had political influence due to his long and
prominent career as a linguist. Both were involved with the government
committee.</p>
<p>While the system used at this point varied considerably by government agency,
Hepburn was more popular, so it seemed slated for official adoption.  However,
in 1935 Fujioka died of illness. In 1937, following a recommendation from the
committee, a slightly modified version of Tanakadate's Nipponsiki, dubbed
Kunreisiki, was established as the official government romaji system.</p>
<p>The main difference between Kunreisiki and Nipponsiki is that kana that are not
pronounced differently in standard modern Japanese are spelled as their more
common counterpart (づ and ず are both <em>zu</em>), though there are other
differences, like how particles are represented, and how ambiguous phonetic
boundaries are written.</p>
<h2 id="the-war"> The War</h2>
<p>Despite the recent official adoption of a government-approved romaji system,
around 1938 a number of more radical romaji proponents were arrested as
potential (or actual) anti-nationalists. One example was Esperantist and
language researcher <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%96%8E%E8%97%A4%E7%A7%80%E4%B8%80">Hidekatsu Saitou</a>, who contracted tuberculosis in
prison and died in 1940.</p>
<p>Following World War 2, the occupying American forces rescinded the law making
Kunreisiki official and ordered the use of Hepburn for public signage and
documents. During the occupation, an American educational commission
<a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pur1.32754081234191&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=28">recommended native Japanese writing be replaced with romaji</a>.
This never happened, though romaji became a standard component of post-war
education.</p>
<p>Post-war the development of romaji became less dramatic, as serious proponents
of replacing Japanese writing systems with romaji mostly disappeared. There
have been a number of laws and rules issued by the government over the years,
as well as a few special systems like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSL_romanization">unique system</a> developed for a
textbook called "Japanese: The Spoken Language", but Hepburn and
Nipponsiki/Kunreisiki remain the major systems.</p>
<p>There is also much to be written about interaction of romaji with computers,
but that's best left for another time.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-revised-hepburn%3F"> What About Revised Hepburn?</h2>
<p>Sometimes you'll see references to "Revised Hepburn", but nobody knows what
this is. It is used to mean, variously:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hepburn's system in his third edition, in contrast to earlier editions</li>
<li>the 1905 version by the ローマ字ひろめ会 (properly 標準式 or "standard form")</li>
<li>a version introduced with Kenkyuusha's "New Japanese-English Dictionary" in 1954, subsequently <a href="https://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/romanization/japanese.pdf">adopted by the American Library of Congress</a></li>
<li>other minor variants proposed at different times</li>
</ul>
<p>While the Library of Congress is surely consistent in their romaji usage, their
choice of a particular 1954 dictionary is a bit odd, and distinguishing it from
the similar 1905 system is a source of confusion. At one point it seemed like
Hepburn might become an ANSI standard, but instead Kunreisiki was adopted, and
that standard (Z39.11-1972) has since been deprecated. This lack of an official
standard contributes to inconsistency in what "Revised Hepburn" means.</p>
<p>In contrast, "traditional Hepburn" is somewhat reliably used to refer to the
system used in Hepburn's third edition as opposed to later forms.</p>
<p>Another common variant, "passport Hepburn" refers to the system previously
mandated for names on Japanese passports, which included some exceptions to
normal Hepburn, but those requirements are <a href="https://www.mofa.go.jp/mofaj/toko/passport/pass_4.html#q17">no longer strictly in force</a>,
and you can use any romanization you want (such as "George" for what would be
"Jouji" in Hepburn) if you have …</p></div></div>

<p><a href="https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/news/privacy-concerns-emerge-following-apple-ocsp-server-outage/">Following privacy concerns from Mac users after Apple’s Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) server went down, </a>thus causing third-party applications unable to open on Macs, Apple has now responded to the situation,&nbsp; exacerbated by a recent blog post by Jeffrey Paul.</p>	
	
	
	
<p>An Apple spokesperson told<em> iPhone in Canada</em> it had updated its support document, ‘Safely open apps on your Mac’, to now further detail its privacy protections.</p>
<p>“Gatekeeper performs online checks to verify if an app contains known malware and whether the developer’s signing certificate is revoked,” <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491">explains</a> Apple. “We have never&nbsp;combined data from these checks with information about Apple users or their devices. We do not use data from these checks to learn what individual users are&nbsp;launching or running on their devices,” clarified the company.</p>
<p>“Notarization checks if the app contains known malware using an encrypted connection that is resilient to server failures,” says Apple, further emphasizing, “These security checks have never included the user’s Apple ID or the identity of their device. To further protect privacy, we have stopped logging IP addresses&nbsp;associated with Developer ID certificate checks, and we will ensure that any collected IP addresses are removed from logs,” details Apple.</p>
<p>On top of this, Apple says “over the next year we will introduce several changes to our security checks,” specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>a new encrypted protocol for Developer ID certificate revocation checks</li>
<li>strong protections against server failure</li>
<li>a new preference for users to opt out of these security protections</li>
</ul>
<p>Apple also gave some further technical information on the situation to <em>iPhone in Canada.</em> Certificate revocation checks occur to verify that Developer ID certificates used to sign an app have not been revoked by the company. The move is critical for security since a certificate may be pulled if a developer suspects it has been compromised by third parties, or is being used to sign malicious apps.</p>
<p>The industry-standard online certificate status protocol (OCSP) is used by macOS to verify that the Developer ID code signing certificate issued to an app developer has not been revoked. This OCSP request does not include the Apple ID of the user, or reveal a device or app being launched.</p>
<p>Apple says since OCSP is used to check other certificates, including those used to encrypted web connections, these requests happen over unencrypted HTTP, as normal throughout the industry.</p>
<p>HTTP is used to prevent&nbsp;situations where verifying the validity of the certificate that secures the connection to an OCSP server would potentially depend on the result of a request to that same&nbsp;OCSP server, creating a loop that would make it impossible to resolve the request, according to Apple.</p>
<p>Apple says on macOS Catalina and later, by default, all apps running are notarized by the company to note they have been checked by Apple for known malicious software. When an app launches, macOS will check to verify that the app has not been labeled as malicious by Apple since it was first notarized. These checks happen over an encrypted connection—and are resilient to server failures. Which is what happened the other day and users saw their apps hang and take forever to launch.</p>
<p>What caused the OCSP server problem? Apple says it was due to a server-side misconfiguration that specifically interfered with macOS being able to cache OCSP responses for Developer ID. This configuration error, along with an unrelated content delivery network (CDN) misconfiguration, is what caused the slow performance for apps to launch.</p>
<p>Apple explained to <em>iPhone in Canada</em> it has already fixed this performance issue through a server-side update, that will now allow macOS to cache Developer ID OCSP checks for a longer period. macOS users do not need to do anything to benefit from this Apple update.</p>
<p>App notarization checks are used to verify that apps being launched in macOS have not been found to be malicious by Apple, since they were first notarized. Apple says these checks take place over an encrypted connection and are immune to server failures. Notarization checks were not affected by the server-side issue that caused OCSP requests to fail.</p>

<p>Automatic dependent surveillance–broadcast&nbsp;(ADS-B) technology enables aircraft to&nbsp;determine their position via satellite and periodically broadcast this location information. An ADS-B receiver system can be used to decode this broadcast signal to track airplanes. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system-1024x576.png" alt="" width="473" height="266" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px"><figcaption>The ADS-B System</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Now let’s take a look at the various components of an ADS-B station, why they matter, and how to make improvements. </p>



<h2><strong>ADS-B Receiver</strong></h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.onesdr.com/2020/10/21/the-best-ads-b-receiver-for-2020-2021/">this article we previously discussed the different ADS-B receivers</a> on the market today. Systems like the one from <a href="https://amzn.to/36E08h1">Garmin</a> are completely closed and fully integrated and there’s not much opportunity to understand how they work or improve them. The best you can do is use them as per the manufacturer’s recommendation and that should result in the best performance for this product.</p>







<p>On the other hand, there’s plenty of opportunity to learn from open systems based on  either the <a href="https://amzn.to/3f4pJUk">FlightAware</a> or the <a href="https://amzn.to/3kzQa59">Stratux ADS-B receivers</a>. </p>







<p>Both these systems use <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">the RTL-SDR</a> as foundational building blocks. There’s a wealth of information online on the internal architecture and various experiments conducted on these products to understand their specifications, performance and how best to use them. There’s also a large online community to learn from and contribute to. </p>



<h2>How Much ADS-B Signal Do You Really Need?</h2>



<p>In general when a receiver processes signals, there is a range of optimal signal level over which it performs best. Anything lower will result in performance degradation – in other words, you will see fewer airplanes. Anything greater will have the same effect. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ADS-B-SIGNAL-LEVELS-1024x677.png" alt="" width="495" height="327" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ADS-B-SIGNAL-LEVELS-1024x677.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ADS-B-SIGNAL-LEVELS-300x198.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ADS-B-SIGNAL-LEVELS-768x508.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ADS-B-SIGNAL-LEVELS.png 1202w" sizes="(max-width: 495px) 100vw, 495px"><figcaption>Different ADS-B Signal Ranges </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At the very extreme, signal levels higher than a certain level will damage the ADS-B receiver. The trick then is to optimize the signal level such that you can get to within the sweet spot of the ADS-B receiver. </p>



<h2><strong>A Note on Measuring Signals </strong></h2>



<p>In general, it is very difficult to predict actual wireless signal strengths received without making a measurement. Typically a spectrum analyzer is used to make signal measurements at any given frequency. However, not everyone can afford a spectrum analyzer or has access to one. Fortunately it is possible to use an application like SDR# with your receiver to determine how strong or weak various received signals actually are and the impact they might be having on performance.</p>



<p>Here is an example of signal measurement with <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">the RTL-SDR</a> as viewed in SDR#. The two views shown are the FFT view and the waterfall or spectrogram below it.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="593" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FM-before-1024x593.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FM-before-1024x593.jpg 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FM-before-300x174.jpg 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FM-before-768x445.jpg 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FM-before.jpg 1916w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>FM signals measured with <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">the RTL-SDR</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>As you experiment with different antennas and other components below, tune across the frequency range of <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">the RTL-SDR</a> to check out various signals and their strengths in the waterfall view. This will give you an idea of how your changes impact performance. It will for instance tell you approximately how much gain you need to add up front. It will also tell you if you actually need any amplification at all. In general avoid doing anything that increases the <strong><span>RED</span></strong> levels as these are very strong signals. </p>



<p>Now let’s take a look at the various parts of the ADS-B system and how they impact performance.</p>



<h2>Antennas</h2>



<p>The antenna is at the very front-end of your ADS-B system. You will need an effective <a href="https://amzn.to/3cyPXNr">antenna for ADS-B</a> as it is key to good signal reception. As is often said, garbage in, garbage out. If you use a lousy antenna, a good receiver isn’t going to compensate for it. You can read our complete <a href="https://www.onesdr.com/2020/04/19/best-antennas-for-ads-b-reception/">review of ADS-B antennas</a>. The best antenna requires some effort for installation and optimization but it’s well worth the time spent. </p>



<h2>RF Cables</h2>



<p>If you’re looking to mount your antenna on your rooftop or on a tower for better reception, you will need to take the length of the RF cable from the antenna to your ADS-B receiver into consideration. Why is that?</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop-1024x576.png" alt="" width="553" height="311" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px"><figcaption>Installing an Antenna on your Rooftop</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As the frequency of the signal increases, so do the signal losses or attenuation due to any given length of cable. For instance, if you were to use <a href="https://amzn.to/36DJJcj">LMR-400 cable</a>, the loss at 30 MHz is only 0.7 dB for every 100 ft of cable. For the same length of cable, the loss at 1090 MHz is around 4 dB. This signal loss directly impacts the sensitivity of the system by 4 dB and therefore reduces the range of your ADS-B receiver by more than half relative to if you were to use a very short length of cable. That is quite significant.</p>



<h2>Amplifiers</h2>



<p>Fortunately there is a way to compensate for this degradation in sensitivity due to cable loss. It involves the use of a low noise amplifier (LNA). In general, any LNA with sufficiently low noise figure (typically less than 1 dB) and the required amount of gain can be used. </p>



<p>So the first question is – what is the required gain? </p>



<p>The answer depends on several factors some of which are:</p>



<ul><li>Amount of cable loss at 1090 MHz</li><li>Other RF signals are present in your environment – in particular strong ones</li><li>The dynamic and operating range of your ADS-B receiver</li></ul>



<p>As discussed, cable loss can be overcome with the use of an LNA. However, an LNA will amplify everything within its range of operation. It will amplify AM, FM and other signals. Consider a situation where an FM signal is stronger than the ADS-B signal of interest. The amplified signal will saturate the receiver if it exceeds the dynamic range. The signal will also possibly damage the receiver if you’re operating at signal levels that exceed the range of the receiver. The receiver will not be able to process the ADS-B signal of interest in either case.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1-1024x576.png" alt="Block diagram showing ADS-B signal amplified" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Amplifying an ADS-B signal</figcaption></figure>



<p>A solution to this problem is to use a Filtered LNA. This is an LNA with a filter integrated along with it as shown in the picture below.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2-1024x576.png" alt="Filtered LNA for ADS-B" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Filtered Low Noise Amplifier for ADS-B</figcaption></figure>



<p>The LNA is usually the first component and it is followed by a filter specific to the band of interest – in this case 1090 MHz for ADS-B. This product will reject all signals outside the ADS-B frequency range. For instance it will reject strong FM signals, 4G signals from cellular base stations, signals at 2.4 GHz from your Wi-Fi access point and more. </p>



<p>Here are a couple of ADS-B filtered LNAs that will work depending on your setup.</p>







<p>Use <a href="https://gpio.com/collections/filtered-low-noise-amplifier/products/ads-b-filtered-dual-low-noise-amplifier-lna-with-30-db-gain">this Filtered LNA with 30 dB gain</a> if you have a very long cable run and need to compensate for significant signal loss. Using the calculation for LMR400 above, this Filtered LNA can compensate for 700 ft of cable loss. </p>



<p>Use <a href="https://gpio.com/collections/filtered-low-noise-amplifier/products/ads-b-filtered-low-noise-amplifier-lna-with-15-db-gain">this Filtered LNA that provides 15 dB gain</a>, if you have a shorter cable run. </p>



<h3><strong>How to Install an LNA</strong></h3>



<p>It is best to place the LNA very close to the antenna. This will help minimize the noise figure and improve the sensitivity of your ADS-B receiver system. Since it’s difficult to get a power source or supply at the top of an antenna, <a href="https://www.onesdr.com/2020/01/19/what-is-a-bias-tee/">a bias tee system</a> can be used. A bias tee at the receiver is used to send the DC voltage up to the LNA over the RF cable connecting the two. At the LNA there is a reciprocal bias tee that splits the DC and RF signals. The DC is used to power the LNA. The block diagram below shows a situation where the SDR has a built-in bias tee. This is indeed the case with <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">the RTL-SDR</a>.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bias-tee-modules-1-1024x576.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bias-tee-modules-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bias-tee-modules-1-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bias-tee-modules-1-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bias-tee-modules-1.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Use a Bias Tee to Power a Remote LNA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Sometimes when an LNA is connected the results look like in the following picture – amazing results with a tripling of the number of planes observed!</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="940" height="529" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-improvement.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-improvement.jpg 940w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-improvement-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-improvement-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px"><figcaption>Improvement in Number of Planes Tracked</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At other times, the addition of an LNA degrades performance and you will not be able to see any airplanes. Why does this happen? Let’s assume that your LNA is connected properly with the RF input end connected to the antenna and that it is powered correctly. There are then two possibilities:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Too much cable loss</strong> and the amount of LNA gain cannot help overcome this degradation. In this situation more gain is required and you can simply add another LNA. Remember to place the first LNA as close to the antenna as possible so as to minimize noise figure. Remember also to check signal levels so you can adjust the amplitude to be within the optimal range. </li><li><strong>Too much gain </strong>and you are likely saturating your receiver with strong signals. Note that even when using a filtered LNA, if the FM signals in your area are very strong, the out-of-band attenuation due to the filter might not be adequate to prevent receiver saturation. Once again you can check what’s going on with the spectrum analyzer view in SDR#. </li></ul>



<h3><strong>How to Optimize the Signal Levels into the RTL-SDR</strong></h3>



<p>There are three methods by which you can optimize signal levels going into the RTL-SDR after the addition of a Filtered LNA.</p>



<p>In the event that you have strong out-of-band signals, they should be attenuated to a reasonable level. The easiest way to do this is by adding an additional <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/gpio/ads-b-bandpass-filter-band-pass-1090-mhz-ads-b/">ADS-B bandpass filter</a> after the Filtered LNA.</p>



<p>Another way to optimize gain is to reduce the signal level across the band with an attenuator. Connect <a href="https://amzn.to/2K4a4IY">an inline fixed attenuator</a> to the output of the LNA. You can experiment with different values such as 30 dB, 20 dB, etc. until you start seeing output by way of planes. </p>







<p>The third method is to adjust the gain in the Flightaware stick digitally. The <a href="https://amzn.to/3f4pJUk">FlightAware</a> stick is essentially an <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">RTL-SDR</a> and utilizes an R802T chipset. Below is a block diagram of the R802T.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/R820T-block-1024x689.png" alt="" width="540" height="363" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/R820T-block-1024x689.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/R820T-block-300x202.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/R820T-block-768x517.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/R820T-block.png 1498w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px"><figcaption>R802T Architecture</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As you can see the user has the ability to modify the Variable Gain Amplifier (VGA). The range over which this can be varied is nearly 50 dB. The <a href="https://amzn.to/3f4pJUk">FlightAware</a> powers up with maximum amplification in the system. So you essentially have to adjust it to a point where you get the best reception. <a href="https://discussions.flightaware.com/t/for-beginners-how-to-set-change-gain/30201">Here are instructions on how to modify the gain</a>. </p>



<p>Many experiments have been conducted and reported on the <a href="https://amzn.to/3f4pJUk">FlightAware</a> discussion site. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://discussions.flightaware.com/t/gain-adjustment/18376/7" target="_blank">Here is one such discussion</a>. In the plot below, user BartJr has reported an improvement in reception with increase in amplification.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="777" height="392" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rtl-vga-inc.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rtl-vga-inc.png 777w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rtl-vga-inc-300x151.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rtl-vga-inc-768x387.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"><figcaption>Reception Varies with VGA Gain</figcaption></figure></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Two days ago, macOS users experienced worrying hangs when opening applications not downloaded from the Mac App Store. Many users suspected hardware issues with their devices, but as they took to social media, they found it was a widespread problem. And it was no coincidence that it was happening so soon after the launch of macOS “Big Sur”.</p>

<p>Eventually, <a href="https://twitter.com/lapcatsoftware/status/1326990296412991489">a tweet by Jeff Johnson</a> pinpointed the underlying issue. Apple’s “OCSP Responder” service was overloaded, therefore macOS was unable to verify app developers’ cryptographic certificates.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cryptohack.org/assets/images/apple-tweet.png?style=centerme" alt="Jeff Johnson's tweet"></p>

<p>But why are OCSP Responders in the critical path of apps launching? This post will briefly discuss code signing, how Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) works, why it’s deeply flawed, and what are some better alternatives. Unlike other posts on this incident, I want to emphasise the practical crypto aspects (at a high level) and offer a balanced perspective.</p>

<h3 id="code-signing">Code Signing</h3>

<p>On their developer portal, Apple explain <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/code-signing/">the purpose of code signing</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Code signing your app assures users that it is from a known source and the app hasn’t been modified since it was last signed. Before your app can integrate app services, be installed on a device, or be submitted to the App Store, it must be signed with a certificate issued by Apple.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, if developers want their apps to be trusted on macOS, they must sign them using their own certificate keypair. Keychain is used to generate a unique “Developer ID” certificate, which includes a private key for the developer to use, and a public key for distribution. After Apple have signed the Developer ID certificate, the developer can use the private key to produce cryptographic signatures on their apps as part of their release process.</p>

<p>When you run an app, its signature is verified against the public key of the developer’s certificate. Then, the certificate itself is verified, by checking that it hasn’t expired yet (certificates are typically valid for 1 year), and that it’s ultimately signed by Apple’s root certificate. There may also be intermediate certificates as part of the chain up to the root certificate. A “chain of trust” has been created, because the developer ID certificate signed an app, an intermediate certificate signed the developer ID certificate, and Apple’s root certificate signed the intermediate certificate. Any Apple device can verify this chain of trust and therefore approve an app to run.</p>

<p>This is similar to the TLS Public Key Infrastructure used on the internet. But it’s also fundamentally different since Apple has total control over its own chain of trust. Other certificate authorities are not allowed to issue valid certificates for code signing as all certificates must chain back up to Apple.</p>

<p>If the verification process wasn’t successful, then users will see a scary dialogue which is difficult to bypass:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cryptohack.org/assets/images/apple-failed-verify.png?style=centerme" alt="Apple failed to verify popup"></p>

<h3 id="revocation">Revocation</h3>

<p>What happens when a developer is found to be breaching Apple’s rules, or loses control of their private key? A certificate authority needs to be able to instantly nullify bad certificates they’ve issued. If a certificate is being used maliciously, it’s not acceptable to wait days or months until it expires naturally, otherwise a leak of a high-profile private key would render the whole system useless.</p>

<p>This is where certificate revocation comes in. It’s an additional step in the signature verification process, which involves finding out from the certificate authority if a certificate is still valid.</p>

<p>Originally, at least on the web, this was done the simplest way you can imagine. The certificate authority would give you a Certificate Revocation List (CRL), containing serial numbers of all revoked certificates, and you could check the certificate you are currently verifying is not on the list. However, this approach stopped being used by web browsers since the list got longer and longer and failed to scale. Especially after terrifying exploits like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed">Heartbleed</a> demanded mass revocation of certificates.</p>

<p>Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is an alternative allowing real-time checking of certificates. Each certificate can include a baked-in “OCSP Responder”, a URL that you can query that will report whether the certificate has been revoked. In Apple’s case, that’s “ocsp.apple.com”. So now, in addition to verifying the cryptographic validity of the signature, each time you launch an app you’re performing a real-time check with Apple (subject to some caching) to ensure they still think the developer’s ID certificate is legitimate.</p>

<h3 id="ocsps-availability-problem">OCSP’s Availability Problem</h3>

<p>There’s a huge problem with OCSP: it makes an external service a single point of failure. What happens if the OCSP Responder is down or unreachable? Do we just refuse to verify the certificate (hard-fail)? Or do we pretend that the check was successful (soft-fail)?</p>

<p>Apple are forced to use the soft-fail behaviour, otherwise apps wouldn’t work when you’re offline. As it happens, all major browsers also implement the soft-fail behaviour, since OCSP Responders have traditionally been unreliable, and browsers want to keep displaying websites even if certificate authorities’ responders are temporarily down.</p>

<p>But soft-fail isn’t great, because it means that an attacker with network control can block requests to the responder, and the revocation check will be skipped. In fact, that was the hotfix widely shared on Twitter during this incident: blackhole traffic to “ocsp.apple.com” by adding a line to <em>/etc/hosts</em>. A lot of people won’t be removing that line anytime soon, since disabling OCSP doesn’t cause any noticeable problems.</p>

<h3 id="the-incident">The Incident</h3>

<p>If Apple’s OCSP check was built to soft-fail, then why did apps hang when the OCSP Responder was down? Probably because this was actually a different failure case: the OCSP Responder was not completely down, it was performing badly.</p>

<p>Due to the load added by millions of users worldwide upgrading to macOS “Big Sur”, Apple’s servers slowed to a crawl, and although they weren’t properly answering OCSP queries, they were working just enough that the soft-fail didn’t trigger.</p>

<h3 id="ocsps-privacy-problem">OCSP’s Privacy Problem</h3>

<p>In addition to OCSP’s availability problems, the protocol wasn’t initially designed with privacy in mind. A basic OCSP query involves an unencrypted HTTP request to the OCSP Responder with the serial number of the certificate. Therefore not only can the responder figure out what certificate you are interested in, but so can your ISP and anybody else intercepting packets. Apple could use this to build a timeline of which developers’ apps you are opening, as could third parties.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cryptohack.org/assets/images/apple-ocsp-wireshark.jpg?style=centerme" alt="OCSP packet in wireshark"></p>

<p>Adding encryption is possible, and there’s a better, more private version called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCSP_stapling">OCSP stapling</a>, but Apple is not using either of these things. In fact OSCP stapling wouldn’t make sense in this scenario, but it illustrates how OCSP needs improvements to not leak data by default.</p>

<h3 id="a-better-future">A Better Future</h3>

<p>This incident has started a lively debate in the software community, with one side proclaiming <a href="https://sneak.berlin/20201112/your-computer-isnt-yours/">“Your Computer Isn’t Yours”</a> and the other arguing that <a href="https://www.security-embedded.com/blog/2020/11/14/application-trust-is-hard-but-apple-does-it-well">“application trust is hard but Apple does it well”</a>. This post aims to show that whichever side you agree with, OCSP is a terrible way to manage certificate revocation, and will lead to more availability and privacy incidents in future. In my opinion, it was a poor engineering decision for Apple to make app launching dependent on OCSP. In the short term at least they have mitigated the damage by <a href="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/ocsp.html">increasing the time that responses are cached</a>.</p>

<p>Fortunately, a better revocation method is reaching maturity. CRLite is a way to shrink down lists of all revoked certificates to a reasonable size. <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/crlite-finally-a-fix-for-broken-revocation/">Scott Helme’s blog</a> gives a good summary of how CRLite uses Bloom Filters to make the Certificate Revocation List approach – which OCSP superseded – feasible again.</p>

<p>Theoretically, macOS devices could pull updates to this list periodically and do certificate revocation checking on the device itself, addressing the availability and privacy problems with OCSP. On the other hand, since the list of revoked Developer ID certificates is much smaller than the list of all revoked PKI certificates, it’s worth asking why Apple haven’t opted to use CRLs in the first place. Perhaps they don’t want to reveal any information about which certificates they’ve revoked.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Overall, the incident this week was a good time to reflect on the trust model that has been promoted by organisations like Apple and Microsoft. Malware has grown in sophistication and most people aren’t in a position to judge whether it’s safe to run particular binaries. Code signing seems like a neat way to leverage cryptography to determine whether or not to trust applications, and to at least associate apps with known developers. And revocation is a necessary part of maintaining that trust.</p>

<p>However, by adding several mundane failure modes to the verification process, OCSP spoils any cryptographic elegance the code signing and verifying process has. While OCSP is also widely used for TLS certificates on the internet, the large number of PKI certificate authorities and relaxed attitude of browsers means that failures are less catastrophic. Moreover, people are accustomed to seeing websites become unavailable from time to time, but they don’t expect the same from apps on their own devices. macOS users were alarmed at how their apps could become collateral damage for an infrastructure issue at Apple. Yet this was an inevitable outcome arising from the fact that certificate verification depends on external infrastructure, and no infrastructure is 100% reliable.</p>

<p>Scott Helme also has concerns about the power that Certificate Authorities gain when certification revocation actually works effectively. Even if you aren’t bothered about the potential for censorship, there will be occasional mistakes and these must be weighed against the security benefits. As one developer discovered when <a href="https://blog.charliemonroe.net/a-day-without-business/">Apple mistakenly revoked his certificate</a>, …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>In his video message on his prayer intention for November, Pope Francis emphasizes that progress in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) be oriented “towards respecting the dignity of the person and of Creation”.</p><div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p><b><i>By Vatican News staff writer</i></b></p> 
<p>During the month of November, Pope Francis draws our attention to the epochal change that humanity is experiencing thanks to advances in artificial intelligence. &nbsp;He, therefore, invites us to pray that this progress always “serve humankind,” respecting human dignity and taking care of Creation.</p> 
<h2><b>True progress</b></h2> 
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made exponential advances, as evidenced by its many applications in different fields of knowledge. Today, 37% of organizations in the world have implemented AI in some way (which represents a 270% increase in the past four years).</p> 
<p>In “<a href="https://thepopevideo.org/" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">The Pope Video</a>” this month, Pope Francis clarifies that this progress in robotics and AI “can make a better world possible if it is joined to the common good.” &nbsp;In this sense, he hopes for technological progress that does not increase the inequalities in society.&nbsp; If it does, the Pope says, it will not be “true progress”.&nbsp; Such progress does not take into account the dignity of the human person and care for Creation.</p> 
<h2><b>Benefits</b></h2> 
<p>AI is capable of addressing many problems facing humanity, such as in evaluating the learning capacity of students, in order to detect opportunities for improvement.&nbsp; It can help people with visual or hearing impairments by developing better communication tools (such as converting text to speech or speech to text).&nbsp; AI can also speed up the collection, processing and diffusion of health data to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients, especially those living in remote areas.</p> 
<p>The same applies to the field of ecology. Through AI, it is possible to analyze data on climate change and create models that can help predict natural disasters. It can also be used to create intelligent and sustainable cities by reducing urban spending, improving the resilience of highways and increasing energy efficiency.&nbsp; There are vast possibilities for using this technological progress for the common good, and “The Pope Video” uses images from the Italian Institute of Technology and the Italian multinational energy company, Enel, to show some of these benefits.</p> 
<h2><b>Serving humanity&nbsp;</b></h2> 
<p>“Innovation,” says Enel’s CEO, Francesco Starace, “has placed at our disposition extraordinary tools that we need to be capable of using in the best possible way.”&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He continues, “As Pope Francis reaffirms, it is our task to ensure that the resulting benefits are distributed fairly and create opportunities and wellbeing.” Starace says, “In order to give a positive orientation to our actions and choices regarding the present and the future, we must put respect for people and for the environment at the centre, adopting a vision based on sustainability. Only in this way can technological evolution be an ally of humanity and create opportunities which, up until a few years ago, we couldn’t even imagine.”</p> 
<p>The Pope’s <a href="https://www.popesprayer.va/" rel="external">Worldwide Prayer Network</a> is responsible for the diffusion of the Pope’s monthly prayer intentions. &nbsp;In comments on the Holy Father’s prayer intention for November, the network’s international director, Jesuit Father Frédéric Fornos also speaks of the need to channel these rapid technological changes for the “good of all.”</p> 
<p>“This month’s prayer intention,” he says, “reinforces the idea that the benefit that humanity has obtained (and will continue to obtain) from technological progress must always take into account as well, and in parallel, ‘adequate development of responsibility and values’.”&nbsp; This, Fr Fornos says, has been underscored by the Pope in his encyclical <i>Laudato si’ </i>and now in his third encyclical, <i>Fratelli tutti,</i> where he says, “How wonderful it would be if the growth of scientific and technological innovation could come with more equality and social inclusion!”</p> 
<p>AI, robotics, and other applications of technology, says Fr Fornos, open great challenges for ethics and social justice. “This is why the Pope’s most recent petition is important: to pray that this progress will always ‘be human.’”</p> 
<p><b>The text of the November 2020 prayer intention:</b></p> 
<p><i>Artificial intelligence is at the heart of the epochal change we are experiencing.&nbsp; Robotics can make a better world possible if it is joined to the common good.&nbsp; Indeed, if technological progress increases inequalities, it is not true progress.&nbsp; Future advances should be oriented towards respecting the dignity of the person and of Creation.&nbsp;</i></p> 
<p><i>Let us pray that the progress of robotics and artificial intelligence may always serve humankind… we could say, may it “be human.”</i><br> </p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <h4>What is the demo doing?</h4>
        <p>Neural networks achieve superhuman performance in many areas, but they are easily fooled.</p>
        <p>In the demo above, we can force neural networks to predict anything we want. By adding nearly-invisible noise to an image, we turn "1"s into "9"s, "Stop" signs into "120 km/hr" signs, and dogs into hot dogs.</p>
        <p>These noisy images are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversarial_machine_learning#Specific_Attacks_Types">adversarial examples</a>. They break the integrity of machine learning systems, and the illusion of their superhuman performance.</p>

        <h4>Why does this matter?</h4>
        <p>Our world is becoming increasingly automated, yet these systems have strange failure modes.</p>
        <p>If machine learning systems are not properly defended, attackers could:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Impersonate others in facial recognition systems</li>
          <li>Force autonomous vehicles to misrecognize street signs &amp; obstacles</li>
          <li>Bypass content moderation and spam filters in social networks</li>
          <li>Inject adversarial bytes into malware to bypass antivirus systems</li>
          <li>Digitally alter numbers on a check in a mobile banking app</li>
          <li>(and more)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Is this limited to image classification with neural networks?</h4>
        <p>No. Adversarial examples exist for almost every machine learning task: <a href="https://nicholas.carlini.com/code/audio_adversarial_examples">speech recognition</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.07998.pdf">text classification</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3308558.3313533">fraud detection</a>, <a href="https://www.ericswallace.com/imitation">machine translation</a>, <a href="https://adversarialpolicies.github.io/">reinforcement learning</a>, ....</p>
        <p>Moreover, all machine learning models (not just neural networks) are vulnerable. In fact, simpler models such as logistic regression are <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6572.pdf">even more easily attacked</a>.</p>
        <p>Finally – beyond adversarial examples – there are many more adversarial attack vectors, including data poisoning, model backdooring, data extraction, and model stealing.</p>

        <h4>How do I defend against adversarial examples?</h4>
        <p>There are several proposed defenses, including adversarial training and admission control.</p>
        <p>However, no defense is universal and many have proven ineffective, so work with an expert to quantify your risks and invest in defenses appropriately.</p>
        <p>(What happens if someone can make your system predict anything they want?).</p>

        <h4>Where can I learn more?</h4>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><h3>Getting Things Done</h3><p><time datetime="2020-11-09"><small>9 Nov, 2020</small></time></p><p>I'm writing this blog post at 21:45 on a weekday after an intense day at work and a full evening of looking after my daughter and cooking pizza. I was in three video conferences and chatted with two colleagues in Teams, all while having my kid run around me all day because the daycare is closed. Now's the time to do something for <strong>me</strong>. Wouldn't it be nice to have some help to juggle all these different things and not feel overwhelmed?</p><p>In the next weeks, I'm trying out the Getting Things Done (GTD for short) method. I have tried GTD for short periods off and on over some years. Without knowing the concept, I used <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things">Things</a> but abandoned it after some time. That was over 10 years in my studies. A few years back, I read the original book and re-read it last year. So why try again? Didn't I learn my lesson?</p><p>No - I didn't :-). Although I've never completely adopted it, I've soaked up more and more of its practices. This time around I'll try to apply <em>all</em> its techniques as well as I can and see where that leads me.</p><h2 id="gtd-in-a-nutshell">GTD in a nutshell</h2><p>Quoted with small changes from the book:</p><ol><li>Capture all the things that might need to get done or have usefulness for you - now, later, someday, big little, or in between -- in a logical and trusted system outside your head and off your mind.</li><li>Direct yourself to make front-end decisions about all of the "inputs" you let into your life so that you will always have a workable inventory of "next actions" that you can implement or renegotiate in the moment.</li><li>Curate and coordinate all of that content, utilizing the recognition of the multiple levels of commitments with yourself and others you will have at play at any point in time.</li></ol><p>There are already many concise and complete introductions to the basics of GTD, so I won't repeat them here. Read <a href="https://hamberg.no/gtd">Erlend Hamberg's well-structured one: GTD in 15 minutes</a>. It's a quick and well-written guide.</p><p>In a sense, GTD is very American because I have the feeling (North) Americans are obsessed with lists. Many clickbait articles you come across have titles like "top X things" where X is more often than not simply the number somebody came up with. Although I must admit the last example was from a German site <a href="https://t3n.de/news/wordpress-hosting-anbieter-vergleich-604474/">13 WordPress-Anbieter</a>.</p><p>GTD has a list of the next actions one wants to look at. This is different from a todo list in that there are stricter rules on what a good entry can be. For example, it has to be a physical action and not a whole project. GTD also prescribes reviews (every day and every week) to keep on top of these lists. There's a comfort to know you'll triage a pressing question or inspiring article the next day or at least at your weekly review. This relief is at the heart of GTD: knowing that nothing will fall through the cracks you can relax from time to time.</p><p>One pays for a generally more relaxed general outlook by following a couple of small practices very closely. To capture all things, David Allen means that all emails or collected snippets are processed and collected too. I found it especially significant that one should collect references and notes on everything that might come in handy later. Collecting things comes <strong>very</strong> naturally to me; as a kid, I liked to collect buttons -- of all things -- and to keep many books around. When at long last I got my own computer I immediately started collecting <em>all the things</em>. My <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> accounts probably had more than a thousand collected links when it was shut down. GTD emphasizes to collect references for later usage. A lot of input is not useful at the moment and only potentially later at some point, but still, you can rely on your system to keep it for you.</p><h2 id="is-gtd-for-everybody%3F">Is GTD for everybody?</h2><p>David Allen originally "discovered" it in his work as a consultant and executive coach. I would argue that it's useful when you're already pretty organized. If you're in a routine job with little need for interaction with others it might be overkill for you. A simple todo list and some basic tricks to fight procrastination could be enough. There are fewer and fewer routine jobs. Most office workers are expected to be as "agile" when shifting many responsibilities as executives two decades ago.</p><h2 id="besides-gtd">Besides GTD</h2><p>In summary, I've mentioned that a convenient "setup" serves me better than vague "hacks". It can increase motivation and/or remove distractions. For my productivity, I still find it crucial to avoid news sites as much as possible. I've replaced them with a collection of RSS feeds from newspapers and some blogs. With a configured update interval of four hours, refreshing it every few minutes is less attractive. Turning off communication tools, the popular Pomodoro technique or simply walking to another room, still help me. I like that you can still apply many other ideas and still refine my <em>personal</em> system. If I had <strong>nothing</strong> to procrastinate on, that would be sad too, right?</p><p>I think getting rid of distractions is more important than having the perfect productivity system/todo tool. Cal Newport's ideas from his books (especially <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/">"Deep Work"</a> and <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/">"Digital Minimalism"</a>) and his <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/blog/">blog</a> immediately come to mind. <a href="https://www.taniarascia.com/everyday-systems/">Here are some ideas from developer Tania Rascia</a> that I can relate to.</p><h2 id="how-to-implement-gtd">How to Implement GTD</h2><p>You have to decide if you want to go analog or digital. David Allen suggests in his book to keep lists and folders analog first. Digital tools realize GTD with more or less sophistication. I've never tried to use only paper although I tried working a lot with my Moleskine notebook. At some point, I had also used Things but only used it as a fancy todo list.</p><p>For me a very text-centric simple note-taking app called <a href="https://nvultra.com/">nvUltra</a> has worked well. It lets me write lists in different files synced between my laptop and smartphone. It's not very adapted to GTD but I like that it is an excellent reference system too. nvUltra is the commercial successor to the excellent open-source <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/">nvAlt</a>. This in turn evolved from <a href="http://notational.net/">Notational Velocity</a>. There are also cross-platform implementations such as <a href="https://github.com/cpbotha/nvpy">nvPY</a>.</p><p><a href="https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/getting-things-done">todoist</a> is a sophisticated tool for GTD too. <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a> has been around very long and has been refreshed over time. Other general-purpose note-taking tools can be adapted for GTD too, such as Evernote, Notion, or OneNote. <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org-mode</a> is an alternative plain text file format that's more powerful than Markdown. It's mostly used with the Emacs editor and supports notes and todos as well.</p><h2 id="gtd-horizons">GTD horizons</h2><p>One distinguishing feature of GTD on top of todo management is more abstract and longer-term levels of focus. rom the day-to-day "ground" level, David Allen introduces the level of longer projects at horizon 1 and goes up to the purpose of your life with horizon 5. In his <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/2015/05/podcast-01-david-allen-talks-about-the-new-edition-of-getting-things-done/">podcast</a>, David Allen mentions that for many it takes years to reach these longer-term perspectives. It takes a long time to integrate them into the system. He suggests one should start off with the day-to-day and form long-term plans bottom-up.</p><p>GTD horizons with their increased abstraction remind me of Eastern religions such as buddhism. In stoicism as well one works towards a very distant ideal of "enlightenment". This is not far-fetched as David Allen is a black belt karateka and used his experience in the conception of GTD. The book mentions having a "mind like water" to be ready for anything that may come to you as a concept from martial arts. There's also a blog by David Allen with <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/2019/05/10-reasons-gtd-is-like-karate/">10 more similarities</a>.</p><h2 id="is-it-simply-self-exploitation%3F">Is it Simply Self-Exploitation?</h2><p>"Increasing productivity" also has a stale 19th century factory worker exploitation aspect to me. At least the basis of management "science" had very questionable origins. Managers "scientifically" noted how long some workers took to complete a task. They noted the fastest and decided to increase work quotas for everybody. Even then short-term exploitation didn't have long-term lasting positive effects.</p><p>One could argue that a personal productivity system only serves as self-exploitation. Where managers exploited industrial workers, we do it ourselves now. I haven't read or though much about this, but a <a href="https://dev.to/tinmanjk/the-curious-case-of-self-exploitation--303j">dev article by Ivan Petrov raises some interesting points</a>. They emphasize:</p><blockquote><p>What I have learned and forgotten and re-learned is that the power NOT to do (negative potency) seems to be the only weapon.</p></blockquote><p>This at least we can take to heart by filtering out many actions. We can also try to move away from "outside" areas of (work) focus and focus on our own values and vision.</p><h2 id="trial-period">Trial Period</h2><p>For the next month until December 6th, I'm implementing GTD and revisiting its techniques. For me some questions still remain unanswered:</p><ul><li>When to "uncover" the following project "next action"? As soon as a previous one is done? At the daily or weekly review?</li><li>Should I track project "next actions" in the same list of individual "next actions"? Wouldn't this create a lot of extra overhead to copy tasks from files to files?</li><li>Can I effectively attach project and action reference material with my bare-bones plain-text system? nvUltra doesn't have support to easily attach images or other files.</li><li>Should I keep some references available for all completed actions for later reference?</li><li>Are the tickler files something I can implement digitally? Should I use it for habits and routines?</li><li>Will I have the discipline to postpone work tasks (that often overwhelm my todo list)?</li><li>Should I copy information from other tracking tools that I use with others, e.g. JIRA?</li><li>How exactly to keep track of deadlines (with tickler files or also in projects)?</li><li>Should I handle personal or professional tasks differently after all?</li><li>What are my higher horizons like "areas of responsibility", "objectives", "vision" and "purpose"?</li></ul><h2 id="references">References</h2><ul><li><a href="https://forum.gettingthingsdone.com/">Official GTD Forum</a></li></ul><h3 id="overview%2Fintroduction">Overview/Introduction</h3><ul><li><a href="https://hamberg.no/gtd">GTD in 15 minutes</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done</a></li><li><a href="https://www.43folders.com/2004/09/08/getting-started-with-getting-things-done">Merlin Mann's Intro with further links</a></li></ul><h3 id="references-2">References</h3><ul><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190602235428/http://wiki.43folders.com:80/index.php/GTD">Merlin Mann's wiki via Wayback Machine</a></li></ul><h3 id="scientific-evaluation">Scientific Evaluation</h3><ul><li><a href="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/GTD-cognition.pdf">"Getting Things Done: The Science behind Stress-Free Productivity"</a></li></ul></article></div>]]>

  <blockquote>
<p>Mr. Bezos. I’m all in favor of a clean fulfillment center, but tell me: Why do you sweep? Why do you not instead eliminate the source of dirt? - Unknown “insultant”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does DevOps pass the “so what?” test? When you start to follow the history of DevOps from Agile, Lean, TOS, TQM, TPS, and beyond; doesn’t it lead to plain old critical thinking? Is it anything special? If it’s so simple, if anyone can do it, then why on earth would the worlds richest person <a href="https://youtu.be/O4MtQGRIIuA?t=1250">pay an “insultant” to teach him</a>? Jeff seems to understand that eliminating waste is important, that you should never pass a defect down the line, but he seems to discard the sweeping question as too abstract, and not useful.</p>
<p>Las Cruces Public Schools (LCPS) may be a perfect example of an organization that’s proud of their ability to <a href="https://www.lcsun-news.com/story/news/education/lcps/2020/11/14/las-cruces-public-schools-what-ransomware-attack-taught-us/6296955002/">scale up sweeping operations in response to a ransomware incident</a>. Why are they so proud of their investment of resources, to deal with ransomware? <a href="http://www.lcps.net/district-overview/">How does that support their mission</a>? Who’s their customer? Ransomware? If DevOps is just critical thinking and LCPS’ value statement is “<a href="http://www.lcps.net/district-overview/">our expectation is that our schools are diverse, equitable, and provide opportunities for the development of critical thinking and democratic ideals</a>”, then shouldn’t we hold them accountable for critical thinking?</p>
<p>Nobody gravitates towards DevOps when everything is working. DevOps isn’t valuable in environments where waste is cheap, it’s valuable where waste isn’t cheap. I’d have to think it’s valuable in any public school system that’s struggling to meet demand within their budget. Maybe it’s too late to help LCPS avoid ransomware, but maybe we can help another school system through a little critical thinking exercise.</p>
<p>Most of what people assume is “DevOps” is just repackaged teaching from an Isreali physicist who wrote a book for the business world in 1984. That book, The Goal, <a href="https://slate.com/business/2012/06/the-goal-eli-goldratts-gripping-thriller-about-operations-theory.html">is still popular in business schools</a>. If there’s one thing Eliyahu Goldratt, the author of The Goal, consistently talks about in all of his teaching, it’s understanding cause and effect. Goldratt advocates for the use of what he calls <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_reality_tree_(theory_of_constraints)">Current Reality Tree</a> (CRT) to map out the cause and effect of a problem, the conflict, and where to focus resources on resolution.</p>
<p>Let’s try it out with Ransomware, it may look something like this if we simply map out the cause and effect relationships of what we know about a <a href="https://thedfirreport.com/2020/11/05/ryuk-speed-run-2-hours-to-ransom/">ransomware incident</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericalexander.org/20201115-crt-1.png" alt="simple cause and effect"></p>
<p>Make sense? Now let’s look at a full current reality tree, where we go beyond the ransomware incident, and start to look at how a ransomware opportunity was created.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericalexander.org/20201115-crt-2.png" alt="full crt">
<a href="https://ericalexander.org/20201115-crt-2.png">Full Image</a></p>
<p>It balloons out when we start to understand all the vectors of how they get on our network, and what they do, once they get there.</p>
<p>Vectors:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://thedfirreport.com/2020/11/05/ryuk-speed-run-2-hours-to-ransom/">Phishing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/security-world/business-security-world/2018/08/protect-rdp-access-ransomware-attacks/">Perimeter System: Compromised Credentials</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/black-kingdom-ransomware-hacks-networks-with-pulse-vpn-flaws/">Perimeter System: Missing Patch</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Once they get on the network they’ll deploy a <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/09/24/cobalt_strike_cisco_talos/">command and control</a> (C&amp;C) tool that enables them to drop additional tools and start hunting domain admins. They’ll search for servers or computers <a href="https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound">where they can login, and where the domain admin is logged in</a>. Once they find that system they grab either the domain admin’s password, or their session information (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_the_hash">just as good as a password</a>), then it’s game over. They now have keys to the kingdom and can delete backups and encrypt systems.</p>
<p>Now that you know how it works, and the cause and effect: Did LCPS eliminate the source of dirt?</p>
<p>This is the only statement that covers what they learned, and how they changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since then, we have installed firewalls, updated our systems, invested in our teachers and improved our infrastructure so we can protect ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we go back to our current reality tree we can ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does a firewall address the conflict points? It’s not clear if they’re talking about a new fancy next-gen perimeter firewall, improved network segregation, or host firewalls. Segregation and host firewalls could help if they prevent the bad actor from logging into a shared system where domain admin is logged in.</li>
<li>Was the problem updated systems? Possible vector if they’re not patching, but it doesn’t address the core conflict.</li>
<li>Invested in our teachers and improved our infrastructure. Great. Keep it up, but it still doesn’t address the core conflict.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the core conflict:</p>
<p><img src="https://ericalexander.org/20201115-crt-3.png" alt="core conflict"></p>
<p>The number of domain admins is the core conflict. It’s rarely necessary to have any domain admins, but most organizations have much more than zero when it’s easier to give somebody domain admin access, than it is to take the time to give them only the access they need to do their job. Plain old Least Privilege. Plain old <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/controlled-use-of-administrative-privileges/">#4 on the CIS Top 20 security controls</a>.</p>
<p>Did LCPS go back and fix the core conflict, or are they still passing a defect downline? What should they have done prior to the Ransomware breach? What can you do now? Evaluate your blast radius. Your InfoSec and/or IT teams should be following the advice of <a href="https://adsecurity.org/">adsecurity.org</a>. They should be running tools like <a href="https://github.com/PlumHound/PlumHound">Plumhound</a> or <a href="https://www.guardicore.com/infectionmonkey/">Infection Monkey</a> to understand and reduce blast radius.</p>
<p>You don’t have to be an IT or InfoSec expert to get a glimpse into your ransomware risk. You’re at less risk, possibly near zero, if your organization isn’t using Active Directory; but if they are, you can run the powershell below from your computer to evaluate blast radius.</p>
<pre><code># This will install AD tools on Windows 10
Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name Rsat.ActiveDirectory.DS-LDS.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0
# This will list all domain admins
Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "Domain Admins" -Recursive | %{Get-ADUser -Identity $_.distinguishedName -properties *} | Select Name, Enabled, LastLogonDate, logonCount, PasswordLastSet
# This will list all enterprise admins
Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "Enterprise Admins" -Recursive | %{Get-ADUser -Identity $_.distinguishedName -properties *} | Select Name, Enabled, LastLogonDate, logonCount, PasswordLastSet
</code></pre>
<p>That powershell will list user accounts ransomware teams are interested in, the ones they’ll go after once they land on your network. Ideally that list is zero. It’s not zero? Shocker! How about passwords? Are they being rotated quickly? Ideally every 7 days or less. What’s the logon count look like? Is it in the hundreds? Ouch, somebody is running around with scissors.</p>
<p>Concerned? Send that output to your IT or InfoSec teams. Ask them if they understand the advice of adsecurity.org or Plumhound. Maybe they have it under control, but maybe they need a little poking to remind them it’s important.</p>
<p>Interested in learning more about the so what of DevOps, and how it applies to Information Security? I’m writing a book. Send me an <a href="https://ericalexander.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#513534273e21227f333e3e3a1134233832303d3429303f3534237f3e23366e2224333b3432256c333e3e3a77303c216a333e35286c1d34257463613c347463613a3f3e267463612639343f746361382576227463613e2425">email</a> or connect on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericalexanderorg">LinkedIn</a> if you’re interested in the book.</p>

<p>The basic installation format for users who install packages via <code>pip</code> is
the wheel format. Wheel names are composed of four parts: a
package-name-and-version tag (which can be further broken down), a Python tag,
an ABI tag, and a platform tag. More information on the tags can be found in
<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0425">PEP 425</a>.  So a package like NumPy
will be available on PyPI as <code>numpy-1.19.2-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl</code> for 64-bit
windows and <code>numpy-1.19.2-cp36-cp36m-macosx_10_9_x86_64.whl</code> for macOS. Note
that only the plaform tag <code>win_amd64</code> or <code>macosx_10_9_x86_64</code> differs. </p>
<p>But what about Linux? There is no single, vendor controlled, "Linux platform"
e.g., Ubuntu, RedHat, Fedora, Debian, FreeBSD all package software at slightly
different versions. What most Linux distributions do have in common is the
glibc runtime library, and a smattering of various additional system libraries.
So it is possible to define a least common denominator (LCD) of software
expected to be on a Linux platform (exceptions apply, e.g. non-glibc
distributions).</p>
<p>The decision to converge on a LCD common platform gave birth to the
<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0513/">manylinux1</a> standard. Going back
to our example, numpy is available as
<code>numpy-1.19.2-cp36-cp36m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl</code>.</p>
<p>The first manylinux standard, manylinux1, was based on CentOS5 which has <a href="https://endoflife.software/operating-systems/linux/centos">been
obsolete</a> since
March 2017. The subsequent manylinux2010 standard is based on CentOS6, which
will hit end-of-life in December 2020. The manylinux2014 standard still has some
breathing room. Based on CentOS7, it will reach end-of-life in July 2024.</p>
<p>So what is next for <code>manylinux</code>, and what <code>manylinux</code> should users and package
maintainers use?</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->

<h3>If <code>manylinux1</code> is obsolete, why are there still manylinux1 wheels?</h3>
<p>Wheels are typically consumed by Pip via <code>pip install</code>. Manylinux wheels are
used for projects that require compilation, otherwise they would ship
pure Python wheels with the "none" platform tag, meaning they are compatible with
any platform. So say you are a library author and want to make it convenient
for users to install your package. If you ship a manylinux2014 wheel, but the
version of Pip your users have is too old to support manylinux2014 wheels, Pip
will happily download the source package and compile it for them. Havoc ensues:
Windows users typically cannot compile, prerequisites will be missing. Pip has
a <code>--only-binary</code> option to prevent it from downloading source code and
compiling, and a <code>--prefer-binary</code> option to prefer older binary packages over
compiling from source, but neither is on by default.</p>
<p>Pip began supporting manylinux2010 wheels with <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/blob/master/NEWS.rst#190-2019-01-22">version
19.0</a>,
released in Jan 2019. The version of Pip that is officially shipped with Python 3.6, via
the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/ensurepip.html">ensurepip</a> module, is
version 18. Python 3.7 ships pip 20. It is easy enough to upgrade, but to be on
the safe side, and prevent havoc, library authors will ship a manylinux1 wheel
for Python 3.6 support.</p>
<h3>What happens now that Python 3.6 is falling out of favor?</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0494">Python 3.6 is no longer in active
development</a>. In fact, the scientific
Python community has decided to stop actively supporting Python 3.6 <a href="https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html#support-table">from
July 2020</a>.
So I would expect to see projects begin to drop the older manylinux1 format,
and drop support for Python 3.6 sooner rather than later, meaning that
<strong><code>manylinux2014</code> may soon become the only option</strong> for new versions.</p>
<h3>What about Conda packages?</h3>
<p>Conda does not use the same kind of wheel format provided by PyPI and Pip. Conda's
build system is internally consistent, and Conda packagers build a binary
package for each supported OS, thus they are not bound to the manylinux
designation. Conda does not have a declared policy around deprecating Python
3.6 yet. Conda does support <code>pip</code> (but try not to mix <code>conda</code> and <code>pip</code>
usage!), and the Pip provided should be version 20 or later. If needed,
<code>conda upgrade pip</code> should get you a modern version, so here too
<code>manylinux2014</code> will soon become the only option.</p>
<h3>What comes after manylinux2014?</h3>
<p>The glibc used in manylinux2014 is defined as the one used by CentOS7. This OS
was released in June 2014. This manylinux standard, for the first time,
declared support for non-x86 hardware systems like ARM64 (aarch64), Power
(ppc64) and S390X.  However the ARM platform has grown greatly since 2014, and
glibc has moved from version 2.17 to 2.31, fixing many bugs. Since the real
driver for platform compatibility is glibc, <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0600/">PEP
600</a> defined a "perennial manylinux
spec" that is based on the glibc version number. A lot of work has <a href="https://github.com/pypa/manylinux/issues/542">already
taken place</a> to support the next
version. Now we need to take the dive: decide what the base OS for the next
manylinux tag will be, roll out a Docker image and tooling around it, and
convince library packaging teams to adopt it. This is needed to allow libraries
like NumPy to confidently use the glibc routines fixed after 2014. For
instance, <a href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/15763">this issue</a> is
preventing NumPy from properly supporting <code>np.float128</code> on Power and S390X.</p>
<h3>What about non-x86 machines and Linux?</h3>
<p>As mentioned before, starting with manylinux2014 <code>pip</code> and <code>wheel</code> supports
non-x86 architectures like ARM64. Many packages are just now starting to roll
out support for these architectures, as the CI systems that support open source
projects (like TravisCI) have only recently made those platforms available.
It might be easier for users to adopt Conda and the <code>conda-forge</code> channel
since conda-forge has support for non-x86 architectures today.</p>
<h3>OK, so what is the bottom line?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use pip v20 or later to make it easier on libarary packagers: modern pip
  versions will take the latest manylinux package they can support and will be
  forward-compatible with the PEP 600 perennial manylinux standard.</li>
<li>Manylinux1 and Python 3.6 are going away. Update your systems.</li>
<li>For people looking to move PEP 600 forward, the next step is to dive into the
  <a href="https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel">auditwheel</a> repo to define and support
  the next manylinux version. </li>
</ul>

<h3>raidz vs draid<a href="#raidz-vs-draid" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>ZFS users are most likely very familiar with raidz already, so a
comparison with draid would help. The illustrations below are
simplified, but sufficient for the purpose of a comparison. For example,
31 drives can be configured as a zpool of 6 raidz1 vdevs and a hot
spare: <img alt="raidz1" src="https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/_images/draid_raidz.png"></p>
<p>As shown above, if drive 0 fails and is replaced by the hot spare, only
5 out of the 30 surviving drives will work to resilver: drives 1-4 read,
and drive 30 writes.</p>
<p>The same 30 drives can be configured as 1 draid1 vdev of the same level
of redundancy (i.e. single parity, 1/4 parity ratio) and single spare
capacity: <img alt="draid1" src="https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/_images/draid_draid.png"></p>
<p>The drives are shuffled in a way that, after drive 0 fails, all 30
surviving drives will work together to restore the lost data/parity:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>All 30 drives read, because unlike the raidz1 configuration shown
above, in the draid1 configuration the neighbor drives of the failed
drive 0 (i.e. drives in a same data+parity group) are not fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>All 30 drives write, because now there is no dedicated spare drive.
Instead, spare blocks come from all drives.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Normal application IO: draid and raidz are very similar. There’s a
slight advantage in draid, since there’s no dedicated spare drive
which is idle when not in use.</p></li>
<li><p>Restore lost data/parity: for raidz, not all surviving drives will
work to rebuild, and in addition it’s bounded by the write throughput
of a single replacement drive. For draid, the rebuild speed will
scale with the total number of drives because all surviving drives
will work to rebuild.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The dRAID vdev must shuffle its child drives in a way that regardless of
which drive has failed, the rebuild IO (both read and write) will
distribute evenly among all surviving drives, so the rebuild speed will
scale. The exact mechanism used by the dRAID vdev driver is beyond the
scope of this simple introduction here. If interested, please refer to
the recommended readings in the next section.</p>

<h3>Recommended Reading<a href="#recommended-reading" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Parity declustering (the fancy term for shuffling drives) has been an
active research topic, and many papers have been published in this area.
The <a href="http://www.cse.scu.edu/~tschwarz/TechReports/hpca.pdf">Permutation Development Data
Layout</a> is a
good paper to begin. The dRAID vdev driver uses a shuffling algorithm
loosely based on the mechanism described in this paper.</p>

<h2>Using dRAID<a href="#using-draid" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>First get the code <a href="https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/pull/10102">here</a>,
build zfs with <em>configure –enable-debug</em>, and install. Then load the
zfs kernel module with the following options which help dRAID rebuild
performance.</p>

<h3>Create a dRAID vdev<a href="#create-a-draid-vdev" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Similar to raidz vdev a dRAID vdev can be created using the
<code><span>zpool</span> <span>create</span></code> command:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span># zpool create &lt;pool&gt; draid[1,2,3][ &lt;vdevs...&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Unlike raidz, additional options may be provided as part of the
<code><span>draid</span></code> vdev type to specify an exact dRAID layout. When unspecific
reasonable defaults will be chosen.</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span># zpool create &lt;pool&gt; draid[1,2,3][:&lt;groups&gt;g][:&lt;spares&gt;s][:&lt;data&gt;d][:&lt;iterations&gt;] &lt;vdevs...&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<ul>
<li><p>groups - Number of redundancy groups (default: 1 group per 12 vdevs)</p></li>
<li><p>spares - Number of distributed hot spares (default: 1)</p></li>
<li><p>data - Number of data devices per group (default: determined by
number of groups)</p></li>
<li><p>iterations - Number of iterations to perform generating a valid dRAID
mapping (default 3).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Notes</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The default values are not set in stone and may change.</p></li>
<li><p>For the majority of common configurations we intend to provide
pre-computed balanced dRAID mappings.</p></li>
<li><p>When <em>data</em> is specified then: (draid_children - spares) % (parity +
data) == 0, otherwise the pool creation will fail.</p></li>

<p>There are two logical hot spare vdevs shown above at the bottom:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The names begin with a <code><span>s&lt;id&gt;-</span></code> followed by the name of the parent
dRAID vdev.</p></li>
<li><p>These hot spares are logical, made from reserved blocks on all the 53
child drives of the dRAID vdev.</p></li>
<li><p>Unlike traditional hot spares, the distributed spare can only replace
a drive in its parent dRAID vdev.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The dRAID vdev behaves just like a raidz vdev of the same parity level.
You can do IO to/from it, scrub it, fail a child drive and it’d operate
in degraded mode.</p>

<h3>Rebuild to distributed spare<a href="#rebuild-to-distributed-spare" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When there’s a failed/offline child drive, the dRAID vdev supports a
completely new mechanism to reconstruct lost data/parity, in addition to
the resilver. First of all, resilver is still supported - if a failed
drive is replaced by another physical drive, the resilver process is
used to reconstruct lost data/parity to the new replacement drive, which
is the same as a resilver in a raidz vdev.</p>
<p>But if a child drive is replaced with a distributed spare, a new process
called rebuild is used instead of resilver:</p>

<p>The scan status line of the <em>zpool status</em> output now says <em>“rebuilt”</em>
instead of <em>“resilvered”</em>, because the lost data/parity was rebuilt to
the distributed spare by a brand new process called <em>“rebuild”</em>. The
main differences from <em>resilver</em> are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The rebuild process does not scan the whole block pointer tree.
Instead, it only scans the spacemap objects.</p></li>
<li><p>The IO from rebuild is sequential, because it rebuilds metaslabs one
by one in sequential order.</p></li>
<li><p>The rebuild process is not limited to block boundaries. For example,
if 10 64K blocks are allocated contiguously, then rebuild will fix
640K at one time. So rebuild process will generate larger IOs than
resilver.</p></li>
<li><p>For all the benefits above, there is one price to pay. The rebuild
process cannot verify block checksums, since it doesn’t have block
pointers.</p></li>
<li><p>Moreover, the rebuild process requires support from on-disk format,
and <strong>only</strong> works on draid and mirror vdevs. Resilver, on the other
hand, works with any vdev (including draid).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Although rebuild process creates larger IOs, the drives will not
necessarily see large IO requests. The block device queue parameter
<em>/sys/block/</em>/queue/max_sectors_kb* must be tuned accordingly. However,
since the rebuild IO is already sequential, the benefits of enabling
larger IO requests might be marginal.</p>
<p>At this point, redundancy has been fully restored without adding any new
drive to the pool. If another drive is offlined, the pool is still able
to do IO:</p>

				<p><h2>Small, portable laser pointers could be used to guide lightning strikes, with a study suggesting the technology may prevent bolts from sparking wildfires, a researcher told AFP Thursday.</h2></p>
			</div> <!-- .et_pb_text --><div>
				
				
				<div><p>A team of international scientists have shown storm clouds could be “short-circuited” by using a hollow laser — like a pipe of light — to deliver particles into the clouds and draw lightning strikes, research co-author Professor Andrey Miroshnichenko from the University of New South Wales in Canberra told AFP.</p>
<p>In lab tests, the team — which also included scientists from the Australian National University (ANU) — successfully used a laser tractor beam to direct the path of an electrical discharge to specific targets, Miroshnichenko said.</p>
<p>In the past, high-powered lasers were needed to achieve similar results, making the technique dangerous, costly and inaccurate.<span>&nbsp;</span></p></div>

				<div><p>But the new research suggested that small, hand-held lasers could be used in the field within the next decade, he said.</p>
<p>“It turns out that to deliver particles, you do not need high-intensity lasers, even low intensity like your laser pointer will be already enough,” Miroshnichenko said.</p>
<p>Using a tractor beam with a hollow centre, micro-particles in the air could be heated up and delivered to a specific point and trigger an electrical discharge.</p></div>

				<div><p>Although it is yet to be tested outside a lab, the technique could potentially be used to control dry lightning strikes, infamous for sparking large blazes including several major <a href="https://www.breakingasia.com/trending/social-media-fakes-australia-bushfire-disinformation/">bushfires in Australia</a> and the western US in the past year, Miroshnichenko added.</p>
<p>“We can imagine a future where this technology may induce electrical discharge from passing lightning, helping to guide it to safe targets and reduce the risk of <a href="https://www.breakingasia.com/trending/makeshift-hospital-saving-dozens-of-koalas-injured-in-bushfires/">catastrophic fires</a>,” co-researcher Vladlen Shvedov, from the ANU Research School of Physics, said.</p>
<p>The research, published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19183-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nature Communications last month</a>, also involved Texas A&amp;M University in Qatar and the University of California in Los Angeles.<span>&nbsp;</span></p></div>

  <p><time>10 Nov 2020</time>
  </p>
  <p>Haskell’s type classes and deriving facilities are a killer feature for type safety and extensibility.
Over nearly 30 years they’ve acquired quite a bit of cruft and language extensions.
With <code>DerivingVia</code>, we now have the ability to dramatically simplify the deriving story.</p>

<p>This post outlines a change to the <em>language</em> that would hopefully be adopted with the next version of the language standard.
They get less reasonable and more dramatic as the post goes on.</p>



<p>GHC has a ton of extensions that only serve to unlock additional type classes to the “stock” deriving strategy.
<code>Derive{Functor,Foldable,Traversable,Generic,Lift,etc}</code>.
We can remove all of these extensions by folding them into the <code>stock</code> deriving strategy.</p>



<p><code>DeriveAnyClass</code> is a footgun.
It allows you to write any type class in a <code>deriving</code> clause.
It pastes in an “empty” instance, relying on <code>DefaultSignatures</code> to fill in the values.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>-- With DeriveAnyClass:</span>
<span>data</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>X</span>
  <span>deriving</span> <span>ToJSON</span>

<span>-- Without:</span>
<span>data</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>X</span>

<span>instance</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>X</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p><code>DefaultSignatures</code> is used to give a single default implementation of a type class if the underlying type matches a more restrictive constraint.
This is primarily used to provide <code>Generic</code>-based implementations with very little syntax.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>X</span> <span>deriving</span> <span>Generic</span>

<span>-- with DefaultSignatures:</span>

<span>class</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>a</span> <span>where</span>
    <span>toJSON</span> <span>::</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Value</span>
    <span>default</span> <span>toJSON</span> <span>::</span> <span>(</span><span>Generic</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>GToJSON</span> <span>(</span><span>Rep</span> <span>a</span><span>))</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Value</span>
    <span>toJSON</span> <span>=</span> <span>gtoJSON</span> 

<span>instance</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>X</span>

<span>-- without DefaultSignatures:</span>

<span>class</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>a</span> <span>where</span>
    <span>toJSON</span> <span>::</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Value</span>

<span>instance</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>X</span> <span>where</span>
    <span>toJSON</span> <span>=</span> <span>gtoJSON</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>By privileging a single default, it makes any other possible defaults less useful and less discoverable.</p>

<p>The <code>DeriveAnyClass</code> utility is subsumed by <code>DerivingVia</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>newtype</span> <span>Generically</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>Generically</span> <span>a</span>

<span>instance</span> <span>(</span><span>Generic</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>GToJSON</span> <span>(</span><span>Rep</span> <span>a</span><span>))</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>(</span><span>Generically</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>where</span>
    <span>toJSON</span> <span>(</span><span>Generically</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>gtoJSON</span> <span>a</span>

<span>data</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>X</span> 
    <span>deriving</span> <span>stock</span> <span>Generic</span>
    <span>deriving</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>via</span> <span>Generically</span> <span>X</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>This extension is subsumed by <code>DerivingVia</code>, also.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>-- with GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving</span>
<span>newtype</span> <span>UserId</span> <span>=</span> <span>UserId</span> <span>Text</span>
    <span>deriving</span> <span>newtype</span> <span>(</span><span>Show</span><span>,</span> <span>ToJSON</span><span>)</span>

<span>-- with DerivingVia</span>
<span>newtype</span> <span>UserId</span> <span>=</span> <span>UserId</span> <span>Text</span>
    <span>deriving</span> <span>(</span><span>Show</span><span>,</span> <span>ToJSON</span><span>)</span> <span>via</span> <span>Text</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>Now that there’s only two strategies, we can get rid of <code>DerivingStrategies</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>-- Before</span>
<span>data</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>X</span>
    <span>deriving</span> <span>stock</span> <span>(</span><span>Show</span><span>,</span> <span>Generic</span><span>)</span>
    <span>deriving</span> <span>(</span><span>ToJSON</span><span>,</span> <span>FromJSON</span><span>)</span> <span>via</span> <span>Generically</span> <span>X</span>

<p>Currently, you must write the complete type in a <code>DerivingVia</code> clause.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>X</span> 
    <span>deriving</span> <span>Generic</span>

    <span>deriving</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>via</span> <span>Text</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This can be cumbersome for a very large type.</p>

<pre><code>newtype App a = App (ExceptT () (StateT () (ReaderT () IO)) a)
    deriving
        ( Functor
        , Applicative
        , Monad
        , MonadReader ()
        , MonadError ()
        , MonadState ()
        )
      via
        ExceptT () (StateT () (ReaderT () IO))
</code></pre>

<p>It’s also annoyingly repetitive, and can lead to errors.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>=</span> <span>Foo</span> 
    <span>deriving</span> <span>Generic</span>

<p>A wildcard can be used to indicate either:</p>

<p>a. The underlying type of a <code>newtype</code>, or 
b. The type of the <code>data</code> declaration.</p>

<p>There are two ways to derive things: <code>StandaloneDeriving</code> and attached deriving.
Attached deriving is redundant, but convenient.
<code>StandaloneDeriving</code> is more powerful, but less convenient.
Attached deriving clauses don’t work with <code>GADTs</code>.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>



<p>The problem with the above proposal is that it carries a significant syntax cost.
The keyword <code>deriving</code> is repeated for each instance, the keyword <code>instance</code> is repeated, the <code>via _</code> clause is repeated, and the type name is repeated.
Multiple instances should be derivable with the same context.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>=</span> <span>Foo</span>

<span>deriving</span> <span>Foo</span> 
    <span>(</span> <span>Generic</span>
    <span>,</span> <span>via</span> 
        <span>(</span><span>Generically</span> <span>_</span><span>)</span>
        <span>(</span> <span>ToJSON</span>
        <span>,</span> <span>FromJSON</span>
        <span>)</span>
    <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this block, we define the <code>ToJSON</code> and <code>FromJSON</code> instances using the same <code>Generically</code> viatype.
We can still use <code>_</code> to refer to the type, since we know the type we’re deriving for: <code>Foo</code>.
This recovers the syntax convenience of “attached deriving.”</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>newtype</span> <span>App</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>App</span> <span>...</span>

<span>deriving</span> <span>App</span>
    <span>via</span> <span>_</span>
        <span>instance</span> 
            <span>(</span> <span>Functor</span>
            <span>,</span> <span>Applicative</span>
            <span>,</span> <span>Monad</span>
            <span>,</span> <span>MonadReader</span> <span>()</span>
            <span>,</span> <span>MonadError</span> <span>()</span>
            <span>,</span> <span>MonadState</span> <span>()</span>
            <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This also recovers the convenience of attached deriving.
Let’s look at the main <em>point</em> - GADTs.
Otherwise we could just remove <code>StandaloneDeriving</code> (with the nice benefit/tragedy of banning orphan derived instance).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Some</span> <span>f</span> <span>where</span>
    <span>Some</span> <span>::</span> <span>Show</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>f</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Some</span> <span>f</span>

<span>-- old</span>
<span>deriving</span>

<span>-- new</span>
<span>deriving</span> <span>Some</span>
    <span>(</span><span>forall</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span> <span>Show</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Show</span> <span>(</span><span>f</span> <span>a</span><span>))</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Show</span> <span>(</span><span>_</span> <span>f</span><span>)</span>

<span>-- generally,</span>
<span>deriving</span> <span>SomeGadtType</span>
    <span>(</span><span>SomeContextOn</span> <span>a</span> <span>b</span> <span>c</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        <span>(</span> <span>Show</span><span>,</span> <span>Eq</span><span>,</span> <span>ToJSON</span><span>,</span> <span>FromJSON</span>
        <span>)</span>
        <span>(</span><span>_</span> <span>a</span> <span>b</span> <span>c</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>_</code> refers to the type name, without any variables applied.
So you need to apply the type variables in the instance head.
That’s a bit annoying, but maybe it’s fine</p>



<p>GHC provides a <code>newtype Stock a = Stock a</code> that hooks in to <code>DerivingVia</code> somehow.
Now we’re down to one deriving strategy.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>X</span>

<span>deriving</span> <span>X</span>
    <span>via</span> <span>Stock</span> <span>_</span>
        <span>(</span> <span>Eq</span><span>,</span> <span>Show</span><span>,</span> <span>Generic</span> <span>)</span>
    <span>via</span> <span>Generically</span> <span>_</span>
        <span>(</span> <span>ToJSON</span><span>,</span> <span>FromJSON</span> <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This “deprivileges” the <code>Stock</code> deriving classes.</p>



<p>OK, so maybe you don’t like getting rid of attached deriving.
Let’s get rid of standalone deriving instead.
We need <code>StandaloneDeriving</code> for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Orphan derived instances (shame on you)</li>
  <li>Specifying a context for GADTs and allow application of type variables</li>
</ol>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Some</span> <span>f</span> <span>where</span>
    <span>Some</span> <span>::</span> <span>Show</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>f</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Some</span> <span>f</span>
    <span>deriving</span>
        <span>(</span> <span>(</span><span>forall</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span> <span>Show</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Show</span> <span>(</span><span>f</span> <span>a</span><span>))</span>
            <span>=&gt;</span>
            <span>Show</span>
        <span>,</span> <span>-- generally,</span>
            <span>(</span><span>SomeContext</span> <span>f</span><span>)</span>
            <span>=&gt;</span>
            <span>SomeClass</span>
        <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The type variable <code>f</code> is in scope from the <code>data</code> declaration.</p>

<p>EDIT: <a href="https://twitter.com/quickdudley/status/1328068260659482624">@quickdudley</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nnotm/status/1327998875563683845">@nnotm</a> have correctly pointed out that you also want to be able to define instances of a class at the definition module of a class.
These are perfectly valid instances, and so we must keep <code>StandaloneDeriving</code>.</p>



<p>Alright, post is done.
These ideas are certainly controversial and Bad, but <em>man</em> wouldn’t it be nice to have a simpler story around deriving and type class instances?
The current story is so complex, and I think we can genuinely simplify Haskell-the-language by trimming some fat here.</p>

<p>EDIT: <a href="https://twitter.com/am_i_tom/status/1327992136151789568">@i_am_tom</a> posted a reference to the <a href="https://github.com/tysonzero/ghc-proposals/blob/concrete-class-dictionaries/proposals/0000-concrete-class-dictionaries.md">Concrete Class Dictionaries</a> GHC proposal, which subsumes a lot of this.</p>

    <p>It's November 2020. There is no cure for coronavirus. What can we do to prevent the disaster?</p>
    <p>Let's take a look at several simulations of the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>I recommend to visit website from desktop for better experience. Phone may has performance issues.</p>
    <h3>Simulation rules</h3>
    <h4>Assumptions</h4>
    <p>Desease lasts a long time: <strong>2 to 5 weeks.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>30%</strong> of people develop severe symptoms. They are especially vulnerable in a case of a lack of medical care due to overwhelmed medical facilities or weak healthcare systems.</p>
    <p><strong>3%</strong> of people are destined to die. <a href="https://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-gb/3000168/pdf/3000168/COVID-19.pdf" target="_blank"> [Source]</a>. It is due to genetic and age reasons. We are assuming we can save the people through vaccination or isolation. Unfortunately as of November 2020 there are no vaccines approved for public use.</p>
    <h4>Possible states of a person</h4>
    <p><span id="guide-healty"></span> - a healthy person.</p>
    <p><span id="guide-ill"></span> - a sick person. They infect other individuals in a small area around them.</p>
    <p><span id="guide-serious"></span> - a seriously sick person with severe symptoms. They die if the medical system is overloaded. We assume the healthcare system  can handle a maximum of 200 patients at a time. Also, severely ill patients move much slower than other people.</p>
    <p><span id="guide-dead"></span> - a dead person.</p>
    <p><span id="guide-immunity"></span> - a recovered perso. We assume they have developed an immunity and can not get reinfected.</p>
    <h4>Modificators</h4>
    <div>
        <p><span id="guide-healty-mask"></span> - a person with mask. <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/10/22/national/science-health/japan-masks-block-coronavirus/" target="_blank">Mask retains up to 50% of exhaled viruses</a>. Also it retains up to 40% of inhaled viruses. If both persons
            wear masks a synergy effect appears.</p>
        <p><span id="guide-healty-screen"></span> - a person with screen. Screen additionally protects against infection.</p>
        <p><span id="guide-healty-both"></span> - a person with screen and mask.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Let's get started</h2>
    <h3>Virus in a small virtual city</h3>
    <p>There is a virtual city with population of 2 000 people. People contact each other as usual. No measures are taken. What could go wrong? Check it.</p>

          <div id="game-simulation-small-city">
    <p><a id="start-pause-button-small-city" onclick="startButton('small-city', this)">Start</a>
        <span id="no-ill-small-city">No sick people left. Pandemy is over.</span>
        <a id="reset-button-small-city" onclick="resetButton('small-city')">Reset</a>
    </p>
    <p>Hint: game field is scrollable</p>
    
</div>    
    <p>At the end of simulation you will see that everyone get desease. Results may vary, but I had a disaster my first simulation. I have got up to 1500 sick people at same time and
        600 dead people at the end. These are 75% and 30%, respectively. Each person with severe symptoms died.</p>

    <h3>Isolation of sick people</h3>
    <p>We have not taken any measures to protect people. Obviously, we can isolate patients in hospitals. Let's be honest, complete isolation is not possible. Patients will still
        be in contact with service personnel, such as doctors, janitors, couriers. So the virus can be passed on, but it happens less likely.</p>
    <p>Let's see how this affects the spread of the virus. <strong>It is a perfect scenario!</strong> Be prepared it takes long time. I recommend to move ahead after 90th day,
        there is nothing interesting in the following days.</p>

          <div id="game-simulation-isolate-small">
    <p><a id="start-pause-button-isolate-small" onclick="startButton('isolate-small', this)">Start</a>
        <span id="no-ill-isolate-small">No sick people left. Pandemy is over.</span>
        <a id="reset-button-isolate-small" onclick="resetButton('isolate-small')">Reset</a>
    </p>
    <p>Hint: game field is scrollable</p>
    
</div>    
    <p>Wow! In my simulation there were so few infections that medical care was enough for everyone. Over time, the number of people with immunity increased. At some point, the
        patients were in contact only with people with immunity and could not spread the virus further.</p>
    <p>My result is 70 people who died over 498 days of pandemy. Exactly 3% that are in the genetics of people. So, what is your result?</p>

    <h3>Isolation of sick people in real life</h3>
    <p>Sadly, not all people observe isolation. And alas, not all sick people know that they are ill. There is no scientific work reporting how many people are asymptomatic. In my
        city one clinic said 25% of its positive tests were from people with no signs of illness. Let's take this number as a basis. <strong>25% of those infected will not show
            symptoms and will move freely around the city.</strong></p>
          <div id="game-simulation-isolate-part-small">
    <p><a id="start-pause-button-isolate-part-small" onclick="startButton('isolate-part-small', this)">Start</a>
        <span id="no-ill-isolate-part-small">No sick people left. Pandemy is over.</span>
        <a id="reset-button-isolate-part-small" onclick="resetButton('isolate-part-small')">Reset</a>
    </p>
    <p>Hint: game field is scrollable</p>
    
</div>        <p>Well, the burden on the healthcare system is still less than in the very first scenario. But a cemeteries are overcrowded again.</p>

    <h3>Isolation of sick people in real life. But with masks and screens</h3>
    <p>May be masks and screens will help? Of course not all people wear them. Let's say <strong>10% of people wear screens and 50% of people wear masks</strong>.</p>
          <div id="game-simulation-isolate-part-small-masks">
    <p><a id="start-pause-button-isolate-part-small-masks" onclick="startButton('isolate-part-small-masks', this)">Start</a>
        <span id="no-ill-isolate-part-small-masks">No sick people left. Pandemy is over.</span>
        <a id="reset-button-isolate-part-small-masks" onclick="resetButton('isolate-part-small-masks')">Reset</a>
    </p>
    <p>Hint: game field is scrollable</p>
    
</div>        <p>Hmm. Although the effect is small, it is there. Why masks have not worked? Actually they worked. But if you have chance of infection as 5%, 20 contacts turns it to 74%,
        that's it! How many contacts do you have in pub or in club? Do you consider you are breathing the same air with all the pub visitors?</p>
    <h3>Isolation + masks + screens + self-isolation</h3>
    <p>So, our goal is to reduce the number of contacts. It's time for self-isonation. Don't forget to build houses for everyone in our virtual city in advance.</p>
    <p>In this case we have a chance to isolate people who do not know they are ill. One more modification in this simulation is prevention of infection through the walls.</p>
    <p>I live in Russia. So I will draw on the experience of my country. The Moscow mayor's office has obliged business to send <strong>30% of employee to work from home</strong>.
        Let's check what happens when this order is respected.</p>
          <div id="game-simulation-selfisolate-part-small-masks">
    <p><a id="start-pause-button-selfisolate-part-small-masks" onclick="startButton('selfisolate-part-small-masks', this)">Start</a>
        <span id="no-ill-selfisolate-part-small-masks">No sick people left. Pandemy is over.</span>
        <a id="reset-button-selfisolate-part-small-masks" onclick="resetButton('selfisolate-part-small-masks')">Reset</a>
    </p>
    <p>Hint: game field is scrollable</p>
    
</div>        <p>This set of measures has shown maximum efficiency. About 70% of people did not even get infected by the end of the simulation.</p>
    <p>This is most effective step in fight with epidemy. </p>

<p><strong>It’s time for the holidays and what better way to share love and memories with your family than to create an old-school, vintage movie? You don’t need a time-machine to go back to the 50s or 60s to rmake your homevideo look like a vintage movie. All you need is FFmpeg, some imagination, and perhaps the rest of this guide 🙂 </strong></p>



<p>Let’s take a look at how you can use FFmpeg to make your videos look like old-school/vintage/retro-styled movies, shall we?</p>



<hr>



<h2>What’s Do I Mean By A Vintage Movie?</h2>



<p>Well, good question! </p>



<p><strong>My definition of an old-school movie is a movie with a low frame-rate (like 15 fps), lots of scratches and film-grain to give an aged look, and a sepia tint to it!</strong></p>



<p>Let’s see how we can achieve all of this using FFmpeg.</p>



<p>For this tutorial, I shall be using the “Touchdown Pass” sequence from <a href="https://media.xiph.org/video/derf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xiph</a> to illustrate the steps. It’s a 20 second video, but for the sake of this tutorial, I’ll be cutting it to 10 seconds using FFmpeg (<a href="https://ottverse.com/trim-cut-video-using-start-endtime-reencoding-ffmpeg/">here’s how to do that</a>).</p>



<p>Let’s get started! </p>



<hr>



<h2>Step 1: Changing the Frame Rate using FFmpeg</h2>



<p>The first step is to “speed” up the video. Let’s take the video back to pre-30fps or pre-60fps days and take it all the way down to 10 fps. This gives the video an old-school look right off the bat! </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i td-10sec.mp4 \
-filter:v fps=fps=10 \
td-fast.mp4</code></pre>



<p>Here is the sped-up video. </p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/479524704" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>



<hr>



<h2>Step 2: Give The Video a Vintage Look using FFmpeg’s filters</h2>



<p>Next, let’s change the rich, wonderful colors and bring a sepia-link tint to the entire video. This can be done using FFmpeg’s in-built <code>curves</code> filter. You can use the <code>curves</code> filter to change the amount of R, G, B in a frame and specify the “curves” that govern the change or shift in colors. </p>



<p>Luckily for us, FFmpeg has a pre-defined <code>vintage</code> filter that works pretty well, I must say! Here is the commandline to convert our sped-up video into a “vintage” looking video. Simple, right?</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i td-fast.mp4 \
-vf curves=vintage \
td-vintage-fast.mp4</code></pre>



<p>Here’s the result of the <code>curves=vintage</code> filter on our footall video.</p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/479525304" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>



<hr>



<h2>Step 3: Getting a Film Grain Overlay and Resizing It</h2>



<p>As the final step, let’s add a lot of film-grain and “scratches” to make our video look like something that was shot on film, stored in a dusty old cupboard, and discovered 40 years later! </p>



<p>I found a fantastic “old school” film overlay on YouTube (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_MZb7qTenE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source link</a>) with a download link. </p>



<figure><div>
<p><span><iframe width="1200" height="675" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J_MZb7qTenE?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></span></p>
</div></figure>



<p>The video’s size is <code>1440x1080</code> pixels and so I had to resize it to <code>1920x1080</code> to match the size of my input video. </p>



<p>Here is the command to resize a video using FFmpeg using the the <code>scale</code> filter. I’ve stored the output video as <code>oldFilm1080.mp4</code>.</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i old-film-grain.wmv \
-vf scale=1920:1080,setsar=1:1 \
oldFilm1080.mp4</code></pre>



<hr>



<h2>Step 4: Add the Overlay To Your Video</h2>



<p>Now we have two videos with us – </p>



<ol><li>our old-school film-grain-scratchy video</li><li>our vintage-looking, sped-up football video. </li></ol>



<p>Now all that’s left to do is to overlay them on each other and enjoy the fruits of <s>our</s> FFmpeg’s labor! </p>



<p>Here’s the commandline to achieve that. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe \
-i oldFilm1080.mp4 \
-i td-vintage-fast.mp4 \
-filter_complex "[0]format=rgba,colorchannelmixer=aa=0.25[fg];\
[1][fg]overlay[out]" \
-map [out] \
-pix_fmt yuv420p -c:v libx264 -crf 18 \
touchdown-vintage.mp4</code></pre>



<p>So, what’s going on here? </p>



<ul><li>we provide two input videos to FFmpeg </li><li>using <code>filter_complex</code>, we use <code>colorchannelmixer</code> to overlay by modifying the alpha channel of the film-grain video that is referred to as <code>[0]</code> and and let’s call the output <code>[fg]</code>. It’s black and white, so modifying only the alpha is good enough for our use case. The syntax is as follows <code>colorchannelmixer=rr:rg:rb:ra:gr:gg:gb:ga:br:bg:bb:ba:ar:ag:ab:aa</code>. </li><li>we are modifying only the alpha, and so, we modify only the <code>aa</code> (output’s alpha) to <code>0.25</code>.</li><li>then, we use the vintage-looking football video (referred to as <code>[1]</code>) and overlay them both using the <code>overlay</code> filter to create an interim output stored in a variable called <code>[out]</code>. This is shown in the commands –&gt; <code>[1][fg]overlay[out]</code></li><li>then, we encode the interim output to give us the final video using H.264 with <code>crf=18</code> which should give us a good quality video.</li></ul>







<p><strong>Here is what the final output looks like! Cool, isn’t it? </strong></p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/479529512" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>







<p>And, here’s how it looks side-by-side the original video. </p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/479529447" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>







<p>Now you can change the opacity of the alpha channels, use a different film grain video, or use a different <code>curves</code> function, but, the process won’t change much. </p>



<p>Hope you all have a lot of fun making “<strong>vintage</strong>” videos this holiday season and please let me know in the comments how it went! Please create some fun videos, share them with your loved ones, and have a few laughs 🙂 </p>

                </div>
                <p>Properties are a really nice feature of modern languages, and I've recently
                    gotten attached to them in Kotlin. For a while
                    I wasn't comfortable with the idea of 'fields' performing arbitrary computation,
                    but having used them for a few months now I'm really enjoying the simplicity -
                    <em>especially</em> when moving back to Java!</p>
                <p>Having given it some thought, I wanted to lay out a case in support of
                    properties which highlights their benefits over directly accessing fields (which
                    is mostly about getters/setters, but nonetheless), and how we can establish some
                    guidelines on when properties should not be used to avoid the issue of
                    arbitrary computation causing side effects or other unexpected behavior.</p>
                
                <p>In short, a property is <abbr title="Features which aid readability or ease of use but do not impact semantics.">syntax sugar</abbr> for getter/setter methods that look
                    like fields. Instead of having to use the methods <code>item.getQuantity()</code> and
                    <code>item.setQuantity()</code>, we can access the property <code>item.quantity</code> and set it
                    using <code>item.quantity = 1</code>, exactly like a field. The compiler transforms property
                    access and assignment to use the appropriate getters/setters (hence, syntax sugar).
                </p>
                <p>The most noteworthy consequence of this is, in my opinion, allowing <em>validation
                    on assigment</em>. For example, <code>item.quantity</code> may be defined as follows (in Kotlin):</p>
<pre><span>class</span> <span>Item</span> {
    <span>var</span> <span>quantity</span>: <span>Int</span> = <span>0</span>
        <span>set</span>(value) {
            require(value &gt;= <span>0</span>) <span>//throws if negative</span>
            <span>field</span> = value
        }
}
</pre>
<pre><span>
  <i onclick="openDemo('item-property', this)"></i>
</span>item.<span>quantity</span> = <span>-10</span>;
</pre>
                
                <p>The largest benefit of properties is replacing field use, which has a massive
                    amount of drawbacks, with methods instead. In languages like C++ and Java that
                    don't have properties, the best practice is to keep all fields private and
                    manually create getters and setters. More modern languages, like C# and Kotlin,
                    use properties for this instead which can do that automatically.</p>
                <p>Most of the following points are also benefits of using getters/setters over
                    fields, and then properties step in to provide the extra bit of syntax sugar icing on
                    the cake.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Property getters/setters can have different <abbr title="public/private and friends">access modifiers</abbr>, allowing for
                        fields which are read-only for external use but still mutable within the class.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Example: In Kotlin, <code>val&nbsp;counter&nbsp;=&nbsp;0&nbsp;private&nbsp;set</code>
                                defines a <code>counter</code> field that can be publicly accessed but not modified (unless within the class).
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Getters/setters can be used to maintain <abbr title="A (mathematical) property which is expected to hold true in all cases

For example, a unit vector (3D) has the invariant x² + y² + z² == 1.">invariants</abbr> and perform other
                        validation work, such as <code>quantity&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;0</code> in the opening example.
                    </li>
                    <li>Since getters/setters are methods, the implementation can be changed without
                        breaking either <abbr title="Application Programming Interface

The interface of the *source* code">API</abbr> or <abbr title="Application Binary Interface

The interface of the *compiled* code">ABI</abbr> compatibility.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Example: A <code>Vector</code> class could have <code>x/y/z</code> properties, but
                                change the implementation to use a component array <code>[x, y, z]</code> instead without issue.
                            </li>
                            <li>Additionally, getters/setters can be inlined during optimization to speed up performance at the cost of ABI compatibility.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Properties can be used in interfaces since they're backed by methods, while fields require getters/setters to be defined for them. Notably, these getters/setters would still need to have fields defined in the implementing class to handle their values, while a property can handle that automatically.
                    </li>
                    <li>Properties can be used for methods which often behave like fields, but
                        cannot be implemented with one due to subtypes requiring computation or
                        other restrictions.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Example: <code>List#size()</code> generally doesn't need computation and returns the
                                value of a field, but some implementations (such as a <abbr title="A form of linked list which doesn't track its size, comes from Lisp

Honestly google it, this text box can't do it justice">cons list</abbr>) might.
                            </li>
                            <li>Whether <code>List#size()</code> should be a property is certainly debatable, but with how frequently collections are used I think it's almost a necessity.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Properties are a <em>single unit</em>. Getters/setters are located in the same
                        location in the source code as the property declaration, making it easier to
                        fully understand a field as opposed to having them defined in separate locations.
                    </li>
                    <li>Properties almost always have syntax sugar for providing default
                        implementations of <code>get/set</code> (if it's not already done automatically). In Kotlin, <code>val property</code> provides a default
                        getter while <code>var property</code> provides both a getter and setter.
                    </li>
                    <li>Debugging properties is possible without a dedicated debugger by using
                        getters/setters. This may be minor for large languages, but if your language
                        doesn't have an IDE or still in development this is <em>extremely</em> useful.
                    </li>
                    <li>Readability is often increased, albeit debatable. I personally find <code>item.quantity&nbsp;=&nbsp;1</code> to
                        be more readable than <code>item.setQuantity(1)</code>, especially in large chains.
                    </li>
                    <li>Generally, properties imply 'simple' behavior, like fields, as opposed to complex
                        computation that some methods may perform. We'll talk about this in detail soon.
                    </li>

                            <span>So what are the downsides?</span>
                        </h2>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>I think there are two notable downsides to having properties. First, the
                    performance difference between field access and method calls can be significant,
                    especially in low level languages. Second, field access has clear, well-defined
                    behavior while a method call could effectively do anything, thus making it
                    harder to reason about code. Let's dig in to both of these.</p>
                
                <p>Field access is almost always language primitive, and is therefore faster than
                    doing the work of a method call (which then has to access <em>something</em> anyways).</p>
                <p>That said, compiler optimizations like <abbr title="Replacing a method call with it's implementation">inlining</abbr> can easily resolve this for
                    simple properties. In more complex cases, this is actually where properties are
                    most useful - a field itself wasn't sufficient, so the alternative would have
                    been a method call or sacrificing validation anyways.</p>
                <p>In low level languages where memory layout is often important, knowing a field
                    access corresponds to a memory lookup (and not arbitrary computation) can be
                    important. In higher level languages, particularly Object Oriented ones that
                    often encapsulate fields behind methods anyways, I don't believe this
                    distinction is as necessary.</p>
                <div>
                    <div>
                        <h3 id="problem-2-arbitrary-computation">
                            <span>
                                <a href="#problem-2-arbitrary-computation">
                                    <i></i>
                                </a>
                            </span>
                            <span>Problem 2: Arbitrary Computation</span>
                        </h3>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Finally, we've made our way to what I believe is the core issue: since
                    properties can perform arbitrary computation, it is unclear what potential
                    behavior getting/setting a property may have. The extreme example here, of
                    course, is deleting the entire file system. Fields on the other hand have
                    clearly defined behavior - get or set the value, nothing more.</p>
                <p>However, these type of assumptions are not unique to properties. We apply the
                    same assumptions to methods (and honestly everything) as well. I often presume
                    that <code>getX()</code> and <code>setX(x)</code> have 'simple' behavior, but they could use lazy
                    initialization, have unexpected validation checks, or cause side-effects and
                    other unexpected behavior
                    like a database <code>getConnection()</code>. Naming is one of the two hard problems in computer science,
                    likely because we carry assumptions with us that may not always fit.</p>
                <p>That said, these assumptions …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="contentdiv">

<p>I spent a few hours spread over the last couple of weeks to learn every single one of VSCode’s keyboard shortcuts, specifically the 149 shortcuts from the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf">official keyboard shortcuts reference</a>. These are also present in <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collections/vscode/">KeyCombiner’s searchable table of VSCode shortcuts</a>.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I started this challenge to write a blog post about it afterward and as a way to promote <a href="https://keycombiner.com/">KeyCombiner</a> via content marketing. The blog post I had in mind would be similar to my previous one, <a href="https://tkainrad.dev/posts/how-i-learned-50-new-keyboard-shortcuts-in-42-minutes/">documenting my process of learning 50 new web application shortcuts in 42 minutes</a>.</p>
<p>But, as it usually happens only in romantic comedies, my intentions changed over time. This article turned out much different. It is not about the learning process but about how this challenge changed some of the developing habits I had for many years. Workflows that I grew used to during many projects, different IDEs, and even varying programming languages suddenly evolved.</p>

<p>As software engineers, we like to think that we are continually learning and improving our skills. This is certainly true when it comes to the technologies we are using. However, our development habits, such as which features of our IDEs we use, are much more rigid. I believe most of our core workflows are formed early on and very hard to change.
I don’t have data to back this up, but when I look at myself, my co-workers, and other developers I know, this certainly seems true. If you think about it, it is not surprising, the same thing happens in other areas of life. For this very reason, you will find that developers who have studied or worked together will often use similar shortcuts, similar IDE features, and have similar limitations in their workflows.</p>
<p>The usual way to combat this is reading books, blog posts, attending conferences, well, everything that is used in our industry to extend our knowledge. However, with fundamental developing habits, I have found that this works poorly. You might read about a neat feature of your IDE, or see someone demo their workflow, but when you are eventually sitting in front of your screen and writing code, it is easy to fall back to what we already know, what is already set up, and proven to work.</p>
<p>After this experiment, I am convinced that keyboard shortcuts are the main factor in how we form our developing habits, and they can also stop us from evolving our habits.
Even before this challenge, I felt that I was good with shortcuts. I knew quite a few refactoring shortcuts, knew how to pause and stop program executing during debugging, was decent at jumping around between files, searching through my project, and all the other usual stuff. When I saw a co-worker using a shortcut that I didn’t know, I was quick to incorporate it into my workflow, too. After all, I was enough into shortcuts that I built a whole side-project around learning them.
<strong>The thing is, all new shortcuts that I learned were the ones that would augment my existing habits.</strong></p>
<p>This is a hen and egg problem; if you don’t know the shortcuts, you will not start to change your habits and use new IDE features because without shortcuts, they are too tedious to use or not at all usable. But if you don’t form new habits, you will not learn the shortcuts.</p>
<p><strong>Without intending it, I think I found a way to break out of this cycle:
Learning all IDE shortcuts very well <em>before</em> getting back to work. By learning <em>all</em> shortcuts, you are not limited to what somebody shows you and might not be compatible with your situation. You can naturally include what makes sense, in addition to your existing skills.</strong></p>
<p>The next section shows how this worked for me.</p>

<p>I started the learning process as it is usually done with KeyCombiner: By importing some shortcuts from the <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collections/vscode/">public collection of VSCode shortcuts</a> into a personal collection. Intuitively, I started with the ones I already knew and some additional that seemed most useful to me. Back then I was still trying to show that I could learn all shortcuts very quickly with KeyCombiner. I didn’t expect that shortcuts that had nothing to do with my existing workflows will be the real deal.</p>
<p>Some of the first combinations that I picked and that I did not know previously were <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>w</kbd>/<kbd>r</kbd>/<kbd>c</kbd> for toggling find options (match whole word, regex, case sensitivity) because I was already using those features. This went on for a few days. I did a couple practice runs every day and added new shortcuts whenever KeyCombiner was saying that I mastered all of the previous ones.</p>
<p>Eventually, I knew all shortcuts that seemed useful for how I was using VSCode back then. So I had to start adding shortcuts that had nothing to do with my existing habits. This brought up an interesting misconception. Often keyboard shortcuts are seen as a way to do things faster, compared to using the mouse. While that is true, I think there is an even more aspect to shortcut usage in IDEs: Many features are not used at all, if you don’t know the shortcut!</p>
<p>As I was learning new VSCode shortcuts every day, I started to use features that I previously didn’t even know of. One of the first things that suddenly made a lot of sense was <em>Select all Occurences of Find Match</em> with <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> as default binding, especially when combined with regex search. I was so excited about it, that I even <a href="https://twitter.com/ThomasKainrad/status/1305608337799761920">tweeted a Gif</a> showing how I use it to modify the CSV files that are the source for KeyCombiner’s public collection tables.</p>
<p>The process worked both ways: Sometimes, while I was practicing a shortcut on KeyCombiner, it seemed apparent that this was useful and that I should include it into my workflow. Sometimes it hit me while coding that I had just learned a shortcut that can make the current task more efficient.</p>
<p>In the following, I describe the most significant changes in my daily development habits. The list is far from complete though; there are many more small things that I picked up and frequently use now.</p>
<p><strong>Editor and Panel Management</strong><br>
Since knowing all the shortcuts to switch focus between panels and move editors around, I am using VSCode’s powerful layouting capabilities much more. I have 3-5 editor panels open at pretty much all times, seeing many related pieces of code at once. Working this way by using the mouse is very impractical.
I switch between editor panels with keyboard shortcuts and move editors from one group to the other.</p>
<p>There is one negative side-effect, though: I am starting to get annoyed when I use other IDEs (PyCharm, Eclipse), because they lack far behind VSCode when it comes to using multiple editors.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-cursor Editing</strong><br>
If you don’t know the shortcut to add additional cursors, I doubt you will ever use this incredibly powerful feature of VSCode. It is a typical feature that only blends into your habits once you know the shortcuts.
The basic commands are <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Down</kbd>/<kbd>Up</kbd> for adding cursors above/below. However, I found the commands to <em>Insert cursor at end of each line selected</em> (<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd>), and the above-mentioned <em>Select all Occurences of Find Match</em> (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>) even more powerful. These commands are why I frequently paste text snippets into VSCode, apply a few operations, and then copy-paste it back into whatever application I was using.</p>
<p><strong>Opening views by shortcut</strong><br>
I sometimes tried to do this before, but it never stuck. Now I finally switch to all views (Explorer, Debug, Search, Problems, etc.) with dedicated keyboard shortcuts. These shortcuts translate very nicely to other IDEs. After learning the VSCode default bindings, which are <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>&lt;char&gt;</kbd>, I set the same bindings also for Eclipse and PyCharm. Especially <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>e</kbd> for switching to the explorer view and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>d</kbd> for switching to the debug view are among my most used shortcuts now.</p>
<p><strong>Making Selections</strong><br>
I hate to admit it, but I did not use shortcuts to expand and shrink AST selections before. AST stands for <em>abstract syntax tree</em>, which means that the IDE will take the current language’s syntax into account for modifying the selection. Finally, I picked up <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>left</kbd>/<kbd>right</kbd> to shrink and expand selections. Not all IDEs handle this in the same way, which can be a bit annoying, but it works well for the most frequent tasks, such as expanding the selection to enclose the current string, method, class, or HTML tag.</p>
<p><strong>Folding</strong><br>
I have started to use folding much more. For years, I have rarely used this feature that all IDEs support to a great extent. Now, I do it frequently. Folding is one of these things that are just not feasible with the mouse. Of course, if you need to fold code, <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-problem-with-code-folding/">chances are that you need to structure your code better</a>. Many organizations even apply automatic code linters that will complain when methods or classes are too long. However, I have never seen someone recommend splitting up blog posts into multiple files. The same goes for other non-code file types, such as JSON. All we have there is folding.</p>
<p>I am not saying these are the things you should start to learn now, far from it. These are the things I personally integrated deep into my workflows after doing this challenge, without choosing them deliberately, but naturally. Who knows what you will pick up.</p>
<p>Of course, some of the shortcuts I learned still seem a bit, let’s say nonessential, but a little useless knowledge never killed nobody.</p>

<p>In addition to finally breaking out of old habits and experience a real evolution of my IDE usage, there were some additional, less significant, but still delightful second-order effects.</p>
<p>As a shortcut enthusiast, I often had the problem that I needed to decide which binding to use for a particular operation and application pair. KeyCombiner’s public shortcut search helps to find out which binding is the convention for a particular operation, but it can still be tricky. For example, take the frequently used <em>Step Over</em> operation used for debugging. <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collecting/collections/public/search/?description=step+over&amp;keys=&amp;mac_keys=&amp;submit=Search">KeyCombiner shows that VSCode, Eclipse, and JetBrains IDEs all use a different default binding</a>(<kbd>F6</kbd>,<kbd>F8</kbd>,<kbd>F10</kbd>). Learning every single VSCode shortcut has freed me from this mental load of deciding what the best …</p></div></div>

            <p>Every story needs a hero. But, not all heroes are the same. Some of them have superpowers, and some are ordinary people. This story’s hero is just a regular software developer who works in a small team on a medium-size application. Our hero loves his job most of the time, except when he sends a test push notification to thousands of their customers in production, like a few minutes ago.</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/01-push-notifications.png" alt=""></p>

<p>One day, his boss came with a new project. “We need to build a new complex application for our new important customer.” Nice, our hero loves challenges! “But we need to do it fast, as we have a short deadline because they have an important marketing event!” Ok, how fast do we need to build an app? “It needs to be ready for yesterday. And it needs to be real-time and scalable!”</p>

<p>The new project is a big challenge for our hero, as he never did that kind of project. Can he even do it?</p>

<p>“You can do it,” his boss says. “I also hired a famous consultant to help you.” That’s awesome! Challenge accepted.</p>

<p>After a full-day meeting with the consultant, and a whiteboard full of weird diagrams, the plan was simple: “Just use Kubernetes!”</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/02-consultant.png" alt=""></p>

<p>But our hero doesn’t know Kubernetes. And there’s no time to learn it now. What should he do?</p>

<p>He started wondering if he is the only one who doesn’t know Kubernetes. Is he good enough for this job?</p>

<p>Our hero spent a sleepless night in front of his computer with his faithful sidekick, a rubber duck. He tried to learn as much as he can about this new technology. But he ended up more confused and tired.</p>

<h2 id="you-should-try-serverless-graphql">You should try Serverless GraphQL</h2>

<p>In the middle of the night, our hero’s faithful sidekick said, “you should try serverless GraphQL.”</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/04-try-serverless-graphql.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Was he dreaming? And what the heck is serverless GraphQL? He knows what serverless is, but what’s GraphQL?</p>

<h3 id="whats-graphql">What’s GraphQL</h3>

<p>Do you remember when Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/mark-zuckerberg-our-biggest-mistake-with-mobile-was-betting-too-much-on-html5/">said</a>, “our biggest mistake was betting too much on HTML5?” It was a long time ago, back in 2012, when HTML5 was in its early days.</p>

<p>At that moment, the Facebook mobile app was an HTML5 web app embedded in the native mobile shell. They served all the news feed updates as HTML data from the server. However, HTML5 was in its early days, and the mobile web views were not performant enough, so the app wasn’t stable and scalable enough.</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/05-fb-mobile-app.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In 2012, Facebook’s engineering team started rebuilding their mobile and switching to the native iOS and Android apps. They evaluated different options for delivering the news feed data, including RESTful services  and Facebook Query Language (FQL).</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2015/09/14/core-data/graphql-a-data-query-language/">“GraphQL: A data query language”</a> article in 2015, Lee Byron wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We were frustrated with the differences between the data we wanted to use in our apps and the server queries they required. We don’t think of data in terms of resource URLs, secondary keys, or join tables; we think about it in terms of a graph of objects and the models we ultimately use in our apps like NSObjects or JSON.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This frustration led the Facebook engineering team to rethink the way they serve data to their mobile application. Instead of returning a full model with a lot of unnecessary data, they tried to develop a new system to return only the data the application needed.</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/06-data.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In 2015, they <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2015/09/14/core-data/graphql-a-data-query-language/">announced</a> GraphQL, an open-source data query language. The idea behind GraphQL was simple, the client defines the data structure, and the server provides a JSON response with precisely the same format.</p>

<p>For example, the client wants to get the user with a specified ID. However, the application needs only the user’s name, a profile photo with a specific size, and the first five friend connections. Instead of sending two or three different requests to the RESTful API, with GraphQL, you can send a request similar to the one in the image below. And the response will be the JSON with the same structure, as you can see on the right side of the same image.</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/07-an-example.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>That sounds nice and smart. But why should our hero care about GraphQL? He doesn’t have the same problem Facebook had.</p>

<p>The problem Facebook’s engineering team had was the leading cause for inventing GraphQL. However, that’s not the only problem GraphQL solves. If you have one of the following symptoms, GraphQL might be the cure for the problems your application faces, too:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Distinct front end clients for multiple platforms, such as web and mobile, have different data requirements.</li>
  <li>Your back end serves data to your client apps from different sources. For example, your app has SQL and NoSQL databases, and it connects to some external systems.</li>
  <li>Your app has a complex state and caching managements for both front end and back end.</li>
  <li>Slow pages, especially on mobile, caused by multiple dependant HTTP requests.</li>
</ul>

<p>This list is not complete, and GraphQL can bring even more benefits to your application. Some of the main characteristics of GraphQL are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It defines a data shape. The request always specifies the response’s form, which makes requests more predictable and easier to use.</li>
  <li>It’s hierarchical. Its strict relation between objects with graph-structured data simplifies getting data from multiple sources.</li>
  <li>It’s strongly typed. It can give you descriptive error messages before you run a query.</li>
  <li>It’s a protocol, not storage. Each GraphQL field is backed by a function on the back end, which allows you to connect it to any storage you want in the background.</li>
  <li>It’s introspective. You can query the GraphQL server for the types it supports. This gives you built-in documentation and also a base for a powerful toolset.</li>
  <li>It’s version free. The shape of the data is always defined by the client’s request, which means adding additional fields to your model will not affect your client application until you change the query itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>To combine data from multiple sources using RESTful API, you often send multiple HTTP requests and then connect data on the client-side. This works fine in perfect conditions. However, users don’t always use your app in ideal conditions. They are often on mobile with a limited or unstable network. Or they live in Australia, and each request is a few hundred milliseconds slower.</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/08-multiple-data-sources.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>With GraphQL, you can archive the same with a single request. This will push a bit more load to the server-side, but that works just fine in most cases. It’s even better when you don’t own the server.</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/09-graphql-request.gif" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="where-to-start-with-graphql">Where to start with GraphQL</h3>

<p>With GraphQL, you start by shaping your data using types. For example, if you are building a blog, you will have an author and a post, similar to the following code snippet. Each post will have its id, a name, a title, and an author. Authors have their ids, names, and a list of their posts.</p>

<p>As you can see, types also define a relation between an author and posts.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span><span> </span><span>Author</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>id</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Int</span><span>
  </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>String</span><span>
  </span><span>posts</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>Post</span><span>]</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>

</span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>Post</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>id</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Int</span><span>
  </span><span>title</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>String</span><span>
  </span><span>text</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>String</span><span>
  </span><span>author</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Author</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once you have types, you can build your GraphQL schema. In the code snippet below, we define two queries: get author by ID and get posts by title. Each of these queries defines input parameters with their types and a return type.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span><span> </span><span>Query</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>getAuthor</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Int</span><span>):</span><span> </span><span>Author</span><span>
  </span><span>getPostsByTitle</span><span>(</span><span>titleContains</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>String</span><span>):</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>Post</span><span>]</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>

</span><span>schema</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>query</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Query</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>As GraphQL is not storage but a protocol, we need to tell GraphQL where and how it can read the data by creating resolvers. In the following code snippet, we define two resolvers: one for the author that connects to the SQL database and one for a list of posts sends an HTTP request to the blog platform API.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>getAuthor(_, args){
  return sql.raw('SELECT * FROM authors WHERE id = %s', args.id);
}

posts(author){
  return request(`https://api.blog.io/by_author/${author.id}`);
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, we can run the query. As we defined queries, we can ask for an author by their ID. Relations allow us to get a list of all author’s posts in the same request. And if we ask for the author’s name for each blog post, that name will be the same as the author’s name above because it points to the same author.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>getAuthor</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>){</span><span>
    </span><span>name</span><span>
    </span><span>posts</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
      </span><span>title</span><span>
      </span><span>author</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
        </span><span># this will be the same as the name above</span><span>
        </span><span>name</span><span>
      </span><span>}</span><span>
    </span><span>}</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once we run the query, GraphQL will parse the request, then validate the types and data shape, and finally, if the first two steps are correct, it will run the query and our resolvers. Once we receive the data, it’ll look similar to the following JSON data:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Slobodan"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"posts"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[{</span><span>
    </span><span>"title"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"The power of serverless GraphQL with AppSync"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"author"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
      </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Slobodan"</span><span>
    </span><span>}</span><span>
  </span><span>},</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"title"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Handling webhooks with EventBridge, SAM and SAR"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"author"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
      </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Slobodan"</span><span>
    </span><span>}</span><span>
  </span><span>}]</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>By GraphQL specification, queries read the data. GraphQL specification also defines mutations and subscriptions. Mutations modify the existing data (i.e., add a new author or edit post), and subscriptions can notify you whenever the data is changed (i.e., it’ll run whenever the post is published).</p>

<h3 id="why-do-we-need-serverless-graphql">Why do we need serverless GraphQL?</h3>

<p>“You can always deploy your GraphQL using Kubernetes and write your resolvers by hand,” the rubber duck said, “but there’s an easier way.”</p>

<p>GraphQL makes retrieving your data from the client-side effortless, but you still need to manage and scale your infrastructure. And now, you have one central place that controls all of your requests. Unless you do the same you do with the other web applications – make your application serverless. Serverless GraphQL brings the best of both worlds: GraphQL makes you client-to-server connection effortless, and serverless simplifies maintenance of your infrastructure.</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/10-scaling.png" alt=""></p>

<p>“Interesting, but how do I make GraphQL application serverless?”</p>

<p>“There are many ways to do that,” the rubber duck said. “You can do that manually using the familiar serverless services. For example, on AWS, you can use Amazon API …</p></div></div></div></div>

<![CDATA[Why the Release of Ruby 3 Will Be Monumental]]>

<br/>
November 15, 2020 | https://www.ruby3.dev/the-art-of-code/2020/11/12/ruby-3-monumental/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.ruby3.dev/the-art-of-code/2020/11/12/ruby-3-monumental/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We’ve been living in the shadow of Ruby 2 for seven years now. Seven! <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/02/24/ruby-2-0-0-p0-is-released/">Ruby 2 was released in 2013</a> (which incidentally is the same year as the initial public release of React 0.3.0!).</p>

<p>In that span of time, Ruby performance has improved <em>significantly</em> and many, many enhancements to the language have benefited a great many people and projects. We’ve seen companies using Ruby and in many cases Rails become bedrocks of developer and consumer internet infrastructure. GitHub. Shopify. Stripe. Square. AirBnB.</p>

<p>But there has also been some consternation along the way. Is Ruby really a top-tier programming language able to compete with the likes of Javascript, Python, PHP, Go, and beyond? Or was it just a DHH-fueled hype-cycle doomed to inevitable relative obscurity as other technologies and frameworks ascended in its wake? (I don’t actually believe anyone seriously thinks this any more, but you still see the stray head-scratcher whiz by on Hacker News.)</p>

<p>Now we are mere weeks away from a major new Ruby release: version 3. While Ruby 3 is an exciting update with lots of features that make it interesting both now and in the future with various point updates promising even more goodies, I think it’s the <strong>psychology</strong> of turning over from major version 2 to 3 that is most vital to the future health of the community.</p>

<p>Ruby 3 isn’t just a new version. <strong>It’s a new era.</strong></p>

<p>What does this era represent? Let’s list a few talking points I hope we’ll start to push <em>hard</em> and <em>often</em> as Rubyists:</p>

<h3 id="ruby-3-is-fast">Ruby 3 is Fast</h3>

<p>No, I don’t mean Ruby 3 suddenly got a whole lot faster than Ruby 2.7. I mean that Ruby 3 is <em>fast compared to Ruby 2</em>. It’s unfortunate that much of the “Ruby is slow” meme has been a laggard perspective stemming from people’s experiences <em>years ago</em> with the language, or an old version of Rails, or Jekyll, or…the fact is it just wasn’t the zippy experience we’re pleased to enjoy today.</p>

<p>Do we still want even better performance? Of course! But at this point, Ruby is plenty fast as compared to many other “scripting” languages. Most of the time it’s on par with Python. It’s even on par with Javascript. (What? Don’t believe me? <a href="https://css-tricks.com/comparing-static-site-generator-build-times/">Check out how similar Jekyll and Eleventy perform as static site generators.</a>) And as Nate Berskopec often reminds us, your Rails app can perform quite well with just a bit of fine-tuning, and often the typical bottlenecks lie elsewhere in the stack (database, web server, etc.)</p>

<h3 id="ruby-3-is-easy">Ruby 3 is Easy</h3>

<p>These days, you don’t need to wrestle with gem dependency hell or pray to the gods to get Ruby or a Ruby extension to compile. That was “old Ruby”. New Ruby is using a fancy-pants version manager like <code>rbenv</code> combined with Bundler 2.</p>

<p><strong>It just works.</strong></p>

<p>Truly, Ruby is the first thing I install on any new Mac or Linux machine I operate and getting things set up is a piece of cake. Installing Rails. Installing Bridgetown. Installing…whatever. It. Just. Works.</p>

<p>We also have things like Docker and WSL to make things <em>much</em> easier to accomplish on Windows machines if you get stuck wrestling with Win-native Ruby. Heck, you can upload your entire dev environment into the cloud now and use VSCode with remote extensions.</p>

<p>Are there ways Bundler and the ecosystem around Ruby versions/dependencies could be improved? No doubt. But it’s in no way any more complicated or fiddly than the world of npm/yarn, and you don’t see the angry hordes trying to burn down the barn doors over there (except maybe the Deno folks 😉).</p>

<h3 id="ruby-3-is-sleek">Ruby 3 is Sleek</h3>

<p>Ruby isn’t the best choice for all problem domains. It just isn’t. But when it comes to “standard” web development, it often <em>is</em> the best choice. It really is! Spend a few days writing NestJS + TypeORM Typescript code and then come back to Rails. It’s like a breath of fresh, sweet air. And that’s not just when you’re writing controllers or models…it goes all the way up and down the stack.</p>

<p>Ruby just makes everything <em>better</em>. Less code. Less boilerplate. Less ceremony. More streamlined. More properly object-oriented. More polished and pleasurable to read and write. Certainly one could posit there are other web frameworks/languages which have much going for them as well. Laravel is popular with PHP devs, and for good reason. Django is popular with Pythonistas. But can anyone say with a straight face that, all things being equal, PHP is a “superior” programming language to Ruby? Can anyone say that Python—taken as a whole—is more suited to building a website than Ruby is?</p>

<p>I think not. While Ruby wasn’t originally invented as a way to supercharge web development, it found its niche in the rise of such amazing projects as Rails, Rack, Jekyll, plus great APIs by Stripe and many others. It rode much of the early wave of Web 2.0 hits, and that heritage continues to benefit us today.</p>

<h3 id="ruby-3-is-here-to-stay">Ruby 3 is Here to Stay</h3>

<p>Ruby 3 isn’t just another notch on the belt of recent Ruby releases. It’s <strong>Ruby 3.0</strong>. That means we can look forward to 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and beyond. This is the beginning of a whole new era. New innovations. New patterns. Exciting ideas fusing concepts from other technologies with The Ruby Way. Fresh blood coming into the ecosystem. (Anecdotally, I’m seeing newbies plus returning old-timers jumping into Ruby-based forums and chat rooms <em>all the time</em>, and the pace of interesting new Ruby gems bursting onto the scene finally seems to be increasing after a few years of ho-hum incremental progress.)</p>

<p>The takeaway is this: Ruby 3 represents a moment when we should stand proud as Rubyists and unabashedly proclaim to the bootcamps and engineering departments of the world that we’re open and ready to do business large and small. Sure you could pick something other than Ruby with which to build the next great internet success story. But you’ll definitely be in good company if you do pick Ruby. After all, it’s more likely than not your code will be living in a repository overseen by Ruby (GitHub), you’ll be communicating with your fellow colleagues via Ruby (Basecamp &amp; HEY), you’ll be asking for support via Ruby (Discourse forums), you’ll be researching the latest developer news and techniques via Ruby (Dev.to), and you’ll be spinning up your dev machine while wearing that l33t geek t-shirt you got from an indie vendor via Ruby (Shopify)—that is, after you paid for it via Ruby (Stripe). And when you’re exhausted from all that coding and need to unwind at a private cottage by the beach, Ruby will help you out there too (AirBnB).</p>

<p><em>Excelsior!</em></p>

<p>
or <b>Better Digital Living By Making Things Harder For Yourself</b><br>
or <b>I spent a Year Without Facebook and Google - Here's What Happened Next</b><br>
</p>

<p><em>Autumn 2020</em></p>


<p>
It's easy to grow disillusioned with tech, even to the point that it 
appals you. I've been using computers since 1988 and the net since 1995
and over time, something's happened. During the last decade or so, my 
mind has increasingly been preoccupied with the following thoughts:
</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm no longer in control of my computer and my OS.</li>
<li>The modern web is a cesspool of tracking scripts, ads, 
malware and clickbait designed to suck you in and make you stupid.</li>
<li>Even the most premium commercial software and hardware more often
than not comes with contraptions to spy on you.</li>
<li>"Cloud apps" are replacing programs I'd much rather run natively.</li>
<li>Thus, we sacrifice our privacy and intellects for faux conveniences.</li>
<li>The Idealist Net we fondly remember is long dead and unlikely to come
back.</li>
<li>...but there are still pockets of sanity left.</li>
</ul>

<p>
As a child of the home computer boom, I'm used to general purpose 
machines that do my bidding without interference from neither the 
manufacturer nor some unknown other wanting to sell me Depends and 
Bitcoins. That's what I want my computing to <i>still</i> be like.
</p>

<p>
The Man wants something different, though. The Man wants you to log in, 
click accept, sell your soul and Buy More Stuff. Hence, working to avoid 
that must be some level of subversive computing: Sticking it to The Man, 
one bit at a time.
</p>

<p>
In this text, I'll try to outline how I do my best to achieve that. Fair 
warning: it doesn't come without what some would call sacrifice, because 
you can't have the cake and eat it. This "sacrifice", however, might 
ultimately turn out to be beneficial.
</p>

<h2>What I absolutely do not use</h2>

<h3>Facebook</h3>

<p>
This is a dead giveaway, of course. No facebook and no facebook services 
(E.G. instagram, whatsapp, messenger, etc).
</p>

<p>
Quitting was, considering the circumstances, very easy. I'd had a 
facebook account since 2007 and I used to live there, sometimes posting 
several times a day and checking in much more often. In the summer of 
2019, I wrote a goodbye post and the day after, I closed my account. 
This is more than a year ago now and I don't miss it.
</p>

<p>
I had an Instagram account for a while, but only used it for maybe a 
month or two. It's the second stupidest "service" available on the net 
right now, and that's saying a lot: It is, quite literally, a site 
where millions of people post daily photos of their dinners. To put it 
as nicely as I can: Instagram has absolutely zero content of any kind of 
real importance to anyone.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> None, really. It turns out that people who are 
interested in meeting with or talking to you will send an email or text 
or perhaps even call you. I'm also particularly thankful I didn't have to
witness the COVID-19 debacle unfold on social media.
</p>

<h3>Twitter</h3>

<p>
Beating Instagram, Twitter is currently the stupidest site on the net. 
Best described as a slowly decomposing swamp of infighting and political 
bickering, it's full of people who will not yield a millimeter in any 
direction and will never, ever change their opinions about anything.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> None. Ditching twitter is something I advice 
everyone to do, even those who will gladly sell their DNA for a bit of 
"free" online convenience. You'll feel much more at peace with the world 
without it.
</p>

<h3>Google</h3>

<p>
If facebook is a dead giveaway, this is the truly crucial part of the 
concept. Facebook deals with distractions - Google deals with 
infrastructure. No longer one of many actors on the net, their monopoly 
quite simply dictates what goes and what doesn't. A recent reminder was 
when their domain blacklisting suddenly identified 
pouet.net, an innocent site for discussing the demo scene, as a spreader 
of malware. Things were, as usual, only resolved because someone knew 
someone who worked at Google. To discourage their thuggish, predatory 
behavior, we should avoid them in any way possible.
</p>

<p>
I closed down my Google account together with my Facebook account. I 
haven't missed that one, either. I also switched to searching with 
DuckDuckGo. The major point here is to <i>not</i> find a "replacement 
Google", such as Office 365 and Onedrive. That's not taking back control 
over your data, that's just handing it to the next buffoon for continued 
mining.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> I now pay for my email. A mom-and-pop hosts it 
all for a very reasonable yearly fee and they throw in some pretty 
decent web hosting, too. Complete self-hosting would of course be ideal 
from a privacy standpoint, but I'm happy with this solution. I can also 
mount the home directory through sshfs, which makes it an excellent 
"cloud drive". When I've been in contact with their customer support,
they've been timely, friendly, efficient and professional.
</p>

<p>
All things considered, it's probably nowhere near as safe 
from third-party intrusion and reliable against service outage as 
the Google equivalent, but then again I didn't use Google Drive for
anything important, either. That's what my hard drives and USB sticks are for. 
Don't hand over the stuff that matters to third parties if you can avoid 
it.
</p>

<p>
<b>Caveat:</b> Some people might actually need Google Docs for work, because 
employers like to force their employees into certain ecosystems. I'm 
forced into other ecosystems by mine, see
<a href="#tacs">Tradeoffs and Concessions</a>
below. The best option in these cases is of course to use it exclusively for 
work, exclusively on your work computer and in a separate web browser if
possible.
</p>

<h3>Many more sites</h3>

<p>
There are tons of sites, services and apps I don't use, for example 
Paypal and Dropbox. In fact, I avoid most sites where I have to register 
an account.
</p>

<h3>Phone Apps</h3>

<p>
My employer supplies me with a smartphone. On it I keep only the apps I 
need for work and banking. When commuting was still a thing, I also 
listened to Spotify. Other than that, I try to use it as little as 
possible these days. I do carry it with me, though: it mostly works fine 
as a phone and mobile phones are pretty damn convenient.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> I've never been fond of having a lot of apps.
Most of them are pointless and solve completely invented problems.
</p>

<h3>My local newspaper</h3>

<p>
I used to pay for an online subscription, until I just decided to stop 
one day. Apart from the poor quality of journalism, the biased reporting and 
the insipid editorial texts, I was basically paying money to keep feeding 
the online ad machine. That's a no-go.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> It's probably a reasonable idea to keep somewhat 
informed about current events. <a href="#news">See "News" below.</a>
</p>

<h2>Things I do use</h2>

<h3>Linux</h3>

<p>
In terms of user empowerment, even Canonical's Ubuntu with its telemetry 
and mysterious snap packages is so far a much better choice than any 
proprietary home computer OS on the market. From a privacy standpoint, 
other distributions, such as Debian and Slackware, are of course even 
better.
</p>

<h3>Native software</h3>

<p>
Turns out there are plenty of good programs that can be used completely 
offline and will let you store your files locally. They're not even hard 
to find. A few tips: Abiword, GNumeric, The Gimp, WordGrinder, 
Audacious.
</p>


<h3>The Web</h3>

<h4>The web, method one: Links2</h4>

<p>
The web still has good parts and I want to get at those good parts. 
Turns out the really good parts are usually remnants of The Old Web, 
consisting of HTML and great content.
</p>

<p>
I try to do as much web browsing as possible in Links2. It's a fast, 
lean browser with zero support for JavaScript and CSS. The latter means 
some sites look a bit funky. The former means some sites won't work at 
all. My usual strategy for sites that won't render without JavaScript is 
to simply ignore them. If they can't produce something worthwhile 
without scripting, it's probably not worthwhile at all.
</p>

<p>
On the plus side, no JavaScript means that most trackers and other spy- 
and malware just won't run at all. Since Links doesn't save <i>any</i> 
cookies between sessions, other means of tracking will at least be kept 
somewhat confused. The flip side is that it's probably an extremely 
unique browser fingerprint.
</p>

<h4>The web, method two: RSS and native applications</h4>

<p>
You can subscribe to Youtube channels, subreddits and pretty much every 
blog out there using RSS. There are also plenty of specialized TUI:s and 
CLI:s for interfacing with various popular websites such as Youtube and 
Reddit.
</p>

<h4>The web, method three: Firefox with UBlock Origin</h4>

<p>
For some things, like banking and filing taxes, the Internet really has 
made things so much more convenient I don't want to live without them. 
Although my bank could easily provide the services I use completely 
without a single line of JavaScript, they have decided not to. This also 
goes for most online shopping. For these types of sites, I use Firefox.
</p>

<h3>Youtube</h3>

<p>
There's still plenty of worthwhile content published on Youtube, not 
least recordings of demo scene productions for obscure hardware.
</p>

<p>
I watch Youtube using my own <a href="https://www.datagubbe.se/yt">tube script</a> in 
combination with a media player. It's not ideal, since Google will be 
able to infer a bit about my habits through my IP (although that could 
of course be mitigated using a VPN) and some videos don't work due to 
various restrictions imposed by their creators (or copyright laws). 
Somewhere around 90% of them do though, especially the interesting 
ones such as Computerphile and Numberphile. The upside is freedom from 
ads and algorithmic "recommendations": I watch only the videos I really 
want to watch.
</p>

<h3>Wikipedia</h3>

<p>
Still a useful and usable site.
</p>

<h3 id="news">News</h3>

<p>
Most of the content produced by news media is either clickbait or some 
kind of "commentary" by "experts" on actual headline news, which can 
then be milked for another couple of days. More often than not, the 
reporting is either misinformed, or biased, or both. Still, keeping 
somewhat updated can be beneficial for private decision making and 
overall …</p></div></div>

				<p>(Photo by <strong><a href="https://www.pexels.com/@sulimansallehi?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels">Suliman Sallehi</a></strong> from <strong><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/grey-concrete-structure-1481829/?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels">Pexels</a>)</strong></p><p>(<strong>Warning</strong>: This is not a climate denial post, it's my reflection on the state of current affairs)</p><p>The idea of Climate Change doesn't seem to have product-market fit. They've marketed it hard and for decades but it's not really taking off. They've held multiple conferences with a range of &nbsp;popular or obscure characters as keynote speakers, tried bundling it with other products, and made some pretty good cartoons and movies about. And yet society as a whole's doesn't seem to be buying it.</p><p>No one cares about the fact that Climate Change is happening and accelerating. Not really.</p><p>Don't get me wrong - there's lot's of talk <em>about</em> caring about Climate Change, but the real issue is not being seriously address by anyone. Let me explain.</p><h2 id="in-politics-climate-change-is-just-gang-sign-or-pom-poms-">In politics, Climate Change is just gang-sign. Or pom-poms.</h2><p>Climate change is often mentioned in political discussions and, for some reason, seems to be a largely partisan issue, specifically in the Western world. </p><p>It's an excellent tool to signal your affiliation. You see, if you paint it one colour, you can use it as a patch on your conservative jacket. Go Reds! When you paint it another, it's great insignia for your liberal banners. Go Blues! What colour words you use tells other people which gang you belong to.</p><p>For politicians Climate Change is mostly taken seriously as a tool too rile their base. It's very useful to shake around and manipulate your team's spirit. Rah-rah-rah!</p><p>For the conservatives, you're expected to doubt it's veracity, or at the very least, play down its seriousness. Conservative-lites, for instance, will very vaguely argue that technology and human ingenuity will eventually help us all coast this annoying artifact of progress. Full-fat conservatives will go whole-hog and <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-skeptics-want-more-co2/">argue it'll be of net benefit to society</a>.</p><p>On the liberal side they have their own range of cheers. Liberal-lites are very keen on raising taxes on production, which they argue would somehow help cool down the world. Full-fat liberals try to use Climate Change as an argument for going communist, because we all know communist societies won't engage in any industrialised production.</p><p>But both sides merely skirt around the issue when it comes down to it. It's merely one string connected to the levers which make their supporters dance. And it's often used as a more palatable brand to be wrapped like a mask over schemes that try and force action of other, unrelated kinds, that they know would not have broader public appear.</p><h2 id="for-large-orgs-it-s-press-release-porn">For large Orgs, it's press release porn</h2><p>Then there's the giant multinationals and intergovernmental organisations. They love to throw around the words "Climate" or "Environmentally friendly" too. It's excellent press-release porn.</p><p>There's a regular, periodic drip of kumbaya-like statements from these hydras, with vague expressions of their "great concerns" and "action needing to be taken". The young folks loves that shit, right? </p><p>You see, a well-crafted press release is amazing for creating the illusion of action. It's excellent moral insurance cover. "We often spoke about our concerns, with quite a lot of words and various agreeable degrees of sternness."</p><p>Then there's the epic events. Climate Change is a pretty rad reason to organise those. They have them often. Fly a whole bunch of delegates to this expensive venue in that remote country. There's lots of food and freebies, well-lit stages, fancy hotels and banquets. The pamphlets and banners with their tastefully designed artwork make for excellent photo-op backdrops. The world needs to see how much these very important organisations and their people care. </p><p>For-profit organisations also know how to use Climate Change effectively. It's marketing gold - so hot right now! It's a very effective tool to justify asking for more money while giving less in return. Tell your customers it's for the good of the colony! That charger that you now need to buy separately will surely save us all.</p><p>My point is of course that when it comes to Climate Change<em>,</em> the leaders of our societies, even the ones that don't outright deny that it's happening, all shout out slogans, make speeches, and then recede into the shadows of bureaucracy.</p><p>"Showing support" is easy, cheap and keeps the masses content. No serious thought or action is being mustered into how we're <em>actually</em> going to deal with the arrival of this c<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-climate-change-report-human-civilization-at-risk-extinction-by-2050-new-australian-climate/">ivilisation-ending threat</a>. </p><p>Some parts of some governments <em>are</em> actually thinking about it, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/2/24/21145687/climate-change-usa-military-book-interview">like the militaries,</a> but for the rest it's just lip service.</p><p>"COVID!", you might retort, "showed us that governments <em>can</em> take swift and decisive action! So there's hope! We just need to vote more and start grass-roots movements!"</p><p>Well, sure, governments did take action with COVID. But most of them took too little action too late. And let's not even go into the mad-surge of power grabbing that happened - the rights being sacrificed on the altar of Security. Or my own government taking the opportunity to elevate corruption and state-looting to new, ever-refined heights.</p><p>But sure, let's simplify it and just consider the fact that action was taken. The problem is that action was only taken when the sparks began to fly. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/15/revealed-the-inside-story-of-europes-divided-coronavirus-response">Action was taken when the viruses were at the gate</a>. Rome had to fall before anyone felt bothered enough to get up.</p><p>Another example of when people collectively decided to take mass action was with the BLM protests. Or the recent electoral battle between the two old men in the US. Magnificent events, for sure. The people made their voices heard. </p><p>But on closer consideration, doesn't it simply add more evidence to my assertion that nobody really believes in Climate Change? It's clearly not deemed important enough to warrant similar such action.</p><p>Well, that's not really true, I guess. </p><p>There was the Climate Change protests in 2019, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2019_climate_strikes#:~:text=The%20September%202019%20climate%20strikes,place%20from%2020%E2%80%9327%20September.&amp;text=The%2020%20September%20protests%20were,climate%20strikes%20in%20world%20history.">Global Week for Future</a>. Let's be honest though, nothing really came of that. Lot's of noise was made, lots of fun chanting. School was skipped, selfies were taken. Camaraderie was felt, but <em>actual</em> change was as good as being on holiday. And ever so swiftly, with the emergence of the virus shenanigans, Greta &amp; co also faded into the background.</p><p>Then there's the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_Rebellion">Extinction Rebellion</a>. They're hard core. Excellent name too, really catchy. Too extreme for mainstream narratives though, too aggressive and offensive. You can't run feel-good stories after covering that lot. The responsible media can't support such hooliganism.</p><p>So I admit, there <em>were</em> social movements trying to rouse society into action, but they lost steam and fizzled out. Not enough traction. Not compelling enough. Just a fad. No product-market fit.</p><p>I've been thinking about this for quite a while. It's a recurring theme when reading some of the comments on Reddit and HackerNews when the weekly Climate horror threads bubble up. Is it hopelessness, disbelief, distant consequences or laziness? </p><p>Because i<a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/3041/beating-back-the-tides/">t's</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/11/201109152241.htm">not</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/nov/13/rising-levels-of-carbon-dioxide-increasing-extreme-weather-events-in-australia-report-finds">due</a> <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/hurricane-eta-storm-2020-climate-change-b892557.html">to</a> <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/arctic-sea-ice-level-climate-change-global-warming-siberia-b1345792.html">a</a> <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/10/08/russian-scientists-find-powerful-ever-methane-seep-arctic-ocean/">lack</a> <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/3008/stunning-forecast-a-century-of-ice-loss-for-nearly-100000-glaciers/">of</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-75481-z">evidence</a>.

<p>
If you have participated in a discussion about Elixir, you may have heard “you may not need Redis with Elixir”. Given that Redis has many use cases, this sentence may confuse developers as they try to match Elixir’s different features against Redis’ capabilities. This article aims to explore different scenarios where the above is true, when they are not, and which trade-offs you may want to consider. We will discuss four cases:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
<a href="#post-pubsub">Distributed PubSub</a>  </li>
  <li>
<a href="#post-presence">Presence</a>  </li>
  <li>
<a href="#post-caching">Caching</a>  </li>
  <li>
<a href="#post-async">Asynchronous processing</a>  </li>
</ol>
<p>
Before we start, I want to emphasize we find Redis a fantastic piece of technology. This is not a critique of Redis but rather a discussion of the different options Elixir developers may have available.</p>
<h2 id="post-pubsub">
  Case #1: Distributed PubSub</h2>
<p>
The first scenario where you may not need Redis with Elixir is Distributed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern">PubSub</a>. Throughout this section, we will consider PubSub systems to provide <strong>at-most-once delivery</strong>: they broadcast events to the currently available subscribers. If a subscriber is not around, they won’t receive the message later.</p>
<p>
For this reason, PubSub systems are often paired with databases to offer persistence. For example, every time someone sends a message in a chat application, the system can save the contents to the database and then broadcast it to all users. This means everyone connected at a given moment sees the update immediately, but disconnected users can catch up later.</p>
<p>
Imagine that you have multiple nodes, and you want to exchange messages between said nodes. In Elixir, thanks to the Erlang VM, which ships with distribution support, this can be as simple as:</p>
<pre><code><span>for</span><span> </span><span>node</span><span> </span><span>&lt;-</span><span> </span><span>Node</span><span>.</span><span>list</span><span data-group-id="8737372369-1">(</span><span data-group-id="8737372369-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="8737372369-2">do</span><span>
  </span><span>send</span><span data-group-id="8737372369-3">(</span><span data-group-id="8737372369-4">{</span><span>:known_name</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>node</span><span data-group-id="8737372369-4">}</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>:hello_world</span><span data-group-id="8737372369-3">)</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="8737372369-2">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
In <a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_pubsub/blob/master/lib/phoenix/pubsub.ex">200LOC or less</a>, you can implement a PubSub system that broadcasts to all subscribers within the same node or anywhere else in a cluster, without bringing any third-party tools. At best, you will need <a href="https://github.com/bitwalker/libcluster">libcluster</a> - an Elixir library - to establish the connection between the nodes based on some strategy (K8s, AWS, DNS, etc.).</p>
<p>
In other words, PubSub pretty much ships out of the box with Elixir. Technologies without distribution would need to rely on Redis PubSub, PostgreSQL Notifications, or similar to achieve the same.</p>
<p>
Of course, the above assumes your infrastructure allows you to directly establish connections between nodes, which may not be possible in some PaaS, such as Heroku. In those cases, you can use any of the technologies above (Phoenix <a href="https://dashbit.co/blog/github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_pubsub_redis/">has a Redis adapter</a> for its PubSub), or alternatively use platforms, such as <a href="https://www.gigalixir.com/">Gigalixir</a>, that make it trivial to setup a cluster.</p>
<h2 id="post-presence">
  Case #2: Presence</h2>
<p>
Presence is the ability to track who is connected in a cluster right now — the “who” may be users, phones, IoT devices, etc. For example, if Alice is connected to node A, she wants to see that Bob is also available, even if he has joined node B.</p>
<p>
Presence is one of the problems that are more complicated to implement than it sounds. For example, let’s consider implementing Presence by storing the connected entities in a database. However, what happens if a node crashes or leaves the cluster? Because the node crashed, all the users connected to it must be removed, but the node itself cannot do so. Therefore the other nodes need to detect those failure scenarios and act accordingly. But observing failures in a distributed system is also complicated: how do you differentiate between a temporarily unresponsive node from one that permanently failed?</p>
<p>
Another common approach to solve this problem is to frequently write to a database while users are connected. If you have seen no writes within a timeframe, you consider those users to be disconnected. However, such solutions have to choose between being write-intensive or inaccurate. For instance, let’s say that users become disconnected after 1 minute. This means that you need to write to the database every 1 minute for every user. If you have 10k users, that’s 167 writes per second, only to track that the users are connected. Meanwhile, the gap between a user leaving and having their status reflected in the UI is, in the worst-case scenario, also 1 minute. Any attempt at reducing the number of writes implies an increased gap.</p>
<p>
Given Elixir’s clustering support, we can once more implement <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Presence.html">Presence</a> without a need for third-party dependencies! We use a PubSub system to implement Presence, as we need to notify as users join and leave. Instead of relying on centralized storage, the nodes directly communicate and exchange information about who is around. This removes the need for frequent writes. When a user leaves, this is also reflected immediately.</p>
<p>
So while you can use Redis or another storage to provide Presence, Elixir can deliver a solution that is efficient and doesn’t require third-party tools.</p>
<h2 id="post-caching">
  Case #3: Caching</h2>
<p>
The solutions to previous cases were built on top of Erlang’s unique distribution capabilities. In the following sections, the distinguishing factor between needing Redis or not will be <strong>multi-core concurrency</strong>, so this discussion is more generally applicable. Therefore, when we say Elixir in this section, it will also apply to JVM, Go, and other environments. They will contrast to Ruby, Python, and Node.js, in which their primary runtimes do not provide adequate multi-core concurrency within a single Operating System process.</p>
<p>
Let’s start with the non-concurrent scenario. Consider you are building a web application in Ruby, Python, etc. To deploy it, you get two eight-core machines. In languages that do not provide satisfactory multi-core concurrency, a common option for deployment is to start 8 instances of your web application, one per core, on each node. Overall, you will have CxN instances, where C is the number of cores, and N is the number of nodes.</p>
<p>
Now consider a particular operation in this application that is expensive, and you want to cache its results. The easiest solution, regardless of your programming environment, is to cache it in memory. However, given we have 16 instances of this application, caching it in memory is suboptimal: we will have to perform this expensive operation at least 16 times, one for each instance. For this reason, it is widespread to use Redis, Memcached, or similar for caching in environments like Ruby, Python, etc. With Redis, you would cache it only once, and it will be shared across all instances. The trade-off is that we are replacing memory access by a network round-trip, and the latter is orders of magnitude more expensive.</p>
<p>
Now let’s consider environments with multi-core concurrency. In languages like Elixir, you start one instance per node, regardless of the number of cores, since the runtime will share memory and efficiently spread the work across all cores. When it comes to caching, keeping the cache in-memory is a much more affordable scenario, as you will only have to compute once per node. Therefore, you have the <em>option</em> to skip Redis or Memcached altogether and avoid network round-trip.</p>
<p>
Of course, this depends on how many nodes you are effectively running in production. Luckily, many companies report being able to <a href="https://dev.to/erlangsolutions/why-elixir-is-the-programming-language-you-should-learn-in-2020-5g00">run Elixir with an order of magnitude less nodes</a> than technologies they have migrated from.</p>
<p>
You can also choose a mixed approach and store the cache both in-memory and in Redis. First, you look up in memory and, if missing, you fallback to Redis. If unavailable in both, then you execute the operation and cache it in each. The critical part to highlight here is that multi-core environments give you more flexibility to tackle these problems while reducing resource utilization. In Elixir/Erlang, you can also keep the cache in memory and use PubSub to distribute it across nodes. You can see this last approach in action <a href="https://github.com/tompave/fun_with_flags">in the excellent FunWithFlags library</a>.</p>
<p>
Another trade-off to consider is that all in-memory cache will be gone once you deploy new nodes. Therefore, if you need data to persist across deployments, you will want to use Redis as a cache layer, as detailed above, or dump the cache in a storage, such as database, S3, or Redis, before each deployment.</p>
<h2 id="post-async">
  Case #4: Asynchronous processing</h2>
<p>
Another scenario you may not need Redis in Elixir is to perform asynchronous processing. Let’s continue the discussion from the previous case.</p>
<p>
In environments without or with limited multi-core concurrency, given each instance is assigned to one core, they are limited in their ability to handle requests concurrently. This has led to a common saying that “you should avoid blocking the main thread”. For example, imagine that your application has to deliver emails on sign up or generate some computationally expensive reports. While one of your 16 web instances is doing this, it cannot handle other incoming requests efficiently. For this reason, a common choice here is to move the work elsewhere, typically a background-job processing queue. First, you store the work to be done on Redis or similar. Then one of the 16 web instances (or more commonly a completely different set of workers) grabs it from the queue.</p>
<p>
In multi-core concurrent environments, requests can be handled concurrently regardless if they are doing CPU or IO work. Sending the email from the request itself won’t block other requests. Generating the report is not a problem, as requests can be served by other CPUs. These platforms typically get assigned as many requests as they can handle and they distribute the work over the machine resources. Even if you prefer to deliver emails outside of the request, in order to send an earlier response to users, you can spawn an asynchronous worker without a need to move the delivery to an external queue or to another machine. Once again, concurrency gives us a more straightforward option to tackle these scenarios.</p>
<p>
Note the Erlang VM takes care of multiplexing CPU and IO work without a need for developers to tag functions as async or similar. Workers in Erlang/Elixir are …</p></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

  </header>
  <p>I have a small side project: <a href="https://hacker.gifts/">digital gift cards for hackers</a>. It uses Shopify for all the store-related stuff: frontend, payments, refunds, reports, etc.</p>

<p>But unlike regular digital products (ebooks, videos) I wanted each card that the user purchases from the store to be unique. So I made a  script that generates personalized images and ran it manually for every order.</p>

<p>The next logical step was automating this process. I started with serverless AWS Lambda. At the time it was the hot new tech and I wanted to learn more. It seemed very fitting for my use-case: single-responsibility functions that can run at any time and don’t require server maintenance.</p>

<p><img src="https://frantic.im/assets/back-to-rails/simple-lambda.png" alt=""></p>

<p>It was super easy to get started. I built a JavaScript function and deployed it to AWS Lambda, added Shopify web hook and it all worked!</p>

<p>Early benefits of serverless (for hobby projects):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Easy to get started</li>
  <li>Don’t have to configure or maintain servers</li>
  <li>Free for small loads</li>
</ul>

<p>In reality, writing the simple Lambda functions turned out to be only 10% of the work.</p>

<p>Time passed and my backend started getting more complex: I needed to store some state for each <a href="https://hacker.gifts/products/space-invaders">puzzle</a>, send confirmation emails, show an order details page. What started as a simple function, grew into a bunch of serverless functions, SNS topics, S3 buckets, DynamoDB tables. All bound together with plenty of YAML glue, schema-less JSON objects passed around and random hardcoded configs in AWS console.</p>

<p>I think it’s just a typical software development lifecycle: things grow organically, become a mess, and require some refactoring. Make it run first (discover market fit), then make it right (refactor to integrate the new discoveries).</p>

<p>But this time it was different. I couldn’t refactor things as easily as I used to in traditional monolithic apps. Here’s why:</p>

<p>When the building blocks are too simple, the complexity moves into the interaction between the blocks.</p>

<p>And the interactions between the serverless blocks happen <em>outside</em> my application. A lambda publishes a message to SNS, another one picks it up and writes something to DynamoDB, the third one takes that new record and sends an email…</p>

<p>I could test every single block in that flow, but I didn’t have confidence in the overall process. What if publishing fails, how would I know that? How would system recover? Can I rollback and try again? Where do the logs go?</p>

<p>Another swarm of problems was hiding in my configuration: bad Route 53 record, typos in SNS topics, wrong S3 bucket region. Tracing errors was a challenge, there’s no single log output I can look into.</p>

<p>With serverless, I was no longer dealing with my project's domain, I was dealing with the distributed system's domain.</p>

<p>At this point I felt fooled.</p>

<p>I came for the easy way to deploy code and not think about servers, but in the end had to design my system around the platform’s limitations.</p>

<p>Drawbacks of serverless (for hobby projects):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hard to follow information flow</li>
  <li>Impossible to replicate production environment locally</li>
  <li>Slow iteration speed</li>
  <li>Lack of end-to-end testing</li>
  <li>Immature documentation (dominated by often outdated Medium posts)</li>
  <li>No conventions (have to make hundreds of unessential decisions)</li>
</ul>

<p>—</p>

<p>I was clearly not enjoying the serverless. So I decided to rewrite it. After all, it is a side project I’m doing for fun. The tech stack of choice — Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>I haven’t used Rails since 2013, and for the last 8 years at Facebook I’ve been mostly doing JavaScript.</p>

<p><img src="https://frantic.im/assets/back-to-rails/logo.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The experience of picking Rails back up was really nice but… uneventful. Not much had really changed. A few things got added, a few small things moved around.</p>

<p>Of course I did <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/38060">hit some magical Ruby issues</a>. But unlike my typical experience with JavaScript, I was quickly able to find the solution.</p>

<p>Rails comes with so many things built-in and configured. Over the years, without Rails, I used to gluing random JavaScript libraries together to roll my own routing, file storage wrappers, email preview pipeline, managing secrets, test setup with fixtures, database migrations, logging, performance reporting, deployment scripts. With Rails I didn’t have to think about all these details and could simply focus on making product-visible changes.</p>

<p>It was like driving a Tesla after years of making my own scrappy cars. Similar components, but all configured and aligned to work well together.</p>

<p>Benefits of Rails (for hobby projects):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Conventions</li>
  <li>Tooling, libraries</li>
  <li>Documentation</li>
  <li>Monolith is easy to understand and test</li>
</ul>

<p>Drawbacks of Rails (for hobby projects):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Feels heavyweight in the beginning</li>
  <li>Hurts if your opinions differ from Rails conventions</li>
  <li>Have to host on a server</li>
  <li>Doesn’t sound cool in 2020 (anymore and maybe yet)</li>
</ul>

<p>—</p>

<p>Serverless is like a black hole. It promised exciting adventures, but gravity sucked me in and I spent most of my efforts dealing with its complexity, instead of focusing on my product.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Concords is an MVP framework for building offline &amp; decentralised web apps, with a file-based approach to storing data. It has no servers or databases and is a static app built with Javascript and HTML, all code is written to run in a browser and nothing is stored outside of the browser or downloaded files.</p> <p>The full MVP is available to try at <a href="https://alpha.concords.app/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">alpha.concords.app</a></p> <h2 id="why">Why?</h2> <p>SAAS applications run on servers with databases. Each interaction with the UI sends information from the browser to a server, which then likely writes something or fetches something from a centralized database.</p> <p>Maintaining servers and databases is expensive, complex and time-consuming and I'm not really interested in that side of software. I don't want the responsibility to look after data that is depended upon, that's neither my skill-set nor passion. I like to focus my attention on the front-end experience.</p> <p>I set out to build a framework for file-based SAAS apps. Multi-user collaborative apps, with data-driven user flows and advanced UI. But apps that run offline and save state to the filesystem, not send it off to a cloud-based database. Giving users full ownership and visibility of their data, with no dependency on an internet connection. Taking a progressive approach to connectivity, using it to enrich the experience, but not depend on it.</p> <h2 id="technical-steps">Technical Steps</h2> <ul> <li><p>Functional blockchain library in Typescript.</p> </li> <li><p><a href="https://svelte.dev/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Svelte</a> &amp; <a href="https://sapper.svelte.dev/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Sapper</a> for all things UI.</p> </li> <li><p>Blockchain sync with IndexedDB and reactivity hook.</p> </li> <li><p>Created <a href="https://1.0.0.concords.app/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">some mini-apps</a> to refine and test the core functionality.</p> </li> <li><p>User Authentication flow.</p> </li> <li><p><a href="https://alpha.concords.app/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MVP: Kanban app</a>.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="concords-mvp-board-app">Concords MVP: Board App</h2> <p>This MVP serves to demonstrate a basic solution to a truly offline and decentralized experience in a collaborative web app. It's a static app, so just Javascript and HTML, with no servers or databases running in the background. It's a progressive web app with a service worker, that runs entirely in the browser. So once the initial load has been performed, the rest of the experience can work completely offline, where data is stored in files, downloaded and uploaded through the UI.</p> <p>A boards app covers a lot of functionality commonly found in SAAS applications, I figured it's a great benchmark to prove out the technology.</p> <p><img alt="" src="https://concords.app/flows/add-task.gif?raw=true"></p> <hr> <h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3> <p>With Concords, authentication is all done in the browser, without any communication to a server or external resource.</p> <p>In the Concords authentication system, we issue a downloadable public profile which includes your public key and some basic user info. I keep mine for the MVP on my personal domain. <a href="https://ternent.dev/concords/sam-ternent.profile.concords.json" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ternent.dev/concords/sam-ternent.profile.concords.json</a></p> <p>Anyone with access to my public key is able to encrypt data for me, that only I can read with my private key. I just have that stored on my personal machine. It’s never been online and no-one else knows it.</p> <p>This key is used to log the user into the app and only a valid key combination can login and access the software.</p> <p>For my MVP, this is more than sufficient to complete and decent authentication flow. We can have a recognisable UX of profile/password combination to build a login system, whilst setting us up for an encrypted, multi-user, data flow.</p> <p><img alt="" src="https://concords.app/flows/signup.gif?raw=true"></p> <hr> <p>I know it's a pain to ask users to store both parts of their encryption keys themselves. If the private key is lost, it's unrecoverable and so is any encrypted data to that key. But I couldn't compromise here, it has to be this way to keep things decentralized. But it's a problem that can be fixed through software, it doesn't have to be my software - we're decentralizing things here, but key management software will fix this problem.</p> <h3 id="the-app">The App</h3> <p>Knowing roughly what I needed to build to prove out the concept, and having already implemented User Profile and the authentication flow, the key features I chose to implement were:</p> <ul> <li>Create new and multiple boards</li> <li>Downloadable app files</li> <li>Load any board, from any user</li> <li>Assign tasks to users</li> <li>Editable tasks</li> <li>Timestamped actions</li> <li>Drag to sort columns</li> <li>Draggable tasks across columns</li> <li>Soft delete tasks to the trash, with restore and remove</li> <li>Activity log with an immutable history of the board</li> </ul> <p><img alt="" src="https://concords.app/flows/create-board.gif?raw=true"></p> <hr> <h4 id="multiple-users">Multiple Users</h4> <p>By default, a new user doesn't have edit access to a document. For the purpose of the MVP, we've got a "Join" button in the left-hand sidebar. Clicking this will add the user as an entry to the data store and unlock editing. This covers the concept enough for now, but we are able to achieve direct encryption with the public/private key authentication, so that's going to be an interesting avenue to explore further outside of the MVP context.</p> <p><img alt="" src="https://concords.app/flows/third-user.gif?raw=true"></p> <hr> <h3 id="core-library">Core Library</h3> <p>The core of the framework is written in Typescript. It's a collection of functional utilities which cover the data side of the application. It runs an internal blockchain for writing data, mapped with an IndexDB instance for reading.</p> <h4 id="blockchain">Blockchain</h4> <p>At the heart of the library is the <a href="https://hackernoon.com/merkle-tree-what-is-it-and-why-use-it-8m2a63xjd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Merkel Tree</a> solution. Our Merkle Tree (as used in Blockchain and git), is a functional library to act as a blockchain node, from a JSON object structure, in the browser.</p> <p>Built on top of that is a CRUD API which the application will interface with. When an action is performed in the app, a timestamped transaction is created for the blockchain. Once commit, all pending transactions are then added to a block on the chain. Once a block has been added to the blockchain, the hash-based data structure ensures the integrity of the app state.</p> <pre><code>{

We can drop and recreate a database with complete accuracy, based on secured transactional history.

Little things like saving the hash to a keychain, directly reading and writing to the filesystem.

I'm not against storing data on the cloud, I just want to be able to make my own choice as to where. The initial standout integration I want to try is with Dropbox, syncing a folder in your filesystem to dropbox will give us the ability to introduce the "push/pull" aspect found in git.</p> <h3 id="conflict-resolution">Conflict resolution</h3> <p>I need to do further research around conflict resolution. I have the basics for a complete blockchain, which includes proof of work and consensus to ensure the validity of the underlying data structure, but it doesn't secure or handle in-app data conflicts. Visual diffs and conflicts are problems solved in various other applications, with plenty of research available. I'm not sure how it will look yet, but it should be a fun one to solve.</p> <h3 id="user-roles--permissions">User roles &amp; permissions</h3> <p>Using our data structure user roles and permissions are achievable. With the use of application-level permission keys, we can encrypt the access key for a specific user. They will then have access to any data under that permission level.</p> </section></div></div>]]>

<p><b>...or anyone else, for that matter.</b></p>

<p><i>Autumn 2020</i></p>

<p>Ask anyone who's really into cooking and they'll tell you how important it is to have a kitchen that's arranged just right. To someone who rarely cooks, a kitchen is probably just a place to store a few pots and a toaster, and the placement of such stuff doesn't matter much: canned soup and microwave dinners are designed for ease of preparation.</p>


<p>For the enthusiastic home cook, however, a lot of things can go wrong. Often there's only a second's notice to fix something that might ruin a perfect meal or set you back hours of hard toil. Hollandaise starting to split? Better bring out that ice cold water post haste! Garlic burning? Better chop some more right this instant, or the pasta will be overcooked and there goes the Aglio e Oglio.</p>


<p>To achieve speed, you have to know where your knives, pots, pans, spoons, whisks and other utensils are and you want to be able to arrange them so that they're easy to reach. Seasonings, spices, herbs and condiments should be within reach from the stove. Then there's the mise en place before the actual cooking begins: chopping all the vegetables, cubing the meat, slicing the bacon and so on.</p>


<p>All of this is, thankfully, easy to achieve. Even the most cramped kitchen will, after having been battle tested through a few meals, be as optimal as possible according to the cook's personal preference. The same goes for painters, carpenters, car mechanics and even office dwellers. Hammer missing from the hammer hook? For shame! Stapler not to the immediate right of the stack of post-its? Well it should be!</p>


<h3>The regulated kitchen</h3>


<p>Now imagine if you couldn't organize your kitchen to your heart's content. Not because you're lacking the funds or skills, but because some federally appointed clerk is constantly coming to inspect it.</p>


<p>"Nah," he says, adjusting his clip-on tie, "you can't put your spices there. Against regulations. All spices must be kept more than two yards from the stove at all times." He then goes on to explain that you'll have to call him every time you want to use the stove, just to make sure the pots you're using are compliance tested. Plus, they have to be stored in the government approved pot storage cabinet below the sink, otherwise they're not fit for kitchen use.</p>


<p>Want to change the color of the counter top? Sorry, no can do. Want to switch from glass bowls to stainless? Alas, you used to be able a few years ago, but nobody wants stainless anymore anyway, right? The salt <i>can</i> be put next to the stove, but it's not recommended and might change in the near future. Knives are now to be honed every Tuesday afternoon by a designated craftsman. Sure, you can postpone a few times, but eventually, you just have to live with that. Plus, there's going to be some dudes coming to inventory your pantry on a regular basis, most likely when you're in the middle of cooking something really complicated. There's no use in protesting - this is all for your own good.</p>

<p>And yes.


</p><p>Of course this is a metaphor for computers.</p>


<h3>The curious disappearance of configuration</h3>


<p>For the casual user, some of this can <i>maybe</i> be convenient - or at least not annoying. If someone who rarely uses the kitchen has decided to whip up a home cooked feast, it doesn't matter that the spices are kept strangely far from the stove: they're just happy they found them. And <i>maybe</i> there is, for the casual user, some "security" in lock-in efforts such as MacOS calling home<sup><a href="#footnote1">[1]</a></sup> to check if a program is allowed to run and that web browsers automatically block certain URLs.</p>


<p>Likewise, maybe a handful of confused beginners are helped by the fact that certain system settings are extremely hard to find, or that you're supposed to put all your photos in a specific directory, or that you can't decide what partition you want to install a program on, or that some indexing service starts running when you least expect it, or that not a single application gives a crap about the few color settings you're allowed to make.</p>


<p>For the power user, such things range from nuisances to something that seriously hampers productivity and creativity.</p>


<p>It used to be that whenever I got a new computer, I spent a day or two setting it up. I selected the fonts I wanted to use, I picked the colors I liked for window decorations and GUI elements, I installed my preferred tools and utilities and I organized the desktop icons and program launchers to my liking. It took a bit of time, but it was a labor of love. In times of trouble I was, if nothing else, at least the boss of my own desktop environment.</p>


<p>I don't know of any proprietary OS where I can do that anymore. Linux is, considering what's going on with the major distributions, desktop environments and UI toolkits, seemingly heading the same way. Sure, pick your own window manager, see if we care - we've got client side decorations! Want to theme your GUI? Yeah, but not in our Snap packages you won't! Want to turn off cursor blinking? Mmmmyyeeaahhh, not too sure about that. Oh, you started a GUI file manager? Hey, enjoy the ten new folders we've littered your home directory with! They all start with capital letters: designed for typing convenience in a case sensitive file system.</p>


<p>Of course I still spend a fair amount of time setting up a Windows machine, but these days it's not the joyful experience of configuring the best fonts and nicest colors and arranging the icons on the start menu in the correct order for my muscle memory. Instead it's usually a week of swearing over removed settings and working hard to find the ones that actually remain, or trying various registry hacks to circumvent seemingly unchangeable defaults. I'm working against the system instead of with it, and someone else is trying to boss me around.</p>


<h3>A better example</h3>


<p>All of this could be different. It used to be. On my Amiga, I could configure <i>everything</i>. Apart from things like fonts and colors I could draw my own mouse pointer, tiling desktop backgrounds and icons. (Yes, the system really shipped with separate little paint programs just for pointers, desktop tiles and icons.) I could customize double click speed and key repeat rates on millisecond levels. I could even control the exact position of individual icons and the size and position of every individual directory window opened.</p>


<p>Most casual users didn't care about all that, but they didn't have to. The system came with a reasonable set of defaults and when or if they grew more proficient and wanted to change something about their daily working environment, they had the option to do so.</p>


<p>This was a great approach to users. Instead of being treated like an incompetent moron and placed in a walled garden, you were entrusted and empowered. Something as simple as drawing my own mouse pointer on the Amiga was a profound and formative experience for me. As corny as it sounds, it was as if the guys who built this amazing machine put it in my hands and said, "Hey kid, you're in charge. This computer is yours. Learn how to use it and you can make it do anything." It was a call for exploration and creativity.</p>


<p>Today, I can't even change the system font in Windows. I can select an "accent color", but most applications completely ignore it. Every program defaults to downloading into a Downloads folder and I've lost count of how many times I've changed its folder view from grouped to not grouped, only to discover it's been magically changed back the next time I browse it. Lots of settings have been removed completely while others are buried deep in strange places where a user clearly isn't really supposed to venture.</p>


<p>The problem is that there's no toggle for enabling "advanced mode". I'm just supposed to accept that I can no longer change simple things I've been able to configure for the past thirty years. Someone, somewhere just decided that all users have the same basic skill level and that the defaults are always acceptable.</p>


<h3>General purpose Instagram cameras</h3>


<p>I suppose the lack of configurability is a metaphor for personal computing in general: we're not buying our machines, we're renting them by way of bizarrely complex EULA:s for everything from the firmware to the OS and we're not supposed to be curious or creative, we're supposed to sit back and passively consume advertisements. The base level of creative computer use is no longer exploring programming or graphics or music, but photographing a meal someone else has prepared and then applying a predefined sepia filter to said photo. The base level of configuring a system is no longer picking some personal favorites among fonts and colors, but - maybe - selecting between dark and light mode.</p>


<p>
On the flip side, more and more people also need to use computers 
for actually producing stuff - not least programming all those ad 
delivery platforms and the curiously unconfigurable operating systems 
they run on. But there are also armies of innocents; office workers,
administrators, hotel clerks, librarians, teachers - those people now often 
have no choice but to strain their eyes staring at black text on bright 
white backgrounds, unable to select a font they find easier to read.
</p>

<p>Too bad they can no longer store their spices close to the stove, but hey, who cares? Let them take one for the team. We're all swimming in ad revenue and if people learn to configure things, maybe they'll suddenly realize that the presence of those ads should be configurable as well.</p>

      We need to talk.
    </p><div>

<p>Here’s a paraphrased conversation I’m having way to often, costing me way too much time, keeping me from doing things that are way more important:</p>

<pre>User: Hi, I'd like to report a bug in your application.
Me:   Great! Please open a support ticket, then.
User: But, it looks like I need to pay for that?
Me:   So?
User: I just want to tell you that your app is broken, so you can fix it.
Me:   Yes, that's a support request, please open a ticket.
User: ...
</pre>

<figure>
  <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/bugreport-free-support/bugreport.png">
    <img src="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/bugreport-free-support/bugreport.png">
  </a>
  
</figure><p>
                             
                             
From there it typically derails into a whiny tirade about me being a crappy two bit developer who doesn’t give a shit about his code (which is ridiculous, since, professional pride aside, I have every incentive to fix bugs, to prevent my inbox from getting flooded) and just wants to rip off his users.</p>

<p>In the past, I sometimes gave in (when it sounded like something might be wrong). I looked at the issue and almost always found that nothing was broken, just didn’t work as expected (which is actually to be expected for every reasonably complex piece of software). The user just didn’t bother reading the docs and tried to bypass the fee by masquerading the support request as a bug report. So, nowadays my policy simply is: no support ticket, no service. Any such request goes straight to the trash folder without even being looked at.</p>

<h2 id="why-am-i-such-an-asshole">Why am I such an asshole?</h2>

<p>Here’s the thing: I write open source software to solve <strong>my problem</strong>. I let you use my solutions because that comes at zero cost for me (well, almost, I still have to pay for the website, you are downloading from. You are welcome, by the way). I also provide the source code, so you can fix things yourself, should my solution turn out to be unsuitable. However, once you come to me with a “bugreport” that doesn’t also include a patch (or at least very precisely pinpoints the problem), then you are basically asking me to <strong>look at your problem</strong>. At this point, it is no longer zero cost for me and that’s the reason for why I am charging you money: you are asking me to spent time on your behalf. That is commonly called <strong>work</strong>. And surprisingly enough, work is what people expect to be paid for.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong. I’m happy to help. Selling support is what keeps the lights on here (did I mention the cost of running a webserver?). But coming to me under false pretense and/or expecting that I <strong>must</strong> provide free service on top of a software I gave away without charge is not going to win you any favours.</p>

<p>It stops being free, when it starts costing me! My time is valuable. If you want a piece of it, I want money in return. Period.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Seems like this post has struck a nerve and caused a few misunderstandings. <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/reactions-bugreport-free-support/">Clarification on my position here</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[Lazy Loading Explained]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


			
<p>Lazy loading is a very cool design pattern that is not often talked about. Many frameworks implement it without even telling us about it ðŸ˜Š. For example, .NET Entity Framework (all versions) support the pattern.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what is lazy loading? The idea behind the pattern is simple. By using lazy loading, we defer the initialization of objects (heavy ones) until we need them. Thatâ€™s it.</p>



<p>Letâ€™s provide an example. We have a simple HR application. The application supports the tracking of employee records. Each record has standard fields like name, email, date of birth, and image (like a profile picture), etc.</p>



<p>The application has operations like adding employees, updating employees, searching for an employee, generating reports, etc. Do all functions need the image of the employee? Should we load images in some aggregated reports? Of course not. A picture can take a lot of resources, so it is not reasonable to load it everywhere. And here, lazy loading comes to help us.</p>



<h2>Lazy loading implementation</h2>



<p>There are several ways to implement the lazy loading pattern, but we are going to inspect the most used one (when it comes to manual implementation).</p>



<p>In the source code, the employee domain model is represented like this:</p>



<pre><div><div><p><span>public</span> <span>class</span> Employee<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>string</span> Name <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>string</span> Email <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>byte</span><span>[</span><span>]</span> Image <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> Employee<span>(</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>void</span> Load<span>(</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>// LOGIC LOADING ALL THE DATA.</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span></p></div></div>

</pre>



<p>Nothing special. Just a class with three fields and a method which would load all the data. But as we said, most of the time, we do not want the Image data because it could take a lot of resources.</p>



<p>So, how do we <a href="https://ddimitrov.dev/2020/02/15/what-is-code-refactoring/">refactor</a> the class? We do It like this:</p>



<pre><div><div><p><span>public</span> <span>class</span> Employee<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>private</span> <span>byte</span><span>[</span><span>]</span> image<span>;</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>string</span> Name <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>string</span> Email <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>byte</span><span>[</span><span>]</span> Image <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>get</span> <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>if</span> <span>(</span>image <span>==</span> <span>null</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; image <span>=</span> LoadImage<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>return</span> image<span>;</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>else</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>return</span> image<span>;</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>set</span> <span>{</span> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; image <span>=</span> <span>value</span><span>;</span> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> Employee<span>(</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>void</span> Load<span>(</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>// LOGIC LOADING ONLY NAME AND EMAIL PROPERTIES.</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>byte</span><span>[</span><span>]</span> LoadImage<span>(</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>// LOGIC LOADING AND RETURNING IMAGE DATA.</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span></p></div></div>

</pre>



<p>We followed only four steps:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Extract the logic for image data load from the Load method to a new Method â€“ LoadImage;</li><li>Introduce a new private field for the image data;</li><li>Refactor the Image property to check if image data is null. If it is, the new method loads the image data, assigns it to the image field, and then return it to the consumer.</li></ol>



<p>Next time we load the object (or objects if we load a collection of them), we wonâ€™t have the overhead of loading unnecessary image data. We are going to extract the image data only when we need it (by accessing Image property).</p>



<h2><strong>ORMs</strong></h2>



<p>ORMs like <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/querying/related-data" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Entity Framework Core</a> support lazy loading. When a query is executed, not all the properties are loaded (unless you have disabled lazy loading). Only by accessing them, another query runs to fetch the data.</p>



<p>For example, imagine we have two entities in relation: a Company entity and an Employee entity. A company has many employees. If we query for a specific company by id and we get a result, the list of its employees wonâ€™t be loaded. Only when we access them a new query will fetch the collection.</p>



<p>In some cases, this is cool in others, not ðŸ˜Š.</p>



<p>Can we implement our own lazy loading if we are using some ORM? Sure. The thing you should do is not to map properties/entities that donâ€™t need to be loaded with every query. Of course, you should provide proper methods to handle the data that is not loaded.</p>



<p>In Entity Framework, you use the [NotMapped] attribute to annotate desired properties.</p>



<p>You can read in many places that lazy loading is used when accessing network resources. That is true but not complete. You can use lazy loading also for any demanding operation, like complex computations, reading big chunks of local data, etc.</p>

  <p>Back in 2012 my wife and I started a house renovation project in Edinburgh (Scotland) having moved to that great city the previous year. In our previous London abode we’d installed a wireless lighting system from a company called Rako and it worked well enough to convince us that wireless was the way to go. Now, having installed and maintained a system with over 150 wireless lighting control circuits over the past 7 years I’ve finally had to admit that my technology choice was wrong. The Z-Wave wireless lighting system I installed just doesn’t work for a home like mine. I have now ripped out almost all of the Z-Wave units I installed – which had cost me more than £6k to buy and install. Read on to see the 10 reasons I finally kicked it out and what I have now replaced it with.</p>
<h2>My career in Wireless</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.170/onv.491.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Actixlogohires-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="205" height="153" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.170/onv.491.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Actixlogohires-300x224.jpg 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.170/onv.491.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Actixlogohires-100x75.jpg 100w, https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.170/onv.491.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Actixlogohires.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 205px) 100vw, 205px">Firstly let me explain that I spent most of my career in the wireless (mobile phone) industry and consider myself to have a reasonable degree of expertise in the field. The company I founded (<a href="http://www.actix.com/">http://www.actix.com</a>) has been a leading specialist in planning and optimising new wireless technologies for the past 25 years and has developed solutions for measurement and optimisation of everything from Analog to 5G.</p>
<p>Wireless technology is behind some of the most amazing developments of the last 50 years – things like the iPhone and satellite TV. So you may find it strange that I would be doubting the ability of a leading home-automation wireless technology to do something as straightforward as turning a light on and off. But unfortunately my experience has been exactly that.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Z-Wave – The system I chose in 2012</h2>
<p>Back in 2012 I asked for recommendations from the people I knew who were Home Automation pioneers – not least <a href="https://www.devicepilot.com/about">Pilgrim Beart</a> (the founder of the Hive product <a href="https://www.hivehome.com/">https://www.hivehome.com</a> now owned by BG) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Stafford-Fraser">Quentin Stafford-Fraser</a> (co-inventor of the webcam). The consensus around the time was that one of the wireless technologies already on the market would become the de-facto standard for domestic lighting control. That seemed pretty compelling as companies like <a href="https://aeotec.com/">AeoTech,</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fibaro.com/en/">Fibaro</a>, Philips and LightwaveRF were already producing wireless lighting systems including (in the first two instances) control modules that could be retro-fitted into the pattress (wall-box) behind a light switch.</p>

<p>At that time there were essentially three main choices of wireless technology: <a href="https://www.z-wave.com/">Z-Wave</a>, <a href="https://lightwaverf.com/">LightwaveRF</a> and <a href="https://zigbeealliance.org/">ZigBee</a>. I discounted LightwaveRF as it was (still is?) very range limited and my house is an old one built almost entirely from large stone blocks (even internally) that are very good at blocking RF signals. Between Z-Wave and ZigBee there wasn’t much to choose from a wireless perspective but the decision was made for me when I looked at the manufacturer support for each technology. As mentioned above companies like AeoTech and Fibaro already had modules (devices that turn on/off or dim a circuit) on the market that I thought would be ideal for my lighting control system whereas such support for ZigBee was pretty much completely absent save a few hobbyist-level companies.</p>
<p>So I found a supplier (<a href="https://www.vesternet.com/">Vesternet</a> – who have been great by the way) and started ordering Z-Wave modules to try out. Fast-forward 18 months or so and I’d installed (with the help of a great electrician called Lorenzo) over 150 circuits with Z-Wave control. Many of the modules I installed in that period were Fibaro generation 1 dimmer and switch (relay) units. They had a few quirks but I found that if I bought the right LED lamps (mainly Philips ones) and used the balun that you can buy to compliment a Fibaro dimmer then I could get (relatively) flicker-free dimming wirelessly.</p>

Picture by Rab (Ian or Yanny) Gamble.</p></div>
<p>Since Lorenzo was replacing most of the wiring in the house I managed to get him to bring a lot of the control cables together in around five separate locations. This simplified the task of adding devices and also helped me to keep track of the actual units. To this day I have a spreadsheet with around 500 lines (around 3 lines per circuit) which details all of the lighting circuits in the house, the circuit breaker they are connected to, the type of device that controls the circuit and its location. Unfortunately I wasn’t 100% successful in getting the control point of all the lighting circuits in one of these five locations and there are actually at least three units lost in the walls somewhere which respond to Z-Wave commands but don’t seem to control anything I can find!</p>
<h2>Z-Wave Hubs</h2>
<p>Having chosen a technology and the modules to turn things on and off (or dim them) the next step is to decide on a central hub or controller as all Z-Wave networks need one of those. At the time a popular one was called <a href="https://www.vesternet.com/pages/vera-controller-comparison">Vera</a> and I initially opted for that. It had a reasonably good way of overcoming one of the problems of Z-Wave (adding a new module requires the hub and the module to be close together) which came in the form of a battery box that could power the hub while you moved it around to add modules (the AeoTech Z-Stick has a similar feature). Unfortunately Vera also had a number of downsides – a limited API to allow it to be controlled by other systems, a non-working backup system that forgot what modules had been added and a slow processor which meant adding multiple modules took a stupidly long time.</p>

<p>So began a waltz through a significant part of the available hub-landscape, taking in <a href="https://www.vesternet.com/products/z-wave-fibaro-home-center-2-system">Fibaro’s HC2 hub</a>, a Mac-based home automation app called <a href="https://www.indigodomo.com/">Indigo</a>, an open-source system called <a href="https://www.domoticz.com/">Domoticz</a> and finally <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a> (recommended by Quentin who I mentioned previously – did I tell you he co-invented the web-cam – I did – but I guess that’s cool enough to be mentioned twice – right?). Each has their own strengths and weaknesses but ultimately a lot of the problems I found with any of these systems came down to issues with Z-Wave itself and while my sashays from one to another sometimes gave me the impression of progress they generally just shifted the shadows around and left the underlying issues unresolved.</p>
<p>What did prove to be significant though was the hardware on which these systems are based. The Vera and Fibaro HC2 have their own hardware platforms which are not open and this gave me quite a bit of trouble as I tried to work though the failure concentration problem that I will attempt to explicate later. The Mac-based system was good in the sense that it was based on Mac hardware which I have found to be relatively reliable. However, it was, ironically, the failure of a Mac Mini which ultimately precipitated another switch that I had been mulling due to a lack of Z-Wave diagnostics.</p>
<p>The systems I moved to (Domoticz and then Home Assistant) were based on Raspberry Pi hardware and that has resulted in quite a few more problems – SD card corruption due to brown-outs, reboots at unfortunate times due to me attempting to automate system updates and hardware failure initiated by some circuit breaker issues I experienced.</p>
<h2>Reason 1: Z-Wave Pairing</h2>
<p>The process of adding a module to a Z-Wave network is to put the hub into “include” mode and then press a button on the module while it is close to the hub. That sounds simple enough but now imagine doing this for 150 modules scattered around a house, some behind wall-plates, others in waterproof boxes, concealed in ceilings, etc.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.170/onv.491.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/z-wave-protocol-hacking-300x157.png" alt="" width="300" height="157" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.170/onv.491.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/z-wave-protocol-hacking-300x157.png 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.170/onv.491.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/z-wave-protocol-hacking-100x52.png 100w, https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.170/onv.491.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/z-wave-protocol-hacking.png 728w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>It was quite onerous to do it once but I think I’ve probably done it on average three times for every module in the house plus quite a few more times for modules that I’ve moved around, or have failed and had to be replaced. That’s getting on for 500 include processes. And that’s just to get the module visible to the system. Once it is included you generally have to locate the specific function(s) of the module you want to use (e.g. a motion sensor might have a temperature reading, a light-level and an alarm setting in addition to the motion detection function), then you give each function a name, then you need to indicate what room it is in, then you might want to group it with other module functions (so, for instance, a mood setting in the dining room sets the light levels on five different modules via a scene or group). All of that needs to be typed in and you will generally be doing this while wandering around, so you will do it on a laptop or tablet and sometimes up a ladder or in a cupboard.</p>
<p>I have now gotten to the stage where I dread some modules failing. The one that controls a water-feature in the garden is in a sealed box, the one that controls an out-door heater is in a small loft area that can only be accessed by a rickety ladder, the one for the guest-room extractor fan is in a crawl space, etc. This can’t be the right way to do things can it?</p>
<p>When I compare this to the way IT operations used to be compared to the way dev-ops is now I think it is fair to say that we are just at the start and that things must change. It used to be normal that an IT person would have to physically sit at a computer for hour on end to install OSes, applications and security. Now it is done remotely and automatically on predominantly virtualized hardware. Furthermore, most apps are now in the cloud and the management of the servers that run them are automated to the Nth degree. Home automation and IoT have a long way to go!</p>
<h2>Reason 2: Z-Wave Healing After Adding a Module</h2>
<p>As mentioned a common challenge with Z-Wave is that introducing a new module to the network requires the module and hub to be close together. This actually creates a lot of work. There are two main ways to handle this:</p>
<ol>
<li>bring the hub to the module once it is in-situ and operating</li>
<li>power the module up when it is close to the hub and then move it later</li>
</ol>
<p>Both options are problematic if you are relying on the mesh network capabilities to extend the range of the network because the mesh works by finding routes from one module to another so that it can communicate at distance.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>I don't expect to have an ARM-based PC any time soon</h2>

	<p><small>November 15, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>The ARM-related news of the time interval is of course that Apple
has announced several ARM-based Mac laptops and that early (and
preliminary) leaks are that they perform very well and are definitely
competitive. This raises the great hope in many technical people's
minds of ARM based laptops and desktops from more than Apple, ARM
PCs that would run more than Apple's OS X. This is especially a
dream for many Unix people, who already run little or no commercial
binary software and so in theory ARM support is only a recompile
away; moving away from the x86 hegemony would please a lot of people.</p>

<p>(The practice of moving to ARM is somewhat different, especially
for performance sensitive code. Focused use of x86 assembly is
surprisingly common in various places.)</p>

<p>My own view is that while I wouldn't mind using a competitive ARM
based PC (either laptop or desktop), I don't expect to actually
have one any time soon. The rub is that 'competitive'. Right now,
the only ARM chip maker that can compete with the performance of
the x86 hegemony in the desktop/laptop space is Apple, and Apple's
machines only run OS X. While there are promising developments in
the server space, many of them are also bespoke to the large cloud
vendors, and also may not be particularly suitable for scaling down
to desktops and laptops (in all sorts of dimensions, including how
much money can be made on them).</p>

<p>Apple has demonstrated that it's possible to make ARM be competitive
(on laptops, at least, although likely on desktops too), but <a href="https://twitter.com/thatcks/status/1326317293849153540">they
stand alone</a>
and I don't think it's likely for anyone else to join them. Apple has
the benefit of a gigantic market for their own ARM designs that
feeds a firehose of money into their R&amp;D budget and also good
assurance of large production runs even for laptop CPUs (never mind
phone ones). Anyone else would be in the position of trying to take
laptop and desktop CPU market share from Intel and AMD (who are
already fighting each other), without the kind of money firehose
and good market that Apple has.</p>

<p>(Apple also has the benefit of capturing all of the profit from its
laptops. An ARM CPU maker would capture much less of the profit of
machines with its CPUs in them; much of the overall profit would go
to the system vendors or at least to the makers of other parts, like
motherboards.)</p>

<p>The other problem is that merely being competitive isn't good enough,
because there are real costs to switching to ARM (even for Unix
people). It's likely that an ARM PC would need to be clearly better
than the x86 equivalent before very many people became interested,
and might face an extended period of doubt and proving itself. To
be honest, that would be my attitude toward the first generation
of ARM PCs; I would not buy immediately and let other people get
those experiences.</p>

<p>(I think this will be easier on laptops than on desktops, because
on laptops power efficiency can count for a lot. The longer battery
lifetime is already one of Apple's selling points for their new ARM
laptops)</p>

<p>PS: I would love to be wrong on this, as I'm not particularly fond
of the x86 hegemony. But I'm also a pragmatist.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>You’re happily working your way through a codebase when you happen upon some code that makes you stop and think: What the…!? Maybe it’s a method that’s doing something surprising. Or perhaps it’s doing something completely unsurprising, it’s just doing it in a surprising way.</p>

<p><img src="https://tekin.co.uk/images/20201113/math-lady.jpg" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="git-blame-to-the-rescue">Git blame to the rescue?</h2>

<p>When this happens you might instinctively reach for <code>git blame</code> to help you figure out what’s going on. After all, <code>git blame</code> gives you the commit that most recently touched the line, and often that’s enough to point you in the right direction. But often it isn’t and you’re none the wiser. That’s because:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>git blame is too coarse</strong>: it reports against the whole line. If the most recent change isn’t related to the part of the line you’re interested, you’re out of luck.</li>
  <li><strong>git blame is too shallow</strong>: it only reports a single change; the most recent one. The story of the particular piece of code you’re interested in may have evolved over several commits.</li>
  <li><strong>git blame is too narrow</strong>: it only considers the file you are running blame against. The code you are interested in may also appear in other files, but to get the relevant commits on those you’ll need to run blame several times.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you only use <code>git blame</code> you’re limiting yourself to a one-dimensional perspective of the code you’re trying to understand. Wouldn’t it be better to view things in 3D!?</p>

<h2 id="a-more-powerful-way-to-trace-the-history-of-wtf-code">A more powerful way to trace the history of WTF code</h2>

<p>Thankfully Git has some pretty powerful search tools built right in. Let’s take a closer look at some of the tools at our disposal.</p>

<h2 id="find-all-commits-containing-a-particular-piece-code">Find all commits containing a particular piece code</h2>

<p>If <code>git blame</code> is entry-level history search, <code>git log -S</code> (also known as “the pickaxe”) is how you take things to the next level. It lets you search for all commits that contain a given string:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git log <span>-S</span> <span>"method_name"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will return all the commits that contain <code>method_name</code> across the entire repository, giving you a bespoke history of a piece of code across both multiple commits and files. You can use the pickaxe to examine the entire history of a particular snippet: all the places it’s been used; how it’s usage has changed; if it’s moved file; when it was first introduced, and more.</p>

<h2 id="see-the-diffs-alongside-the-commit-messages">See the diffs alongside the commit messages</h2>

<p>If you include the <code>-p</code> option (short for <code>--patch</code>) you get the full diff alongside the commit messages, giving you even more context and making it easier to spot the relevant changes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log -S "method_name" -p
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="find-the-commit-that-first-added-some-code">Find the commit that first added some code</h2>

<p>Say you want to find the first commit that introduced a particular class, method or snippet of code. You can use the pickaxe combined with the <code>--reverse</code> option to get the commits in reverse-chronological order so the commit where the code first appears is listed at the top:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log -S "method_name" -p --reverse
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="find-when-a-piece-of-code-was-deleted">Find when a piece of code was deleted</h2>

<p>Because the pickaxe search finds both additions and deletions, you can even use it to find code that has since been deleted:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log -S "deleted code" -p
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Assuming the snippet no longer exists in the codebase the first commit returned will be the one where it was removed.</p>

<h2 id="limit-the-scope-of-the-search">Limit the scope of the search</h2>

<p>Because we’re using <code>git log</code> you can also provide a path to focus the search to a given file or folder:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log -S "some code" -p app/models/user.rb
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="search-deeper-with-a-regular-expression">Search deeper with a regular expression</h2>

<p>I mostly stick to the pickaxe because I find working with regular expressions cumbersome, but if you want to perform a more advanced search using a regular expression you can do so with <code>-G</code> instead:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log -G "REGEX HERE"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s also worth noting that searching with <code>-S</code> has a subtle limitation that <code>-G</code> does not: <code>-S</code> only shows commits that either added or removed the search string. If the string you are searching for moved within the same file but was otherwise unchanged, <code>-S</code> won’t include that commit, whereas <code>-G</code> will.</p>

<h2 id="search-the-commit-messages-themselves">Search the commit messages themselves</h2>

<p>Sometimes searching for literal code is too narrow, or the information you’re after isn’t actually in the code but in the commit messages themselves. In which case you can use <code>--grep</code> to search commit messages instead:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log --grep "commit message search"
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="in-summary">In summary</h2>

<p>Next time some code has you puzzled and you want to understand more about it, look beyond <code>git blame</code> and dig deeper into the history using the pickaxe and friends:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Find the entire history of a snippet of code with <code>git log -S</code></li>
  <li>Include <code>-p</code> to see the diff as well as the commit messages</li>
  <li>Include <code>--reverse</code> to see the commit that introduced the code listed first</li>
  <li>Scope search to specific folders or files by including a path</li>
  <li>Search with a regular expression using <code>git log -G</code></li>
  <li>Search commit messages using <code>git log --grep</code></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>

<p>Of course searching a codebase’s history will only be fruitful if the history itself is helpful. If the history hasn’t been constructed with atomic commits that have useful commit messages, searching it will likely be a frustrating and unhelpful experience.</p>

										                <p><em>A superresolution image of a group of killer T-cells (green and red) surrounding a cancer cell (blue, centre). Image: US NIH.</em></p>
<p>On World Cancer Day this year, Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai, known in India for its cancer care facilities, <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/exploring-new-options-in-cancer-care/article30729911.ece">announced</a> that it would study the <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02161900">effects of yoga</a> on breast cancer patients. While the association between <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/features/regular-exercise-helps-patients-combat-cancer-67317">exercise and recovery</a> in cancer patients has been known since the 1990s, we know little about how this works on a molecular level.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59996">new study</a> shows that the key might lie in activating certain immune cells. The study, conducted by Randall Johnson and his team from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, and the University of Cambridge, was the culmination of three years of research on what makes exercise good for cancer patients.</p>


<p>They first established that exercise could indeed decrease the growth of tumours. They induced tumours in mice, mimicking breast cancer in humans, and separated them into two groups: one exercised on running wheels and one did not. After a few days, the tumours had shrunk in the group that exercised but not in the sedentary group.</p>
<p>When the researchers examined blood samples from the mice, two things had dramatically increased after exercise: immune cells known as CD8+ T-cells and a compound called lactic acid.</p>
<p>The team first looked into CD8+ T-cells, which <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-analysis/the-ever-expanding-t-cell-world-a-primer-31123">defend against</a> tumours and infections. Did increased levels after exercise mean that the cells were involved in reducing tumour growth? To test this, the team removed CD8+ T-cells from tumour-bearing mice and then made them exercise. This time, exercising could not shrink the tumours: removing the T-cells also removed the positive effects of exercise.</p>
<p>“Then we did what, to my mind, is the coolest experiment in the paper,” said Johnson. They made mice exercise, carefully took CD8+ T-cells from them, and transplanted the cells into another set of mice that had tumours but didn’t exercise. To the scientists’ delight, simply transplanting CD8+ T-cells from mice that had exercised could shrink tumours in sedentary mice.</p>
<p>“The T-cells themselves are coming in ‘trained,’ making them better anti-tumour T-cells,” Johnson said.</p>
<p>What was ‘training’ the T-cells, though? That’s when the team turned their attention to lactic acid. After an intense bout of exercise, lactic acid is what makes your muscles feel like they’re burning. In the bloodstream, it circulates as lactate, its ionic form.</p>
<p>To mimic this form and the levels attained after exercise, the researchers injected sodium lactate into sedentary mice that had tumours. As with the T-cells, they found that daily injections of sodium lactate could shrink tumours and improve survival in these mice.</p>
<p>The team now knew that, through exercise, both lactate and CD8+ T-cells could reduce tumour growth. But this still didn’t explain how the two effects were linked.</p>
<p>To answer this, the scientists first checked whether lactate could independently activate CD8+ T-cells – and found that it could. Next, they again injected mice with lactate, only this time they removed the CD8+ T-cells from the mice. Without the T-cells, lactate injections could no longer lessen tumour growth.</p>
<p>“This shows that it’s really the lactate affecting the T-cells and helping them achieve a better anti-tumour effect,” Johnson said.</p>
<p><ins>Also read: <a href="https://science.thewire.in/health/why-everyone-around-you-seems-to-be-getting-cancer/">Why Everyone Around You Seems to Be Getting Cancer</a></ins></p>
<p>The study fills an important gap in our understanding of how exercise and the related metabolite changes boost anti-tumour the activities of our immune cells.</p>
<p>This said, “My main concern is that people should not think that only exercise can cure cancer,” S.V. Chiplunkar, a former director of the Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer, Mumbai, and current head of its Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy division, cautioned.</p>
<p>“A combination of immunotherapy with supervised exercise or yoga regimens may yield significant benefits, but this needs to be tested in a randomised clinical trial.” Chiplunkar wasn’t involved in the study.</p>
<p>And as with any good study, this one spawned more questions than it answered. “Future studies should address how lactate levels are modulated in cancer patients/mice models in response [to] exercise,” Rajender Motiani, an assistant professor and DBT/Wellcome Trust India fellow at the Regional Centre for Biotechnology, Faridabad, said.</p>
<p>“A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0485-4">recent study</a> in elite athletes showed that lactate is utilised by a unique class of gut microbiome, enhancing endurance and performance. It would be worth examining gut microbiota changes in cancer patients in response to exercise.”</p>
<p>Johnson’s team is now working out how much exercise is needed to boost T-cell activity. For example, one question they’re asking is if one hour of intense exercise could be better than two hours of light exercise.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Helene Rundqvist, the study’s lead author, has been involved in a <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02522260?term=exercise&amp;cond=Breast+Cancer&amp;cntry=SE&amp;city=Stockholm&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1">clinical trial</a> assessing the effects of exercise on breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The trial is still active and expected to be completed in 2022.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Django framework for building python server applications has been around since forever and I believe that the reason for this is the speed at which you can develop apps without compromising on robustness.<br></p><p>To gauge the usefulness of any backend framework, a great litmus test is to see how easy it is to plug in a database to your application and expose the database models to the client via 4 operations - Create, Read, Update and Delete.<br></p><p>This functionality solves a big chunk of your problems, especially if you are building a product that is more front-end heavy and you want to spend as little bandwidth as possible on building your APIs.<br></p><h3><strong>What is CRUD?</strong><br></h3><p>An application server is nothing but a layer on top of a database which provides the ability for a client application to perform the following underlying operations.<br></p><ol role="list"><li>Create a new entry into a table in the database.</li><li>Read the database table entries either by fetching a list of all entries or retrieving the details of a single entry.</li><li>Update an existing entry in the database either by changing certain details or by replacing it entirely with a new one.</li><li>Delete a database table entry either by removing it from the database or by simply marking it as deleted and deactivating it.<br></li></ol><p>Django has ways of doing all of this right out of the box, but I prefer to use a framework written on top of Django called the <a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/" target="_blank">Django Rest Framework</a> which makes things even simpler by providing an intuitive interface to the developers. <br></p><h3><strong>A sample CRUD application</strong><br></h3><div><p>I write all my blog posts on the apple notes app before I edit and publish them and it occurred to me that a note taking app is a great way to <a href="https://github.com/sankalpjonn/django-crud-example" target="_blank">demonstrate a CRUD application</a>. </p></div><figure id="w-node-bc04fc2d279c-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5faf5796ca5e3a5dd77c5b41_XEHsDH39C2XuP7jH2D_R7hv6wYs8ZGIBkCij0NWiAXStAOuzeIqG61JLp52DNELlsmxqfuMj33tIE-0YsgTIIIDeskVcpRMarPKJKsNA4O2rBoMIFmgahW8Vo2J0YCLZqBsym1Mb.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>A note taking app that we will build using Django and Django Rest Framework</figcaption></figure><p>To build an application like this, we need a database table that stores a list of notes consisting of a Title, Content and the last updated timestamp. The notes are sorted according to the last updated timestamp.</p><p>To build this application we need the following functions:&nbsp;</p><ol start="1" role="list"><li>Creating a new note with an empty title and content.</li><li>Updating the newly created note with a title and content.</li><li>Reading the fields of a note.</li><li>Partially updating the note by modifying either tile or content.</li><li>Listing all the notes in the database sorted by last updated timestamp.</li><li>Deleting a note by marking it as deactivated.</li></ol><p>I&nbsp;will be going through all the steps involved in creating this application, but first let's start with the basics.</p><h3>Setting up a Django project</h3><p>There is some basic boilerplate code involved in building any Django application. Here is a summary of all the steps needed to set up the boilerplate<br>‍</p><p><em>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/07b99adf85538b5a90a0dcaa34de328c.js&lt;/p&gt;</em></p><h5><strong>Need for a virtual environment</strong></h5><p>While building any python applications, it is recommended to create a virtual environment and install all the packages you need within this environment to keep them isolated from the rest of your machine. This not only ensures prevention of conflicts but also makes it easy to deploy this application anywhere you want.</p><p>Once this virtual environment is activated, your development environment is setup.</p><h5><strong>Creating a Django project</strong></h5><p>Once the virtual environment is created and the necessary python packages are installed, the boilerplate code you need can be created by using a nifty tool called django-admin. We will use this to create a project called <em>notesapp</em>. This not only creates the project structure but also configures a default SQLite database that you can use for the application. </p><p>This database is nothing but a single file created locally with the name <em>db.sqlite3</em> and is very handy to quickly prototype your application. You can change the database settings inside <em>settings.py</em> to point it to any database. This can be done later too once the basic functionality of your application is ready and works with SQLIte.</p><p>After your Django project is created, you also have to create a new Django app which we will use to define our models and APIs. Let's call this <em>notes. </em>Make sure to add this to the INSTALLED_APPS section of your settings.py</p><h3>Creating database models</h3><p>Before writing the CRUD&nbsp;APIs, we must first create a database model on which we wish to perform the CRUD&nbsp;operations. Let us create a model called <em>Note </em>in notes/models.py.</p><p>‍</p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/d5e29080d973326be371f0d03a5d23ef.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>‍</p><p>Before we proceed we must update the schema because a new database table needs to be created in the underlying database. This can be done by creating and running migrations</p><p>‍</p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE: https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/8234bd9ad41637718be8dca4dba04235.js&lt;/p&gt;<br>‍</p><h3>Creating the CRUD&nbsp;APIs</h3><p>Now that the model has been created, we need a way to perform CRUD operations on this model by writing as little code as possible. This is where Django Rest Framework comes in. Not only can you expose CRUD&nbsp;APIs on this model within minutes, but you also get a pretty nifty user interface to view those APIs in action. </p><p>To do this, you must first define a serializer for the database model you created in the above step. <strong>‍</strong></p><h5><strong>Defining a serializer</strong></h5><p>A serializer is responsible for two things<br></p><ol start="1" role="list"><li>To validate an incoming create/update request and reject it if the fields are not in the format that is required to create/update an entry in the database table.</li><li>To convert a database table entry into a format like JSON&nbsp;that can be transferred over the internet to the client.</li></ol><p>Let us create a serializer in notes/serializers.py as follows.</p><p>‍</p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/4d69bb0c0de94789842fe9eb23e8e882.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>‍</p><p>Inside the Meta class, we define which database model is being serialized and what all fields within that model should be serialized. We could choose to include only certain fields from the model that we would like to expose over the API.</p><p>We can also define certain fields as <em>read_only</em> which indicates that these fields will be ignored if present in a create/update request but they will be present in the response a read request. </p><p>In this above case, is_active is responsible for indicating if a note has been deleted or not. Therefore we must not allow it to be modified via a create/update request and it should be set to false only when a delete operation is performed. This will become more clear in the upcoming steps. </p><p>We can also define fields as <em>write_only </em>which will indicate that these fields will not be present in a read response but we will allow the field to be modified in a create/update request. We can now proceed to writing the CRUD&nbsp;APIs</p><h5><strong>Defining an API&nbsp;View set</strong></h5><p>In Django, the APIs are written in views.py and each API&nbsp;that does some operation on a certain database resource is a view. In our case we will be performing multiple operations on the database model and hence what we need is a viewset. Here is how you define one in notes/views.py</p><p>‍</p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/b313384c0774ec4f1dee342ced8ccc20.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>‍<br>‍<br>This viewset is now capable of performing all the CRUD&nbsp;operations and it will use the NoteSerializer to determine how the data will be received and how it will be sent back to the requesting client. <br></p><p>Since a read operation could be retrieving a single note or listing all the existing notes, we need a way to handle both cases. </p><p>The <em>get_object </em>is responsible to determine how an object is retrieved. In this case we look for an <em>id </em>field in the query parameters of a a request and use that to retrieve a note. </p><p>This method is also used while making an update operation because to update a particular note we would have to first retrieve that note.</p><p>The <em>get_queryset</em> method is responsible for determining how a list operation will work. In this case we will be listing all the notes which are still active and sort them in the decreasing order of the <em>last_udpated_on</em> timestamp.</p><p>The <em>perform_delete</em> method will determine what to do when a delete operation is requested. In this case we do not want to delete the row from the database and we simply want to deactivate it. Therefore we will be setting the <em>is_active</em> field to False and saving the note.</p><h5>‍<strong>Defining the URL&nbsp;path</strong>‍</h5><p>We just have one more step to complete before we can see our APIs in action and that is to determine what URL&nbsp;path will invoke the above viewset. This can be done in notesapp/urls.py as follows.<br>‍</p><p>‍<br>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/902b7c23e95e3cb4ddf99f1b52bbbe52.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><div><p>‍</p><p>To explain what is going on here, we are basically saying that if the url <em>/note</em> is called, no matter what the HTTP&nbsp;method is, we will be invoking the NoteViewSet and based on what the HTTP method is we will call a particular method within this viewset.<strong>‍</strong></p></div><ol start="1" role="list"><li>A POST&nbsp;call will result in a create operation of the Note model.</li><li>A GET&nbsp;call will result in retrieving a single Note model object using the <em>id</em> query parameter.</li><li>A&nbsp;PUT&nbsp;call will result in replacing an existing Note model with a new Note and the existing Note model will be fetched using the <em>id</em> query parameter.</li><li>A PATCH&nbsp;call will result in modifying only a certain field inside an existing Note model instead of entirely replacing it and the existing Note model will be fetched using the <em>id</em> query parameter.</li><li>A DELETE&nbsp;call will result in calling a destroy function which internally calls the <em>perform_destroy</em> method defined above in views.py.</li></ol><p>In case you haven't noticed, there is one thing missing in this url PATH and that is the ability to list all the existing Note model objects. </p><p>To solve this I&nbsp;created another URL&nbsp;path <em>/note/all </em>where I am invoking the same viewset as the above one with the difference being the GET&nbsp;call will now invoke a list method on the viewset instead of a retrieve method which means that the <em>get_queryset </em>method defined earlier will be invoked.<br></p><h3>See your APIs in action<br></h3><p>Okay enough talk, let us now run the server and view the APIs in action. You can run the Django development server using the below command and it will expose your server on the 8000 port on localhost.</p><div><p>‍</p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/473d335affb3426f7d5cbc1a747e4fe4.js&lt;/p&gt;</p></div><blockquote>Please do not forget to include <em>r…</em></blockquote></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-4608430843265935994">
<p>I am what I would call a non-famous public person. What do I mean by that? I mean that I have jobs where people publicly review my work. As a college instructor, I receive student reviews. Some of them get read internally at our school, and some of them get posted publicy. And they’re attached to my name. They’re not some product where people might just know my company or my brand. They know <em>me</em>, and they’re reviewing <em>me</em>. As an author, my books get reviewed. Some of those reviews are by editors and official reviewers internal to the publisher. Some of those reviews are by email. But most of those reviews are posted online. As a software developer and hobbyist podcaster I also get public reviews.</p>

<p>To anyone in a personalized creative field who cares deeply about their work, bad reviews hurt. It’s not just about being sensitive (although I am sensitive and that doesn’t help). It’s that when you really pour your heart into something, as I do my teaching for example, then the product is an extension of you. Nobody would deny that the way a class or a book turns out is an extension of the personality, knowledge, and ability of the teacher/author. And when the product is criticized, it’s like you are being criticized. </p>

<p>My dad, who was also a college instructor, and the producer of nine books and nine instructional videos among many other public creative ventures, had a very thin skin. He couldn’t stand me reading him a bad review. That stuck with me. This very accomplished man, couldn’t stand even a little criticism. When I get too sensitive, I try to remember how his inability to accept criticism hurt some of his products. He was much more about getting things done than doing them perfectly. If he had a little bit more of a perfectionist streak in him, he would have done even better. But maybe he would have done less…</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter if I receive eighteen great reviews for a class. It’s the words of the two bad reviews that stick with me. And do you know why? <em>Because almost always there’s a kernel of truth to those reviews.</em> Does that mean we should listen to them? Well if I only listened to the bad reviews, I would never produce anything. I would just stay in bed. The fact is the people who are getting no bad reviews, are the people who are not taking the risk of putting themselves out there. So, we have to not let ourselves get so discouraged that we stop producing. And we have to remember that while we may not have served those two students well, we may have served those other eighteen students better than they would have been served in a world without us teaching them. </p>

<p>We can’t please every student or every customer. Nothing that gets watched/read by more than a few people is going to be liked by all of them. Even Mother Theresa would get a downvote on YouTube. So, if we’re serving the majority, we don’t want to let the critiques of a few steer us in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>On the other hand, being like my dad is dangerous too. <strong>No, the customer is not always right. But usually the customer has a point. We have to always be working to get better.</strong> Because we’re not perfect, and there’s always room for improvement. <strong>And we need to read those bad reviews to find those spaces for improvement.</strong> It doesn’t mean they’re right, but it does mean we need to think about them.</p>

<p>My dad accomplished an amazing amount. If he let those bad reviews slow him down too much, it’s very possible he would have not accomplished as much. But if he could have found a few tweaks, a few changes, to serve a few customers better, well then he could have grown through them. I want to grow, but I also don’t want to stop. So, I can’t let the reviews get me too down, but I have to read them.</p>

<p><strong>In this article, let’s learn to compute VMAF, PSNR, and SSIM using FFmpeg. While working on videos (compression or post-processing), it is common to compute objective metrics in addition to doing subjective Visual Quality testing. If you are using FFmpeg in your workflow, it is very easy to compute these metrics instead of purchasing expensive tools. </strong></p>



<p>Let’s go ahead and take a look at these metrics and how they are computed, shall we?</p>



<hr>



<h2>What is VMAF?</h2>



<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VMAF from Netflix</a></strong>&nbsp;stands for Video Multi-method Assessment Fusion, and it is a video quality metric that combines human vision modeling with machine learning. It’s become very popular as it succeeds (not fully) at automating subjective quality testing that usually requires humans to watch and score videos.</p>



<p>FFmpeg and Netflix’s VMAF are now part of every video processing and compression engineer’s toolbox. To understand how to install VMAF, please read our “<a href="https://ottverse.com/vmaf-ffmpeg-ubuntu-compilation-installation-usage-guide/">VMAF Installation</a>” article.</p>



<hr>



<h2>How to Compute VMAF using FFmpeg</h2>



<p>Let’s look at a couple of ways of computing VMAF. </p>



<p><strong>If your source and destination videos are of the same dimensions (height and width)</strong>, then you can directly compute the VMAF value using the command line below. </p>



<p>All you need to do is point FFmpeg to the location of the VMAF model file and it will do the rest. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i videoToCompare.mp4 -i originalVideo.mp4 -lavfi libvmaf="model_path=vmaf_v0.6.1.pkl":log_path=vmaf_logfile.txt -f null -</code></pre>



<p><strong>However, in case the source and destination videos are not of the same resolution, then you have to ensure that the destination is brought to the same resolution as the source video before computing VMAF</strong>.</p>



<p>Here is a simple one-liner that uses the <code>filter_complex</code> to do the resolution change and then computes the VMAF value. I have used the <code>bicubic</code> filter to do the up/down scaling. </p>



<pre><code><code>bin/ffmpeg -i test_720p30.mp4 -i test_1080p30.mp4 -filter_complex "[0:v]scale=1920x1080:flags=bicubic[main]; [1:v]scale=1920x1080:flags=bicubic,format=pix_fmts=yuv420p,fps=fps=30/1[ref]; \</code>
<code>[main][ref]libvmaf=psnr=true:log_path=vmaflog.json:log_fmt=json" \</code>
<code>-f null -</code></code></pre>



<p>The log file that is produced by the VMAF computation is very comprehensive. It provides a frame-wise score of VMAF and its constituent metrics, along with the aggregate score (if that’s all you are looking for). </p>



<p>Here is an example of the VMAF file. </p>

<h2>What is PSNR and How Is It Calculated?</h2>



<p>From Wikipedia, </p>



<p><em><strong>Peak signal-to-noise ratio, often abbreviated&nbsp;PSNR, is an engineering term for the ratio between the maximum possible power of a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(information_theory)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signal</a>&nbsp;and the power of corrupting&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noise</a>&nbsp;that affects the fidelity of its representation.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>



<p>So, for a video, you are essentially trying to compute how much noise or pixel corruption has been introduced due to the video compression process which is essentially lossy (mainly due to Quantization). </p>



<p>The first step is to compute the Mean Squared Error or MSE. The formula is shown below where I and K represent the original and destination images respectively and <code>m</code> and <code>n</code> are the height and width of the images respectively. </p>



<p><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3a34719b4f391dba26b3e8e4460b7595d62eece4" alt="{\mathit  {MSE}}={\frac  {1}{m\,n}}\sum _{{i=0}}^{{m-1}}\sum _{{j=0}}^{{n-1}}[I(i,j)-K(i,j)]^{2}"></p>



<p>Once you have the MSE, you can compute the PSNR using the formula shown below. </p>



<p><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fc22801ed1232ff1231c4156b589de5c32063a8a" alt="{\begin{aligned}{\mathit  {PSNR}}&amp;=10\cdot \log _{{10}}\left({\frac  {{\mathit  {MAX}}_{I}^{2}}{{\mathit  {MSE}}}}\right)\\&amp;=20\cdot \log _{{10}}\left({\frac  {{\mathit  {MAX}}_{I}}{{\sqrt  {{\mathit  {MSE}}}}}}\right)\\&amp;=20\cdot \log _{{10}}\left({{\mathit  {MAX}}_{I}}\right)-10\cdot \log _{{10}}\left({{{\mathit  {MSE}}}}\right)\end{aligned}}"></p>



<p>Here,&nbsp;<em>MAX<sub>I</sub></em>&nbsp;is the maximum possible pixel value of the image. When the pixels are represented using 8 bits per sample, this is 255. </p>



<h2>How to Calculate PSNR using FFmpeg?</h2>



<p>You don’t have to go through all those calculations while using FFmpeg. All you need to do use the filter module <code>lavfi</code> and tell it to compute the PSNR. That’s it. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i videoToCompare.mp4 -i originalVideo.mp4 -lavfi psnr=stats_file=psnr_logfile.txt -f null -</code></pre>



<p>FFmpeg will print the average PSNR on the console while the log file will contain a frame-wise list of the MSE and the PSNR for the Luma and Chroma planes (y, u, and v). An example is shown below – </p>



<pre><code>n:1 mse_avg:54.96 mse_y:72.51 mse_u:27.98 mse_v:11.74 psnr_avg:30.73 psnr_y:29.53 psnr_u:33.66 psnr_v:37.43 
 n:2 mse_avg:69.70 mse_y:93.80 mse_u:31.01 mse_v:12.02 psnr_avg:29.70 psnr_y:28.41 psnr_u:33.22 psnr_v:37.33 
 n:3 mse_avg:72.74 mse_y:98.37 mse_u:31.02 mse_v:11.96 psnr_avg:29.51 psnr_y:28.20 psnr_u:33.21 psnr_v:37.35 
 n:4 mse_avg:73.11 mse_y:98.94 mse_u:31.14 mse_v:11.76 psnr_avg:29.49 psnr_y:28.18 psnr_u:33.20 psnr_v:37.43 </code></pre>

<h2>How to Calculate SSIM using FFmpeg?</h2>



<p>Finally, let’s take a look at computing SSIM using FFmpeg. Again looking at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">definition of SSIM</a>, </p>



<p><em><strong>The&nbsp;structural similarity&nbsp;index measure&nbsp;(SSIM) is a method for predicting the perceived quality of digital television and cinematic pictures, as well as other kinds of digital images and videos. SSIM is used for measuring the similarity between two images. The SSIM index is a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_quality#Classification_of_objective_video_quality_metrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full reference metric</a>; in other words, the measurement or prediction of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_quality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">image quality</a>&nbsp;is based on an initial uncompressed or distortion-free image as reference.</strong></em></p>



<p>Calculating SSIM using FFmpeg is very similar to calcuating PSNR. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i videoToCompare.mp4 -i originalVideo.mp4 -lavfi ssim=stats_file=ssim_logfile.txt -f null -</code></pre>



<p>The output of this command is going to look like this – </p>



<pre><code>[Parsed_ssim_0 @ 0000029c82894300] SSIM Y:0.926845 (11.357537) U:0.876798 (9.093807) V:0.860658 (8.559193) All:0.907472 (10.337287)</code></pre>



<p>And the log file will give you information on the SSIM values for each of the planes (Y, U, and V) along with the aggregate for each of the frames of the video. </p>



<pre><code> n:1 Y:0.930033 U:0.926453 V:0.913508 All:0.926682 (11.347897)
 n:2 Y:0.919140 U:0.915343 V:0.910900 All:0.917134 (10.816226)
 n:3 Y:0.922417 U:0.915795 V:0.910959 All:0.919404 (10.936853)
 n:4 Y:0.920077 U:0.916443 V:0.912994 All:0.918291 (10.877300)
 n:5 Y:0.926438 U:0.927597 V:0.917905 All:0.925209 (11.261518)
 n:6 Y:0.920619 U:0.919988 V:0.918780 All:0.920207 (10.980375)</code></pre>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>That’s it folks – now you know how to calculate three very important objective metrics for video quality evaluation — PSNR, VMAF, and SSIM. By computing all three and using them for analysis, it’s hard to be thrown off by artifacts that one metric can catch and the other can’t. </p>



<p>And like always, do spend a few minutes doing some visual testing (subjective) after you’re done with the objective scores! </p>

<p>Do you hate writing? Me too.</p>



<div><p>I am not talking about tweets or IG posts. I’m talking about 500 word long articles and essays. Most of us don’t like writing them. They take too much time and effort. </p><p>But is time really the problem? I don’t think so. We spend a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.broadbandsearch.net/blog/average-daily-time-on-social-media" target="_blank">lot of time</a> on social media everyday right? Yeah time is not the problem.</p></div>



<p>So is effort the problem? Hmm let’s see. What happens when you open a blank page to write? Does anxiety kicks in? For me it does. </p>







<p>See, when I plan to write an article, usually I have a general idea about the topic I plan to write about. Though as soon as I open a blank page, my ideas start ruffling among each other making a mess. I don’t have clarity anymore. Everything starts falling apart, anxiety kicks in and …. I close the tab. Phew too much trouble for a few likes. </p>







<p>But after a few days / weeks those ideas start dying. The worst part is I see them dying without seeing the light of the day. That sucks. </p>



<p>And that’s why I try to write, and you should too.</p>



<p>Writing about a topic gives me a platform to just lay my ideas wide in the open. It’s like clearing my mental hard drive. It feels relaxing. </p>



<p>But If I just pour my random thoughts on a piece of paper that’s just writing, not <em>good</em> writing. I don’t want people to see a mishmash of ill shaped ideas, I want them to see a well ordered architecture where every part fits in. It’s not just for the sake of readers though, It’s for the ideas themselves. </p>



<p>Often about a topic, I have a range of musings. They’re like vectors, each with their own direction and magnitude. They make sense individually but to understand about the topic as a whole, all of them need to come in sync. Their rhythm has to match. That’s what good writing does. </p>



<blockquote><p>Good writing is just clear thinking expressed on paper.</p></blockquote>



<p>Writing about a topic makes me think about it from all the directions and perspectives. </p>



<p><em>What do I know about this topic?</em></p>



<p><em>Do I know enough?</em></p>



<p><em>If everything I know, correct?</em></p>



<p><em>How can I fill my gaps?</em></p>







<p>Jotting down everything I know helps me answer many of these questions. The ones still unanswered force me to research more. It’s a cycle.</p>



<p>Each draft of writing takes me one step closer to the complete and clear picture. The ultimate truth starts showing itself in the end. It’s a bliss moment.</p>



<p>The learning readers get is always a pleasant <em>byproduct</em>. </p>







<p>As one of my favorite writer <a href="https://twitter.com/Julian" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@Julian</a> says, </p>



<blockquote><p>The best writing is therapy that you publish for the world to learn from.</p></blockquote>







<p>After self-learning and expression, what is the next best thing writing offers?</p>



<p><strong>Relationships</strong>.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Writing online is a superpower.</p><p>Here’s a list of people who should start writing online.</p><p>1. The Niche Hobbyist</p><p>The Internet rewards people with obscure interests. Writing online will help you find other like-minded hobbyists who you wouldn’t be able to find in real-life.</p></div>— David Perell (@david_perell) <a href="https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1227612675334660099?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<div><p>Writing online helps you create meaningful relationships, sometimes even indirectly. When people read well written articles, they can’t stop but appreciate the coherent thinking of the writer. These artifacts demonstrate author’s expertise in the given topic and hence increase their visibility.</p><p>Internet is a great place, good content can reach thousands of people with zero marketing. </p></div>



<blockquote><p>“By making it easy for people to find you online, you’ll create a vehicle for serendipity.” – <a href="https://twitter.com/david_perell">@david_perell</a></p></blockquote>



<p>This visibility can get you job offers, network of influential people, money and many other things. </p>



<div><p>I can go on and on about the benefits of putting yourself out there but it’s a moo point. You have to experience the magic yourself. When a stranger thanks you for a piece of advice or a someone asks if they can use your work, it feels great. </p><p>Not trying to brag here but even as a crappy writer myself, I have experienced the joy of someone reaching out to me to thank me for my work. You should too!</p></div>

        <article>
          <section><p>Earlier this year I bought a Raspberry Pi 3 to have as an AArch64
development machine. The fastest way to get familiar with an
instruction set is to write a disassembler for it and I’ve made one
for 64-bit <span>ARM</span> in R6RS Scheme as part of
the <a href="https://github.com/weinholt/machine-code">machine-code</a> project.
The instruction set is called <span>ARM</span> A64, instructions are always 32 bits
wide and they have a neat structure which is pretty fast to decode in&nbsp;software.</p>

<p>The architecture has 31 integer registers (x0-x30). There is also a
stack pointer register and a zero register that always contains
zeroes. Both these registers are encoded as register number 31, and
it’s up to each instruction if an operand can use the stack pointer or
the zero register. The x30 register is used to store the return
address. These registers are all 64-bit registers and the lower 32
bits can be accessed using the names w0-w31. Operations that write to
the lower 32 bits also clear the upper 32 bits, just like on&nbsp;<span>AMD64</span>.</p>
<p>There are also 32 registers usable as either floating point registers
or 128-bit vector registers. As vectors they support different
arrangements that are either 64 or 128 bits in total, containing
8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit or 64-bit quantities. There are many
instructions that operate on multiple quantities at the same time,
which is an interesting way to speed up code. Multiple loop iterations
can be run&nbsp;simultaneously.</p>
<p>The instructions are documented in the <a href="https://developer.arm.com/docs/ddi0487/a/arm-architecture-reference-manual-armv8-for-armv8-a-architecture-profile"><span>ARM</span> ARM for ARMv8-A</a>. I’ve
counted, not including instruction aliases, 442 instruction mnemonics
(things like <span>ADD</span>, EOR, B.EQ, etc). They are organized in what is
basically a four-level table: main encoding, instruction group, decode
group and instruction. Chapter C4 of the manual follows the same
structure. This structure is nice for fast decoding, but it’s not
strictly necessary since all encodings at the instruction level still
need to have a unique&nbsp;meaning.</p>
<p>For each instruction mnemonic there can be multiple variants that
enable the instruction to handle different types of operands. An
example of this is the <span>FMUL</span> instruction that multiples two floating
point values. In a C program it would look like <code>a = b * c</code>. In A64
assembler it might look like one of these, depending on what the
surrounding code&nbsp;does:</p>
<pre><code><span>fmul</span> <span>s0</span>, <span>s1</span>, <span>s2</span>            
<span>fmul</span> <span>d0</span>, <span>d1</span>, <span>d2</span>            
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>2</span>s, <span>v1</span>.<span>2</span>s, <span>v2</span>.<span>2</span>s   
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>4</span>s, <span>v1</span>.<span>4</span>s, <span>v2</span>.<span>4</span>s   
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>2</span>d, <span>v1</span>.<span>2</span>d, <span>v2</span>.<span>2</span>d   
<span>fmul</span> <span>s0</span>, <span>s1</span>, <span>v2</span>.s[<span>0</span>]       
<span>fmul</span> <span>d0</span>, <span>d1</span>, <span>v2</span>.d[<span>0</span>]
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>2</span>s, <span>v1</span>.<span>2</span>s, <span>v2</span>.s[<span>0</span>] 
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>4</span>s, <span>v1</span>.<span>4</span>s, <span>v2</span>.s[<span>0</span>]
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>2</span>d, <span>v1</span>.<span>2</span>d, <span>v2</span>.d[<span>0</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>That’s quite a few variants for a single mnemonic. Not all mnemonics
have this many variants, but depending on how one counts I estimate
that there are in total around 1000-2000 variants. The instruction set
designers had to fit all these variants into 32 bits, while at the
same time making space for instructions that encode relatively large
immediate operands, and not forgetting about leaving space for future
extensions. As if that wasn’t difficult enough, the instructions
should also be easy to decode with&nbsp;hardware.</p>

<p>I’ve extracted the tables from my disassembler, rendered them with
the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/bit-field">bit-field package</a>, and
made them slightly interactive. If you’re reading this in a browser
you can see the encodings below. The thing to notice is that each
layer adds extra fixed bits: fields that must be a fixed 0 or 1 value.
(The last level, the instruction level, is not shown in this table).
Two encodings under the same parent always have some differences in
these fields, so that they can be separated by an instruction decoder.
Click an encoding to expand the next level of&nbsp;encodings.</p>




<p>There are many conventions in the field names. Instructions that take
register operands encode them in fields named <em>Rd</em>, <em>Rn</em> and <em>Rm</em>.
Immediate values (integers, <span>PC</span>-relative offsets, etc) are named <em>imm</em>.
Fields that change the type of operation tend to be called <em>op</em>N or
<em>opcode</em>. In general a few of the fields encode the operation (or the
size of the operation) and the rest encode the&nbsp;operands.</p>

<p>The image below shows the encoding space of the instruction set. The
<em>x</em> axis goes from 0 to 2<sup>16</sup>-1 and encodes the lower 16 bits
of the instruction space, and the <em>y</em> axis contains the upper 16 bits.
The different colors denote different decode groups, i.e. all the
encodings at the third level of the table above. (There is probably a
better&nbsp;representation).</p>
<p><img src="https://weinholt.se/articles/arm-a64-instruction-set/a64-2048-crushed.png" title="Encoding space used by ARM A64" alt="An image showing the 32-bit
  encoding space. Mostly there are horizontal thick lines of different
  colors. This shows that the higher 16 bits tend to keep similar
  instructions together, although there is some mirroring around the
  middle of the image."></p>
<p>All the dark spots are places where ARMv8 does not have any allocated
instructions, or the encoding is reserved. For many instructions there
are some fields that have reserved encodings and these are also&nbsp;dark.</p>
<p>Even if instructions are kept to the fixed 32 bit encoding there is
still plenty of room for the instruction set to&nbsp;grow.</p>

<p><span>ARM</span> A64 is a quite clean instruction set with only a few quirks here
and there in its encoding. Compared to AMD64 it has twice the amount
of registers, a clean separation of load/store instructions, clean
RISCy operands (mostly one destination register and two source
registers) and of course the register names and most mnemonics are
totally different. Both have 128-bit vector registers and 64-bit
integer registers and a 64-bit address space. They look quite similar,
except everything’s&nbsp;different.</p>

<p>The why of why people use vim has been <a href="https://dev.to/iggredible/why-i-use-vim-2f40">covered fairly extensively</a>, so I thought I would spend a little time explaining why I <em>teach</em> vim to my high school students, even in 2020.</p>



<p>It all began when I was assigned a mixed class of ninth through twelfth grade students in computer science just after the financial collapse on 2008. Well, the financial collapse first brought me to teach Intro to Programming using VB 6.0 and Windows thin clients, which was an experience unto itself (thanks in part to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conficker">Conficker virus</a>). That experience is worth a separate blog post and is a good part of why one of my specialties is teaching computer security.</p>



<p>So here I am with all levels of student, including AP CS A (read: AP CS Java), and obsolete Windows PCs (at least the thin clients were gone). I couldn’t install any software, wanted to teach C, had to teach Java, and had very few options (these were the days before online web based IDEs).</p>



<p>I had experience with the UNIX command line, primarily Sun Workstations, thanks to my wonderful education at <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/departments/computer-science-and-engineering">UCSC</a>, so that wasn’t an issue. I had played with Linux in the 1990s to a bit of success, but hadn’t touched it for almost a decade. So I found an old Pentium 2 carcass in the the garbage outside my condo complex, installed a hard drive, and tried this new (to me) flavor of Linux called, strangely, <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>.</p>



<p>I quickly realized this machine could have all the students coding at one, discovered the wonder that is <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html">putty.exe</a> (it doesn’t require any installation to run!) to connect the obsolete PCs to the server and soon my students were off and coding.</p>



<p>Why did I teach them vim? I wish I could say I agonized over all the options at the time and decided vim was the best pedagogical solution, but the reality of the situation was that vi was what I used in college because my father taught me vi. You see, I am lucky to have a father who worked in the industry and is even somewhat of a <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/qed.html">footnote in text editor history</a>. So I taught vi (later vim) because it is what I knew. A running theme in many computer science teacher’s trials by fire… teaching something because it is what they know. I will go as far as to argue that it is more important that the teacher knows the editor, and especially the programming language, rather than assigning any importance to one correct editor or one correct language that all teachers should teach.</p>



<p>Years later, though, I still teach vim and the command line. So here is how I justify my decision, even if only to myself.</p>



<p>It just works. Every time I go to a new school, it takes time to get the software installed necessary to run IDEs. I remember walking into one school in which the AP CS A class was flailing away with Eclipse on Mac OS X because the students needed, and didn’t have, administrator access. I have an amazing tech department at my current job, but even here it took us weeks to figure out how to deploy Visual Studio Code on the student’s MacBook Airs and then we had to figure out how to deploy Python3 and Java. So there’s no confusion, I teach vim along with many IDEs and I fully believe it is my responsibility to teach multiple platforms and multiple IDEs, but the CLI and vim are always my safety net.</p>



<p>My students can program in any number of of languages on a now cloud based CLI Linux machine (thank you <a href="https://www.linode.com/">Linode</a> and <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> – both of whom offer a $5/month plan – just. happy customer!). By using the CLI, I can support literally any type of computer connecting (including iPads, although the lack of a virtual esc key drives me batty as a vim user, and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-shell-app/pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo?hl=en">ChromeBooks</a>). Students can connect from anywhere in the world and things just work. All of this became infinitely important in the remote and hybrid learning experience of the pandemic. And this is all possible because the students use vim.</p>



<p>I keep track of as many of my students that major in CS and a running theme is they all profusely thank me for teaching them vim and the CLI. Too many colleges start CS1 with an IDE and then throw the CS2 students into the deep end with the CLI. Not everyone is as lucky as I was in regards to having a father well versed in the CLI.</p>



<p>And yes, there are online IDEs these days, but I’ve found those to be full of their own pitfalls, privacy issues, and costs and find doing any advanced work using them to be very difficult if not impossible.</p>



<p>Also, to be clear, both nano and Emacs work quite well in the context of CLI Linux and I don’t make any claim that teachers should use vim over those equally acceptable command line text editors except for one small argument. Most people agree, computer security pretty much requires knowledge of the command line and a text editor. I always tell my students that the one editor they are likely to find already installed on a machine is vim and it is a bad day when you have to install another editor. Maybe just an issue for students interested in ethical penetration testing…</p>

<p>In 2007, just after his cancer diagnosis, Carnegie Mellon professor Randy Pausch gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTugjssqOT0">a well received lecture on Time Management</a>. These are my notes (<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Randy/RandyPauschTimeManagement2007.pdf">slides here</a>, <a href="https://jamesclear.com/great-speeches/time-management-by-randy-pausch">transcript here</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Side note - he is better known for his Last Lecture on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo">Achieving Your Childhood Dreams</a> - ironically given <em>before</em> this Time Management talk.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>We are very good at dealing with money, but very bad at dealing with time. Having an idea of how much your time costs helps you start making tradeoffs better.</li>
    <li>We have to manage our time better than we manage our money. We have money budgets, what about time budgets?</li>
    <li>We are in a "Time Famine" - nobody says they have "too much time". Yet The typical office worker wastes almost 2 hrs a day at work, and 28 hours a week on TV. This isn't just a one-off problem - you can't solve it one week and then go back to normal - it's systemic and requries change in fundamental processes to address this once and for all.</li>
    <li>The goal is to have fun, be happier, lead a more meaningful life. If you're not going to have fun, why do it?</li>
    <li>Being successful doesn't make you manage your time well. Managing your time well does make you successful.</li>
    <li>Turn money into time - Hire someone to do chores. Esp if you have kids.</li>

    <li>But key realization - doing things at the last minute is very expensive. If you push things up to the deadline that's where all the stress comes from</li>
    <li>Make a fake deadline and pretend it is real.</li>

      <p>He often uses humor - noting the optimistic side of his very grim situation, giving some relief to his audience while also reminding them of the importance of his message.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>He is also extremely respectful - being humble to specific members of the audience ("Gabe is REALLY in good shape", "I am NOT smarter than Jim Calhoun", "Am I giving a talk with Alf Weaver in the audience?"), as well as the venue/general audience itself ("there aren't many better PhD programs in history than this one").</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>He brings in personal stories and examples, often involving his wife, and they are usually relatable and funny. His slides use photos from his own life living the things he talks about.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The anecdotes also inject some variety - 40 minutes in he breaks for a tangent about his dog and a tiny debate he had with his wife.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Vocal variation - 53 minutes in he screams "PUT THE CIGARETTE OUT MOM" and that is a nice spike in decibels.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Ending is really good: He ends with actionable things to do, and a nice reminder of why this is important:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"If I haven't changed anything, then we still had a pleasant hour together. If you have changed things, then you'll probably have a lot more time to spend with the ones you love. And that's important, time is all we have. And you may find one day, you have less than you think."</p>

<p>Governments are back on their anti-encryption bullshit again.</p>



<p>Between the <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2020/03/06/earn-it-is-an-attack-on-encryption/">U.S. Senate’s “EARN IT” Act</a>, the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/10/orders-top-eus-timetable-dismantling-end-end-encryption">E.U.’s slew of anti-encryption proposals</a>, and <a href="https://fee.org/articles/australia-s-unprecedented-encryption-law-is-a-threat-to-global-privacy/">Australia’s new anti-encryption law</a>, it’s become clear that the authoritarians in office view online privacy as a threat to their existence.</p>



<p>Normally, when the governments increase their anti-privacy sabre-rattling, technologists start talking more loudly about Tor, Signal, and other privacy technologies (usually only to be drowned out by paranoid people who think Tor and Signal are government backdoors or something stupid; conspiracy theories ruin everything!).</p>



<p><strong>I’m not going to do that.</strong></p>



<p>Instead, I’m going to show you how to add end-to-end encryption to any communication software you’re developing. (Hopefully, I’ll avoid making <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/10/28/bizarre-design-choices-in-zooms-end-to-end-encryption/">any bizarre design decisions</a> along the way.)</p>



<p>But first, some important disclaimers:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Yes, you should absolutely do this.</strong> I don’t care how banal your thing is; if you expect people to use it to communicate with each other, you should make it so that you can never decrypt their communications.</li><li>You should absolutely NOT bill the thing you’re developing as an <em>alternative</em> to Signal or WhatsApp.</li><li>The goal of doing this is to increase the amount of end-to-end encryption deployed on the Internet that the service operator cannot decrypt (even if compelled by court order) and make E2EE normalized. The goal is NOT to compete with highly specialized and peer-reviewed privacy technology.</li><li>I am not a lawyer, I’m some furry who works in cryptography. The contents of this blog post is not legal advice, nor is it endorsed by any company or organization. Ask the <a href="https://eff.org/">EFF</a> for legal questions.</li></ol>



<p>The organization of this blog post is as follows: First, I’ll explain <a href="#symmetric-key-encryption">how to encrypt and decrypt data between users</a>, assuming you have a key. Next, I’ll explain <a href="#key-agreement">how to build an authenticated key exchange</a> and <a href="#session-key-management">a ratcheting protocol to determine the keys used in the first step</a>. Afterwards, I’ll explore <a href="#identity-key-management">techniques for binding authentication keys to identities and managing trust</a>. Finally, I’ll discuss <a href="#backdoor-resistance">strategies for making it impractical to ever backdoor your software (and impossible to silently backdoor it)</a>, just to piss <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">the creeps and tyrants of the world</a> off even more.</p>



<p>You don’t have to implement the full stack of solutions to protect users, but the further you can afford to go, the safer your users will be from privacy-invasive policing.</p>







<h2 id="preliminaries">Preliminaries</h2>



<h3 id="choosing-a-cryptography-library">Choosing a Cryptography Library</h3>



<p>In the examples contained on this page, I will be using the <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/">Sodium cryptography library</a>. Specifically, my example code will be written with the <a href="https://github.com/paragonie/sodium-plus">Sodium-Plus</a> library for JavaScript, since it strikes a good balance between performance and being cross-platform.</p>


<pre title="">const { SodiumPlus } = require('sodium-plus');

(async function() {
     // Select a backend automatically
     const sodium = await SodiumPlus.auto();
     
     // Do other stuff here
})();
</pre>


<p>Libsodium is <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2018/04/03/cryptographic-right-answers.html">generally the correct choice for developing cryptography features in software</a>, and is available in most programming languages,</p>



<p>If you’re prone to choose a different library, you should consult your cryptographer (and yes, you should have one on your payroll if you’re doing things different) about your design choices.</p>



<h3>Threat Modelling</h3>



<p>Remember above when I said, “You don’t have to implement the full stack of solutions to protect users, but the further you can afford to go, the safer your users will be from privacy-invasive policing”?</p>



<p>How far you go in implementing the steps outlined on this blog post should be informed by <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2016/07/20/threat-modeling-for-applications/">a threat model</a>, not an ad hoc judgment.</p>



<p>For example, if you’re encrypting user data and storing it in the cloud, you probably want to pass <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/04/05/icloud-who-holds-key/">the Mud Puddle Test</a>:</p>



<blockquote><div><p>1. First, drop your device(s) in a mud puddle.<br>2. Next, slip in said puddle and crack yourself on the head. When you regain consciousness you’ll be perfectly fine, but<em>&nbsp;won’t for the life of you&nbsp;</em>be able to&nbsp;recall your device passwords or keys.<br>3. Now try to get your cloud data back.</p><p>Did you succeed? If so, you’re screwed. Or to be a bit less dramatic, I should say: your cloud provider has access to your ‘encrypted’ data, as does the government if they want it, as does any rogue employee who knows their way around your provider’s internal policy checks.</p></div><cite>Matthew Green describes the Mud Puddle Test, which Apple products <a href="https://sneak.berlin/20201112/your-computer-isnt-yours/">definitely don’t pass</a>.</cite></blockquote>



<p>If you must fail the Mud Puddle Test for your users, make sure you’re clear and transparent about this in the documentation for your product or service.</p>







<h2 id="symmetric-key-encryption">I. Symmetric-Key Encryption</h2>



<p>The easiest piece of this puzzle is to encrypt data in transit between both ends (thus, satisfying the loosest definition of end-to-end encryption).</p>



<p>At this layer, you already have some kind of symmetric key to use for encrypting data before you send it, and for decrypting it as you receive it.</p>



<p>For example, the following code will encrypt/decrypt strings and return hexadecimal strings with a version prefix.</p>


<pre title="">const VERSION = "v1";

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function encryptData(message, key, assocData = null) {
    const nonce = await sodium.randombytes_buf(24);
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': VERSION,
      'nonce': await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce),
      'extra': assocData
    });

    const encrypted = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_encrypt(
        message,
        nonce,
        key,
        aad
    );
    return (
       VERSION +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce) +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(encrypted)
    );
}

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function decryptData(encrypted, key, assocData = null) {
    const ver = encrypted.slice(0, 2);
    if (!await sodium.sodium_memcmp(ver, VERSION)) {
        throw new Error("Incorrect version: " + ver);
    }
    const nonce = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(2, 50));
    const ciphertext = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(50));
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': ver,
      'nonce': encrypted.slice(2, 50),
      'extra': assocData
    });
    
    const plaintext = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_decrypt(
        ciphertext,
        nonce,
        key,
        aad
    );
    return plaintext.toString('utf-8');
}
</pre>


<p>Under-the-hood, this is using <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/07/12/comparison-of-symmetric-encryption-methods/#aes-gcm-vs-xchacha20poly1305">XChaCha20-Poly1305</a>, which is less sensitive to timing leaks than AES-GCM. However, like AES-GCM, this encryption mode doesn’t provide <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/016">message- or key-commitment</a>.</p>



<p>If you want key commitment, you should derive two keys from <code>$key</code> using a KDF based on hash functions: One for actual encryption, and the other <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1153">as a key commitment value</a>.</p>



<p>If you want message commitment, you can use AES-CTR + HMAC-SHA256 or XChaCha20 + BLAKE2b-MAC.</p>



<p>If you want both, ask <a href="https://mumble.net/~campbell/">Taylor Campbell</a> about his BLAKE3-based design.</p>



<p>A modified version of the above code with key-commitment might look like this:</p>


<pre title="">const VERSION = "v2";

/**
 * Derive an encryption key and a commitment hash.
 * @param {CryptographyKey} key
 * @param {Uint8Array} nonce
 * @returns {{encKey: CryptographyKey, commitment: Uint8Array}}
 */
async function deriveKeys(key, nonce) {
    const encKey = new CryptographyKey(await sodium.crypto_generichash(
        new Uint8Array([0x01].append(nonce)),
        key
    ));
    const commitment = await sodium.crypto_generichash(
        new Uint8Array([0x02].append(nonce)),
        key
    );
    return {encKey, commitment};
}

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function encryptData(message, key, assocData = null) {
    const nonce = await sodium.randombytes_buf(24);
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': VERSION,
      'nonce': await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce),
      'extra': assocData
    });
    const {encKey, commitment} = await deriveKeys(key, nonce);

    const encrypted = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_encrypt(
        message,
        nonce,
        encKey,
        aad
    );
    return (
       VERSION +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce) +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(commitment) +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(encrypted)
    );
}

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}

<p>Another design choice you might make is to encode ciphertext with base64 instead of hexadecimal. That doesn’t significantly alter the design here, but it does mean your decoding logic has to accommodate this.</p>



<p>You SHOULD version your ciphertexts, and include this in the AAD provided to your AEAD encryption mode. I used “v1” and “v2” as a version string above, but you can use your software name for that too.</p>

<p>Antibiotic resistance could <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/12/oneill-rpt-amr/">cost the world $100 trillion by 2050</a>, and approximately kills 700,000 per year. Some in the scientific community say it could be as bad as cancer. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has emerged as one of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4768623/">principal public health problems</a> of the 21st century. The World Health Organisation published <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/27-02-2017-who-publishes-list-of-bacteria-for-which-new-antibiotics-are-urgently-needed">a list of bacteria of which new antibiotics are urgently needed</a>, and superbug “Staph” was Priority high. It’s a <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn25498-antibiotic-resistant-superbugs-now-a-global-epidemic/">global epidemic</a>.</p>



<p>We should be rational optimists, as Matt Ridley explains with evidence in his book. Through science and technology the world gets better via our collective brain.</p>



<p><a href="https://botanixpharma.com/">Botanix Pharmaceuticals</a> (Botanix) has made a scientific breakthrough. In September 2020, Botanix proved its product&nbsp; BTX 1801 kills superbug Staph (aka MRSA or golden Staph) without allowing resistance to develop. <a href="https://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20200908/pdf/44mf662gw8dbkd.pdf">It was done in human skin</a>. This product is designed for Surgical Site Infections (SSI) which costs hospitals US$10 billion per year. The Phase 2a study is due in Q4 2020. They did this a year after they <a href="https://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20190801/pdf/4473szphv8b084.pdf">raised US$40 million at a valuation of US$198 million</a>.</p>



<p>There was already evidence Cannabidiol (CBD) was antibacterial, which is used in the product. This new data supports bigger studies for a potential new antibiotic. There is a big need for new antibiotics due to antibiotic resistance. The problem is that it is very hard to make these scientific breakthroughs. Botanix has made a breakthrough for the world, and the data will be used by other scientists to save lives. Botanix also has a cash runway to take its clinical pipeline to December 2021 (excluding FDA approved Phase 3 Acne).</p>



<p>There are <a href="https://www.infectiousdiseaseadvisor.com/home/decision-support-in-medicine/hospital-infection-control/surgical-site-infections/">approximately 27 million</a> surgical procedures in the U.S per year. Approximately 5% get infected, which leads to 1.35 million SSI’s per year in the U.S. Occurrence of SSI is estimated to increase hospital stay by 7 to 10 days and add over <a href="https://www.infectiousdiseaseadvisor.com/home/decision-support-in-medicine/hospital-infection-control/surgical-site-infections/">$3,000 in costs of care</a>. Globally, <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5435b2b9e4b0e1fd29fa9d26/t/5aa2b3374192023932fb6690/1520612157567/Surgical%26AnaesthesiaDataReport.pdf">there are approximately 313 million</a> surgical procedures per year. If 5% of surgical procedures lead to infections, that’s 15.6 million SSI’s globally.</p>



<p>In the U.S there are 1.35 million SSI’s per year, multiply that by $3,000 costs, and it equals $4 billion. SSI’s cost U.S hospitals $4 billion per year. If BTX 1801 is priced at $100, that equals $135 million yearly revenue in the U.S – a huge drop in hospital costs. Presume the product will last 10 years, and that equals $1.3 billion in revenue. Globally, potential annual revenue could be $1.5 billion (SSI’s multiplied by the $100 price).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Keep in mind that this is 1 of 3 products in the Botanix clinical pipeline. Pending studies are FDA approved <a href="http://marksita.com/botanix-pharmaceuticals">Phase 3 Acne</a> and Phase 2 Rosacea.</p>



<p>A recent study found it costs on average <a href="https://amr.solutions/2020/03/06/what-does-an-antibiotic-cost-to-develop-what-is-it-worth-how-to-afford-it/">$1.3 billion to get a new drug approved</a>. By using synthetic Cannabidiol, Botanix is able to make significantly better drugs. Botanix has a competitive advantage, and the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/fast-track-breakthrough-therapy-accelerated-approval-priority-review/fast-track">FDA Fast Track Status</a> application (due to the <a href="https://smallcaps.com.au/botanix-pharmaceuticals-receives-fda-grant-antibacterial-product-btx-1801/">FDA Qualified Infectious Disease Product</a> status) will make it stronger.</p>



<p>Antibiotics is the <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/rearvision/antibiotics-dilemma-running-out-of-drugs-to-treat-superbugs/7281438">$40 billion drug market</a> that no company wants a part of. <strong>Until now.</strong></p>
