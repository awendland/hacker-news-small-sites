<div>
<p><strong>Wireguard is a Virtual Private Network (VPN) technology that aims to enable the easy deployment and configuration of servers and clients. Wireguard is intended to replace the use of IPSec or OpenVPN for many VPN applications.</strong> </p>



<p>Wireguard offers both kernel and userspace implementations. The in-kernel version is faster, but must be customized for each OS, and not every OS supports this yet. The first kernel implementation was offered for Linux, but there is now an in-kernel implementations for FreeBSD, and also one for OpenBSD, with a NetBSD implementation in progress. Wireguard needed crypto primitives that were not present in FreeBSD, having high quality native support required a large amount of work and communication with the upstream Wireguard project. The FreeBSD kernel implementation was written by Matt Macy with sponsorship from NetGate, without this vendor support it is unlikely that a project of this size would have been successful.</p>



<p>The main userspace implementation of wireguard is a golang application and it is available via the wireguard-go tool available in FreeBSD ports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A wireguard network configuration is formed of interfaces and peers. Each interface is defined by its private key, peers are defined by their public key and the set of addresses they are allowed to use. This forms a network that uses cryptokey routing.</p>

<p>With cryptokey routing, hosts are defined by their cryptographic keys, where public keys are used as identifiers. This means that most of the configuration for wireguard requires dealing with these public keys. Wireguard does not specify mechanisms for key distribution and management, and it is fair to compare this with the distribution of ssh keys. Unlike ssh, the public keys need to be available for both sides of the connection.</p>



<p>Wireguard uses INI files for static configuration, a config file might look like:</p>



<pre><code>[Interface]
PrivateKey = EO9b4bV1qg0veyFelERv69v4eamKu/evGZ/Hbiq82Eg=
ListenPort = 51820

[Peer]
PublicKey = ZBF6vo22sBkT0ro/xnlZ0EZsFGTYPTOvY8luFFtJwwk=    
AllowedIPs = 10.10.0.2/32

[Peer]
PublicKey = fnpAo3hMf9UOtPpM+CUtpB+ETvB5XjNLIuTGsX+qnCc
AllowedIPs = 10.10.0.138/32

[Peer]
PublicKey = Tpdhd68aaDAQfNsnqzoViMl1h+yHeYuVZ22xrY1BM0I=
AllowedIPs = 10.10.0.3/32, 192.168.2.1/24
</code></pre>



<p>The allowed IP addresses act as a routing table. When traffic is sent, the packet is compared to the peer’s AllowedIPs, and if it matches the address or the subnet, the packet is encrypted using the peer’s public key and forwarded over the tunnel in its direction.</p>



<p>On receipt of a packet, AllowedIPs acts as a receive filter. The packet is first decrypted and authenticated, and then it is evaluated against the AllowedIPs to verify that it is allowed to enter the network.</p>



<h4><strong>Installation</strong></h4>



<p>Wireguard makes a serious effort to make the tools it offers consistent on all platforms. To do this, there are two components that determine whether the kernel or userspace implementation is used. The first is a method to create a wireguard interface; this is the component that changes between kernel and userspace versions, then there is a single configuration wg(8) tool to manage the VPN.</p>



<p>This approach intends to smooth over platform configuration differences. The platform specific part is creating and configuring the network interface, but the VPN configuration should all be manageable with a single consistent tool.</p>



<p>FreeBSD has an in-kernel implementation of wireguard that landed in the tree in&nbsp;<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&amp;revision=368163">November 2020</a>. The in-kernel implementation is still very fresh, so in this article we will use the userspace tool, as it is available in the most supported versions of FreeBSD today. The in-kernel implementation key generation is still performed using the wg(8) tool.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We can install wg(8) and wireguard-go (the wireguard userspace implementation) from ports with:</p>



<pre><code># pkg install wireguard wireguard-tools</code></pre>



<h4><strong>Creating Keys</strong></h4>



<p>Our host’s identity is defined by its key pair. We need to generate a wireguard private key using the&nbsp;wg genkey&nbsp;command; wireguard helpfully (if frustratingly) insists that we don’t place the private key in a world readable file. To generate the key and append it to a file, we need to temporally change our umask:</p>



<pre><code># (umask 0077; wg genkey &gt; private.key)
# cat private.key
MOtM8w02ONtGK9vmLCXlx6em+5pRTm6C0z7HCeIrPlY=
</code></pre>



<p>This command creates a private key and places it into a file called private.key. We can view the private key by catting the file; anyone with the private key can act as the server, so you should be very careful with your wireguard private keys. Wireguard tools will typically censor the private key in output unless additional flags are given.&nbsp;</p>



<div data-columns="3" data-layout="50-25-25"><div>




<div><div>
<p>Did you know?</p>



<h2>You can maximize the <strong>power of your FreeBSD</strong> infrastructure with our <strong>Support Subscription!</strong></h2>




</div></div>




</div></div>



<p>Wireguard uses our public key as our identity, wg(8) will show us the public key for a private key with the&nbsp;<em>wg pubkeycommand</em>:</p>



<pre><code># wg pubkey &lt; private.key
APWANIrAD3drcSNUdDuUuXLsCRksKxuQxwBHf56UxiM=
</code></pre>



<h4><strong>Server Side</strong></h4>



<p>First, let’s configure our server side. The server is going to act as the central host in our network with several clients connecting to it for access. This host needs to have a stable public IP and a known shared port to accept wireguard traffic on.</p>



<p>We need to generate keys for the server:</p>



<pre><code>wg-server (umask 0077; wg genkey &gt; server.key)
wg-server # cat server.key
AJKFyhDoLfLnlclEcKV97bRonVKGgEbRGi7vGfeYNnw=
wg-server # wg pubkey &lt; server.key      # show the public key for this private key
j2klzAC0RnWOOUAcZw+/GEtp5URCSwf9r3yW+JYJRRE=
</code></pre>



<p>Next, there are a few steps to set up the network. We need to create a wireguard interface using wireguard-go:</p>



<pre><code>wg-server # wireguard-go wg0
INFO: (wg0) 2021/01/08 14:35:42 Starting wireguard-go version 0.0.20200320
</code></pre>



<p>This interface needs to be configured to have an address in our private network on the host and a route to direct traffic into the wireguard tunnel. We use the wg(8) tool to configure the interface’s private key.</p>



<pre><code>wg-server # ifconfig wg0 inet 10.10.0.1/24 10.10.0.1
wg-client # route add 10.10.0.0/24 -interface wg0
wg-server # wg set wg0 private-key ./server.key listen-port 51820
</code></pre>



<p>If we don’t specify the listen port here, then wireguard will select a random port when the wg0 interface is brought up. For a destination server like this, we need to have a consistent port between addresses, and so we use one common to wireguard here.</p>



<pre><code>wg-server # ifconfig wg0 down
wg-server # ifconfig wg0 up
</code></pre>



<p>Finally, we need to configure each peer with its public key and the IP addresses it is allowed to use:</p>



<pre><code>wg-server # wg set wg0 peer &lt;peer pubkey&gt; allowed-ips 10.10.0.2/32 </code></pre>



<h4><strong>FreeBSD Client</strong></h4>



<p>Each client needs to go through similar steps: first create a private key to identify the client:</p>



<pre><code>wg-client (umask 0077; wg genkey &gt; client.key)
wg-client # cat client.key
gM3ydSBBTZOw1nzIyV/nxJuONB8/MNe/RhcOikQbE3Y=
wg-client # wg pubkey &lt; client.key      # show the public key for this private key
jILr21Xt+3sXDZepu5Z3syuJMXyc29f5GBXHZFPulEE=
</code></pre>



<p>We need to create the wireguard interface by running wireguard-go:</p>



<pre><code>wg-client # wireguard-go wg0            # create the wg0 interface</code></pre>



<p>This interface is then configured for the internal VPN network. wireguard-go creates a tun interface, and tun interfaces need to be configured with a source and destination address. As that is not important here, we can use the same address for both parts. To make sure we can reach the internal network properly, we also need to add a route:</p>



<pre><code>wg-client # ifconfig wg0 inet 10.10.0.2/24 10.10.0.2
wg-client # route add 10.10.0.0/24 -interface wg0
</code></pre>



<p>With the interface configured, we can now configure wireguard:</p>



<pre>wg-client # wg set wg0 private-key ./client.key&nbsp;</pre>



<p>Finally, we need to configure the wg0 interface with an endpoint for the server:</p>



<pre><code>wg-client # ifconfig wg0 down
wg-client # ifconfig wg0 up
wg-client # wg set wg0 peer &lt;peer pubkey&gt; allowed-ips 10.10.0.0/24 endpoint 192.0.2.42:51820
</code></pre>



<p>When we configured the client peer, we told wireguard where to find the server with the endpoint parameter. In this case the client doesn’t listen on a predictable port, but instead it first has to create the wireguard tunnel with the server when traffic needs to be sent.</p>



<p>Now that we have created and configured our client, we need to add its public key and allowed-ip addresses to the server.</p>



<pre><code>wg-server # wg set wg0 peer jILr21Xt+3sXDZepu5Z3syuJMXyc29f5GBXHZFPulEE= allowed-ips 10.10.0.2/32 </code></pre>



<p>Finally we can test the set up using ping:</p>



<pre><code>wg-client # ping 10.10.0.1
PING 10.10.0.1 (10.10.0.1): 56 data bytes                 
64 bytes from 10.10.0.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=3.253 ms  
64 bytes from 10.10.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=1.358 ms  
64 bytes from 10.10.0.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=1.089 ms                                                            
64 bytes from 10.10.0.1: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=1.649 ms                                                            
^C                           
</code></pre>



<p>Wireguard is not a ‘chatty’ protocol. If there is no traffic to send from the client for a long time, and it doesn’t have a fixed address, the server can ‘forget’ how to reach the client.</p>



<p>It might be the case that the client is behind a NAT network. To support this case, wireguard supports the<em>&nbsp;persistent-keepalive&nbsp;</em>configuration option. This option is disabled by default, but it allows our client to receive packets from the server when it is not sending traffic itself.</p>



<p>RFC4787 recommends a 2 minute timeout interval for NATs and middleboxes, but recent UDP protocols (such as QUIC), recommend sending packets every 30 seconds to prevent middleboxes from&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/1879141.1879174">losing state for UDP flows</a>.</p>



<p>If you need the tunnel connection kept alive, add the&nbsp;persistent-keepalive&nbsp;parameter:</p>



<pre><code>wg-client # wg set wg0 peer &lt;peer pubkey&gt; allowed-ips 10.10.0.0/24 persistent-keepalive 30 endpoint 192.0.2.42:51820</code></pre>

<p>The pandemic has subsided; the number of people who have recovered from COVID19 (SARS-CoV-2) have been steadily rising. With this new development, the question of how long the immunity against the virus will last remains a cause for concern for experts, including the general public.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.rockefeller.edu/news/30005-sars-cov-2-immune-response-improves-long-term-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new study</a> has found that the immunity against COVID-19 post recovery remains for at least six months and likely even longer.</p>
<p><span>In the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03207-w#citeas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paper published</a> in the journal <em>Nature</em>, the researchers note that the immune system studies the nature of the virus remarkably well and strategize itself to develop better and more effective antibodies even after the infection has abated.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p>Now before we get further into detail, let’s first understand how our immune system protects us from many different types of unwanted invaders, including viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungi, and how it helps us attain immunity against them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The immune system is an army of cells, tissues, and organs that coordinate the bodily defenses against any threats. The white blood cells, also known as leukocytes, are one of the most important cells involved in the process, and they circulate throughout the body and make sure there are not any unwanted foreign invaders that may harm us.</p>



<p>There are two divisions of leukocytes, and they are: phagocytes and lymphocytes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phagocytes are the first cells to trigger <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000821.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immune response</a>; they destroy any foreign cells they encounter through ingestion. This helps them identify the antigen present in the foreign cells, and transmit this information to lymphocytes, which then hunt for infected body cells and annihilate them completely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lymphocytes unit of the immune system comprises of two major cellular components called B-cells and T-cells. These cells utilize the information collected from the antigens to recognize any unwanted visitors in the future. So once a threat makes another visit, the cells will unleash the right antibodies to destroy the invaders. This is how our body develops immunity against certain diseases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the effectiveness of immune response decreases with time as the level of antibodies drops after a certain period. So in order to deal with pathogens more efficiently, the immune system doesn’t always produce antibodies, instead it resorts to creating memory B-cells that easily recognize the pathogen and release a new batch of antibodies upon re-exposure to the any unwanted visitors.</p>



<p>In the study, the researchers found that these antibodies emerged post SARS-CoV-2 infection are the results of immune cells working in choir to evolve while simultaneously being constantly exposed to hidden remnants of the virus in the intestinal wall. And as a result, the next time a recovered patient contracts the virus, their body will initiate a rapid immune response to the virus, hence preventing reinfection. However, the efficacy of this memory on warding off the infection is solely determined by the nature of the pathogen the person has contracted with.</p>



<p>For the study, the researchers assessed the antibody responses of 87 participants at two separate time-points: one month following infection, and then again after six months. They found that although the antibodies lingered on the participants’ blood plasma for six months, there were significant drops in their levels and as a result of that, the ability to neutralize the virus plummeted five-fold.</p>



<p>Surprisingly however, the subsequent batch of antibodies produced by the memory B cells in patients, increased in some cases. The researches have specified that the overall numbers of memory B-cells that unleashed antibodies that attack the receptor-binding domain of the virus, remained the same. These antibodies are the ones that will fend off the virus upon re-encounter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, upon closer inspection at the memory B cells, the team also found that these cells had mutated many times over even after the infection waned, and this made the antibodies the cells created outperformed the originals in staving off the virus. Moreover, this new set of antibodies could latch on to the virus and even identify the mutated versions of it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They have been found to be able to identify even the mutated version of SARS-CoV-2 including <a href="https://theconversation.com/south-african-scientists-who-discovered-new-covid-19-variant-share-what-they-know-153313" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South African Variants</a> (called 501Y.V2) that have undergone mutations for more than 20 times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The memory B cells of course mutate and deploy antibodies at times of infections like HIV or herpes, but seeing them evolve with SARS-CoV-2, which is believed to wither soon after infection has resolved, was never expected until now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SARS-Cov-2 thrives and replicates in the upper respiratory tract. However, upon examining biopsies of intestinal tissue from recovered patients, its genetic materials and proteins were detected within it. The researchers conjecture this could be what’s fueling the evolution of memory B-cells.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The infectiousness of these viral remnants are yet to be determined. In the future, the team plans to understand the role these viral remnants play in immunity as well as in the progression of the disease by making more participants involved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study has been published in the journal <em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03207-w#citeas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nature</a></em>:</p>

<p>Some critics think the curl project shouldn’t use GitHub. The reasons for being against GitHub hosting tend to be one or more of:</p>



<ol><li>it is an evil proprietary platform</li><li>it is run by Microsoft and they are evil</li><li> GitHub is American thus evil</li></ol>



<p>Some have insisted on craziness like “we let GitHub hold our source code hostage”.</p>



<h2>Why GitHub?</h2>



<p>The curl project <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2010/03/23/curl-goes-git/">switched to GitHub</a> (from Sourceforge) almost eleven years ago and it’s been a smooth ride ever since.</p>



<p>We’re on GitHub not only because it provides a myriad of practical features and is a stable and snappy service for hosting and managing source code. GitHub is also a developer hub for millions of developers who already have accounts and are familiar with the GitHub style of developing, the terms and the tools. By being on GitHub, we reduce friction from the contribution process and we maximize the ability for others to join in and help. We lower the bar. This is good for us.</p>



<p>I like GitHub.</p>



<h2>Self-hosting is not better</h2>



<p>Providing even close to the same uptime and snappy response times with a self-hosted service is a challenge, and it would take someone time and energy to volunteer that work – time and energy we now instead can spend of developing the project instead. As a small independent open source project, we don’t have any “infrastructure department” that would do it for us. And trust me: we already have enough infrastructure management to deal with without having to add to that pile.</p>



<p>… and by running our own hosted version, we would lose the “network effect” and convenience for people that already are on and know the platform. We would also lose the easy integration with cool services like the many different CI and code analyzer jobs we run.</p>



<h2>Proprietary is not the issue</h2>



<p>While git is open source, GitHub is a proprietary system. But the thing is that even if we would go with a competitor and get our code hosting done elsewhere, our code would still be stored on a machine somewhere in a remote server park we cannot physically access – ever. It doesn’t matter if that hosting company uses open source or proprietary code. If they decide to switch off the servers one day, or even just selectively block our project, there’s nothing we can do to get our stuff back out from there.</p>



<p>We have to work so that we minimize the risk for it and the effects from it if it still happens.</p>



<p>A proprietary software platform holds our code just as much hostage as any free or open source software platform would, simply by the fact that we let someone else host it. They run the servers our code is stored on.</p>



<h2>If GitHub takes the ball and goes home</h2>



<p>No matter which service we use, there’s always a risk that they will turn off the light one day and not come back – or just change the rules or licensing terms that would prevent us from staying there. We cannot avoid that risk. But we can make sure that we’re smart about it, have a contingency plan or at least an idea of what to do when that day comes.</p>



<p>If GitHub shuts down immediately and we get zero warning to rescue anything at all from them, what would be the result for the curl project?</p>



<p><strong>Code.</strong> We would still have the entire git repository with all code, all source history and all existing branches up until that point. We’re hundreds of developers who pull that repository frequently, and many automatically, so there’s a very distributed backup all over the world.</p>



<p><strong>CI</strong>. Most of our CI setup is done with yaml config files in the source repo. If we transition to another hosting platform, we could reuse them.</p>



<p><strong>Issues</strong>. Bug reports and pull requests are stored on GitHub and a sudden exit would definitely make us lose some of them. We do daily “extractions” of all issues and pull-requests so a lot of meta-data could still be saved and preserved. I don’t think this would be a terribly hard blow either: we move long-standing bugs and ideas over to documents in the repository, so the currently open ones are likely possible to get resubmitted again within the nearest future.</p>



<p>There’s no doubt that it would be a significant speed bump for the project, but it would not be worse than that. We could bounce back on a new platform and development would go on <em>within days</em>.</p>



<h2>Low risk</h2>



<p>It’s a rare thing, that a service just suddenly with no warning and no heads up would just go black and leave projects completely stranded. In most cases, we get alerts, notifications and get a chance to transition cleanly and orderly.</p>



<h2>There are alternatives</h2>



<p>Sure there are alternatives. Both pure GitHub alternatives that look similar and provide similar services, and projects that would allow us to run similar things ourselves and host locally. There are many options.</p>



<p><strong>I’m not looking for alternatives. I’m not planning to switch hosting anytime soon!</strong> As mentioned above, I think GitHub is a net positive for the curl project.</p>



<h2>Nothing lasts forever</h2>



<p>We’ve switched services several times before and I’m expecting that we will change again in the future, for all sorts of hosting and related project offerings that we provide to the work and to the developers and participators within the project. Nothing lasts forever.</p>



<p>When  a service we use goes down or just turns sour, we will figure out the best possible replacement and take the jump. Then we patch up all the cracks the jump may have caused and continue the race into the future. Onward and upward. The way we know and the way we’ve done for over twenty years already. </p>

<h2>Updates</h2>



<p>After this blog post went live, some users remarked than I’m “<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/bfxd28">disingenuous</a>” in the list of reasons at the top, that people have presented to me.  This, because I don’t mention the moral issues staying on GitHub present – like for example previously reported workplace conflicts and their association with hideous American immigration authorities.</p>



<p>This is rather the opposite of  disingenuous. This is the truth. Not a single person have <em>ever</em> asked me to leave GitHub for those reasons. Not me personally, and nobody has asked it out to the wider project either.</p>



<p>These are good reasons to discuss and consider if a service should be used. Have there been violations of “decency” significant enough that should make us leave? Have we crossed that line in the sand? I’m leaning to “no” now, but I’m always listening to what curl users and developers say. Where do you think the line is drawn?</p>

January 27, 2021 | https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>
I am often asked what I mean when I say that developers spend most of their time figuring the system out. Let’s unpack the statement.
</p>
<p>
The oldest reference on the topic I know of dates back to 1979 in a book by Zelkowitz, Shaw, and Gannon entitled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Principles-software-engineering-design-Prentice-Hall/dp/013710202X">Principles of software engineering and design</a>. It said that most of the development time was spent on maintenance (67%).
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/pictures/1979-graph-picture.png" alt="Software development costs (1979)">
	<figcaption>Software development costs (1979)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Granted, the book does not specify how the figure was obtained. Still, it was deemed an important enough problem to attract significant research attention since then.
</p>
<p>
So, how far are we now, more than 4 decades later?
</p>
<p>
Let’s look at a recent paper by Xia, Bao, Lo, Xing, Hassan, &amp; Li entitled <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318811113_Measuring_Program_Comprehension_A_Large-Scale_Field_Study_with_Professionals">Measuring Program Comprehension: A Large-Scale Field Study with Professionals</a> and published in IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 44, 951-976, 2018. This paper is quite interesting in that it describes in great details how the figures are obtained. And it says that Comprehension took on average ~58%.
</p>
<p>
Now, take a closer look at the results table.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/pictures/2018-costs.png" alt="Software development costs (2018)">
	<figcaption>Software development costs (2018)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
In particular, take a look at the third column in the table: it says Navigation accounts for 24% of the effort, and that is considered separately from the Comprehension effort!
</p>
<p>
So, after 4 decades, we can observe that not much has changed beside learning how to measure the “figuring out” time.
</p>
<p>
So what?
</p>
<p>
Well, that is the single largest expense we have. If we want to optimize anything in our discipline we should look at this part first. We talk often about how we build systems, but how often do you talk about how you spend the “figuring out" time? If we do not talk about it, it’s not explicit. If it’s not explicit, it does not get optimized.
</p>
<p>
If we do talk about how the “figuring out the system” time is spent, we notice that people spend it reading. In fact, as the above paper also shows, comprehension is essentially measured as reading! The two are considered as mostly synonymous.
</p>
<p>
So, how should we talk about how we figure the system out?
</p>
<p>
Given that not much happened for 4 decades, we should entertain the idea that maybe we should frame the problem differently. 
</p>
<p>
Please, bear with me. This is where it gets interesting. So, why do developers read code? Because they want to figure the situation enough to know what to do next. The intent is important. This is decision making.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/pictures/decision-making.png" alt="The figuring out time is a decision making time">
	<figcaption>The figuring out time is a decision making time</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
From this perspective, reading is just the means through which information is gathered from data. It also happens to be the most manual possible way to do that, so this lends itself to an important opportunity for optimization.
</p>
<p>
Before you can do something significant about anything, you have to name it. Otherwise it's like with Voldemort. <a href="http://humane-assessment.com/">Many winters ago</a>, I called the effort of “figuring the system out to know what to do next" assessment. And I claimed we should optimize development around it.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/pictures/assessment.png" alt="Assessment is the process of understanding a situation around a system enough to make a decision">
	<figcaption>Assessment is the process of understanding a situation around a system enough to make a decision</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
For a whole decade my colleagues and I explored this idea. And it led us to what we now call moldable development.
</p>
<p>
What’s that?
</p>
<p>
Reading is the most manual way to extract information out of data. It does not scale and leads to incomplete information &amp; uncertainty.
</p>
<p>
Software is hard enough. Not knowing what the current system is like should not be an acceptable variable in the equation. A hand drawn picture about the current system is a belief. Decisions should never be based on beliefs. Not in engineering.
</p>
<p>
Once we accept that systems are data, it becomes obvious we should approach it like data, too. Data science tells us that you first start from the problem and then reason through a tool that matches the context.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/pictures/molding.png" alt="Tools should match the context">
	<figcaption>Tools should match the context</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
 As software is highly contextual we cannot predict specific problems. We can only predict classes of problems. To handle this, the key idea of moldable development is that the tool should be moldable after knowing the problem. In this way it can deal with what's important in context, and because of it, it can take care of the boring part of reading. Of course, for this to be practical, the cost of creating custom tools must be small.
</p>
<p>
I see the flow of constructing custom tools during development, and, ideally, for every single development problem, as the next major leap in software development.
</p>
<p>
In a decade from now, we should not be measuring the "figuring the system out” in terms of reading. We should occupy our energy with solving actual problems. To get there we should start by talking about how not to read code. We cannot afford not to.
</p>
<p>
We created <a href="https://gtoolkit.com/">Glamorous Toolkit</a> to provide a concrete start for the "how not to read code" conversation. Glamorous Toolkit is a moldable development environment that makes it possible to create custom tools about software systems inexpensively.
</p>
<p>
So, go to <a href="https://gtoolkit.com/">gtoolkit.com</a>. Play with it. Feel #MoldableDevelopment.
</p>
<p>
And do engage with us: <a href="https://discord.gg/FTJr9gP">discord.gg/FTJr9gP</a>.
</p>
<p>
Let’s make that conversation happen.

<p>Published on <span id="pubdate">2020-01-18</span>. Modified on <span id="moddate">2020-03-13</span>.</p>
<p>As an operating system GNU/Linux has become a mess because of the fragmented nature of the project, the bloatware in the kernel, and because of the jerking around by commercial interests. There exist several technical reasons for when a migration from GNU/Linux to BSD might make sense, but this article isn't about that, it's an opinionated rant, more than anything else.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In the past I have always been a favorite of choosing operating system and tools based upon technical merit. However, in today's world of companies like Microsoft, Apple, Google, and many others, compromising user privacy, and conducting controversial activities, I don't believe that to be the right cause of action.</p>
<p>Proprietary operating systems like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10#Privacy_and_data_collection">Microsoft Windows 10</a>, <a href="https://gist.github.com/iosecure/357e724811fe04167332ef54e736670d">Apple MacOS</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_%28operating_system%29#Security_and_privacy">Google Android</a> have become famous for their ill conduct, and even companies like Lenovo is using UEFI boot to inject custom Windows components, so that the system can phone home to Lenovo.</p>
<p>As a result of all this I have been a proponent for the Open Source alternatives, like GNU/Linux and BSD, for a very long time. Not only that, I also believe that the Open Source alternatives are much better in many technical areas.</p>
<p>I have also always been very much against <a href="https://www.unixsheikh.com/articles/the-typical-discussions-about-bsd-vs-linux.html">The typical discussions about BSD vs Linux</a>, and as I wrote in my article back then, I have always believed that the different Open Source projects can help each other and cooperate in kindness, and that end-users should only debate such issues from a technical stand point rather than personal preference.</p>
<p>Whenever it has been possible, I have proposed people, both private and in the industry, to change the operating systems they use to Open Source alternatives, and when people have been receptive to my advocacy I have helped them migrate from Microsoft Windows on their workstations to something like Linux Mint, Xubuntu, or Debian GNU/Linux. And on the server side I have used both BSD and GNU/Linux. This has been a successful endeavor and I have honestly never experienced a dissatisfied person.</p>
<p>However, things are beginning to change in the GNU/Linux world as more and more companies want to control the direction of the project. Due to the structure and organization of GNU/Linux as an operating system, it is unfortunately susceptible to these influences, and while it is still Open Source, and still not anywhere near the bad things that is going on with the proprietary alternatives, some opt-out features have slowly been introduced into both the kernel and systemd.</p>
<p>You can still choose to opt-out of these features and go your merry way, but as an Open Source enthusiast and proponent, and as a privacy concerned individual, perhaps the better approach is to migrate systems to something where you don't have to concern yourself with "creepware".</p>
<p>As a system administrator I don't want to worry about whether I am going to be surprised the next time I upgrade a system, and I don't want to keep a list of things I have to remember to opt-out of whenever I run one of these systems.</p>
<p>Several Linux distributions have decided (not only because of privacy opt-out issues, but other issues as well) to implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Linux_distributions_without_systemd">other init solutions than systemd</a>, but with the situation going on in the kernel development, and with many third party applications becoming more and dependent upon systemd, the problems are spreading to other parts of the system and I believe this is becoming an uphill battle.</p>
<p>I don't believe the future of GNU/Linux looks as bright as it used too, and as a possible alternative solution I suggest migrating everything (when possible) to something a bit more sane, like the BSD projects.</p>
<h2 id="fragmented">Linux is fragmented</h2>
<p>In 1983 Richard Stallman announced his intent to start coding the GNU Project in a Usenet message. By June 1987, the project had accumulated and developed free and Open Source software for an assembler, an almost finished portable optimizing C compiler (GCC), an editor (GNU Emacs), and various Unix utilities, such as ls, grep, awk, make and ld.</p>
<p>In 1991, the Linux kernel appeared, developed outside the GNU project by Linus Torvalds, and in December 1992 it was made available under version 2 of the GNU General Public License. Combined with the operating system utilities already developed by the GNU project, it became the GNU/Linux operating system, better known as just "Linux".</p>
<p>Then came the Linux distributions. Different projects took the Linux kernel, the GNU tools and libraries, additional third party software, documentation, the X Window System, a window manager, and a desktop environment, and combined those components into the distributions. Different distributions focused on different goals, some put focus on the desktop while others put their main focus on servers, and again others tried to provide a multi-purpose operating system.</p>
<p>In the past all these different components and projects where developed by Open Source enthusiasts and the passion for programming and Open Source was the driving force.</p>
<p>This is no longer the case!</p>
<p>Linus Torvalds has many times made it very clear that he doesn't care about what goes on in the "Linux world", all he cares about is the kernel development, and on January 6, 2020 in the "Moderated Discussions" forum at <a href="https://www.realworldtech.com/forum/?threadid=189711&amp;curpostid=189841">realworldtech.com</a>, Linus Torvalds answered a user's question, with an absolute jaw-dropping comment, about a year-old kernel maintenance controversy that heavily impacted the ZFS on Linux project.</p>
<p>After answering the user's actual question, Torvalds went on to make very wrong and damaging claims about the ZFS filesystem. Torvalds said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It (ZFS) was always more of a buzzword than anything else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By that statements Linus Torvalds has just reduced more that 15 years of development of one of the most robust and popular filesystems in the world into a "buzzword"!</p>
<p>ZFS is described as "The last word in filesystems". It is a combined filesystem and logical volume manager originally designed by Sun Microsystems. ZFS is a stable, fast, secure, and future-proof filesystem. It is scalable, and includes extensive protection against data corruption, support for high storage capacities, a maximum 16 Exabyte file size, and a maximum 256 Quadrillion Zettabytes storage with no limit on number of filesystems (datasets) or files, efficient data compression, snapshots and copy-on-write clones, continuous integrity checking and automatic repair, RAID-Z, native NFSv4 ACLs, and can be very precisely configured.</p>
<p>The two main implementations, by Oracle and by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenZFS">OpenZFS</a> project, are extremely similar, making ZFS widely available within Unix-like systems.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the Wikipedia article, OpenZFS is an umbrella project aimed at bringing together individuals and companies that use the ZFS file system and work on its improvements, aiming as well at making ZFS more widely used and developed in an open-source manner. OpenZFS brings together developers from the illumos, Linux, FreeBSD, and macOS platforms, and a wide range of companies. High-level goals of the project include raising awareness of the quality, utility and availability of open-source implementations of ZFS, encouraging open communication about ongoing efforts toward improving open-source variants of ZFS, and ensuring consistent reliability, functionality and performance of all distributions of ZFS.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/commits/master">OpenZFS on Linux</a>, which is the Linux part of the project, has currently 345 active contributors with more that 5.600 commits, and commits are being made on an almost daily basis!</p>
<p>Some of the worlds biggest CDN and data storage services runs ZFS on either FreeBSD or Linux!</p>
<p>In another situation Linus Torvalds gave an interview on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mysM-V5h9z8">TFiR: Open Source and Emerging Tech YouTube channel</a> about Linux on the desktop in which he makes another amazing statement saying that Linux still isn't ready for the desktop and that perhaps <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrome_OS">Chrome OS</a> is the solution to that problem.</p>
<p>These and many other statements by Linus Torvalds shows that Torvalds should avoid authoritative statements about projects he's unfamiliar with, but more importantly they also show that Linux as an operating system has no real direction and no clear management because the kernel development is performed in isolation from the rest of the Linux world.</p>
<p>Linus Torvalds is generally very open to the rapid influence by corporate interests and his perspective on security is also worrying.</p>
<p>In 2009 Linus Torvalds admitted that the kernel development is getting out of control.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're getting bloated and huge. Yes, it's a problem ... Uh, I'd love to say we have a plan ... I mean, sometimes it's a bit sad that we are definitely not the streamlined, small, hyper-efficient kernel that I envisioned 15 years ago ... The kernel is huge and bloated, and our icache footprint is scary. I mean, there is no question about that. And whenever we add a new feature, it only gets worse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At LinuxCon 2014, he said that he thinks the bloat situation is better because modern PCs are a lot faster!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've been bloating the kernel over the last 20 years, but hardware has grown faster.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a very problematic attitude.</p>
<p>When software gets bloated it not only becomes more insecure and more error prone, but it also becomes much slower. Thinking that the problem goes away because hardware becomes faster is an immature attitude. In this day and age we need to optimize software so that less power is required, we need to save power and limit pollution.</p>
<p>In a 2007 interview "Why I quit": kernel developer Con Kolivas he stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If there is any one big problem with kernel development and Linux it is the complete disconnection of the development process from normal users. You know, the ones who constitute 99.9% of the Linux user base. The Linux kernel mailing list is the way to communicate with the …</p></blockquote></article></div>

			<p>I have never used WhatsApp, and never will. Despite this, I still feel the need to write an article about WhatsApp since it’s the perfect case study to help understand a class of businesses models I call “user domestication”. The domestication of users is high on my list of problems plaguing the human race, and is worth a detailed explanation.</p>
<p>With the meta-explanation out of the way, let us begin.</p>
<h2 id="whatsapps-rise">WhatsApp’s rise</h2>
<p>For those unfamiliar, WhatsApp is a tool that makes it convenient and easy to help Facebook further its core mission: the optimization and auctioning of human behavior (colloquially known as “targeted advertising”). It originally persuaded people to consent to this by allowing them to send text to each other over the Internet, something that was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_instant_messaging_protocols">already possible</a>, and combining an easy-to-learn UI with successful marketing. It then expanded to include features such as free voice and video calls. Free calls helped it grow to become the de-facto communication platform in many other countries.</p>
<p>Having its own proprietary chat system incompatible with other clients allowed WhatsApp to build a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">network effect</a>: WhatsApp’s existing users were held captive by the fact that leaving WhatsApp meant losing the ability to communicate with WhatsApp users. People switching from WhatsApp must convince all their friends to switch, too; this includes less technically inclined friends who had a hard time learning WhatsApp in the first place.</p>
<p>In a WhatsApp world, people who want to keep in touch must abide by the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone can only use the proprietary WhatsApp client to send messages; developing alternative clients isn’t supported.</li>
<li>Everyone’s mobile device must run an operating system supported by said client. Since WhatsApp developers will only write a client for popular operating systems, the Android and iOS duopoly strengthens.</li>
<li>Users fully depend on WhatsApp developers. If WhatsApp developers decide to include user-hostile features in the app, users must go with it. They can’t switch to a different server or client without switching away from WhatsApp and losing the ability to communicate with all their WhatsApp contacts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="user-domestication">User domestication</h2>
<p>WhatsApp rose by trapping previously-free beings in their corral and changing their habits to create dependence on masters. Over time, this made it difficult or impossible to return to their previous lifestyle. That process should sound familiar: it’s eerily similar to the domestication of animals. I call this type of vendor lock-in <strong>user domestication:</strong> the removal of user autonomy to trap users into serving vendors.</p>
<p>I chose this metaphor because animal domestication is a gradual process that isn’t always deliberate, and typically revolves around one group becoming dependent upon another. For example: there’s evidence that domestication of dogs began with socialization, resulting in not-entirely-artificial selection promoting genes that resulted in more friendliness with and dependence upon humans.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Whether it happens on purpose or by accident, user domestication almost always follows the same three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>A high level of dependence given from users to a software vendor</li>
<li>An inability for users to control their software, through at least one of the following methods:
<ol>
<li>Preventing modification of the software</li>
<li>Preventing migration onto a different platform</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The exploitation of now-captive users who are unable to resist</li>
</ol>
<p>The completion of the first two steps left WhatsApp users vulnerable to user domestication. With investors to answer to, they had every incentive to implement user-hostile features without consequence.</p>
<p>So, of course, they did.</p>
<h2 id="whatsapps-descent">WhatsApp’s descent</h2>
<p>Domestication has a purpose: it enables a master species to exploit the domesticated species for its own gain.</p>
<p>Recently, WhatsApp updated its privacy policy to allow sharing data with its parent, Facebook. Users who agreed to use WhatsApp under its previous privacy policy had two options: agree to the new policy or be unable to use WhatsApp again. The WhatsApp privacy policy update is a classic bait-and-switch: WhatsApp lured users in with a sleek interface and the impression of privacy, domesticated them to remove their autonomy to migrate, and then backtracked on its previous commitment to privacy with minimal consequence. Each step in this process enabled the next; had user domestication not taken place, it would be easy for most users to switch away with minimal friction.</p>
<p>Those of us who were sounding the alarm a few years ago experienced a brief moment of sadistic bliss when our titles were upgraded from “annoying and paranoid conspiracy theorists” to just “annoying”.</p>
<h3 id="an-attempt-at-damage-control">An attempt at damage control</h3>
<p>The bait-and-switch operation incurred backlash significant enough for a noticeable minority of users to actually migrate; this number turned out to be slightly more than the rounding error WhatsApp was likely expecting. In response, WhatsApp delayed the change and published the following ad:</p>

	<img width="600" src="https://seirdy.one/p/whatsapp_ad.png" alt="WhatsApp ad describing data not collected">
</picture>

<p>The ad lists various data that WhatsApp doesn’t collect or share. Allaying data collection concerns by listing data <em>not</em> collected is misleading. WhatsApp doesn’t collect hair samples or retinal scans either; not collecting that information doesn’t mean it respects privacy because it doesn’t change the information WhatsApp <em>does</em> collect.</p>
<p>The ad denies “keep[ing] logs of who everyone is messaging or calling”. Collecting data is not the same as “keeping logs”; it’s possible for metadata to be fed into an algorithm before being discarded. A model can thus learn that two users call each other frequently without keeping logs of the metadata for each call. The fact that they specifically chose to phrase this line around logging implies that WhatsApp either already collects this class of data or has deliberately left the door open to collecting it in the future.</p>
<p>A stroll through WhatsApp’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210124061525/https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/privacy-policy/?lang=en">actual privacy policy</a> at the time reveals that they do collect considerable metadata used for marketing through Facebook.</p>
<h2 id="software-freedom">Software freedom</h2>
<p>With user domestication, providing useful software to users is a means to the end of exploiting them. The alternative is simple: make serving users the end in and of itself.</p>
<p>To prevent being controlled by software, users must be in control. Software that allows users to be in control is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">free software</a>. The word “free” in this context refers to freedom rather than price. Software freedom is similar to the concept of open-source, but the latter is focused on practical benefits rather than ethics. A less ambiguous term that neutrally refers to both free and open-source software is <strong><abbr title="free and open-source software">FOSS</abbr></strong>.</p>
<p>Others have <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">explained</a> the concepts underpinning free software better than I can, so I won’t go into detail. It comes down to four essential freedoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose</li>
<li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish</li>
<li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others</li>
<li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="making-money-with-foss">Making money with FOSS</h3>
<p>The most common objection I hear is that FOSS makes it harder to make money.</p>
<p>The key to making money with FOSS is to make software a <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Complement">commoditized complement</a> of other, more profitable services. Examples of such services include selling support, customization, consulting, training, managed hosting, hardware, and certifications. Plenty of companies use this approach instead of building proprietary software: Red Hat, Collabora, System76, Purism, Canonical, SUSE, Hashicorp, Databricks, and Gradle are some names that come to mind.</p>
<p>Managed hosting isn’t a basket worth all your eggs if giants like AWS can do the same at a lower price. Being the developer can give an edge in areas like customization, support, and training; it doesn’t offer as obvious an advantage when it comes to hosting.</p>
<h2 id="foss-isnt-always-enough">FOSS isn’t always enough</h2>
<p>Free software is a necessary but sometimes insufficient requirement to build domestication immunity. Two more measures include <strong>simplicity</strong> and <strong>open platforms.</strong></p>
<h3 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h3>
<p>When software grows too complex, it needs to be maintained by a large team. Users who disagree with a vendor can’t easily fork and maintain a multi-million-line codebase, especially if the software in question potentially contains security vulnerabilities. Dependence on the vendor can grow quite problematic when complexity causes development costs to skyrocket; the vendor might resort to implementing user-hostile features to stay afloat.</p>
<p>Complex software that can’t be developed by a different group of people creates dependence, step one of user domestication. That alone is enough to open the door to problematic developments.</p>
<h4 id="case-study-mozilla-and-the-web">Case study: Mozilla and the Web</h4>
<p>Mozilla was a ray of hope in the browser wars, a space dominated by adtech, surveillance, and vendor lock-in. Unfortunately, developing a browser engine is a monumental task difficult enough for Opera and Microsoft to give up and re-skin Chromium. Browsers are more than the document readers they were meant to be: they’ve evolved into application runtimes with their own stacks for GPU acceleration, Bluetooth, permissions, device enumeration, bundled media codecs, <abbr title="digital rights management">DRM</abbr><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, extension APIs, developer tools…the list goes on. It takes billions of dollars a year to respond to vulnerabilities in such a massive attack surface and keep up with a standard that grows at such a worrying rate. Those billions have to come from somewhere.</p>
<p>Mozilla ended up having to make major compromises to stay afloat. It cut search deals with blatantly user-hostile companies, and bundled the browser with <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/advancingcontent/2014/02/11/publisher-transformation-with-users-at-the-center/">ads</a> and bloatware such as a partially ad-funded proprietary bookmarking SaaS called <a href="https://dustri.org/b/firefox-youre-supposed-to-be-in-my-pocket-not-the-other-way-around.html">Pocket</a>. Since acquiring Pocket (to diversify its sources of income), Mozilla hasn’t yet delivered on its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/27/mozilla-pockets-pocket-in-first-acquisition/">earlier statements</a> saying it would open-source its code: while the clients have been open-sourced, the server code remains proprietary. Open-sourcing this and re-writing portions if necessary …</p></section></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			<!-- Article Start -->
			
<p>In May 2020, former president Donald Trump wrote on Twitter and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/01/facebook-staff-angry--zuckerberg.html">Facebook</a>, “When the looting starts, the shooting starts,” encouraging the use of lethal force against Black Lives Matter protesters. Mark Zuckerberg, in communicating with his staff about why he decided not to take down the post, compared it with a statement the company removed from its platform earlier that year in India.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kapil Mishra, a Delhi politician from the governing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, had given the Delhi police <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/kapil-mishra-delhi-police-caa-protests-jaffrabad-6282870/">an ultimatum</a> a few months earlier on Twitter and Facebook. If the police didn’t clear the streets of protesters demanding a withdrawal of a discriminatory citizenship law, read the now deleted post, Mishra and his supporters would get out there and do it themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And he wasn’t alone. Other members of India’s Parliament, such as junior finance minister Anurag Thakur, were <a href="https://fb.watch/3975ctWeM7/">caught</a> on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDQYanaVApE">tape</a> at an election rally in Delhi, urging their supporters to “pump bullets” into “traitors.” When questioned by the media, Thakur suggested that they merely reflected the mood of the public in Delhi.</p>



<p>In the days after Mishra’s statements, mobs of BJP supporters carrying firearms, iron rods, and petrol bombs began attacking Muslim neighbourhoods, killing <a href="https://thewire.in/communalism/delhi-riots-kapil-mishra-minority-commission-report">53 people</a> and injuring another 250 in the heart of India’s capital. The Delhi government’s <a href="https://ia801906.us.archive.org/11/items/dmc-delhi-riot-fact-report-2020/-Delhi-riots-Fact-Finding-2020.pdf">fact-finding commission</a>, headed by an advocate of the Supreme Court, couldn’t have been clearer about what happened: “An incendiary public speech by BJP leader and former MLA Kapil Mishra on 23 February 2020 clearly incited violence in words and intent,” the report read.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet politicians like Kapil Mishra, <a href="https://twitter.com/ianuragthakur?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Anurag Thakur</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/p_sahibsingh?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Parvesh Verma </a>— all implicated in the government’s report — still have their Facebook and Twitter accounts, where they can spread their anti-Muslim message to their combined hundreds of thousands of followers. One post was removed, but their accounts remain. The social media platforms did nothing to block or limit their ability to make similar violent threats in the future or publicize policies that subscribe to Hindutva, an explicitly Hindu-supremacist ideology, despite India’s secular constitution. If these companies can silence a sitting United States President — the world’s most powerful official — why can’t they curb politicians with far less power, like Kapil Mishra?</p>



<p>There’s an obviously cynical conclusion to make: Donald Trump has lost his political power, while Kapil Mishra is only gaining his. The way that Facebook and Twitter have treated these two politicians highlights the fact that the platforms exist to protect the powerful and their own profits over everything else.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Populists don’t gain power in a vacuum. They build it using all the advantages that social media gives those who are not constrained by facts and are willing to make open calls for violence. The problem is not freedom of speech— that is sacrosanct. The problem is that, in the pursuit of profit, social media giants will amplify incendiary voices, giving them the freedom to reach more followers. It’s a systemic risk that governments need to tackle with emerging legislation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Social media algorithms are the automated editors that decide what you see in your feeds. They are built on massive volumes of data that platforms extract by surveilling everything their users do online. These algorithms are built to maximize our attention and keep us clicking and scrolling so that people can be shown more ads. This addictive design has not been programmed to discern what is true or what is false, what is harmful or what is not.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>While the most stringent regulations are currently in places like California and the European Union, the worst harm is happening far away from the West.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>My organization, <a href="https://www.reset.tech/">Reset</a>, was built to tackle these flaws at the heart of how social media is built. We advocate for stronger enforcement of rules and standards that can severely curtail the amplification of disinformation and hate. And we want to ensure that voices from the “rest of the world” are not lost in regulatory discussions of systemic risk. While the most stringent regulations are currently in places like California and the European Union, the worst harm is happening far away from the West.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In India, staff at Facebook can’t and don’t want to challenge political power that produces industrial quantities of hate and disinformation on their platform. In 2019, I was very surprised to find Facebook’s team in India asleep at the wheel ahead of a major “citizenship” counting exercise that <a href="https://www.fidh.org/en/region/asia/india/assam-the-biggest-mass-disenfranchisement-of-the-21stcentury">could disenfranchise</a> hundreds of thousands of genuine Indian citizens in the eastern state of Assam.</p>



<p>The government, with the help of the media, painted Muslim Bengalis in Assam as immigrants from Bangladesh. India’s home minister called them “<a href="https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha-2019/infiltrators-are-termites-will-throw-them-out-amit-shah/article26805646.ece">termites</a>” and threatened to throw them out of the country. Despite <a href="https://avaazpress.s3.amazonaws.com/FINAL-Facebook%20in%20Assam_Megaphone%20for%20hate%20-%20Compressed%20(1).pdf">strong parallels</a> to how Rohingya Muslims were disenfranchised in Myanmar and Facebook’s disastrous role in fanning the flames of genocidal violence there, the company hadn’t seemed to have learned any lessons. It had no plan in place to tackle the huge spike in hate speech and lies that accompanied the citizenship exercise, because they had barely any content moderators who could read and write in the Assamese language.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/07/facebook-does-not-benefit-from-hate/">Public statements</a> by Facebook claimed that what people say and do on its site is merely a mirror of society. If Donald Trump incites a whole movement of white supremacists, it is because white supremacy exists in American society, or Hindu supremacy exists in Indian society, as demonstrated by members of India’s own democratically elected parliament. There is, of course, some truth to that, and traditional media has also helped fan the flames of hatred.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the “passive mirror” defense lodged by major social media companies is one of their greatest lies. Facebook’s own research in Germany showed that 64% of people who joined an extremist group did so because of Facebook’s recommendation tools (the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/facebook-group-recommendations-election/">later paused the feature</a>).&nbsp;In 2014, a former Facebook product manager <a href="http://andrewledvina.com/blog/2014-07-04-10-ways-facebook-is-the-devil/">wrote</a> that Facebook carries out experiments on users all the time — to make them click the like button, click on more ads, and spend more time on the site.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The violent events in Washington on January 6 played out under the full glare of the global press, forcing platforms to enforce their own policies on inciting violence. But in the U.S. as well as around the world, social media is still enabling the rise of more Donald Trumps, like Kapil Mishra or Anurag Thakur in India. It won’t stop unless we hit “reset” on Big Tech.</p>

        <p>Rust functions are surprisingly diverse, sitting at the intersection of multiple
language features which may take time to understand. In this post, we’ll walk through
those features and explain how they appear in function signatures, so you can be
well-equipped to understand functions you see in the wild, or identify the best way
to write the functions you need in your own code.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="table-of-contents">Table of Contents</h2>



<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<div id="info-1">
    
    <div>
        <div>
            
<h3 id="describing-not-recommending">Describing, not Recommending</h3>

<p>This is a survey of what function signatures <em>can</em> look like in Rust, not a commentary
on what they <em>should</em> look like. Any one of the patterns shown here may be seen in the wild,
and learning to read other people’s code in any language is a valuable skill.</p>

<h3 id="part-of-a-series">Part of a Series</h3>

<p>This is the first of a pair of posts describing how to read Rust function signatures. Part 2,
tackling generic functions, is currently in the works.</p>

        </div>
    </div>
</div>


<h2 id="signatures">Signatures</h2>

<p>First things first, we need a function signature. Let’s start with something basic.</p>

<figure id="code-1">
    <a href="#skip-code-1">Skip this content.</a>
    
<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>example_1</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>i32</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>i32</span><span>;</span>
<span>//           ↑  ↑    ↑  ↑       ↑</span>
<span>//           |  |    |  |       |</span>
<span>//           | type  | type    type</span>
<span>//         pattern  pattern</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

    <figcaption><span>Code 1</span> <p>A simple function signature example.</p> <a href="#code-1"><span>↺</span></a></figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>This is a function that takes in two 32-bit integers (the <code>i32</code> type), and
returns a 32-bit integer as well. The arrow (<code>-&gt;</code>) indicates the return type.</p>

<p>Note that the types are all explicit. Rust <em>does</em> support type inference, but not for
function signatures. All parameter and return types must be specified.</p>



<p>We can also see that the pattern comes before the type, separated by a colon. This
<code>&lt;pattern&gt;: &lt;type&gt;</code> syntax matches Rust’s general syntax for
<dfn id="def-type-ascription">type ascription</dfn>, which is the Rust term for
specifying types explicitly.</p>

<h2 id="destructuring">Destructuring</h2>

<p>Notice too that I keep saying “pattern” instead of “variable name.” That’s because Rust
parameters are <dfn id="def-pattern" title="pattern">patterns</dfn>, meaning you can
destructure and bind against the internal structure of the types.</p>

<figure id="code-2">
    <a href="#skip-code-2">Skip this content.</a>
    
<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>IpV4Address</span><span>(</span><span>u8</span><span>,</span> <span>u8</span><span>,</span> <span>u8</span><span>,</span> <span>u8</span><span>);</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>print_ipv4addr</span><span>(</span><span>IpV4Address</span><span>(</span><span>o1</span><span>,</span> <span>o2</span><span>,</span> <span>o3</span><span>,</span> <span>o4</span><span>):</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>IpV4Address</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}.{}.{}.{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>o1</span><span>,</span> <span>o2</span><span>,</span> <span>o3</span><span>,</span> <span>o4</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>addr</span> <span>=</span> <span>IpV4Address</span><span>(</span><span>127</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>
    <span>print_ipv4addr</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>addr</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

    <figcaption><span>Code 2</span> <p>An example of a function with destructuring in its parameter list.</p> <a href="#code-2"><span>↺</span></a></figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>In this example, the <code>IpV4Address</code> type is destructured in the function signature, binding four
variables (<code>o1</code>, <code>o2</code>, <code>o3</code>, and <code>o4</code>) to the respective items in the tuple struct. These
variables are then used in the function body to print the address.</p>

<h3 id="refutability">Refutability</h3>

<p>One restriction of pattern matching in function signatures is that you can only use
<dfn id="dfn-irrefutable">irrefutable</dfn> patterns, meaning <em>patterns that always match</em>.
By contrast, <dfn id="dfn-refutable">refutable</dfn> patterns may sometimes fail to match,
perhaps because they specify only a single variant of an <code>enum</code> with multiple variants.
Refutable patterns can be used in a <code>match</code> expression or equivalent construct, where the
collection of patterns is checked for exhaustiveness (meaning all values are guaranteed to
match at least pattern), but patterns in function signatures are all alone, so they must
be irrefutable.</p>



<p>Here’s a table to help explain:</p>

<figure id="table-1">
    <a href="#skip-table-1">Skip this content.</a>
    <figcaption><span>Table 1</span> <p>A survey of pattern refutability.</p> <a href="#table-1"><span>↺</span></a></figcaption>
    
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Pattern</th>
      <th>Refutability</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>a</code></td>
      <td>Irrefutable</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>_</code></td>
      <td>Irrefutable</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>MyStruct { f1: x, f2: y }</code></td>
      <td>Irrefutable</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Some(b)</code></td>
      <td>Refutable</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Err(MyError::Foo)</code></td>
      <td>Refutable</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


    
</figure>

<p>The first three patterns could be found in a function signature. The last two could not.</p>

<h3 id="renaming">Renaming</h3>

<p>Another feature of declaring and assigning to new variables in a function
signature pattern is that you can create a variable with a name different from the
name of the field in the relevant type.</p>

<figure id="code-3">
    <a href="#skip-code-3">Skip this content.</a>
    
<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Something</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>field_1</span><span>:</span> <span>i32</span><span>,</span>
    <span>field_2</span><span>:</span> <span>f64</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// The `field_1: x` and `field_2: y` parts are assigning</span>
<span>// the values of `field_1` to `x` and `field_2` to `y`.</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>Something</span> <span>{</span> <span>field_1</span><span>:</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>field_2</span><span>:</span> <span>y</span> <span>}:</span> <span>Something</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"x: {}, y: {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>Something</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>field_1</span><span>:</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span>
        <span>field_2</span><span>:</span> <span>1.0</span><span>,</span>
    <span>};</span>
    
    <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

    <figcaption><span>Code 3</span> <p>An example of renaming.</p> <a href="#code-3"><span>↺</span></a></figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>This can be useful when you want to locally use a different name than the name of
the field, and do so in a single line rather than binding to a local variable
with a new name in the body of the function.</p>

<h2 id="bindings">Bindings</h2>

<p>As we use patterns to bind, we can also set the kind of binding, which may be the
default (with no specifier) <code>mut</code>, <code>ref</code>, or <code>ref mut</code>. Collectively, the binding
options are as follows:</p>

<figure id="table-2">
    <a href="#skip-table-2">Skip this content.</a>
    <figcaption><span>Table 2</span> <p>Binding syntax and the resulting types</p> <a href="#table-2"><span>↺</span></a></figcaption>
    
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Binding Specifier</th>
      <th>Mutability</th>
      <th>Ownership</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>No specifier</td>
      <td>Immutable</td>
      <td>Owned</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>mut</code></td>
      <td>Mutable</td>
      <td>Owned</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>ref</code></td>
      <td>Immutable</td>
      <td>Borrowed</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>ref mut</code></td>
      <td>Mutable</td>
      <td>Borrowed</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


    
</figure>

<p>The <dfn id="dfn-binding">binding</dfn> pattern specifies how a binding should occur; should it be
by-value (meaning in Rust that it either takes ownership of the bound value, or makes a copy of it,
depending on whether the type of that value implements the <code>Copy</code> trait), by-reference, or
by-mutable-reference?</p>

<h3 id="owning-binding">Owning Binding</h3>

<p>An owning binding may display one of two behaviors, depending on the type involved in the binding.
If the type implements the <code>Copy</code> trait, then it will be copied to the new owner at the binding site.
If the type <em>does not</em> implement <code>Copy</code>, then it will be moved from the prior owner to the new owner
at the binding site.</p>



<p>To understand this, let’s talk about <code>Copy</code>. <code>Copy</code> is a trait indicating a type is “trivially copyable,”
meaning it can be copied with only a call to <code>memcpy</code>, so all the data contained in the structure
is contiguous; there are no pointers to chase. <code>Copy</code> tells us that copying a piece of data is fast.</p>

<p>At the same time, it improves ergonomics for certain types which may otherwise be tedious to use under
Rust’s ownership semantics. Imagine if number types (which all implement <code>Copy</code>) were moved any time
they were assigned. Something as simple as <code>x = y</code> would invalidate <code>y</code>, and thus make mathematical code
much more frustrating to write.</p>

<p>So, <code>Copy</code> pulls double-duty. It tells us something is cheap to copy, and it permits that copying to be
done implicitly.</p>

<p>In contexts where a type doesn’t implement <code>Copy</code> but <em>does</em> implement the <code>Clone</code> trait, you can instead
call <code>.clone()</code> on it explicitly to create a duplicate which will be moved into the new owner, without
invalidating the prior owner.</p>

<p>Now, what does this look like in the context of a binding?</p>

<figure id="code-3">
    <a href="#skip-code-3">Skip this content.</a>
    
<div><div><pre><code><span>#[derive(Clone,</span> <span>Debug)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Thing</span><span>;</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>t</span> <span>=</span> <span>Thing</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// This moves `t` into the `takes_ownership` function.</span>
    <span>// `t` no longer owns any data, and thus is invalid</span>
    <span>// to use again.</span>
    <span>takes_ownership</span><span>(</span><span>t</span><span>);</span>

    <span>// If uncommented, this line would not compile.</span>
    <span>//</span>
    <span>// println!("{:#?}", t);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>takes_ownership</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>Thing</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// `x` is the owner of whatever `Thing` is passed</span>
    <span>// into the `takes_ownership` function, and when</span>
    <span>// `x` goes out of scope at the end of the function,</span>
    <span>// any necessary cleanup of the data will be</span>
    <span>// performed (only relevant if the type in question</span>
    <span>// implements `Drop`).</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

    <figcaption><span>Code 3</span> <p>An example of a broken use of owning binding in a function signature.</p> <a href="#code-3"><span>↺</span></a></figcaption>
    
</figure>



<p>Sometimes this kind of binding is exactly what you want. For example, you may have a need for a
“consuming builder,” one of two forms the Builder Pattern can take in Rust. In a consuming builder,
the builder type passes ownership of some data to the type that it’s building, because that type
will need ownership of the data to operate.</p>

<p>If you take ownership of a piece of data with an owning binding and want to return ownership to the
calling context, you can return it from the function. For example, the popular <code>once_cell</code> crate features
a type which can only be written to once. If you try to write to it again, it returns ownership of the
value you attempted to set.</p>

<h3 id="mutable-owning-binding">Mutable Owning Binding</h3>

<p>Sometimes, in addition to taking ownership of a piece of data, you’d like for that data to be mutable
from the start as well. In that case, you can use a mutable owning binding.</p>

<p>The use of a mutable owning binding can always be replaced with an immutable owning binding followed by
a mutable rebinding to a variable of the same name in the body of the function (shadowing the parameter
from that line onward). The choice is one of taste.</p>

<h3 id="reference-binding">Reference Binding</h3>

<p>Reference bindings inside function signatures in Rust can seem a little unusual, but they are permitted.
The idea is that the binding performed is a reference to the type of the value. If the value was passed
in by value, then it’s either moved or copied as discussed in the owning binding section, and in the body
of the function the value is of a reference to the post-move data (if the type is <code>Copy</code>, the difference
doesn’t amount to much). This is different from an owning binding of a reference type both for the caller
of the function, and inside the function itself (<code>x: &amp;Number</code> is <em>not</em> the same as <code>ref x: Number</code>).</p>

No server needed, either!</li><li>Combine them for a serverless web app with persistent data, written entirely in Python!</li></ol><h2 id="table-of-contents">Table of Contents</h2><ul><li>Intro: What is Firestore, and why should we use it?</li><li>Part 1: A simple Streamlit Sharing app</li><li>Part 2: Setting up Firestore</li><li>[Coming soon] Part 3: Building the Reddit home page</li><li>[Coming soon] Part 4: Tips and tricks for app development</li></ul><h2 id="intro-what-is-firestore-and-why-should-we-use-it">Intro: What is Firestore, and why should we use it?</h2><p>So what even is this Firestore thing? Well, from <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore">their website</a>:</p><blockquote>Cloud Firestore is a flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server development...</blockquote><p>Let's break that down! First, Firestore is a <em>database</em> - that means it's a good place to store data, and retrieve it later. If you're into ML/data science, and have been building dashboards with Streamlit, the data you work with probably looks like Pandas tables, Numpy arrays, CSV files. These tend to be fairly <em>static</em>. You'll rarely need to create new entries or update them, let alone make your data accessible from apps all over the world. But many web apps need to be <em>dynamic,</em> allowing lots of edits to the data and creation of new data — and databases excel at this! Every consumer web app you can think of (Gmail, Youtube, Slack, Airbnb) have databases that manage the things that their users create (emails, videos, chat messages, and listings).</p><p>Unlike other databases, Firestore is <em>flexible</em>. In technical terms, we call it a "NoSQL" database, which means that you don't have to design a fixed schema for how your data will be structured before you begin. This is great for quick prototyping! Oftentimes, when I'm making a web app, I don't exactly know what it will look like or do, much less how I should store my data.</p><figure><img src="https://geekandpoke.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341d3df553ef0148c80ac6ef970c-pi" alt=""><figcaption>Source: https://geekandpoke.typepad.com/geekandpoke/2011/01/nosql.html</figcaption></figure><p>As an analogy, let's say I wanted to bake a bunch of desserts. A SQL database is a bit like having to write out a pie recipe beforehand, and then always following it line-by-line. I can efficiently bake lots of pies, which will be tasty if my original recipe was good. But the NoSQL approach is more like: let me start with something vaguely pie-like, but maybe it'll become a tart, or drift towards more of a cupcake... I can experiment until I land on something that really hits the spot.</p><p>Finally, Firestore is hosted on the <em>cloud</em>. This means that it's a service, very much like <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> or our very own <a href="http://streamlit.io/sharing">Streamlit Sharing</a>, where you don't have to worry about maintaining your own servers. You don't need to worry about scaling, uptime, or a bunch of other issues that can get in the way of building out your idea.</p><h3 id="what-are-some-downsides-of-firestore">What are some downsides of Firestore?</h3><p>First, as a hosted service, Firestore can cost you money. They do have a generous free tier to start out with — no credit card needed! And if your app exceeds the free limits, they'll inform you and stop new writes. Even if you hit the paid tier, Firestore is pretty cheap; I run a <a href="https://oneword.games/">side project</a> with hundreds of daily users and thousands of daily writes, and Firestore only costs me ~$1/month.</p><p>Second, other databases may perform better on complicated queries, or when you get to e.g. millions of daily users. For pure speed of setup, Firestore is great, but if you already know that scaling will be an issue, you may want to consider other options like <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html">SQLite</a>, <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a>, or <a href="https://cloud.google.com/spanner">Cloud Spanner</a>.</p><p>And finally, most Firestore users use JavaScript, so there are fewer Python code snippets and Stack Overflow answers to find. For this tutorial, we'll use <a href="https://googleapis.dev/python/firestore/latest/index.html">Firestore's Python library</a>, which is very pleasant to work with. Here's a snippet from their Python API for inspiration:</p><pre><code>from google.cloud import firestore

# Add a new user to the database
db = firestore.Client()
doc_ref = db.collection('users').document('alovelace')
doc_ref.set({
    'first': 'Ada',
    'last': 'Lovelace',
    'born': 1815
})

# Then query to list all users
users_ref = db.collection('users')

for doc in users_ref.stream():
    print('{} =&gt; {}'.format(doc.id, doc.to_dict()))
</code></pre><p>Pretty easy to read, right?</p><h2 id="part-1-a-simple-streamlit-sharing-app">Part 1: A simple Streamlit Sharing app</h2><p>Okay! If you're sold on the awesomeness of Firestore, I'm now going to show you how to bake in that awesomeness into a Streamlit app. Let's cook up a simple version of the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/">Reddit home page</a>, from scratch! (Okay, that was the last cooking analogy, I promise.)</p><p>Once again, <a href="https://www.streamlit.io/">Streamlit</a> is the fastest way to build web apps in Python. <a href="https://blog.streamlit.io/introducing-streamlit-sharing/">Streamlit Sharing</a> is the fastest way to put your app online, so you can share it with the world. Here's what Sharing can do for you, in 1 minute:</p><figure><iframe width="356" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/czWaLgF9sA0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Here in Part 1, I'm going to walk you step-by-step through the process of building a Streamlit Sharing app, even if you've never done it before. Ready? Let's do this!</p><p><em>If you're already a Streamlit master, feel free to skip down to Part 2; just remember to <code>pip install google-cloud-firestore</code> , or the equivalent in your Python library manager of choice.</em></p><h3 id="setting-up-your-git-repo">Setting up your Git repo</h3><p>We'll start by <a href="https://github.com/new">creating a new repo on GitHub</a> — the folder where all your code will go. Name it whatever you like! (I'm calling mine <code>streamlit-reddit</code>). Make sure it's public, though, so we can host it on Streamlit Sharing later.</p><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vpwzgFv.png" alt="https://i.imgur.com/vpwzgFv.png"><figcaption>New GitHub repo</figcaption></figure><p>Next, you'll want to download (aka "clone") this repo on your own computer. (<a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">You'll need to have Git installed</a>.) Open up a local shell, and run the following commands, replacing <code>{username}</code> with your own GitHub username:</p><pre><code># Creates a copy of this repo on your computer
$ git clone https://github.com/{username}/streamlit-reddit.git

# Enters the repo, which is currently empty
$ cd streamlit-reddit
</code></pre><h3 id="running-streamlit-on-your-own-computer">Running Streamlit on your own computer</h3><p>With our Git repo set up, let's add in the two main files every Streamlit Sharing app needs:</p><p><code>requirements.txt</code> — A list of the Python libraries we use, so Streamlit Sharing will know to install them.</p><p>For this tutorial, we'll only be using two libraries: Streamlit itself, and the <a href="https://googleapis.dev/python/firestore/latest/index.html">Python client for Firestore</a>. So this is all you need inside your <code>requirements.txt</code> file:</p><pre><code>streamlit
google-cloud-firestore
</code></pre><p><code>streamlit_app.py</code> — Where our app code will go! Let's start with just a few lines:</p><pre><code>import streamlit as st

st.header('Hello 🌎!')
if st.button('Balloons?'):
    st.balloons()
</code></pre><p>This app imports the Streamlit library, and then shows some text and a button. When you click on the button, a bunch of balloons will float up from the bottom of the screen!</p><p>Now, we're going to use <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/">Pip</a> to install the Streamlit and the Firestore libraries onto your own computer. (If you prefer <a href="https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basics.html">pipenv</a> or <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">poetry</a> or <a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/">conda</a>, any of those are fine too!)</p><pre><code># Install all the libraries mentioned in requirements.txt
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
...
</code></pre><p>We're ready to run our starter Streamlit app!</p><pre><code># Run this Streamlit app on your own computer
$ streamlit run streamlit_app.py
You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

  Local URL: http://localhost:8501
  Network URL: http://192.168.1.3:8501
</code></pre><p>If you see the Streamlit app launched on your own browser, that means everything worked. (You may have to enter in the URL, like <a href="http://localhost:8501/">http://localhost:8501</a>). Try clicking on that button!</p><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/c6YSDvk.png" alt="https://i.imgur.com/c6YSDvk.png"><figcaption>Streamlit app running locally</figcaption></figure><h3 id="deploying-your-app-on-streamlit-sharing">Deploying your app on Streamlit Sharing</h3><p>Okay, we're ready to put our app on Streamlit Sharing! First, we need to save our changes to Git (aka "commit"), and then upload (aka "push") our changes onto GitHub. Again, from a shell that's inside your repo:</p><pre><code># Add and all changes in your files
$ git commit -am "Create requirements.txt and a simple Streamlit app"

# Push all commits back to GitHub
$ git push
</code></pre><p>Now if you go to the GitHub page for your repo, you should see the code that you just wrote:</p><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HhxVgnQ.png" alt="https://i.imgur.com/HhxVgnQ.png"><figcaption>Successfully pushed code</figcaption></figure><p>Once your code is on GitHub, you're ready to deploy your app for the world to see! Head over to <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/">https://share.streamlit.io/</a> and create a new app. (If you don't have access to Sharing yet, post below in the comments and we'll sort you out.) <a href="https://blog.streamlit.io/deploying-streamlit-apps-using-streamlit-sharing/">Here's a great tutorial</a> on deploying through sharing if you'd like to read more.</p><p>Fill in the name of your repo — the others should populate automagically — then click "Deploy!" 🎈</p><figure><img src="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2021/01/GIF_1.2.gif" alt=""><figcaption>Steps to deploying an app on sharing</figcaption></figure><p>That URL you are on (e.g. <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/akrolsmir/streamlit-reddit">https://share.streamlit.io/akrolsmir/streamlit-reddit</a>), is one that anyone on Earth can go to and play with. Isn't that cool? You've gone from "literally nothing" to "functioning, globally-hosted Streamlit app" in the space of 15 minutes! But hold on to your horses, we're about to get to the <em>really</em> cool stuff: saving data online, with Firestore.</p><h2 id="part-2-setting-up-firestore">Part 2: Setting up Firestore</h2><p>Once again, Firestore is the database we're using to create, edit, and read our data. For our Reddit home page, we're going to use it to store things like the links, titles, and later upvotes. Here in Part 2, I'll walk you through how to set that up.</p><h3 id="set-up-a-firebase-account">Set up a Firebase account</h3><p>To clear up some potential confusion: <em>Firestore</em> is the database we're using, one of many services provided by <em>Firebase</em> (which is a part of Google). You'll want to sign in to your Google account at <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/">https://console.firebase.google.com/</a>. Then, create a Firebase project:</p><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/h3PS1m6.png" alt="https://i.imgur.com/h3PS1m6.png"><figcaption>The Firebase sign-up screen</figcaption></figure><p>These are the steps to create an account:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2021/01/GIF_2.2.gif" alt=""></figure><ul><li>Name your project</li><li>Enable analytics [You <em>can</em> skip this since we're not using it today, but I think Analytics are really cool 🙂]</li><li>Accept terms and click create!</li></ul><p>Once created, you'll see Firebase loading and will be notified when the project is ready [this is pretty quick].</p><figure><img src="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2021/01/GIF_3.2.gif" alt=""></figure><p>Awesome, our Firebase project is set up! Firebase has a lot of different tools for building web apps, but the only one we're using today is Firestore.

    <div>

      

      <article role="main">
        <p>It all started with a meme tweet:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.acepace.net/images/xlatb/meme.jpg" alt="twitter meme describing waves to extract values from an array in x64"></p>

<p>Laugh, scroll past, then I started wondering, “what are the chances this obscure opcode is faster than optimized loads?” and I realized I had just been <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">nerd sniped</a>. So I decided to dig up my half-remembered memories of how to benchmark opcodes and get to the bottom of this meme.</p>

<p>For those of us who do not recall every opcode that Intel dreamed up, the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-instruction-set-reference-manual-325383.pdf">Intel reference manual</a> is a useful reference and says the following:</p>

<p>XLAT/XLATB - <em>Locates a byte entry in a table in memory, using the contents of the AL register as a table index, then copies the contents of the table entry back into the AL register. The index in the AL register is treated as an unsigned integer. The XLAT and XLATB instructions get the base address of the table in memory from either the DS:EBX or the DS:BX registers</em></p>

<p>In other words, the instruction performs</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nasm"><span>MOV</span> <span>AL</span><span>,[</span><span>EBX</span><span>+</span><span>AL</span><span>]</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>EBX is the array base and AL is the offset.</p>

<p>Which is exactly the core line of the last snippet in the meme.</p>

<p>My guess was <strong>the equivalent load opcode version would outperform xlatb</strong>. How I tested this simple question is worth writing up, if only to have a reference for micro benchmarking from end to end.</p>

<h3 id="technical-background">Technical background</h3>

<p><em>Feel free to skip this if you’re familiar with benchmarking, CISC vs RISC and why I guessed what I guessed</em></p>

<h4 id="benchmarking">Benchmarking</h4>

<p>What I did to test my guess is called micro benchmarking. The difference from regular benchmarking is in the focus and minimization of context. It helps in answering very small questions such as “What is the fastest way to sort an array of numbers in C”, and ignoring memory pressure, design and other considerations that are important in the real world of benchmarking.</p>

<p>The challenge in micro benchmarking is that there is a lot of noise in the process. Compilers, operating systems, CPU temperature and frequency changes can all serve to create large shifts in the performance of the benched code snippet.</p>

<p>Therefore, the goal is to define the problem as accurately as possible. For example</p>

<ul>
  <li>Minimize hardware considerations. This means removing frequency scaling, branching, any chance of the data being evicted from the cache.</li>
  <li>No interaction with the system. This means no system calls, but also no memory allocations and hopefully remove the role the runtime plays (for example if we’re benchmarking .NET code)</li>
</ul>

<p>These typically lead micro benchmarks to being written in assembly code and measuring runtime using the <a href="https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/X86-assembly/Instructions/rdtsc">rdtsc</a> opcode.</p>

<p>To understand this at a basic level, I really recommend the book <a href="https://nostarch.com/insidemachine.htm">Inside the Machine</a> (Jon Stokes), another option is <a href="http://www.lighterra.com/papers/modernmicroprocessors/">Modern Microprocessors in 90 minutes</a> but for more than that, the relatively up to date reference is <a href="https://www.realworldtech.com/cpu/">Real World Technologies</a> articles on CPU architecture.</p>

<p>The reference for nearly everything relating to opcode latency for Intel and AMD CPUs is <a href="https://www.agner.org/optimize/">Agners guides</a> and <a href="https://uops.info/table.html">uops.info</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to measure these latencies and what exactly a CPU is doing when executing an opcode, you need to read the Performance Measurement Counters embedded in the hardware. This gives us precisely numbers for (example) how many L1 cache hits and misses happened in a code block, how many branch mispredictions happened and so forth.</p>

<h4 id="xlat-and-cisc">XLAT and CISC</h4>

<p>Now, what the heck is XLAT and why does it exist?</p>

<p>The basic idea behind the XLAT instruction is the idea behind Complex Instruction Set Computers (CISC), that states hardware should implement common instruction sequences with dedicated instructions that perform the same task but faster. This is the idea behind many of the weird x86 instructions (or other CPUs).</p>

<p>However, since that time, all modern CPUs have turned RISC-like, by internally using a reduced instruction set and translating the ISA opcodes into internal commands, some implemented using CPU microcode. This also allows for different optimizations such as micro opcode fusion. Another note, CPU designers spend a lot of time optimizing the commonly use instructions, which makes them very fast (for example xor rax,rax is free) This leaves very little room for opcodes like xlatb to shine.</p>

<p>While we’re dunking on CISC, I came across the following great snippet on the difference between the good parts of CISC and the bad parts.</p>

<p><em>We should distinguish the “Complex” instructions of CISC CPUs - complicated, rarely used, and universally low performance, from the “Featureful” instructions common to both CISC and RISC CPUs, which combine a small sequence of operations, are commonly used, and high performance. - <a href="https://gist.github.com/erincandescent/8a10eeeea1918ee4f9d9982f7618ef68">erincandescent</a></em></p>

<h3 id="the-experiments">The experiments</h3>

<p>What I ended up doing was running the different code snippets in the Andreas Abel’s micro benchmarking harness, available on <a href="https://github.com/andreas-abel/nanoBench">GitHub</a>. The machine used for execution was a VM running on a Broadwell i7-5500U, Debian 9.9, kernel version 4.9 with the host CPU frequency governor set to disabled (max clock speed all the time).</p>

<p>The executed code snippets were as described in the table below.</p>

<table>

<p>In order to remove as much variance as possible, it’s best to make sure all accesses are kept inside the L1 cache (code and data). For this reason, the following initializations are required</p>

<ul>
  <li>Aim RBX at RSP, making sure the array accessed is inside the L1 data cache</li>
  <li>Set RAX to 0</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, this opcode sequence is small enough to be in the same L1 code cache line so no effort was required there (manually verified).</p>

<p>For this experiment, what matters is the number of cycles required to execute (which is a close approximation of time) and the cycles elapsed (wall time). In addition, I’ll also measure how many loads happened while executing this snippet, by tracking the <a href="https://download.01.org/perfmon/index/haswell.html">MEM_LOAD_UOPS_RETIRED.L1_HIT PMC</a>.</p>

<p>The command line I used when executing the benchmarks was</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">./nanoBench.sh <span>-avg</span> <span>-n_measurements</span> 500 <span>-asm_init</span> <span>"mov rbx, rsp;xor rax,rax;"</span> <span>-asm</span> SNIPPET_HERE <span>-config</span> configs/cfg_Broadwell_common.txt</code></pre></figure>

<p>The results, summarized in a table:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Snippet 0</th>
      <th>Snippet 1</th>
      <th>Snippet 2</th>
      <th>Snippet 3</th>

    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>Core cycles: 7.02</td>

    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>

<p>There are a few things that stand out.</p>

<p>Foremost, xlatb is slower than the equivalent optimized x64 code.</p>

<p>Second, as is generally known, memory loads are the most expensive part of any algorithm, but once the data is in L1, the difference in number of loads doesn’t seem to matter. The xlatb sequence has only one data load yet is slower than the optimized x64 version.</p>

<p>Second, the core cycle count for the xlatb instruction precisely matches the <a href="https://www.agner.org/optimize/instruction_tables.pdf">Agner table</a> (page 229). Good to know our measurements line up with others :)</p>

<p>Last, note that reducing the amount of instructions used does not decrease time required linearly. Why? The number of instructions is not linearly correlated to the actions performed by the processor. A classic example is xor rcx,rcx. This opcode never actually executes. Instead, the CPU just updates a pointer in the register renaming file.</p>

<p>To examine these type of questions, another tool is required - the Intel Architecture Code Analyzer (<a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-architecture-code-analyzer">IACA</a> - unfortunately now deprecated). This tool will look at the machine code and tell you how different Intel CPUs will execute them. Let’s look at one case in particular to see why removing instructions doesn’t always linearly save time. Attached are only the relevant parts of the output, which are the micro-op count.</p>

<p>* - instruction micro-ops not bound to a port</p>

<p>^ - Micro Fusion occurred</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Number of Uops</th>
      <th>opcodes</th>
      <th>Number of Uops</th>
      <th>opcodes</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>3^#</td>
      <td>push rcx</td>
      <td>3^#</td>
      <td>push rcx</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1*</td>
      <td>xor rcx,rcx</td>
      <td>1*</td>
      <td>movzx rcx,al</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>mov cl,al</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>add rcx, rbx</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>add rcx,rbx</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>mov al, byte ptr [rcx]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>mov al, byte ptr [rcx]</td>
      <td>2^#</td>
      <td>pop [rcx]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2^#</td>
      <td>pop rcx</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The important bit is noting that in snippet 0, the opcodes xor rcx,rcx; mov cl,al takes up one execution unit (xor rcx rcx is not bound to an execution port).</p>

<p>In snippet 1, the opcode movzx rcx,al doesn’t take up an execution port at all.</p>

<p>You can also play around with llvm-mca which does something similar, and see the same results, by using Compiler Explorer (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/6SjY_d">snippet link</a>).</p>

<h4 id="side-note-on-actually-running-the-experiments">Side note on actually running the experiments</h4>

<p>All my machines are Windows machines, where accessing the PMCs is not as fun or easy as it is on Linux. The proper reaction should be “so run it inside a VM”, but apparently Hyper-V doesn’t expose PMCs to guests by default and I couldn’t find a way to do it easily.</p>

<p>I ran into every possible frustration while searching for a cheap bare metal cloud machine, including Oracle gating the bare metal instances behind a request form that requires a human being to look at.</p>

<p>In the end, VMWare Workstation exposes PMCs to guests so a friend with power to spare gave me a VM to test.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>The meme is wrong, no surprise. An optimized sequence of x64 instructions beats out a single complex instruction. This isn’t always true (POPCNT as a counter example) but some instructions are legacy for a reason. If LLVM doesn’t output the opcode, it’s probably for the best.</p>

<p>Also this was an opportunity to rediscover micro benchmarking. It’s quite likely I made some measurement mistakes, so if you found any, feel free to contact me.</p>

<h2 id="also-thanks-are-in-order-for-help-in-this-bit-of-fun">Also, thanks are in order for help in this bit of fun</h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/wobel_">@wobel_</a> for providing the VM and therapy while I swore at cloud providers.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/damageboy">@damageboy</a> for generally knowing everything and in this case, for writing a series of blog posts on micro benchmarking .NET instructions available <a href="https://bits.houmus.org/2018-08-18/netcoreapp3.0-instrinsics-in-real-life-pt1">here</a> that pushed me to do this sort of stuff</p>

<p>And again to Andreas Abel for saving me a lot of time with his micro benchmarking harness available on <a href="https://github.com/andreas-abel/nanoBench">GitHub</a></p>

<p><em>TL;DR: Use your access logs to get messages from users - then manually add them to your post front matter. Publish on rebuild.</em></p>
<hr>


<p><strong>Warning: This article will be of interest to a very specific - and very small -group of people.</strong></p>

<p>If you:</p>

<p>a) like extremely hacky solutions to problems;</p>

<p>b) Host a static website with an Apache-based server;</p>

<p>c) Want a comments section, and don’t want to either rely on external service such as Disqus or Comment.io or spin up a yet another self-hosted service to handle comments for you.</p>

<p>You should read on. Otherwise, bugger off. You’re wasting your time here.</p>



<p>Static sites, are by their nature, static. You can’t interact with them really. They exist as a collection of HTML pages in a hierarchy on the root of your server. The attractions of a static site are many - not least security, portability, and speed.</p>

<p>But as a writer or site owner, you crave interaction with your readers. How do you manage it without relying on an external service?</p>

<p>Actually, it’s a piece of piss. A very hacky piece of piss.</p>



<p>Alright. Down towards the bottom of the page, you’ll see a box which says “leave a comment.” or something like that. It’s some basic HTML and javascript which I adapted from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools.</a> I’m not really a coder. I have virtually no experience with javascript and only a little with HTML. It’s included as an include called comments.html on my posts template - because we’re all about imagination here.</p>

<p><img src="https://thecrow.uk/assets/pretty-sure-I-nicked-most-of-this-from-somewhere-else-too.png" alt="pretty-sure-I-nicked-most-of-this-from-somewhere-else-too.png"></p>
<center><h6>It's called borrowing</h6></center>
<p>If you write in the box and click the submit button, your browser will push you to a relative URL based on the text, and prefaced with the string “COMMENT.”</p>

<p>For instance, if you wrote, “your site sucks and I hate you so much. Just go away and die.” you would be redirected to “https://thecrow.uk/COMMENTyour site sucks and I hate you so much. Just go away and die”</p>

<p>Obviously, that URL doesn’t exist, so you’ll be directed to a custom 404 page saying something like: “Thanks for your comment.”</p>

<p>With me so far? Good.</p>

<p>As I said, I’m running an Apache server on a Linux system (Raspbian actually), and I have access logs enabled. Not because I want to track you across the internet, but because it has historically been useful in sniffing out bots (suspiciously absent since ditching WordPress) and bad actors.</p>

<p>Using grep, I can find any entries in my logs which contain the string “COMMENT”</p>

<p>eg: grep COMMENT /thecrow.log</p>

<p>Will bring up the plain text comment along with date &amp; referring URL.</p>



<p>OK. So I have the comment. Everyone hates me and thinks I’m a dick (they are correct), and I want to share their disdain with the world.</p>

<p>On the yaml front matter I have an array called  “article_comments” Comments which I have found in my access logs are manually added to the array. Consider it as a kind of moderation queue. It’s not quite as easy as clicking ‘approve’ on WordPress - but it works.</p>

<p>I also have an _includes called submitted_comments.html which contains the following:</p>

<p><img src="https://thecrow.uk/assets/jekyl-submitted-comments-loop.jpg" alt="assets/jekyl-submitted-comments-loop.jpg"></p>



<p>I can have a script called by cron at 11.59pm every day (just before logs are archived), which will echo the output to a text file - I can then inspect this this text file at my leisure - kind of like a ready-made, automated moderation queue.</p>

<p>I don’t doubt that there will be some unforeseen problem with this, but I can’t think of any right now.</p>



<p>If you’ve understood what I’ve written so far, well done! This has been a mess from start to finish.</p>

<p>But you know what? It works. Leave a comment and try to keep it to under 230 characters.</p>

<p>Happy new year :)</p>

<p>*edit 31/12/2020: For the purpose of this post, I’m approving everything which comes in. But if you could write in complete sentences, that would be nice. Shit gets tedious real fast.</p>

In any case, well done.That reminds me: years ago, when I subscribed to writer Warren Elli's' newsletter, he mentioned that he'd find the oddest items in his search logs, like 'sonicboomkake' and the like.

                 [26/Jan/2021:07:29:53] After getting the 404 page, I thought, why not add a comment input to that 404 page too, in case there is a legit 404 someone can report to you! </p><p>-----------------<br>

                 [05/Jan/2021:08:52:27] You're right to an extent - it does need active comment moderation if there are a lot of comments coming in - but then, so would a regular comments blog. At the moment I'm checking in two or three times a day - that will probably drop off unless I've *just* published something new. Rebuilding and pushing out takes maybe a second. One of the many benefits of being in the same physical location as the server :) - The Crow </p><p>-----------------<br>
                 &nbsp;
                 
                 [05/Jan/2021:02:14:03] Pretty interesting approach! Only issue I could see is if your site becomes greatly popular overnight or something and then the comments are delayed so it stifles user discussion in the time until you decide to rebuild. But I personally think it's cool either way </p><p>-----------------<br>

                 [01/Jan/2021:13:58:00] In response to 'this is stupid and can be spammed' - Well, not really. It's a manual review process. If I choose not to pull a comment from the logs, it just stays in the logs and is deleted after a day or two. Everything that appears in this comment section is here because I want it to be - I am deliberately not automating the process. Overall comment quality is low because for the purposes of this post, I'm letting absolutely everything through. When I *do* add more automation - magically echoing comments to a text file for my perusal, I will be using filters against known spammy domains, IPs, and keywords. Don't worry dude, it will be fine. - The Crow </p><p>-----------------<br>

<![CDATA[Twitter’s Birdwatch Is Fundamentally Flawed]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<div>

			
<p>Earlier this week, Twitter announced an initiative to combat misinformation on their platform that they call <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/introducing-birdwatch-a-community-based-approach-to-misinformation.html">Birdwatch</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210126122026/https://twitter.github.io/birdwatch/about/overview/">How Birdwatch works</a>: Volunteers sign up (assuming they meet all the requirements) and can add notes to fill in context on misleading tweets. Other users can rate these contextual tweets as helpful or not helpful. All of these “notes” and ratings of notes are completely transparent.</p>











<p>At its face, Birdwatch is an attempt to scale up the existing fact-checking capability used during the 2020 U.S. Elections while also crowdsourcing this decision-making.</p>



<p>I will give Twitter credit for two things, and only two things, before I get into the problems with their design.</p>



<ol><li>They’re distributing the power to fact-check bad tweets to their users rather than hoarding it for themselves.</li><li>They correctly emphasized transparency as a goal for this tool.</li></ol>



<p>But it’s not all sunshine and rainbows.</p>



<h2>The Fatal Flaw of Birdwatch’s Design</h2>



<p>There’s an old essay titled <em><a href="https://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/editorials/dumb/">The Six Dumbest Ideas in Computer Security</a></em>, that immediately identifies two problems with Birdwatch’s design. They also happen to be the first two items on the essay’s list!</p>



<ol><li><strong>Default Permit</strong></li><li><strong>Enumerating Badness</strong></li></ol>



<p>This is best illustrated by way of example.</p>



<p>Let’s assume there are two pathological liars hellbent on spreading misinformation on Twitter. They each tweet unsubstantiated claims about some facet of government or civil service. Birdwatch users catch only one of them, and correctly fact-check their tweet.</p>



<p>What happens to the other liar?</p>



<p>What happens if Birdwatch users can only identify one out of ten liars? One out of a hundred? One out of a thousand?! Et cetera.</p>







<p>To be clear: The biggest flaw in their product design is simply that their “notes” and “fact-checks” are negative indicators on known-bad tweets.</p>



<p>This will create a dark pattern: If a tweet slips past the Birdwatch users’ radars, it won’t be fact-checked. In turn, users won’t realize it’s misinformation. A popular term for the resulting conduct is <strong>coordinated inauthentic behavior</strong>.</p>



<p>This already happens to YouTube.</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="580" height="327" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1PGm8LslEb4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>



<p>Hell, this is already happening <em>to Twitter</em>:</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="580" height="327" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V-1RhQ1uuQ4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>



<h2>How To Fix Birdwatch</h2>



<p>I wrote an entire essay on <a href="https://medium.com/@soatok/defeating-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior-at-scale-a872badf721">Defeating Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior at Scale</a> in 2019. I <em>highly</em> recommend anyone at Twitter interested in actually solving the misinformation problem to give that a careful consideration.</p>







<p>But in a nutshell, the most important fix is to change the state machine underlying Birdwatch from:</p>



<ul><li>No notes -&gt; trustworthy</li><li>Notes -&gt; misinformation</li></ul>



<p>…to something <em>subtly</em> different:</p>



<ul><li>No notes -&gt; unvetted / be cautious</li><li>Notes -&gt;<ul><li>Negative notes -&gt; misinformation</li></ul><ul><li>Positive notes -&gt; verified by experts</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>This effectively creates a traffic light signal for users: Tweets start as yellow (exercise caution, which is the default) and may become green (affirmed by notes) or red (experts disagree).</p>



<h3>What Would This Change Accomplish?</h3>



<p>Malicious actors that accomplish Birdwatch evasion will only manage to encompass their message in caution tape. (Metaphorically speaking, anyway.)</p>



<p>If their goal is to spread misinformation while convincing the recipients of their message that they’re speaking the truth, they’ll have to get a green light–which is ideally more expensive to accomplish.</p>



<h3>Bonus Round</h3>



<p>I would also recommend some kind of “this smells fishy” button to signal Birdwatch contributors that this tweet needs fact-checking. Users might self-select into filter bubbles that Birdwatch users are totally absent from, and in turn come across things that are completely unvetted and possibly ambiguous.</p>



<p>While I have your attention, here’s a quality of life suggestion, on the house:</p>



<p>Being able to link claims together (e.g. reposted images with a false claim, n.b. like how the minions memes on Facebook) to deduplicate their claims about reality would save a lot of unnecessary headache.</p>



<p>(Anyone who has used Stack Overflow will appreciate the utility of being able to say “this is a duplicate of $otherThing”.)</p>



<h2>What If These Fundamental Flaws Remain Unfixed?</h2>



<p>Although Birdwatch will probably meet the immediate goal of scaling up the fact-checking efforts beyond what Twitter can provide (and satisfy the public relations requirements of tangibly doing <em>something</em> to combat this problem), propagandists and conspiracy theorists will simply become incentivized to evade Birdwatch contributors’ detection while spreading their lies.</p>



<p>As I said above, coordinated inauthentic behavior is already happening. This isn’t some abstract threat that only academics care about.</p>



<p>To the aid of the malicious, most users will confuse tweets that evaded detection with tweets that didn’t warrant correction. This might even lead to users trusting misinformation <em>more</em> than they would before Birdwatch. This would be a total self-own for the entire Birdwatch project.</p>

<![CDATA[Sudo: Buffer overflow in command line unescaping]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div>
<h3>Release Date:</h3><p>
January 26, 2021
</p><h3>Summary:</h3><p>
A serious heap-based buffer overflow has been discovered in sudo
that is exploitable by any local user. It has been given the name
<em>Baron Samedit</em> by its discoverer. The bug can be leveraged
to elevate privileges to root, even if the user is not listed in
the sudoers file. User authentication is not required to exploit
the bug.
</p><h3>Sudo versions affected:</h3><p>
Sudo versions 1.8.2 through 1.8.31p2 and 1.9.0 through 1.9.5p1 are
affected.
</p><h3>CVE ID:</h3><p>
This vulnerability has been assigned <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3156" onclick="getOutboundLink('http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3156');">CVE-2021-3156</a>
in the <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/" onclick="getOutboundLink('http://cve.mitre.org/');">Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures</a> database.
</p><h3>Details:</h3><p>
When sudo runs a command in <em>shell</em> mode, either via the
<strong>-s</strong> or <strong>-i</strong> command line option, it
escapes special characters in the command's arguments with a backslash.
The sudoers policy plugin will then remove the escape characters from
the arguments before evaluating the sudoers policy (which doesn't
expect the escape characters) if the command is being run in shell
mode.
</p><p>
A bug in the code that removes the escape characters will read
beyond the last character of a string if it ends with an unescaped
backslash character. Under normal circumstances, this bug would
be harmless since sudo has escaped all the backslashes in the
command's arguments. However, due to a different bug, this time
in the command line parsing code, it is possible to run <tt>sudoedit</tt>
with either the <strong>-s</strong> or <strong>-i</strong> options,
setting a flag that indicates shell mode is enabled. Because a
command is not actually being run, sudo does <strong>not</strong>
escape special characters. Finally, the code that decides whether
to remove the escape characters did not check whether a command is
actually being run, just that the shell flag is set. This inconsistency
is what makes the bug exploitable.
</p><p>
To test whether your version of sudo is vulnerable, the following
command can be used:
</p><pre>sudoedit -s '\' `perl -e 'print "A" x 65536'`
</pre><p>
If you receive a usage or error message, sudo is not vulnerable.
If the result is a <strong>Segmentation fault</strong>, sudo is
vulnerable.
</p><p>

</p><h3>Impact:</h3><p>
A local user may be able to exploit sudo to elevate privileges to
root as long as the sudoers file (usually /etc/sudoers) is present.
</p><h3>Workaround:</h3><p>
None. Sudo version 1.9.5p2 or a patched vendor-supported version
must be installed.
</p><h3>Fix:</h3><p>
The bug is fixed in sudo 1.9.5p2.
</p><h3>Credit:</h3><p>
Thanks to the Qualys Security Advisory team for their detailed bug
report and explanation of its implications.

Mimoun, the founder of the digital security nonprofit Horizontal, asked the participants to list messaging platforms that they'd heard of or used, and they quickly rattled off  <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-messenger-end-to-end-encryption-default/">Facebook Messenger</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/whatsapp-facebook-data-share-notification/">WhatsApp</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/signal-tips-private-messaging-encryption/">Signal</a>, and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/telegram-still-hasnt-removed-an-ai-bot-thats-abusing-women/">Telegram</a>. When Mimoun then asked them to name the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/encrypted-messaging-isnt-magic/">security advantages</a> of each of those options, several pointed to Telegram's encryption as a plus. It had been <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-isis-is-now-harder-to-track-onlinebut-thats-good-news/">used by Islamic extremists</a>, one noted, so it must be secure.</p><p>Mimoun explained that yes, Telegram encrypts messages. But by default it encrypts data only between your device and Telegram's server; you have to turn on end-to-end encryption to prevent the server itself from seeing the messages. In fact, the group messaging feature that the Southeast Asian activists used most often offers no end-to-end encryption at all. They'd have to trust Telegram not to cooperate with any government that tries to compel it to cooperate in surveilling users. One of them asked where Telegram is located. The company, Mimoun explained, is based in the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>First laughter, then a more serious feeling of "awkward realization" spread through the call, says Mimoun. After a pause, one of the participants spoke: "We're going to have to regroup and think about what we want to do about this." In a follow-up session, another member of the group told Mimoun the moment was a "rude awakening."</p><p>Earlier this month, Telegram announced that it had hit a milestone of 500 million active monthly users and pointed to a single 72-hour period when 25 million people had joined the service. That surge of adoption seems to have had two simultaneous sources: First, right-wing Americans have sought less-moderated communications platforms after <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-trump-ban-easy-fixing-facebook-twitter-hard/">many were banned</a> from Twitter or Facebook for hate speech and disinformation, and after Amazon dropped hosting for their preferred social media service <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/parler-app-free-speech-influencers/">Parler</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/parler-russia-privacy/">taking it offline</a>.</p><p>Telegram's founder, Pavel Durov, however, has attributed the boost more to WhatsApp's clarification of a privacy policy that includes sharing certain data—though not the content of messages—with its corporate parent, Facebook. Tens of millions of WhatsApp's users <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/whatsapp-facebook-data-share-notification/">responded to that restatement of its (years-old) info-sharing practices</a> by fleeing the service, and many went to Telegram, no doubt attracted in part by its claims of "heavily encrypted" messaging. "We've had surges of downloads before, throughout our 7-year history of protecting user privacy," Durov wrote from his Telegram account. "But this time is different. People no longer want to exchange their privacy for free services."</p><p>But ask Raphael Mimoun—or other security professionals who have analyzed Telegram and who spoke to WIRED about its security and privacy shortcomings—and it's clear that Telegram is far from the best-in-class privacy haven that Durov describes and that many at-risk users believe it to be. "People turn to Telegram because they think it's going to keep them safe," says Mimoun, who last week <a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://hackernoon.com/7-reason-why-telegram-is-insecure-by-design-but-millions-still-flock-to-it-ignoring-privacy-concerns-qq1o344c&quot;}" href="https://hackernoon.com/7-reason-why-telegram-is-insecure-by-design-but-millions-still-flock-to-it-ignoring-privacy-concerns-qq1o344c" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">published a blog post about Telegram's flaws</a> that he says was based on "five years of bottled up frustration" about the misperceptions of its security. "There is just a really big gap between what people feel and believe and the reality of the privacy and security of the app."</p><p>Telegram's privacy protections aren't necessarily faulty or broken on a fundamental level, says Nadim Kobeissi, a cryptographer and founder of the Paris-based cryptography consultancy Symbolic Software. But when it comes to encrypting users' communications so that they can't be surveilled, it simply doesn't measure up to WhatsApp—not to mention the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/signal-encrypted-messaging-features-mainstream/">nonprofit secure messaging app Signal</a>, which Kobeissi and most other security professionals recommend. That's because WhatsApp and Signal end-to-end encrypt every message and call by default, so that their own servers never access the content of conversations. Telegram by default only uses "transport layer" encryption that protects the connection from the user to the server rather than from one user to another. "In terms of encryption, Telegram is just not as good as WhatsApp," says Kobeissi. "The fact that encryption is not enabled by default already puts it way behind WhatsApp."</p></div></div><div><div><p>Telegram does offer end-to-end encryption for one-to-one chats but requires users to enable a "secret chats" feature, which must be switched on for every contact individually. Starting that secret chat requires four menu taps that aren't particularly intuitive. (Tap the contact's name, then "more," then "start secret chat," and then confirm when a prompt asks whether you're sure.) Conversation history from the default chat doesn't carry over to the “secret” one, and you have to initiate that encryption option every time you pick a conversation back up with a contact.</p><p>"Would you rather go for the car where airbags work any time you get into a crash?" asks Kobeissi. "Or are you going to go for the car where, every time you turn it on you have to type in a PIN to enable airbags? Why not have them on by default? There's going to be a time where you're going to forget to type that PIN and you're going to get into a crash."</p><p>Worse still, Telegram doesn't offer its secret chats feature at all for group chats, where many of its most at-risk users congregate. It also stores all default chat histories on its servers. That adds a measure of convenience; threads conveniently reappear whenever you install the app on a new device. But the approach leaves them vulnerable to being read by everyone, from Telegram itself to hackers who manage to breach the company's network and legal authorities who compel it to share user data.</p><p>That threat of government coercion became more concrete when Telegram moved its development team—and the official headquarters of one company in the Telegram Group—from Berlin to Dubai three years ago. Though Telegram keeps its servers spread elsewhere around the world, that location nonetheless leaves the company particularly vulnerable to pressure from the United Arab Emirates, a country known for its record of aggressively <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/08/hacking-group-selling-ios-vulnerabilities-state-actors/">hacking</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/totok-google-play-apple-app-store-uae-surveillance/">surveilling</a> human rights activists and dissidents.</p><p>When WIRED reached out to Telegram for comment on these criticisms, its head of marketing, Mike Ravdonikas, responded in a Telegram message that the company doesn't store data in the UAE and has never received a data request from the UAE government. He added that its "lean Dubai-based team is ready to move to a different location if it ever faces pressure." As for its lack of end-to-end encryption by default, Ravdonikas writes that Telegram's non-secret chats have features that "are not possible to implement in an end-to-end encrypted environment," such as persistent chat histories across devices, very large user groups, and sending large documents and video. "We are not going to cripple Telegram by throwing away dozens of its great features because some folks are misled by marketing tricks from our competitors or are too lazy to start Secret Chats when they think they need them," Telegram founder Durov wrote on his public Telegram channel earlier this month.</p><p>But many cryptographers remain wary of Telegram's encryption scheme, even in secret chats. The company uses its own unique encryption protocol known as MTProto. That preference for homebrewed encryption is widely considered deeply unwise by cryptographers who have long held that it's far safer to implement standard, well-tested protocols. After all, sussing out the vulnerabilities in any new protocol takes years of work and careful auditing, no matter how clever a company's in-house cryptographers may be.</p><p>Telegram's MTProto protocol isn't obviously broken in a practical way, concedes Matt Green, a cryptographer at Johns Hopkins University who has consulted for Facebook on encrypted messaging systems. But it's uniquely "weird," he says, in a way that suggests its inventors don't understand tried-and-true cryptography practices and raises his suspicions that it may yet have undiscovered vulnerabilities. "It's like if everyone else in the world has agreed that we're going to use drywall to do the walls in a house, and then you've got somebody who's using toothpaste," says Green. "Even if the toothpaste works and makes a nice wall, that's weird. How do you know they're not doing other weird, nonstandard things when they put the electrical wiring into the house? And that's what scares me."</p></div></div><div><div><p>Telegram's Ravdonikas argues that “Telegram encryption relies on classical algorithms, because we consider some approaches promoted by US-based cryptographers after 9-11/the Patriot Act (which your sources refer to as 'state of the art cryptography') questionable."</p><p>That rebuttal elicited an eye-roll emoji from Johns Hopkins' Green. "We use these standard approaches because they have public and verifiable mathematical proofs of security," Green says. The standard protocols that Telegram avoids have had plenty of scrutiny outside of the US, he adds in response to the allegation that the Patriot Act biases US cryptographers who have examined them. And Telegram itself uses standard crypto algorithms developed and certified by US government agencies, just in nonstandard ways.</p><p>But Green emphasizes that any criticism of Telegram's encryption protocol is almost academic. The real, overarching problem with Telegram's security protections is that it doesn't actually offer end-to-end encryption by default. "If you're not using secret chats, then Telegram and anyone who hacks into Telegram's servers sees all of your communications. And that's really the biggest problem," Green says. "Signal has default end-to-end encryption. WhatsApp has default end-to-end encryption. Telegram does not."</p><p>Raphael Mimoun, the digital security trainer, says …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>
Keyboard input on Terminals has many deficiencies to it. I want them all fixed. I have a plan on how to do it but it Needs Your Help
</p>

<p>
I want terminal keypresses to Just Work. What do I mean Just Work? I mean programs in a simple orthogonal way, can determine the key that was pressed, and this model should easily map to the user's expectation.
</p>

<p>
Why doesn't it currently? Currently, there are a number of classes of physically-distinct key presses that terminals encode using the same bytes.

</p><ul>
<li>Special names for some ASCII characters collide with <tt>Ctrl</tt>-modified letters. For example, <tt>Tab</tt> is <tt>Ctrl-I</tt>.</li>
<li>The <tt>Ctrl</tt> modifier encodes lower or upper-case letters identically; <tt>Ctrl-I</tt> is <tt>Ctrl-Shift-I</tt>.</li>
<li>UTF-8 collides with 8bit-high characters; e.g. <tt>Alt-C</tt> might be encoded as <tt>0xc3</tt>, which is the first UTF-8 byte of many Unicode characters, such as Ã©.</li>
<li>Sometimes programs rely on timing information to distinguish, for example, <tt>Alt-C</tt> from the two separate keypresses of <tt>Escape</tt> followed by <tt>C</tt>. This results in delays to recognise a plain <tt>Escape</tt> key if the time is too long, or erroneously recognising <tt>Escape</tt> followed by a letter as an <tt>Alt</tt>-modified letter if typed too quickly, or if the time limit is too short.</li>
</ul><p>

Even when keys produce unique unambiguous byte sequences, it may be that some programs cannot recognise them.
</p><ul>
<li>The way terminals encode modified keypresses is an extension to the original methods used in the 1970s, and some older code cannot parse them correctly. Press <tt>Ctrl-Up</tt> on a modern xterm and watch a program fail and die in all sorts of interesting ways because they don't have real CSI parsers.</li>
</ul>



<h2>How can we fix this?</h2>

<p>
By having a sane and sensible model on BOTH ends of the terminal interaction, and a well-defined way of communicating.
How exactly we go about this really depends who you are:
</p>

<h3>Authors of Programs that Read Terminal Keypresses</h3>

<p>
The simplest way to go about this is to use the key input handling features of my terminal UI library, <a href="http://www.leonerd.org.uk/code/libtickit/">libtickit</a>.
Failing this, if you're using some existing system of keyboard input, such as GNU Readline, I suggest you apply pressure to the maintainers of that system until they adopt this method of reading extended keypresses.
</p>

<h3>Authors of Terminal Emulators</h3>

<p>
Making a terminal send the correct key encodings should be a relatively easy task, given the encoding scheme already splits modifiers and keysyms in a way likely to be similar to the underlying input system at work, such as X11 or Win32.
</p>

<h3>End-users of Programs</h3>

<p>Even if you're not the author of a program like this, you can still help fix the situation. Write to the maintainer of your program, report a bug. Explain that you wanted to use such a keybinding, or whatever the problem was. Explain that, because their program doesn't correctly handle these cases, it wasn't possible, but if they were to adopt this scheme, then it would be and your problem would be solved. With enough voices, even the most stubbon developer who believes it's 1970 and everyone lives behind a green-phosphor glass teletype on a 9,600 baud modem, can still change his ways.</p>

<h2>Encoding Specification</h2>

<p>
The primary motivation of this scheme is to encode any possible keypress uniquely; that a keypress maps to one possible sequence of bytes, and a valid sequence of bytes encodes only one keypress. For backward compability, it is also required that any keypress that can be represented without this scheme is also represented by the same bytes within it; that is, this scheme is an <em>extension</em> of existing encodings, not a replacement of.
</p>

<dl>

<dt>Modifiers</dt>
<dd>
The two encoding forms used by this specification to encode modifiers both put a number as their second parameter whose value is 1 + a bitmask encoding the modifiers. We add 1 because by convention, a missing CSI parameter is equivalent to 1, so in the "unmodified" state the modifier field would be 1 - we must add 1 to it so that no-bits-set (unmodified) is encoded as 1 (though, in practice, we rarely use the 1 form explicitly).<br>

Thus, the various encoding forms using these modifiers will look like:
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>unmodified</td><td>Shift+</td><td>Alt+</td><td>Alt+Shift+</td><td>Ctrl+</td><td>Ctrl+Shift+</td><td>Ctrl+Alt+</td><td>Ctrl+Alt+Shift+</td></tr>
<tr><td>(direct UTF-8)</td><td><tt>CSI ...;2 u</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;3 u</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;4 u</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;5 u</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;6 u</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;7 u</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;8 u</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>CSI ... ~</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;2 ~</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;3 ~</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;4 ~</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;5 ~</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;6 ~</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;7 ~</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;8 ~</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>CSI X</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 1;2 X</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 1;3 X</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 1;4 X</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 1;5 X</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 1;6 X</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 1;7 X</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 1;8 X</tt></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
These various forms are explained more below.
</dd>

<dt>Unicode Characters</dt>
<dd>
When unmodified, just send UTF-8 bytes as normal. No UTF-8 sequence of a regular character starts with a <tt>C0</tt> or <tt>C1</tt> byte, so these will be unique. The <tt>Shift</tt> key should not be considered as a modifier for Unicode characters, because it is most likely used to obtain the character in the first place (e.g. the shift key is often required to obtain the <tt>!</tt> symbol).<br>

Certain key presses have special behaviours with modifiers. <tt>Alt</tt> tends to prefix <tt>Escape</tt>. <tt>Ctrl</tt> tends to mask with <tt>0x1f</tt>. When the simplest form of these keys are pressed, they should be encoded as previously.
Existing schemes lack a way to encode more general modifiers with Unicode codepoints at present, so we are at liberty to invent something new for these. The CSI <tt>u</tt> command lies in the private-use area, so has no fixed meaning at present.
<pre>CSI [codepoint];[modifier] u</pre>
We can use this to represent the problematic combinations of keys; for example variations on the letter "A" (ASCII decimal value 65) and "a":
<table>
<tbody><tr><td></td><td>unmodified</td><td>Alt+</td><td>Ctrl+</td><td>Ctrl+Alt+</td></tr>
<tr><td>without Shift</td><td><tt>a</tt></td><td><tt>ESC a</tt></td><td><tt>0x01</tt></td><td><tt>ESC 0x01</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td>with Shift</td><td><tt>A</tt></td><td><tt>ESC A</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 65;5 u</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 65;7 u</tt></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
This same pattern is continued for the other letters, except for the awkward cases of 

We can now represent the usual problematic keys unambiguously:
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>Ctrl-I = <tt>CSI 105;5 u</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Shift-I = <tt>CSI  73;5 u</tt></td><td>Tab        = <tt>0x09</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td>Ctrl-M = <tt>CSI 109;5 u</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Shift-M = <tt>CSI  77;5 u</tt></td><td>Enter      = <tt>0x0d</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td>Ctrl-[ = <tt>CSI  91;5 u</tt></td><td>Ctrl-{       = <tt>CSI 123;5 u</tt></td><td>Escape     = <tt>0x1b</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">Ctrl-@ = <tt>CSI  64;5u</tt></td>                                 <td>Ctrl-Space = <tt>0x00</tt></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
Because other <tt>C0</tt> bytes do not have usual alternative names or keypresses, these can continue to be sent using the simple single-byte encoding. This is essential to ensuring that legacy systems continue to interpret them correctly (e.g. <tt>termios</tt> still sends <tt>SIGINT</tt> on Ctrl-C).
The <tt>Space</tt> key is unique among the printing Unicode keys in that its behaviour doesn't normally change as a result of the <tt>Shift</tt> modifier. We can capture this by encoding it using CSIu - uniquely, the only printing Unicode key for which we use this:
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>Ctrl-Space = <tt>0x00</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Shift-Space = <tt>CSI 32;6 u</tt></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</dd>

<dt>Modified C0 controls</dt>
<dd>
The problematic keys listed above plus <tt>Backspace</tt> can be represented using the <tt>CSI u</tt> encoding when any modifiers are present. Because these symbols are almost universally found on their own physical keycap, there is no problem with encoding the <tt>Shift</tt> modifier as well, with the value 1. We encode these keys using their normal <tt>ASCII</tt> codepoint values.
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>Enter     = <tt>0x0d</tt></td><td>Shift-Enter     = <tt>CSI  13;2 u</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Enter     = <tt>CSI  13;5 u</tt></td><td rowspan="4">...</td></tr>
<tr><td>Escape    = <tt>0x1b</tt></td><td>Shift-Escape    = <tt>CSI  27;2 u</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Escape    = <tt>CSI  27;5 u</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td>Backspace = <tt>0x7f</tt></td><td>Shift-Backspace = <tt>CSI 127;2 u</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Backspace = <tt>CSI 127;5 u</tt></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
The <tt>Space</tt> key is trickier, because it's traditionally used with the <tt>Ctrl</tt> modifier to obtain the <tt>NUL</tt> byte encoding.
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>Space     = <tt>0x20</tt></td><td>Shift-Space     = <tt>CSI  32;2 u</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Space     = <tt>0x00</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Shift-Space = <tt>CSI  32;6 u</tt></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
Since most terminals repesent <tt>Shift-Tab</tt> as <tt>CSI Z</tt>, that needs handling specially as well.
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>Tab = <tt>0x09</tt></td><td>Shift-Tab = <tt>CSI  Z</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Tab = <tt>CSI 9;5 u</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Shift-Tab = <tt>CSI 1;5 Z</tt></td><td>...</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</dd>

<dt>Special keys</dt>
<dd>
Existing schemes usually use <tt>CSI ~</tt> to encode special (i.e. non-Unicode) keypresses. XTerm and other terminals use the second CSI parameter to pass encoding the set of modifiers in effect.
<pre>CSI [number];[modifier] ~</pre>
If the modifier value is 1; i.e. there are no modifiers, then for backward-compatibility to send the same bytes as previously, it should be omitted, sending simply
<pre>CSI [number] ~</pre>
<table>
 <tbody><tr><th>Key</th><th>Number</th></tr>
 <tr><td>Insert   </td><td> 2</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Delete   </td><td> 3</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Page Up  </td><td> 5</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Page Down</td><td> 6</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Home (*) </td><td> 7</td></tr>
 <tr><td>End (*)  </td><td> 8</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F1 (*)   </td><td>11</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F2 (*)   </td><td>12</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F3 (*)   </td><td>13</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F4 (*)   </td><td>14</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F5       </td><td>15</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F6       </td><td>17 (**)</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F7       </td><td>18</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F8       </td><td>19</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F9       </td><td>20</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F10      </td><td>21</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F11      </td><td>23</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F12      </td><td>24</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<b>(*)</b>: Note that some terminals prefer to encode <tt>Home</tt>, <tt>End</tt> and the <tt>F1</tt> to <tt>F4</tt> function keys using shorter <tt>CSI letter</tt> encodings. Parsers or other receiving programs should accept either encoding identically.
<b>(**)</b>: Note also the discontinuity of numbered function keys. After every group of 5 F keys there is a missing number; so every 6th number is not used by an F key (10, 16, 22, 28,...). This is purely for historic reasons; the numbered F keys on the original VTxx keyboards had physical gaps in these locations.
</dd>

<dt>Really special keypresses</dt>
<dd>
Some terminals encode certain keys outside of the <tt>CSI ~</tt> encoding, instead picking a different CSI command. This too can accomodate the modifier in its second position.
<pre>CSI 1;[modifier] {ABCDFHPQRS}</pre>
<table>
 <tbody><tr><th>Key</th><th>Code</th></tr>
 <tr><td>Up</td>   <td>A</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Down</td> <td>B</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Right</td><td>C</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Left</td> <td>D</td></tr>
 <tr><td>End</td>  <td>F</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Home</td> <td>H</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F1</td>   <td>P</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F2</td>   <td>Q</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F3</td>   <td>R</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F4</td>   <td>S</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
As before, if the modifier is 1 then the modifier parameter should be omitted. Since the leading number is also implied, this can be omitted too.
<pre>CSI {ABCDFHPQRS}</pre>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Advantages: solves above problems. <b>Can be fitted into existing programs with a minimum of fuss and without breaking back-compat</b>.
</p>

<p>
Extension: We can take it one step further, and require CSI to be sent as the single 8bit code <tt>0x9b</tt> and never as 7bit multibyte <tt>0x1b 0x4b</tt> (Escape [). This reserves the single <tt>0x1b</tt> byte exclusively for the Escape key. If this is known to be in effect, then it is no longer required to use timing information to recover accurate keypress information, as every possible keypress now has a unique encoding. Even if this is not known to be in effect, programs ought to accept the single <tt>0x9b</tt> byte encoding of CSI anyway, in anticipation of a time when terminals may send it encoded this way by default.

The new funding will allow Ukko to enter clinical trials with its investigational therapeutic for peanut allergy. It will also accelerate development of Ukko’s gluten that is designed for people with celiac and other gluten sensitivities. The round was led by Leaps by Bayer – the impact investment arm of Bayer – and was joined by Continental Grain Company, PeakBridge Ventures, Skyviews Life Science and Fall Line Capital, as well as existing investors Khosla Ventures, Innovation Endeavors, and TIME Ventures, the investment fund of Marc Benioff.</p><h2><b>Novel approach with AI-powered platform</b></h2><p>Ukko’s novel approach uses a proprietary AI-powered platform that precisely engineers food proteins to eliminate their allergenicity, while keeping their good biochemical and nutritional characteristics. The platform uses patient samples, computational biology, immunology, and protein engineering to make proteins that do not trigger the immune system.</p><p>“We are at a unique crossroads in the history of science,” said Prof. Yanay Ofran, Chairman and Co-founder of Ukko. “Big data allows us to understand the underpinnings of food sensitivities. Computational tools allow us to precisely design the proteins that make up our bodies and our food. New genome editing technologies allow us to rewrite DNA to produce these new proteins in living cells. Ukko sits at the intersection of these breakthrough technologies, allowing us to redefine healthy food at the molecular level, based on real data.”</p><p>Ukko has already built one of the largest clinically-validated molecular maps of food allergies, which unlocks critical data and allows the company a rich foundation for further innovation. Ukko has also generated promising data, based on patient samples, that suggests the company’s investigational peanut and gluten proteins do not trigger allergic reactions responses in the immune system of patients.</p><p>“We are at the forefront of a revolution. Pharma and the food industry will redefine how they think about their products and missions,” said Anat Binur, CEO and Co-Founder of Ukko. “Hundreds of millions of people around the world suffer from food allergies and experts see it as a global epidemic. Ending food allergy is critical and is only the beginning. Ukko’s tech has the potential to leverage science and human data to redesign our food and medicine.”</p><h2><b>Improved gluten proteins and therapy for peanut allergy</b></h2><p>Ukko has a holistic food-to-therapy approach to solving food allergies and sensitivities. On the food side, Ukko is working on improved gluten proteins that are especially designed for people with celiac and other gluten sensitivities, which allows bakers, food companies, and home cooks to make delicious bread, pizza, pasta, and baked goods that everyone can eat. On the therapeutic side, Ukko is using its protein design platform to develop a new and promising investigational therapy for peanut allergy. Ukko’s future pipeline includes plans to address additional major food allergens.</p><p>“Ukko’s investigative approaches to solving allergies and food sensitivities both from the food side and the patient therapeutics side have the possibility of delivering enormous benefits for humanity,” said Juergen Eckhardt, MD, Head of Leaps by Bayer, which was built to drive fundamental breakthroughs in the fields of health and agriculture through new technologies. “One of the big challenges we’re addressing through our Leaps investments is attempting to reverse autoimmune diseases, which have enormous impacts on the world’s food systems and our health systems in every community around the globe. We are proud to lead this investment in Ukko and help solve the biggest allergies and food sensitivities. It is a great fit to our global leadership role in both health and nutrition.”</p><p>“I have been a witness to my patients’ growing urgency to discover a cure for food allergies. While there are tremendous breakthroughs coming from the research and biotech worlds, safety remains a significant hurdle. Ukko’s efforts to solve these challenges for allergies and sensitivities is one of the most promising and exciting approaches I have seen” said Prof. Lynda Schneider, Director of the Allergy Program at Boston Children’s Hospital and Professor of Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School.</p><h2><b>Number of people suffering food allergies to climb in the coming years</b></h2><p>Hundreds of millions of people around the world suffer from food allergies and experts predict the numbers will continue to climb in the coming years. In the U.S. alone, one in 13 children has food allergies (about two in every classroom) and every three minutes a food allergy reaction sends someone to the emergency room. The incidence of celiac disease has been doubling every 15 years and – even at that rate of growth – over 80% of patients remain undiagnosed, leaving these people with higher risk for developing other serious conditions like anemia or even cancer. Economically, food allergies and sensitivities cost more than $25 billion<sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup> every year in the U.S. alone and place enormous strain on families, communities, the healthcare system, and the ag and food industries.</p><p>Ukko has formed an Advisory Board that includes some of the world’s top clinical experts in food allergy and sensitivities, and experts in food and agriculture innovation. The Advisory Board supports the company on the policy, business strategy, science, and clinical aspects of Ukko’s work. Some of Ukko’s advisors include<b> Bernhard Van Lengerich</b>, Former Chief Science Officer &amp; Vice President for Technology Strategy at General Mills;<b> Ann M. Veneman</b>, Former US Secretary of Agriculture; <b>Dr. Wesley A. Burks</b>, Dean and CEO of the Univ. of North Carolina (UNC) School of Medicine and UNC Health; <b>Dr. Edwin Kim</b>, Associate Professor, Allergy &amp; Immunology Program Director, UNC Food Allergy Initiative; <b>Dr. Kari Nadeau</b>, Director of the Sean N.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><a href="https://leontrolski.github.io/index.html"><img src="https://leontrolski.github.io/pic.png">â‡¦</a><p><em>Discussion <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25933121">here</a> and <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/ldzfsw/oo_python_is_mostly_pointless">here</a>. Call to arms for idiomatic OO code <a href="https://github.com/leontrolski/call-to-arms">here</a>.</em></p><p>People bash OO a lot these days, I'm increasingly coming to the opinion they're right, at least in Python. My point here is not to argue that OO is bad per se, more that its introduction is simply unnecessary, AKA not useful.</p><h2>Oli's Conjecture</h2><blockquote>All OO code can be refactored into equivalent non-OO code that's as easy or more easy to understand.</blockquote><p>Let's take an example that should pan out in OO's favour, we've all seen/written code somewhat like the following:</p><pre><code>class ApiClient:
    def __init__(self, root_url: str, session_cls: sessionmaker):
        self.root_url = root_url
        self.session_cls = session_cls

    def construct_url(self, entity: str) -&gt; str:
        return f"{self.root_url}/v1/{entity}"

    def get_items(self, entity: str) -&gt; List[Item]:
        resp = requests.get(self.construct_url(entity))
        resp.raise_for_status()
        return [Item(**n) for n in resp.json()["items"]]

    def save_items(self, entity: str) -&gt; None:
        with scoped_session(self.session_cls) as session:
            session.add(self.get_items(entity))


class ClientA(ApiClient):
    def construct_url(self, entity: str) -&gt; str:
        return f"{self.root_url}/{entity}"


class ClientB(ApiClient):
    def construct_url(self, entity: str) -&gt; str:
        return f"{self.root_url}/a/special/place/{entity}"


client_a = ClientA("https://client-a", session_cls)
client_a.save_items("bars")</code></pre><p>We chose OO it because we wanted to bind the <code>root_url</code> to something and we didn't want to pass around the <code>sessionmaker</code>. We also wanted to utilise inheritance to hook into a method halfway through the call stack.</p><p>But what if we do just pass data around, and write 'boring' functions, what happens then?</p><pre><code>@dataclass
class Client:
    root_url: str
    url_layout: str


client_a = Client(
    root_url="https://client-a",
    url_layout="{root_url}/{entity}",
)

client_b = Client(
    root_url="https://client-b",
    url_layout="{root_url}/a/special/place/{entity}",
)


def construct_url(client: Client, entity: str) -&gt; str:
    return client.url_layout.format(root_url=client.root_url, entity=entity)


def get_items(client: Client, entity: str) -&gt; List[Item]:
    resp = requests.get(construct_url(client, entity))
    resp.raise_for_status()
    return [Item(**n) for n in resp.json()["items"]]


def save_items(client: Client, session_cls: session_cls, entity: str) -&gt; None:
    with scoped_session(session_cls) as session:
        session.add(get_items(client, entity))


save_items(client_a, session_cls, "bars")</code></pre><p>We had to pass round the <code>Client</code> and the <code>session_cls</code> around.</p><p>ðŸ¤·</p><p>Who cares? We even wrote like 10% fewer characters. Also, the conjecture stands, the resulting code is at least as easy to understand and we didn't need any OO.</p><p>I've heard this style referred to as the <b>bag-of-functions</b> style. That is to say, all your code just consists of typed data and module-namespaced-bags-of-functions.</p><h2>What about long lived global-y things?</h2><p>Use <a href="https://leontrolski.github.io/sane-config.html">this pattern</a> to reuse config/db session classes over the lifetime of an application.</p><h2>What about interfaces/abstract base classes?</h2><p>Just try writing without them, I promise it's going to be OK. <em>(To be fair, it's only the introduction of type hints to Python that has made the <b>bag-of-functions</b> style so pleasant).</em></p><h2>What about impure things?</h2><p>If you've taken the pure-FP/hexagonal-architecture pill, you want to write pure classes that take impure 'adapter' instances for <code>getting-the-current-datetime/API-calls/talking-to-the-db/other-impure-stuff</code>. The idea is nice in principal - should be good for testing right? - in practice, you can just use <a href="https://github.com/spulec/freezegun">freezegun</a> / use <a href="https://github.com/getsentry/responses">responses</a> / <a href="https://dhh.dk/2014/slow-database-test-fallacy.html">test with the db</a> (the <code>other-impure-stuff</code> tends to not actually exist) and save yourself a lot of hassle.</p><h2>Exceptions:</h2><p>I'd like to make exceptions for the following:</p><ul><li>You'll notice I put <code>@dataclass</code>s in the refactored code, these are fine - they're just record types. Python 5 will only have these, not 'normal' classes.</li><li>It's fine to subclass <code>Exception</code>s.  The usage of <code>try: ... except SomeClass: ...</code> fundamentally ties you to a heirarchical worldview, this is fine, just don't make it too complicated.</li><li><code>Enum</code>s - same as above, they fit in well with the rest of Python.</li><li>Very, very occasionally (at least in application development), you come up with a core type that's used so often, it's nice to have the cutesy stuff - think something like a <code>pandas.DataFrame</code>/<code>sqlalchemy.Session</code>. In general though, don't kid yourself that you're building anything that exciting, it's just vanity getting the better of you.</li></ul><h2>I lied.</h2><blockquote>My point here is not to argue that OO is bad per se.</blockquote><p>OK, I lied, it's not just a case of OO being a largely futile addition to the language, it's that it often obscures the problem at hand and encourages bad behaviours:</p><ul><li>It encourages you to mutate. Bag-of-functions makes it feel icky to mutate arguments - as it should feel. (Feel free to mutate within the confines of your function BTW, let's not go mad FP).</li><li>It's somewhat just the return of global variables. Not being able to share data between functions with <code>self</code> forces you to write functions with a smaller state-space that are easier to test.</li><li>Smooshing in functions in with your data makes it harder to serialise anything - in a world of REST APIs, serialisability is super useful.</li><li>It encourages mad inheritance hierarchies - this has been talked about at length elsewhere.</li><li>Most importantly though, it adds nothing, it's just noise that distracts from the problem at hand and makes it harder to navigate/comprehend your code.</li></ul><h2>Notes</h2><ul><li><a href="https://leontrolski.github.io/poor-mans-object.html">I've written before about the poor man's object/closure thingy.</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9pEzgHorH0">A classic video in the OO-bashing genre.</a></li></ul>

        <p>Have you ever wondered what’s the smallest amount of static storage (code +
data) needed to map emoji :shortcodes: to emoji?</p>
<p>Probably not… but now that I’ve posed the question, aren’t you at least a
little curious what the answer might be?</p>
<p>So hey, if you’ve got some time to spare, why not stick around a while and learn
a bit about cool topics such as perfect hashing, probabilistic data structures,
and 2D dynamic programming algorithms?</p>
<p>Take a break from solving whatever “important problem” you’re working on, kick
back, relax, and join me on my [somewhat useless] quest to find a highly
compressed emoji :shortcode: lookup function!</p>
<p>
  <img alt="A GIF of the online demo" src="https://prilik.com/blog/assets/emoji-shortcodes/shortcode_demo.gif">

<h2 id="what-even-is-a-highly-compressed-emoji-shortcode-lookup-function">What even is a “Highly Compressed Emoji Shortcode Lookup Function”?<a href="#what-even-is-a-highly-compressed-emoji-shortcode-lookup-function" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>Before embarking on our quest, we should probably clarify what it is we’re
looking for exactly exactly.</p>
<p>We want to write a function that accepts shortcode strings as input, and outputs
UTF-8 emoji as output:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// e.g: shortcode_to_emoji("flamingo") -&gt; Some("🦩")
</span><span></span><span>fn</span> <span>shortcode_to_emoji</span>(input: <span>&amp;</span><span>str</span>) -&gt; Option<span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>At first glance, this doesn’t seem too difficult: just find a free, open source
dataset of emoji shortcodes, load that data into memory, construct a hashmap,
and start querying it - easy peasy!</p>
<p>Not so fast.</p>
<p>While that approach would work just fine on your fancy shmancy
Linux/Windows/macOS/TempleOS powered desktop computer, what if we wanted to run
this lookup function on something a little bit more… embedded? If we tried to
dynamically construct a hashmap at runtime on a tiny, resource-constrained
ARM/AVR microcontroller, we’d very quickly run out of dynamic memory (assuming
something like <code>malloc</code> is even <em>available</em> on said platform).</p>
<p>Indeed, therein lies the need for a “Highly Compressed” lookup function - if we
want to run this code on an embedded system, the lookup function will have to
occupy as little static storage (code <em>and</em> read-only data) as possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At this point, you might be thinking to yourself “who in their right mind
would want to map emoji shortcodes on embedded hardware?” Fair enough! I’ve
included my inspiration behind this wild endeavor in the next section.</p>

<h2 id="-inspiration-">💡 Inspiration 💡<a href="#-inspiration-" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>I’m a big fan of
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mechanicalkeyboards">custom mechanical keyboards</a>, as
aside from looking and sounding awesome, they’re also an excellent
hardware-hacking platform. Most custom mechanical keyboards use the open source
<a href="https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware">QMK firmware</a>, which comes with a host of
built-in features for doing just about anything you’d want on a keyboard.</p>
<p>One particularly useful QMK feature is its ability to
<a href="https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/software-features/feature_unicode">type Unicode characters</a>.
In a nutshell, you can program your keyboard such that when a certain key (or
sequence of keys) is pressed, it will send whatever keystrokes are required to
input Unicode on any of the several
<a href="https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/software-features/feature_unicode#2-input-modes-id-input-modes">supported platforms</a>.
This is great, because it means that the 🅱 emoji is never more than a few
keystrokes away!</p>
<p>One somewhat annoying limitation of QMK’s built-in Unicode support is that users
are required to define which emoji they’d like to use <em>ahead of time</em>. While
it’s not too difficult to find a set of “workhorse” emoji to preload onto the
keyboard, it’d certainly be convenient to also be able to type more “bespoke”
emoji when the need arises. Sure, quick and easy access to the 🅱 emoji is great
and all, but what about those rare cases where I quickly need access to the 🦩
emoji? What am I supposed to do - use my OS’s built-in emoji picker like a
<em>peasant??</em> Never!</p>
<p>And so, I decided to spend my valuable free time on something some folks might
call “a total waste of time”: writing a Rust library that exports a single
function that can look up emoji shortcodes using the minimum amount of code +
read-only data, and without requiring <em>any</em> heap allocation!</p>
<p>Now, without further ado, let’s dive into the implementation!</p>
<h2 id="-getting-a-feel-for-the-data-">📝 Getting a feel for the Data 📝<a href="#-getting-a-feel-for-the-data-" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>First things first, we’ll need a dataset of emoji shortcodes to work with. For
this project, I decided to use the same emoji database as used by GitHub, since
it’s the one I’m most familiar with, and it’s also readily available as a big
‘ol
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gemoji/master/db/emoji.json">JSON blob</a>.
The particular dataset exhibits the following properties:</p>
<!-- Markdown doesn't support tables without a header smh -->
<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>total shortcode, emoji pairs</td>
            <td>1848</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>raw shortcode character data</td>
            <td>18715 bytes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>raw emoji UTF-8 character data</td>
            <td>11096 bytes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>average shortcode length</td>
            <td>10.12716 bytes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>average emoji length</td>
            <td>6.004329 bytes</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>Converting this data set into a CSV file of raw <code>shortcode,emoji</code> pairs would
result in roughly <strong>~34kb</strong> file. Aside from being a totally impractical data
structure for querying on an embedded system, 34kb is quite a bit of data in an
embedded context! Let’s see if we can do any better…</p>
<h2 id="-implementation-">🛠️ Implementation 🛠️<a href="#-implementation-" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>Since we know all the key-value pairs ahead of time, a good place to start off
might be to generate a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_hash_function">perfect hash map</a> of
shortcodes to emoji at compile time. Unlike typical hash functions, <em>perfect</em>
hash functions guarantee that each individual valid input is mapped to a
<em>distinct</em> index. This property means that there is <em>zero wasted space</em> in the
underlying hash table.</p>
<p>In fact, the foundation of this entire project is the incredible
<a href="https://github.com/sfackler/rust-phf"><code>rust-phf</code></a>, which I ended up heavy
modifying and optimizing for this specific use-case. That said, even without
doing any modifications, the base <code>rust-phf</code> crate results in <strong>~100kb</strong> of
code + data overhead, and can be used on systems without dynamic allocation.</p>
<p>Now, 100kb doesn’t <em>seem</em> that bad, but when you consider that the raw dataset
of shortcodes + emoji is only ~34kb, and the fact that most embedded platforms
I’m targeting have at most ~256kb of flash ROM, it’s should be obvious that
there’s plenty of room for improvement.</p>
<p>Not to spoil the ending, but by using the host of optimizations and data
layout/representation tricks outlined in the next couple sections, that 100kb
number ends up shrinking down to a measly <strong>~20kb!</strong></p>
<h3 id="trick-1---storing-hashes-of--keys--instead-of-the-keys-themselves">Trick 1 - Storing hashes of 🔑 keys 🔑 instead of the keys themselves<a href="#trick-1---storing-hashes-of--keys--instead-of-the-keys-themselves" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>Let’s start off with a guiding question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why do hash tables need to store both values <em>and</em> keys, even in situations
where there’s never a need to iterate over key-value pairs in the map?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This question has a couple different answers, but the one most relevant to this
discussion is that hash tables need a copy of the original key to prevent <em>false
positive lookups</em>, whereby an invalid key returns an unrelated value.</p>
<p>A fundamental property of hash tables is that given a unlimited set of inputs
(i.e: all possible strings), and a limited set of outputs (i.e: the ~2000 emoji
in our data set), a hash collision is essentially guaranteed to happen. As such,
hash tables need to employ some sort of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table#Collision_resolution">collision resolution algorithm</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If hash tables didn’t have any collision resolution, just imagine what sort of
chaos simple input errors might result in! A harmless spelling mistake while
trying to input <code>😄</code>, compounded with some spectacularly bad statistical
chance, somehow results in <code>🍆</code> instead!</p>
<p>Unlikely? Sure. But why even take the chance?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In our case, since we happen to be using a <em>perfect</em> hash function, the conflict
resolution strategy happens to be incredibly simple: just include an
<a href="https://github.com/sfackler/rust-phf/blob/9b70bd9/phf/src/map.rs#L88">additional check</a>
that compares the input key against the expected key at that particular index.
With this one simple trick, the hash table can ensure that invalid inputs are
rejected with 100% certainty!</p>
<p><strong>But enough about how hash functions work in general, we have a problem we want
to solve!</strong></p>
<p>One key insight about our problem is that we are only even interested in
<em>looking up</em> values, and don’t actually care about what the set of valid keys
is.</p>
<p>This begs the question: <strong>Is there any way we could somehow <em>avoid</em> storing all
the keys in their entirety?</strong></p>
<p>At last, we arrive at our first trick: Instead of storing each shortcode key in
its entirety as a raw string (which would take up a <em>lot</em> of space, around
<code>size_of(char*) + 10</code> bytes on average), just store a <strong>small <em>secondary hash</em>
of the key!</strong></p>
<p>This trick results in some absolutely <em>monstrous</em> space savings, cutting the
~18kb of raw shortcode string data down to just <strong>~4kb</strong> (i.e:
<code>size_of(hash("input")) * num_shortcodes</code> bytes, assuming a 16-bit hash).</p>
<hr>
<p>Unfortunately, this trick doesn’t come for free, and brings with it a nasty
side-effect: since the hash function only stores a <em>hash</em> of the key, <strong>the
collision resolution algorithm stops being 100% accurate.</strong> Indeed, the lookup
function ends up having an <em>infinite</em> number of “false positive” inputs 😱</p>
<p>Fortunately, it turns out that it’s possible to greatly reduce the number of
“reasonable” false positives (“reasonable” in the sense that the input isn’t
comprised on random gibberish characters) simply by increasing the number of
bits used for the secondary hash.</p>
<p>Now, I’m no statistician, so I really can’t comment to the theoretical impact of
using more/less bits to reduce false positives, but I can say that though some
extensive empirical testing - both via
<a href="https://github.com/daniel5151/compressed-emoji-shortcodes/tree/main/kowalski-analysis">automated testing</a>
and human trials (read: mashing random keys on my keyboard) - it seems that a
<strong>16-bit hash works almost perfectly</strong>. Heck, if you’re really worried about
space, <strong>even a single byte hash works great!</strong></p>
<p>And don’t just take my word for it - go and play around with the
<a href="https://prilik.com/compressed-emoji-shortcodes">online demo</a> and see how well
this “imperfect” collision resolution algorithm actually works - it ought to be
pretty difficult to find any “reasonable” false positive inputs.</p>

<p>The typical way to store static strings within a map is to store <em>pointers</em> to
the strings, and storing the strings themselves somewhere else in read-only
memory. Unfortunately, in this particular situation, this naive way of storing
strings results in some substantial overhead, as aside from storing the raw
UTF-8 string data for each emoji, we also need to store a pointer to the
string + some way to mark the bounds of a string (either by storing …</p></div></div></div>

A “group” versus “pod”.&nbsp; Some may care deeply about tags for compliance while others may not.</p><figure id="w-node-f4d9d698d04f-0ff58005"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fd1d1ab54430e6b747263b2/6011840533a1c51a66480fcf_7TTT6OvZA1gFtcT3cZNFST0CIogTSyM6nYloYwCJ9OLTM9H3H43bOe4xUNcAdBkdeGNzHnZ7SuGLNqkHDcflYTF9Hrqb-QrW3n1zXqtS3eY6ghP11_8aT44GanEWrTiVXsliqk2A.png" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>The effx microservice catalog allows you to define your taxonomy in code</em></figcaption></figure><p>One team may prioritize dashboards that combine both time-series data and logs into one, while others may have a separate dashboard for each pillar of observability.&nbsp; Runbooks could be a separate entity or a team may have a culture of having that information directly in its alert descriptions.<br></p><p>Every company is different -- and at times, those differences exist on a team level!<br></p><p>A flexible taxonomy for how metadata is described and labeled allows your team to build a microservice catalog that makes sense for your cultural engineering norms, versus fitting a strongly-opinionated structure.<br></p><h2>Portability<br></h2><p>Imagine if you could only use data from another common catalog-like service, Wikipedia … on Wikipedia.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>When developers build systems to send microservice metadata or events into a platform, they expect to be able to also retrieve it to use in their own applications.&nbsp; An API-first microservice catalog is a must.<br></p><p>Once the metadata for a service is aggregated into a single location, the applicability of that data in other platforms is nearly limitless.&nbsp; Source of truth information like service ownership can help drive priorities or roles and responsibilities in other platforms that require it.<br></p><p>Having a well-documented, easy-to-use API that has strong library support and follows common access patterns like REST helps ensure that your platform is both extensible and portable.<br></p><p><a href="https://effxhq.github.io/effx-api-v2/"><strong>Check out our effx API documentation</strong></a><br></p><h2>Accuracy<br></h2><p>In the sales world, folks describe CRMs as only being as useful as the data inside of it.&nbsp; A microservice catalog is no different.<br></p><p>Beyond being appropriately filled out, engineers need to feel confident that the data is up-to-date.&nbsp; A single pane of glass with incorrect information, whether it be broken links or out-of-date data can actually be more harmful than the absence of data.<br></p><p>How does one go about providing an accurate catalog?&nbsp;

January 27, 2021 | https://eugeneyan.com/writing/you-dont-need-another-mooc/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://eugeneyan.com/writing/you-dont-need-another-mooc/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Donâ€™t get me wrong, I love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course" target="_blank">MOOCs</a>. Theyâ€™re great for trying to learn a new programming language (e.g., Python, Scala) or framework (e.g., Spark, TensorFlow) or subject (e.g., statistics, machine learning). The structured learning environment, excellent teaching, and exercises (and solutions) guide us through the best way to learn new concepts.</p>
<p><strong>But most of the time, we donâ€™t really need it.</strong> If we <em>already</em> know machine learning, taking that shiny new MOOC wonâ€™t help with applying it more effectively. Doing another Python tutorial wonâ€™t help with writing better code. Most MOOCs follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle" target="_blank">Pareto Principle</a> and teach students the 20% they need to achieve 80% results. Thus, past the first or second course, our learning tapers off. (Also see Susanâ€™s view on <a href="https://www.susanshu.com/should-i-take-more-online-courses-data-science#rule-of-thumb-diminishing-marginal-returns" target="_blank">diminishing returns</a>.)</p><p>
\[\text { Diminishing returns from similar MOOCs }=1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{16}+\cdots \approx 2\]
</p><p><strong>Sometimes, new MOOCs become a reason to procrastinate, or worse, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-handicapping" target="_blank">self-handicap</a>.</strong> You know this is happening when you hear yourself, or something else, having these thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>â€œIâ€™m not able to start building that <em>until</em> I finish this MOOC specialization.â€�</li>
<li>â€œMy resume isnâ€™t getting picked up <em>because</em> I donâ€™t have certs on Spark &amp; PyTorch.â€�</li>
<li>â€œI havenâ€™t studied enough about deep learning, <em>so</em> I wonâ€™t do well in the interview.â€�</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Watching lecture videos isnâ€™t learningâ€”itâ€™s passive consumption.</strong> We sometimes equate taking an MOOC, or reading a technical book cover to cover, with learning the material. But how often do we struggle when we try to apply the technical knowledge or skills at work? Children donâ€™t learn to ride bicycles via how-to videos. Similarly, we canâ€™t learn how to program or apply technical knowledge just solely watching videos.</p>
<h2 id="go-off-the-happy-path">Go off the happy path</h2>
<p>Most good MOOCs or tutorials will provide hands-on practice. However, that hands-on practice will lie on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_path" target="_blank">happy path</a>. We can copy-paste the code and itâ€™ll work. This makes sense as thereâ€™s a lot of material to cover and we donâ€™t want to spend time debugging, doing prep work, or solving problems via trial and error. Students will lose patience, causing <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/60e90be2-1a77-11e9-b191-175523b59d1d" target="_blank">completion rates to drop</a>.</p>
<p>Being on the happy path makes it easier to complete MOOC after MOOC. However, when we try to apply what weâ€™ve learnedâ€”either at work or on a personal projectâ€”it becomes much harder. This is because weâ€™re <em>now</em> off the happy path. And this is a good thing!</p>
<p><strong>Going off the happy path is how we further our learning <em>beyond the classroom</em>.</strong> This is especially so for our field of data science and machine learning, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Real-world data is messy and dirty, but most MOOCs or YouTube classes start with clean, structured data.</li>
<li>Most of the skills we require are technical. Thus, hands-on coding (read: <a href="https://danluu.com/teach-debugging/" target="_blank">debugging</a>) is essential to master them.</li>
<li>Experimentation is fundamental in our field. We need to try different approaches, fail, and learn beyond what can be practically taught in an MOOC or online tutorial.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>â€œI hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.â€� â€“ Confucius</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>We go off the happy path by doing real-world projects</strong>, dirty data, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cuda+errors" target="_blank">CUDA errors</a>, and all. Through projects, we learn how to define problems, apply algorithms wrongly (and correctly), google error messages, and iterate until it works. We practice resourcefulness, grit, and how to learn. These are the lessons that push us towards excellence.</p>
<p>But, I donâ€™t know enough to start a personal project!</p>
<h2 id="just-in-time-learning">Just-in-time learning</h2>
<p><strong>You just need to know enough to start; the rest youâ€™ll pick up along the way.</strong> We donâ€™t need to know Python <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators" target="_blank">generators</a> before developing your first Python program. We donâ€™t need to know Spark before processing 2 million rows of data. We donâ€™t need to know TensorFlow before training your first machine learning model.</p>
<p><strong>Just start, and let the challenges guide you towards your next learning needs.</strong> This way, you immediately apply what youâ€™ve learned. This reinforces learning, improves retention, and increases satisfaction. Similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_manufacturing" target="_blank">just-in-time</a> manufacturing, just learn whateverâ€™s needed to make progress on your project. Technical skills are perishableâ€”if we donâ€™t apply what we learn, theyâ€™ll decay.</p>
<p><strong>Apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it" target="_blank">YAGNI</a> to learning.</strong> Just like we donâ€™t need to add functionality until itâ€™s required, we donâ€™t need to do every new MOOC or read every new textbook. No point overwhelming ourselves with all that information and knowledge which we wonâ€™t use or apply.</p>
<div>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">How to become expert at thing:<br>1 iteratively take on concrete projects and accomplish them depth wise, learning â€œon demandâ€� (ie donâ€™t learn bottom up breadth wise)<br>2 teach/summarize everything you learn in your own words<br>3 only compare yourself to younger you, never to others</p>— Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy) <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1325154823856033793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 7, 2020</a></blockquote> 
</div>
<p>To be clear, Iâ€™m not saying that we should stop exploring and learning new things. Iâ€™m saying that we should lean towards being more focused.</p>
<p>When learning about new domains, subjects, or skills, adopt a childlike <em>exploratory</em> mindset. Donâ€™t concern ourselves with the practicality of what we learn. However, if our intent is mastery, we should adopt a <em>focused</em> mindset and learn via hands-on projects, mistakes, and feedback.</p>
<h2 id="but-but-here-are-my-reasons-for-_____">But, butâ€¦ here are my reasons for _____</h2>
<p>I often get pushback when I suggest doing a personal project instead of another MOOC, Kaggle, or further education. Hereâ€™s how some conversations go:</p>
<p><strong>â€œIâ€™m very time-constrained and donâ€™t have time for a personal project. MOOCs are self-contained and need only 2-4 hours a weekâ€�</strong></p>
<p>Yes, MOOCs are great return on time-invested for getting up to speed on a subject. But past a certain threshold of knowledge and understanding, youâ€™re going to need hands-on practice to take your learning further. AFAIK, projects are the best way to do this.</p>
<p><strong>â€�I tried doing a personal project in the past. But I got a lot of errors and had to google a lotâ€”I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m ready for them until I do more MOOCs.â€�</strong></p>
<p>Getting errors and googling for help is perfectly normal! Even the instructors who created those MOOCs do that too. Thatâ€™s how we learnâ€”by trying, failing, and overcoming.</p>
<p><strong>â€�Personal projects are too difficult. Taking an MOOC is easier.â€�</strong></p>
<p>Thatâ€™s exactly why you need to do a personal project. The difficulty you experience is the learning curveâ€”without it, thereâ€™s no learning.</p>
<p>MOOCs <em>feel</em> easier because their tutorials and assignments are structured to follow the happy path. But this means youâ€™re deliberately steered away from the hairy issues that youâ€™ll face in the real world, unlike in a personal project.</p>
<p><img src="https://eugeneyan.com/assets/mooc-jackie.jpg" loading="lazy" title="Why I can't serve ML models?!" alt="Why I can't serve ML models?!"></p>
<p><strong>â€�Doing that MOOC/Masters gives me a certificate that helps my resume.â€�</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps. Nonetheless, companies are placing <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/16/15-companies-that-no-longer-require-employees-to-have-a-college-degree.html" target="_blank">less emphasis on educational qualifications</a>, even for technical roles. Recruiters and hiring managers are also becoming more open-minded. And in the end, from a hiring managerâ€™s perspective, what <em>really</em> counts is if you can do the work, not that cert.</p>
<p><strong>â€�The recruiter said I would be tested on technical skills and knowledge. Thus, I need to do more technical MOOCs.â€�</strong></p>
<p>To an extent, MOOCs and YouTube videos are helpful, especially for questions that test your knowledge (read: memory) or require you to know the trick (e.g., leetcode type questions).</p>
<p>However, for most interviews, youâ€™ll likely get more nebulous tasks, like designing a data pipeline, whiteboarding a machine learning API, or coding up a basic k-nearest neighbors or decision tree. These assess your ability to design and develop maintainable systems, think through edge cases, and adapt based on feedback. The hands-on practice from projects will be more helpful in such interviews</p>
<p><img src="https://eugeneyan.com/assets/interview-board.jpg" loading="lazy" title="Lets just focus on the easy questions" alt="Lets just focus on the easy questions"></p>
<p><strong>â€�What personal project should I do?â€�</strong></p>
<p>Start with something youâ€™re interested in. If youâ€™re not intrinsically interested in it, you might find difficulty finishing.</p>
<p>Aim for something you can complete over the weekends in 12 weeks, ideally, 6 - 8 weeks. Any longer and it wonâ€™t seem urgent enough (and youâ€™ll lose momentum).</p>
<p><strong>â€�Iâ€™m familiar with web scraping/ruby/excel, can my personal project be about that?â€�</strong></p>
<p>Sure. Just start somewhere and evolve it along the way.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, if youâ€™re doing a personal project to learn, youâ€™ll probably want to deliberately pick something new and unfamiliar. Or if youâ€™re doing a personal project to build your portfolio (and get a job), youâ€™ll want to look over the job requirements to make sure you address them.</p>
<p><strong>â€�But, I canâ€™t think of any interesting personal projects!â€�</strong></p>
<p>Look back on the classes and material youâ€™ve covered. Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll find something interesting that youâ€™ll want to dig deeper into.</p>
<p>This is also a good test of whether youâ€™re interested in a discipline. If you canâ€™t think of a personal project that interests you, do you <em>really</em> want it for a career? (And the answer might be yes, for various reasons such as compensation, prestige, etc.)</p>
<p><img src="https://eugeneyan.com/assets/project-drake.jpg" loading="lazy" title="Do a personal project? Nah..." alt="Do a personal project? Nah..."></p>
<p><strong>â€�Other than personal projects, anything else you would recommend?â€�</strong></p>
<p>Nope. My <em>sole</em> recommendation is to start a personal project and learn whatever you need to complete it.</p>
<p>â€¢ â€¢ â€¢</p>
<p>In 2021, instead of taking that MOOC or watching another YouTube machine learning playlist, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning-by-doing" target="_blank">learn by doing</a> instead.</p>
<p>Learning a programming language? Build an app, any app. Share it online and get feedback. Iterate and add new features. Learning a new machine learning technique? Find some novel data and apply it. Understand where it fails, where it shines, and how to adapt it for different data sets. Share your findings via writing online or at a meetup.</p>
<p>Learning comes from doing. Not watching videos, or reading textbooks. Start doing now.</p>

And often, those electric vehicles are being charged at home.</p>  <p>Most of the electricity generated by North American grids has some greenhouse gas emissions connected to it. So even if a car isn't belching carbon, it doesn't mean it's perfectly clean.</p>  <p>For instance, coal is about the dirtiest way to generate electricity to recharge a car battery. Powering an EV with electricity generated from coal is marginally better than burning gasoline in an internal-combustion engine, according to numbers compiled by Jennifer Dunn at Northwestern University's Center for Engineering Sustainability and Resilience.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5396097.1576270362!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/ghg-emissions-by-vehicles.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5396097.1576270362!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/ghg-emissions-by-vehicles.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5396097.1576270362!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/ghg-emissions-by-vehicles.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5396097.1576270362!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/ghg-emissions-by-vehicles.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5396097.1576270362!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/ghg-emissions-by-vehicles.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5396097.1576270362!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/ghg-emissions-by-vehicles.jpg"></p></div></figure></span></p>  <p>Most North American grids are composed of a mix of generating sources, from coal to hydro to nuclear, though Canada has pledged to eliminate coal-burning plants by 2030. When that mix is taken into account, charging a car generally creates less than half the carbon emissions compared to gasoline, according to Dunn.</p>  <p>It's only when electricity comes from clean, renewable sources like wind and solar that you see the most pronounced drop in EV emissions generated to power the car.</p>  <h2>Where does your battery come from?</h2>  <p>Before an electric vehicle even charges for the first time, however, one key part of its power system already has a significant carbon footprint.</p>  <p>"One really important aspect of an EV to think about is its battery," explains Dunn.</p>  <p>"For example, the material that helps power the battery is produced from a number of different metals, things like nickel and cobalt and lithium."</p>    <p>Mining and processing the minerals, plus the battery manufacturing process, involve substantial emissions of carbon.</p>  <p>Lithium mining, needed to build the lithium ion batteries at the heart of today's EVs, has also been connected to other kinds of environmental harm. There have been mass fish kills related to lithium mining in Tibet, for example. The freshwater supply is being consumed by mines in South America's lithium-rich region. Even in North America, where mining regulations are strict, harsh chemicals are used to extract the valuable metal.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5399271.1576601860!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/rockwood-lithium-plant.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5399271.1576601860!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/rockwood-lithium-plant.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5399271.1576601860!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/rockwood-lithium-plant.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5399271.1576601860!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/rockwood-lithium-plant.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5399271.1576601860!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/rockwood-lithium-plant.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5399271.1576601860!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/rockwood-lithium-plant.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>An aerial view of the brine pools and processing areas of the Rockwood lithium plant on the Atacama salt flat in northern Chile, the largest lithium deposit currently in production.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Ivan Alvarado/Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>And all the operations are energy intensive, sometimes running on diesel generators and relying on carbon-emitting heavy machinery.</p>  <p>Adding to the cumulative effects on the environment, lithium demand is expected to at least triple by 2025, pushing more exploration and extraction globally.</p>  <h2>Second life for lithium-ion batteries&nbsp;</h2>  <p>And all that extracted raw material —&nbsp;once the batteries are worn out —&nbsp;will land somewhere.</p>  <p>It's something Andrew MacDonald at Maritime Autoparts in Debert, N.S., is thinking about.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Overview</h2><p>Accuracy is the most important characteristic of a speech recognition system. While AssemblyAI’s production end-to-end approach for speech recognition is able to provide better accuracy than other commercial grade speech recognition systems, improvements could still be made to achieve human performance. As part of our core research and development efforts to continue pushing the state of the art of speech recognition accuracy, in this post, we explore speech recognition architectures that are gaining new popularity in both research and industry settings.</p><h2>1. Introduction<br></h2><p>As we continue our core research and development efforts to push the boundaries of state of the art accuracy, we begin exploring architectures for end-to-end speech recognition that are gaining relative new popularity, not only in the research domain but also in production settings in industry ([1], [2]). We are specially interested in architectures that have shown production level accuracy matching or surpassing that of conventional hybrid DNN-HMM ([3], [4]) speech recognition systems. With that in mind, we survey the following two architectures: Listen Attend and Spell (LAS, [5]), and Recurrent Neural Network Transducers (RNNT, [6]).</p><p>We survey these new architectures from a production perspective. In section 2, we report on accuracy comparisons from some of the latest research done on both LAS and RNNT ([7], [8], [2]). We also do a comparison of these techniques against Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC, [9]) ([7], [1]), which is a more widely known end-to-end approach, and is what early versions of AssemblyAI’s <a href="https://www.assemblyai.com/">speech recognition system</a> was based on. We also a look at recent research that combines RNNT and LAS into a single system ([8], [2]).</p><p>In section 3, keeping our focus on production grade speech recognition, we compare LAS and RNNT models from the perspective of feature parity. We focus on contextualization ([10], [1]), inverse text normalization ([11], [1], [8]), word timestamps, and the possibility of doing real time speech recognition ([1], [2]).</p><p>And we finish this post in section 4, with high level conclusions about our survey as well as next steps for future blog posts.</p><h2>2. Accuracy<br></h2><p>While human parity speech recognition accuracy has been reached for some research data sets ([12]), word error rates (WER) for industrial production grade applications in challenging acoustic environments is far from human level. One example of such domain is spontaneous telephone conversations, where, even in research datasets, human level parity has not yet been achieved ([13]).</p><p>We set our focus in this section on LAS and RNNT systems tested on production data, and not on research datasets. We avoid looking into research datasets as they are easily overfit by models that do not generalize well to real live audio signals. We want to keep our focus on datasets that contain challenging characteristics such as channel noise, compression, ambient noise, crosstalk, accents and speaker diversity.</p><h3>2.1 LAS vs RNNT<br></h3><p>When comparing accuracy of LAS and RNNT based architectures, the consensus seems to be that LAS has better accuracy than RNNT. [7] compares both LAS and RNNT models using 12500 hours of production voice-search traffic, artificially distorted by adding noise and by simulating room acoustics. WER is reported on both dictation as well as voice search utterances. Both LAS and RNNT use the same encoder neural network architecture and size. Their parameters however, are different and were initialized to those of a converged CTC trained network with the same encoder architecture. The decoders also have the same architecture, same number of layers, size and output the set of 26 lower case letters plus numerals, space and punctuation symbols. As a result, the only difference in terms of numbers of parameters lies in the RNNT joint network and the LAS attention mechanism. Neither the LAS nor the RNNT model use any sort of external language model. Table <a href="#">1</a> summarizes their results showing LAS performing better in general.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fbd459f3b05914cf70496d7/601023b3c2415b14faf3fee3_Screen%20Shot%202021-01-26%20at%208.13.59%20AM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Table 1:&nbsp;Accuracy of RNNT vs LAS</figcaption></figure><p>[8] also shows LAS performing better in general. They emphasize RNNT models lag in quality while LAS shows competitive performance when compared to hybrid DNN-HMM models ([11]). [8] also compares the WERs of LAS with RNNT. Similar to [7], the encoder and decoder networks are the same for both RNNT and LAS, differing only on the joint and attention networks. Both predict outputs from a set of 4096 word pieces. The training data used is the same for both models and consists of 30,000 hours of voice search training data, corrupted with added noise and room acoustics. The models are tested on two test sets: one made of utterances shorter than 5.5 seconds (Short Utts.) and another one made of utterances longer than 5.5 seconds (Long Utts.). Results showing LAS performing better can be seen in table 1. LAS shows degrading accuracy on long utterances, which is attributed to the attention mechanism as explained in [14].</p><p>While [2] does not explicitly compare the accuracy rates of LAS and RNNT models, they do mention, similar to [8], that under low latency constraints the accuracy of LAS outperforms conventional DNN-HMM models, while RNNT models do not.</p><h3>2.2 LAS and RNNT vs CTC<br></h3><p>Comparisons with <a href="https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/end-to-end-speech-recognition-pytorch">CTC based models</a> are not as simple as comparisons just between LAS and RNNT. The main reason being that a CTC model is highly dependent on the use of an external language model to have acceptable accuracy. LAS and RNNT models do not need an external language model due to the existence of a decoder component in the model.</p><p>[7] compares LAS, RNNT and CTC models without any external LM, where the encoder architecture and size is the same across all three models. CTC’s accuracy without any external LM, which is shown in table 2, is significantly lower than RNNT and LAS. The rest of the experimental details are the same as those described section 2.1.</p><p>[1] compares RNNT and CTC, but with significant differences in each architecture. The CTC model consists of 6 LSTM layers with each layer having 1200 cells and a 400 dimensional projection layer. The model outputs 42 phoneme targets through a softmax layer. Decoding is preformed with a 5gram first pass language model and a second pass LSTM LM rescoring model. The RNNT model’s encoder consists of 8 LSTM layers with 2048 cells each and a 640 dimensional projection layer. A time reduction layer of factor 2 is inserted after the second layer of the encoder. The prediction network has 2 LSTM layers each with 2048 cels and a 640 dimensional projection layer. The joint network has 640 hidden units. The output layer models 4096 word pieces. The size of the RNNT model is 120MB, while the size of the CTC model is 130MB.</p><p>[1] performs training with 27500 hours of voice search and dictation data, artificially corrupted to simulate room acoustics and noise. Table 2 shows the comparison between their CTC and RNNT models on both a voice search and a dictation test sets, showing the RNNT model being significantly better.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fbd459f3b05914cf70496d7/6010241853756e7b2a8e4771_Screen%20Shot%202021-01-26%20at%208.15.41%20AM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Table 2:&nbsp;Accuracy of RNNT and LAS&nbsp;vs CTC</figcaption></figure><h3>2.3 Combining LAS and RNNT<br></h3><p>While LAS is perceived as having better accuracy, RNNT models are perceived to have production quality features, such as streaming capabilities, that make them more desirable.</p><p>With the objective of bridging the accuracy gap between both architectures, [8] and [2] develop a combination of RNNT and LAS models. RNNT is used during first pass decoding, and LAS is used as a second pass rescoring model.</p><p>The experimental details of [8] with respect to separate RNNT and LAS models are described in section 2.1. The two pass experiments use the same architecture for both and LAS and RNNT. The number of parameters are the same as well but this time the encoder parameters are shared between them. Training is done in three steps. First an RNNT model is converged. Then the RNNT encoder is frozen and a LAS decoder is trained with it. Finally a combined loss is used to retrain both the RNNT and LAS models (with a shared encoder) together. Table <a href="#">3</a> shows the rescoring approach significantly improves the accuracy of the RNNT model. It also improves the LAS weakness with respect to longer utterances.</p><p>[2] also implements LAS rescoring on a second pass, where the first pass is an RNNT model. Besides using search data during training they also use data from multiple other domains (e.g.: far field, phone) and accented speech from countries other than the U.S. The number of hours used for training is not specified, but the model architecture details related to LAS rescoring are similar: A shared encoder is used between the RNNT model and the LAS model, and the LAS model is used to rescore hypotheses coming from the RNNT model. They add an additional LAS encoder layer in between the shared encoder and the LAS decoder. Table 3 shows that LAS rescoring significantly improves RNNT accuracy.</p><p>More importantly, table 3 shows the combination of RNNT and LAS beating a conventional HMM-RNN hybrid model. The acoustic model of the conventional model outputs context dependent phones, and uses a phonetic dictionary with close to 800,000 words. A 5-gram language model is used during first pass decoding and a MaxEnt language model is used for second pass rescoring. The total size of the conventional model is around 87 GBs. The RNNT+LASS model’s size is 0.18 GBs. The RNNT model has 120 million parameters and the LAS model (both the additional encoder and the decoder) have 57 million additional parameters. Parameters are quantized to be 8bit fixed point.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fbd459f3b05914cf70496d7/6010247b5c33d430166ed715_Screen%20Shot%202021-01-26%20at%208.17.06%20AM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Table 3:&nbsp;Accuracy of RNNT and&nbsp;LAS&nbsp;rescoring</figcaption></figure><h2>3. Feature Parity<br></h2><p>While accuracy is the most important characteristic of a speech recognition system, there are many other features that contribute to usability and cost. In this section we explore LAS and RNNT from the perspective of features such as contextualization, inverse text normalization, timestamps and real time speech recognition.<br></p><h3>3.1 Contextualization<br></h3><p>The words …</p></div></div>

<p>One morning a few weeks ago, we woke up to excited messages from friends telling us that our website, <a href="https://sidehustlestack.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Side Hustle Stack</a>, had appeared on their TikTok For You Page. That video led to hundreds of thousands of pageviews per minute, crashing our site in the middle of the night.</p>



<p>The surprise? We hadn’t actually created any content on TikTok. The flood of traffic was driven by a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@alexcazam/video/6907067263535320326" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video</a> created by <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@alexcazam/video/6907067263535320326?_d=secCgsIARCbDRgBIAMoARI%2BCjz16CzfQZDnuVFO5P7oyX%2FO2bJ%2B%2Fw2rH98MHZG%2BGs0HXlI0Yt%2BGo1ObeRVjkOnblekXA1asv%2BLYyKcVziwaAA%3D%3D&amp;language=en&amp;preview_pb=0&amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAtbN000KPBvmJn60GeGUqH5Hni4_Jv5RisXXmYGJyyK0MTquqlPHKwjhVpmKF90E_&amp;share_item_id=6907067263535320326&amp;share_link_id=21FDAEFA-F555-4AF7-9D01-B8425CA44C50&amp;timestamp=1608227611&amp;tt_from=sms&amp;u_code=dfa2fifm696gmf&amp;user_id=6890831503513994242&amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;utm_source=sms&amp;source=h5_m&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;sender_web_id=6899548486124635654&amp;is_from_webapp=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@alexcazam</a>, a 19 year-old college student that none of us knew, who had stumbled across the site. In the weeks afterwards, her TikTok has surpassed 5 million views.</p>



<p>Before this, we had tried other strategies for driving distribution—press outreach and launching on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/side-hustle-stack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Product Hunt</a> where we got over 600 upvotes—but none of these tactics came close to approaching the success of a single viral TikTok video.</p>



<p>We quickly realized: <strong><strong>businesses that figure out how to leverage TikTok will have an advantage in building brand awareness, cultivating user trust, and efficiently acquiring customers.</strong></strong></p>



<p>Since that day, our initial viral boost has led to a stable, high level of traffic to the site, and in parallel, we’ve gone down a rabbit hole to better understand how startups can best leverage TikTok. That includes surveying the <a href="https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1343699470358294528" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitterverse</a>, diving deep and interviewing creators and brands, and creating an account of our own (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sidehustlestack?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@sidehustlestack</a>, which has grown to 14K followers in &lt;2 weeks).</p>



<p>The following is a summary of what we’ve learned so far. Note that while we this piece can help guide your TikTok strategy, it should be taken with a grain of salt: the platform is ever-evolving and requires constant experimentation. Our plan is to update these learnings on a continual basis.</p>



<h2>What are the best uses of TikTok for startups?</h2>



<p>Despite being best known for viral dances, lip sync videos, and other challenges popular among Gen Z, TikTok has exploded in mass appeal, and now counts a broad swath of the population in its exponentially growing user base. As of June 2020, TikTok had around 50 million daily active users and 92 million monthly active users in the US, up nearly 800% from January 2018. The average US user opens the app 8 times a day and spends 46 minutes per day on the app.</p>



<p>For startups, TikTok can be a goldmine for growth. The app is designed with a <a href="https://li.substack.com/p/building-the-middle-class-of-the">level playing field</a> that enables newcomers to quickly grow and go viral. Unlike more established social networks that reward users with already-accrued status, TikTok’s For You Page and personalization algorithm purposefully surfaces videos from even little-known accounts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Businesses of all sizes have seen success on TikTok. On one hand, there’s Netflix, which amassed 12 million followers in a little over a year by leaning into trends and creating entertaining highlights. Then there are small businesses like <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pouncecatcafe?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pounce Cat Cafe</a> which has made viral videos and cultivated a community on the platform, leading to over 1,700 cat adoptions.</p>



<p>There is no one-size-fits-all strategy for businesses looking to succeed on TikTok: anything from a low-effort iPhone clip to a fully staged and edited promotion can go viral. That makes it great for startups who are strapped for cash but can bring a lot of fun and passion. </p>



<p>There are a few areas where TikTok really excels for startups:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Building user trust and buy-in</strong></li><li><strong>Driving awareness of new products and services</strong></li><li><strong>Creating buzz around a category</strong></li><li><strong>Getting user feedback and creating a two-way dialogue</strong></li></ol>



<p>Let’s dive in to each:</p>



<h3>1. Building user trust and buy-in&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Because TikTok is video-based, it’s naturally conducive to storytelling and showcasing a more multifaceted narrative instead of simply shilling products. Brands can show off their authenticity in a more raw, unpolished way and promote trust with the audience. </p>



<p>Creators have told us that the less commercial-like and more word-of-mouth-like, the better. The best content feels like something your best friend might share with you.</p>



<p>For startups, there’s a built-in advantage for generating trust and buy-in on TikTok: most founders are truly passionate about what they’re building. Showing that authenticity, excitement, and passion can help make users feel bought into your success and want to support your journey.</p>



<p>Pre-launch, startups can create anticipation by talking about the context and story behind an idea. Companies can direct those fans to sign up for a mailing list or be added to a waitlist. When companies launch, there’s a built-in set of fans ready to evangelize a product.</p>



<p>New dating app <a href="https://monet.world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monet</a>’s beta launch on TikTok is a perfect example of generating user trust and creating hype. The launch video introduces users to the team behind the app and explains their journey, from first identifying the problem to building out a solution. There are fun, personal anecdotes: the team living together, going on hikes, and making dinner. Gen Z viewers come away excited by the product and rooting for the team’s success.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><figcaption><em><strong>Monet’s beta launch video on co-founder Joanna Shan’s personal account (</strong></em><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@joanna.shan?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgowZGu5wFeWdpLiXlNz79KgY%2B8L%2FWjJY7VAqOInxayeH8enBubowpHHmR22lais8%2FJuGgA%3D&amp;language=en&amp;preview_pb=0&amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAtbN000KPBvmJn60GeGUqH5Hni4_Jv5RisXXmYGJyyK0MTquqlPHKwjhVpmKF90E_&amp;share_item_id=6883220655790181638&amp;share_link_id=4BC4467C-6803-47CA-A5EB-3D196A3E6BE9&amp;timestamp=1609630388&amp;tt_from=copy&amp;u_code=dfa2fifm696gmf&amp;user_id=6890831503513994242&amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;utm_source=copy&amp;source=h5_m&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;sender_web_id=6899548486124635654&amp;is_from_webapp=v1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>@joanna.shan</em></strong></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Subscription-splitting startup <a href="https://www.tabtabapp.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TabTab</a> (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@victordanielcarde?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgowjzoxpQDv7bI%2F0y72yWTNElljZT3kYk7cbn07afvx047Y%2BwnmgzQ3R2qB7PD2iOBdGgA%3D&amp;language=en&amp;preview_pb=0&amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAtbN000KPBvmJn60GeGUqH5Hni4_Jv5RisXXmYGJyyK0MTquqlPHKwjhVpmKF90E_&amp;share_item_id=6900817950551411974&amp;share_link_id=9C5AB4A4-7893-4876-B575-1BD4E3185BA8&amp;timestamp=1609631222&amp;tt_from=copy&amp;u_code=dfa2fifm696gmf&amp;user_id=6890831503513994242&amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;utm_source=copy&amp;source=h5_m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@victordanielcarde</a>) and friend-finding app <a href="https://www.flox.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flox</a> (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jamietylerlee?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgowNLx7RH%2BJk5hafXlCBSq8cpSzUXPd%2FHXWkQ2DL6O9jI7pTosXlusUDUn2Fc5dgKSOGgA%3D&amp;language=en&amp;preview_pb=0&amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAtbN000KPBvmJn60GeGUqH5Hni4_Jv5RisXXmYGJyyK0MTquqlPHKwjhVpmKF90E_&amp;share_item_id=6905238996863962374&amp;share_link_id=84868AFD-D169-45FA-B597-7A103E0C7568&amp;timestamp=1609630632&amp;tt_from=copy&amp;u_code=dfa2fifm696gmf&amp;user_id=6890831503513994242&amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;utm_source=copy&amp;source=h5_m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@jamietylerlee</a>) have both found success by employing similar TikTok strategies as Monet.</p>



<figure><figcaption><strong><em>TabTab’s launch video on founder Victor Daniel Carden’s personal account.</em></strong></figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption><strong><em>Flox’s waitlist launch video on founder Jamie Lee’s personal account.</em></strong></figcaption></figure>



<h3>2. Driving awareness of new products and services</h3>



<p>From our own survey of 100+ Gen Zers, over half of TikTok users have downloaded an app or visited a website they discovered through the app, and more than one-third have purchased a product.</p>



<p>Companies can use TikTok to show off their products in a way that doesn’t feel overly commercial or transactional. Think: cool demo videos, product walk-throughs, tutorials, and other information that can be conveyed visually.</p>



<p>Consumer research suggests that more than 51% of consumers trust other posts by real people than those created by brands. TikTok benefits from built-in social proof, through comments, dueting, stitching, and other users creating videos about products. If other users are raving about how cool something is, users are more likely to trust it. </p>



<p>Ephemeral messaging app <a href="https://honk.me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Honk</a> (<a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZS7oxQvF/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@usehonk</a>) shows off their product in a way that speaks to the <a href="http://culture.affinitymagazine.us/the-isolation-absurdity-of-gen-z-humor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">absurdity</a> of Gen Z humor:&nbsp;full of non-sequiturs, Monke memes, and astrology.</p>



<p>Our takeaway? The more ridiculous and Gen Z the humor, the better.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><figcaption><strong><em>Honk’s Launch Video on TikTok received 1.2M views.</em></strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>Breathing app <a href="https://www.breathwrk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Breathwrk</a> (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@breathwrk?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@Breathwrk</a>) makes their visual breathing exercises a part of the TikTok experience.&nbsp;The account, which has amassed over 1.5M followers and 18.6M likes, consistently interacts with users and creates content in response to comments.</p>



<figure><figcaption><strong><em>Breathwrk breathing exercise for migraines received 374K likes.</em></strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>For an example of a brand leveraging TikTok to drive product purchases, take a look at <a href="https://aavia.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aavia</a>‘s (<a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZS7omoMu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@aavia.io</a>) account. By combining a trending sound and demos that show off the coolest features, their videos get consistently high viewership.</p>



<figure><figcaption><strong><em>Aavia’s product demo received 1.3M views.</em></strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>Though virality on TikTok may be short-lived, it’s often accompanied by significant follower growth, which, over time, translates to more viral videos. And while consistently posting new content is key, the best TikToks are evergreen and can continue to attract viewers long after they were initially posted.</p>



<p>Remember: the people you’re reaching on TikTok will reflect the demographics of the app. That means consumer-friendly products are more well-suited to TikTok than, say, something related to enterprise apps (except for Notion, which seems to be having a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215782/tiktok-notion-enterprise-software-teen-studyblr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moment</a>).</p>



<h3>3. Creating buzz around a category</h3>



<p>TikTok’s algorithm surfaces content — however niche — that users may find interesting. That means it’s a great place to create buzz around an entire category or educate users regarding a certain topic. Once users are interested in your category, companies can suggest related products/services that users are likely to be interested in.</p>



<p>Users often refer to these niches as which “<a href="https://www.bustle.com/life/sides-of-tiktok" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">side</a>” of TikTok they are on — Alt TikTok, NostalgiaTok, FoodieTok, straight TikTok, BookTok, FrogTok, you name it. Scroll through the “How to Go Viral on TikTok” side (yes, it’s a category of its own!) and you’ll see countless mentions of the importance of finding your niche. Owning a niche and continuing to create content for it over time will translate into a base of educated users who are actively invested in that particular topic.</p>



<p>Some great creator-led business examples are <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@smallbusinesstips_?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@smallbusinesstips_ </a>and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pricelesstay?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@pricelesstay</a>, both of whom have cultivated and grown their audiences by refining their content to focus on niches like small business advice and Gen Z financial literacy, respectively.</p>



<p>Sneakerhead app <a href="https://getplugd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Plugd</a>’s (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@get.plugd?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@get.plugd</a>) audience growth reflects their success in carving out a following among sneakerheads.&nbsp;By creating content around this category (like how to spot fake sneakers), they’ve used TikTok to drive top-of-funnel awareness before pushing users to the app itself.</p>



<figure><figcaption><strong><em>Plugd’s video helping users identify fake sneakers received 500K+ views.</em></strong></figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="http://copy.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CopyAI</a> (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@copy.ai?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@copy.ai</a>) has carved out a niche in the in the small business vertical, with consistent content about starting side hustles and ways that its product can make entrepreneurs’ lives easier.</p>



<figure><figcaption><strong><em>A recent CopyAI TikTok exploring e-commerce trends for 2021.</em></strong></figcaption></figure>



<h3>4. Getting user feedback and creating a two-way dialogue</h3>



<p>Because discovery on TikTok is primarily driven through the For You Page, a video that gains traction is a clear indication that users have excitement for its content. That means creating content on TikTok is a great, lightweight way to test ideas: before even building out a product, startups can gauge reception to a concept via TikTok.</p>



<p>TikTok is also a treasure trove of user insights. The <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/the-comments-are-now-the-best-part-of-tiktok-78c624d51141" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comments section</a> resembles no …</p></div></article></div>

These questions can range from simple customer support queries ("Does user X have the right plan?") to evaluating KPI's and growth metrics ("How many users signed up in the last month and what percent of those converted to paid?") to the more open-ended ("How much revenue will we have in 12 months?").</span></span></p><div id="block-3e9cd828f5334adda85fdbfb4b4cc69a"><div id="block-71f39a4ef039454287b8caa8e53eea89"><p><span><span>To make my job easier, I try to automate as many of these questions as I can. My company, </span><span><a href="https://seekwell.io/blog-gpt3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SeekWell</a></span><span>, builds awesome tools to help with this, like a unified team SQL repository and seamless scheduling of queries, reports, and alerts. Many things, though, like actually writing SQL code, are difficult to automateâ€”or at least have been. </span></span></p></div><div id="block-05f0094e96104a55b608aecb7c35791b"><div id="block-fd67e43c00754a16b725e54946093bb4"><p><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/blog.seekwell.io/74a62dc5-b3f1-45ba-a090-36e1f21cd166.gif" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto" objectfit="contain" objectposition="center" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div><h3 id="block-f0f41f92c9ed46f88da1c7319c105013"><span id="f0f41f92c9ed46f88da1c7319c105013"></span><span><span>Enter GPT-3</span></span></h3><p><span><span><a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Openai</a></span><span>'s </span><span><a href="https://beta.openai.com/docs/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPT-3</a></span><span> is starting to break the conventional wisdom of what tasks can and can't be automated. At the most basic level, GPT-3 is a text-completion engine, trained on huge swaths of the internet. It takes inputted text and returns the text that it thinks would appear next. Many have already used it to generate HTML and CSS </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1282676454690451457?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">code</a></span><span> from specific design instructions. Others have made </span><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/16/21371049/gpt3-hacker-news-ai-blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#1 trending blog posts</a></span><span> generated mostly by GPT-3 with some creative prompts.</span></span></p><p><span><span>In my case, since so much of my job is writing SQL, I want to be able to describe a question in plain English and have GPT-3 convert it into the SQL code that, if executed on my Postgres database, would answer the question. </span></span></p><p><span><span>To accomplish this, I found more success using </span><span><a href="https://beta.openai.com/docs/engines/the-instruct-series-beta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPT-3 Instruct</a></span><span> (still in beta) than the more generalized GPT-3 engines. GPT-3 Instruct (in particular,</span><span><a href="https://beta.openai.com/playground?model=davinci-instruct-beta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> davinci-instruct</a></span><span>) lets you give specific instructions, like "Only respond in correct SQL syntax", that guides GPT-3's responses. If you're interested in trying it out, you can sign up for the waitlist for the GPT-3 API </span><span><a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1Lfc7WtPLRk2ppXhPjcYY-A4sk30" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></span><span>. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Below, I'll detail my experience with the API. In each example, I'll include a gif of asking GPT-3 a question. Below the gif will be the input question (generated by me, in green) and GPT-3's response translating it into SQL (generated by GPT-3, in blue). I'll also include my instructions to GPT-3 (in yellow) and examples I fed GPT-3 (in orange). </span></span></p><p><span><span>Here's the first instruction I gave it, a question, and the response from GPT-3:</span></span></p><div id="block-48ecab24b59a4404bae7f20fb8caf501"><p><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/blog.seekwell.io/d99a5fe5-1ca9-43f2-a233-818d878160ac.gif" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto" objectfit="contain" objectposition="center" loading="lazy"></p></div><p><span><span><strong>Instruction:</strong></span><span> Given an input question, respond with syntactically correct PostgreSQL. Be creative but the SQL must be correct.</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> how many users signed up in the past month?</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>GPT-3 Response: </strong></span><span>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users
WHERE signup_time &gt; now() - interval '1 month'</span></span></p><p><span><span>Woah. I never gave it my database schema but it assumes I have a table called "users" (which is accurate) and that there's a timestamp field called "signup_time" for when a user signed up. Pretty logical. It also knew the correct way to subtract a month from today's date in PostgreSQL (now() - interval '1 month') without seeing an example. Pretty cool!</span></span></p><p><span><span>To give GPT-3 a little more context, I'll add information about my database schema to the instruction. My new Instruction: </span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Instruction:</strong></span><span> Given an input question, respond with syntactically correct PostgreSQL. Be creative but the SQL must be correct. Only use tables called "users" and "charges". The "users" table has columns: id (integer), signup_dt (timestamp), email (character varying), and plan_type (character varying). The "charges" table has columns: amount (bigint), user_id (integer), and charge_dt (timestamp).</span></span></p><p><span><span>Now I'll try asking another question, and see if GPT-3 can respond based on my actual database:</span></span></p><div id="block-a4da842d10ee45bdaee9837e612a0afb"><p><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/blog.seekwell.io/85ecbb57-3212-4ebd-8d13-534d98573a64.gif" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto" objectfit="contain" objectposition="center" loading="lazy"></p></div><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> how much revenue did we have in the past 7 days?</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>GPT-3 Response:</strong></span><span> SELECT SUM(amount) FROM charges WHERE charge_dt &gt; now() - interval '7 days'</span></span></p><p><span><span>Nice. I gave it a little more information on the tables and columns in my database, and it correctly inferred that "amount" = "revenue" and knew to SUM() that amount for the past 7 days of charges to answer the question. Clearly, it already knows some basic SQL syntax, and can make inferences about what I mean.</span></span></p><h3 id="block-77e3952dbf77411c987d2139118a5c14"><span id="77e3952dbf77411c987d2139118a5c14"></span><span><span>Priming GPT-3 with examples</span></span></h3><p><span><span>I'll try another question but first it might make sense to explicitly tell GPT-3 the columns in my tables via a simple example. Examples are a great way to give GPT-3 context and flesh out subtleties that might not be obvious in just an instruction. I found this helpful for really hammering into it which columns and tables are eligible to use (GPT-3 sometimes likes to "invent" columns to make answering the question easier). Here are the examples I added to the prompt:</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> select all available columns from users table.
</span><span><strong>Output:</strong></span><span> SELECT id, signup_dt, email, plan_type FROM users</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> select all available columns from charges table.
</span><span><strong>Output:</strong></span><span> SELECT amount, user_id, and charge_dt FROM charges</span></span></p><p><span><span>Now with those examples fed to GPT-3, I'll ask another question:</span></span></p><div id="block-58c943723b154475bf698435c315d98d"><p><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/blog.seekwell.io/b349a134-f123-4451-bee0-b1ab88b3a3dc.gif" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto" objectfit="contain" objectposition="center" loading="lazy"></p></div><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> what was the largest payment amount made in the past 30 days?</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>GPT-3 Response:</strong></span><span> SELECT MAX(amount) FROM charges WHERE charge_dt &gt; NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'</span></span></p><p><span><span>It knew to use MAX(amount) to get the largest payment and set the date condition correctly without seeing an example on how to subtract a number of days from the current date. It's doing pretty well, but let's try something a little trickier now, using the same instruction and examples:</span></span></p><div id="block-1af088fb733248dc82c23d45d4f90707"><p><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/blog.seekwell.io/bc58b0bf-c5ab-46c6-903c-989e2d5bd0c0.gif" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto" objectfit="contain" objectposition="center" loading="lazy"></p></div><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> when did user with email </span><span><a href="mailto:brian@seekwell.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brian@seekwell.io</a></span><span> make his last payment?</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>GPT-3 Response:</strong></span><span> SELECT MAX(charge_dt) FROM charges WHERE user_id = 1 AND email = 'brian@seekwell.io'</span></span></p><p><span><span>Okay, not </span><span><em>quite </em></span><span>right. The "charges" table doesn't have a column for email, so this query would fail. I also never said the user with email = "brian@seekwell.io" has user_id = 1â€”don't know where it got that idea from. To answer the question correctly, you would have to join the "charges" table with the "users" table since only "users" has an email column. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Since it's a big leap to know to join those tables on </span><span><a href="http://users.id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">users.id</a></span><span> = charges.user_id (even if that seems perfectly logical to a human analyst), I'll give GPT-3 an example of a "join" so it has something to go off of:</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> when did jane</span><span><a href="mailto:mike@seekwell.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@seekwell.io</a></span><span> make her first payment?
</span><span><strong>Output:</strong></span><span> SELECT MIN(charge_dt) as last_payment_dt from charges LEFT JOIN
users ON </span><span><a href="http://users.id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">users.id</a></span><span> = charges.user_id
WHERE users.email = 'jane</span><span><a href="mailto:mike@seekwell.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@seekwell.io</a></span><span>'</span></span></p><p><span><span>Now I'll try again:</span></span></p><div id="block-f72440390edc4af5a45a8c530582b236"><p><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/blog.seekwell.io/a9502b6e-cadf-4c9f-bc2c-f52c6dfb1a15.gif" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto" objectfit="contain" objectposition="center" loading="lazy"></p></div><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> when did user with email </span><span><a href="mailto:brian@seekwell.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brian@seekwell.io</a></span><span> make his last payment?</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>GPT-3 Response:</strong></span><span> SELECT MAX(charge_dt) as last_payment_dt from charges LEFT JOIN users ON </span><span><a href="http://users.id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">users.id</a></span><span> = charges.user_id WHERE users.email = '</span><span><a href="mailto:brian@seekwell.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brian@seekwell.io</a></span><span>'</span></span></p><p><span><span>So maybe this made it a little </span><span><em>too </em></span><span>easy based on the example, but it correctly changed MIN() â†’ MAX() and replaced the email with the one I asked forâ€”so it wasn't a total gimme. Let's try another level of difficulty, but first, I'll add in a few more examples to provide more context and improve the responses. New examples:</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Input: </strong></span><span>how many users signed up in the past 30 days?
</span><span><strong>Output:</strong></span><span> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE signup_dt &gt;= now() - interval '30 days'</span></span></p><p><span><span>I</span><span><strong>nput:</strong></span><span> when did user with email </span><span><a href="mailto:brian@seekwell.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brian@seekwell.io</a></span><span> sign up?
</span><span><strong>Output:</strong></span><span> SELECT signup_dt FROM users WHERE email = 'brian@seekwell.io'</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> how much revenue did we have in the past 7 days?
</span><span><strong>Output:</strong></span><span> SELECT SUM(amount) from charges WHERE charge_dt &gt;= now() - interval '7 days'</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> how much revenue did we have from 10-01-20 through 11-15-20?
</span><span><strong>Output:</strong></span><span> SELECT SUM(case when charge_dt&gt;= '10-01-20'::date and charge_dt &lt; '11-15-20'::date then amount else 0 end) as revenue
FROM charges</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> how much revenue have we had from users that signed up in the last 6 months?
</span><span><strong>Output:</strong></span><span> SELECT SUM(charges.amount) FROM users INNER JOIN
charges ON </span><span><a href="http://users.id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">users.id</a></span><span> = charges.user_id
WHERE users.signup_dt&gt;= now() - interval '6 months'</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> when did user with email </span><span><a href="mailto:brian@seekwell.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brian@seekwell.io</a></span><span> make his first payment?
</span><span><strong>Output:</strong></span><span> SELECT MIN(charge_dt) as last_payment_dt from users INNER JOIN
charges ON </span><span><a href="http://users.id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">users.id</a></span><span> = charges.user_id
WHERE users.email = 'brian@seekwell.io'</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> how many new users signed up in each of the last 2 months?
</span><span><strong>Output:</strong></span><span> SELECT sum(case when signup_dt&gt;= now() - interval '1 month' then 1 else 0 end) as signups_this_month,
sum(case when signup_dt&gt;= now() - interval '2 months' and signup_dt &lt; now() - interval '1 month'  then 1 else 0 end) as signups_last_month
FROM users</span></span></p><p><span><span>These examples give it some basic queries so it's more familiar with my database and the specific terms and concepts of my use case (like that a "paid user" means their plan_type="pro"). I also gave it a taste of some more advanced concepts like aggregating a metric (revenue) between 2 dates. Now I'll try something harder:</span></span></p><div id="block-6441ce9d88ce4930a612ba57661ab84d"><p><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/blog.seekwell.io/7a7fdfbb-5a5e-40e3-8190-551be566af21.gif" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto" objectfit="contain" objectposition="center" loading="lazy"></p></div><div id="block-18b369cf81324662a709ad4fbb328dda"><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> how many payments has user with email </span><span><a href="mailto:joe@freshpizza.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">joe@freshpizza.com</a></span><span> made?</span></span></p></div><p><span><span><strong>GPT-3 Response:</strong></span><span> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users INNER JOIN  charges ON </span><span><a href="http://users.id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">users.id</a></span><span> = charges.user_id WHERE users.email = 'joe@freshpizza.com'</span></span></p><p><span><span>Cool! GPT-3 intuited that COUNT() was the appropriate expression here, knew to join the "users" with the "charges" table, and correctly set the email to the one that I asked about. Another question for GPT-3:</span></span></p><div id="block-ffa8bb2d8599471281fb42c295d51031"><p><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/blog.seekwell.io/dc73f28b-a0c0-4ccd-9713-af5f77c72710.gif" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto" objectfit="contain" objectposition="center" loading="lazy"></p></div><p><span><span>I</span><span><strong>nput:</strong></span><span> how much revenue have we received from users with an email ending in '</span><span><a href="http://seekwell.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seekwell.io</a></span><span>' in the last 3 months?</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>GPT-3 Response:</strong></span><span> SELECT SUM(charges.amount) FROM users INNER JOIN charges ON </span><span><a href="http://users.id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">users.id</a></span><span> = charges.user_id WHERE users.email LIKE '%</span><span><a href="http://seekwell.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seekwell.io</a></span><span>%' AND users.signup_dt&gt;= now() - interval '3 months'</span></span></p><p><span><span>Perfect! It knew that "email ending in seekwell.io" translated in SQL to "</span><span><a href="http://users.email/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">users.email</a></span><span> LIKE '%seekwell.io%' " (even though it hadn't seen that before) and took the sum of all charges for users matching that condition.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>It’s 2021, and data fetching on the web still sucks. This is crazy!</p>
<p>If you’re building a web app at scale you have plenty of options for data management:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fetch</code>, <code>XMLHTTPRequest</code>, etc. (REST)</li>
<li><a href="https://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> (REST)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/falcor">Falcor</a> (REST)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client">Apollo</a> (GraphQL)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/facebook/relay">Relay</a> (GraphQL)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/protobufjs/protobuf.js">Protobuf</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/grpc/grpc-node">gRPC</a></li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>But none of these do everything well. What do you need to do well to be a good data fetching library?</p>
<h2>Fetching Data</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consistency when fetching data</strong>. When your app fetches new data, the UI should automatically update everywhere that data is used.</li>
<li><strong>Request batching</strong>. When multiple requests are made at the same time, they should be combined into one request, when reasonable, to avoid hitting browser-imposed concurrency limits.</li>
<li><strong>Avoiding network waterfalls</strong>. When fetching data for a component, you should make one request that includes data for all its descendents too, to avoid lots of network round trips. GraphQL solves this with fragments, but it’s still painful in modern clients (eg. Relay does this by requiring you  manually compose fragments up the React tree so they’re fetched together, then pass fragment pointers down the tree to tell Relay where to look for fetched data; it also requires a compilation step).</li>
<li><strong>UX when fetching data</strong>. It’s a big burden for engineers to have to manually add loading spinners and error states, and engineers often forget.</li>
<li><strong>Colocation</strong>. You should declare data dependencies close to where they’re used, ideally in the same file. Same principle as colocating CSS with your components.</li>
<li><strong>File size</strong>. You shouldn’t have to ship kilobytes of metadata describing your data schema to clients in order to fetch data.</li>
<li><strong>Type safety</strong>. Your code should know what type of data it got from the server.</li>
<li><strong>Versioning</strong>. Updating your data model should be backwards-compatible; clients should be forwards-compatible.</li>
<li><strong>Realtime updates</strong>. Sometimes, you want data to be pushed, not pulled (eg. for things like notifications). But the APIs for pushing and pulling data are often different, both on the client and on the server.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Updating Data</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consistency when updating data</strong>. When you update a piece of data, your data fetching library should automatically refetch dependent data that will change after the request completes (eg. if you update <code>Person.FirstName</code>, <code>Person.FullName</code> should automatically be refetched).</li>
<li><strong>Optimistic updates</strong>. The UI should optimistically render the success state before a server response comes back, if there’s a high chance the request will succeed. This makes your UI feel snappy and fun to use. Today’s data fetching libraries make this a lot of manual work.</li>
<li><strong>Request queueing</strong>. Requests that depend on one another need to be queued; independent requests can be sent in parallel. Otherwise, network weather and server queuing can cause your client to end up in a state that’s inconsistent with the server.</li>
<li><strong>UX when updating data</strong>. Product engineers shouldn’t need to manually render loading spinners and success and error notifications.</li>
<li><strong>Durability when updating data</strong>. Exponential backoff for retrying idempotent requests and idempotence tokens for network failures; eager persistance to disk for client/server failures.</li>
<li><strong>Type safety</strong>. You shouldn’t be able to send invalid input to the server, for some definition of invalid.</li>
<li><strong>Versioning</strong>. Updates to your mutation APIs should be backwards-compatible; clients should be forwards-compatible.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>I think the reason this hasn’t been solved is it’s a hard problem that’s at the intersection of a bunch of fast-moving technologies:</p>
<ol>
<li>Programming languages (to infer what data depends on what)</li>
<li>Databases (client-side stores are small databases)</li>
<li>Server APIs and protocols (REST, GraphQL, RPC, etc.)</li>
<li><s>UI frameworks</s> (at this point, React has won)</li>
<li>User experience and perceived performance</li>
</ol>
<p>So far, every attempt at solving data fetching has either tightly coupled all of these layers, leading to trouble gaining mass adoption (think <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a>); other solutions have tackled just one layer, ignoring the rest. This smells to me like the abstractions &amp; APIs for each layer are wrong: you shouldn’t need tight coupling to solve data fetching. Instead, you need better abstractions.</p>
<p>Is this a problem that can be solved?</p>

            <p>Over the past year I’ve used web technologies to create audio games like soundStrider and participate in numerous game jams.
With syngen I’m releasing my tools as open-source so folks can join me in crafting dynamic audio experiences and games for the web.
Continue reading to dive into its features, view example code, and learn more about its future.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>syngen is a game engine and synthesis toolkit that specializes in creating audio games with fully synthesized sounds.
If you’ve played any of my games before, then you might be familiar with its capabilities.</p>

<p>It provides a light wrapper around the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Web Audio API</a> with tools for building synths and positioning them as props on a three-dimensional binaural soundstage.
Its event loop fires each frame to update props and core systems.
Additional utilities provide tools for engineering custom systems that hook into its API to deliver rich experiences.</p>

<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Wrapper for the Web Audio API with a domain-specific API</li>
  <li>Event-driven main loop and core systems</li>
  <li>Interfaces and utilities for building custom sounds and systems</li>
  <li>Binaural processing to position sounds on a realistic stage</li>
  <li>Virtualized mixer for advanced signal routing and mastering</li>
  <li>Built-in synthesizers, effects, and global reverb send</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>Please <a href="https://github.com/nicross/syngen" rel="noopener" target="_blank">clone the repository</a> or install with your favorite package manager:</p>



<p>The library <em>must</em> be used within a browser environment so it can access the <code>window</code> object.
You may <code>require('syngen')</code> as a UMD module, or include <code>dist/syngen.min.js</code> to assign it to the <code>syngen</code> global.</p>

<h3 id="example-usage">Example usage</h3>
<p>This example demonstrates how to define a prop and instantiate one on the soundstage.
Here you’ll hear a relatively loud sine tone playing Middle C, centered in the stereo field:</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="the-future-of-syngen">The future of syngen</h2>
<p>This initial release reflects a year of learning with game development.
It contains some assumptions and vestiges that have remained since I first started this journey.
For this reason it’s been released as version 0.1.0 to indicate that it’s experimental and to be used at your own risk in production.
Hopefully the examples above demonstrate the rewards of that gamble.</p>

<p>Because I have games in production on this release branch, it needs to remain backwards compatible.
Therefore, minor version bumps and patch releases will only contain new features and bug fixes.
If it ever reaches the 1.0.0 milestone, then that will indicate a stabilization of this current API.</p>

<p>What I would like to do in a 2.0.0 release branch is reflect on my previous assumptions to rework it entirely.
This might include simplifications and optimizations that improve its power and usability.
Ideally it would empower me to build a new generation of audio games beyond what I’ve thought possible and learned this past year.</p>

<p>Please reach out or <a href="https://github.com/nicross/syngen/issues" rel="noopener" target="_blank">create an issue on GitHub</a> if you encounter any bugs or have any questions or projects to share.
I’m excited to hear your creations!</p>

            <section>
                <div><p>I've been using React since 2016. React has changed a lot since then, but the fundamentals have stayed the same.</p>
<p>In the last couple of years, the <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/">Product Hunt</a> team and I have settled on a way to structure our components.</p>
<p>The goal is to make understanding components easier.</p>
<p>Every component should provide quick answers to the following questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the props this component needs?</li>
<li>What does this component do?</li>
<li>What are the component's states?</li>
<li>What is the component's logic?</li>
<li>How can we trace the logic?</li>
<li>Is it easy to refactor?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="componentasdirectory">Component as directory</h2>
<p>Components are encapsulated in directories that contain their individual parts.</p>
<p>The only public thing there is the main <code>index</code> file.<br>
Everything else is considered private.</p>
<p>Here is what the component directory looks like:</p>
<pre><code>~/components/[Component]/index.tsx                // default export is the used component
~/components/[Component]/Fragment.graphql         // GraphQL fragment for the component
~/components/[Component]/Mutation.graphql         // GraphQL mutation for the component
~/components/[Component]/styles.module.css        // css-module, with styles for the component
~/components/[Component]/[icon].svg               // icon asset
~/components/[Component]/utils.ts                 // helper functions/classes for the component
~/components/[Component]/utils.test.ts            // tests for helper functions/classes
~/components/[Component]/[SubComponent]/index.tsx // when this component is complex, it's might
~/components/[Component]/[SubComponent]/...       // be split it into multiple components
~/components/[Component]/[SubComponent]/...       // they are private and shouldn't be imported
~/components/[Component]/[SubComponent]/...       //  from outside its parent component
</code></pre>
<h2 id="component">Component</h2>
<p>Every component we have, has an entry point like the following:</p>
<pre><code>// components/Component/index.js

// 1) Component props
// always name this "IProps"
// this makes it easy to quickly see the expected props for this component
interface IProps {
  // ...
};

// 2) Main component export
// immediately after, put the component name since this is what this package is all about
// use default function values for default props
export default function ComponentName({ prop1, prop2 = 'default value' }: IProps) {
  // component is structured by
  // 2.1) Hooks
  // if this is more than 5 lines, a custom hook is extracted
  // more about this - https://blog.rstankov.com/extract-react-hook-refactoring/

  // 2.2) Guard clauses
  if (someCondition) {
    return null;
  } 

  if (someOtherCondiation) {
    return &lt;SamePlaholder /&gt;
  }

  // 2.3) The happy path of the component
	return &lt;div&gt;My component&lt;/div&gt;;
}

// 3) Everything else...
// Here's where the smaller helper hooks, utils, and components live.
// If those get bigger, they can be moved into separate files in the component directory
</code></pre>
<p>This structure makes it very easy to scan component and find what you are looking for.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This structure has served us well, and its fundamentals have stayed the same when migrating from classes to hooks, from flow type to TypeScript, and so.</p>

<p>All the things that can happen to databases, corruption is not the one that happens frequently, but when it does it can result in major downtime and data loss. Probably it is one of the most terrifying things for a DBA to come across and the best way to deal with it is to not even deal with it in the first place.</p>







<p>Database corruption can be defined as a problem associated with unintended modification of original data or improper storage of actual data. It is referred to error in database that happens during reading, writing, storing or processing of unintended changes to original data.   </p>



<p>The symptoms of the corrupted database can range from getting a WARNING message in a log file to database server crashing and refusing to startup.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I will try to list some administrative measures and best practices that we can follow to avoid the PostgreSQL database from getting corrupt in the first place and the subsequent post will talk about the options we have to recover from a corrupted database.</p>







<p>PostgreSQL databases, or for that matter any database can get corrupted for a variety of reasons, Some of those are avoidable while others can be mitigated. There are three main causes of database corruption that ranges from bad hardware/software, misconfigurations, and user errors.</p>



<h2>Bad Hardware</h2>



<p>Bad hardware is one of the top causes of database corruption. Most commonly it’s the bad-disk and rarely the culprit turns out to be a bad memory. When it’s a problematic hard disk and the data that we previously wrote is no more there or becomes different. More often it results in a database crash and sometimes gives other symptoms as well.</p>



<p>While bad-memory is very unusual but not impossible. When that happens the data gets corrupted even before it gets written to the disk and eventually corrupted data gets stored on the disk and it usually gives similar symptoms as corrupted disks.</p>



<h2>Bad Software</h2>



<p>The second big cause of database corruption is bad software. All software has bugs and there are lots of software that needs to work perfectly to produce and store the correct data.  It is possible that data corruption can trace back to a software bug. It could be a bug in the PostgreSQL server itself, or the operating system, or a filesystem. For example, <code>zfs</code> on Linux is known to have data corruption bugs.</p>



<h2>Misconfigurations and User errors</h2>



<p>Out of all the known causes of data corruption, the most common one is the user errors and misconfigurations. There are several things that we can do wrong which can result in database corruption and this category of database corruption can be easily avoided by following best practices.</p>



<h2>Symptoms of a corrupted database</h2>



<p>Corruption by its nature is one of a thing, there exists no specific error that gets thrown by PostgreSQL when the database becomes corrupted. So you need to carefully lookout for the signs to detect it. Sometimes the data corruption problems are easily identifiable while other times they can go on undetected till they drive us crazy.</p>



<p>Some of the problems that can give the hint of database corruption are.</p>



<h3>Unexpected Query Results</h3>



<ul><li>The user inserted a data in table and subsequent select on table returned altogether a different/invalid result. </li><li>User who executes a particular query, part of his regular workflow suddenly notices an unexpected reduction in the number of rows. </li><li>Query that was working fine now went into infinite loop. </li></ul>



<p>These kinds of problems hint at database corruption. Obviously, there could be other reasons but if the investigation on these unexpected results turns out to be a problem with the contents of the actual data stored in the file rather than some bug or user action, only then it is database corruption.</p>



<h3>Start getting deleted or duplicate rows.</h3>



<p>If you notice that SQL queries started returning deleted or duplicated rows, rows from the rollbacked transactions, then this could be a database corruption and needs immediate attention,</p>



<h3>System crashes attempting to read data</h3>



<p>Process crashes while trying to read data could be caused by a variety of reasons including the corrupted database.</p>



<h3>Hints of corruption in log messages</h3>



<p>Be vigilant about Error messages that complain about internal things rather than user-visible things. <br>For example: below are some error messages that give the hint of database corruption&nbsp;</p>



<pre><span>ERROR:&nbsp; could <strong>not</strong> <strong>read</strong> block 274179 in file "base/13642/24643.2": <strong>read</strong> only 0 of 8192 bytes

ERROR:&nbsp; could not access status of transaction 3250922107
DETAIL:&nbsp; Could not open file "pg_xact/0C1C": No such file or directory.

ERROR: failed to re-find parent key in index "pg_attribute_relid_attnum_index" for split pages 6424/6425&nbsp;

PANIC could not locate a valid checkpoint record

ERROR:&nbsp; found multixact 68834765 from before relminmxid 73262006

Error:&nbsp; failed to re-find parent key in the index "xxx" for split pages yyy/zzz

ERROR:&nbsp; cache lookup failed for type 16292881

PANIC could not locate a valid checkpoint record</span></pre>







<p>So let’s now discuss how we can avoid or at least quickly detect database corruption.</p>



<h2>Backup and Restore</h2>



<h3>Take regular backups.</h3>



<p>The first and foremost practice you need to follow is to take regular backups. Taking a backup serves two purposes. First, it gives us a copy of data that we can use for disaster recovery, secondly successful backup means that all of your data is readable. Which is the first checkpoint in maintaining that the database is not corrupted.</p>



<h3>Test by restoring the backup.</h3>



<p>The backup that is not restorable is not a backup. So it is important to test each backup by restoring it and starting the server on the restored backup and verifying the contents. It may not be possible to verify every single byte of the restored database but you can write or use some script that can do the sanity checking of the restored database.</p>



<h2>Configurations</h2>



<p>There are three database settings that are important for preventing the database corruption.</p>



<h3>Use fsync=on</h3>



<p><code>fsync</code> ensures that all data is flushed to the disk so that all changed information can be retrieved even if the system crashes or is rebooted. Although you may feel a slight performance impact of keeping the <code>fsync=on</code> but turning it off would mean it is highly likely that you will get a corrupted database in case of an operating system crash.</p>



<h3>Use full_page_writes = on</h3>



<p>In theory, if the operating system’s filesystem cache uses the 8k or larger chunk size then we don’t require a full_page_write to be turned on. But practically we can end up in situations where we get a partial page written to disk in an event of a system crash or power failure. So it is highly recommended to keep the <code>full_page_writes</code> to guard against data corruption.</p>



<h3>Figure out the right value for <code>wal_sync_method</code></h3>



<p>Wal_sync_method has multiple options to choose from. The default is not necessarily ideal; it might be necessary to change this setting or other aspects of your system configuration in order to create a crash-safe configuration or achieve optimal performance. Refer to the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-reliability.html">https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-reliability.html</a> for selecting the correct value for the parameter for your operating system and also check <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgtestfsync.html">pg_test_fsync</a>  output to try out the configured value (hint: The correct method would not be the fastest one)</p>



<h3>Use checksum enabled</h3>



<p>You want to detect corruption as early as possible to ensure that you have the best chance of fixing it and stop it from spreading. So it is highly recommended to use checksums since in case of data corruption the checksum fails and you will get an error straight away.</p>



<p>To enable checksums you need to do <code>initdb</code> with -k switch and from PG 12 onwards you can use the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/app-pgchecksums.html">pg_checksums</a> -e to enable the checksums on the existing data directory. </p>



<h2>Storage</h2>



<p>The next area of best practices is to choose a good storage system and filesystem. For example, relying on a single disk and hoping it will never get failed is not a wise option. So using <code>RAID</code> is a good practice. Similarly, exercise caution when selecting the filesystem, there are filesystems that have known data corruption problems, avoid using those. <code>Ext4</code> and <code>xfs</code> on Linux are known to be more reliable than other filesystems. So double-check all your storage and filesystem selections.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Administration</h2>



<p>Finally lets go through some of the DOs and DON’Ts to avoid the data corruption&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Plug-pull test your system</h3>



<p>Before going live Plug-pull test your system. Put it under load with something like, <code>pgbench</code>, then literally pull the power plug out, so your server loses power and shuts down uncleanly. If your database doesn’t come back up fine you have hardware, OS, or configuration problems. Do this repeatedly while under load, until you’re confident it’ll come up reliably.</p>



<h3>Never Modify the data files manually</h3>



<p>Everything in the PostgreSQL data directory is absolutely vital and should never be messed with directly. So except for conf files, it’s not wise to directly modify any file part of the data directory.</p>



<h3>Do not delete postmaster.pid</h3>



<p>Deleting the <code>postmaster.pid</code> file can allow multiple servers to run on the same data directory. And this is the quickest recipe for getting a corrupt database.</p>



<h3>Do not run Antivirus on the Data directory</h3>



<p>Antivirus can modify or delete files and that is absolutely not recommended to delete/modify any PostgreSQL data files. So it’s best to avoid running antivirus software on the system that is hosting the PostgreSQL database.</p>



<h3>Avoid Kill-9 any PostgreSQL process</h3>



<p><code>kill -9</code> is not smart and should be the last resort; first, use <code>pg_cancel_backend</code> then <code>pg_terminate_backend</code> before thinking about kill -9</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>The post lists some DOs and DON’Ts for avoiding data corruption and talks about the causes and symptoms of the database corruption. In the second part, I will discuss the possible ways to recover from the corruption …</p></div></div>

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>In this web essay I present research on dynamically injecting realtime annotations and visualizations into a programming environment for live coding performance. The techniques I describe enable both performers and audiences to gain greater insight into discrete events, continuous signals, and the algorithmic transformation of musical pattern. I catalog these techniques and encourage readers to interactively experiment with each of them, and conclude by describing challenges and future directions for this line of research.</p>
      </section>

			<section id="Introduction">
        <p><em>NOTE: The examples in this essay currently only work in Chrome, and even then not in iOS. I'm working on it!</em></p>

				<h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>This web essay will explore the addition of annotations and visualizations to custom-developed programming environments for <a href="http://toplap.org/about">live coding performance</a>; in this essay I will use the term 'live coding' to refer to the digital arts practice, as opposed to live programming more generally.  I provide a catalogue of techniques I've developed to help reveal algorithmic activity to both audience members and programmer/performers. These techniques are implemented in standard JavaScript, which is also the end-user language; however, many are generalizable and some have drawn inspiration from features found in programming environments for other languages. The code examples below are <em>live</em>; feel free to make minor edits and view / listen to the resulting changes. In addition to pressing the 'Play' button, which selects all code in a given example and runs it, you can also highlight code you'd like to execute and hit Ctrl+Enter.</p>

        <p>Before diving in, I'd like to provide an example of what many of these annotations look like when combined, as shown in Listing 1. Although they might be somewhat overwhelming when simultaneously viewed, in my experience they can provide valuable scaffolding to the development of a program as it is written over time.</p>

			<section id="Motivation">
				<h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>The initial motivation for this research was to improve audience understanding of live coding performances, where source code is written on stage and often projected for the audience to follow. However, over time the feedback provided by the annotations and visualizations described also became important to my personal performance practice [<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14794713.2016.1227602?journalCode=rpdm20">7</a>]. The feedback provides important indications of activity, and a quick way to visually confirm that algorithms are proceeding as intended. A survey I conducted with over a hundred live coders and computer scientists indicated a high level of interest in the types of annotations presented here [<a href="http://www.charlie-roberts.com/pubs/gibber.annotations.pdf" target="_blank">1</a>].</p>

        <p>Although parts of this research have been previously presented to the digital arts community, my goal in describing it to the LIVE community is to obtain feedback from a broader community of computer scientists with interests in the psychology of programming and in novel techniques for interactive programming environments. There are also a number of new techniques presented in this essay for the first time. Finally, I believe that the web essay format is fundamentally the best vehicle for presenting this research, as the animated/temporal characteristics of the annotations and visualizations are difficult to convey in static text and images, such as in the papers I have previously published on the subject.</p>

        <p>Outside of informal, high-level descriptions, I do not explain the code or APIs used in the examples. The focus is instead on how algorithms are annotated / visualized, and I provide only the minimal explanation necessary to understand our design decisions in this regard. While my research to date has focused on implementation and evaluation in the context of our personal artistic practice, I look forward to more formal user evaluations in the future, and are particuarly interested in implications for teaching computational media.</p> 
			</section>


      <section id="Principles">
      <h3>Guiding principles</h3>
      <p>There are three principles that guide the design of the presented annotations and visualizations.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>If a value changes over time (typically related to musical progression or signal processing), display its current state, either by adding a visualization / annotation  or by modifying the source code to reflect the current value.</li>
        <li>Make annotations and visualizations as proximal as possible to the code fragment responsible for generating the data they are representing.</li>
        <li>In addition to displaying when values change, whenever possible also provide some indication of when a value is being <em>read</em>, in particular when there is a direct affect on musical / sonic output.
      </li></ol>

      <p>The first principle is fundamentally constrained by screen real estate; therefore, only the current state of variables found in code within the editing environment's current viewport is actively displayed. However, this is still very different from environments where time-varying variables must be explicitly 'watched' by the programmer. By displaying all updates concurrently, audience members can choose the algorithms they'd like to watch develop, and the time programmer/performers must spend on user interactions for viewing state is minimized.</p>

      <p>In regards to the second principle, the types of data that can be easily represented inside of an editing environment constrain annotations and visualizations. It is easy to display short sequences of musical data outputted by a generative algorithm inside of the editor; it is more difficult to display sequences that are thousands of values in length. While I can readily imagine use cases where longer sequences are musically useful, in the environments I work on shorter sequences are more common during typical use.</p>

      <p>With these three principles in mind, the next section describes a variety of annotations and visualization that I, and other users, have found useful in the context of live coding performances.</p>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Catalog of techniques</h3>
        <p>This research augments programming interfaces to include visualizations, self-modifying source code, automated annotations via inserted code comments, and a variety of other techniques. By injecting annotations and visualizations into the source code itself, we improve association between code and the annotations / visualizations depicting its effects. This placement of visualizations is characterized as <em>in situ</em> by Hofswell et. al, [<a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jhoffs/website/resources/papers/2018-AugmentingCode-CHI.pdf" target="_blank">2</a>], who demonstrated the effectiveness of such visualizations in improving both speed and accuracy when completing tasks related to data visualization and code comprehension.</p> 

        <h4>Repeating static values</h4>
        <p>The simplest annotation added to our environment is a rotating border around static elements that are accessed repeatedly. The rotation provides a visual indication of when the values are used. Survey results indicated that rotation was preferable to other techniques (such as flashing) due to its less distracting nature [<a href="http://www.charlie-roberts.com/pubs/gibber.annotations.pdf" target="_blank">1</a>].</p>
        
        <p>Listing 2 shows a repeated scale index (0) being triggered every quarter note. We'll see how this simple annotation can be useful in combination with others in the next section.</p>

        <div id="static1" caption="Listing 2: Rotating borders indicating actvity.">
          <p>
syn = Synth('bleep')
syn.note.seq( 0, 1/4 )
          </p> 
        </div>

        <p>It is worth noting that 'distracting' flashes can also be used to great effect; in the live-coding environment SchemeBricks by Dave Griffith blocks flash whenever they receive a control signal, providing an indication of activity with greater spectacle.</p>

      <section>
        <h4>Cycling through musical patterns</h4>
        <p>Musical patterns (aka sets) are common ways of expressing lists that can be transformed and manipulated algorithmically.
        However, even if a pattern is read from start to finish without modification, it can still be useful to know which elements of
        the pattern are being triggered when, so that programmers and audience members can associate the the values being triggered with
        the corresponding sonic results.</p>

        <p>In Listing 3, a synthesizer plays a simple pattern that loops through the seven notes of a standard scale from Western harmony. In addition to this melodic pattern, a rhythmic pattern alternates between quarter notes and eighth notes in duration.</p>

        <div id="array1" caption="Listing 3: Revealing the phase of musical patterns.">
          <p>
syn = Synth('bleep')
syn.note.seq( [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7], [1/4,1/8] )
          </p> 
        </div>

        <p>The potential of this method is more apparent when the pattern is not playing sequentially. In Listing 4, scale indices are randomly chosen. Also note that the rotating border annotation now provides a indication of how many times a randomly chosen value has been repeated in a row (modulo 4). </p>

        <div id="array2" caption="Listing 4: Highlighting randomly selected members of patterns.">
          <p>
syn = Synth('bleep')
syn.note.seq( [0,3,7].rnd(), 1/8 )
          </p> 
        </div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="8a920a5" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default"><div><p>Every so often I get asked for advice on how to become an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/heroes/">AWS Hero</a>.</p><p>The specific answer isn’t that interesting – “get involved in the community and hope someone nominates you as a Hero” seems to be the process at AWS. I understand that the <a href="https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/overview">Microsoft MVP process</a> is a bit more transparent and better prescribed.</p><p>But the general question of “how do I become well-respected in my chosen technical specialty” is VERY interesting. Even if you don’t have any aspirations to build a public following, there is tremendous career value in becoming the go-to person within your technical niche.</p><p>The person who everybody on your team comes to with their toughest question about that language or framework. The person who knows where all the bodies are buried in ActiveDirectory or Typescript or DynamoDB. Those folks have great careers and job security because authoritative knowledge like that is rare.</p><p>To some extent, it’s rare because wisdom only comes with experience. But I know plenty of engineers who’ve sat in the same chair for ten years getting the same year of experience ten times. Heck, I’ve been there myself; I spent a couple of years as an “accidental DBA” who never really learned that much about SQL Server beyond what the daily firefighting required.</p><p>I used to spend a lot of time wondering how other people seemed to level up so quickly on new technologies. How do you break through that stagnant cycle of learning and forgetting stuff in bits and pieces, using the same technology for years without ever feeling like an expert?</p><p>A few years ago I learned a secret for doing this, a cheat code if you will, from my fellow AWS Hero <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/author/jared-short">Jared Short</a>. This is his secret recipe for leveling up in tech:</p><p><strong>Read the documentation for one job-relevant technology, cover-to-cover, every week. </strong></p><figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Forrest is giving away my secrets, but it's true. I'd estimate around 700+ hours of just reading AWS docs over my career with intent to retain / learn (not just reference). It feels silly until you almost immediately understand some esoteric side-effect or behavior. <a href="https://t.co/juQ0b9mENI">https://t.co/juQ0b9mENI</a></p>— Jared Short (@ShortJared) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShortJared/status/1347629518312378369?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2021</a></blockquote> </div></figure><h2 id="h-reading-docs-the-wrong-way-and-the-right-way">Reading docs: the wrong way and the right way</h2><p>I get it, that doesn’t sound revolutionary. “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM">RTFM</a>” is literally as old as computing itself. It’s the classic kiss-off answer to questions you ought to be able to Google.</p><p>And that betrays a key limitation in how a lot of us think about documentation. We think of it tactically, as a resource to query when we have a specific question or encounter a particular error. We use docs to fill in our <em>known unknowns.</em></p><p>That’s how you can get stuck for years, say, administering a PostgresSQL cluster and never really becoming that deep of an expert on Postgres. If you only learn something new when the situation demands it, your mental model of Postgres (or whatever) will look like a gradually expanding version of this:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2181" height="1647" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png" alt="" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png 2181w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png 1024w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png 768w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png 1536w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2181px) 100vw, 2181px"></figure><p>Over time, as you encounter more new use cases for the technology, you’ll burn more “never forget” bubbles into the mental model. But you’ll still have this heavy sense of unknown unknowns hanging over you, and you’ll never be sure if you’re really using the optimal approach to solve a new problem.</p><p>Instead, Jared’s approach is to read docs strategically<em>, </em>preemptively, curiously: as a way to fill in your <em>unknown unknowns</em>. The things you might not encounter in ten years, but that would cost you two days of troubleshooting if you ran into them tomorrow.</p><p>Read docs like novels (cover to cover), not like dictionaries (look up the term, cross-reference, and stop). Over time, that strategy will lead to a mental model of your professional domain that looks more like this:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="727" height="549" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/strategic.png" alt="" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/strategic.png 727w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/strategic.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 727px) 100vw, 727px"></figure><p>(This is <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/how-many-certifications-do-i-need-to-get-a-cloud-job">the same benefit</a> you get from studying for certifications, by the way: you’re building a mental map of the domain, so you don’t have to stumble through the darkness on every new quest.)</p><p>On the surface, that sounds simple, but it’s far from easy. Here are three common objections people raise when I advise reading docs as a career-advancement strategy:</p><h4 id="h-i-don-t-have-a-photographic-memory-i-ll-never-remember-a-bunch-of-random-docs"><strong>“I don’t have a photographic memory. I’ll never remember a bunch of random docs.”</strong></h4><p>Back when I was in college, a well-meaning friend convinced me I should read a book on SAP. Forget today — I couldn’t have told you a single thing about SAP <em>ten minutes after finishing that book</em>. I’d never been inside an enterprise, much less understood the problems these ERP integrations I was reading about were supposed to solve. It was like trying to talk to the aliens in the movie <em>Arrival</em>: my brain was the wrong shape.</p><p>Likewise, you probably won’t get much value out of glancing through docs for a technology you don’t use and have no context for.</p><p>So do these two things:</p><p>1. <strong>Focus on docs for technologies you are already using</strong>. We’ve all had that mind-numbing feeling when plowing through some esoteric text that doesn’t relate to our daily lives, where you glaze over for three pages and then go, “what did I just read?”</p><p>Avoid this by focusing on docs for technologies or languages you’ve already got a vested stake in – say, because they’re on your plate at work or you’re trying to build them into a side project.</p><p>Encourage active reading and engagement with the information by asking yourself questions like these as you read:</p><ul id="block-ef7bb5e0-252c-434f-98de-116c8c0e2003"><li>Did I understand that? (If not, maybe read the section again)</li><li>Does what I just read match my existing mental model of how this technology works? (If not, do I need to go review a different doc and then come back to this?)</li><li>Could this feature or fact help me on my current project?</li><li>If I had known this six months ago, what would I have done differently? (“Chosen a different technology” is a totally acceptable answer!)</li></ul><p>Then, <strong>2. Read those docs repeatedly, on a schedule, over and over</strong>. Seriously. If you’re on a team that’s building out centralized CI/CD for Azure, maybe read the part of the Azure DevOps docs on pipelines this week and the part on build agents next week, and when you get to the end, start over. The cloud changes fast. You’ll fold in new information at the same time you’re reinforcing the old.</p><h4 id="h-i-don-t-have-time-to-read-a-bunch-of-documentation"><strong>“I don’t have time to read a bunch of documentation.”</strong></h4><p>Yes, and weeks of work can save you hours of planning. Maybe use some of the time you currently spend injecting “HERE” print statements into your code to figure out why it’s not working.</p><figure><img src="https://faasandfurious.com/pages/debugging-tactics.png" alt="Debugging Tactics"></figure><p>More seriously, it’s not a bad idea to block a bit of time on your calendar each day – 30 minutes, even –  for targeted doc-reading. You may find it hard to carve that time out of your workday, but defending time and setting expectations with your manager is its own skill, worth practicing. Call the block of time “deep work.” It is.</p><h4 id="h-the-docs-for-technology-x-are-no-good-trust-me-they-re-not-worth-reading"><strong>“The docs for [technology X] are no good. Trust me, they’re not worth reading.”</strong></h4><p>I don’t always buy this excuse. The docs might not be that bad; you might just have the wrong expectations.</p><p>For example, the AWS documentation gets <a href="https://twitter.com/IanColdwater/status/1347737875991777280">a terrible rap</a> for being wordy and poorly-organized. And it’s maybe even worse than you’ve heard – if you’re trying to look up the name of an IAM action or the syntax of a CLI command, that is.</p><p>But as an educational tool that dives deep on the architectural underpinnings and technical limitations of services, the AWS docs are <em>fantastic. </em>They’re better than any book you could ever buy about the cloud. (And the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/">Builder’s Library</a> is better still.) The AWS docs are designed not just to be referenced, but to be read. Read ’em!</p><p>On the other hand, some types of docs like step-by-step tutorials are very much designed to be referenced during hands-on builder time. It may not make sense to spend a lot of time reading those in the abstract. So bring your common sense.</p><p>However. There are also plenty of technologies out there where the docs are truly incomplete, out of date, or just plain wrong – many smaller open-source projects, in particular.</p><p>Turns out you have another option here, at least for OSS projects: <em>read the source code.</em> Not sure what a module does, what its edge cases are, what the error code means? Read the source code and find out! It might be faster than (and will definitely be at least as accurate as) looking for the answer in the docs, <em>even if the docs are pretty good. </em></p><p>If you write code for a living, reading other people’s shipped, battle-tested code — not just PRs from your own team — is genuinely one of the most transformative things you can do for your career. Because while you’re answering your immediate question, you’ll also be picking up style, organization, and technique from professional programmers operating under all kinds of interesting constraints. Seriously. Read code.</p><p>(And then, if it’s open-source, maybe consider contributing some docs!)</p><h2 id="h-what-do-i-get-out-of-all-this"><strong>What do I get out of all this?</strong></h2><p>If you read a targeted set of docs consistently over a sustained period — say, a couple of years — while actively practicing on that technology, you will be able to perform magic. That’s a promise.</p><p>Let’s go back to Jared Short again for an example. (Yes, I checked with Jared, he graciously agreed to let me spill his secrets in this piece.) As an engineer at an AWS shop, Jared …</p><ul><li>Reads the documentation for one AWS service, cover to cover, every week.</li><li>Blocks daily time for this on his calendar.</li><li>Focuses on services he’s actually using at work (he tells me that so far in 2021, he’s been through all the docs for Lambda, AppSync, and Step Functions).</li></ul><p>Jared’s been doing this week in, week out, for *years*. And that  unglamorous commitment lets him perform nerd magic like this:</p><figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I needed to understand extensions better for a thing, read the docs cover to cover like an insane person.</p>— Jared Short (@ShortJared) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShortJared/status/1347612782389301249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2021</a></blockquote> </div></figure><p>If you don’t want to take the time to read that whole Twitter thread, let me sum it up for you.</p><ol><li>An experienced AWS engineer encounters a weird behavior: AWS Lambda seems to be executing code when it should not be. He posts a plea for help on Twitter.</li><li>Other experienced engineers take a look and go, “huh. Weird.” To be clear, this is not a case of RTFM. The problem is nontrivial and the solution, if there is one, is not well-known. …</li></ol></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			<!-- Article Start -->
			
<p>On December 22, acting on a tipoff, Indian police swooped on six call centers in Hyderabad, Gurugram, and Bangalore, from which nearly 1,500 telecallers had been working to extract money from indebted and often vulnerable Indians, resulting in 24 arrests. More raids and arrests followed; the next week, a Chinese national and alleged kingpin, Zhu Wei — known as Lambo — was apprehended as he tried to flee the country.</p>



<p>Over the past few months, an <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/economy-finance/india-plunges-into-technical-recession-as-gdp-contracts-75-in-q2fy21">economic contraction</a> and an <a href="https://unemploymentinindia.cmie.com/">increase in unemployment</a> due to the Covid-19 pandemic have led to thousands of Indians turning to online loan apps to meet their day-to-day expenses. These apps often charge interest rates as high as 40% for sums as low as $70. Some are legitimate, regulated businesses, but with government oversight of the sector lax, illegal players — <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/loan-apps-india-cracks-down-on-china-backed-fintech-startups-in-the-country/articleshow/80396442.cms">many of them operated by Chinese companies</a> — have thrived.</p>



<p>Some analysts say that Google, whose Android operating system is by far the most commonly used in the country, bears some responsibility for the rise of these predatory lenders. In the last year alone, <a href="https://dbhub.io/srikanthlogic/loanapps.db">more than 750 loan apps</a> have been added to the Google Play store. Many seem to violate the company’s policy, which doesn’t allow personal lending apps to list if they ask users for repayment less than 60 days after a loan is issued.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“By Google’s own policy, it’s illegal,” said Srikanth Lakshmanan, a member of Cashless Consumer, a consumer protection collective for digital payments. “These instances have clearly shown that the system of enforcing [Google’s] policy is broken.”</p>



<p>The illegal payday lending business is large and sophisticated. KVM Prasad, Hyderabad’s assistant commissioner of police for cyber crime, estimates that rogue apps have handled $3 billion (220 billion rupees) in transactions over the past year. Some of the companies, such as Cash Guru, Udhaar Loan, Go Cash, and Krazy Rupee masquerade as legitimate payday lenders to dupe users. When it comes to calling in their debts, they become predatory, harassing borrowers by sending abusive messages, publicly shaming them on social media, and calling their relatives and friends.</p>



<p>Since September 2020, Anil Rachamalla, an internet ethics and digital wellness expert, has been approached by around 190 people who have been targeted by payday lenders and has been collecting their testimonies to build a legal case. He now runs a support group for 68 victims. Typically, he said, when a user installs an online loan app, they agree to give access to their mobile’s GPS location, gallery, and contact list. Once the user uploads proof of identification, the app credits an instant loan ranging from $60 to $1,000 to a mobile wallet or bank account, deducting up to 30% as a processing fee. The term of the loan is usually between seven and 15 days, after which point, the harassment begins.</p>

<p>Telecallers working for the loan apps start with subtle warnings by SMS, followed by verbal abuse. “If [the borrower] is not lifting his phone, his phone is going to ring the next 100 times,” Rachamalla said. The app’s operators use their access to the borrower’s contacts list to create WhatsApp groups of their friends and families, in which they brand the user as a “fraudster” and threaten them with fake court notices and police complaints.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I have seen people who are [holding their phones] shiver out of fear,” Rachamalla says.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/another-youth-ends-life-over-loan-app-harassment/article33531216.ece">At least 11 people</a> have died by suicide since November 2020 after falling into these debt traps. Sometimes, telecallers force defaulters to borrow from other apps to repay their existing loans. Rachamalla documented one user who started out with a $75 loan from Udhaar Loan — the rip-off version of a legitimate payday lender, Udhaar. To repay it, he ended up more than $1,000 in debt, having borrowed from 15 other apps to cover his arrears.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, most of the victims are “not any carpenter or mason,” Rachamalla said, but “highly qualified people working at the best of the multinational organizations.” He said that the list of victims included people working at Google, Amazon, and Apple who had taken loans after losing their jobs during the downturn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Google’s reticence in dealing with the proliferation of these apps has disappointed groups working to mitigate the impact of predatory lending. Lakshmanan said that his <a href="https://medium.com/cashlessconsumer/fake-digital-lending-apps-collection-harassment-8e56ab5ac0bd">analysis</a> in November showed that many of these apps had no registered entities, fake addresses, and <a href="https://medium.com/cashlessconsumer/fake-digital-lending-apps-collection-harassment-8e56ab5ac0bd">identical boilerplate privacy policies</a>, all of which should have been red flags. However, some of the apps <a href="https://medium.com/cashlessconsumer/fake-digital-lending-apps-collection-harassment-8e56ab5ac0bd">were downloaded over a million</a> times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Udhaar Loan was removed from the Play store in only late December, after Ravi Sethia, the co-founder of Udhaar, filed a copyright infringement complaint with Google. In November, a woman attempted suicide after <a href="https://twitter.com/itisprashanth/status/1325500193836421120">a telecaller for Udhaar Loans demanded nude videos</a> when she was on the verge of defaulting on her loan. “People thought it was us, and they were bombarding us,” Sethia said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Google declined to comment but pointed <em>Rest of World </em>to a January 14 blog post, which said that they were dropping from the Play store apps that were unable to demonstrate compliance with local laws.</p>



<p>Critics say that the company should have acted sooner but also that the failings are widespread — payment services providers and regulators all had opportunities to prevent tragedies from happening. “Everybody should take responsibility,” Rachamalla said.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The latest events have changed many aspects of our personal and business life. Technology has become more essential than ever in connecting people. As an adaptation to the new normal conferences are increasingly being organized online. </p>
<p>The GraphQL Community’s thirst for knowledge knows no bounds so no wonder that more and more conferences are present online. One of them is <strong>GraphQL Asia</strong> 2021 edition organized by Hasura.</p>
<h2>The conference</h2>
<p>The conference takes place <strong>online on 24th &amp; 25th Feb 2021</strong> and anyone is free to join (no fee). This year’s edition is already the third one and considering the quality speakers &amp; talks that took place during the previous ones it is a must-have event in every GraphQL fan’s calendar.</p>
<p>This year’s cast looks super interesting including speakers from industry top companies including <strong>Dan Schafer, GraphQL Co-Creator from Facebook as well as people from IBM, Microsoft, Tesco, Hasura and many more</strong>. All experience in using GraphQL in enterprise-grade products and ready to share their thought on different aspects of it and its ecosystem.</p>
<h2>The talks</h2>
<p>The talks schedule looks quite impressive and anyone should find topics they are interested in. Most of them will be held in English but there are also some in different languages including Japanese, Mandarin or Vietnamese. During the conference, you will learn more on topics like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GraphQL Error Handling</strong> - which still seems to be one of the pains of every GraphQL project will be covered by <a href="https://graphql.asia/talks/graphql-error-handling-done-right/">Kewei Qu</a> from Facebook. Kewei will go over the challenges her team discovered with GraphQL reliability and how they tackled them at Facebook,</li>
<li><strong>Intelligent Caching with GraphQL Gateway</strong> - you will learn from <a href="https://graphql.asia/talks/intelligent-caching-with-graphql-gateway-using-cdc/">Roshan Alexander</a> how they build in Pratilipi an intelligent caching layer over GraphQL gateway to serve data to millions of their users keeping infrastructure cost low,</li>
<li><strong>Schema Stitching in 2021</strong> - <a href="https://graphql.asia/talks/intelligent-caching-with-graphql-gateway-using-cdc/">Greg MacWilliam</a> will bring you closer to the revitalized concept of the Schema Stitching which’s the previous iteration that was famously abandoned by Apollo and now is going through second life,</li>
<li><strong>Client-side migration from REST to GraphQL</strong> - <a href="https://graphql.asia/talks/client-side-migration-strategy-from-rest-to-graphql/">Zhifan Li</a> will cover the most important aspects of migration from REST API to GraphQL in React apps including clues on how to structure your React app’s statement management for GraphQL, simultaneously handling feature development and migration as well as present you examples of key GraphQL client libraries integrations.</li>
</ul>
<p>… and many more! </p>
<h2>Workshops</h2>
<p>Well, that’s not all folks! The conference also offers a series of workshops helping you to master your GraphQL skills including classes on:</p>
<ul>
<li>implementation Server-side Authentication in GraphQL</li>
<li>using GraphQL in the Jamstack</li>
<li>building Type-safe GraphQL apps with TypeScript</li>

        <strong>Deutsche Ermittler haben die Infrastruktur der weltweit als am gefährlichsten geltenden Schadsoftware "Emotet" übernommen und zerschlagen. Die Software hatte auch die IT-Infrastruktur von Behörden und Kliniken angegriffen.</strong>
    </p>


    




    

                
                    

    
    
    
    <p>
        Sie gilt als weltweit gefährlichste Schadsoftware: Deutsche Ermittler haben die Infrastruktur von "Emotet" übernommen und zerschlagen. Dies sei am Dienstag im Rahmen einer internationalen Aktion gelungen, teilten das BKA und die Generalstaatsanwaltschaft Frankfurt am Main mit. 
    </p>


    




    

                
                    

    
    

    




    
        
        
            
            
            
            
            
            
                
    
    

        
    

            
            
            
            
            
        
    

                
                    

    
    

    

    <h2>Angriffe auf Behörden, Kliniken und Privatpersonen</h2>



    




    

                
                    

    
    
    
    <p>
        Das Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI) hatte "Emotet" schon 2018 als gefährlichste Schadsoftware der Welt bezeichnet, weil sie zahlreiche Angriffsmöglichkeiten bot und den Angreifern so etwa Lösegelderpressung zur Herausgabe von Daten ermöglichte.&nbsp;
    </p>


    




    

                
                    

    
    
    
    <p>
        BSI-Präsident Arne Schönbohm verwies auf die lange Liste der Geschädigten durch "Emotet": "Krankenhäuser mussten ihren medizinischen Betrieb einstellen, Gerichte und Stadtverwaltungen wurden lahmgelegt, unzählige Unternehmen hatten keinen Zugriff auf ihre wichtigen Geschäftsdaten und digitalen Prozesse." Dazu seien bei "Zehntausenden" Privatleuten die Rechner attackiert worden, sodass etwa Onlinebanking manipuliert wurde oder Passwörter ausspioniert wurden.
    </p>


    




    

                
                    

    
    

    




    

                
                    

    
    
    
    <p>
        "Emotet" hatte am Kammergericht Berlin zu einem Totalschaden der IT geführt. Das Gericht musste vom Berliner Landesnetz getrennt werden. Auch beim Klinikum Fürth und bei der Stadtverwaltung Frankfurt am Main verursachte "Emotet" erhebliche Schäden, dazu den Ermittlern zufolge auf den Computern Zehntausender Privatpersonen.
    </p>


    




    

                
                    

    
    
    
    <p>
        Nach Einschätzung der Ermittler entstand allein in Deutschland ein Schaden in Höhe von mindestens 14,5 Millionen Euro.
    </p>


    




    

                
                    

    
    

    




    
        
        
            
            
            
            
            
                
            
            
            
            
            
            
        
    

                
                    

    
    

    

    <h2>"Türöffner" für Computersysteme weltweit</h2>



    




    

                
                    

    
    
    
    <p>
        Europol nannte die Software "eines der gefährlichsten Instrumente für Cyber-Attacken der letzten Jahre". 2014 war "Emotet" zunächst als sogenannter Trojaner aufgetaucht. 
    </p>


    




    

                
                    

    
    
    
    <p>
        "Die 'Emotet'-Infrastruktur funktionierte im Kern wie ein erster Türöffner in Computer-Systeme auf weltweiter Ebene", so die Behörde. "Das System konnte auf einzigartige Weise ganze Netzwerke infizieren, nur durch den Zugang zu ein paar wenigen Apparaten." Über ein Word-Dokument, häufig getarnt als harmlos wirkender Anhang einer E-Mail oder auch als Link, wurde in das System eingebrochen, schilderte Europol.
    </p>


    




    

                
                    

    
    
    
    <p>
        Sobald der illegale Zugang gelungen war, wurde dieser an Cyber-Kriminelle verkauft. Diese konnten wiederum eigene Trojaner einschleusen, um etwa an Bankdaten zu gelangen, erbeutete Daten weiterzuverkaufen oder aber Lösegeld für blockierte Daten zu erpressen. 
    </p>


    




    

                
                    

    
    

    




    
        
        
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
        
    

                
                    

    
    

    

    <h2>Internationale Ermittlungen seit 2018</h2>



    




    

                
                    

    
    
    
    <p>
        Die Zerschlagung sei zusammen mit den Strafverfolgungsbehörden der Niederlande, der Ukraine, Litauens, Frankreichs, Großbritanniens, Kanadas und den USA erfolgt, so das BKA. 
    </p>


    




    

                
                    

    
    
    
    <p>
        Die ukrainische Staatsanwaltschaft teilte in Kiew mit, dass dort mehrere Personen festgenommen worden seien. Der Gesamtschaden in den betroffenen Ländern wurde auf 2,5 Milliarden US-Dollar beziffert, umgerechnet etwa 2,1 Milliarden Euro. In Deutschland wurden laut BKA 17 Server beschlagnahmt.
    </p>


    




    

                
                    

    
    
    
    <p>
        Die Ermittlungen wegen des Verdachts des gemeinschaftlichen gewerbsmäßigen Computerbetrugs und anderer Straftaten liefen demnach bereits seit August 2018. Die Zerschlagung bedeute "eine wesentliche Verbesserung" der Cybersicherheit in Deutschland.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
                                                
<p>Have you ever wondered which pages people look at once they have landed on your site? How do they navigate? The same questions go for designing a new digital product. How do people click through your prototype? How do they navigate and interact with the designed solution? </p>



<p>If you are conducting a UX study, you can turn to <strong>Useberry </strong>for answers!</p>



<p>In this post, I want to show you a very cool feature called <strong>User Flow.</strong></p>



<p>With Useberry’s <strong>User Flow</strong> report you can learn about the path a visitor takes before reaching its destination while you are in the prototype phase of the design.</p>



<p>But, first things first.<br></p>



<h3>What is User Flow?</h3>



<p>User Flow visualizes the path a user follows from one screen to the next. It helps you understand the behavior of your users, how they interact with your prototype, and create a conversion funnel for it.</p>



<p>In other words, it is a graphical representation of which screens users utilize to complete a specific task, how they move around your prototype, and, most importantly, which screens they’re on when they decide to leave.</p>



<p>Let’s say a user lands on the “Home” screen, goes to the “About” screen, and then to “Contact Us” before leaving.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>The user path would then be <strong>Home -&gt; About -&gt; Contact Us.</strong></p></div>



<h3>Why is this important?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The User Flow report can indicate specific points where testers remained longer or got stuck perhaps and help you make changes to enhance the user experience. The easier testers can navigate through your prototype and complete your task, the happier visitors to your final product they’ll become.</p>



<p>Gaining a deeper understanding of how testers are interacting with your prototype can help you optimize your screens for maximum conversions.</p>



<p>This means that you’ll be able to see if there are any specific screens that made users leave your test/prototype. Once these screens have been recognized and then altered with more appropriate or engaging content, you can go back to the User Flow report to check if the number of drop-offs has declined.</p>



<blockquote><p><em>You know what you want and like, but to be effective in the UX industry you need to understand the desires of your prospective users.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Understanding the preferences of your target audience is the first step in optimizing your design for conversions. Your aim is to make it easy for your target audience to find and purchase your products and services.<br></p>



<p>Here are just a few of the user behaviors you can learn about with the User Flow report:</p>



<ul><li>Which paths do your testers favor?&nbsp;</li><li>Which screens have the highest drop-off rate?</li></ul>







<h2>What do they look like?</h2>



<p>If you are familiar with the Google Analytics User Flows then you have an idea of how complex (or simple) a User Flow might look.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1024x309.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1024x309.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-300x91.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-768x232.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>A simple user-flow on useberry that shows the path for 10 different users</figcaption></figure>

<h2>How to use User Flow Report in Useberry</h2>



<p>Now that you know what User Flow is and why it’s important, let’s see how you can find and use the report in Useberry and in your designs.</p>



<p>The best way to explain something is with an <strong>example</strong>.</p>



<p>So, let’s create a simple prototype of a music app and monitor how our potential users interact with/navigate through it in order to complete a simple task.</p>



<p>In the following example, we have a “simple” scenario.</p>



<p>We asked 10 testers to “<strong>Add a track to their wish list</strong>”.</p>



<p>The path that the users “should” take and where they “should” click in order to complete the task appears in the screenshot.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/expected-path.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/expected-path-1024x267.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/expected-path-1024x267.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/expected-path-300x78.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/expected-path-768x200.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Expected path users must follow to complete the task</figcaption></figure>



<p>The whole prototype that we are using appears in the following screenshot:</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/all-flow.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/all-flow-1024x573.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/all-flow-1024x573.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/all-flow-300x168.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/all-flow-768x430.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>For the purposes of this example, we created the prototype with <strong>Figma</strong> for which we used the <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Useberry plugin (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/788799088384104964/Useberry" target="_blank">Useberry plugin</a></strong>.<br></p>



<p><strong>Let’s start our test:</strong></p>



<p><strong>Task</strong>: Add a track to your favorites list&nbsp;<br><strong>Instructions</strong>: Navigate through the prototype and add a track to your wish list.<br><strong>Type of test:</strong> Single task<br><strong>Number of blocks used in Useberry</strong>: 2 (Single Task, Thank you)<br><strong>Audience</strong>: People from a Facebook group of music fans<br><strong>Number of testers</strong>: 10<br><strong>Time to get back results:</strong> 4 minutes<br><strong>Link to the test</strong>: <a href="https://app.useberry.com/preview/XT84tChQ/">https://app.useberry.com/preview/XT84tChQ/</a><br></p>



<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/test-results.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/test-results.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/test-results.png 865w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/test-results-300x162.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/test-results-768x415.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 865px) 100vw, 865px"></a></figure></div>



<p>OK, we have 60% success in the single task which means that 4 of our users couldn’t complete the task successfully.</p>



<p><strong>But WHY is this the case? </strong></p>



<p><strong>It was so obvious what they had to do, you might think.<br></strong></p>



<p>Let’s focus on the single task now and look at the results:<br></p>

<p>Ok, we can see that 4 users skipped the task.<br></p>



<p>Now, we have 2 options:</p>



<ul><li>Filter the results and watch the session recording of the specific users</li><li>View the user flow and find the pain area </li></ul>



<p>With 10 testers it’s easy to monitor the session recording of 4 users but <strong>on a larger scale</strong> – what would happen if we had more than 100 users?</p>



<p>So, let’s examine the User Flow in order to better understand what happened.</p>



<p>And the results are…</p>



<p>Lines and Curves.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1024x309.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1024x309.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-300x91.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-768x232.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Useberry’s User Flow of the test</figcaption></figure>



<p>This looks a bit complex (or not!) but let’s analyze it anyhow.</p>



<p>Let’s <strong>zoom in</strong> a little bit and explain what we can see here.</p>



<figure><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-19-at-4.29.52-PM-1024x713.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-19-at-4.29.52-PM-1024x713.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-19-at-4.29.52-PM-300x209.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-19-at-4.29.52-PM-768x535.png 768w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-19-at-4.29.52-PM.png 1106w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Think of the User Flow as a table.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every <strong>cell</strong> is an <strong>incremental navigation</strong> <strong>step</strong> and every <strong>row</strong> is a <strong>screen that appeared</strong> on the specific navigation step.</p>



<p>We then <strong>group unique screens with unique navigation steps</strong> and we create the User Flow.</p>



<p>Next to every screen, you will notice a number, and some screens may have a colored number below them. </p>



<p>The number next to the screen is the number of unique users who landed on the specific screen and the number below the screen is an event. </p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/event-explanation.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/event-explanation.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/event-explanation.png 662w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/event-explanation-300x235.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px"></a></figure></div>



<p>Here at Useberry, we capture 3 different events:</p>



<p><strong>Yellow event (Skip):</strong> Number of users who skipped the task on the specific step.<br><strong>Blue event (Success):</strong> Number of users who completed the task on the specific step.<br><strong>Red event (Drop-off):</strong> Number of users who dropped-off (totally closed) the test on the specific step.</p>







<p>Now, let’s go back to our example and the results that we have obtained.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1-1024x309.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1-1024x309.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1-300x91.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1-768x232.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Click the image to enlarge</figcaption></figure>



<p>In our User Flow example, we can see that we have <strong>multiple paths</strong> that users followed to complete their task.</p>



<p>(In this specific example, we don’t have users that closed the test before it ended which is why we don’t have red events.)</p>



<p>If we look carefully at the User Flow, we realize that we have 4 different screens that have events under them, which means that we have 4 different flows.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flow-with-paths.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flow-with-paths-1024x309.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flow-with-paths-1024x309.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flow-with-paths-300x91.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flow-with-paths-768x232.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>click image to enlarge</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Optimal Path</strong></p>



<p>Clicking the”Optimal path” button we can see the most common flow that users took in order to complete their task.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/optimal.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/optimal-1024x495.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/optimal-1024x495.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/optimal-300x145.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/optimal-768x371.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Optimal path</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Oh, wait…</strong></p>



<p>Those are the users that skipped the task!</p>



<blockquote><p>The “top path” is the most common user flow. It’s the series of screens seen by your typical tester. Every app has one. But not every designer knows what it is.</p></blockquote>



<p>Namely,  4 users took the <strong>exact specific path</strong> and these users skipped the task after they landed on a specific screen.</p>



<p>Bearing in mind the expected path and seeing that the optimal path is not the same as the expected path, we can <strong>quickly</strong> figure out that we need to modify our design in order to increase the success of the test.</p>



<p><strong>Let’s go a little deeper, though</strong>.</p>



<p>If we look carefully at the screen where testers split, we can see that that’s where we need to focus.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/spllited-titles.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/spllited-titles.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/spllited-titles.png 668w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/spllited-titles-274x300.png 274w" sizes="(max-width: 668px) 100vw, 668px"></a><figcaption>Click on the image to enlarge</figcaption></figure>



<p>We have 8 users who landed on <strong>screen A</strong> and 2 users who landed on <strong>screen B</strong>. On our expected path, the <strong>screen B</strong> is the “expected” screen. The users <strong>MUST</strong> go there in order to complete the task. </p>



<p>So, we have two options – change our design in order to lead these 8 users to <strong>screen B</strong> or design “something” on <strong>screen A</strong> to satisfy our users.</p>



<p>Now let’s see where the users clicked and <strong>why they split</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>How?</strong> </p>



<p>Just click “View Heatmaps” on the specific screen.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/splitted-heatmaps-2.png" alt="" width="603" height="680" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/splitted-heatmaps-2.png 603w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/splitted-heatmaps-2-266x300.png 266w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px"><figcaption><br>By clicking heatmaps on a screen you will see where the users clicked when they were on the specific screen and the specific path step</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>And the results are…</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/heatmap-1.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/heatmap-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/heatmap-1.png 400w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/heatmap-1-156x300.png 156w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></a></figure></div>



<p><strong>Aha… Interesting! </strong></p>



<p>It seems that our testers and our potential users, in order to add a track to their wish list, first navigate through the specific track. (makes sense!)</p>



<p>Well, a possible solution to this is to satisfy our users when they land on <strong>screen B</strong>. That’s why we changed the design and added a bar with the “add to wishlist” button on the specific screen and run a new test again.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-solution.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-solution-1024x851.png" alt="" width="580" height="482" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-solution-1024x851.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-solution-300x249.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-solution-768x638.png 768w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-solution.png 1063w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px"></a><figcaption>Before – After</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>Task</strong>: Add a track to your favorite list&nbsp;<br><strong>Instructions</strong>: Navigate through the prototype and add a track to your wish list.<br><strong>Type of test:</strong> Single task<br><strong>Number of blocks used in useberry</strong>: 2 (Single Task, Thank you)<br><strong>Audience</strong>: From a Facebook group of music fans<br><strong>Number of testers</strong>: 10<br><strong>Time to get back results:</strong> 4 minutes<br><strong>Link to the test</strong>: <a href="https://app.useberry.com/preview/hbtk48wW/">https://app.useberry.com/preview/hbtk48wW/</a></p>



<p>And the results of the <strong>new </strong>test are…</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alt-version-results.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alt-version-results.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alt-version-results.png 866w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alt-version-results-300x249.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alt-version-results-768x637.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 866px) 100vw, 866px"></a></figure></div>

<p><strong>Amazing!</strong> We actually increased our conversions!</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>We managed to find an issue in something we thought was obvious and we resolved it quickly with the help of the user-flows. </p>



<p>Running tests in the design phase helps you save time and effort and solve UX issues that never even occurred to you before.</p>



<p>Maybe the results of the test are obvious but this is just a demo and an example in order to explain what user-flow looks like and how it can help you resolve UX issues.</p>



<p>With more complex prototypes and more testers, the user-flow becomes more complex, too, but we are trying to add features to make it as friendly as we possibly can – it’s up to you if you want to dig into it.</p>



<p>So, happy designing and feel free to come forward with any suggestions!</p>

<p><strong>A bonus tip – Highlight traffic through here.<br></strong>If you want to see the path that users took in order to land on a specific screen on the user-flow, just click the “highlight traffic through here” button!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A realistic look at Python web frameworks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you take a look around the blogosphere at various benchmarks for Python web frameworks, you might start to feel pretty bad about your own setup. Or, alternatively, super-hyped about the possibilities.</p><p>Consider, for instance, the incredible work of the guys at <a href="https://magic.io/blog/uvloop-blazing-fast-python-networking/">magic stack</a>, getting <strong>100,000 requests per second</strong> from <a href="https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop">uvloop</a> in a single thread. This is on par with compiled language like Go's performance.</p><p>But that benchmark doesn't really cover a fully fleshed out web framework, right? We need a lot more functionality and structure from our frameworks than reading and writing bytes. What about fully fleshed-out web-frameworks in python?</p><p>One such framework is <a href="https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic">Sanic</a>, which again has been shown to have similar performance: <strong>100,000</strong> requests per-second. Or there's <a href="https://vibora.io/">Vibora</a>. Not only does this claim to be a drop-in replacement for <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a>, but it also has its own templating engine. And it handles <strong>350,000 requests per second</strong>!</p><p>Even more mind-blowing is <a href="https://github.com/squeaky-pl/japronto">Japronto</a> which claims an insane <strong>1.2 million requests per-second</strong> in a single thread 🤯 trouncing the performance of other languages and frameworks:</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/squeaky-pl/japronto/master/benchmarks/results.png" alt="https://github.com/squeaky-pl/japronto"></p><p>Recently we've been doing a lot of work improving the performance of our Python APIs. Currently we're running <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a>, and we initially had a single question: <em>how can we serve more requests from a single worker thread? </em>But looking at these benchmarks had us asking more:</p><ol><li>Can we meaningfully compare them to our setup?</li><li>How realistic are they for a full production application?</li><li>Would we be better using one of these frameworks over Flask?</li></ol><p>In other words, how much should we trust these benchmarks? And to what extent should they influence our choice of technology?</p><p>In order to answer these questions, in this post, I benchmark a realistic Flask application along with it's <a href="https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic">Sanic</a> equivalent. I'm going to guess that most readers come from a background with one of the more "traditional" Python frameworks (<a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a> or <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>), and it's certainly more relevant to devs here at Suade Labs. For this reason, I run the Flask app in a number of different ways, to see what the best bang for our buck is: how performant can we make our application with (almost) zero changes to the code? Along the way we'll pick up some tips for the original question: <em>how can we serve more requests from a single worker thread?</em></p><p><strong>Sidenote: </strong>if you're new to Python's web frameworks, or its asynchronous libraries, take a look at [1] from the addenda at the bottom of this post for a quick explainer. This post mostly assumes you know these things.</p><h2 id="the-baseline">The baseline</h2><p>First let's run some simple "Hello, World!" benchmarks on our system to get a meaningful baseline for comparison. For reference, the Flask benchmarks on <a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r18&amp;hw=ph&amp;test=fortune&amp;l=zijzen-f">techempower</a> give 25,000 requests per second.</p><p>Here's our Flask app:</p><pre><code>app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def hello():
    if request.method == "GET":
        return "Hello, World!"

    data = request.get_json(force=True)
    try:
        return "Hello, {id}".format(**data)
    except KeyError:
        return "Missing required parameter 'id'", 400</code></pre><p>I ran it under a variety of conditions. First "raw" via <code>python app.py</code>, and then under <a href="https://gunicorn.org/">Gunicorn</a> with a single <code>sync</code> worker via <code>gunicorn -k sync app:app</code> and finally Gunicorn with a single <a href="https://github.com/gevent/gevent">gevent</a> worker via <code>gunicorn -k gevent app:app</code>. In theory Gunicorn should handle concurrency and dropped connections much better than the raw python, and using the gevent worker should allow us to do asynchronous IO without changing our code [2a]. We also ran these benchmarks under <a href="https://www.pypy.org/">PyPy</a>, which in theory should speed up any CPU-bound code without making any changes (if you haven't heard of PyPy see [2b] in the addenda below for a quick explanation and some terminology).</p><p>And what about Sanic? Well, here's the "rewrite" of our app:</p><pre><code>app = Sanic(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
async def hello(request):
    if request.method == "GET":
        return text("Hello, World!")

    data = request.json
    try:
        return text("Hello, {id}".format(**data))
    except KeyError:
        raise InvalidUsage("Missing required parameter 'id'")</code></pre><p>And here are the results:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/hello_world-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 1000w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 1161w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><div><p>Some technical details: I used Python 3.7 with the regular CPython interpreter and Python 3.6 with PyPy 7.3.3. At the time of writing, running 3.6 is the latest PyPy interpreter, and their Python 2.7 interpreter is faster in some edge cases, but as Python 2 is <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/">officially dead</a>, I don't believe it productive to benchmark. My system details are available in the addenda [3]. I used <a href="https://github.com/wg/wrk">wrk</a> to actually execute the benchmarks.</p><p>I'll break the results down in two parts. First: Sanic dominates, with 23,000 requests a second, although running our Flask app under Guncorn + gevent and PyPy does a pretty good job at keeping up. Second: what's going on with the performance range for our Flask app?</p></div><p>Under CPython, we see that using Gunicorn quadruples the number of Flask requests per second from 1,000 to 4,000 and using a gevent worker adds a mild (sub 10%) speed boost to this. The PyPy results are more impressive. In the raw test, it is churning through 3,000 requests a second; it received the same 4x speed boost from Gunicorn, getting us to 12,000 requests a second; finally with the addition of gevent, it cranks up to 17,000 requests a second, 17x more than the raw CPython version without changing a single line of code.</p><p>I was quite struck by the fact that gevent had such little effect on the CPython process - probably this is because the CPU is maxed out at this point. On the other hand, it seems that PyPy's better speed means it is still spending time waiting on system calls / IO, even under Gunicorn. Adding gevent to the mix means that it switches between concurrent connections, processing them as fast as the CPU will let it.</p><p>To get a real sense of this, I ran the benchmark whilst monitoring CPU usage. Here's a short test against the raw app under PyPy:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png 919w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>You can see that the program hops between CPU cores and rarely utilises 100% of a given core. On the other hand, here's part of a much longer test against the Gunicorn gevent worker under PyPy:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png 900w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Now it's evident that there is no switching between CPU cores (the process has become "sticky") and the individual core is being utilised to a far higher degree.</p><p><strong>Key takeaways</strong>: Sanic wins. PyPy is fast. Run your "traditional" app under Gunicorn.</p><h2 id="realistic-benchmarks">Realistic benchmarks</h2><div><p>The benchmark above, while fun, is pretty meaningless for real-world applications. Let's add some more functionality to our app!</p><p>First, we'll allow users to actually store data in a database, which we'll retrieve via an ORM (in our case <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a>, the de-facto stand-alone ORM in python). Second, we'll add input-validation to make sure our users get meaningful error messages, and that we're not accepting junk that crashes our app. Finally we'll add a response marshaller to automate the process of converting our database object to JSON.</p></div><p>We'll write a simple book store app, for a publishing house. We have a number of authors each writing zero or more books in several genres. For simplicity, each book has only a single author, but can have multiple genres - for example we could have a book which is in both the "Existential Fiction" and "Beatnik Poetry" categories. We're going to add 1 million authors to our database and roughly 10 million books. [4]</p><p>Our SQLAlchemy models look a little like this:</p>
<pre><code>class Author(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(UUIDType, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)
    ... # snip!

class Book(db.Model):
    author_id = db.Column(
        UUIDType, db.ForeignKey("author.id"), nullable=False, index=True
    )
    author = db.relationship("Author", backref="books")
    ... # snip!
</code></pre>
<p>To marshal these, we use <a href="https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Marshmallow</a>, which is a popular Python marshalling library. Here's an example of the Marshmallow model for the Author overview:</p>
<pre><code>class Author(Schema):
    id = fields.Str(dump_only=True)
    name = fields.Str(required=True)
    country_code = EnumField(CountryCodes, required=True)
    email = fields.Str(required=True)
    phone = fields.Str(required=True)
    contact_address = fields.Str(required=True)
    contract_started = fields.DateTime(format="iso")
    contract_finished = fields.DateTime(format="iso")
    contract_value = fields.Integer()
</code></pre>
<p>In our endpoints these are used for validating input and returning results like so:</p>
<pre><code>@bp.route("/author", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def author():
    """View all authors, or create a new one."""

    if request.method == "GET":
        args = validate_get(marshallers.LimitOffsetSchema())
        limit = args["limit"]
        offset = args["offset"]

        authors = Author.query.limit(limit).offset(offset).all()
        return jsonify(marshallers.authors.dump(authors))

    if request.method == "POST":
        author = Author(**validate_post(marshallers.author))

        db.session.add(author)
        db.session.commit()

        return jsonify({"id": author.id})
</code></pre>
<p>The full source code can be viewed in the <a href="https://github.com/olliemath/async_python">GitHub repo</a>. Here, the thing to note is that <code>marshallers.foo</code> is an instance of a <a href="https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Marshmallow</a> schema, which can be used both to validate a Foo input, for instance in a POST request, as well as to marshal Foo instances ready for returning as JSON.</p>
<p>In order to actually perform asynchronous database requests, some fancy footwork is required with patching libraries, which depends on which postgres connector you use. SQLAlchemy does not support this out of the box, and in fact its primary developer has a great post arguing that <a href="https://techspot.zzzeek.org/2015/02/15/asynchronous-python-and-databases/">an async ORM is not always a great idea</a>. Juicy technical details in addenda [5], but beware that just using a Gunicorn gevent worker will not necessarily get you what you want.</p><p>PyPy tends to suffer a performance hit when using C-extensions and libraries instead of pure python, conversely CPython should get a performance boost from the C-based libs. To take account of this I tested two different underlying database connectors: both <a href="https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2">psycopg2</a> and a …</p></div></section></article></div></div>

    <div><div><p>The intensification of dairy farming has been a concern of ours for many years, so we’ve been working hard to come up with a different solution. Our big idea? A new method of dairy farming that keeps the calves with their mothers to suckle. Our <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/ethical-dairy-system">ethical dairy model</a> is based around treating the animals, the land, our environment and the people who work here with respect and kindness.</p></div></div>
<div>
  <div><div><div><div about="" typeof="">
  <div>
    <div><div><div><p>In traditional dairy farms calves are removed from their mothers within a few hours of their birth - the stress this places on the cow is clear. So we wanted to find a way to keep calves with the cows and still have a financially viable farm. Put simply, we don’t want to have to choose between doing what’s right and staying in business.</p>
<p>As an organic dairy farm for more than twenty years our cows have already benefitted from some of the highest welfare standards in the UK, but we knew we could do even better. We built a new dairy, specially designed to house calves with their mothers, and we trialled the full cow with calf system for the first time in 2012. It taught us a lot, but financially cost us an awful lot.</p>
<p><span>However, the impact it made on cow contentment was staggering. All the animals were noticeably calmer and far more confident. <span>&nbsp;</span>After two to three months the calves became like teenagers, they loved playing with their pals and really only came back to mum when they wanted food!</span></p>
<p><span></span>We are determined to make our radical new model of dairy farming work, and by purchasing cheese from The Ethical Dairy you are helping to support it.</p>

<p>We are still at the early stages of The Ethical Dairy project, but our new approach to dairy farming has already led to huge reductions in the use of <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/power-nature">antibiotics</a>, increases in <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/biodiversity-ethical-dairy">biodiversity</a> and <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/healthier-winter">healthier</a>, happier cows. Compared to an average dairy farm, already The Ethical Dairy has:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Cut greenhouse gas emissions by more than half</li>
<li>Reduced <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/coo-poo-power">energy</a> use by more than half</li>

<li>Increased the net amount of food in our <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/politics-food-production">food system</a> by 80%</li>
<li>Exceeded the highest standards of animal welfare</li>
</ul>
<p>The Ethical Dairy has been supported in its journey by many individuals through our crowdfunding campaign in the autumn of 2018, and by public funding, such as Dumfries and Galloway LEADER which is helping us to attend trade shows, events, and to market and promote our products.

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p><a href="https://console.dev/">Console</a> is starting as a free weekly newsletter highlighting the best tools for developers. We want to know how our list is performing, which means keeping an eye on some key metrics like active subscribers and unsubscribe rates. We can log into Mailchimp to see this data, but I wanted to get a quick daily update rather than forming a habit of constantly logging in.</p><p>We <a href="https://basecamp.com/guides/group-chat-problems">default to asynchronous communication</a> and use the chat room built into <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a> for informal socialising or posting non-critical links and comments. I check it each morning, so it seemed like a good place to post a status update.</p><p>Like most chat products <a href="https://github.com/basecamp/bc3-api/blob/master/sections/chatbots.md#create-a-line">Basecamp has a bot API</a> to send arbitrary messages into the chat. It is therefore easy to use <a href="https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/docs/fundamentals/">the Mailchimp API</a> to <a href="https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/api/lists/get-list-info/">pull the stats</a> and post them into Basecamp. This code just needs to run every morning.</p><p>Keeping <a href="https://blog.console.dev/console-tech-stack-2021/">our tech stack</a> as simple as possible is a priority. We don't have a complex product and dealing with servers, OS updates, database replication, etc is something we will put off as long as possible! However, a chat bot has to run somewhere. This is the perfect use-case for a serverless function - just write the code and let the platform deal with the infrastructure maintenance.</p><h2 id="azure-vs-google-vs-aws">Azure vs Google vs AWS</h2><p>I have <a href="https://davidmytton.blog/who-has-the-best-serverless-platform/">tried AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Azure Functions</a>, and have several personal utility functions running on both Google and Azure. Whilst I have been impressed with Google Cloud's database products, they are still behind when it comes to the breadth of functionality in their serverless functions product. Google doesn't support Rust and has no concept of custom runtimes like AWS and Azure do.</p><p>This meant it was down to AWS vs Azure. Both have excellent documentation, lots of language SDKs, and a large ecosystem of developers. However, I prefer the Azure web portal, like how they build in public on GitHub, and <a href="https://davidmytton.blog/fighting-over-who-has-the-greenest-public-cloud/">rate them best for environmental sustainability</a>. AWS is the more popular platform and Lambda/Azure Functions are competitive. I just prefer Azure.</p><h2 id="creating-a-python-serverless-bot">Creating a Python serverless bot</h2><p>I have been writing Python for over 10 years, so it was the default choice to create a simple serverless bot. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-python">Azure has native Python support</a>, the Basecamp API takes a simple HTTP POST, and <a href="https://github.com/mailchimp/mailchimp-marketing-python">Mailchimp has an official Python SDK</a>. </p><p>This meant that within a few hours I had written a function, created the Azure Resource Manager template, and configured GitHub Actions to automatically deploy on push. The bot was running and delivering us stats each morning.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/campfire-totorobot-python.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/campfire-totorobot-python.png 600w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/campfire-totorobot-python.png 825w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Python bot posting our daily Mailchimp stats into Basecamp.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="why-port-to-rust">Why port to Rust?</h2><p>Over Christmas I usually leave London to visit my family, however <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-55380644">the change in COVID-19 rules</a> meant that I could no longer leave the city. With some extra time, particularly in the quiet period between Christmas and New Year, I ended up spending several days playing around with <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>.</p><p>Although it has been around since 2010, Rust has become particularly popular in the last few years. <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted">Stack Overflow have listed it as the most loved language</a> since 2016.</p><p>I won't go into the standard Rust pitch of "better safety, concurrency, performance" - you can find detailed Rust <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03382-2">vs</a> Language X <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2015/5/27/rust-for-pythonistas/">posts</a> <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang/rust-vs-go">elsewhere</a> - but I did want to write up my experience as a Rust newbie.</p><h3 id="reason-1-fun-and-interesting">Reason 1: Fun and interesting</h3><p>My main reason for porting from Python to Rust was that it was fun and interesting! I like Python (which sits at #3 in the "most loved" 2020 ranking) because it is easy to start writing code and you can get things done quickly. It also enforces a particular coding style which means more consistent layout, spacing, indenting, etc.</p><p>Python doesn't make you think about concepts like static typing and memory management because it handles it for you. Rust is very different. It forces you to consider types, ensure all return cases are handled consistently, understand scoping, and many other things which are absent in Python. This is by design because it makes the resulting code much more robust.</p><p>Rust uses the concept of "<a href="https://sled.rs/errors">correctness</a>". It's not that Rust is "right" and Python is "wrong", but forcing you think about these concepts, and enforcing them before code will compile, helps to avoid errors:</p><blockquote>almost all (92%) of the catastrophic system failures are the result of incorrect handling of non-fatal errors explicitly signaled in software.<p>- <a href="http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~yuan/papers/failure_analysis_osdi14.pdf">Simple Testing Can Prevent Most Critical Failures: An Analysis of Production Failures in Distributed Data-intensive Systems</a></p></blockquote><p>The number of times I have found bugs in my Python code due to silly mistakes like typos or not handling a particular error case makes me appreciate Rust's approach. Better to invest more time in development rather than finding bugs and errors once code has been shipped to production. </p><p>I still need to write more extensive unit tests and mock the external API calls but tests are a core language feature. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-03-test-organization.html">Developers are encourged</a> to write tests inside the source that is being tested, with integration tests in a "tests" directory.</p><h3 id="reason-2-portability">Reason 2: Portability</h3><p>Neither AWS Lambda nor Azure Functions have native support for Rust, but they both support Custom <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-custom.html">Runtimes</a>/<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-other">Handlers</a>. This allows you to build a generic web endpoint which, if it can handle to standard HTTP requests and return a standard HTTP response, can be executed by the platform.</p><p>(This is true for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-custom-handlers#http-only-function">an HTTP triggered function on Azure</a>. Getting into more platform-specific function types, like a Timer or Queue trigger, means relying more on the platform features. This makes it more difficult to port away, but not impossible).</p><p>All languages have a range of frameworks that help building web endpoints, often with an embedded web server. Rust has <a href="https://actix.rs/">Actix</a> and <a href="https://rocket.rs/">Rocket</a>, <a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2020-07-04-choosing-a-rust-web-framework-2020-edition/">amongst others</a>. By creating generic HTTP endpoints, the application can be run anywhere. AWS Lambda has <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime">some experimental Rust language bindings</a>, but creating a set of generic web endpoints is better because it is not then tied to a specific platform.</p><p>This is not unique to Rust. Python has <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask</a> (or <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, for a more "batteries included" approach). However, Rust differs because it is a statically compiled language. This means the output is a binary that runs entirely independently, only requiring the system libc implementation. If you <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/platform-and-target-support/musl-support-for-fully-static-binaries.html">compile it with a musl target</a> it becomes 100% static and will therefore run on any Linux OS. </p><p>Statically compiled binaries have all their dependencies included executable. This means the binary should continue to run "forever", even if the platform changes. Indeed, because the application is completely isolated and separate from the platform, there is no reliance on specific system-installed packages. Both can be updated independent of each other. This can be partly achieved using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html">Python Virtual Environments</a>, but they are complex and have developer overhead (<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0582/">PEP-0582</a> aims to fix that). Static compilation is a more robust approach.</p><p>It is currently convenient to run this bot on Azure, but it would be trivial to move it to AWS or a generic web server. Using <a href="https://upx.github.io/">upx</a> to <a href="https://github.com/svenstaro/upx-action">compress the executable</a> means the final binary with a full embedded web server is just 2.5MB. This application is so lightweight it could even run on a Raspberry Pi in the office - I'd just need to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html">compile it for ARM</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/compressed-binary.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/compressed-binary.png 600w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/compressed-binary.png 670w"><figcaption>The final 100% static, upx compressed binary. Only 2.5MB.</figcaption></figure><p>This is definitely overkill for a chatbot project. There is no tangible benefit to statically compiling a few hundred lines of Rust vs deploying the same length Python code to Azure Functions. There are only a couple of dependencies! </p><p>But this is a great test project to learn how it works (see Reason #1 above). Internal tools tend to be built quickly and with less polish than software you intend to ship to customers. Yet they often last the longest in production because of how widely used they become. In some organizations it can be hard to justify spending expensive developer time on such projects, so investing in maintainabilty upfront is worth it.</p><h3 id="reason-3-developer-tooling">Reason 3: Developer tooling</h3><p>The overall experience of writing Rust is made much more enjoyable because of the developer tooling. Everything revolves around <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html">Cargo</a> which makes documentation, dependency management, linting, testing, and builds all part of the core language. Installing Rust using the standard rustup command also includes Cargo and there are several useful extras like <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy">Clippy</a> and <a href="https://github.com/RustSec/cargo-audit">Audit</a>.</p><p>This is a big win for developers because everything you need is available out of the box. Third-party packages can be found in the <a href="https://crates.io/">Crate registry</a>. The equivalent in Python, <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPI</a> and <a href="https://packaging.python.org/key_projects/#pip">pip</a>, does not feel as slick and wasn't even included with Python when I first started coding it (when setuptools/easy_install were the primary method of package management). You also have to be careful to use a Python virtual environment if you have a system managed installation of Python, otherwise you will end up installing system-level dependencies.</p><p>I'm a vim user so the official <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust.vim">rust.vim plugin</a> gives me autocomplete and in-editor checks, but the output from Cargo (warnings and errors) is very helpful and pinpointing problems. <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy">rust-clippy</a> is fun, too.</p><p>Where Python has an advantage is the number of libraries. PyPI has over 280,000 packages whereas Cargo has 53,000. Quantity is not an indication of quality, and Python has been stable longer, but it is reasonable to expect vendors to provide official Python SDKs. That is less common with Rust.</p><h2 id="challenges-learning-rust">Challenges learning Rust</h2><p>I wrote the Python bot in a few hours but it took me several days to get the Rust port working. This would be hard to justify if it wasn't a learning project, but everyone gets faster with experience. I had to learn not just a new language but also how to properly cross-compile for a different platform. Here are my notes on some of those challenges:</p><h3 id="language-challenges">Language challenges</h3><p>There are several features which make Rust robust, safe, and correct, but require a shift in mindset if you're used to other languages. For example, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html">the …</a></p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

			<p>GameStop Corp (GME) continues to rally today and is now up over +370% in 2021. GME shorts and longs are in a knockout battle being waged in the stock market as well asocial media platforms. Both sides are holding their ground with strong conviction, but in the end, one side will be the outright winner, and in the later rounds of this prize fight the long shareholders are way ahead on points.</p>
<p>GME short interest is $5.51 billion; 71.79 million shares shorted; 139.57% SI % Float; 58.26% S3 SI % Float; 31% stock borrow fee on existing shorts and new shorts are paying over 80% fee.</p>
<p>GME has now climbed to #12 in the short interest league table:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.shortsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Capture-9.png" alt="" width="641" height="465" srcset="https://www.shortsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Capture-9.png 641w, https://www.shortsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Capture-9-585x424.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px"></p>
<p>A year ago, GME short interest was $276 million; 63.98 million shares shorted (stock price was $4.32); 104.01% SI % Float; 50.98% S3 SI % Float. While shares shorted only increased by +12%, total dollars as risk have risen by +1,900%. A scarcity in stock borrow availability has limited the increase in shares shorted, but even as mark-to market losses we are not seeing a decrease in overall shares shorted. In fact, GME has the highest level of SI % Float for any equity worldwide (with short interest over $100 million).</p>
<p>GME is #1 in highest Short Interest % of Float:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.shortsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Capture-10.png" alt="" width="640" height="254" srcset="https://www.shortsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Capture-10.png 640w, https://www.shortsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Capture-10-585x232.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></p>
<p>GME’s SI % of float is over 100%, which is illogical as you cannot get five quarts of milk out of a gallon jug. In actuality, GME’s short interest is 58.26% if we include the “synthetic longs” that are created by short sales in the float calculation. A portion of these “synthetic longs” become lendable shares as they settle in&nbsp; lending programs (mutual funds and ETF providers), marginable retail accounts and rehypothicatable hedge fund accounts. Short selling therefore not only provides added daily trading liquidity but also stock loan liquidity which supports not only the ability to execute Alpha generating short trades but also liquidity for portfolio hedging strategies and derivative (option\swap) hedging.</p>
<p>Over the last 30 days we saw shares shorted increase by +1.53 million shares, worth $117 million, an increase of +2.18% as its stock price rose +281%. Over the last 7 days we saw shares shorted increase by +900 thousand shares, worth $69 million, an increase of +1.27% as its stock price rose +116%.</p>
<p>We are still seeing a short squeeze on existing older shorts, with these more value-based short sellers trimming or closing their positions due to large mark-to-market losses. But, for every short position that is closed, and stock borrow returned we are seeing extremely strong demand from new short sellers looking to initiate new short positions and capitalize on an Icarus like fall for a stock price that has soared too high. Brokers and Prime Brokers are looking into every nook and cranny to satisfy short selling demand.</p>
<p>Shorting GME has not been a profitable trade for short sellers. Shorts were down -$968 million in net-of-financing mark-to-market losses in 2020 and are already down -$5.05 billion in 2021, which includes a loss of -$876 million on today’s +16% intraday move (stock price $89.00).</p>
<p>At the moment, the prize fight is between momentum longs and momentum shorts, with the longs way ahead on points but shorts are looking for a knock-out in the later rounds. While long buyers are continuing to throw punches by continuing to bid up stock prices, short sellers do not have many haymakers left to throw as stock borrow supply curtails new short selling activity in size.</p>

<p>If GME’s stock price remains at these levels or continues to rise, both value and momentum shorts will be squeezed out of their positions and GME’s stock price will get the added boost of short buy-to-covers standing shoulder to shoulder with long buyers in driving up GME’s stock price. But if GME’s stock price faulters, shorts will hold on to their positions and scramble for any slivers of stock loan borrows they can garner as long buyers begin exiting their positions in order to lock in their recent outsized mark-to-market profits. If long shareholders do begin selling, there may be an avalanche of long sellers hitting the tape since no-one wants to see their mark-to-market profits melt away and be the last ones holding the bag. Either way, this is a heavy weight fight worth watching.</p>

    <p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/hermetic_world.jpg" alt="The world description from an hermetic point of view was always convoluted and full of retrospective to enforce meaning" loading="lazy"></p>

<p><em>The year of the Linux desktop is coming</em>, and it looks like a piñata of
micro-services. Let’s break it and see the candies inside.</p>

<ul>
  <li>systemd core — the building block framework abstracting basic functionalities</li>
  <li>A universal package manager with a single reposotiry where anyone can push</li>
  <li>flatpak/appimage/snap — containarized applications</li>
  <li>polkit and apparmor — granular security</li>
  <li>systemd-homed — movable home with an immutable base system</li>
  <li>wayland compositors — the graphical environment</li>
  <li>pipewire — media pipeline</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re bored you can leave now, that’s it. Otherwise, let me get more
ideas out, but nothing surprising to anyone that has been following RedHat,
the freedesktop.org, and systemd.</p>

<p>The key innovation of the picture I lay above is that every
layer in the system is now isolated and communicate with one
another through d-bus services. D-bus is <a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2020/07/06/dbus-polkit.html">fantastic in its own
right</a> and good at
abstracting functionalities.</p>

<p>All of these pieces need one another. Wayland compositors need pipewire
to be able to access media hardware, and pipewire needs polkit (or
similar mechanism) to select who can do that. Similarly, containarized
applications access the rest of the system through systemd services,
polkit, and pipewire.</p>

<p>What this leads to is a base system that is stable, a solid framework
to build on. The home is transportable inside a systemd-homed, along
with the containarized apps, proprietary or not.</p>

<p>The deep secret insider info I got tells me that this is a giant scheme
to get us all in a vendor lock-in. I can lie, this is the internet.<br>
Or better (or worse?), this is a new Android ecosystem.</p>

<p>Who’s going to nag when this is all done in the open; when the open
source movers are the implementers of the de-facto implementations;
when they keep piling the standards until nobody can follow them.</p>

<p>I believe the direction the Linux desktop is going towards will
bring more incentives for investments. Distributions uniqueness
won’t matter anymore as they’ll be centralized around a “store”
where devs will push directly. (<a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2020/03/29/distro-pkgs.html">see previous post about distros
roles</a>)</p>

<p>Leave a comment if you weren’t aware of this vision of how distros will
look in the future.</p>

  2021-01-27
</p>
<p>This is an update of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/28.html">the popular 2018 FAQ</a>.  Details
have changed, but the spirit of the project is the same.  If you've already
read this, see <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2021/01/philosophy-design.html">yesterday's post</a> for more color.</p>
<p>Whenever I announce a new <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=oil-release#oil-release">Oil release</a>, some readers are confused
by the project.</p>
<p>This post explains the project's motivation from several perspectives.  Because
Unix shell is an old and successful technology, there are many ways of looking
at it.</p>
 
<a name="introduction"></a>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Before explaining <em>why</em> I created Oil, let's review <em>what</em> it is.  You can
think of a Unix shell in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>As a text-based <strong>user interface</strong>.  You communicate with the operating
system by typing commands.</li>
<li>As a <strong>language</strong>.  It has variables, functions, and loops.  Shell programs
are text files that start with <code>#!/bin/sh</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this document, we'll think of Unix shells as languages.  The Oil project
actually has <strong>two languages</strong>: OSH and Oil.  Let's define these terms, along with
two others for context:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=posix-shell-spec#posix-shell-spec">POSIX shell</a> is a language defined by a standards body.
For example, Debian Linux and FreeBSD are both Unix operating systems that
provide POSIX shells.  Nearly all shells are POSIX-compatible: <code>bash</code>,
<code>dash</code>, <code>ksh</code>, etc.</li>
<li>GNU <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> is the most popular shell implementation in the world.
It was first released in 1989, and implements the POSIX standard plus many
extensions.  It's the default shell on most Linux distributions, runs on BSD
Unix variants, <a href="https://scriptingosx.com/2019/06/moving-to-zsh/">used to ship on Mac OS X</a>, and <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265900/everything-you-can-do-with-windows-10s-new-bash-shell/">runs on
Windows</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH</a> is a shell implementation that's part of the Oil project.
It's compatible with both POSIX and <code>bash</code>.  The goal is to run <strong>existing
shell scripts</strong>.  It's done so <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/15.html">since January 2018</a>, and has matured
in <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/releases.html">many regular releases</a> since then.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=oil-language#oil-language">Oil language</a> is a brand new, incompatible, shell
language.  The idea is to fix more than four decades of accumulated warts in
the Unix shell.  Many Unix users are angry that shell is so difficult, and
Oil aims to fix that.  (Example: Why is <code>x=1</code> different than <code>x = 1</code>?)</li>
</ul>
<p>More about the Oil language:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compared to POSIX shell and bash, Oil is <strong>easier to learn, write, and
debug</strong>.  It's designed for programmers who know Python, JavaScript, or Ruby,
but avoid shell.</li>
<li>Oil will do everything bash can, <strong>and more</strong>.  For example, it will have
dynamic types and structured data, not just strings.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/01/simplest-explanation.html">The Simplest Explanation of Oil</a>
shows examples of the language.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/idioms.html">Oil Language Idioms</a> compares
old shell code and new Oil code.  Importantly, the same interpreter runs both
styles.  It's useful to think of OSH and Oil separately, but there's a
<strong>gradual transition</strong> between the two.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best description of the project is on <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/">the home page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oil is our upgrade path from <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> to a better language and runtime.</p>
</blockquote>
<a name="frequently-asked-questions"></a>
<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p>This section paraphrases questions I've received and summarizes the answers.
In most cases, I link to the original comment thread, which you can read for
details.</p>
<a name="how-is-oil-different-than-bash-or-zsh"></a>
<h3>How is Oil different than <code>bash</code> or <code>zsh</code>?</h3>
<p>Oil is taking shell seriously as a <strong>programming language</strong>, rather than
treating it as a text-based UI that can be abused to write programs.</p>
<p>To see why this is valuable, consider these two groups of shell users:</p>
<ol>
<li>People who use shell to type a few commands here and there.</li>
<li>People who write scripts, which may get into the hundreds or even thousands
of lines.</li>
</ol>
<p>Oil is aimed at group 2.  If you're in group 1, there's admittedly <strong>no
reason</strong> to use it right now.</p>
<p>However, group 2 writes scripts for group 1 to use!  So I believe the benefits
of Oil will eventually bubble up.</p>
<p>In other words, I'm building a <strong>solid foundation</strong> for a few more decades of
shell usage.</p>

</ul>
<a name="i-dont-understand-why-not-use-a-different-a-programming-language"></a>
<h3>I don't understand.  Why not use a different a programming language?</h3>
<p>It's important to be compatible with existing code.  You might not personally
use shell as a programming language, but all Unix users still rely on big shell
programs.  It's often used at build time, but it's still used at runtime too,
e.g. on embedded Linux devices.</p>
<p>Some of this code is old, but much of it is <strong>new</strong>.  It's not a small amount
of code, either.  Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, a popular cluster manager from Google (released around 2014),
has <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.3.0/test/wild.wwz/cloud/kubernetes/index.html">48,000+ lines</a> of shell in its repo.</li>
<li>Many distros use the <a href="https://github.com/scop/bash-completion">bash-completion</a> project for interactive completions,
and it has <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.3.0/test/wild.wwz/shell/bash-completion/index.html">26,000 lines</a> of shell.</li>
<li>More examples: <a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/The-Biggest-Shell-Programs-in-the-World">The Biggest Shell Programs in the
World</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/7lsajn/oil_shell_03_release/drom6q4/">Original question and answer</a> (reddit.com)</p>
<a name="shouldnt-we-discourage-people-from-writing-shell-scripts"></a>
<h3>Shouldn't we discourage people from writing shell scripts?</h3>
<p>There are three problems with that:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It won't work</strong>.  It would be like trying to convince people who are paid
to write PHP not to write PHP.  Many people have wasted breath on that, but
important sites like Wikipedia are still written in <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">hundreds of thousands
of lines of PHP</a>.</li>
<li>Even if a new line of shell never gets written, there will still be a <strong>huge
installed base</strong> of shell scripts that you may need to understand (e.g. when
they don't work).</li>
<li>Shell is <strong>still the best tool</strong> for many jobs.  Most new "cloud" projects
rely on Linux system images, in VMs or containers, and shell is the ideal
language for creating such images.   Even if you use a framework like Chef
or Docker, you're still using bits of shell.</li>
</ol>
<a name="shouldnt-scripts-over-100-lines-be-rewritten-in-python-or-ruby"></a>
<h3>Shouldn't scripts over 100 lines be rewritten in Python or Ruby?</h3>
<p>That's a reasonable choice in some circumstances.  If everyone on your dev team
knows Python, maintaining a shell script can be more costly than maintaining a
Python script.</p>
<p>However, Python and Ruby aren't good shell replacements in general.  Shell is a
domain-specific language for dealing with <strong>concurrent processes</strong> and the
<strong>file system</strong>.  But Python and Ruby have too much abstraction over these
concepts, sometimes in the name of portability (e.g. to Windows).  They hide
what's really going on.</p>
<p>I encountered a nice blog post, <a href="https://medium.com/capital-one-developers/bashing-the-bash-replacing-shell-scripts-with-python-d8d201bc0989">Replacing Shell Scripts with
Python</a>, which, in my opinion, inadvertently proves the
opposite point.  The Python version is longer and has more dependencies.  In
other words, it's more difficult to write and maintain.</p>
<p>Also see the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2021/01/philosophy-design.html#the-biggest-misconception-shell-xor-python">The Biggest Misconception: Shell XOR Python</a> in <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2021/01/philosophy-design.html">yesterday's
post</a>.</p>

<a name="are-you-reinventing-perl"></a>
<h3>Are you reinventing Perl?</h3>
<p>It's true that Perl is closer to shell than Python and Ruby are.  For example,
the <code>perl -pie</code> idiom can take the place of <code>awk</code> and <code>sed</code>.  However, Perl isn't
an acceptable shell either:</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn't have true pipelines (of processes).  I believe you have to "shell
out" for this.</li>
<li>It doesn't have a concept of file descriptor state.  How do you write the
equivalent of <code>my_shell_func 2&gt; err.txt</code>, where <code>my_shell_func</code> can invoke
both functions and external commands?</li>
<li>Perl has a function called <code>grep()</code>, but the real <code>grep</code> is better for many
problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perl has been around for more than 30 years, and hasn't replaced shell.  It
hasn't replaced <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> either.</li>
<li>Perl 6 and Python 3 are both less-suited to shell-like problems than their
predecessors.  In other words, we still need a new shell.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it's true that, in some respects, Oil is retreading the same ground as
Perl.  But Oil is more faithful to shell, and its syntax uses fewer punctuation
characters.  In other words, it's less like "line noise".</p>
<p>Threads:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/7lsajn/oil_shell_03_release/drp7jv6/">Perl vs Shell</a> (reddit)</li>
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16228941">Are you reinventing Perl?</a> (Hacker News)</li>
</ul>
<a name="im-still-angry-and-i-dont-want-you-to-create-a-new-shell"></a>
<h3>I'm still angry, and I don't want you to create a new shell.</h3>
<p>You might be angry because you had to maintain a nasty shell script written by
a coworker.</p>
<p>If that's the case, you should be helping Oil succeed!  The only way to "kill
bash" is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reimplement it, then</li>
<li>Gradually migrate away from it.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is analogous to how Facebook is moving away from PHP by developing a
similar, but cleaner, language called <a href="http://hacklang.org/">Hack</a>.</p>
<p>Perl, Python, and Ruby have all existed for over 25 years, but they haven't
replaced shell.  New shell scripts are being written every day.</p>

</ul>
<p>(Oil also has some similarity to <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>, which smoothed over some of
JavaScript's rough edges and added syntactic sugar, but didn't stray from its
core execution model.  CoffeeScript was a success because it influenced
subsequent versions of JavaScript.)</p>
<a name="should-i-limit-myself-to-posix-shell-scripts"></a>
<h3 id="limit-to-posix">Should I limit myself to POSIX shell scripts?</h3>
<p>I've seen this suggestion a lot, and there are entire books devoted to it.  If
your script is <strong>small</strong>, it may be a reasonable goal.</p>
<p>For bigger programs, limiting yourself to POSIX is not just inconvenient, it's
also an ill-defined and virtually untestable concept.  Evidence:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Debian project created a minimal shell variant called <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash">dash</a>, which
replaced <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>.  However, <code>dash</code> and the <a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/#scripts">Debian Policy on Shell
Scripts</a> both allow non-POSIX features, like <code>local</code>.  Local
variables are essential for writing maintainable shell scripts, but POSIX
doesn't mention them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most shells <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-bash/2018-01/msg00000.html">parse assignment builtins differently than other
builtins</a>, but the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=posix-grammar#posix-grammar">POSIX shell grammar</a>
has no notion of an assignment.  This issue surfaced as early as 2010, but as
of 2018, it's not in a published spec.</p>
<p>This issue <strong>isn't theoretical</strong> — <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash">dash</a> differ in
practice, but POSIX doesn't specify which is correct.</p>
<p>In other words, POSIX is incomplete and out of date.  (However, I've
discovered that shells are highly conformant with respect to things the
standard <strong>does</strong> specify.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As of 2021, I believe that OSH is a "better POSIX".  POSIX is a <strong>descriptive</strong>
specification and not a <strong>normative</strong> one. That means that it's an observation
of how popular shells like <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=ksh#ksh">ksh</a> and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> happened to behave at a certain
time.  In other words, it's a compromise.</p>
<p>Similarly, OSH is based on <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/06/22.html">extensive testing</a> of the behavior of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>,
<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash">dash</a>, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=mksh#mksh">mksh</a>, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=zsh#zsh">zsh</a>, and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=busybox#busybox">busybox</a> <code>ash</code>.  That is, it uses the
same philosophy as POSIX, but it specifies more of the language.  Roughly
speaking, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=spec-test#spec-test">spec tests</a> are an <strong>executable specification</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-bash/2018-01/msg00002.html">Tilde Expansion</a>: Another case where shells diverge in practice, but
POSIX is silent.</li>
</ul>

<a name="how-can-you-design-a-good-language-on-top-of-shell"></a>
<h3>How can you design a good language on top of shell?</h3>
<p>POSIX shell has global options that affect parsing and execution like <code>set -o noglob</code>.  And <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> extends them with options like <code>shopt -s lastpipe</code>.</p>
<p>Oil continues in the same vein, adding several shell options under <code>s…</code></p></div>

            The Culture War: Iain M. Banks’s Billionaire Fans    </h3>                    
<h4><strong>Why Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos love Iain M. Banks’ anarcho-communist space opera</strong>.</h4>



<p><strong>by Kurt Schiller</strong></p>



<p>Explicitly ideological fiction is as old as fiction itself. From ancient steles that boasted unconvincingly of the glorious defeat of the Sea Peoples to the biased histories of that ancient greek fabulist Herodotus, humans have always had a tendency to entangle ideology and entertainment.</p>



<p>And if anything, the last hundred years have only seen this tendency grow. Fiction—whether the written word or newer mediums—has remained a popular standard-bearer for ideologies as diverse as technocratic liberalism (<em>The West Wing</em>), free market right-libertarianism (<em>Atlas Shrugged</em>, <em>The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress</em>), socialism (<em>The Jungle</em>, <em>The Iron Heel</em>), and even violent white supremacy (<em>The Turner Diaries</em>, <em>The Camp of the Saints</em>). And in the 21st century, the ideological implications of media consumption have become as micro-targeted as the media themselves: if you are a “true American patriot”, you might consume such jingoistic potboilers as <em>13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi </em>or the suburbs-vs-antifa thriller <em>The Reliant</em>. If you are a god-fearing evangelical, perhaps <em>Assassin 33 A.D.</em> or the Kevin Sorbo-fronted <em>God’s Not Dead </em>series are more your speed. Seeking to seize the means? Perhaps you can first seize a controller and dig into <em>Tonight We Riot</em> or Disco Elysium.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="460" height="276" src="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iain-banks.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iain-banks.jpg 460w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iain-banks-300x180.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px"></figure></div>



<p>Meanwhile, the reverse has also become true: “If a particular piece of media reeks of ideological impurity,” the conventional wisdom seems to go, “why bother? Why would you let those toxic ideas into your head?”</p>



<p>For all that these notions of ideological contagion and symbology are hilariously overblown, there’s some truth to the matter. At times, reading or watching long-form fiction from someone to whom you are ideologically opposed can feel exhausting, draining, aggravating, and ultimately a bit futile—like being at a party where you simply don’t like anyone, don’t care about the discussions, and are annoyed at the food. There’s much to be gained by engaging with our rhetorical opponents… but, frankly, only up to a point.</p>



<p>What then are we to take from the distinct and quite public fascination of the two richest men in the world—Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, together worth more than $375 billion—with the sci-fi works of Iain M. Banks, an avowedly socialist author who set his far-future fiction in what might best be described as a post-scarcity, anarcho-communist utopia; a world where your Bezoses and your Musks are not just irrelevant, but actively sought out and disempowered by a society comprised of property-less workers and all-caring, mostly-benevolent A.I.s?</p>



<p>*  *  *  *  *</p>



<p>Iain M. Banks’s <em>Culture </em>series—consisting of 10 largely standalone novels and a handful of short stories published between 1987 and the author’s death in 2013—charts the intrigues, impacts, and subterfuges of a group of space-faring, far-future transhumans called The Culture.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In some ways, it’s an almost archetypal space opera. Tough-as-nails soldiers and shady sci-fi diplomats wage war across a variety of fantastical planets and megastructures. Massive, high-tech ships piloted by ultra-powerful self-aware A.I. called Minds have super-science duels among the stars. There are assassinations, revolutions, mass battles with hundreds of ships that play out on a grand scale (while taking only a fraction of a second in objective time).</p>



<p>At first glance, it seems like exactly what you’re imagining when you hear the phrase “space opera,” and so of course two super-wealthy spaceflight-and-sci-fi aficionados would be fans, right? After all, both men own private spaceflight contractors (Musk’s SpaceX and Bezos’s Blue Origin) and speak often of mankind’s future among the stars, with Musk <a href="https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/"><strong>proposing a mission to Mars</strong></a> and Bezos <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/11/18564655/blue-origin-jeff-bezos-space-moon-new-glenn"><strong>pitching a return to the moon and other intrasystem exploration</strong></a>. Seeking the stars seems to be in their blood (assuming it hasn’t been completely replaced with <a href="https://bloodknife.com/buy-happiness-here/"><strong>Soylent and whatever nootropics billionaires get</strong></a>).</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-12.01.23-AM.png" alt="" width="438" height="576" srcset="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-12.01.23-AM.png 536w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-12.01.23-AM-228x300.png 228w" sizes="(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px"></figure></div>



<p>Both men have found ways to conspicuously show their fandom: Musk by <a href="https://www.tor.com/2015/01/23/elon-musk-iain-m-banks-just-read-the-instructions/"><strong>naming SpaceX rockets after Banks’s tongue-in-cheek Culture ships</strong></a> (“Just Read The Instructions,” “Of Course I Still Love You”) and a “brain interface” loosely patterned after the Culture’s neural laces; Bezos by attempting to bankroll a big-budget TV series based on the books, although this latter effort was unceremoniously canceled after Banks’s estate abruptly backed out. (Probably a wise decision, given both the challenge of adapting the material and the absurdity of one of the most exploitative corporations in the world attempting to adapt proudly far-left sci-fi.)</p>



<p>Apart from official projects, both men have made public references to Banks’s work as well—not much, but enough to know that they either really have read it, or that they were well-briefed by their PR teams.</p>



<p>“The Culture series is certainly, in terms of more modern science fiction, one of my absolute favorites,” Jeff Bezos <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2018/jeff-bezos-isdc-space-vision/"><strong>told GeekWire in 2018</strong></a>, when asked about his love for the series. ”We’re not quite at that level technologically, we’ve a lot of work to do before we get there, but there’s a utopian element to it that I find very attractive.”</p>



<p>*  *  *  *  *</p>



<p>There are ultimately two things that set the <em>Culture </em>series apart from many of its peers.</p>



<p>The first is the literary bent of the prose. Space opera (and genre fiction in general) has never <em>actually</em> looked like the “lasers and explosions” stereotype it was saddled with, but it’s worth emphasizing the depth of Banks’s characterization and strange depictions of an uncanny future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Characters grapple with trauma, identity, and crisis, and they do so without losing sight of the visceral and pulpy thrill of space opera’s inherent adventure and intrigue. Moments of quiet contemplation and deep metaphysical quandaries abound, coupled with strange literary pretensions that wouldn’t seem out of place in magical realism or literary fiction—a vast machine the size of a planet made of interlocking, nested globes, each holding a separate society; a grief-sick partner who holds their pregnancy in stasis for the better part of a century in a strange act of penance and passive-aggression; a vast extra-dimensional object that resists all attempts to analyze, communicate, or attack it, nearly sparking an interstellar war. The stories of the Culture simultaneously have a very real sense of strangeness and a deep, complex humanist bent, as if picking the best bit from multiple genres without losing the sense and feel of each constituent part.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p><span><strong>Since he first came onto the literary scene in the mid-Eighties, Banks was an avowed and rather public socialist.&nbsp;</strong></span></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Perhaps this savvy genre-bending should come as no surprise, considering Banks was an established author of literary fiction before he broke through as a sci-fi writer. While he had always dreamed of writing sci-fi (and indeed wrote at least one Culture novel before breaking through as a lit-fic author), it wasn’t until his break-out literary novel <em>The Wasp Factory</em> (1984) that he was able to start selling his sci-fi manuscripts, eventually settling into a rhythm where he danced more-or-less annually between mind-bending literary fiction published under the name Iain Banks and epic sci-fi novels published under the name “Iain <em>M.</em> Banks.” (His family, Banks explained, was offended he hadn’t used his middle name—Menzies—on <em>The Wasp Factory</em>.)</p>



<p>The other thing that sets both Banks and his <em>Culture </em>books apart is their overt and uncompromising politics.</p>



<p>Since he first came onto the literary scene in the mid-Eighties, Banks was an avowed and rather public socialist. He was a member of the Scottish Socialist Party and a frequent interviewee for magazines like <em>Socialist Worker</em>, as well as an outspoken opponent of the Iraq War who campaigned for the impeachment of Tony Blair and, when that failed, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/may/25/hayfestival2007.hayfestival"><strong>shredded his passport and mailed the remains to 10 Downing Street</strong>.</a> He spoke openly, and passionately, about labor exploitation, anti-imperialism, the environment, and a host of other now-popular issues, most of which still languished on the edge of the discourse when Banks first hit the scene.</p>



<p>He was also never shy about intermingling his politics and his work. Indeed, he saw them as being one and the same. Nowhere is this more clear than in a <a href="http://www.vavatch.co.uk/books/banks/cultnote.htm"><strong>1994 essay titled “A Few Notes on the Culture,”</strong></a> which Banks posted to the Usenet group rec.arts.sf.written. The sprawling document is both an overview of the Culture and an exegesis on Banks’s own worldview; between paragraphs delving into the society’s naming conventions, technology, and democratic apparatuses, Banks waxed poetic about the deleterious moral impact of capitalism and market forces:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>“The market, for all its (profoundly inelegant) complexities, remains a crude and essentially blind system, and is – without the sort of drastic amendments liable to cripple the economic efficacy which is its greatest claimed asset – intrinsically incapable of distinguishing between simple non-use of matter resulting from processal superfluity and the acute, prolonged and wide-spread suffering of conscious beings.</em></p><p><em>It is, arguably, in the elevation of this profoundly mechanistic (and in that sense perversely innocent) system to a position above all other moral, philosophical and political values and considerations that humankind displays most convincingly both its present intellectual [immaturity and] – through grossly pursued selfishness rather than the applied hatred of others – a kind of synthetic evil.”</em></p><cite>Iain M. Banks, “A Few Notes on the Culture”</cite></blockquote>



<p>These same politics have been front and center in Banks’s conception of the Culture, a group he affectionately described as “hippie commies with hyper-weapons and a deep distrust of both Marketolatry and Greedism.”</p></div></div>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>What are amulets? How are they situated in the larger narrative of European healing? Varied and complex objects, amulets present both challenges and opportunities for historians and museums alike. Yet an examination of these often-overlooked items within a medical context can provide significant information about cure and protection over different times and geographies. This article analyses ten amulets from the Science Museum collections, and asks what we can learn from exploring these objects’ material features and varying functions. It argues for a re-consideration of amulets from their categorisation by nineteenth- and twentieth-century collectors and classification by modern museums, to their recognition as a significant part of the history of healing.</p>

<h2>Introduction – a hare’s foot and a Billiken</h2>


<p>On his way home from running errands one morning in January 1665, Samuel Pepys stopped to buy a hare. Pepys was a Member of Parliament and administrator of the Navy, and is perhaps most famous for keeping a diary for almost a decade during his younger life. A few weeks earlier, despite ‘very cold weather’ he had celebrated a phase of good health, unsure whether to attribute it to his daily pill of turpentine, the fact that he had ‘left off the wearing of a gowne’, or simply his ‘hare’s foote’. Yet this good health did not last. The new year brought burning, pimples and pricks, bladder problems, headaches and ‘a great deal of pain’ to Pepys’ body (<a href="#reference-60">Pepys; Wheatley (ed), 1893</a>).<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> On this January morning, however, he had run into an acquaintance at Westminster Hall – Sir William Batten, Member of Parliament and surveyor to the Navy (<a href="#reference-59">Pepys, Latham (ed), 2003, p xlv</a>).<a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a> Batten had given Pepys medical advice regarding his latest ailment, a most painful bout of colic, for which he showed Pepys the mistake he had made with the hare’s foot and guaranteed the perfect modification to his remedy. Originally, the foot had not been cut properly, and ‘hath not the joynt to it’; this was where the problem lay.<a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a> Eager to try anything to alleviate his swollen belly and ‘grudgings of wind’, Pepys handled Batten’s correctly cut hare’s foot, and noted in wonder:</p>
<p>[Batten] assures me he never had his cholique since he carried it about him: and it is a strange thing how fancy works, for I no sooner almost handled his foote but my belly began to be loose and to break wind, and whereas I was in some pain yesterday and t’other day and in fear of more to-day, I became very well, and so continue.<a href="#footnote-4">[4]</a></p>
<p>The next day, having obtained a new animal and taken Batten’s advice, Pepys was finally convinced: ‘To my office till past 12, and then home to supper and to bed, being now mighty well, and truly I cannot but impute it to my fresh hare’s foote.’<a href="#footnote-5">[5]</a> One thing was clear; the hare’s foot had worked. Pepys was cured of colic.</p>

        <p>Amulet One – Hare’s foot, object number A666124</p>
        
    
    
</section>
<p>This object is not unfamiliar to us. This particular hare’s foot, which forms part of the Science Museum’s amulet collection, is originally from Norfolk and dated 1870–1920, but hares’ and rabbits’ feet can still be bought as ‘lucky charms’ and are widely available on the internet.<a href="#footnote-6">[6]</a>&nbsp; Populist literature similarly continues to reference the use of these items; <em>Scientific American</em> published an article on ‘What Makes a Rabbit’s Foot Lucky’ in 2011 (<a href="#reference-19">D’Costa, 2011</a>). Such objects remain a part of popular culture – that is, part of recognised cultural traditions – over three hundred years after being employed by Pepys. Yet we can observe a shift in function. In Pepys’ world, the various elements that constituted sickness and health were broad and wide-ranging. Illness, like health, could be affected by an extensive range of things from an imbalance of the bodily humours, environmental factors such as sleep, food, emotions and exercise, supernatural or preternatural forces, and even the stars.<a href="#footnote-7">[7]</a> Whilst Pepys sometimes consulted learned medical practitioners, the variety of people from whom he could seek counsel was extensive. In this case, he took the advice of his friend Sir William Batten.<a href="#footnote-8">[8]</a> Pepys’ story is part of a larger narrative of healing in which learned medicine, religion, astrology, magic, fate and fortune all played a role. As part of healing, objects could be invested with power from any one or more of these various sources, and employed to cure or protect. These objects have often been called amulets, both historically and today, although our interpretation of them has changed over time. The healing potency of amulets has not always been entirely understood, and their means of operation often hidden from comprehension. Yet within their own contexts, this functional complexity has not detracted from the items’ curative or protective effects. The narrative of healing that included amulets continued throughout the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and only when modern medicine necessitated ‘scientific’, empiric evidence of the mechanisms of objects’ efficacy did this change. In other words, amulets were relegated from the domain of authorised healing once it became a requirement to know and explain <em>how</em> cures worked, not just that they <em>did</em> work.</p>
<div><p>The word ‘amulet’ originates from the Latin ‘amulētum’, and was used by Pliny the Elder (23–79 CE) to denote an item worn on the body for therapeutic, apotropaic or exorcistic benefit (Skemer, 2006, pp 6–7). Whilst many have noted the belief that the word can be traced back to Arabic, the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) has refuted this (<a href="#reference-56">OED, 2018, ‘amulet’</a>). Whilst definitions vary, ‘charm’ is often used synonymously with ‘amulet’, whilst ‘talisman’ features less frequently. For instance, the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford has implied a semantic similarity between ‘amulets’ and ‘charms’, noting that an amulet is defined by the OED as: ‘Anything worn about the person as a charm preventative against evil, mischief, disease, witchcraft, etc.’, whilst a charm is described as ‘Anything worn about the person to avert evil or ensure prosperity’ – ‘though a charm may also be a spell or incantation believed to have a magical power’ (<a href="#reference-61">Pitt Rivers Museum, 2017</a>). ‘Amulets’ and ‘charms’ are also used synonymously by the Horniman Museum in London, and the Oxford English Dictionary’s definitions further allude to this; one entry noting that a charm is ‘Anything worn about the person to avert evil or ensure prosperity; an amulet’ (<a href="#reference-39">Horniman Museum, 2017</a>).<a href="#footnote-9">[9]</a></p><p>Evidently, amulets cannot be easily and simply defined, in part because the ways in which they have been used and understood have changed from antiquity to today. What, then, is the defining feature which makes an object an amulet? The answer to this is, its power. In the most basic and fundamental way, amulets are invested with the potency to heal. Healing centres around cure and protection, but where once these two actions were closely related, now they are more distinct. Historically, healing has not been monolithic and has taken many forms, relating to and deriving from faculties of fortune, fate, astrology, religion, magic, luck and more. Healing could therefore constitute anything from curing a specific disease, to averting a malevolent force, or fostering good fortune. This functional variation is valuable, as it can tell us a great deal about the practices and cultures in which objects are situated, as well as the objects themselves. For instance, around 250 years after Pepys cured his colic with our first amulet, the hare’s foot, an amusement park opened in Paris. As part of their brand <em>Luna Park</em> adopted a mascot known as a ‘Billiken’, a creature devised by an American artist who reportedly saw the mysterious figure in a dream and patented it in 1908. The Billiken, known as ‘God of Things as They Ought To Be’ was said to bring the customer luck, indicated by the inscription upon our second object, the park’s token: <em>Si tu me gardes je te porterai bonheur</em> (‘If you keep me I will bring you good luck/happiness’) / ‘I smile at you bad luck can’t harm you’.<a href="#footnote-10">[10]</a> This amulet offered protection and generated auspicious effects to the person who possessed it. Evidently, it had been considered important enough to be kept. Thus whilst culturally, temporally and materially distinct, the hare’s foot and the Luna Park Billiken are nevertheless united by their curative and protective potency, and demonstrate the wide spectrum of healing.</p></div>

</section>
<div><p>Yet where once healing and amulets went hand in hand, modern discussions tend to treat them as distinct. Labelling certain objects as ‘amulets’ questions their power to work, and when these items and their potency are challenged, they are ‘othered’, relegated and disassociated from the realms of healing. The hare’s foot provides an example of this. Whether situated in museum collections or referred to in common parlance, this amulet is not commonly recognised today as a curative object, nor regarded as an effective remedy for the colic. Instead, the feet of rabbits and hares are now bought, used and regarded often merely as ‘lucky’ items. This hare’s foot from the Science Museum’s collections is recorded as an amulet employed ‘for protection against cramp’.<a href="#footnote-11">[11]</a> To label something as prophylactic, an item ‘against’ a particular affliction exemplifies …</p></div></div></section></article></div>

<p>I like poker, but I’m better at chess.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png" alt="Poker vs chess" width="499" height="451" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-347x314.png 347w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-694x628.png 694w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-768x695.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-1536x1389.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px"></a></p>
<p>Poker can be a lot of fun if you have a witty enough group of friends and a generous snack budget. There’s nothing worse than playing poker with a bunch of serious gamblers who think conversation and choice of hot wing spiciness are potential tells.</p>
<p>I like chess because nothing is hidden. I don’t like leaving things to chance, and I’m often foolish enough to believe I can figure out how to win if I have all the information.</p>
<p>In chess, there are no missing pieces. There isn’t a sneaky queen that your opponent can place on the board when you least expect it. Everything is in the open. The strategy and tactics are entirely determined by what is sitting in front of you in plain sight.</p>
<p>If I try to play poker the way I play chess, I’m going to lose. I can’t see all the cards. Information is hidden from me, and it’s information I need to make the right decisions.</p>
<p>If you can’t stand the uncertainty of poker, don’t do a startup. Don’t do an innovation project.</p>
<p>Innovation is like poker.</p>

<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11.png" alt="A group of people playing poker" width="599" height="441" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-427x314.png 427w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-853x628.png 853w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-768x565.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-1536x1130.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>

<h2>The Rules of Startup Poker</h2>
<p>This is not an ordinary game of poker. (So don’t worry if you’re not a poker player, this will still make sense.) I will stretch the analogy of Texas Hold ‘Em as far as I can in this special variation of Startup Poker.</p>
<p>Each player needs to pay the ante to play. This is a cheap game, so we’ll keep the ante at $1. Those are the costs of running an innovation project.</p>
<p>Each player gets dealt two cards that they can keep hidden. These cards represent the organization’s unique capabilities and business model — what they already have when they start.</p>

<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png" alt="A group of people playing poker part 2" width="599" height="450" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-418x314.png 418w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-836x628.png 836w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-768x577.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-1536x1154.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>As a normal Texas Hold ‘Em game progresses, the dealer will turn over additional cards in the middle of the table, which each player can use as part of their hand. First there are the three cards called “the Flop,” which are turned over at the same time. Then a fourth card is turned, which is called “Fourth Street” or “The Turn.” The last card is “the River.” Players can place bets before each of these rounds, trying to raise the stakes and force other players to fold.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1.png" alt="Texas Hold ‘Em startup poker" width="484" height="817" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1.png 1184w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1-186x314.png 186w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1-372x628.png 372w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1-768x1297.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1-910x1536.png 910w" sizes="(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px"></a></p>
<p>In Startup Poker, all these shared cards represent the Market. The first three cards are “the Early Adopters.” The fourth card is “the Early Majority” and the last is “the Late Majority.” As the game goes on, the Market matures and players discover if they hold the winning hand.</p>
<p>The winner of the game is the person who has the best fit between the cards in their hand (which represents their business model) and the cards on the table (the Market). We can think of this as Product / Market fit or Business Model / Market fit.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1.png" alt="Market vs business model" width="599" height="472" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1-399x314.png 399w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1-797x628.png 797w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1-768x605.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1-1536x1210.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>The basic setup is the same, but remember, we are not playing regular Texas Hold ‘Em. Our rules are a bit different.</p>
<h2>Information Costs Money</h2>
<p>In Startup Poker, players have to ante another $1 every round to stay in. This is the cost of product development. (For our purposes, we are eliminating the standard Hold’em practice of “blinds,” which is a form of uneven antes.).</p>
<p>Additionally, instead of every round beginning by flipping over Market cards, players can get a preview by paying an additional $1 for each card. (In real poker, everyone sees the flipped card, but in our version you’re paying for a sneak peek.)</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png" alt="A poker player peeking at a flipped card" width="699" height="514" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-427x314.png 427w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-853x628.png 853w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-768x565.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-1536x1130.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px"></a></p>
<p>This is the equivalent of funding an <a href="https://kromatic.com/workshops/building-and-resourcing-teams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="innovation team" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked">innovation team</a> to gather Market information. This investment isn’t really just money, it’s blood, sweat, and tears. But since people * time = money, we’ll just use our poker chips to represent this investment. The team is really going out into the real world, talking to customers, putting up a landing page, or running some other form of experiment or research to gather information.</p>
<p>At that point, they have the option to kill the idea (fold) or persevere before a round of betting.</p>
<p>Should we go straight ahead and bet on our hand? Or should we buy a peek at the Market first?</p>
<h2>Bet It All in Waterfall</h2>
<p>We could just close our eyes and bet it all on our pair of jacks. This is the equivalent of <a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/lean-startup-in-the-enterprise-anti-pattern-the-lean-waterfall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">waterfall development</a>, where we place our bets and literally let the cards fall where they may.</p>
<p>We believe our cards are the correct ones for the Market, despite having not seen a single card from that Market. So we are placing a lot of faith in our business model and capabilities — our pair of jacks — and to be fair, that is a formidable hand.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png" alt="A player risking it all to bet in a poker game" width="599" height="405" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-465x314.png 465w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-929x628.png 929w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-768x519.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-1536x1038.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>But we’ve invested for the long hall, so we push it all in and check the snack bar while the hand plays out. But the Market isn’t kind. Our opponent starts with a 2 and a 4, but winds up closing a 2-6 straight with the 3, 5 and 6 from the Market. We lose to a weaker starting hand that ended up being better for that Market. We end up sitting in the corner binging on Pringles and lukewarm beer for the rest of the night while everyone else keeps playing, but that’s a risk of Waterfall.</p>
<h2>Information Has Value</h2>
<p>So instead of going all-in based on our business model and capabilities, should we buy that peek at the Market if we’re holding a pair of jacks?</p>
<p>The answer here is yes. Obviously so.</p>
<p>If everyone is sneaking a peek at the next card except you, you are at a huge disadvantage. Now they are playing chess because they can see more of the board. Meanwhile, you think you are still playing poker.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png" alt="A player playing chess blindfolded" width="512" height="565" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png 1812w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-285x314.png 285w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-569x628.png 569w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-768x847.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-1392x1536.png 1392w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></a></p>
<p>True, they still can’t see their opponents’ hole cards, so they don’t have all the information, but they have more than you.</p>
<p>So should you pay for the peek no matter what you are holding in your hand? Well, that depends on the cost.</p>
<h2>Don’t Play Every Hand</h2>
<p>If you start the game with a 2 of spades and a 9 of hearts, you have a bad hand. It’s not worth getting Market information because you are woefully unprepared for any Market. You might get lucky and find three twos on the board, but that’s a longshot. The odds are that someone else has a better hand. Just fold and play the next hand.</p>

<p>For large organizations, this is the equivalent of having an idea that is fundamentally mismatched with the company.</p>
<p>“Let’s make vegan hamburgers,” says the mining company.</p>
<p>This makes no sense. It is the 2/9 offsuit of business ideas. Let’s skip this idea and work on something with a little more promise.</p>
<h2>Pivoting</h2>
<p>In the real world, startups aren’t stuck with the cards that they are dealt. If something isn’t working with their business model, they can pivot.</p>
<p>You can also alter your product in Startup Poker, because after you peek at the cards on the board, we let you trade the cards in your hand — for a price. Each round, each player has the opportunity to trade in one card at a cost of $1. It’s an option to change your product / business model after you’ve gotten a taste of the market.</p>
<p>So let’s say you start with a pair of twos — one heart and one spade. You pay $3 to peek at three cards. They are the three, four, and five of hearts.</p>
<p>You might want to trade in your two of spades and get a new card from the deck, giving yourself a shot at a flush, a straight, or a straight flush.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png" alt="Early adopters vs business model" width="599" height="585" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-321x314.png 321w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-643x628.png 643w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-768x750.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-1536x1501.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>You are exercising an option to find a better fit with the Market. It’s only the information that you’ve gained by buying a peek at the Market that makes this pivot worthwhile.</p>
<h2>Arrogance</h2>
<p>Let’s face it, arrogance never helps in chess or in poker. Everytime I get cocky in chess, I lose.</p>
<p>Chess rankings are highly visible when playing. So when I relax for my lunchtime game and see that I’m playing someone with a rating 200 points below me, I know I’m going to win. Which is of course exactly when I’m going to lose.</p>
<p>I’m so confident in winning that I start checking my Slack messages while playing. Then I draft an email. Then I make some tea. I get distracted, forget my plan, and generally make a stupid mistake.</p>
<p>“Bad luck!” But there is no luck in chess — this is the folly of arrogance.</p>
<p>If we really wanted to make Startup Poker realistic, every player would be forced to drink 5 shots of bourbon before playing, then when they look at the two cards in their hand they’ll be convinced they have three of a kind. Every entrepreneur thinks they are the second coming of Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>Confidence is great. Good entrepreneurs don’t go into a market without some level of confidence. But arrogance allows your confidence to overrule your judgement.</p>
<h2>The Size of the Pot</h2>
<p>There’s another oddity to Startup Poker in that no one knows exactly how big the pot is. It is somewhat determined by the antes that people are paying in and the bets being made, but mostly it’s determined by the Market.</p>
<p>Of course, people can bet up the pot and force players to invest more to keep up. It’s the same as startups competing against each other. When one buys advertising, the others better match it or have a better strategy.</p>
<p>To calculate the value of the Market, we add up the value of the cards to determine the size of the pot (numbered cards are worth their face value, royal cards are worth $10, and aces are worth $15). So this makes buying Market information even more important.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png" alt="The size of the pot" width="699" height="356" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-600x306.png 600w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-1200x612.png 1200w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-768x391.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-1536x783.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px"></a></p>
<p>Don’t waste your money and time playing for a small pot.</p>
<h2>Crowded Markets</h2>
<p>Lastly, look at who is competing. It can be very compelling to play in a game with fewer people. Remember, the size of the prize is mostly determined by the Market, not the amount of competition. Unfortunately, in Startup Poker, players can join the game at any time.</p>
<p>When the dealer starts turning over Market cards, players who have not anteed up to that point can opt in. Of course at first they are at a disadvantage. They have missed at least one opportunity to get advanced information, and they’ve lost at least one opportunity to pivot. But they can still get into the Market — a Market that you’ve already invested in.</p>
<p>So if the first two cards the Market shows are a King and Jack, that’s $20 already in the pot. That might attract some latecomers to the game, and the competition might increase quickly.</p>

<p>Players who find themselves alone in a game at the early stages should still take advantage of the opportunity to get more information early, and to pivot if necessary. Even if …</p></div></div>

<p>A realistic look at Python web frameworks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you take a look around the blogosphere at various benchmarks for Python web frameworks, you might start to feel pretty bad about your own setup. Or, alternatively, super-hyped about the possibilities.</p><p>Consider, for instance, the incredible work of the guys at <a href="https://magic.io/blog/uvloop-blazing-fast-python-networking/">magic stack</a>, getting <strong>100,000 requests per second</strong> from <a href="https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop">uvloop</a> in a single thread. This is on par with compiled language like Go's performance.</p><p>But that benchmark doesn't really cover a fully fleshed out web framework, right? We need a lot more functionality and structure from our frameworks than reading and writing bytes. What about fully fleshed-out web-frameworks in python?</p><p>One such framework is <a href="https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic">Sanic</a>, which again has been shown to have similar performance: <strong>100,000</strong> requests per-second. Or there's <a href="https://vibora.io/">Vibora</a>. Not only does this claim to be a drop-in replacement for <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a>, but it also has its own templating engine. And it handles <strong>350,000 requests per second</strong>!</p><p>Even more mind-blowing is <a href="https://github.com/squeaky-pl/japronto">Japronto</a> which claims an insane <strong>1.2 million requests per-second</strong> in a single thread 🤯 trouncing the performance of other languages and frameworks:</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/squeaky-pl/japronto/master/benchmarks/results.png" alt="https://github.com/squeaky-pl/japronto"></p><p>Recently we've been doing a lot of work improving the performance of our Python APIs. Currently we're running <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a>, and we initially had a single question: <em>how can we serve more requests from a single worker thread? </em>But looking at these benchmarks had us asking more:</p><ol><li>Can we meaningfully compare them to our setup?</li><li>How realistic are they for a full production application?</li><li>Would we be better using one of these frameworks over Flask?</li></ol><p>In other words, how much should we trust these benchmarks? And to what extent should they influence our choice of technology?</p><p>In order to answer these questions, in this post, I benchmark a realistic Flask application along with it's <a href="https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic">Sanic</a> equivalent. I'm going to guess that most readers come from a background with one of the more "traditional" Python frameworks (<a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a> or <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>), and it's certainly more relevant to devs here at Suade Labs. For this reason, I run the Flask app in a number of different ways, to see what the best bang for our buck is: how performant can we make our application with (almost) zero changes to the code? Along the way we'll pick up some tips for the original question: <em>how can we serve more requests from a single worker thread?</em></p><p><strong>Sidenote: </strong>if you're new to Python's web frameworks, or its asynchronous libraries, take a look at [1] from the addenda at the bottom of this post for a quick explainer. This post mostly assumes you know these things.</p><h2 id="the-baseline">The baseline</h2><p>First let's run some simple "Hello, World!" benchmarks on our system to get a meaningful baseline for comparison. For reference, the Flask benchmarks on <a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r18&amp;hw=ph&amp;test=fortune&amp;l=zijzen-f">techempower</a> give 25,000 requests per second.</p><p>Here's our Flask app:</p><pre><code>app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def hello():
    if request.method == "GET":
        return "Hello, World!"

    data = request.get_json(force=True)
    try:
        return "Hello, {id}".format(**data)
    except KeyError:
        return "Missing required parameter 'id'", 400</code></pre><p>I ran it under a variety of conditions. First "raw" via <code>python app.py</code>, and then under <a href="https://gunicorn.org/">Gunicorn</a> with a single <code>sync</code> worker via <code>gunicorn -k sync app:app</code> and finally Gunicorn with a single <a href="https://github.com/gevent/gevent">gevent</a> worker via <code>gunicorn -k gevent app:app</code>. In theory Gunicorn should handle concurrency and dropped connections much better than the raw python, and using the gevent worker should allow us to do asynchronous IO without changing our code [2a]. We also ran these benchmarks under <a href="https://www.pypy.org/">PyPy</a>, which in theory should speed up any CPU-bound code without making any changes (if you haven't heard of PyPy see [2b] in the addenda below for a quick explanation and some terminology).</p><p>And what about Sanic? Well, here's the "rewrite" of our app:</p><pre><code>app = Sanic(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
async def hello(request):
    if request.method == "GET":
        return text("Hello, World!")

    data = request.json
    try:
        return text("Hello, {id}".format(**data))
    except KeyError:
        raise InvalidUsage("Missing required parameter 'id'")</code></pre><p>And here are the results:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/hello_world-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 1000w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 1161w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><div><p>Some technical details: I used Python 3.7 with the regular CPython interpreter and Python 3.6 with PyPy 7.3.3. At the time of writing, running 3.6 is the latest PyPy interpreter, and their Python 2.7 interpreter is faster in some edge cases, but as Python 2 is <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/">officially dead</a>, I don't believe it productive to benchmark. My system details are available in the addenda [3]. I used <a href="https://github.com/wg/wrk">wrk</a> to actually execute the benchmarks.</p><p>I'll break the results down in two parts. First: Sanic dominates, with 23,000 requests a second, although running our Flask app under Guncorn + gevent and PyPy does a pretty good job at keeping up. Second: what's going on with the performance range for our Flask app?</p></div><p>Under CPython, we see that using Gunicorn quadruples the number of Flask requests per second from 1,000 to 4,000 and using a gevent worker adds a mild (sub 10%) speed boost to this. The PyPy results are more impressive. In the raw test, it is churning through 3,000 requests a second; it received the same 4x speed boost from Gunicorn, getting us to 12,000 requests a second; finally with the addition of gevent, it cranks up to 17,000 requests a second, 17x more than the raw CPython version without changing a single line of code.</p><p>I was quite struck by the fact that gevent had such little effect on the CPython process - probably this is because the CPU is maxed out at this point. On the other hand, it seems that PyPy's better speed means it is still spending time waiting on system calls / IO, even under Gunicorn. Adding gevent to the mix means that it switches between concurrent connections, processing them as fast as the CPU will let it.</p><p>To get a real sense of this, I ran the benchmark whilst monitoring CPU usage. Here's a short test against the raw app under PyPy:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png 919w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>You can see that the program hops between CPU cores and rarely utilises 100% of a given core. On the other hand, here's part of a much longer test against the Gunicorn gevent worker under PyPy:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png 900w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Now it's evident that there is no switching between CPU cores (the process has become "sticky") and the individual core is being utilised to a far higher degree.</p><p><strong>Key takeaways</strong>: Sanic wins. PyPy is fast. Run your "traditional" app under Gunicorn.</p><h2 id="realistic-benchmarks">Realistic benchmarks</h2><div><p>The benchmark above, while fun, is pretty meaningless for real-world applications. Let's add some more functionality to our app!</p><p>First, we'll allow users to actually store data in a database, which we'll retrieve via an ORM (in our case <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a>, the de-facto stand-alone ORM in python). Second, we'll add input-validation to make sure our users get meaningful error messages, and that we're not accepting junk that crashes our app. Finally we'll add a response marshaller to automate the process of converting our database object to JSON.</p></div><p>We'll write a simple book store app, for a publishing house. We have a number of authors each writing zero or more books in several genres. For simplicity, each book has only a single author, but can have multiple genres - for example we could have a book which is in both the "Existential Fiction" and "Beatnik Poetry" categories. We're going to add 1 million authors to our database and roughly 10 million books. [4]</p><p>Our SQLAlchemy models look a little like this:</p>
<pre><code>class Author(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(UUIDType, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)
    ... # snip!

class Book(db.Model):
    author_id = db.Column(
        UUIDType, db.ForeignKey("author.id"), nullable=False, index=True
    )
    author = db.relationship("Author", backref="books")
    ... # snip!
</code></pre>
<p>To marshal these, we use <a href="https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Marshmallow</a>, which is a popular Python marshalling library. Here's an example of the Marshmallow model for the Author overview:</p>
<pre><code>class Author(Schema):
    id = fields.Str(dump_only=True)
    name = fields.Str(required=True)
    country_code = EnumField(CountryCodes, required=True)
    email = fields.Str(required=True)
    phone = fields.Str(required=True)
    contact_address = fields.Str(required=True)
    contract_started = fields.DateTime(format="iso")
    contract_finished = fields.DateTime(format="iso")
    contract_value = fields.Integer()
</code></pre>
<p>In our endpoints these are used for validating input and returning results like so:</p>
<pre><code>@bp.route("/author", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def author():
    """View all authors, or create a new one."""

    if request.method == "GET":
        args = validate_get(marshallers.LimitOffsetSchema())
        limit = args["limit"]
        offset = args["offset"]

        authors = Author.query.limit(limit).offset(offset).all()
        return jsonify(marshallers.authors.dump(authors))

    if request.method == "POST":
        author = Author(**validate_post(marshallers.author))

        db.session.add(author)
        db.session.commit()

        return jsonify({"id": author.id})
</code></pre>
<p>The full source code can be viewed in the <a href="https://github.com/olliemath/async_python">GitHub repo</a>. Here, the thing to note is that <code>marshallers.foo</code> is an instance of a <a href="https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Marshmallow</a> schema, which can be used both to validate a Foo input, for instance in a POST request, as well as to marshal Foo instances ready for returning as JSON.</p>
<p>In order to actually perform asynchronous database requests, some fancy footwork is required with patching libraries, which depends on which postgres connector you use. SQLAlchemy does not support this out of the box, and in fact its primary developer has a great post arguing that <a href="https://techspot.zzzeek.org/2015/02/15/asynchronous-python-and-databases/">an async ORM is not always a great idea</a>. Juicy technical details in addenda [5], but beware that just using a Gunicorn gevent worker will not necessarily get you what you want.</p><p>PyPy tends to suffer a performance hit when using C-extensions and libraries instead of pure python, conversely CPython should get a performance boost from the C-based libs. To take account of this I tested two different underlying database connectors: both <a href="https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2">psycopg2</a> and a …</p></div></section></article></div></div>
