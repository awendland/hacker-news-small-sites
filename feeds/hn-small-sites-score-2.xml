<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>The first commercial version of <a href="https://curious-expedition.com/">Curious Expedition</a> was released at the end of 2014. In this blog post I will give you the complete overview of all the sales numbers of these first six years. How many units we sold, when we sold them, in which territories, on which platforms. I will also tell how it felt to tank with our game and how we were able to eventually turn it into a bigger success than we ever imagined.</p>
<p>In case you never heard about it: Curious Expedition is a roguelike expedition game in which you explore uncharted lands, fight dangerous beasts and encounter unknown tribes, all while trying to not go insane or getting forsaken by your own trek members. It is the first game by  <a href="http://maschinen-mensch.com/" target="_blank">Maschinen-Mensch</a>.</p>

<p>Over time, it was released on all major store fronts: Steam, GOG, HumbleStore and itch.io. We recently released console versions for Xbox, PS and Nintendo Switch, but that happened after the initial five years and will not be covered here.</p>

<h3 id="the-big-picture">The big picture</h3>
<p>I’ll give you the grand yearly numbers right away. For NDA reasons I can’t go into specific details about how much we sold on each distribution platform, but will instead lump all our digital sales together. All of this units are gross value, that means before tax, distribution rev share and charge backs (usually around 5-15%).</p>


<p>As you can see Curious Expedition had its <strong>most successful years two full years after releasing the first version</strong>. If you’re interested in how we managed to do that just keep reading the detailed history below:</p>
<h2 id="year-1-2014---alpha">Year 1 (2014) - Alpha</h2>
<h3 id="beginnings">Beginnings</h3>
<p>Johannes and I met at Berlin AAA developer <a href="https://www.yager.de/" target="_blank">Yager</a> where we both worked on the war/anti-war game Spec Ops: The Line. We decided to start working on a hobby project around 2012, with the grand dream of potentially going indie with it. Curious Expedition (or Terra Incognita as it was called back then) was the first game that we both agreed on. The idea came to me when I browsed a National Geographic magazine in the waiting room of my dentist.</p>
<p>During this hobbyist phase we struggled quite a bit with the game. Our interest in the premise never waned, but we went through dozens of game mechanics without really being able to nail down the core loop concept. During that time we met multiple times with the intention of quitting the game, only to give it two more months over and over again. We made a leap of faith when we decided to quit our AAA jobs in the beginning of 2014.</p>
<p>The birth of our company Maschinen-Mensch (at some point we had called ourselves Hic Sunt Leones) was eased by a <strong>€50,000 grant from <a href="https://www.medienboard.de/" target="_blank">Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg</a></strong>. Thankfully we also had a bit of personal savings that helped us survive the initial months since the grant is only allowed to cover 50% of the project costs.</p>
<p>The first thing we did when finally started working full-time on the game, was completely ripping it apart and disabling all features until nothing but a simplistic movement prototype remained. From here we rebuilt all the aspects of the game. Our hope that we finally were onto something was kindled by the positive feedback from our small game designer meetup that we started around the same time.</p>
<p>At the end of 2014 we pushed ourselves to finally release the painfully barebone initial alpha of the game. Complete sections of the game were still missing: when you ran into combat a text message would tell you that we basically didn’t get to that part yet. But we had no choice: our money was running out at this point.</p>
<h3 id="alpha-editions">Alpha Editions</h3>
<p>We released the first buyable version of Curious Expedition on our own homepage where we sold it via the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/developer/widget" target="_blank">Humble Widget</a>. We took some inspiration from all the new Kickstarter projects that were created in 2014 and showed that players appreciated different pricing and feature options for purchasing games.</p>
<p>Here’s an overview of all editions we started with:</p>

<h3 id="day-1-sales">Day 1 sales</h3>
<p>Our first release date was November 18th 2014 and we sold in total <em>drum rolls</em>.. <strong>61 copies for a total revenue of $1,203</strong>. Not exactly dream numbers when you just quit your high profile AAA job and spent all your savings on creating this indie game, which has to work out for you to be able to remain an indie game dev.</p>
<p>Here’s a break-down of the unit types sold on that first day:</p>
<div><h4>Launch Day (November 18th 2014)</h4></div>
<h3 id="back-to-work">Back to work</h3>
<p>After pushing the big frightening release button, I remember that we went to a coincidental drink out with some friends from the game dev scene. I still remember how they asked curiously how much we had already sold. I felt bad about telling them that this great indie game experiment we had launched had pretty much tanked at this point. But there was no point in giving up now, so on Monday we got back into the office (which was my living room) and just started working on our next big alpha update.</p>
<p>I turned my old iPad into a live sales metrics board showing the current sales in the style of an airport destinations board and we hooked up to a hefty cash register sound whenever somebody bought a copy of our game. I remember with joy the small moments of celebration when during work the sound would come up and how we high-fived. I also remember those stretches of hours when there was no single sound being played though and we were checking if our metrics were broken, before realizing once again that this was just the state of affairs.</p>
<p>In 2014 we sold in total <strong>793</strong> units for a revenue of <strong>$10,965</strong> with an average price point of <strong>$13.83</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="year-2-2015---early-access">Year 2 (2015) - Early Access</h2>
<p>In 2015 we pushed hard on extending Curious Expedition 1. Despite the slow start we were nowhere done and set our hopes into appearing in digital storefronts. So far we had tried to bring people to our small website, but since the players didn’t come to the game, it was time to bring the game to the players.</p>
<h3 id="alpha-videos">Alpha Videos</h3>
<p>Up to this point we had mostly relied on twitter to attract players to our homepage. Today we’re close to 6,000 followers on twitter, but back then we were struggling for a long time to even get to 500 followers.</p>
<p>To build up visibility and hopefully share our excitement about our game, we started recording videos for the numerous alpha updates that we did. Looking at them now, they are a crazy trip down the memory lane to our past selves. Here’s the one for Alpha 4, which is special since it is the alpha in which we added combat for the first time.</p>

          <p>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m0KRUAeg79E" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
          </p>
          
<p>For each alpha update we announced the release day weeks in advance and approached it like a mini-release with marketing material and a strong theme for each of these updates. We made sure to have at least one highly visible “hero feature” per alpha release.</p>
<p>For this update our main focus were our dice challenges. We had been working on combat prototypes for over a year at this point, but as we added more and more combat features, we realized that it became a big centerpiece and we were over-scoping heavily, so we made the hard decision to completely remove combat and make a game that would work solely based on the merits of its unique travel gameplay first.</p>
<p>We did this even though we felt that we had stumbled into an interesting spin on combat: a 1-dimensional dungeon crawler, where instead of on a grid your character and the enemies would be laid out on a line.</p>
<h3 id="free-weekend">Free weekend!</h3>
<p>Before going to stores, we decided to try our luck on drawing more people to our website one last time and did a free weekend! Players could play the game right from their web browser without having to download anything. This was not only nice for lowering entry barriers but also made it very easy for us to revoke access to the game after the weekend was done.</p>
<p>We expected to have fewer sales during the free weekend with an uptick in sales afterwards from players who wanted to play more. To our surprise we had the highest sales during the time when the game was free. Afterwards the sales normalized pretty quickly again.</p>
<div><h4>Sales before and after the free weekend (Feb 2015)</h4></div>
<h3 id="storefront">Storefront!</h3>
<p>On May 19th we finally entered Early Access on Steam as our first store front and this is when Curious Expedition finally changed trajectory to become a success. We still sold the extra editions through our own homepage but the vast majority of sales now happened on the digital storefronts.</p>
<h3 id="pricing-strategy">Pricing Strategy</h3>
<p>We increased our price from <strong>$12</strong> to <strong>$15</strong> as we released the Early Access version. We felt it was fair enough since we had spent many months adding additional content to the game. The following chart shows the average price point per year.</p>
<div><h4>Average Price per Year (2015-2019)</h4></div>
<p>We also decided to be as timid as possible regarding sales. Until we reached the 1.0 phase we decided to not do any sales that went beyond 20%. You can see a timeline of our general sale price reductions here.</p>
<div><h4>On-Sale Reduction (2015-2019)</h4></div>
<p>In 2015 we sold in total <strong>21,266</strong> units for a revenue of <strong>$302,534</strong> with an average price point of <strong>$14.23</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="year-3-2016---gold-release">Year 3 (2016) - Gold Release</h2>
<h3 id="going-gold">Going Gold</h3>
<p>This is the year that we released the 1.0 version of Curious Expedition after over a year of Early Access. We also landed in more online stores: getting a presence in the HumbleStore and being lucky enough to be chosen by GOG as one of the very few games that they chose for their Games in Production program.</p>
<p>We read that you only get one big push in your game’s lifetime: either your Kickstarter campaign or your early access release or your full release. Luckily for us this turned out to not be the case. Not only did the game keep selling well in 2016, the release of the 1.0 version even surpassed our sales records until that point and pushed the game to sell more units than it had in 2015. After the gold release we started applying more sales and going beyond 20%. We were still extremely conservative for a game that had been released for two years now.</p>
<h3 id="art-games">Art Games</h3>
<p>This year we also started working with the Goethe Institute, a non-profit German cultural …</p></div></div></div>

            <h3>Myth 1. It’s easier to verify in-house software development productivity</h3>
    </p>
                                
                                
                                
                                
                                
                                
                                
                                

                            
                                
                                
                                
                                    
<div>
                <div>
                <p>At one time, it certainly was easier to keep tabs on in-house team productivity. That’s no longer the case with today’s team collaboration software. Automated software development analytics programs like <a href="https://gitential.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gitential</a> and<a href="https://waydev.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Waydev</a> put remote developers on equal footing with in-house software development teams. They track all interactions with git repositories and produce a variety of performance metrics. This brings complete transparency to team member productivity.&nbsp; A shortlist of metrics includes code churn, code efficiency, code volume, coding hours, number of commits, and test volume.</p>
<p>Do you need actual “eyes-on” what everyone is doing?<a href="https://www.sococo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Sococo</a> provides a virtual office solution for Agile Teams. Whether in-house or distributed, all team members have a room in your “virtual building.” At a glance, you can see who’s online and what they’re working on, in real-time. It provides broadcasting capabilities, teleconferences, screen-sharing for presentations, and more. The only downside is that it requires everyone to use a headset.</p>

                <p>We can break this myth. Some offices are idealistic and serene. Some home offices may resemble mosh pits. A<a href="https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/flexjobs-2018-annual-survey-workers-believe-flexible-remote-job-can-help-save-money-reduce-stress-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 2018 FlexJobs Survey</a> of 3,000 participants indicated 75% are more productive working remotely. They cited coworker interruptions and general office noises as major issues. Less commuting and reduced office politics were also cited as boosting productivity. The<a href="https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/remote-work-statistics/#gref" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Ultimate List of Remote Work Statistics</a> – 2020 Edition shows similar studies from Owl Labs, Buffer, Gallup, and others. They consistently reflect higher productivity and quality of work in telecommuting environments.</p>
<p>Veteran remote developers know two things are vital. The first is to remove distractions from one’s work area. The second is the discipline to not give in to temptations. Managers can coach team members they believe are challenged by their work remote environment. In-house teams may find the adjustment difficult at first. For outsourced teams, <i>it is their SOP</i> and they likely have productivity tips to share.</p>

                <p>Some managers believe that you lose control of your project without an in-house team. That can happen if you forget two important legal agreements. The first is a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).&nbsp; It enforces that team members understand you own and control all intellectual property. That goes for any work product or inventions associated with any contract.</p>
<p>The second is a Service Level Agreement (SLA). This specifies the services an agency or individual will provide to you. It specifies the expected standards and metrics whereby the work will be measured. It lays out each party’s responsibilities. Additionally, it defines the remedies and penalties for any breach. Violations of SLA’s and NDA’s are subject to civil suits and monetary damages.</p>
<p>In all cases, as the contractor, you are free to specify who your project manager will be. You decide what methodologies and processes your teams will follow. You select the team collaboration software, and reporting mechanisms everyone will use.</p>

                <p>Recruiter and hiring managers aren’t complaining about a lack of job applications. Their gripes concern a lack of qualified applicants. In 2019, the United States had about 4.2 million software developers. In contrast, there are roughly 5.5 million developers in Europe and 24 million worldwide. In-house software development teams rely upon limited local talent. You can attract more qualified developers by outsourcing through IT staffing agencies.</p>
<p>While the United States does have good programmers, they don’t stack up against the Top 10 very well. According to<a href="https://skillvalue.com/companies/en/it-ranking-best-developers-2019-skillvalue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Where to Find the Best Developers in 2019?</a> by SkillValue, the United States ranks a distant #27. US developers had scored 84.59% as rated against over 550 technical assessments.</p>
<p>In comparison, a wide swath of Eastern Europe scored in the 93% range. Ukraine, for example, ranked #5 with a score of 93.17%. But don’t forget to factor in Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) and Cost of Living. Add these and you’ll find that Ukraine’s ~250,000 developers offer the best combination of value and technical proficiency available.</p>

<p><strong>KLM is in the throes of a crisis of unprecedented magnitude. Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus at the start of 2020, numerous measures have already been taken to deal with the current circumstances. Expectations are that the road to recovery will be long and fraught with uncertainty. This means that KLM’s structure and size must be rigorously adjusted even further in the years ahead. Consequently, a total of 4,500 to 5,000 positions in the entire KLM Group (expressed in FTEs) will cease to exist.</strong></p>



<p>In the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, KLM gradually began reducing the size of its network in February to operate less than 10% of its original number of <a href="https://kokpitherald.com/united-airlines-plans-to-resume-service-on-more-than-25-international-routes-in-september/">flights</a> by the start of April. In the second quarter, only 15% of the original number of flights were operated. In July, 30% of the original flights were operated and load factors are lagging behind. As a result, while the network is again being gradually and carefully expanded, revenues are lagging far behind.</p>

<p>Prospects for the airline industry – and KLM in particular – are uncertain. Different countries are now beginning to tighten their more relaxed travel restrictions. This is making customers more cautious when it comes to booking a ticket. In all scenarios, demand is only expected to recover by 2023 or 2024 at the earliest. The degree and speed of recovery will depend on a number of factors including the development of the virus, economic recovery and customer travel behaviour.</p>



<h2>KLM Adjusting to the New Reality</h2>



<p>Government support in the form of a direct state loan and guaranteed bank credit facilities amounting to a maximum of €3.4 billion will enable KLM to navigate the crisis in the forthcoming period. <a href="https://news.klm.com/klm-adapts-organisation-further-due-to-covid-19-crisis/" target="_blank" aria-label="KLM (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">KLM</a> is extremely grateful for this support provided by means of the loan. In order to guarantee KLM’s existence in the longer term, the airline must adapt its size to the new reality. KLM therefore finds itself compelled to reduce its workforce down to the number needed for the planned operation in 2021/2022. Of the current total of 33,000 FTEs in the entire KLM Group, the workforce must be reduced by 4,500 to 5,000 FTEs to 28,000 FTEs in the course of 2021.</p>



<p>KLM’s size is already becoming smaller – and will continue to be reduced – based on the current measures, which include the non-renewal of temporary contracts (1,500 FTEs) and the Voluntarily Departure Scheme (2,000 FTEs). Additionally, natural attrition (500 FTEs) through retirement and the like in 2020 and 2021 will also contribute to the reduction needed.</p>



<p>Hence, despite the measures already taken, even fewer people will be needed at KLM in the years ahead. Additionally, for positions on the ground we also need to deal with some mismatch in functional skills and capabilities.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, for this reason and taking into account the mismatch, alternative solutions will have to be found for ca. 1,500 positions. This relates to up to 500 ground positions, 300 cabin crew positions and 300 cockpit positions and approximately 400 positions at KLM subsidiaries and Air France-KLM group functions.</p>



<p>Given the high level of uncertainty, KLM keeps open the possibility of further reductions in case the production levels will be revised further down for 2021/2022 than the -20% planned now.</p>

<h3>KLM to Cooperate with Trade unions and Works Council</h3>



<p>KLM’s reorganisation plans tie in with organisation-wide changes at Air France KLM. In the forthcoming period, KLM will be cooperating closely with the trade unions to draft a social plan for each collective labour agreement domain and subsidiary, as well as maintaining close consultation with the Works Council about further defining the reorganisation. This will include a more detailed specification of the conditions set by the Dutch government on issuing the financing package. Expectations are that this will be finished in its entirety in the course of October.“</p>



<blockquote><p><em>A great deal has already been done in recent months with respect to adjusting the size of our company in the face of a new reality. Unfortunately, more measures are needed in the short term to guarantee KLM’s continued existence in the future. For this reason, we are elaborating the reorganisation plan to emerge from this crisis in a stronger position, while retaining as many jobs as we can in a responsible manner and repaying the loans as quickly as possible.</em></p><p><em>KLM employees are loyal, professional and hard working. They are always ready to serve our customers, one another, the company and society at large. Recent developments have again served to prove that this is true. It is incredibly difficult and sad for KLM to now have to bid farewell to valuable, committed colleagues. Certainly in view of how much we have succeeded in achieving together in recent years. The forthcoming period will be devoted to saying goodbye to colleagues who have to leave with due care and to reconstructing KLM.</em></p></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><blockquote><p>I do hear sometimes from programmers who are kind of sad that they don't have the opportunity to write game engines from scratch like I did and have it matter or make an impact...</p> <p>-John Carmack</p></blockquote> <p>I was definitely a programmer who felt like I'd missed a golden era of opportunity. I didn't <em>really</em> start programming until my 30s. Just like many devs hoping to have an impact on the industry, it's sometimes felt like the golden era has already passed.</p> <p>Surveying the market from a more entreprenurial mindset and looking for a potential niche to fill with a SaaS app (or worse, a social network), the situation appears even more dire! News aggregators have been done and Reddit is thoroughly dominant. The professional social network is done and LinkedIn owns it. Market after market is done. <a href="https://questinglog.com/everything-is-done">Everything in tech is done.</a></p> <h2 id="technology-doesn-t-stay-technology"><a href="#technology-doesn-t-stay-technology">#</a> Technology doesn't stay technology</h2> <p>Part of the problem is the word "tech". There are two different—but overlapping—ideas that are both commonly referred to as "tech".</p> <p>By its literal definition, techonology is anything that involves <em>applying scientific knowledge for practical purposes</em>. In a literal sense, we're surrounded by tech. Some, such as the spoon are ancient and others, like the Kinesis keyboard I'm typing on are much newer.</p> <p>But people don't talk about ancient inventions like the fire bow, or Clovis points as "technology", outside of a historical context. Most people don't even call somewhat modern inventions like light bulbs, refrigerators or microwaves as technology either. When we call something technology, we generally mean something invented recently... <em>or</em> we mean something related to computers.</p> <p>Douglas Adams summed it up into three rules:</p> <ol><li>Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.</li> <li>Anything that's invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.</li> <li>Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things.</li></ol> <p>Having a musician turned firmware hacker and then programmer for an uncle, I'm a bit more optimistic about aging and see the boundary as more about whether a given technology has been widespread for a decade or not.</p> <p>Cassette tapes and microwave ovens used to be fantastic new technologies in the late 60s and early 70s. Now they aren't. DVDs, the web and 3D video games used to be amazing technologies in the 90s. Now they're taken for granted. Smart phones were incredible in the late aughts. Now they're just phones.</p> <h2 id="when-pundits-say-tech-they-generally-mean-computing"><a href="#when-pundits-say-tech-they-generally-mean-computing">#</a> When pundits say "tech" they generally mean computing</h2> <p>The rapid advances in personal computing during the 80s, 90s and early 2000s was nothing short of breathtaking. Computers were gaining new powers every year or two and PCs were deprecating nearly 50% per year! The web took the boom to an exponentially growing number of users. [<a href="#1">1</a>]</p> <p>It's entirely natural that computer software dominated the discussion of technology for a generation. First journalists, and now many of us are referring to everything from web SaaS apps to mobile productivity apps as "tech".[<a href="#2">2</a>] Since the wider meaning of tech hasn't been abandoned, this makes it very easy to conflate the two.</p> <p>But not all technology is computing and not all computing is technology anymore.</p> <h2 id="where-is-the-edge"><a href="#where-is-the-edge">#</a> Where is the edge?</h2> <p>To an ambitious engineer looking for a market opportunity in "tech", things look crowded. Advances in programming languages, frameworks, open source collaboration, dev ops, visual site-building tools and more have made it <em>dramatically</em> easier to create both web apps and mobile apps than it was a decade ago. This has lead to a flood of competition and an increased importance of marketing and other skills an engineer might not have.</p> <p>But web apps aren't (necessarily) tech. They're "tech".</p> <p>But not all is lost for the aspiring engineer.</p> <p>There are newer technologies, closer to the frontier that aren't common in in 2020 but will be in 2030. Some of them are still wide open to people with more learning power than earning power. Bio-tech, blockchain, and VR <em>are</em> tech and the technical challenges to be solved are real. It's a lot harder to ship a product in those areas than to build yet another SaaS targeting small to medium sized businesses. But that's a <em>good</em> thing if technical skills are your strength.</p> <p>For those whose strengths lean more to the marketing, sales or design sides, the B2B SaaS may represent a better goal. This is good for everyone. There's vast landscape for different people with different comparative advantages to find their niches.</p> <h2 id="you-are-not-too-late"><a href="#you-are-not-too-late">#</a> You are not too late</h2> <blockquote><p>...here's where some perspective really helps - I can remember when I was a teenager, I thought I had missed the Golden Age of 8-bit Apple 2 gaming, that I was never going to be Richard Garriott...time went by, and I got to make my own marks in things after that. And, in that time, I also see so many opportunities that have come by.</p> <p>The 90s PC wave was great - I was happy to be there, and I'm glad I took a swing and knocked one out of the park with that. But since then, we've seen mobile games, and web games, and free-to-play games, the Steam revolution...and now virtual reality. And all of these are amazing!</p> <p>So, yeah, the opportunities that I had aren't there for people today - but there are new and better ones. And personally, I'm more excited about these than anything that's come before. So, thank you very much for this honor, but I'm just getting started.</p> <p>-John Carmack (BAFTA acceptance speech)</p></blockquote> <p>The speech John Carmack gave when accepting his BAFTA fellowship filled me more professional optimism than I've felt in quite a while. Even he felt like it was "too late" because of missing all the opportunities of the 80s.</p> <p>In retrospect, that seems crazy. The web was huge and just around the corner.</p> <h3 id="notes"><a href="#notes">#</a> Notes</h3> <p><a name="1">[1]</a> Well more of an S-curve, but it looked exponential then.</p> <div><p><a name="2">[2]</a> As one commenter on HN </p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24034703" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pointed out</a><p>, it's a spectrum. In Uber's early days, its technology was crucial to its business. Over time, they'll gradually become less of a tech company if they coast and stop innovating.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We recently went through the <a href="https://stripe.com/atlas">Stripe Atlas</a> program and <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/our-experience-with-stripe-atlas">loved it</a>.</p>
<p>But the one sour note was that we only got $1,000 AWS credits when <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/stripe-atlas-includes-five-thousand-credits-this-is-what-we-got">the copy seemed to promise $5,000</a>. Our <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/why-we-chose-a-marketing-and-app-monorepo">entire application infrastructure is on AWS</a> so those credits are pretty much straight-up cash to us. We don't have much of a digital footprint either, so $5,000 goes a long way.</p>
<p>That's why this weekend was such a surprise.</p>
<h3 id="the-email">The Email</h3>
<p>Here's how the timeline went.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>First <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/stripe-atlas-includes-five-thousand-credits-this-is-what-we-got">we posted an article</a> politely noticing that we hadn't been able to secure the full $5,000 and kinda wondering out loud why.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://formcake.com/blog/the-founders-guide-to-stripe-atlas">Stripe contacted us</a> and explained that the credit amount was more of a lifetime cap and that it was ultimately up to AWS what we got.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We send <em>one more</em> email just 'cause, even though it seems clear AWS only offers $1,000 for bootstrapped startups. The email is simple and amounts to: "Is there any way we could get the full five thousand in credits?"</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Stripe responds to this chain of events with yet another email, this one even kinder and more politely worded.</p>
<section>
Hey David,

<p>Thank you for sharing the details here. It sounds like we should be able to get this sorted out so that you receive the $5K in AWS credits for Stripe Atlas users.  </p>
<p>I believe it may be the case that you applied for AWS credits with a different link than the one shared for Stripe Atlas users to activate. We do not typically see users needing to answer the question regarding funding sources. I did check in with AWS on this and it sounds like they're currently processing your most recent application that you submitted through the Stripe Atlas link. They've let me know that they will email you directly with next steps, which may take up to 4 weeks. </p>
<p>Hopefully this will all soon be sorted! If you do have any questions on this or anything else, please feel free to reach out! I'll check back in a couple weeks on the AWS front, or feel free to share any updates as well!</p>
<p>Warm regards,
Taylor</p>
</section> 

<p>It looks like the funded/bootstrapped question indicated the process had gotten miffed somewhere and <em>Stripe reached out to AWS on our behalf</em> to make sure things got cleared up.</p>
<p>This weekend we saw $5,000 in credits enter our AWS account. Keep in mind that's actually <strong>in addition</strong> to the $1,000 we've already received, bringing out total up to $6,000 in AWS credits through the Stripe Atlas program.</p>
<p>For us this is a big injection. It basically funds our full application operations and lets us play around with putting money elsewhere - or just continuing to build features and mature without any kind of pressure.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>A couple of takeaways from the entire affair.</p>
<h4 id="1-send-that-one-last-email">1. Send that one last email</h4>
<p>Even if it seems like a bit much, or things are settled, just be sure you ask and give the other person a chance to help you in ways you can't predict. A hail mary "Is there anything I'm missing?" can sometimes land.</p>
<h4 id="2-stripe-is-truly-wonderful">2. Stripe is truly wonderful</h4>
<p>Stripe monitored the developer community enough to see our initial posts, proactively reached out to us, and then worked with AWS to ultimately get us a greater-than-even-promised payout. When people say Stripe is a company for developers, they often mean its great API or clear documentation, but this is I think one of the greatest testaments to their dev-first culture.</p>

The oldest U.S. department store&nbsp;filed&nbsp;for Chapter 11 protection in Richmond, Virginia, on Sunday and will submit a reorganization plan with the court. The company, founded in Manhattan by two English immigrants in 1826, said it had about US$137.9 million&nbsp;of debt obligations.</p></div>

<div><p>Lord &amp; Taylorâ€™s owner, fashion&nbsp;start-up&nbsp;Le Tote Inc., filed for Chapter 11 along with the retail chain. Le Tote bought the rights to the companyâ€™s stores, brand and e-commerce site from Saks Fifth Avenue owner Hudsonâ€™s Bay Co. for US$71 million last year.</p><p>

The company, with 38 stores and 651 employees as of the filing, joins a burgeoning list of department-store casualties tied to the virus, which turned malls into ghost towns. Former fashion stalwarts like J. Crew Group Inc. and Neiman Marcus Inc. already filed for bankruptcy protection this year.</p></div>

<div><p>Lord &amp; Taylor closed all of its stores temporarily in March as governors ordered residents to shelter in place to combat the spreading virus. In court filings, company officials said they are slowly starting to reopen some stores and have recalled 400 employees.</p><p>

San Francisco-based Le Tote offers fashion-apparel rentals. Executives at the company have planned to cut the number of Lord &amp; Taylor stores and target younger women with luxury try-on studios, beauty subscriptions and rental drop-off points.</p><p>

Under the deal with Hudsonâ€™s Bay, the seller agreed to cover Lord &amp; Taylorâ€™s rent for three years, saving Le Tote $58 million annually. Le Tote said in a court&nbsp;filing&nbsp;Sunday that its companies reported revenue of about US$253.5 million in 2019.</p></div>

<p>The economic body blows wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic pushed Le Tote into putting Lord &amp; Taylor into Chapter 11, Ed Kremer, the companyâ€™s chief restructuring officer, said Monday in court filings.</p>

<p>Le Tote officials were grappling with â€œcarrying the increased expenses associated with the acquisition, as well as the brick-and-mortar assets which were unusable for a substantial period of time,â€� Kremer said in the filings. â€œThese unprecedented market developments, compounded by lower-than-expected financial results, adversely impacted liquidityâ€� and left the retailer drowning in debt, he added.</p>

<p>Le Total officials cut a deal with lenders to allow them access to cash to fund an effort to sell the company and â€œmaximize value for all stakeholders,â€� Kremer added.</p>

<p>The case is Le Tote Inc.,&nbsp;20-33332, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Eastern District of Virginia (Richmond).</p>

August 2, 2020 | https://jayriverlong.github.io/2020/08/02/online-dating.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jayriverlong.github.io/2020/08/02/online-dating.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main"> <article role="article">  <p>Online dating is as old as the internet. It has exploded in popularity in recent years: roughly <a href="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/2506bda6ca9a8b7ce8b3c54b4/files/1a8cc94c-6198-4f3d-b27d-8a6060ed6c5d/Tyro_Dating_Market_Thesis_Final_For_Twitter_Pub_v2.pdf">40% of straight couples now meet online</a>. It has given women more safety and choice as they participate in the dating market, and brought down divorce rates as people date more widely and make better-informed decisions than in the past.</p> <p>However, these benefits are effects of online dating becoming <em>more common</em>, not <em>better</em>. The recipe for online dating itself has been static since the 90s: some pictures, a quick description of yourself and what you’re looking for in a partner, and endless looking through other profiles. No matter whether you’re on Hinge in 2020 or OKCupid in 2005, the structure is the same. Only the volume is different.</p> <p>Disappointingly, innovation in online dating has mostly been marginal. There are hundreds of dating apps, but differences are slim. Some limit the number of daily matches, others force someone to chat first, others yet differ in their question prompts to the users, etc. These are micro-optimizations, but of minimal value because the existing model is generally suboptimal.</p> <p>What’s broken in the current model is that it encourages <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference_falsification">preference falsification</a>. Normally, preference falsification is very overt – for example, when someone lies to their friends about which political candidate they’re going to vote for. In online dating, it’s subtle – people are usually not actively lying, but they are (often unknowingly) misrepresenting, to themselves and to others, who they are and what they’re looking for.</p> <h3 id="self-misrepresentation">Self-Misrepresentation</h3> <p>People struggle to represent themselves accurately for two core reasons:</p> <ol> <li>Self-knowledge is hard</li> <li>People try to make themselves appear as appealing as possible.</li> </ol> <p>The first point is obvious, though unpleasant: lots of people go through life doing things they hate, or simply killing time. Few manage to ultimately find their passions. I’m sure you’ve met people who were all about <em>Hobby X</em>, until they dropped it one day because it didn’t bring them joy and they were doing it for some other reason. The second point is twisted game theory: people are insecure in themselves, so they try to imagine what the opposite gender might most like to see, and then to ape that.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p> <p>Consequently, dating app profiles are full of wildly wishful descriptions – <em>surfer, investment banker, loves reading, passionate about sunsets</em>. When you meet the real person, it turns out they don’t care about sunsets and put that in purely as a romantic signal, and they’ve been surfing just once a year ago but they’d sure love to try it again. They actually spend 14 hours a day working and the remaining 2 watching <em>King of the Hill</em>, but they can’t write that – what would the other people on the app think? Surely they’re only interested in surfing, sunset-loving, well-read investment bankers.</p> <p>These dating app bios are not just unrealistic to appeal to potential matches, but also as constructions for the users themselves: no-one wants to admit to themselves that they are not living quite the life they aspire to. Thus, when you give them a paintbrush, they paint an idealized version of themselves. Reading is the dead giveaway: barely anyone actually reads books, but virtually everyone says they love reading. What they love is the idea of themselves being well-read. Consequently, a love of reading is an extremely common bio line, even when most people spend less than 1% of the year reading.</p> <h3 id="false-preferences-about-partners">False Preferences about Partners</h3> <p>People also struggle to accurately identify what they’re really looking for in a partner. Again, there are two main reasons:</p> <ol> <li>Filters are necessary on dating apps</li> <li>Knowing who is a good fit for you is another, even harder form of self-knowledge</li> </ol> <p>Because of the enormous number of people on dating apps, having filters is the only way to manage the quantity of potential matches. The trouble is that people usually have only weak priors to base those filters on. This is especially bad for younger people, who haven’t dated very much, and who might even fall to peer pressure dictating who they should date. They filter hard, and consequently never end up dating <em>broadly</em>, which would be the only way to figure out what kinds of people are good fits or not.</p> <p>This leads into the second reason – you try to filter for people who will be good fits, but that’s extremely difficult to know <em>a priori</em>. I’ve been personally surprised by this many times over. Every time I thought I knew <em>exactly</em> what kind of woman I wanted to date, life threw me a curveball and I fell for someone totally outside that box. By the time I was in my mid/late-20s, I learned to filter less: romantic attraction and compatibility was actually very difficult to predict without really getting to know the other person. I learned that common interests didn’t mean much, whereas common <em>attitudes</em> seemed to be the strongest predictor of a fit.</p> <p>But many people in the dating world aren’t having those experiences now. They filter so specifically that they never learn who else might be out there. I’m reminded of an acquaintance of mine – she spent the better part of three years aggressively dating only people more successful than her – and not a single one worked out. I was baffled that at no point did she ever consider whether her “I am only dating CEOs” mantra was the wrong filter.</p> <h3 id="outcomes-and-solutions">Outcomes and Solutions</h3> <p>The dating pool is large and liquid, but the core issue is that individual participants are hard to match because (1) they falsify who they are and (2) they falsify what they want in their partners. This makes it profoundly difficult to generate matches at a better-than-random rate. Both of these issues are fundamentally due to the user having too much choice, both in how they describe themselves and how they choose others. Importantly, these are not really blamable faults of the users, and it’s clear that the current generation of dating apps will not remedy these problems.</p> <p>I am hopeful that the next generation of dating apps will solve this issue by relying more on large-scale, latent data: I am imagining an app where an amalgamation of your Reddit, Spotify, Twitter, Facebook, Google Search, etc. histories know you better than you know yourself – and that can be used to match you perfectly with a partner. I’ve been surprised that I haven’t seen such technology in the wild just yet. Probably the greatest obstacle to building a matching engine leveraging such data is that there isn’t any good training data to use, but I would’ve expected some of the big incumbents to use their datasets for this purpose by this point. We will see.</p>  <hr>  <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

      <p id="1eddbb67-5dd7-4557-bf2a-20c313c87466">My quest for programmable smartwatches lead me to a lot of googling sessions, during which I've discovered <a href="https://banglejs.com/">BangleJS</a>, open source smartwatches programmable with JavaScript.</p>
      
      
      <p id="a3b80dcb-b0c3-4f6a-9c47-ef0346ae1545">Right after the start, my first thoughts were: wow, colorful. The resolution looks good enough. Wait, what's with the weird position of the display?</p>
      
      
      <figure id="798a8fe6-d6a2-411d-b0f0-6c5e78b83a99">

      </figure>
      <p id="3a71b0b9-1814-47aa-a4b1-1521ffe66566">Watches themselves boasts that you can make your own apps in JavaScript, so lets see how you do that.</p>
      <p id="f3b14ff4-8e9a-4997-930e-cd1c21416372">First <em>ouch</em> came when I've tried to pair the watches with my phone, and found out that you need paid third party application to do that. It costs 49kč, which is something like €2, so that's not that bad.</p>
      <figure id="9d8ee628-9f27-4187-9bfd-e90962077575">

      </figure>
      <p id="2af66c09-7b54-40a2-b285-f9927c9e2b99">So I've downloaded it, paired my phone and watches and found out, that the watches won't receive the notifications, because the app doesn't support that. Lovely.</p>
      <p id="ce6b5ad2-e80a-4618-964d-d63b7eeabf6c">App's layout is super weird:</p>

      <p id="c1e4384d-fa12-41fd-9a6f-8f9e749473e2">It is actually just a web browser with Bluetooth support, so whole "app" is just <a href="https://banglejs.com/apps/">somebody's website</a>. That's actually good, because you can self-host your own marketplace pretty easily.</p>
      <p id="249ac407-6c31-45a8-80df-f0778453daf8">What's not good is that a Bluetooth support is just some basic serial console emulation, which means that Bluetooth upload is really, really slow. I've downloaded an app and the whole process took more than five minutes, failed several times, and I had to keep the app and the phone awake the whole time.</p>
      
      <p id="661f9a14-249d-4278-805b-b47417e06092">The dev environment is again, a web page. <em>Sigh</em>. You have to open <a href="https://www.espruino.com/ide/">https://www.espruino.com/ide/</a> and then connect the app on your phone, which will be able to upload apps to your watches.</p>
      
      <p id="71ce4d60-d53d-4c7a-8834-1ad6d42ede54">There is quite enough <a href="https://www.espruino.com/Bangle.js">tutorials</a> on all kinds of topics:</p>
      <figure id="a6be609f-f782-45ec-beba-cd8da02d78cd">
        <a href="https://blog.rfox.eu/en/Improvements/The_Most_Personal_Device_experiment/BangleJS_opensource_smartwatches/bangle_tutorials.jpg" title="bangle_tutorials.jpg"><img src="https://blog.rfox.eu/en/Improvements/The_Most_Personal_Device_experiment/BangleJS_opensource_smartwatches/bangle_tutorials_thumb.jpg"></a>
      </figure>
      <p id="897437ed-33e8-47ce-bbb8-8a4ef4dd31d7">I've been able to create simple application without any problems, I've uploaded it to the watches and everything worked just fine. So this part of the project is quite well done, except for the web IDE, which is obviously just the most basic editor. But it is usable.</p>
      
      <p id="2bb45af3-4640-4cf1-aa7b-04fd5a93bc19">I've decided to upgrade the firmware, because I've found this thread on the forum, from the guy that added experimental support for iPhone notifications:</p>
      <ul id="8627287d-384a-4ec0-a80a-4c581166c91a">
        <li>
          <a href="http://forum.espruino.com/conversations/345949/">http://forum.espruino.com/conversations/345949/</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p id="7df3a393-e3c8-436f-96fc-e9f1969635a9">Whole thing was really nightmarish process that requires you to install another app from Nordic (semiconductor manufacturer) on your phone, then download firmware on the phone and upload it. The upload is of course extremely slow, because it uses the same serial console emulation.</p>
      <p id="64412367-93a1-47ac-839a-9abe55900ba8">I've toyed with the project for several hours, but I couldn't make it work.</p>
      
      <p id="1b1cf268-13a1-42ec-baf9-753a8f5444c0">After a few days of usage, I've decided to sell the watches, because:</p>
      <ol id="9be79562-6724-4559-b732-d647bf67bb98" start="1">
        <li>They are huge. I am big guy, almost exactly 2 meters (~6.5 feet) tall, and they were still huge for my arm.</li>
      </ol>
      <ol id="14be9cad-1de3-4020-8aa4-31638b886e89" start="2">
        <li>They are uncomfortable. I had literally bruises after two days of usage.</li>
      </ol>
      <ol id="14eca968-11f4-48f1-9613-9390fe5c0c9a" start="3">
        <li>The watches couldn't keep time. Quite absurd really, but they diverged by more than ten minutes / day, even after firmware upgrade.</li>
      </ol>
      <ol id="a17ed4b1-8d16-4c25-b6ef-b7201ec572b2" start="4">
        <li>No easy way to make notifications work on iOS / iPhone. It is quite possible that this will get better with time, but my patience run out.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p id="8e00e5e7-9381-4006-addf-443f95c4e8de">The watches are relatively cheap. They are <em>hackable</em>, and you can really change everything. This has its disadvantage in that the community is relatively small, and almost everything is a hack, or in a <em>proof of concept</em> stage of development.</p>
      <p id="55e00f07-08a1-47d1-ad0e-511913d80313">I could probably make an app (or watch face) that would automatically correct the diverged time. I could add some kind of notification support, and integration with calendar and all that standard stuff, all users of smartwatches are used to. Everything is probably fixable, given enough attention and time.</p>
      <p id="b997dcfa-762e-4883-821b-70993572d147">Overall, I've decided that this is not the right project for me, as it is one of those thing, that act like babies; you have to take care of them, feed them, keep informed about them and generally give a lot of attention to them. And I don't have enough time for that.</p>
      <figure id="e2783c09-4d60-4eb5-835a-c7e8c1dfb8b2">

        </p>
        <p>
          Lesson learned about all alternative smartwatch project is that the ecosystem matters, and the app for your mobile matters most. Without it, you don't really have smartwatches, you have programmable watches locked out of the rest of your info-sphere.

<p>Here's something for nobody. We've been past this a long while ago now.
OOP is one of those substances that stick to the wall if you throw it.
Writing about it is almost always pointless because
people who should learn refuse to learn,
and everybody else has learnt their lesson.</p>
<p>I review and criticize
<a href="https://medium.com/young-coder/the-case-against-oop-is-wildly-overstated-572eae5ab495">"The Case Against OOP is Wildly Overstated"</a> by Matthew MacDonald.
The article itself references few other posts and I give the same treatment to those.

<p><em>I go through the main points of these posts so that you don't need to read them.</em>
<strong>Additionally we'll have</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A peek into Grady Booch's book
from which "4 pillars of OOP" is claimed to originate from.</li>
<li>How the whole <em>OOP is a lauded proglang hack to a record datatype</em>.</li>
<li>Predictable alternative for polymorphism (parametric polymorphism).</li>
<li>Why pattern matching doesn't do dynamic dispatch but is instead a substitute for inheritance.</li>

<h2>Micro-summaries/reviews of OOP posts</h2>
<p>On each post I'll go through the main points they had to say.
Ilya's post was largest of them all with 27min read,
the second largest was Karsten's post.</p>
<p>I've got my opinions inserted in and the things I pick
up form the basis for subjects that the rest of this post covers.</p>
<h3>The trillion dollar disaster</h3>
<p>Ilya SuzdaInitski makes lot of claims but doesn't bother to present evidence.
He makes that up by doing a lot and lot of claims.
There are plenty of references to popular anti-OOP stuff so it's not a total loss.
Also it's a structured post that's easy to skim unlike the others in this bunch.</p>
<p>The high point in this post is Edsger W. Dijkstra's quote
"Object oriented programs are offered as alternatives to correct ones..."
I chuckled at that one, yeah Dijkstra obsessed over correctness and
I guess I've ended up to doing that as well.</p>
<p><strong>All the claims:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>There's no evidence that OOP is better than plain procedural programming.</li>
<li>Programming paradigms should constrain bad programmers from doing too much damage.</li>
<li>Object oriented programming was supposed to be about messages and actors,
rather than about objects and methods.</li>
<li>OOP fails to keep the complexity because of
shared mutable state, errorneous abstractions and low signal-to-noise ratio.</li>
<li>Shared mutable state is hard to track and causes concurrency issues.</li>
<li>Encapsulation is a trojan horse hiding mutable state.</li>
<li>OOP tries to model the real world as objects and class trees through inheritance.</li>
<li>OOP is difficult to unit test.</li>
<li>Forms heavy dependencies between classes unless
you create interfaces everywhere and then mock them.</li>
<li>Difficult to refactor without tools.</li>
<li>Mentions design patterns, SOLID, dependency injection as band-aids to OOP.</li>
<li>Mentions abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism
 as four pillars of OOP <em>with intent to refute these</em>.</li>
<li>OOP is popular due to Java.</li>
<li>It's time to move on.</li>
<li>You're already a functional programmer
 and learning functional programming makes you better.</li>
<li>Usual defensive arguments are weak and probably never met a true functional language.</li>
<li>Talks about Law of Demeter as useless under-the-rug-sweep.</li>
<li>People try to discredit anything that claim OOP sucks.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Notable references:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Mentions functional programming and Linus Tolvalds hating on C++ programming.</li>
<li>Alan Kay's famous quote and refers to Erlang as a "pure form" implementation of OOP. </li>
<li>Stevey Yegge's blogpost "Execution in the Kingdom of Nouns".
I prefer the <a href="https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~decker/courses/280f07/paper/KingJava.pdf">PDF version of Yegge's post</a>.
It's criticizing Java programming language for sticking to OOP.
<em>I somehow remembered you could find it from the old <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/">WikiWikiWeb</a> but I didn't find it there. Just thought it might be fun to remember that site.</em></li>
<li>Reference to problem factory. I'm sure this is a reference.
<em>I just don't know this one. Help welcome! Remind me where the problem factory -term originated from? Yes, there's a design pattern called 'factory', I don't ask about that.</em></li>
<li>Reference to Joe Armstrong's "Banana, Gorilla, Jungle" -quote.</li>
<li>Transition from horses to automobiles used as argumentation device.</li>
</ol>
<p>First of all, Alan Kay's remark about classes and objects cannot be used against OOP.
<em>Classes and objects were featured in Simula programming language and it went along from there.</em>
That it was inspired by something potentially better doesn't demerit it.
<em>OOP is a datatype customization feature with an overinflated ego.</em>
It exposes decades old implementation details and makes them a principal model where you do programming.</p>
<p>The conception that you discard shared mutable state
when you stop doing OOP is the thing that keeps people in.
<em>You can do "immutable" OOP and it's not any better!</em></p>
<p><em>Taxonomies and attempts to understand the world through them aren't OOP's problem.</em>
Besides when you pick this up they point out that you're not supposed
to write classes such as a "Car" or a "Banana"
and they're just as wrong as Ilya is wrong claiming the opposite.</p>
<p>OOP was verbose from the beginning and it didn't prevent it from going.
You're supposed to buy stuff with that verbosity so
bickering about "low-signal-to-noise" ratio receives eye rolls only.</p>
<p>They're going to tell you that they're using tools for refactoring
and just declare interfaces everywhere so that it can be unit tested.
IDE refactors the boilerplate code so they don't worry about it.
Interfaces and mocks just everywhere and it is not a problem.</p>
<p><strong>On claims of unit testing and OOP</strong>,
I'm not going to go there much more because I still don't unit test my stuff.
I'm currently not against it. I just don't know about it much.
I find it much easier to formally verify things correct
than to test that they're correct.</p>
<p><strong>OOP precedes Java.</strong>
<em>C++ was raging hot popular object oriented language before Java became popular.</em></p>
<h3>Goodbye, Object Oriented Programming</h3>
<p>Charles Scalfani was "gung-ho to leverage
the benefits of Inheritance, Encapsulation and Polymorphism".
He was disappointed that the planes didn't land to his backyard.</p>
<ol>
<li>Half the post is about the banana-monkey-jungle problem.</li>
<li>Other half is about the fragile base class and contain-and-delegate as a solution to it.</li>
<li>Categorical hierarchies (taxonomies) don't work for programming?</li>
<li>Encapsulation doesn't work because it hides stateful variables.</li>
<li>You don't need object oriented programming for polymoprhism.
Presents interface-based polymorphism as an alternative.</li>
<li>Shills Elm. <em>Lol. (Scalfani's post is from 2006)</em></li>
</ol>
<p>These guys attack the pillars of OOP a lot.
This is why I did look into Grady Booch's book.</p>
<p><em>I guess it'll be also time to talk about these taxonomies and maps.</em>
Is this going to be the programmer equivalent of bees and flowers talk?</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragile_base_class">The fragile base class -problem</a>
seem to be well-covered and settled and has not affected the remaining discussion,
so I didn't cover that one here.
What it's about: Seemingly safe modifications to a base class may
cause the derived classes to malfunction.
The programmer cannot determine whether base class modification is safe
simply by examining the base class in isolation.</p>
<p>He mentions interface-based polymorphism as an alternative
<em>but doesn't say what it is or link to anything!</em></p>
<p><strong>Elm</strong> has become a laughing stock.
They skipped typeclasses in hopes that something better appears.
So far they're still waiting for it and they got full libraries.
They've done plenty of things to make it simple for a beginner
but when it comes to retaining users, LOL.
The language enforces its own best practices and it's getting to your way
by limiting the size of tuples that you can make,
tripping your homogeneous coordinate construction,
and banning <code>undefined/absurd</code> in release.</p>
<p>Here's absurd from Idris, so you get some idea what they prevent in release.</p>
<pre><code>absurd : Uninhabited t =&gt; t -&gt; a</code></pre>
<p>Non-dependent languages don't have this,
but they got <code>undefined</code> for the same purpose.
Elm has this too but it's in debug module and prevents its use in release.
It's very fun to wrap the function into a maybe
and handle it without the maybe monad,
or come up with a placeholder value,
when you know for certain that it's something that
means the program has something very badly wrong if it happens.
Nah, it's <code>Nothing</code>, tells Elm!</p>
<h3>Why OOP is bad</h3>
<p>Konrad Musial tells how he used to be excited about OOP.
He learned about circles and ellipses as objects with properties.
This is a story about struggling to understand OOP.
As an example he throws in a bit of C#.
Glancing at this code, it's not particularly complex
but sprinkled with attributes like this <code>[Serializable]</code> here.</p>
<pre><code>[Serializable]
</code><code>public class SampleClass {}</code></pre>
<p><em>These aren't technically even OOP.</em>
They're C#'s way to give code additional declarations and structure
that can be used for metaprogramming.
It's one of the flagship features of C#,
something you should definitely know how to use if you're going to use that language.</p>
<p>The post is filled with popular anti-OOP quotes and in the end
he tells us he figured it out and went back to doing OOP.
Week or two later he wrote "Why OOP is Awesome".
<em>That you don't understand something doesn't mean it's flawed or bad.</em></p>
<p><em>This one is a prose-formed text and it's not the only.</em>
<em>I struggled to go through these despite them being shortest in the bunch.</em>
It requires that I read the whole text through in at an one throw.
I just recently figured out myself the pieces I was missing to writing
<a href="http://boxbase.org/entries/2020/jul/20/on-how-i-write/">effortlessly skimmable texts</a>.
I don't say that I perfected it but you're reading one text
that's been <em>almost</em> written in this style.</p>
<h3>OOP is dead</h3>
<p>Karsten Wagner thinks OOP reached its peak and is on the decline.
Interest is increasing toward functional programming …</p></article></div>

                <p>In the last two weeks, <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterZaitsev">Peter Zaitsev</a> published a 4-part series on measuring Linux performance on this blog.</p>
<p>His writings cover the 4 main areas where you can spot performance problems on any Linux machine, with practical tips on how to draw the right conclusions. Here are the individual pieces:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Managers are responsible for partnering with reports to grow their career. This growth should be primarily facilitated by the work that is given to the report. This growth should not be primarily facilitated by “extracurriculars.” Let’s dive into some details.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of ways people can grow skill-sets: the work the business needs or extracurriculars. Extracurriculars are things that are not (or are not in service of accomplishing) a priority for the business. Extracurriculars commonly include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reading a book</li>
  <li>Doing side projects</li>
  <li>Taking an online class</li>
  <li>Going to meetups</li>
  <li>Going to conferences</li>
</ul>

<p>Companies should to the best of their ability support people who want to do these things. However, it’s a common anti-pattern for managers (and reports, and companies) to treat these activities as primary drivers of growth. There’s a couple main reasons why people intuitively lean on extracurriculars when trying to drive growth:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The alternative to extracurriculars is having people take on work that stretches their ability/skill set, which is less efficient for the business. Stated otherwise: extracurriculars are perceived as 0-risk to the business.</li>
  <li>Interests are confused with growth. Instead of finding ways to strategically grow in a role and in the company, people start growth conversations from “what kind of stuff are you interested in?”*</li>
</ul>

<p>Extracurriculars-as-growth has some major problems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The machinery of the company is not set up to hold you accountable to actual delivery of extracurriculars. Nobody ever got a raise because they read a book. Nobody ever got fired because they didn’t read a book. It’s very common to see  extracurricular tasks in growth plans only to never be followed up on.</li>
  <li>Extracurriculars are usually done off the clock. Companies often don’t make time for people to actually do that work and it’s implicit that the report needs to find time to do both those things and their regular work. Company-driven growth should be done nearly exclusively on the company’s time. Because homework is often not a priority, the company often doesn’t support it being done on the clock, and this - appropriately, obviously - leads to conflict. Expecting homework from an employee isn’t fair.</li>
  <li>Extracurriculars are often interest-based, not growth-based. So the work often doesn’t translate into any meaningful increase in impact at the company.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ok, so extracurriculars-as-growth is bad. Let’s fix it. It’s easy - skills should be grown via work the business needs. The company supports that work and holds people accountable to doing it. That growth will be directly in-line with what the company needs. And growing via that work will also actually deliver impact in a way that gets you rewards.</p>

<p>Like eating your vegetables or daily exercise - it sounds easy, but putting this into practice can be difficult. In fact, getting it done is a major culture shift. You have to build a culture that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is willing to invest in people at the cost of optimal delivery in the short term.</li>
  <li>Trusts people to fail. The other main anti-pattern is to give people a chance and then pull them out of the critical path the minute they make a mistake.</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>In the past couple of months, folks asked me how I got into product management. While everyone probably wants to hear an overly romanticized story about how this was my passion from an early age, the reality is much funnier - it was an accident. I never had any plan to be in product management, and yet, this is how I built my career. This essay is a story of how I got to be in the role I am today.</p>

<p>The year is 2012. I am a junior at Wichita State University in Wichita, KS, looking for my summer internship. I’ve always aspired to build a career in software engineering - ever since the early days when I first had access to a computer, I wanted to get better at writing code and ultimately work for one of the big companies that make the software the world runs on.</p>

<p>Now, I am dead serious when I say that it’s something that I was really into since the late 90s, when I would come to my parents’ office after school with the goal to drink some tea, grab a snack, and browse programming forums. Back then, for me it was all about the power of Visual Basic 6. No other tool I knew could make graphical user interface (GUI) design as intuitive or easy to fiddle with. I even have photographic proof of my time as an incompetent novice engineer, trying to ask questions from professionals online.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.den.dev/images/postmedia/pm/den-early-days.jpg" alt="Early days of my engineering career"></p>

<p>To give you an idea how serious I was about actually being employed by a large company in the software engineering space, I, once again, am able to summon photographic proof, thanks to my parents taking quite a few absolutely random photos of occasions that probably didn’t warrant a photo. Nonetheless, here I am, in the same parents’ office in Eastern Europe, looking at Microsoft employment information, with another tab open to the now-defunct MSDN Magazine<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.den.dev/images/postmedia/pm/den-looking-at-computer.jpg" alt="Looking at Microsoft employment information on a CRT monitor"></p>

<p>But I digress. Back in my college years, I was very certain that the kind of internship that I wanted to get was one where it will be possible for me to write code. The effort I put into learning the fundamentals of programming should be put to use in an area that is best suitable for that kind of skill. Given my experience with Microsoft folks<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, I went ahead and started looking for internships at the same company.</p>

<p>I vividly recall that there were three options that I could choose from: software development engineer (SDE), software development engineer in test (SDET, which is no longer a role at Microsoft), and program manager (PM). Thanks to the magic of the Internet Archive, I was able to travel back in time and look at the exact page that led me to make my career decision.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.den.dev/images/postmedia/pm/internship-site.png" alt="Microsoft internship site back in 2012"></p>

<p>On that page, SDE was the primary focus - it was <em>the</em> role to be in if one wanted to create software, but the PM role sounded just as intriguing, even though less emphasized. Up until that point, I never actually formally researched what the role itself entailed, and my mouse cursor was already hovering over the SDE link. Naturally, I clicked on the PM link instead, and started reading the description:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[…] you drive the technical vision, design and implementation of next-generation software solutions. You predict and research how software is used and work closely with Software Development Engineers (SDEs) and Software Development Engineers in Test (SDETs) to ensure our end products exceed those expectations.</p>

<p>You gather customer requirements, write functional specifications and analyze usage cases to represent customers’ needs throughout the development process. You’ll invest your time in partnering with other product teams across Microsoft to drive collaborative solutions. If you love negotiating, evangelizing and empathizing on behalf of our customers, the PM role is for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I was done reading it, the first thought that popped into my mind was “<em>Well, I haven’t really taken any product management courses in college. Should I have?</em>” The breadth of skills that were needed were <em>kind of</em> aligned with what I knew the basics of, but I also had no idea how to “negotiate and evangelize.” How would I even go about gaining any experience like this as a junior in college? Thinking back, one is likely to have at least a few opportunities for growing those skills during their higher education years, such as joining student organizations (<em>which I did later</em>) or participating in student government, among other things. That did not negate the fact that the path to expertise here was pretty opaque for someone that had no idea what it takes to be a good program/product manager.</p>

<p>And while we are talking about product management - you already noticed that at Microsoft this role is called “<em>Program Manager</em>.” You will see semantics of the title change from company to company, but the core competencies will remain the same. There are also variations of the PM role, such as Technical Program Manager (TPM), and Product Manager - Technical (PM-T), but that is a story for another article.</p>

<p>Before you knew it, I was sending my resume for the role. A couple of days later, I got confirmation that Microsoft was interested in talking to me - the next step was the phone informational. I briefly chatted with my friend Clint<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> - he was super-helpful in outlining some hypothetical scenarios that I needed to prepare for in the interview. All of them revolved around determining my way of thinking. As it turns out, when I was applying for the PM internship, the most important thing that the interviewer was looking at was not my earlier experience, but rather the approach that I am taking to problem solving. I tried to walk through some product management “riddles” that I found online, but come phone interview time, they all flew out of the window.</p>

<p>“<em>So, imagine that you are designing an appliance. What would be the information you would need to be able to determine what to build?</em>” was the first question that I got asked. This was <em>nothing</em> like the riddles that I was preparing myself to answer. I tried to walk through the process and mentioned that I would first do some market research, and try to understand what are the existing market needs. The interviewer and I discussed the ins and outs of how I would go about finding the right customers to talk to, what to do if customers are asking for something that my company was not best suited for, and what would be the steps to start implementing the project. My “zero experience in product management” answers were good enough, so I was moved to the next stage - a couple of days later, I got an email letting me know that I am invited to an on-site interview. Sure enough, a couple of weeks later I was taking a cab from a hotel in Bellevue to the main Redmond campus.</p>

<p>Upon arrival, my recruiting contact handed me the information sheet for the day.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.den.dev/images/postmedia/pm/internship-interview-slip.png" alt="Microsoft internship interview slip"></p>

<p>Nice! Up until that point, I did not know what team I will be interviewing for. Looking at the sheet, it said <strong>WPD</strong>, which was <strong>Windows Phone Division.</strong> That was exciting to me, because at the time I was a Windows Phone Development MVP, and the platform was near and dear to my heart. “<em>I can hit this out of the ballpark,</em>” I thought. I knew so much about Windows Phone, and I was comfortable both discussing the nice and not-so-nice things about the platform, and code around those. In hindsight, I probably wasn’t as much of an expert as I assumed I would be, but the confidence was there nonetheless.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.den.dev/images/postmedia/pm/visitor-pass.png" alt="Microsoft visitor pass"></p>

<p>I step into the building, and the first thing I see on walls around me is a bunch of different Microsoft Office posters. An odd choice for a Windows Phone building, but maybe these folks are just passionate about Office? As I step into the office with my first interviewer, they introduce themselves and start talking about their job. And then it hits me - they do not work on Windows Phone. They work in the Office division. This is going to be a PM interview for Office, and I am not prepared for it at all. I used Office a lot, but off top of my head I was not quite sure how things like its extensibility platform or the web stack worked. Things I wish I knew before the interview.</p>

<p>I am pretty sure that all the interviewers throughout that day could tell that I was nervous. The questions were a mix of behavioral, thinking big, and technical product aspects. I was so nervous, that I barely recall what I discussed during <strong>four different conversations.</strong> The one thing I do remember was that I had to whiteboard a solution to a multiplayer version of a Rubik’s cube. I jotted down how I would use XML to store and pass cube state between machines, and ensure that every player had the other cube represent the true state of their opponent’s toy. The solution needed to be designed to be resilient to network outages and potential manipulation. That was probably the only question where I felt sure that I knew what I was doing - I was used to dealing with the technical stack more so than with the human stack.</p>

<p>The day went well, because my last meeting was the “as appropriate” interview with the Outlook group program manager (GPM), who, and somehow I do remember this, wore cowboy boots to the office. Unlike the previous interviews, he didn’t want to ask me questions, and instead had me ask him questions about his organization, type of work the folks do, and his career path. The conversation was very laid-back, and I felt that I was finally through the hardest part of the process. Around 4PM that day, I walked back to the HR building, and discussed the day with my recruiter. “<em>Thank you for coming, we’ll let you know of the results in a week or so.</em>” At least it was not a no-hire on the spot, I thought.</p>

<p>As I walked out of the building, and was waiting for the shuttle to the hotel, my phone rang. “<em>Hi Den, I just had a brief sync with the team, they would love to extend you an offer for a summer internship as a program manager. What do you think?</em>” This was the moment when I realized - I will be a program manager. While I knew nothing about what it means to be a good PM, at least I had enough of a base that the team thought I was a good fit. “<em>Uh… …</em></p></div></div>

<h2 id="the-hunt-for-text-to-speech">The Hunt for Text To Speech</h2>

<p>I have been searching for an offline text to speech library for a while now.  A couple of future side projects I’m considering are a voice assistant and converting ebooks or blog posts into audio so I can listen to them rather than read.</p>

<h3 id="google-cloud-text-to-speech-api">Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API</h3>

<p>Google offers a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech">Text-to-Speech API</a> that is priced at $4 / 1 million characters or $16 / 1 million characters for the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voices">advanced WaveNet voices</a>.  The variety of voices and languages is impressive, but I was more interested in finding an offline solution, even if it produces lower quality audio.</p>

<h3 id="amazon-polly">Amazon Polly</h3>

<p>Unsurprisingly, Amazon offers an API as well called <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/polly/">Amazon Polly</a>.  The variety of voices appears to be a bit less than Google’s offering and the number of supported languages is also behind.  The pricing is the same as Google’s with a cheaper standard model and a more expensive “neural” model.</p>

<h3 id="espeak">eSpeak</h3>

<p>I figured there would be a fairly simple command line program that would do fairly basic and robotic speech-to-text.  <a href="http://espeak.sourceforge.net/">eSpeak</a> emerged as an option and I gave it a try.  <code>sudo apt-get install espeak</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>espeak "Nothing is impossible, the word itself says, I'm possible! Audrey Hepburn" -w output.wav
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><audio controls="controls">
  <source type="audio/mp3" src="https://www.xyzdigital.com/assets/audio/impossible-quote-espeak.mp3">&lt;/source&gt;
  <p>Your browser does not support the audio element.</p>
</audio></p><p>eSpeak scores some major points for simplicity.  Unfortunately, the speech is quite robotic and annoying to listen to.  I continued my search until I found Mozilla TTS.</p>

<h2 id="mozilla-tts">Mozilla TTS</h2>

<p>I finally stumbled upon <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/TTS">https://github.com/mozilla/TTS</a>, a project that is a part of <a href="https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en">Mozilla Common Voice</a>.  Mozilla’s mission, “Keep the internet open and accessible to all”, captures what they do well.  It also exemplifies a belief likely held by most software engineers.  With Common Voice, Mozilla is attempting to collect a large publically available dataset of labelled speech.  <a href="http://www.image-net.org/">ImageNet</a> was a similar project <a href="https://qz.com/1034972/the-data-that-changed-the-direction-of-ai-research-and-possibly-the-world/">ignited the development of computer vision models</a> by providing a massive list of labeled images that researchers could freely access.  With a public dataset, it was possible to design these models outside of the major companies (like Google and Amazon) that already had private access to this kind of data.  The Common Voice website makes it easy to either donate your voice or validate others.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-run-mozilla-tts">How to Run Mozilla TTS</h3>

<p>I was surprised to find that the main Readme didn’t really have straightforward instructions for how to run, or even what the end product was when you did finally run it.  Their wiki included some <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/wiki/Build-instructions-for-server">Build Instructions</a>, but after following them I was unable to get things running because the config file provided did not have all the values set.  After diving through some issues, I could tell there were quite a few parameters that even if I could identify them wouldn’t know what to set them to.  Thankfully, below the models and configs you were supposed to download was a <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/wiki/Released-Models#simple-packaging---self-contained-package-that-runs-an-http-api-for-a-pre-trained-tts-model">simpler route</a>:</p>

<p>The output was pretty good overall (this is the one used at the <a href="#mozilla-tts-quote">top of the article</a>).  However, if I were to use this in any kind of a project, I would not want to have to manually enter it in to the browser and manually download outputs.  I dug a bit deeper to see if I could extract a fairly simple CLI based on the web application.</p>

<p>I was able to modify the included <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/blob/master/server/server.py">server.py</a> file to run on the command line instead of the Flask application it really was.  I added a text argument so the input file could be passed in and updated the export to write the bytes to a user specified .wav file.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-mozilla-tts-stack-up">How Does Mozilla TTS Stack Up?</h3>

<p>The first test I ran was on a random short story I found <a href="https://www.classicshorts.com/stories/aos.html">here</a>.  At about 16 seconds in to the clip below, the output appears to choke on the word pasture.  It manages to recover quickly, but not before letting out a ghoulish “ttteeeeaaarrr” at around 26 seconds.  When I first heard the stuttering I was laughing.  Now I think I may need to sleep with the lights on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They even executed a few innocent people to prove that they knew how to kill, and in roaming through virgin fields still belonging to the Prussians they shot stray dogs, cows chewing the cud in peace or sick horses put out to pasture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><audio id="mozilla-tts-quote" controls="controls">
  <source type="audio/mp3" src="https://www.xyzdigital.com/assets/audio/mozilla-tts-stutter.mp3">&lt;/source&gt;
  <p>Your browser does not support the audio element.</p>
</audio></p><p>This was the only “bug” I really ran in to while using.  Otherwise, I was quite impressed with the performance.  While it doesn’t quite sound as “human-like” as the paid alternatives, it is a huge step up from the eSpeak option.  The project will likely see more improvements as time goes on and their dataset improves.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2>

<p>At some point I will likely want to explore the opposite direction: speech-to-text.  Mozilla apparently has things covered there with <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech">DeepSpeech</a>, a project that appears to have significantly more support at the moment.</p>

<p>You’ve probably heard the word eigenvectors hundreds of times in class and have been asked to calculate it hundreds more. But why is this concept so central in Linear Algebra? Why is it that we study the eigenvector of a matrix so often?</p>

<p>In this post, we’ll see how Eigenvectors help us immediately understand what a linear function will do to an input. We’ll do so by playing with an interactive visualization that allows us to see just that.</p>

<h3 id="quick-refresher">Quick Refresher</h3>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_scaling.png" width="300">
    Here, applying <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> on its eigenvector <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> leades to a new vector <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>λ</mi><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is in the same direction as <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. Image Source: Wikipedia.
</p>

<p>Let’s do a quick refresher to begin with. The eigenvector of a linear function A is just the vector <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> s.t. <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>v</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>λ</mi><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">Av = \lambda v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> for some constant <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>λ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> which we call the eigenvalue. At a high level, the eigenvector is just a dimension along which the linear function only stretches its input (for real valued eigenvalues).</p>

<p>This is great and all but what can we do once we find an Eigenvector? What does it tell us about the underlying Matrix?</p>

<h3 id="linear-functions-pull-inputs-towards-the-dominant-eigenvector">Linear Functions Pull Inputs Towards the Dominant Eigenvector</h3>

<p>Let’s start with an example. Take the following linear function:</p>

<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">[</mo><mtable><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>4</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">]</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A = \begin{bmatrix}3 &amp; 2 \\ 1 &amp; 4\end{bmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>

<p>Let’s see what happens when we apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> repeatedly on the input <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mrow><mo fence="true">[</mo><mtable><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">]</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>


    
    
    




<p>To play with this visualization, do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Drag the slider to increase the number of times we apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</li>
  <li>Notice how the output vector tilts towards <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v_1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, an eigenvector of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</li>
</ol>

<p>So just by knowing an eigenvector of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> (namely the dominant eigenvector), we can get a sense of what <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> does -  <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> <strong>pulls</strong> its input towards the axis of the dominant eigenvector.</p>

<p>How is this happening? And why is it only towards one eigenvector?</p>

<h3 id="breaking-up-the-input-with-an-eigenbasis">Breaking Up the Input With an Eigenbasis</h3>

<p>You’ll be surprised to see that this behavior comes very naturally from the properties of linear functions.  Let’s see this with an example.</p>

<p>Let’s keep the same matrix/linear function <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">[</mo><mtable><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>4</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">]</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A = \begin{bmatrix}3 &amp; 2 \\ 1 &amp; 4\end{bmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, and analyze applying <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> three times on the input <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">[</mo><mtable><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">]</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> (i.e. <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>).</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_pull/standard_flow.png">
    In the standard way, we'd just use standard matrix multiplication to find <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mi>v</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>
</p>

<p>The standard way to do this is to simply follow the rules of multiplication and carry out <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>v</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A(A(A(v))).</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> But instead, let’s do this a different way using eigenvectors.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_pull/split_flow.png">
    In the following discussion we will split <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> into a linear combination of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>'s eigenvectors. We then apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> to each of these pieces and combine the result.
</p>

<p>We know that that any vector <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> can be written as the sum of the eigenvectors of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. After all, eigenvectors are linearly independent and form a basis for the space (if the matrix <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is diagonalizable, which it is). If <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v_1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v_2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> are the eigenvectors of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A,</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> we can break up <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> as:</p>

<p><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>⋅</mo><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>⋅</mo><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v = c_1 \cdot v_1 + c_2 \cdot v_2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> for some constants <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">c_1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">c_2.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_pull/split.png">

<h3 id="dominant-eignevalues-and-eigenvectors">Dominant Eignevalues and Eigenvectors</h3>

<p>Now, what happens when <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is larger than <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> (i.e. there exists a dominant eigenvalue)? In this example, <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>5</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_1 = 5</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_2 = 2.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> Let’s now display what it would look like to carry out <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> when we have this difference in eigenvalues.</p>

<p>The interaction below shows this setup:</p>




    
    
    




<ol>
  <li>Drag the slider to increase or decrease the number of times we apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> on <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></li>
  <li>Notice how “Output Eigenvector 1” and “Output Eigenvector 2” change at different rates.</li>
  <li>Notice how “Final Output Vector” tilts towards “Output Eigenvector 1” as you drag the slider to the right.</li>
</ol>

<p>We thus see that when there’s one eigenvalue larger than the other (<span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>&gt;</mo><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_1 &gt; \lambda_2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>), the linear function pushes its inputs towards the eigenvector associated with that large eigenvalue (“Output EigenVector One”). The more times we apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, the larger this effect.</p>

<p>Note this “push” effect will only happen towards this eigenvector with the largest eignevalue - not any of the other eigenvectors.</p>

<h3 id="why-this-happens">Why this happens</h3>

<p>This tilt towards “Output Vector One” happens due to exponential growth. <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mi>λ</mi><mn>1</mn><mi>x</mi></msubsup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_1^x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> grows much faster than <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mi>λ</mi><mn>2</mn><mi>x</mi></msubsup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_2^x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. As such the more times we apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> (<span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> in our exponentials), the bigger the difference between <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mi>λ</mi><mn>1</mn><mi>x</mi></msubsup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_1^x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mi>λ</mi><mn>2</mn><mi>x</mi></msubsup><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_2^x.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> Hence the <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v_1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> term has much more weight in the final sum. This increasing difference is shown in the plot below.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_pull/exponentials.png">
    Due to the power of exponentials, the dominant eigenvector will play a bigger and bigger role the more times we apply A. Notice how the distance between the two expontial functions increases with x.
</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>So, just using the properties of linear functions, we are able to see why eigenvectors are so important. They show us where a linear function will “push” its inputs.</p>

<p>There are rumors about NVIDIA in advanced talks of buying ARM. Softbank has been in need of cash injection for some time, and ARM itself is a good asset.</p>
<p>The question to ponder, more interestingly, is how the synergy would work out for ARM and its potential buyers.</p>
<h2 id="nvidia">NVIDIA<a href="#nvidia" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>NVIDIA has some presences in mobile. From its ill-fated Denver CPU to the modest success with Tegra X1 in Shield and Nintendo Switch, for one, it is not lack of trying. So far, NVIDIA has established itself as an interesting player in the mobile space, while not gaining meaningful market share in the otherwise vast mobile market.</p>
<p>On the other hand, NVIDIA’s data center business has enjoyed a strong growth trajectory in the past a few years. It has established itself, rightfully, as the go-to choice for any high-performance computing needs.</p>
<p>It is likely that the acquisition of ARM won’t be for the mobile market share. With a strong CPU design portfolio like ARM, NVIDIA can have more flexibility in its high-performance computing package design. Right now, NVIDIA’s flag-ship design is DGX A100, with its CPU being AMD Epyc. The past few years, in the high-performance computing world, the role of the CPU is transitioning from computing powerhouse, to a computation coordinator. This is particularly obvious from the accelerated development pace of PCIe 4 and PCIe 5 standard.</p>
<p>That won’t be nearly enough for Jensen Huang. Mobile-based solutions such as NVIDIA Xavier have been based on the shared memory design for quite some time. While there are challenges particularly on cache coherency model for such design, a CPU-GPU shared memory design would alleviate many pains for software developers to unlock the computation power of such a machine. The recent deep-learning models have been hinting a future of at least two orders of magnitude more parameters. To accommodate these new trends, a bigger departure from current PCIe based interconnect and form factor for accelerated computing co-processor is needed badly.</p>
<h2 id="apple">Apple<a href="#apple" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>One thing interesting about Jensen is that for the past two decades, he always has the right insight. However, his endeavors were expensive for the company to pursue, with an often stretched credit line.</p>
<p>Apple has far more cash reserves for such an expensive purchase. But an ARM purchase would be a defensive move. Apple’s roadmap, while heavily ARM-based, doesn’t require radical departure from what ARM’s currently doing. The cost of inaction to Apple, would be a new adversary owner of ARM. From the past track record, NVIDIA's ARM would likely not prioritize any Apple’s request.</p>
<p>Apple had made defensive purchases in the past, and has the habit of hoarding good technology companies for many years until its technology has matured. Apple’s ARM purchase would be boring, but a strategically important one for them.</p>
<h2 id="google">Google<a href="#google" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>A Google’s ARM would be a distracted one. There are many product lines within Google that would benefit from an ARM purchase, from its mobile phone, Chromebook to its data center. The distraction and the likely politics interplay will likely terminate these endeavors prematurely. This will be an OK turnout for its competitors such as Apple. A Google’s ARM won’t be anywhere near as adversarial to them as NVIDIA's purchase.</p>
<p>A good asset like ARM would have many potential buyers. Many of them I didn’t cover here but equally likely. To me, as an interested observer, the most exciting one would be NVIDIA by far.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-9733"><div><div><div><h2>Google acquired North which made smart glasses similar to Google Glass on June 30, North decides to kill its flagship Focals smart glasses on July 31st</h2><p>Last week we had <a href="https://androidrookies.com/amazon-allegedly-stealing-tech-from-startups-under-the-pretext-of-funding-them/">reported how Amazon</a> had been accused of using its venture capital arm to fund startups only to steal business ideas from them. Amazon allegedly invested in small firms to actually obtain information about products developed by them. Amazon used such confidential information to launch its own services. Google has far worse compared to Amazon.</p><p>On 30th June, Google announced acquiring North, a smart glass maker. Google reportedly paid upwards of $150 million to acquire the Canadian 8-year-old startup, North which started off as Thalmic Labs. North was manufacturing smart glasses called Focals smart glass. At the time of Google’s acquisition, It had started shipping the Focals 1.0 and in the process of developing next-gen, Focals 2.0.</p><p>It seemed natural that Google would be interested in North as its product line was similar to Google Glass. “We’re building towards a future where helpfulness is all around you, where all your devices just work together and technology fades into the background,” Rick Osterloh, senior vice president of devices and services at Google had said in a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/30/google-acquires-north-augmented-reality-glasses-start-up.html">statement that time</a>. “North’s technical expertise will help as we continue to invest in our hardware efforts and ambient computing future.”</p><p>Exactly one month after Google’s acquisition, North has killed off its flagship product.&nbsp;In a statement on the <a href="https://www.bynorth.com/">North website</a>, it says that Focals smart glasses will not be sold any longer beginning July 31.&nbsp;“Focals smart glasses and its services are being discontinued and will no longer be available after July 31st, 2020. You won’t be able to connect your glasses through the app or use any features, abilities, or experiments from your glasses,” the statement reads.</p><p>Not only is North killing its flagship Focals 1.0 smart glasses, but it is also stopping work on the upcoming Focals 2.0 completely.&nbsp;The website says that customers who ordered the Focals 1.0 smart glasses after June 30 are provided with a refund.</p><h2>Google’s predatory instincts</h2><p>Google refused to comment on North killing off its Focals 1.0 and 2.0. North (now under Google) also did not give any reason for abandoning its flagship product.</p><p>North hasn’t provided any information on the reasons for abandoning the product. <strong>However, the company had mentioned that Focals 1.0 would be dropped after Google acquires it</strong>. “We’re proud to have grown our company in the Kitchener-Waterloo region and are thankful for the tremendous support we’ve received from the community. We are looking forward to remaining in the region with Google. We are winding down Focals 1.0 and we will not be shipping Focals 2.0, but we hope you will continue the journey with us as we start this next chapter,” North’s co-founders had said when announcing the Google takeover.</p><p>Many will argue that the North got a fresh lease of life, better funding and research facilities from Google but the question is whether Google was ethical in killing off a rival smart glass?</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

<p><span><span>Ted Han, our amazing software developer, has been working hard to combine a data-driven “back end” with ease of use for the people who are testing and, we hope, will ultimately be deploying this tool in their news flow. Several key features are available now with many more to come.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Partner newsrooms — including several in the McClatchy media group’s central-U.S. region and Uruguay’s largest publisher —&nbsp; have been putting Correx, our web-based software, through its paces. We’re getting excellent feedback, and see great potential.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From the beginning, we’ve envisioned Correx as a key way to help news organizations improve transparency and more fully engage with their communities. Straightforward corrections of mistakes are a vital kind of transparency, and can boost trust.</span></p>
<p><span>Because so much of what journalists publish reaches people via social media, we designed Correx to help journalists a) know better who’s sharing their work; b) easily correct/update widely shared stories; and c) communicate efficiently with sharers to encourage them to re-share the corrections and updates.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://newscollab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Correx-User-Guide.pdf">We’ve created a “users guide” of an early Correx version</a>. It explains how the tool works. In this post, we want to show how several news organizations have put it into action.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><em><strong>Kansas City Star</strong></em></h3>
<p><span>Last month, McClatchy’s </span><i><span>Kansas City Star</span></i><span> became the first newsroom to use Correx. In one of its first tests, it updated a coronavirus article, a topic that demands frequent updates given the fast-moving nature of this crisis.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s the <a href="https://twitter.com/kcstar/status/1268632225219776518">original tweet</a>:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Kansas City area has 3rd consecutive day of triple-digit rise in new COVID-19 cases <a href="https://t.co/FMrPCsrUDZ">https://t.co/FMrPCsrUDZ</a></p>
<p>— The Kansas City Star (@KCStar) <a href="https://twitter.com/KCStar/status/1268632225219776518?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2020</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://newscollab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-15-at-2.10.37-PM-1024x991.png" width="323" height="312" alt=""><span><span>One of the people who shared the story was @BluebirdsofMO. </span><a href="https://twitter.com/BluebirdsofMO/status/1268918965679656960">The tweet</a><span> had five comments, 17 retweets and 15 likes.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Several days later, an editor at the Star used Correx to find out who had shared the original story. The editor then, also using Correx, posted an update along with replies to some of the sharers with significant followings. </span></p>
<p><span>(Notice, in the update, the “Correx” link next to the time and date; Twitter tells you what software was used to post individual tweets.)</span></p>
<p><span>Needless to say, the most gratifying part of the exercise for the Star newsroom people was the reply thanking the organization for its “outstanding journalism” — an assessment with which we agree.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Eric Nelson, McClatchy’s Central regions grown editor, has been our primary contact at the Star since the project began. We asked him how it’s going from their perspective. His reply:</span></p>
<p><i><span>The testing of the corrections tool with the ASU News Co/Lab has been incredibly valuable on a couple of fronts. Of course, we always are aiming to be as transparent as possible with our audience, and this new corrections tool puts us in a better position to communicate with digital users when sources have changes in a story or something needs to be addressed immediately.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>But it also has provided us with a great weapon in this fast-moving news cycle with COVID-19 and the landscape of protests. We are able to reconnect with our engaged audience and give them immediate updates on each developing story as it happens.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>Readers have been very appreciative of our communication with the tool and have even thanked us for the updates and our work. That is incredibly rewarding.</span></i></p>
<h3><span></span></h3>

<h3><em><strong>El País</strong></em></h3>
<p><span>Uruguay’s largest news organization is headed by Martín Aguirre, who spent an academic year at ASU as part of the State Department-sponsored Humphrey Fellowships (part of the Fulbright program that brings foreign scholars and professionals to the U.S. each year). </span></p>
<p><span>He and his social media editor, Matías Rocha, saw the potential in the Correx tool during a video call last month, and they immediately put it to use in their own work.</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s the&nbsp;<span>El País correction.</span></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p lang="es" dir="ltr">Corrección: Aduanas aclara que no hay cambios en el régimen de compras al exterior por Internet. Este artículo ha sido actualizado con nueva información <a href="https://t.co/htazIxpjFx">https://t.co/htazIxpjFx</a></p>

</blockquote>
<p><span>Rocha posted a </span><a href="https://twitter.com/matiasrocha_/status/1279207021653393410"><span>Twitter thread</span></a><span> explaining the newsroom’s use of Correx:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p lang="es" dir="ltr">En <a href="https://twitter.com/elpaisuy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@elpaisuy</a> estamos probando una herramienta en Twitter que permite el tracking de quienes comparten nuestros artículos. ¿Para qué? 🤔</p>

</blockquote>

<p><span><span>If you look at the thread you’ll see that several people replied with praise for the news organization. The news organization’s use of Correx, Rocha tells me, “generated surprise among many and positive comments from people who normally don’t have a positive opinion of us or our work.” (Of course, he added, there were negative comments from people who don’t like anything </span><i>El País </i><span>does.)</span></span> <span>We’re looking forward to watching how McClatchy and El País, and other newsrooms that are becoming testers, use Correx. We’re getting feedback on how we can improve it to make their work more efficient — our list of bugs to squash and features to add is both daunting and exciting.&nbsp;</span> <span>If your newsroom is interested in testing Correx, let us know. </span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>First, some historical background to provide some context. (Meta: There is a TL;DR at the bottom if you want to skip to it.)</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>I’ve been an independent/freelance software developer/engineer/consultant/whatchamacallit for 10+ years. All thoughout, I recorded my business activities in an accounting software package (an ancient version of Quickbooks). I did a couple of units in accounting in my undergraduate years so I understood the fundamentals of accounting (assets/liabilities/equity/debit/credit etc.) and the value of having proper financial records. It was easy to do and made sense to me.</p>

<p>In addition to providing software services and consulting to clients, I also dabbled in creating my own startups. Some had moderate success. Some bombed out completely. Nevertheless, I’ve been trying to do ‘bootstrapped’ businesses for quite a while (though maybe it wasn’t known by that term back then).</p>

<p>Then, about 5-6 years ago, an old client of mine asked me to join his new startup. He was very persuasive. So I did.</p>

<p>However, since I was in Australia and the startup company was in California, it was just easier to have a client/consultant relationship than to be an employee. Legally employing me would mean the company would have to incorporate a subsidiary in Australia and all the ensuing hassle that involved.</p>

<p>Nah, too much trouble.</p>

<p>I remained, technically and legally, a consultant/contractor although, for those five years, I worked exclusively for the startup and no one else. But since I was an independent contractor, I had to keep my own books.</p>

<p>And so, I continued to use my accounting software package (which I’m now going to abbreviate to <strong>ASP</strong>) to record the business activities that I did for my ‘boss’. Which was just as well because I still have some recurring revenue from an old SaaS of mine. Those need to be booked as well.</p>

<p>All through the last 10+ years, the ASP been served me well. It’s not perfect, but it was good enough. Quite good for the $80 (ish? It was on special, I think) that I paid for it at the time. However, it was getting quite dated and the license would eventually expire. (I actually have it running in a non-Internet-accessible Windows XP virtual machine. That’s how old it is.)</p>

<p>One day, I was going to have to replace it, or otherwise do something about it, but not yet.</p>

<p>Then, in 2020, the coronavirus/covid-19 pandemic happened. The company I was working for lost funding and folded.</p>

<p>Well …</p>

<p>That was enjoyable: Having a regular a job for 5+ years. And I was getting used to it. What now?</p>

<p>Five years for a tech startup is … tiring (I didn’t expect it to last as long as it did). I didn’t want to rush into looking for another job straightaway. I wanted to take some time off.</p>

<p>I spent a couple of weeks catching-up/reading-up/revising the startup literature. Inevitably, I got drawn back into the ‘bootstrapped business’ game again.</p>

<h2 id="idea">Idea</h2>

<p>As the wisdom goes, the way to come up with startup ideas is to ‘notice’ a problem that you have (<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html">How to Get Startup Ideas</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why is it so important to work on a problem you have? Among other things, it ensures the problem really exists. It sounds obvious to say you should only work on problems that exist. And yet by far the most common mistake startups make is to solve problems no one has.</p>

  <p>…</p>

  <p>The verb you want to be using with respect to startup ideas is not “think up” but “notice.” At YC we call ideas that grow naturally out of the founders’ own experiences “organic” startup ideas. The most successful startups almost all begin this way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>During the couple of weeks, I tried to ‘go zen’ and notice things. In particular, I tried to notice things which are problems but which my mind would normally just dismiss as ‘that’s just how things are’.</p>

<p>It was a fun time and a challenging exercise to temporarily rewire my brain to look at the world differently. I noticed some things. I brainstormed some ideas. Some were wacky. Most were terrible.</p>

<p>And then I noticed my ancient accounting software package. It’s a problem that’s existed for many years but had always been pushed back as ‘Not now’.</p>

<p>I was surprised. Very. This problem had been dormant for many years. I had just never noticed it before.</p>

<p>I thought about it some more. The software is fine but it needs replacing. Could I create a replacement? How much work would it be? Would anyone else want it? Would they pay for it? I’ve been using it for 10+ years but I only use a small fraction (5%?) of its functionality. Could I improve it by omitting the other 95%? Lots and lots of questions.</p>

<p>It prompted me to do some research around the Internet and I noticed the following: All the major accounting software vendors have gone online/SaaS. SaaS is great for the vendor but, in the case of accounting, it’s terrible for the user. Think about it.</p>

<p><strong>Business-critical accounting data is stored in the cloud where it’s all controlled by the vendor.</strong> Essentially, the major vendors are forcing small businesses to give up control and then holding the data hostage in return for ongoing SaaS subscription fees. (And it looks like the vendors are getting away with it.)</p>

<p>No way was I, as a user, gonna go with that.</p>

<p>If I was inclined to purchase a replacement for my ASP, I would have trouble finding a suitable one that wasn’t SaaS. I don’t want my business-critical data to be in the cloud. I want it to be in a file on my computer. Furthermore, I don’t want to pay $10-$20 every month to do what, 10 years ago, an $80 product could do for another 10+ years. Think about it: $10-$20 per month vs a $80 one-off fee. It’s a ridiculous comparison.</p>

<h2 id="niche">Niche</h2>

<p>So, here, I think, there is a gap in the market. Small and micro-businesses which would otherwise purchase an entry-level ASP are not being well served by the SaaS offerings which are available. (I’m not talking about large businesses which spend much more on accounting software, irrespective of whether it’s SaaS or not. Those are fine.)</p>

<p>So … do I want to go after this market segment?</p>

<p>I’d like to … but I’m not.</p>

<p>Um, why not?</p>

<p>Because I’m just one person. I don’t have the resources/time/funding to go for that.</p>

<p>And anyway, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/14046313-start-small-stay-small-a-developer-s-guide-to-launching-a-startup">respected</a> <a href="https://sivers.org/book/StartSmallStaySmall">sources</a> recommend starting out as niche as possible (<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html">How to Get Startup Ideas</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>you can either build something a large number of people want a small amount, or something a small number of people want a large amount. Choose the latter. Not all ideas of that type are good startup ideas, but nearly all good startup ideas are of that type.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, instead of targeting the entire market segment, I’m going to go for a niche.</p>

<p>What’s the niche? Well, basically, the niche is … ‘me’ :)</p>

<p>Or rather, the niche would be the characteristics which describe me as a user. So it’d be things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Solo operator. No employees. No stock. Not a corporation.</li>
  <li>Manage own accounting data. Don’t need an accountant.</li>
  <li>Control over own data. Non-SaaS.</li>
  <li>… and maybe some other stuff that hasn’t manifested yet.</li>
</ul>

<p>Having used my ASP for 10+ years, I know exactly the feature set that I use. I don’t think I’m anyone special so there should be other people in a situation like mine. In theory, my feature set should be a good match for them too.</p>

<p>So I’ve found, or rather, noticed, a problem and a niche. And the way I’ve defined it, it’s small enough that I can aim a “bootstrapped startup” at it.</p>

<p>Do I wanna go for it?</p>

<p>Yeah, let’s give this a shot and see how things turn out.</p>

<h2 id="tldr-conclusion">TL;DR (conclusion)</h2>

<p>This is why I started GigoBooks: I have an itch to scratch. The itch has been around for <em>several years</em> before I eventually noticed it. It points me to (I think) a market niche which is underserved. I’m going to scratch my itch, and also, create something to serve the niche better. The ‘something’ is a more suitable, more affordable, non-SaaS accounting software.</p>

<![CDATA[Fixing MacBook Pro Thermal Performance Issues]]>

August 2, 2020 | https://www.dannyguo.com/blog/fixing-macbook-pro-thermal-performance-issues/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.dannyguo.com/blog/fixing-macbook-pro-thermal-performance-issues/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        

        

        

<p>Over the past several months, my 2018 15” MacBook Pro developed thermal
performance issues. Here's what I did to fix the problem. The two key changes
were that I switched to using the right side <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbolt_(interface)#Thunderbolt_3">Thunderbolt
3</a> ports
instead of the left side ones, and I cleaned the dust buildup in the internal
fans.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#the-problem"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h2>
<p>The problem first started when I noticed my CPU usage spiking to near 100%. In
the process list, I saw <code>kernel_task</code> taking up most of the CPU.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207359">learned</a> that macOS does this
intentionally to prevent the CPU from overheating.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the functions of kernel_task is to help manage CPU temperature by
making the CPU less available to processes that are using it intensely. In
other words, kernel_task responds to conditions that cause your CPU to become
too hot, even if your Mac doesn't feel hot to you. It does not itself cause
those conditions. When the CPU temperature decreases, kernel_task
automatically reduces its activity.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="fan-speed">Fan Speed<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#fan-speed"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h2>
<p>For many years, I've used
<a href="https://github.com/hholtmann/smcFanControl">smcFanControl</a> to manually increase
my fan speed because I don't mind fan noise, especially if it means getting
better performance out of my laptop or being able to comfortably put it on my
lap.</p>
<p>However, it stopped working reliably after a macOS update. I purchased <a href="https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/">iStat
Menus</a>, which comes with a well supported
fan control feature. Note that you have to buy it from their own website to get
fan control. The Mac App Store version <a href="https://bjango.com/help/istatmenus6/macappstore/">doesn't include that particular
feature</a> for some reason.</p>
<p>I turned the fans up to max regularly in an attempt to preempt the <code>kernel_task</code>
issue, but it still kept popping up.</p>
<h2 id="thunderbolt-3-ports">Thunderbolt 3 Ports<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#thunderbolt-3-ports"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h2>
<p>I found <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/363933/275342">this excellent StackExchange
answer</a> that recommends using
the right side Thunderbolt 3 ports instead of the left side ones. Apparently the
ports aren't equal. The left ones can cause thermal issues. Also, using both
ports on either side can be problematic.</p>
<p>I use a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CalDigit-TS3-Plus-Thunderbolt-Dock/dp/B07CZPV8DF/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=223U28DX1402C&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=caldigit+ts3+plus&amp;qid=1595940705&amp;sprefix=caldigit+,aps,223&amp;sr=8-2&amp;th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=thdalo00-20&amp;linkId=016d783904cae8cac9d952a3c58d816b&amp;language=en_US">Thunderbolt 3
dock</a>
for a single cable solution that handles charging and all my peripherals,
including monitors. I tended to plug it into a left port. I switched it over to
a right port and saw an immediate difference in temperature. iStat Menus reports
the temperatures from various sensors.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2oiPxjF.png" alt="iStat Menus temperature readings"></p>
<p>I tested and verified that using a left port caused the CPU temperature to go up
much higher than using a right port.</p>
<p>For a few months, this simple change was enough to resolve the issue. Luckily, I
was able to continue using a single cable, and I didn't have to plug in my dock
on one side and then a separate charger on the other side.</p>
<h2 id="resolution-scaling">Resolution Scaling<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#resolution-scaling"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h2>
<p>Then the problem started happening again. I also experienced issues playing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_Simulator">Tabletop Simulator</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive">Counter-Strike</a>,
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valorant">Valorant</a> (on Windows through Boot
Camp), all games that my machine should be able to handle without any problems.
It would stuttter even after I turned the resolution and graphical settings all
the way down.</p>
<p>I thought it might have something to do with my monitors. In my desk setup, I
have two external monitors that I run at a scaled resolution that looks like
2560 x 1440.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xPz7nXG.png" alt="external display resolution"></p>
<p>Note the warning that “Using a scaled resolution may affect performance.” The
problem is that macOS <a href="https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/1043">achieves this
resolution</a> by rendering
everything in double the size and then scaling it down. So my MacBook is
essentially doing the rendering work for two 5K monitors.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0oroxGb.png" alt="System Information displays"></p>
<p>See <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/4k-monitor-at-1440p-scaling-performance.2232164/">this
thread</a>
or <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/338581/275342">this StackExchange answer</a>
for more details.</p>
<p>I considered turning the resolution down to look like 1920 x 1080, which isn't a
scaled resolution, but then everything looked too big.</p>
<p>I was pretty frustrated at this point, especially because
<a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a> video calls started freezing up on me. I got into the
habit of unplugging my monitors before joining video calls.</p>

<p>This entire time, I thought the problem was my MacBook producing too much heat.
Beyond making the fans run at max more often, I never considered that the
problem could be that it stopped being able to get rid of heat.</p>
<p>Then I read <a href="https://quanticdev.com/articles/cleaning-macbook-after-16800-hours-of-use/">this
post</a>
from someone who cleaned the inside of a MacBook after 7 years of use. I was
initially skeptical that clogged fans were my problem because my MacBook was
only about a year and a half old. But the more I thought about it, the more it
made sense, and I didn't have anything to lose by trying to clean it.</p>
<p>To open my MacBook, I followed <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Pro+15-Inch+Touch+Bar+2018+Lower+Case+Replacement/121426">this iFixit
guide</a>.</p>
<h3 id="autoboot">AutoBoot<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#autoboot"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h3>
<p>I learned that by default, macOS turns on the MacBook when you press any button
(not just the power button) or open the lid. This was very surprising to me. I
did recall being confused in the past when my MacBook turned on even though I
didn't press the power button. When it first happened, I thought there was
something wrong. At least from Apple's perspective, it turns out <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/its-not-a-bug-its-a-feature/">this is a
feature, not a bug</a>.</p>
<p>So to make sure the MacBook stays off through the process, you have to run this
in a terminal to turn off booting on lid open.</p>
<p>To turn the setting back on later, run this. Though I just left mine off after I
was done.</p>

<p>The next step was to take off the screws. Apple uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentalobe_security_screw">pentalobe
screws</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FQndl8j.jpg" alt="pentalobe screw"></p>
<p>I've opened MacBooks before to replace <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/spicypillows">swollen
batteries</a>, so I was prepared with an
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072HNBL9Z/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=thdalo00-20&amp;linkId=09c787c5245a192a816fd263da8ad7ea&amp;language=en_US">electronics screwdriver
set</a>
that includes pentalobe bits.  I also had a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Endust-Electronics-Compressed-bitterant-11407/dp/B00HX7VZ5M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&amp;keywords=endust+duster&amp;qid=1596317241&amp;sr=8-4&amp;th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=thdalo00-20&amp;linkId=4bb9cd9f61cc6a4a158ec8dfbfb00e3d&amp;language=en_US">can of compressed
air</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/JWhg3vL.jpg" alt="screwdriver and duster"></p>
<p>I removed the screws and learned that Apple has made the bottom harder to open
because now you need a suction cup. I repurposed the suction cup from my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GKXPL6M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=thdalo00-20&amp;linkId=a201bd337a2a7814cff67674269ea94f&amp;language=en_US">car

holder</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ewlAsGh.jpg" alt="cell phone holder with suction cup"></p>
<p>You have to use the suction cup to lift part of the bottom enough to slide in
something to release a few internal latches. I used a library card.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/tDEaslF.jpg" alt="lifting the bottom cover"></p>
<h3 id="cleaning-the-dust">Cleaning the Dust<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#cleaning-the-dust"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h3>
<p>Once I got my MacBook open, it was obvious that dust was the main cause of my
performance issues. Just taking the bottom off caused a cloud of dust to come
out.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/CN5oz3j.jpg" alt="dust on the bottom cover"></p>
<p>There was also cat hair from this troublemaker.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Feill8c.jpg" alt="my cat"></p>
<p>Both fans were totally gunked up.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/IAGcS0j.jpg" alt="dust on the inside"></p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gX2FxJ5.jpg" alt="dust on the right fan"></p>
<p>I used compressed air to blow out the dust. I also used a toothpick to get some
off the fans that wouldn't come off from blowing alone.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BxW6OOp.jpg" alt="overview after cleaning"></p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/E60RF3J.jpg" alt="fan closeup after cleaning"></p>
<p>I put the cover back on and haven't had any more thermal performance issues.</p>
<h2 id="retrospective">Retrospective<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#retrospective"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h2>
<p>It would be nice if macOS could provide some actionable advice when
<code>kernel_task</code> is trying to stop the MacBook from overheating. I would have
appreciated an OS suggestion to use the right side Thunderbolt 3 ports.</p>
<p>But I also never considered that my laptop fans could require cleaning. In
retrospect, that's foolish because I've seen how dirty it can get in desktop
PCs, and I know that heat is an inhibitor to computer performance. It's just
like running in humid weather. Your body starts shutting down because its main
mechanism for getting rid of heat (sweating) stops working because humidity
prevents sweat from evaporating.</p>
<p>It would be cool if the machine could detect and alert when the fans are no
longer effective, perhaps with a sensor that looks for a lack of airflow at the
vents.</p>
<p>To prevent the issue from occurring again, I've set up a recurring task in
<a href="https://todoist.com/r/danny_guo_xlyrub">Todoist</a> to remind me to clean my
computers once a year.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Error handling in Rust is very different if you’re coming from other languages. In languages like Java, JS, Python etc, you usually <code>throw</code> exceptions and <code>return</code> successful values. In Rust, you return something called a <code>Result</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> type is an <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-01-defining-an-enum.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enum</a> that has two variants - <code>Ok(T)</code> for successful value or <code>Err(E)</code> for error value:</p>
<pre><code><span>enum</span> Result<span>&lt;</span>T<span>,</span> E<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>Ok</span><span>(</span>T<span>)</span><span>,</span>
   <span>Err</span><span>(</span>E<span>)</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Returning errors instead of throwing them is a paradigm shift in error handling. If you’re new to Rust, there will be some friction initially as it requires you to reason about errors in a different way.</p>
<p>In this post, I’ll go through some common error handling patterns so you gradually become familiar with how things are done in Rust:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ignore the error</li>
<li>Terminate the program</li>
<li>Use a fallback value</li>
<li>Bubble up the error</li>
<li>Bubble up multiple errors</li>
<li>Match boxed errors</li>
<li>Libraries vs Applications</li>
<li>Create custom errors</li>
<li>Bubble up custom errors</li>
<li>Match custom errors</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Ignore-the-error"><a href="#Ignore-the-error" title="Ignore the error"></a>Ignore the error</h2><p>Let’s start with the simplest scenario where we just ignore the error. This sounds careless but has a couple of legitimate use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>We’re prototyping our code and don’t want to spend time on error handling.</li>
<li>We’re confident that the error won’t occur.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s say that we’re reading a file which we’re pretty sure would be present:</p>
<pre><code><span>use</span> std<span>:</span><span>:</span>fs<span>;</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> content <span>=</span> fs<span>:</span><span>:</span><span>read_to_string</span><span>(</span><span>"./Cargo.toml"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>unwrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> content<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Even though we know that the file would be present, the compiler has no way of knowing that. So we use <code>unwrap</code> to tell the compiler to trust us and return the value inside. If the <code>read_to_string</code> function returns an <code>Ok()</code> value, <code>unwrap</code> will get the contents of <code>Ok</code> and assign it to the <code>content</code> variable. If it returns an error, it will “panic”. Panic either terminates the program or exits the current thread.</p>
<p>Note that <code>unwrap</code> is used in quite a lot of Rust examples to skip error handling. This is mostly done for convenience and shouldn’t be used in real code as it is.</p>
<h2 id="Terminate-the-program"><a href="#Terminate-the-program" title="Terminate the program"></a>Terminate the program</h2><p>Some errors cannot be handled or recovered from. In these cases, it’s better to <em>fail fast</em> by terminating the program.</p>
<p>Let’s use the same example as above - we’re reading a file which we’re sure to be present. Let’s imagine that, for this program, that file is absolutely important without which it won’t work properly. If for some reason, this file is absent, it’s better to terminate the program.</p>
<p>We can use <code>unwrap</code> as before or use <code>expect</code> - it’s same as <code>unwrap</code> but lets us add extra error message.</p>
<pre><code><span>use</span> std<span>:</span><span>:</span>fs<span>;</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> content <span>=</span> fs<span>:</span><span>:</span><span>read_to_string</span><span>(</span><span>"./Cargo.toml"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>expect</span><span>(</span><span>"Can't read Cargo.toml"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> content<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>See also: <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.panic.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>panic!</code></a></p>
<h2 id="Use-a-fallback-value"><a href="#Use-a-fallback-value" title="Use a fallback value"></a>Use a fallback value</h2><p>In some cases, you can handle the error by falling back to a default value.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say we’re writing a server and the port it listens to can be configured using an environment variable. If the environment variable is not set, accessing that value would result in an error. But we can easily handle that by falling back to a default value.</p>
<pre><code><span>use</span> std<span>:</span><span>:</span>env<span>;</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> port <span>=</span> env<span>:</span><span>:</span><span>var</span><span>(</span><span>"PORT"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>unwrap_or</span><span>(</span><span>"3000"</span><span>.</span><span>to_string</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> port<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Here, we’ve used a variation of <code>unwrap</code> called <code>unwrap_or</code> which lets us supply default values.</p>
<p>See also: <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html#method.unwrap_or_else" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>unwrap_or_else</code></a>, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html#method.unwrap_or_default" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>unwrap_or_default</code></a></p>
<h2 id="Bubble-up-the-error"><a href="#Bubble-up-the-error" title="Bubble up the error"></a>Bubble up the error</h2><p>When you don’t have enough context to handle the error, you can bubble up (propagate) the error to the caller function.</p>
<p>Here’s a contrived example which uses a webservice to get the current year:</p>
<pre><code><span>use</span> std<span>:</span><span>:</span>collections<span>:</span><span>:</span>HashMap<span>;</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>get_current_date</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Ok</span><span>(</span>date<span>)</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"We've time travelled to {}!!"</span><span>,</span> date<span>)</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Err</span><span>(</span>e<span>)</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>eprintln!</span><span>(</span><span>"Oh noes, we don't know which era we're in! :( \n  {}"</span><span>,</span> e<span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>get_current_date</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> Result<span>&lt;</span>String<span>,</span> reqwest<span>:</span><span>:</span>Error<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> url <span>=</span> <span>"https://postman-echo.com/time/object"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>let</span> result <span>=</span> reqwest<span>:</span><span>:</span>blocking<span>:</span><span>:</span><span>get</span><span>(</span>url<span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>let</span> response <span>=</span> <span>match</span> result <span>{</span>
    <span>Ok</span><span>(</span>res<span>)</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> res<span>,</span>
    <span>Err</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>return</span> <span>Err</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>let</span> body <span>=</span> response<span>.</span>json<span>:</span><span>:</span><span>&lt;</span>HashMap<span>&lt;</span>String<span>,</span> i32<span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>let</span> json <span>=</span> <span>match</span> body <span>{</span>
    <span>Ok</span><span>(</span>json<span>)</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> json<span>,</span>
    <span>Err</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>return</span> <span>Err</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>let</span> date <span>=</span> json<span>[</span><span>"years"</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>to_string</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>Ok</span><span>(</span>date<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>There are two function calls inside the <code>get_current_date</code> function (<code>get</code> and <code>json</code>) that return <code>Result</code> values. Since <code>get_current_date</code> doesn’t have context of what to do when they return errors, it uses pattern matching to propagate the errors to <code>main</code>.</p>
<p>Using pattern matching to handle multiple or nested errors can make your code “noisy”. Instead, we can rewrite the above code using the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html#a-shortcut-for-propagating-errors-the--operator" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>?</code> operator</a>:</p>
<pre><code><span>use</span> std<span>:</span><span>:</span>collections<span>:</span><span>:</span>HashMap<span>;</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>get_current_date</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Ok</span><span>(</span>date<span>)</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"We've time travelled to {}!!"</span><span>,</span> date<span>)</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Err</span><span>(</span>e<span>)</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>eprintln!</span><span>(</span><span>"Oh noes, we don't know which era we're in! :( \n  {}"</span><span>,</span> e<span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>get_current_date</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> Result<span>&lt;</span>String<span>,</span> reqwest<span>:</span><span>:</span>Error<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> url <span>=</span> <span>"https://postman-echo.com/time/object"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>let</span> res <span>=</span> reqwest<span>:</span><span>:</span>blocking<span>:</span><span>:</span><span>get</span><span>(</span>url<span>)</span>?<span>.</span>json<span>:</span><span>:</span><span>&lt;</span>HashMap<span>&lt;</span>String<span>,</span> i32<span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>?<span>;</span>
  <span>let</span> date <span>=</span> response<span>[</span><span>"years"</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>to_string</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>Ok</span><span>(</span>date<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>This looks much cleaner!</p>
<p>The <code>?</code> operator is similar to <code>unwrap</code> but instead of panicking, it propagates the error to the calling function. One thing to keep in mind is that we can use the <code>?</code> operator only for functions that return a <code>Result</code> or <code>Option</code> type.</p>
<h2 id="Bubble-up-multiple-errors"><a href="#Bubble-up-multiple-errors" title="Bubble up multiple errors"></a>Bubble up multiple errors</h2><p>In the previous example, the <code>get</code> and <code>json</code> functions return a <code>reqwest::Error</code> error which we’ve propagated using the <code>?</code> operator. But what if we’ve another function call that returned a different error value?</p>
<p>Let’s extend the previous example by returning a formatted date instead of the year:</p>
<pre><code><span>+ use chrono::NaiveDate;</span>
  use std::collections::HashMap;

  fn main() {
    match get_current_date() {
      Ok(date) =&gt; println!("We've time travelled to {}!!", date),
      Err(e) =&gt; eprintln!("Oh noes, we don't know which era we're in! :( \n  {}", e),
    }
  }

  fn get_current_date() -&gt; Result&lt;String, reqwest::Error&gt; {
    let url = "https://postman-echo.com/time/object";
    let res = reqwest::blocking::get(url)?.json::&lt;HashMap&lt;String, i32&gt;&gt;()?;
<span>-   let date = response["years"].to_string();</span>
<span>+   let formatted_date = format!("{}-{}-{}", res["years"], res["months"] + 1, res["date"]);</span>
<span>+   let parsed_date = NaiveDate::parse_from_str(formatted_date.as_str(), "%Y-%m-%d")?;</span>
<span>+   let date = parsed_date.format("%Y %B %d").to_string();</span>

    Ok(date)
  }</code></pre>
<p>The above code won’t compile as <code>parse_from_str</code> returns a <code>chrono::format::ParseError</code> error and not <code>reqwest::Error</code>.</p>
<p>We can fix this by <code>Box</code>ing the errors:</p>
<pre><code>  use chrono::NaiveDate;
  use std::collections::HashMap;

  fn main() {
    match get_current_date() {
      Ok(date) =&gt; println!("We've time travelled to {}!!", date),
      Err(e) =&gt; eprintln!("Oh noes, we don't know which era we're in! :( \n  {}", e),
    }
  }

<span>- fn get_current_date() -&gt; Result&lt;String, reqwest::Error&gt; {</span>
<span>+ fn get_current_date() -&gt; Result&lt;String, Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {</span>
    let url = "https://postman-echo.com/time/object";
    let res = reqwest::blocking::get(url)?.json::&lt;HashMap&lt;String, i32&gt;&gt;()?;

    let formatted_date = format!("{}-{}-{}", res["years"], res["months"] + 1, res["date"]);
    let parsed_date = NaiveDate::parse_from_str(formatted_date.as_str(), "%Y-%m-%d")?;
    let date = parsed_date.format("%Y %B %d").to_string();

    Ok(date)
  }</code></pre>
<p>Returning a trait object <code>Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;</code> is very convenient when we want to return multiple errors!</p>

<h2 id="Match-boxed-errors"><a href="#Match-boxed-errors" title="Match boxed errors"></a>Match boxed errors</h2><p>So far, we’ve only printed the errors in the <code>main</code> function but not handled them. If we want to handle and recover from boxed errors, we need to “downcast” them:</p>
<pre><code>  use chrono::NaiveDate;
  use std::collections::HashMap;

  fn main() {
    match get_current_date() {
      Ok(date) =&gt; println!("We've time travelled to {}!!", date),
<span>-     Err(e) =&gt; eprintln!("Oh noes, we don't know which era we're in! :( \n  {}", e),</span>
<span>+     Err(e) =&gt; {</span>
<span>+       eprintln!("Oh noes, we don't know which era we're in! :(");</span>
<span>+       if let Some(err) = e.downcast_ref::&lt;reqwest::Error&gt;() {</span>
<span>+         eprintln!("Request Error: {}", err)</span>
<span>+       } else if let Some(err) = e.downcast_ref::&lt;chrono::format::ParseError&gt;() {</span>
<span>+         eprintln!("Parse Error: {}", err)</span>
<span>+       }</span>
<span>+     }</span>
    }
  }

  fn get_current_date() -&gt; Result&lt;String, Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
    let url = "https://postman-echo.com/time/object";
    let res = reqwest::blocking::get(url)?.json::&lt;HashMap&lt;String, i32&gt;&gt;()?;

    let formatted_date = format!("{}-{}-{}", res["years"], res["months"] + 1, res["date"]);
    let parsed_date = NaiveDate::parse_from_str(formatted_date.as_str(), "%Y-%m-%d")?;
    let date = parsed_date.format("%Y %B %d").to_string();

    Ok(date)
  }</code></pre>
<p>Notice how we need to be aware of the implementation details (different errors inside) of <code>get_current_date</code> to be able to downcast them inside <code>main</code>.</p>

<h2 id="Applications-vs-Libraries"><a href="#Applications-vs-Libraries" title="Applications vs Libraries"></a>Applications vs Libraries</h2><p>As mentioned previously, the downside to boxed errors is that if we want to handle the underlying errors, we need to be aware of the implementation details. When we return something as <code>Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;</code>, the concrete type information is erased. To handle the different errors in different ways, we need to downcast them to concrete types and this casting can fail at runtime.</p>
<p>However, saying something is a “downside” is not very useful without context. A good rule of thumb is to question whether the code you’re writing is an “application” or a “library”:</p>
<h3 id="Application"><a href="#Application" title="Application"></a>Application</h3><ul>
<li>The code you’re writing would be used by end users.</li>
<li>Most errors generated by application code won’t be handled but instead logged or reported to the user.</li>
<li>It’s okay to use boxed errors.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Library"><a href="#Library" title="Library"></a>Library</h3><ul>
<li>The code you’re writing would be consumed by other code. A “library” can be open source crates, internal libraries etc</li>
<li>Errors are part of your library’s API, so your consumers know what errors to expect and recover from.</li>
<li>Errors from your library are often handled by your consumers so they need to be structured and easy to perform <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.30.0/book/2018-edition/ch06-02-match.html#matches-are-exhaustive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exhaustive match</a> on.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At the start of this year I decided I'd had enough.</p>
<p>I've been writing software and making games since my early teens and for most of my life I've worked on side projects. Some of them made a little money. Others grew a large following. Quite a few failed miserably.</p>
<p>My last project was an open source game development library called <a href="https://github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong>MonoGame.Extended</strong></a>. Relative to my previous projects, this project felt very successful. Many hundreds of people starred it on Github. Loads of people joined the Discord chat and it even has it's own tag on Stack Overflow. To this day, people are still using it to make their games.</p>
<p>I always assumed that one day I'd be able to turn it into some side income and maybe eventually replace my full-time job.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But I always felt like something wasn't quite working.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I tried my very best to help indie game developers make their games. In the beginning the project really resonated with people. Lots of contributors joined to add new features and a community formed around it quite quickly. This felt amazing.</p>
<p>However, this little side project took 5 years of my life. It's the longest amount of time I'd ever spent on anything outside my marriage and kids.</p>
<p>And what did I have to show for it? A bit of pocket money and a whole lot of support requests. As the project got bigger, it put more strain on my limited free time. Eventually it broke me.</p>
<p>Compare that to a game I'd previously published that only took 3 weeks to create and made roughly the same amount of monthly revenue.</p>
<p>Then around Christmas I was talking to my dad about his recent retirement. This conversation got me thinking a lot about what I want to do with the next 10 to 20 years of my life. Where do I want to be when I retire?</p>
<p>That's when I decided it was time to do something else.</p>
<h2 id="the-lesson-i-learned-about-failure">The Lesson I Learned about Failure</h2>
<p>After taking some time to reflect on all of my previous projects I realized that failure comes in many forms and some are better than others.</p>
<p>I don't have a problem with failure. Not every project works out the way you want and that's okay.</p>
<p>For example, some of my previous projects didn't have <em>market fit</em>. When I launched them into the world, nobody really cared. Luckily when this happens early in the project it's not a big deal. Either discard the idea and move on or figure out how to make it work.</p>
<p>Another project I started didn't have <em>founder fit</em>. In other words, I initially got excited about the idea and it looked great on paper but over time I really didn't want to work on it anymore.</p>
<p>But the worst kind of failure I've experienced is <em>failure disguised as success</em>. The mistake I made was not recognizing failure early enough. Surprisingly, this was an easy trap to fall into because when it looks like things are working, it feels like just a little more effort will bring everything together.</p>
<p>Unforutnately, more effort applied in the wrong place makes it worse. When the project was small it was easy to manage and I enjoyed working on it everyday. At the time it seemed like a good idea to keep adding more features and watch as more people started using it. But the downside of adding more features is that it becomes increasingly time intensive to fix bugs, update demos, deal with pull requests and respond to questions.</p>
<p>This wouldn't have been so bad if I wasn't doing it all for free. I knew at some point I needed to start generating income to be able to dedicate more time to the project. So I launched a Patreon page and immediately had a few people support me finanically. This positive feedback fueled my desire to keep going. Only now, I had another job, creating content to reward my patrons.</p>
<p>I never figured out how to make it work and it was suprisingly difficult to let go.</p>
<h2 id="quitting-was-the-best-thing-i-ever-did">Quitting Was the Best Thing I Ever Did</h2>
<p>Eventually I decided to stop working on <strong>MonoGame.Extended</strong> and handed the project over to someone else.</p>
<p>At first, this was a really hard decision. It felt like I was throwing away thousands of hours of work and letting down the community around it. But really, it was just a bad case of <strong>sunk cost fallacy.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sunk cost fallacy is when people continue a behavior or endeavor as a result of previously invested resources (time, money or effort)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I now firmly believe this was the right choice. The project is still alive and being actively worked on by long time contibutors that use it. Having a new set of eyes on the code base has breathed new life into it.</p>
<p>What I got out of it was a wealth of experience, a chance to reflect and really think about what I wanted to do next.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-am-i-going-to-do-next">So, What Am I Going To Do Next?</h2>
<p>I recently discovered a whole new world of <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">indie hackers</a> creating profitable side projects in their spare time. It's an amazing feeling to find a community of like minded people doing what I've always wanted to do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've finally found my people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many years ago, before I started spending all my time on MonoGame.Extended I built and launched several products. Sometimes they where games and other times it was an app or tool to solve my own problems.</p>
<p>My goal is to get back to my roots. Only this time I've got more experience under my belt. I've learned a lot about building an audience, finding a market, and launching great products.</p>
<p>There's still a mountain of work ahead but I'm excited to be starting the next phase of my journey.</p>
<p>Succeed or fail I'll be writing about it here. If you'd like to see what happens next I'd love to have you on the mailing list below.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>June, 2017: my partner Eve and I are stuck at the visa-on-arrival desk in the domestic transfer wing of Bole International Airport, Addis Ababa. The rest of the transfer passengers, all Ethiopian, are waltzing past us to form a monster queue at passport control. As soon as I get my precious stamp, I sprint off to hold our place before more passengers sneak in front of us.</p><p>Ten minutes later, Eve finds me, groggy from our redeye and nonplussed about navigating the Ethiopian visa desk on her own. “Why did you have to run off like that?!” Somehow, “so that we could wait at the departure gate instead of in the passport control line” doesn’t seem like a very good reason.</p><p>It was at this moment that I realized I was an unreasonably impatient person.</p><p>(In retrospect, I probably should have been tipped off by my compulsion of doing a mental <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_path_method" target="_blank">critical path analysis</a> on any everyday activity taking more than 15 seconds, but I just thought that was normal until I started dating people and noticed they often did things in a sub-optimal order.)</p><hr><p>Now that I’ve confessed to the sin of impatience, I’m going to spend the rest of this post trying to convince you that it’s actually a good thing.</p><p>(The good part is the habit of frequently asking yourself “how could this thing take less calendar time.” I don’t recommend manifesting it in annoying ways like ditching your partner in an Ethiopian airport.)</p><p>Being impatient is the best way to get faster at things. And across a surprising number of domains, being really fast correlates strongly with being effective.</p><p>Obviously, lots of these are non-causal correlations. Still, the sheer number of different datapoints is a surprising convergence:</p><h3 id="e-mail">E-mail</h3><p>It seems trivial, but lots of different people have observed that being slow to respond to emails is a bad sign, or that famous people whom you’d expect to be swamped respond surprisingly quickly.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/sriramk/status/1214278840358359040" target="_blank">Sriram Krishnan</a>:</p><blockquote><ul><li><p>the most famous, interesting, powerful people all read their own email</p></li><li><p>they’re almost universally good at responding to it quickly</p></li><li><p>they’re always very, very curious.</p></li><li><p>they have very little time. Anything with friction gets done “later”</p></li></ul></blockquote><p><a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-invest-in-startups" target="_blank">Sam Altman</a>:</p><blockquote><p>people tend to be either slow movers or fast movers and that seems harder to change. Being a fast mover is a big thing; a somewhat trivial example is that I have almost never made money investing in founders who do not respond quickly to important emails.</p></blockquote><h3 id="startups">Startups</h3><p>It’s become common wisdom that launching (and iterating) quickly is a major factor behind whether startups succeed.</p><p><a href="https://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec02/" target="_blank">Sam Altman again</a>:</p><blockquote><p>[Y]ou have to be decisive. Indecisiveness is a startup killer. Mediocre founders spend a lot of time talking about grand plans, but they never make a decision. They’re talking about you know I could do this thing, or I could do that other thing, and they’re going back and forth and they never act. And what you actually need is this bias towards action.</p><p>The best founders work on things that seem small but they move really quickly. But they get things done really quickly. Every time you talk to the best founders they’ve gotten new things done. In fact, this is the one thing that we learned best predicts a success of founders in YC. If every time we talk to a team they’ve gotten new things done, that’s the best predictor we have that a company will be successful.</p></blockquote><p>This propagates even down to the level of how quickly you deploy software changes. <a href="https://twitter.com/schrockn/status/1130569945891258369" target="_blank">Nick Schrock</a> on Facebook / Instagram moving fast and breaking things:</p><blockquote><p>Instagram was even faster operationally than Facebook. They had continuous deployment. Any engineer could deploy at any time (they would run a command called “Yolout” lol). Facebook was on weekly deploys at the time on the web and way slower on mobile.</p><p>IG story definitely lends credibility to the those-who-ship-faster-win argument</p><p>…Worth noting that Facebook learned from this. As the company grew, the release cadence got faster. First daily, then twice daily, and it is now continuous. It’s a remarkable achievement by the release engineering team.</p></blockquote><p>It’s not just Facebook; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations-ebook/dp/B07B9F83WM/" target="_blank"><em>Accelerate</em> found a strong correlation between deploy frequency and performance</a>:</p><blockquote><p>To summarize, in 2017 we found that, when compared to low performers, the high performers have:</p><ul><li><p>46 times more frequent code deployments</p></li><li><p>440 times faster lead time from commit to deploy</p></li></ul></blockquote><h3 id="appstools">Apps/tools</h3><p>The “speed matters a lot” principle applies even to things that are already very fast. Google has found that <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/why-performance-matters" target="_blank">users <em>dramatically</em> prefer faster webpages</a>:</p><blockquote><ul><li><p>The BBC found they lost an additional 10% of users for every additional second their site took to load.</p></li><li><p>DoubleClick by Google found 53% of mobile site visits were abandoned if a page took longer than 3 seconds to load.</p></li></ul><p>…</p><ul><li>When AutoAnything reduced page load time by half, they saw a boost of 12-13% in sales.</li></ul></blockquote><p><a href="https://jsomers.net/blog/speed-matters" target="_blank">James Somers</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Google famously prioritized speed as a feature. They realized that if search is fast, you’re more likely to search. The reason is that it encourages you to try stuff, get feedback, and try again. When a thought occurs to you, you know Google is already there. There is no delay between thought and action, no opportunity to lose the impulse to find something out. The projected cost of googling is nil. It comes to feel like an extension of your own mind.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://blog.nelhage.com/post/reflections-on-performance/" target="_blank">Nelson Elhage put it best</a>:</p><blockquote><p>What is perhaps less apparent is that <em>having faster tools changes how users use a tool or perform a task.</em> Users almost always have multiple strategies available to pursue a goal — including deciding to work on something else entirely — and they will choose to use faster tools more and more frequently. Fast tools don’t just allow users to accomplish tasks faster; they allow users to accomplish entirely new types of tasks, in entirely new ways. I’ve seen this phenomenon clearly while working on both Sorbet and Livegrep…</p><p>Many individual tests at Stripe would take 10-20s or more…. Because we succeeded at building Sorbet so that it could typecheck the entire codebase in that time window, it became the fastest way many developers could get decent feedback on their code, to check for basic typos, misused APIs, and other low-hanging classes of errors. Since it was their fastest option, we saw users reaching for Sorbet as their first line of checking their code fairly early on in our development and rollout. Getting even mediocre feedback and some confidence fast was much more important than anything that would take minutes.</p><p>Watching users use livegrep, I’ve seen a related upside from its performance…. Because livegrep is so fast, users use it <em>interactively</em> in a way I’ve rarely seen people interact with other search engines: they enter an initial query, and then, if they get too many or too few results, they edit it based on the result list, which gets a new set of results, which they continue to refine or expand until they hit on the results they are seeking.</p></blockquote><h3 id="personal-workflow">Personal workflow</h3><p><a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/productivity" target="_blank">Sam Altman</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I also made an effort to learn to type really fast and the keyboard shortcuts that help with my workflow.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/we-are-typists-first-programmers-second/" target="_blank">Steve Yegge via Jeff Atwood</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I was trying to figure out which is the most important computer science course a CS student could ever take, and eventually realized it’s Typing 101.</p><p>The really great engineers I know, the ones who build great things, they can type.</p></blockquote><p>This matches my experience at Wave, where the best engineers are disproportionately likely to type quickly, know their keyboard shortcuts, and have invested a lot of time making their common tasks efficient.</p><p>Obviously, those aren’t the main things that make them good engineers—but I think they help in more than just the obvious ways.</p><h3 id="negotiations">Negotiations</h3><p>At Wave, when hiring, we’ve noticed that moving someone through the hiring process faster makes them <em>much</em> more likely to accept our offer. If we take a long time to get back to them or schedule the next steps, it both gives them more time to lose interest, and makes it seem like we’re not excited about them. Not a good look!</p><p>This is apparently common trope in sales as well—<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1204077/time-kills-deals" target="_blank">“time kills all deals”</a>.</p><p>Paul Graham on <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ds.html" target="_blank">how the founders of Stripe got time on their side</a>:</p><blockquote><p>At YC we use the term “Collison installation” for the technique they invented. More diffident founders ask “Will you try our beta?” and if the answer is yes, they say “Great, we’ll send you a link.” But the Collison brothers weren’t going to wait. When anyone agreed to try Stripe they’d say “Right then, give me your laptop” and set them up on the spot.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://avc.com/2018/08/strike-when-the-iron-is-hot/" target="_blank">Fred Wilson</a> on the same effect in networking:</p><blockquote><p>That night when I got home I told the Gotham Gal “I met Danny Meyer today and he gave me his card and said I could call him whenever I need a table.” To which she replied “go there for lunch tomorrow.” And I told her “I don’t have a lunch tomorrow.” She said “Get one. He will remember who you are tomorrow but won’t next month.”</p></blockquote><h3 id="combat">Combat</h3><p>One of the most influential military strategy writers, John Boyd, is most famous for the idea of the “OODA loop:” that human action is an iterated process of <em>observing</em> the world, <em>orienting</em> within it, <em>deciding</em> how to respond and finally <em>acting</em> on the decision. Boyd’s claim was that <em>going through the OODA loop faster was a decisive advantage</em>:</p><blockquote><p>In order to win, we should operate at a faster tempo or rhythm than our adversaries—or, better yet, get inside [the] adversary’s Observation-Orientation-Decision-Action time cycle or loop … Such activity will make us appear ambiguous (unpredictable) thereby generate confusion and disorder among our adversaries—since our adversaries will be unable to generate mental images or pictures that agree with the menacing, as well as faster transient rhythm or patterns, they are competing against.</p></blockquote><p>As a recent example, for instance, many states and countries <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/macovid/">waited far too long</a> to lock down when the COVID epidemic hit because <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/03/09/plot-economics/" target="_blank">the virus got inside their OODA loop</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Right now, the perception of agency at all levels is falling. Individuals, corporations, governments, heads of state, stock traders, the UN, <em>everybody</em> feels they’re losing the plot, but they don’t see anybody else <em>finding</em> it….

August 2, 2020 | https://www.jibranelbazi.com/blog/what-is-a-product-roadmap | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.jibranelbazi.com/blog/what-is-a-product-roadmap">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>When I was still a kid, I was always so excited to sit in the front passenger seat on holiday trips. You see, there were no navigation devices yet, and thus we had a physical roadmap. My dad frequently knew the route from memory, but I was eager to follow along on the map (and point out when we could find a quicker or alternative route).</p><p>My excitement for maps has not gone away. It's not coincidental that I'm currently writing about roadmaps in another, similar, sense—product roadmaps.</p><p>In general, the power of a map is to help you get to a destination. But how we create and use product roadmaps is essential. <a href="https://www.jibranelbazi.com/blog/why-you-should-look-at-everything-as-a-process">It is a process</a> that is both creative and analytical.</p><p>In this series, I aim to guide you through everything you need to know about creating the ultimate product roadmap. In this first installment, I aim to explain what a product roadmap is and why it's such a great tool.</p><h2>What is the purpose of a product roadmap?</h2><p>Let me first tell you what I feel is a good definition of a Product Roadmap, which will help us frame the rest of the points in this guide.</p><blockquote><em>"A product roadmap is a high-level visual summary that maps out the vision and direction of your product offering." - </em><a href="https://www.productplan.com/"><em>ProductPlan</em></a></blockquote><p>We're going to break down the definition step by step, so we understand what it entails.</p><h3><strong>"high-level"</strong>‍</h3><p>This means we don't go into the details of a product vision too much (that's what backlogs are for). We need the roadmap to stay on a strategic level where we can use it to set the course over the long term. To illustrate: think about a ship sailing to some destination. A captain on the vessel needs to look out over the horizon for direction. In contrast, an engineer on the same boat takes care of the machines in the engine room: both necessary for the end goal, but very different levels of focus.</p><h3><strong>"visual"</strong>‍</h3><p>This means the product roadmap, like a land roadmap, can be understood without needing to read it (apart from titles, notes, names, etc.). Visual representation helps make the roadmap easier and quicker to understand, which is necessary to get buy-in from everyone involved.</p><h3><strong>"summary"</strong>‍</h3><p>This is similar in the "high-level" part we saw earlier. (Not focus on all the details.) But it does drive home the point that the roadmap should simplify, but definitely not leave out critical parts of the vision. Doing this is hard, especially when a product is big. Note, summarizing is a continuous process.</p><h3><strong>"vision"</strong>‍</h3><p>This means the "why" of a product. Why create the product in the first place? What goal does it have? What is the value proposition for users? What is the incentive for the business to create this product? Tip, don't spend a lot of time creating a product roadmap before your vision is crystal clear.</p><h3><strong>"direction"</strong>‍</h3><p>This means the execution part of getting to a finished product. It is "how" you go from nothing to providing the value intended. Do I need to say this is important? Well, yes, it is; it is essential. In the execution plan, you find most detail (and struggles) while creating and updating the product roadmap. After you formed a product vision (<a href="https://www.jibranelbazi.com/blog/why-product-market-fit-is-not-enough">hopefully in line with your customers and your company!</a>), most stakeholders don't sway from that idea. The route to that goal, however, is a bumpy and complicated road. (I'm almost getting ahead of myself in wanting to talk more about this here, but there will be multiple sections where we'll get into the details of this!)</p><h3><strong>"product offering"</strong>‍</h3><p>This means "what" you'll eventually end up creating—the finished product. The whole reason you create a product roadmap is to offer a valuable product to the end-user, your customer.</p><p><em>An interesting aside. Maybe you're already familiar with the last three parts from the definition (vision, direction, and product offering) but under different wording. </em><a href="https://simonsinek.com/"><em>Simon Sinek</em></a><em> talks about the "why, how, and what" (vision, direction, and product offering, respectively). He calls it the "Golden Circle" by his book with the same name.</em></p><h2>What does a product roadmap look like?</h2><p>A product roadmap can take many forms, feature-based, goal-based, time based, release-based, and a few more. But good roadmaps have a few things in common.</p><ul role="list"><li>They are timed based (be it specific dates or timelines).</li><li>They have more detail for near term (higher priority) items than for later (lower priority) items.</li><li>They have 'themes' as the highest level (like "increase customer retention for yearly subscribers"), not features.</li></ul><p><strong>Here's an example of a roadmap (</strong><a href="https://roadmunk.com/"><strong>source</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p><figure id="w-node-47cfe779986d-8ab48f91"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d9f07d3a410722397e9fd77/5f233514485d617b4cac9b6e_homepage-slider-1-1.png" alt="Roadmap example from roadmunk"></p></figure><p>In the next article, I will walk you through the details of an example product roadmap. As well as listing the different types of product roadmaps that are possible to make. First I'll tell you a bit more about how you can use your roadmap.</p><h2>How can you use a product roadmap?</h2><p>Ok, so now you know what a product roadmap is supposed to do and what it looks like. Right? Well, on a high level, yes. But the utilization of a product roadmap becomes even more evident in the specific cases you use it.</p><p>These are all about people, social dynamics, collaboration, and communication. You can use a product roadmap</p><ol role="list"><li>as a reference document for the (Scrum )team.</li><li>to get stakeholder alignment.</li><li>to provide options for planning and conversation.</li><li>to prevent someone from 'hijacking' your sprints.</li><li>to tell a story to your customers.</li></ol><p>These five uses all come down to the most important reason for creating a product roadmap. To set the narrative of your product vision and execution.</p><blockquote><em>A Product Roadmap is a narrative tool.</em></blockquote><p>With a product roadmap you can tell a story of intent. The intent to build a product towards a certain goal. This narrative is essential to get others to work with you in creating great products.</p><p><em>There is one crucial point I want to drive home. A product roadmap is a living document. The things you plan are not set in stone. The product you're building is undergoing iteration upon iteration. Thus your roadmap should reflect the latest findings and details, especially in the age of Agile and Lean (software) development.</em></p><h2>Closing thoughts</h2><p>Hopefully, you're now familiar with the idea of what a product roadmap is, why you should use one, and what it looks like.</p><p>If you have any questions, thoughts, or feel something is missing, please do shoot me a message on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/askjibran">Twitter</a>.</p><p>By the way, I also created a checklist with "<a href="https://www.jibranelbazi.com/notes/product-roadmap-checklist">40 Product Roadmap tips</a>." So if you can't wait to get into creating and using a product roadmap, I highly recommend you check it out.</p><h2>Support</h2><p>If you'd like to see more content like this, I'd be thrilled to have you join my <a href="https://www.jibranelbazi.com/newsletter">mailing list.</a></p></article></div>]]>

August 2, 2020 | https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/when-i-raised-my-b2b-saass-prices/7017 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/when-i-raised-my-b2b-saass-prices/7017">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>When I launched Feature Upvote, my B2B SaaS, in 2017, the price was $29/month, with a 20% discount for paying yearly. I chose that price  arbitrarily, but also because it is what I felt I would pay for a similar service.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2006/08/14/you-can-probably-stand-to-charge-more/">hearing repeatedly that developers who start businesses need to charge more</a>, I wanted to experiment with a small increase.</p>
<p>I delayed doing this until I had enough new customers each month to really be sure of the price change’s effect.</p>
<p>In January 2019 I put the price up to $35/month, a 20% increase.</p>
<p>Why such a small increase? I knew in theory that I should charge significantly more, but in practice I wasn’t confident about it. I am, after all, still a developer <img src="https://sjc3.discourse-cdn.com/business6/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" alt=":slight_smile:"> .</p>
<p>What happened? The conversion rate stayed roughly the same. That is, the same number of new customers per month, but each paying more.</p>
<p>Nobody complained. Ever. Not a single person questioned the change in our pricing.</p>
<p>A year later, in January 2020 I got bolder. I put the price up to $49/month, a 40% increase.</p>
<p>What happened? The conversion rate initially dropped a little but not much. It might have just been statistical noise, or the post-Christmas lull.</p>
<p>I was  getting fewer new customers, but they were paying more. Pricing experts say that customers who pay more tend to remain customers longer, resulting in a much higher customer life time value, so this seemed okay.</p>
<p>Then the pandemic started and we were all in shock and sales stalled for a little while. So it was really hard to tell the true effect of the price increase.</p>
<p>But now, six months later, I’m signing up more new customers than ever, at the conversion rate we had before the price increase.</p>
<p>As with the first price change, nobody complained. Ever.</p>
<h2>What about existing customers?</h2>
<p>I’ve never put up prices for existing customers. I’m okay with people getting the price they started with indefinitely. It is the way I’d want to be treated as a customer. Anyway, within a couple of years, as existing customers churn, the “problem” of older customers paying less will simply go away.</p>
<h2>Has the customer base changed?</h2>
<p>Yes. As the price goes up we tend to get larger organisations as customers. Unfortunately, they are also more likely to ask for custom legals, T&amp;Cs, and security audits. In all cases, I say no. That may change in the future.</p>
<h2>What did I tell existing customers about the price change?</h2>
<p>Nothing. I probably should have, but it fell off my to-do list.</p>
<p>To make sure existing trial customers weren’t shown one price and charged another, I did the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>December 2019: change the prices listed on our pricing page, but still charge new customers the old pricing.</li>
<li>January 2020: start actually charging the new prices.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Other pricing plans</h2>
<p>I have bootstrapper pricing at $19/month (with a 20% discount when paying yearly). I’ve had this pricing since the very start, and never changed it. It is an easy way to answer would-be customers who write “I want to use Feature Upvote, but it is too expensive for me.”</p>
<p>For charities or non-profits who ask, we have a plan that’s 25% cheaper. Almost no-one asks for this plan. I don’t know why, because it is featured on our pricing page.</p>
<p>Just about any Open Source project that asks can use us for free. There are a couple of stipulations, but I tend not to check too carefully.</p>
<h2>Do I charge enough?</h2>
<p>I don’t know. I’m content with the pricing now, and have no plans to change it in the near future. Next year I might add a much more expensive enterprise plan, for those people who ask about custom legals, T&amp;Cs, and security audits.</p>

		<p>When it comes to recruitment interviews, there's an overwhelmingly popular opinion (on the Internet) that one should test candidates in conditions that do resemble <strong>real-life work scenarios</strong> as much as possible. Tasks &amp; challenges should mimic the ones that the candidate would face in her/his daily work. Everything else (<em>"how many golf balls would fit into Opel Corsa?"</em>) is the subject of laughter and mockery.</p><p>I dare to disagree. My interviews are nothing like real work (but TBH we have a final stage of a "trial day" within the actual team, mainly to check <em>the chemistry</em> between a potential new-joiner and the team members and to give her/him a chance to verify what we've said about the company).</p><p>A recruitment interview is a freaking intense experience. We have a strictly limited time - we can't build full context to get someone up-to-speed with the product details, local specifics, whole workflow, etc. Of course, we can try easy, shallow, "mundane" scenario, but let's face the truth - we need to evaluate candidate's capability to tackle TRULY demanding stuff (most likely <strong>10% of the actual work</strong> (s)he'll perform - but that part truly makes the difference).</p><p>The purpose of the interview is not to emulate work 1:1, but to answer certain questions: about particular personality traits, attitude, aptitude, mindset. Technical skills can always be taught later - if someone has a matching motivation, proper engineering foundation, is bright enough and has an ability of structured abstract thinking.</p><p>That's why my interviews are aimed to check how does the individual think (instead of verifying her/his memorization skills). How does (s)he approach problems, split them, classify them, explore possible solutions? When does (s)he abandon the path that doesn't look promising anymore? Is (s)he able to effectively share her/his thoughts (verbally, graphically, in code)? What about focus - does (s)he navigate in terms of a given goal or roam chaotically around? And in the end ... <strong>is (s)he actually having fun</strong> (when solving challenging problems)?</p><p>Call me old-fashioned, but I do ask abstract questions as well. The problems candidates are facing at my interviews usually have NOTHING in common with the company's domain, BUT they have a super-low entry level (e.g. they are about common problems everyone encounters every day): building up the context takes seconds (literally), so the candidate can focus on tackling the problem, not understanding its basics. They also share one another characteristic: they are picked to be <strong>unique, intriguing and memorable</strong> - so regardless of the outcome (whether the candidate joins us or not), our interview remains an interesting experience in her/his memory.</p><p>There are ones who are surprised and do criticize such a form of the interview. They usually ask whether these exercises truly represent the everyday problems of this organization. Some even get irritated (very few) - but no-one has asked to stop the interview prematurely.</p><p>Honestly, I don't mind. These days candidates get very picky - they have so many offers available in the market, that the less gritty ones don't even want to participate in the interview that exposes them to the challenges out of their comfort zone (e.g. which is - syntactical language problems or knowing the specifics of the framework). It's their right, but it also means they are definitely <strong>not the people I'm looking for</strong>.</p><hr><p>P.S. Of course, sometimes (rarely) I look for a high level of expertise within a specific technological niche - that requires a different assessment and it's a completely separate topic.</p>

Over the same period of time they have created a wide range of computer vision and data analysis tools which have the potential to change forms of policing and incarceration in many places around the world.

<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Technology’s Double-Edged Sword</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The global COVID-19 pandemic has made clear that Chinese technology companies are at the cutting edge of surveillance innovation and predictive analytics. In April 2020, Amazon, the wealthiest technology company in the world, received a shipment of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-amazon-com-cameras/exclusive-amazon-turns-to-chinese-firm-on-u-s-blacklist-to-meet-thermal-camera-needs-idUSKBN22B1AL"><span data-contrast="none">1,500 heat-sensing camera systems</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;from the Chinese surveillance company&nbsp;Dahua. Many of these cameras, which are worth approximately $10 million, will be installed in Amazon warehouses to monitor the heat signatures of employees and alert managers if workers exhibit COVID-19-like symptoms. Other cameras included in the shipment will be distributed to IBM and Chrysler, among other buyers.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In 2017,&nbsp;Dahua&nbsp;received over $900 million to build comprehensive surveillance systems which supported a “re-education” system of extra-legal internment, checkpoints, and ideological training for&nbsp;</span><a href="https://ipvm.com/reports/xinjiang-dahua-hikvision"><span data-contrast="none">Muslim populations in northwestern China</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Since then, the U.S. Department of Commerce placed it on a list of companies banned from buying or selling in the United States. Yet despite the legal and ethical ramifications of buying products from&nbsp;Dahua, Amazon continues to do business with them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With the help of&nbsp;Dahua&nbsp;and hundreds of other private and public Chinese companies, as many as 1.5 million Uighurs and Kazakhs have been “disappeared” into a widespread system of “re-education camps” in the Uighur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang).[1]</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">Nearly all Uighurs and Kazakhs in China have an immediate family member who is, or has been, interned in this camp system. Uighurs now refer to themselves as a “</span><a href="https://livingotherwise.com/2018/07/31/happiest-muslims-world-coping-happiness/"><span data-contrast="none">people destroyed</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.” As I observed during a research trip to the region in 2018, many Uighur-owned businesses have closed across the country. Whole streets have been abandoned in Uighur towns and villages. Because of the re-education system, it is likely that within a single generation Muslim embodied practice and Turkic languages in Northwest China will cease to provide essential ways for Uighurs and Kazakhs to sustain their knowledge systems.[2]&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">This process affects every aspect of their lives not only due to mass detentions, but also because of the way biometric and data surveillance systems supporting the camps have been used to monitor and transform their behavior.</span><span data-contrast="auto">[3]</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">This terrain assessment describes how Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang were targeted by digital and biometric surveillance technologies of the “re-education” system.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">People who were not immediately detained were nevertheless ordered to go to local police stations and clinics to submit blood and <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/12/13/china-minority-region-collects-dna-millions">DNA samples</a> have their irises, faces and fingerprints scanned and a unique voice signature recorded.</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">One Kazakh woman told me, “The village government leader told us openly that those who refused would be taken to the re-education camps.” This biometric data was then added to their citizenship file as part of a new “smart” ID card system. Once this system was fully implemented by the end of 2017, it became impossible for Uighurs and Kazakhs to enter a bank or shopping mall without having their face scanned and matched to the image on their ID at fixed checkpoints. Han people were often waved through these checkpoints without a scan,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://chinachannel.org/2018/11/23/checkpoint-nation/"><span data-contrast="none">particularly in Turkic Muslim majority areas</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;The Kazakh woman told me, “On average, over the span of a single day, I had my ID and face scanned more than 10 times.”&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It is unclear how all of this data is used. As James&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">Leibold</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;has noted, there is likely a significant gap between the advertised capacities of the systems in place and their actual ability to turn biometric and digital data into actionable forms of social control.</span><span data-contrast="auto">[9]</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">Much of the data in the IJOP system is input manually or through targeted scans of smart phones, while other forms of data are fed into the system through banking records, GPS tracking and license plate and face recognition camera systems. Yet despite potential gaps in purported knowledge and technical capability, the ubiquity of checkpoints and cameras make Turkic Muslims modify their behavior in their daily life and reorient their activities around ideals promoted by state authorities. The technologies begin to create a new reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">The Logic of Chinese Counterterrorism&nbsp;</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The history of Chinese counterterrorism is born largely out of post-9/11 counterinsurgency theory (COIN). Soon after U.S. Army General Petraeus crafted a new counterinsurgency field manual in 2007, Chinese military and policing scientists began to consider what they could learn from a <a href="https://madeinchinajournal.com/2019/10/25/preventative-policing-as-community-detention-in-northwest-china/">new approach</a> to asymmetrical warfare.</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">They considered central COIN principles such as full spectrum intelligence; placing people in categories of insurgent, neutral, and pro-regime change populations; breaking up social networks through targeted detentions; and “winning the hearts and minds” of those who remained.[10]</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    
    
    <p>I recently got to use a very curious Haskell technique
<span>
<label for="production-note">in production:</label>

<span>
<span>[note:</span>

As production as research code gets, anyway!

<span>]</span>
</span>
</span>
 time traveling. I say this with
the utmost seriousness. This technique worked like
magic for the problem I was trying to solve, and so
I thought I’d share what I learned. In addition
to the technique and its workings, I will also explain how
time traveling can be misused, yielding computations that
never terminate.</p>
<h3 id="time-traveling">Time Traveling</h3>
<p>Some time ago, I read <a href="https://kcsongor.github.io/time-travel-in-haskell-for-dummies/">this post</a> by Csongor Kiss about time traveling in Haskell. It’s
really cool, and makes a lot of sense if you have wrapped your head around
lazy evaluation. I’m going to present my take on it here, but please check out
Csongor’s original post if you are interested.</p>
<p>Say that you have a list of integers, like <code>[3,2,6]</code>. Next, suppose that
you want to find the maximum value in the list. You can implement such
behavior quite simply with pattern matching:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="Haskell"><span>myMax</span> <span>::</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>myMax</span> <span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>error</span> <span>"Being total sucks"</span>
<span>myMax</span> (x<span>:</span>xs) <span>=</span> max x <span>$</span> myMax xs
</code></pre></div>
<p>You could even get fancy with a <code>fold</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="Haskell"><span>myMax</span> <span>::</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>myMax</span> <span>=</span> foldr1 max
</code></pre></div>
<p>All is well, and this is rather elementary Haskell. But now let’s look at
something that Csongor calls the <code>repMax</code> problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine you had a list, and you wanted to replace all the elements of the
list with the largest element, by only passing the list once.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How can we possibly do this in one pass? First, we need to find the maximum
element, and only then can we have something to replace the other numbers
with! It turns out, though, that we can just expect to have the future
value, and all will be well. Csongor provides the following example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="Haskell"><span>repMax</span> <span>::</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> (<span>Int</span>, [<span>Int</span>])
<span>repMax</span> <span>[]</span> rep <span>=</span> (rep, <span>[]</span>)
<span>repMax</span> [x] rep <span>=</span> (x, [rep])
<span>repMax</span> (l <span>:</span> ls) rep <span>=</span> (m', rep <span>:</span> ls')
  <span>where</span> (m, ls') <span>=</span> repMax ls rep
        m' <span>=</span> max m l
</code></pre></div>
<p>In this example, <code>repMax</code> takes the list of integers,
each of which it must replace with their maximum element.
It also takes <strong>as an argument</strong> the maximum element,
as if it had already been computed. It does, however,
still compute the intermediate maximum element,
in the form of <code>m'</code>. Otherwise, where would the future
value even come from?</p>
<p>Thus far, nothing too magical has happened. It’s a little
strange to expect the result of the computation to be
given to us; it just looks like wishful
thinking. The real magic happens in Csongor’s <code>doRepMax</code>
function:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="Haskell"><span>doRepMax</span> <span>::</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>]
<span>doRepMax</span> xs <span>=</span> xs'
  <span>where</span> (largest, xs') <span>=</span> repMax xs largest
</code></pre></div>
<p>Look, in particular, on the line with the <code>where</code> clause.
We see that <code>repMax</code> returns the maximum element of the
list, <code>largest</code>, and the resulting list <code>xs'</code> consisting
only of <code>largest</code> repeated as many times as <code>xs</code> had elements.
But what’s curious is the call to <code>repMax</code> itself. It takes
as input <code>xs</code>, the list we’re supposed to process… and
<code>largest</code>, the value that <em>it itself returns</em>.</p>
<p>This works because Haskell’s evaluation model is, effectively,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_reduction">lazy graph reduction</a>. That is,
you can think of Haskell as manipulating your code as
<span>
<label for="tree-note">a syntax tree,</label>

<span>
<span>[note:</span>

Why is it called graph reduction, you may be wondering, if the runtime is
manipulating syntax trees? To save on work, if a program refers to the
same value twice, Haskell has both of those references point to the
exact same graph. This violates the tree's property of having only one path
from the root to any node, and makes our program a DAG (at least). Graph nodes that
refer to themselves (which are also possible in the model) also violate the properties of a
a DAG, and thus, in general, we are working with graphs.

<span>]</span>
</span>
</span>
 performing
substitutions and simplifications as necessary until it reaches a final answer.
What the lazy part means is that parts of the syntax tree that are not yet
needed to compute the final answer can exist, unsimplified, in the tree.
Why don’t we draw a few graphs to get familiar with the idea?</p>
<h3 id="visualizing-graphs-and-their-reduction">Visualizing Graphs and Their Reduction</h3>
<p>Let’s start with something that doesn’t have anything fancy. We can
take a look at the graph of the expression:</p>

<p>Stripping away Haskell’s syntax sugar for lists, we can write this expression as:</p>

<p>Then, recalling that <code>(:)</code>, or ‘cons’, is just a binary function, we rewrite:</p>

<p>We’re now ready to draw the graph; in this case, it’s pretty much identical

</figure>

<p>In this image, the <code>@</code> nodes represent function application. The
root node is an application of the function <code>length</code> to the graph that
represents the list <code>[1]</code>. The list itself is represented using two
application nodes: <code>(:)</code> takes two arguments, the head and tail of the
list, and function applications in Haskell are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying">curried</a>. Eventually,
in the process of evaluation, the body of <code>length</code> will be reached,
and leave us with the following graph:</p>

    <img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/haskell_lazy_evaluation/length_2.png" alt="The graph of length [1] after the body of length is expanded."> <figcaption>
            <p>The graph of <code>length [1]</code> after the body of <code>length</code> is expanded.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Conceptually, we only took one reduction step, and thus, we haven’t yet gotten
to evaluating the recursive call to <code>length</code>. Since <code>(+)</code>
is also a binary function, <code>1+length xs</code> is represented in this
new graph as two applications of <code>(+)</code>, first to <code>1</code>, and then
to <code>length []</code>.</p>
<p>But what is that box at the root? This box <em>used to be</em> the root of the
first graph, which was an application node. However, it is now a
an <em>indirection</em>. Conceptually, reducing
this indirection amounts to reducing the graph
it points to. But why have we <span>
<label for="altered-note">altered the graph</label>

<span>
<span>[note:</span>

This is a key aspect of implementing functional languages.
The language itself may be pure, while the runtime
can be, and usually is, impure and stateful. After all,
computers are impure and stateful, too!

<span>]</span>
</span>
</span>
 in this manner? Because Haskell is a pure language,
of course! If we know that a particular graph reduces to some value,
there’s no reason to reduce it again. However, as we will
soon see, it may be <em>used</em> again, so we want to preserve its value.
Thus, when we’re done reducing a graph, we replace its root node with
an indirection that points to its result.</p>
<p>When can a graph be used more than once? Well, how about this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="Haskell"><span>let</span> x <span>=</span> square <span>5</span> <span>in</span> x <span>+</span> x
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, the initial graph looks as follows:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/haskell_lazy_evaluation/square_1.png" alt="The initial graph of let x = square 5 in x + x."> <figcaption>
            <p>The initial graph of <code>let x = square 5 in x + x</code>.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As you can see, this <em>is</em> a graph, but not a tree! Since both
variables <code>x</code> refer to the same expression, <code>square 5</code>, they
are represented by the same subgraph. Then, when we evaluate <code>square 5</code>
for the first time, and replace its root node with an indirection,
we end up with the following:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/haskell_lazy_evaluation/square_2.png" alt="The graph of let x = square 5 in x + x after square 5 is reduced."> <figcaption>
            <p>The graph of <code>let x = square 5 in x + x</code> after <code>square 5</code> is reduced.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There are two <code>25</code>s in the graph, and no more <code>square</code>s! We only
had to evaluate <code>square 5</code> exactly once, even though <code>(+)</code>
will use it twice (once for the left argument, and once for the right).</p>
<p>Our graphs can also include cycles.
A simple, perhaps <em>the most</em> simple example of this in practice is Haskell’s
<code>fix</code> function. It computes a function’s fixed point,
<span>
<label for="fixpoint-note">and can be used to write recursive functions.</label>

<span>
<span>[note:</span>

In fact, in the lambda calculus, <code>fix</code> is pretty much <em>the only</em>
way to write recursive functions. In the untyped lambda calculus, it can
be written as: <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>λ</mi><mi>f</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>λ</mi><mi>x</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi><mi>f</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mtext>&nbsp;</mtext><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mtext>&nbsp;</mtext><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>λ</mi><mi>x</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi><mi>f</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mtext>&nbsp;</mtext><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda f . (\lambda x . f (x \ x)) \  (\lambda x . f (x \ x))</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>
In the simply typed lambda calculus, it cannot be written in any way, and
needs to be added as an extension, typically written as <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext mathvariant="bold">fix</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\textbf{fix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.

<span>]</span>
</span>
</span>

It’s implemented as follows:</p>

<p>See how the definition of <code>x</code> refers to itself? This is what
it looks like in graph form:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/haskell_lazy_evaluation/fixpoint_1.png" alt="The initial graph of let x = f x in x."> <figcaption>
            <p>The initial graph of <code>let x = f x in x</code>.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I think it’s useful to take a look at how this graph is processed. Let’s
pick <code>f = (1:)</code>. That is, <code>f</code> is a function that takes a list,
and prepends <code>1</code> to it. Then, after constructing the graph of <code>f x</code>,
we end up with the following:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/haskell_lazy_evaluation/fixpoint_2.png" alt="The graph of fix (1:) after it&amp;rsquo;s been reduced."> <figcaption>
            <p>The graph of <code>fix (1:)</code> after it’s been reduced.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We see the body of <code>f</code>, which is the application of <code>(:)</code> first to the
constant <code>1</code>, and then to <code>f</code>'s argument (<code>x</code>, in this case). As
before, once we evaluated <code>f x</code>, we replaced the application with
an indirection; in the image, this indirection is the top box. But the
argument, <code>x</code>, is itself an indirection which points to the root of <code>f x</code>,
thereby creating a cycle in our graph. Traversing this graph looks like
traversing an infinite list of <code>1</code>s.</p>
<p>Almost there! A node can refer to itself, and, when evaluated, it
is replaced with its own value. Thus, a node can effectively reference
its own value! The last piece of the puzzle is how a node can access
<em>parts</em> of its own value: recall that <code>doRepMax</code> calls <code>repMax</code>
with only <code>largest</code>, while <code>repMax</code> returns <code>(largest, xs')</code>.
I have to admit, I don’t know the internals of GHC, but I suspect
this is done by translating the code into something like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="Haskell"><span>doRepMax</span> <span>::</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>]
<span>doRepMax</span> xs <span>=</span> snd t
  <span>where</span> t <span>=</span> repMax xs (fst t)
</code></pre></div>
<h4 id="detailed-example-reducing-dorepmax">Detailed Example: Reducing <code>doRepMax</code>
</h4>
<p>If the above examples haven’t elucidated how <code>doRepMax</code> works,
stick around in this section and we will go through it step-by-step.
This is a rather long and detailed example, so feel free to skip
this section to read more about actually using time traveling.</p>
<p>If you’re sticking around, why don’t we watch how the graph of <code>doRepMax [1, 2]</code> unfolds.
This example will be more complex than the ones we’ve seen
so far; to avoid overwhelming ourselves with notation,
let’s adopt a different convention of writing functions. Instead
of using application nodes <code>@</code>, let’s draw an application of a
function <code>f</code> to arguments <code>x1</code> through <code>xn</code> as a subgraph with root <code>f</code>
and children <code>x</code>s. The below figure demonstrates what I mean:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/haskell_lazy_evaluation/notation.png" alt="The new visual notation used in this section."> <figcaption>
            <p>The new visual notation used in this section.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now, let’s write the initial graph for <code>doRepMax [1,2]</code>:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/haskell_lazy_evaluation/repmax_1.png" alt="The initial graph of doRepMax [1,2]."> <figcaption>
            <p>The initial graph of <code>doRepMax [1,2]</code>.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Other than our new notation, there’s nothing too surprising here.
The first step of our hypothetical reduction would replace the application of <code>doRepMax</code> with its
body, and create our graph’s first cycle. At a high level, all we want is the second …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>I was never trained in music beyond some piano lessons as a child,
but I’ve always loved strange and interesting music and sounds.
For the last few months, I’ve been assembling a collection of patch cables
and circuit boards on my desk which, when connected just right,
can create anything from melodic sequences to fast, driving beats to
wacky electronic soundscapes.</p>

<p>This is a <strong>modular synthesizer</strong> in the Eurorack format.
Eurorack is a <a href="http://www.doepfer.de/a100_man/a100t_e.htm">de-facto standard</a>
created by German synthesizer manufacturer Doepfer designed around the concept of
voltage control. Everything in Eurorack is controlled through changing voltages,
from -10 to +10 volts, representing everything: audio, pitch, speed, slope,
and even <a href="https://www.modulargrid.net/e/doepfer-a-197-3-rgb-led-controller">color</a>.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/side-shot.jpg" alt="My synthesizer shot from an “aesthetic” angle.">
</figure>

<p>As I learn more about Eurorack and the modular ecosystem, it reminds me more and more
of the magical feeling of working with UNIX tools:
it is a world that exchanges programs for filters, oscillators, and VCAs,
text for voltage, and pipes for patch cables.</p>
<h2 id="text-audio-and-control-voltage">Text, Audio, and Control Voltage</h2>
<p>We’re all used to voltage representing audio.
An “AUX cord”, correctly called a 3.5mm TRS (tip, ring, and sleeve)
stereo cable<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>,
carries two channels of voltage and a common ground between audio devices through
a nearly universal<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> standard.
For audio signals, this voltage jumps between a maximum and minimum voltage.
Its value over time is eventually turned into the movement of a speaker or
headphone diaphragm, which in turn moves the air and can be heard.</p>
<p>In modular synthesis, though, we don’t just use these analog signals to represent the
movements of air that our ears hear as audio.
We also use them to control other parameters: pitch, for example.
Like the text streams that we use to move data around in UNIX tools,
or the JSON payloads that power a huge portion of the modern web,
voltage-based communication is simple but versatile.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/control-voltage.jpg" alt="A module in my synthesizer displaying the changes in control voltage representingpitch"></p>
<p>The micro-Ornament and Crime module displaying changing pitch values,
as represented by the voltage coming into its CV1 input.</p>

</figure>

<p>These voltages are, by their nature, analog -
there are infinitely many values between C4 and D4, or even between C4 and C#4.
Among other things, this means that complex microtonal music is not just possible,
but just as easy for the hardware to produce as music in any Western scale.</p>
<p>Text, of course, isn’t analog, but it does have similar characteristics.
It’s not always easy to parse or generate exactly the right text,
but with enough information, it’s always possible to interoperate with something
that uses a text interface, or even JSON structured data.</p>
<h2 id="oscillators-filters-grep-and-awk">Oscillators, Filters, <code>grep</code>, and <code>awk</code></h2>
<p>The traditional synthesizer, as invented by Bob Moog and co., produces sound
through a so-called <strong>subtractive</strong> process.
Sound, some kind of complex wave-form, is produced by an <strong>oscillator</strong>,
according to control voltage representing pitch.
That waveform, which has lots of harmonics, is put through an amplifier
which turns the sound on when a note is being played, and off when it is not,
and through a filter, which removes some harmonics and emphasizes others.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/threshold.jpg" alt="A Threshold module, outside of the synthesizer."></p>
<p>Just one module, removed from my synthesizer.
This is a four-oscillator retro digital voice, which produces three channels of
square waves and one “complex” waveform (noise, stepped triangle, etc.)</p>
<p>Each voice has four voltage inputs and one output, along with two buttons
and two knobs. The module also provides a “mixed” output.</p>

</figure>

<p>Of course, this is not so different from a standard UNIX log mangling pipeline,
where <code>cat</code> grabs some output from a file, <code>awk</code> formats it in some easy-to-work-with
way, <code>grep</code> cuts out irrelevant information, and <code>head</code>, <code>tail</code>, or a second <code>awk</code>
invocation formats the output.
This is the versatility of universal, standard interfaces like text, JSON, or voltage;
each tool does what it does, and interoperates cleanly.</p>
<h2 id="envelopes-signal-flow-and-mkfifo">Envelopes, Signal Flow, and <code>mkfifo</code></h2>
<p>In my rack, I have a simple signal flow mapped out by the sequence of modules.
My <a href="https://winterbloom.com/store/winterbloom-sol">Winterbloom Sol</a> turns digital
signals into control voltage.
The <a href="https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/kinks/">Kinks</a>,
<a href="https://pushermanproductions.com/product/jakplugg-open-source-pique-4hp-peaks-pcb-fr4-panel/">Pique</a>
and <a href="https://ornament-and-cri.me/">Ornament and Crime</a> modules shape that CV.
Then come two oscillators, a filter, a set of amplifiers, and some effects.</p>
<p>But that’s not necessarily the order I actually patch the signal chain.</p>
<p>Most synths have an “envelope” control, sometimes controlling the level of a signal,
and sometimes controlling a filter.
The magic of modular is that each of those components is discrete.
One module generates control voltage every time a note is played.
Another module (a <strong>voltage controlled amplifier</strong> or VCA) uses that control voltage
to change the volume of the note,
turning a rising voltage into attack and falling voltage into decay.
A third  module (a <strong>voltage controlled filter</strong>) uses that control voltage to change
the harmonic content of the sound. Just by moving a cable from the “FM” input to the
“Q” input, that filter can go from subtracting harmonics to emphasizing them,
or maybe both!</p>
<p>This is the flexibility of modular synthesis.
Every signal exists within a constrained realm, and every module manufacturer
knows what their interface should expect.
Each module does some transformation - in a sense, every module represents
a mathematical funtion, transforming voltage-over-time and knob positions
into voltage-over-time, which can itself be transformed by further modules.</p>
<p>This is not necessarily something we see often in UNIX programming -
but it is possible!
With <code>mkfifo</code>, we can create more complex data flows and unique ways of moving
information around, using multiple FIFOs as input and output files.
In web systems, this kind of many-way connection is very common;
even relatively simple systems like If This Then That allow users to create
long, wide, branching data flows, and even flows that contain cycles.
Ideally, each program or API does work like a mathematical function,
taking command line arguments and input and transforming them into
output and perhaps some side effects, like making a Mastodon post or
writing to disk or a database.</p>
<h2 id="modularity-open-source-and-market-forces">Modularity, Open Source, and Market Forces</h2>
<p>In the forward to  <em>The UNIX Time-Sharing System</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>,
the seminal 1978 paper on UNIX, Doug McIlroy articulates the philosophy of modularity
thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh.</li>
<li>Expect the output of every program to become the input of another, unknown,
program.</li>
<li>Design and build software […] to be tried early, ideally within weeks. <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>These are the same values that motivate the design of the best Eurorack modules.
Each module is easy to experiment with, designed to accomplish one or a few tasks,
explicitly built to integrate with other modules, and well-documented.</p>
<p>Eurorack’s modularity works well because there is no incentive to lock in users -
indeed, there is a significant disincentive, since no one small company
could ever hope to produce a universal product line.
Building modules that work well in as many systems as possible is the best way
to maximize sales.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/front-shot.jpg" alt="A front-on shot of my case, along with my Beatstep Pro controller"></p>
<p>My whole synthesizer is controlled by this Beatstep Pro, and optionally by Linux
software like 100r ORCA.</p>

</figure>

<p>Indeed, even in the cases where larger companies (like Intellijel) have tried to
invent their own standards to get at least some degree of lock-in revenue,
the size of the market limits the effectiveness of that strategy.
Their smaller, 1U form factor has been widely adopted, and there are now nearly
a dozen small manufacturers making compatible modules.</p>
<p>We, as software engineers, should strive to build software that is amenable to
interoperability, because that is the most effective way to support creativity.
Documented, open, and capable APIs are good, if your software must be centralized;
federation through open protocols is even better.</p>
<p>Critically, your interface does not need to be optimal.
Control voltage in 1v/Oct certainly isn’t; it requires difficult and imprecise
exponential conversion circuits, or slow and expensive floating point computations.
Consider, for instance, ActivityPub and the Mastodon ecosystem.
Eugen Rochko could have easily stuck with OStatus, which does have some advantages,
but the Mastodon project’s move to ActivityPub catalzyed an entire ecosystem,
with dozens of other microblogging products, as well as blogs, video sharing,
music sharing, and photo sharing software springing up, all able to interoperate
at least somewhat.</p>
<p>Modularity also promotes longevity.
The predecessor to <code>ls</code> was written in 1961<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>; the GNU <code>find</code> command has
history as far back as 1987<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. These programs are so deeply embedded in the brain
stem of computing that building a modern server operating system without something
compatible is nearly unthinkable.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/open-source.jpg" alt="Another side shot of my synthesizer."></p>
<p>Every module in this photograph is open source - software and hardware.</p>

</figure>

<p>I should also point out that, while free and open source software is,
in my opinion, a moral good,
software freedom and open protocols/interfaces are tangential concerns.
While many Eurorack modules are open source, some of the most popular are not;
for example, Make Noise’s analog computer Maths is not an open source design,
but it is the heart of many modular systems because it integrates well into
the ecosystem and has a clearly documented and well-specified interface.</p>
<p>Amazon’s Simple Storage Service, for instance, is a proprietary service with an open
protocol, and it is hugely successful - so much so that many projects have sprung up
to implement its interface, and a huge volume of cloud software is designed to work
with “S3 - and other stuff that works the same.”</p>
<p>Modularity is the most direct path to innovation. As software engineers,
we should do our absolute best, both technically and politically, to build
programs that do one thing well,
programs that can be tried early,
and programs that work well together.
Anything else guarantees stagnation, lock-in, frustration, and eventual obscurity.</p>

				<p>This guide describes how to tune your AMD64/x86_64 hardware and Linux system for
running real-time or low latency workloads. Example workloads where this type of
tuning would be appropriate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Line rate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_analyzer">packet capture</a></li>
<li>Line rate
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_packet_inspection">deep packet inspection (DPI)</a></li>
<li>Applications using kernel-bypass networking</li>
<li>Accurate benchmarking of
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/868568/what-do-the-terms-cpu-bound-and-i-o-bound-mean">CPU bound</a>
programs</li>
</ul>
<p>The term latency in this context refers to the time between receiving some event
and the time when the event was processed. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The time between a network packet was received by a NIC until an application
finished processing the packet.</li>
<li>The time between a request was submitted to a queue and the worker thread
finished processing the request.</li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve low latency this guide describes how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maximize per core performance by maximizing CPU frequency and disabling
power saving features.</li>
<li>Minimize jitter caused by interrupts, timers and other applications
interfering with your workload.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can measure the reduced system jitter using my tool
<a href="https://github.com/rigtorp/hiccups">hiccups</a>. In this example it shows how core
3 was isolated and experienced a maximum jitter of 18 us:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ hiccups | column -t -R 1,2,3,4,5,6
cpu  threshold_ns  hiccups  pct99_ns  pct999_ns    max_ns
  0           168    17110     83697    6590444  17010845
  1           168     9929    169555    5787333   9517076
  2           168    20728     73359    6008866  16008460
  3           168    28336      1354       4870     17869

<h2 id="hardware-tuning">Hardware tuning</h2>
<h3 id="enable-performance-mode">Enable performance mode</h3>
<p>The systems UEFI or BIOS usually have a setting for energy profile that adjusts
available CPU power states, you should set this to “maximum performance” or
equivalent.</p>
<h3 id="disable-hyper-threading">Disable hyper-threading</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-threading">Hyper-threading (HT)</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-threading">Simultaneous multithreading (SMT)</a>
is a technology to maximize processor resource usage for workloads with low
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructions_per_cycle">instructions per cycle (IPC)</a>.
Since HT/SMT increases contention on processor resources it’s recommended to
turn it off if you want to reduce jitter introduced by contention on processor
resources. Disabling HT/SMT has the additional benefit of doubling (in case of
2-way SMT) the effective L1 and L2 cache available to a thread.</p>
<p>HT/SMT can be turned off in your system’s UEFI or BIOS firmware settings.</p>
<h3 id="enable-turbo-boost">Enable Turbo Boost</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Turbo_Boost">Intel Turbo Boost</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_Turbo_Core">AMD Turbo Core</a> technologies
allows the processor to automatically overclock itself as long as it stays
within some power and thermal envelope. If you have good cooling (set fan speed
to max in BIOS), disable unused cores in BIOS or using the CPU hotplug
functionality it’s possible to run your application cores continuously at the
higher boost frequency.</p>
<p>Check if turbo boost is enabled:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo
</code></pre><p>Output should be 0 if turbo boost is enabled.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can use <code>cpupower</code> to check the status of turbo boost:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">cpupower frequency-info
</code></pre><p>Use the <code>turbostat</code> tool to verify the clock frequency of each core. Note that
<code>turbostat</code> will cause scheduling jitter and should not be used during
production.</p>

<h3 id="overclocking">Overclocking</h3>
<p>Consider overclocking your processors. Running your processor at higher
frequency will reduce jitter and latency. It’s not possible to overclock Intel
Xeon server processors, but you can overclock Intel’s consumer gaming processors
and AMD’s processors.</p>

<h3 id="isolate-cores">Isolate cores</h3>
<p>By default the kernel scheduler will load balance all threads across all
available cores. To stop system threads from interfering with your application
threads from you can use the kernel command line option <code>isolcpus</code>. It disables
scheduler load balancing for the isolated cores and causes threads to be
restricted to the non-isolated cores by default. Note that your critical
application threads needs to be specifically pinned to the isolated cores in
order to run there.</p>
<p>For example to isolate cores 1 through 7 add <code>isolcpus=1-7</code> to your kernel
command line.</p>
<p>When using isolcpus the kernel will still create several kernel threads on the
isolated cores. Some of these kernel threads can be moved to the non-isolated
cores.</p>
<p>Try to move all kernel threads to core 0:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># pgrep -P 2 | xargs -i taskset -p -c 0 {}
</code></pre><p>Alternatively use <code>tuna</code> move all kernel threads away from cores 1-7:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># tuna --cpus=1-7 --isolate
</code></pre><p>Verify by using the <code>tuna</code> command to show CPU affinities for all threads:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">tuna -P
</code></pre><p>Additionally kernel workqueues needs to be moved away from isolated cores. To
move all work queues to core 0 (cpumask 0x1):</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># find /sys/devices/virtual/workqueue -name cpumask  -exec sh -c 'echo 1 &gt; {}' ';'
</code></pre><p>Verify by listing current workqueue affinities:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">find /sys/devices/virtual/workqueue -name cpumask -print -exec cat '{}' ';'
</code></pre><p>Finally verify if cores were successfully isolated by checking how many thread
context switches are occurring per core:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># perf stat -e 'sched:sched_switch' -a -A --timeout 10000
</code></pre><p>The isolated cores should show a very low context switch count.</p>
<p>There is a work in progress patch set to improve task isolation even further,
see
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/816298/">A full task-isolation mode for the kernel</a>.</p>

<h3 id="reducing-timer-tick-interrupts">Reducing timer tick interrupts</h3>
<p>The scheduler runs regularly on each core in order to switch between runnable
threads. This will introduce jitter for latency critical applications. If you
have isolated your application cores and are running a single application thread
per isolated core you can use the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.html?highlight=nohz_full"><code>nohz_full</code></a> kernel command line option
in order to suppress the timer interrupts.</p>
<p>For example to enable <code>nohz_full</code> on cores 1-7 add <code>nohz_full=1-7 rcu_nocbs=1-7</code>
to your kernel command line.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that the timer tick is only disabled on a core when there
is only a single runnable thread scheduled on that core. You can see the number
of runnable threads per core in <em>/proc/sched_debug</em>.</p>
<p>The virtual memory subsystem runs a per core statistics update task every 1
second by default. You can reduce this interval by setting <code>vm.stat_interval</code> to
a higher value, for example 120 seconds:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># sysctl vm.stat_interval=120
</code></pre><p>Finally you can verify that the timer interrupt frequency is reduced by
inspecting <em>/proc/interrupts</em> or using <a href="https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page"><em>perf</em></a> to monitor timer
interrupts:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># perf stat -e 'irq_vectors:local_timer_entry' -a -A --timeout 30000

 Performance counter stats for 'system wide':

CPU0                   31,204      irq_vectors:local_timer_entry
CPU1                    3,771      irq_vectors:local_timer_entry
CPU2                        3      irq_vectors:local_timer_entry
CPU3                        4      irq_vectors:local_timer_entry

      30.001671482 seconds time elapsed
</code></pre><p>In the above example cores 2 and 3 has a reduced timer interrupt frequency.
Expect <code>isolcpus</code> + <code>nohz_full</code> cores to show a timer interrupt every other
second or so. Unfortunately the timer tick cannot be completely eliminated.</p>

<h3 id="interrupt-affinity">Interrupt affinity</h3>
<p>Reduce jitter from interrupt processing by changing the CPU affinity of the
interrupts. This can easily be done by running
<a href="https://github.com/Irqbalance/irqbalance"><em>irqbalance</em></a>. By default
<em>irqbalance</em> will automatically isolate the cores specified by the kernel
command line parameter <code>isolcpus</code>. You can also specify cores to isolate using
the <code>IRQBALANCE_BANNED_CPUS</code> environment variable.</p>
<p>To isolate cores specified in <code>isolcpus</code>:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">irqbalance --foreground --oneshot
</code></pre><p>To isolate core 3 (hexadecimal bitmask 0x8):</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">IRQBALANCE_BANNED_CPUS=8 irqbalance --foreground --oneshot
</code></pre><p>List CPU affinity for all IRQs:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">find /proc/irq/ -name smp_affinity_list -print -exec cat '{}' ';'
</code></pre><p>Finally verify that isolated cores are not receiving interrupts by monitoring
<em>/proc/interrupts</em>:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">watch cat /proc/interrupts
</code></pre><p>References:</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="network-stack-tuning">Network stack tuning</h3>
<p>For low latency networking I don’t recommend using the Linux kernel networking
stack. Instead I recommend using kernel bypass technologies such as
<a href="https://www.dpdk.org/">DPDK</a>, <a href="https://www.openonload.org/">OpenOnload</a>,
<a href="https://www.mellanox.com/products/software/accelerator-software/vma?mtag=vma">Mellanox VMA</a>
or <a href="https://exablaze.com/">Exablaze</a>. If you are using the kernel networking
stack there are several options you can use to tune it for low latency. I
suggest reading the
<a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/performance_tuning_guide/sect-red_hat_enterprise_linux-performance_tuning_guide-networking-configuration_tools">Red Hat Enterprise Linux Performance Tuning Guide</a>
and the blog post
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-to-achieve-low-latency/">“How to achieve low latency with 10Gbps Ethernet”</a>
to learn about these options.</p>
<h3 id="disable-swap">Disable swap</h3>
<p>Accessing anonymous memory that has been swapped out to disk will incur a major
page fault. You can prevent this by disabling swap:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">swapoff -a
</code></pre><p>Your application will still incur major page faults when accessing <em>file backed
memory mappings</em> …</p></div></div>

<p>What this function does is to give you a <em>lumninance-correct</em> grayscale version of any matplotlib colormap.
I've found this useful for quickly checking how my plots might appear if printed in black and white, but I think it's probably even more useful for stoking the flame of the internet's general rant against <em>jet</em>.</p>

<p>If you want to take a step toward joining the in-crowd of chromatically-sensitive data viz geeks, your best bet is to start by bashing <em>jet</em>. Even if you don't know it by name, I can guarantee that if you've read many scientific papers, you've seen jet before. For example, here's a snapshot of a plot from neuroscience journal which is skewered by an <a href="https://abandonmatlab.wordpress.com/2011/05/07/lets-talk-colormaps/">appropriately ranty blogpost</a> on the subject:</p>
<p><img src="http://jakevdp.github.io/figures/jet.png"></p>
<p>Jet is the default colorbar originally used by matlab, and this default was inherited in the early days of Python's <code>matplotlib</code> package. The reasons not to use jet are numerous, and you can find good arguments against it across the web. For some more subdued and nuanced arguments, I'd start with the paper <a href="http://www.jwave.vt.edu/~rkriz/Projects/create_color_table/color_07.pdf">Rainbow Color Map (Still) Considered Harmful</a> and, for more general visualization tips, <a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1003833">Ten Simple Rules for Better Figures</a>.</p>
<p>So what do I have to add to this discussion that hasn't been already said? Well, nothing really, except the code snippet I shared above. Let me show you what it does.</p>

<p>We'll use matplotlib's <code>imshow</code> command to visualize this.
By default, it will use the <code>"jet"</code> colormap:</p>

<p>At first glance this might look OK. But upon closer examination, you might notice that jet's <em>Luminance profile</em> is incredibly complicated.
Because your eye has different levels of sensitivity to light of different color, the luminance is not simply the sum of the RGB values as you might naively expect, but some weighted Euclidean sum of the individual values. You can find more information than you'd ever need to know on <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/color_mods/#grayscale">imagemagick's website</a>.</p>

<p>It's a mess! The greyscale-only version of this colormap has strange luminance spikes in the middle, and makes it incredibly difficult to figure out what's going on in a plot with a modicum of complexity. Much better is to use a colormap with a uniform luminance gradient, such as the built-in grayscale colormap. Let's plot this beside the previous two:</p>

<p>There are some colormaps in here that have very nice, linear luminance gradients, and this is something you should keep in mind when choosing your color map.</p>
<p>Much more could be written about choosing an appropriate color map for any given data; for a more in-depth discussion of matplotlib's maps (and some interesting luminance illustrations), you can refer to matplotlib's <a href="http://matplotlib.org/users/colormaps.html">choosing a colormap</a> documentation.</p>
<p>If you're interested in streamlined statistical plotting in Python with well thought-out default color choices, I'd suggest taking a look at Michael Waskom's <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/">seaborn</a> project, and especially the associated <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/tutorial/color_palettes.html">Color Palette Tutorial</a>.</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Protocol Buffer, also known as Protobuf, is Google’s language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. It has been widely used in many applications, such as TensorFlow and <a href="https://grpc.io/">gRPC</a>. We have actually been using it without being aware, thus it has become a black box to most of the users.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I am going to give a short tutorial on how to use Protocol Buffer in C++.</p>

<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>

<p>Protobuf compiler and libraries could be installed via <code>apt</code> on Ubuntu. However, to use the latest version of protobuf, we install from source code.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>cd</span> /tmp
<span>$ </span>wget https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v3.8.0/protobuf-all-3.8.0.tar.gz
<span>$ </span><span>tar</span> <span>-xf</span> protobuf-all-3.8.0.tar.gz
<span>$ </span><span>cd </span>protobuf-3.8.0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I chose to install the <code>all</code> version so it would be a little bit slow. To accelerate the installation process., we take advantage of multi-threads.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>./configure
<span>$ </span>make <span>-j16</span>
<span>$ </span>make check <span>-j16</span> <span># Make sure the installation would not have problems</span>
<span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>make <span>install</span>
<span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>ldconfig <span># Refresh shared library cache.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Protocol Buffer libraries would be installed to <code>/usr/local/lib</code> by default.</p>



<p>To verify protobuf has been installed successfully.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>protoc <span>--version</span>
libprotoc 3.8.0
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="tutorial">Tutorial</h3>

<p>To learn Protocol Buffer, the most intuitive way is to go to the Google Protocol Buffer official website and start its official tutorial. However, the official <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/cpptutorial">tutorials</a> on the Google protobuf website are still using programming standard Proto2 while the latest programming standard is Proto3 which was released in 2016. The official <a href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/tree/master/examples">samples</a> are using Proto3 and CMake, however, its CMake is not standard and many of its macros were not documented on the official CMake website. Therefore, I re-implemented Google’s official Protobuf C++ example using Proto3 and CMake with the best practice in a way that users are most likely to run into.</p>



<p>The source code could be found on my GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/leimao/Protocol_Buffer_Examples">Protocol Buffer Examples</a>.</p>



<p>The protobuf <code>proto</code> file, C++ <code>cc</code> file, and CMake <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> files should be self-explanatory since I have put a lot of comments in the code to make it human-readable and easy to understand.</p>

<h3 id="basic-protocol">Basic Protocol</h3>

<p>To summarize the basic protocol of programming using protobuf:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Define the structure of the data in a <code>proto</code> file.</li>
  <li>Implement the C++ programs which serialize/de-serialize the structured data. The programs will use the header and source code files of the structured data generated by the protobuf compiler. Alternatively, the program will use the header file generated by the protobuf compiler and the static library of the structured data generated by the C++ compiler.</li>
  <li>Write CMake compile system to generate the header and source code files of the structured data, static library of the structured data, and the executable files.</li>
</ol>

Across 15 interviews, the problem most consistently mentioned was the inability to set weekly goals eg. &nbsp;"Work out 4X per week". Other habit apps had the feature, and it aligned with our intuition. So we built it 🎉.</p><figure><img src="https://snaphabit.app/blog/content/images/2020/08/IMG_BE540AC0130B-1-1.png"><figcaption>Ah, problem solved.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Getting my head around the choice between sleeping and 'tickers'</h2>

	<p><small>August  1, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>If you have a program that wants to do something periodically, say
once every ten seconds, the obvious and simplest way is to just
sleep for ten seconds after each time you do the thing. For example:</p>


<blockquote><pre>while True:
  collect_device_stats()
  publish_device_stats()
  time.sleep(10)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Some languages and libraries also offer an API that I've seen called
a 'ticker'; Go, for example, has <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Ticker"><code>time.Ticker</code></a>. A ticker signals or invokes
you somehow every time interval, such as every ten seconds. With
a ticker, you could write the above (in Go) as something like:</p>

<blockquote><pre>ticker := time.NewTicker(10*time.Second)
for {
  t := &lt;- ticker.C
  collect_device_stats(t)
  publish_device_stats(t)
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The big difference between the two is that <strong>a ticker is indifferent
to how long it took you to do your work</strong>. If collecting and
publishing device stats takes two seconds, the sleep approach means
that you will do this once every twelve seconds (two seconds for
the work followed by ten seconds of sleeping). The ticker approach
will collect and publish once every ten seconds, because it signals
you every ten seconds even if it took you two seconds to collect
and publish device stats.</p>

<p>While this may make tickers sound great, this behavior has potential
downsides. Which one you want depends partly on what your reasons are
for sleeping or delaying. In particular, if you're sleeping to limit
the load your actions create, then a ticker may not be what you want,
precisely because it's indifferent to how long your work took. If your
work takes nine seconds and you sleep afterward for ten, you're keeping
things less than 50% busy. If your work takes nine seconds and you have
a ten second ticker, you're keeping things 90% busy; one second after
you finish your work the ticker will go off again and start it all over.</p>

<p>Tickers are great for things you want to happen every N seconds,
even if they take a bunch of time (or a variable amount of time).
Sleeping is great for things you want to happen no more often than
once every N seconds. However, the difference between the two only
matters if what you're doing does (or may) take an appreciable
amount of time compared to the tick (or sleep) interval; if it isn't
going to, you might as well use whichever API is more idiomatic and
convenient, although tickers will probably make things more regular
and precise.</p>

<p>(This set of thoughts was sparked by poking around in <a href="https://gitlab.com/shouptech/cyberpower_exporter">some Python
code</a> that used
the <code>sleep()</code> idiom and then thinking about how it would probably
use a ticker in Go. (Well, in Go it would have a better API for what
it's doing, but apart from that.))</p>

<p>After I published my post pointing out the <a href="https://oonwoye.com/2020/07/06/diversity-and-big-tech-media/?swcfpc=1">hypocrisy of Big Tech Media in the diversity in tech debate</a>, I got a few grunts of acknowledgement from a couple of the publications covered. Afterwards, these journalists sat on what was surely a newsworthy story. Why? I don’t know.</p>



<p><a href="https://oonwoye.com/2020/07/15/big-tech-media-colluding/">Outside of journalists banding together in silence</a>, the post was well-received, but deep inside, I sensed people wanted a data size larger than just five Big Tech Media publications which I had used. So here is a more comprehensive data bank of 982 individuals across 14 publications. It’s a collaboration between myself and<a href="https://twitter.com/balajis"> Balaji</a>. It includes an estimated race and gender breakdown of those that determine what we read about tech, along with the code snippets used in collating the data as well as the raw data itself.</p>



<p><a href="https://tech-journalism-diversity-report.github.io/code/">Read the study, it includes code samples.</a></p>



<p>Since Big Tech Media hasn’t published an official diversity report of their organizations, the study was done using publicly available information on Twitter and cross-checked with Twitter lists of tech journalists. It uses a few different methods for data collection, and a few different methods to determine race and gender, and gets similar results each time. The data set is open source, so if there are any errors please submit a correction. <strong>However, the best bet would be for each tech media corporation to follow the lead of tech companies and release a public diversity report.</strong></p>



<p>Highlight of the results:</p>



<ul><li>Big Tech Media is ~ 80% White</li><li>Big Tech is ~51% White </li></ul>



<p>Again, you should take a moment and read it: <a href="https://techjournalismislessdiversethantech.com/">https://techjournalismislessdiversethantech.com</a>.</p>







<p><strong>Big Tech Media corporations should do the right thing and release the demographic breakdown of their employee base. There is even a federal requirement to file the </strong><a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/employers/eeo-1-survey"><strong>form EEO-1 Survey</strong></a><strong> which breaks this data down.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Let’s start with some history.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BPG (Better Portable Graphics) is a new image format with the purpose to replace JPEG image format when quality or file size is an issue.</p>
<ul>
<li>By Fabrice Bellard</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that BPG not only is way smaller than JPEG but also delivers a better quality. And that’s not all! It also supports animations!</p>
<p>And when I say animation, I actually say GIF-like movies with MP4 quality that are actually smaller than the mp4 it was built from.</p>
<p>Let’s see an example (I have not included a GIF example because the same quality size and frame rate means that the GIF will have exactly 33.8MB)</p>
<p>So let’s go:</p>
<p>
<video id="ambition-mp4" loop="">
<source src="https://eek.ro/assets/bpg/preview-ambition-no-audio.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<br>mp4, 25fps, 927kb
</p>

<p>
<img id="ambition-bpg" alt="Ambition BPG" src="https://eek.ro/assets/bpg/ambition.bpg">
<br>bpg, 25fps, 518kb
</p>


<p>The movie is called <a href="https://fnd.ie/vid/BJ3B">Ambition</a> and you can view it on <a href="https://fnd.ie/vid/BJ3B">Findie</a>.</p>
<h3 id="spot-the-differences-">Spot the differences? :)</h3>
<ul>
<li>There’s none (the mp4 doesn’t include audio, and neither does the BPG.)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="advantages">Advantages?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Animation support.</strong> You can have a GIF half the size of an MP4.</li>
<li><strong>Video inline play</strong> (but without sound). One of the biggest problems is that on Mobile Safari no video can be played inline. GIFs solve, and when we have GIFs that are 5% the size of the original, that’s epic!</li>
<li><strong>High compression ratio.</strong> Smaller than a JPG and even smaller than Google’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/">WebP</a> with similar quality if not better.</li>
<li><strong>You can start using today</strong> with a Javascript decoder (gzipped size: 56 KB).</li>
<li><strong>And plenty other</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>GIFs today are not even GIFs anymore. With the release of Imgur’s <a href="https://imgur.com/blog/2014/10/09/introducing-gifv/">gifv</a> the internet went nuts for nothing more than a mp4 that has autoplay, and if mp4’s are not supported, or autoplay is disabled (mobiles), they’re replaced with very low quality GIFs.</p>
<h3 id="downsides">Downsides?</h3>
<p>We got just a few…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decompiling time!</strong> - Current example is around 8-10s (the bigger the file, the slower the decompiling)… This would be easily solved if browsers would add native support.</li>
<li><strong>Main thread blocking</strong> while decompiling large files.</li>
<li><strong>No sound support</strong> (but who cares, this is image encoding, we’re not talking better video formats).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="so-what-can-we-do">So what can we do?</h3>
<p>Why not go ahead and promote it so that browsers actually support it. Or you can start using it today, it requires some CPU processing, but hey! We’re saving bandwidth! :D</p>
<p>For example there’s a feature request on the Bugzilla Tracker of Firefox - <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1111277">here</a></p>
<p>Or share this article if you liked it! :D</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>It was a rollercoaster of a week. It began when <a href="https://bbirnbaum.com/two-lessons-on-reducing-sign-up-friction/">an article</a> I wrote about my side project, which I’d been quietly building for seven months, unexpectedly made it to the number two spot on Hacker News. It ended with me considering whether I should give up on the project completely.</p><p>The side project is called <a href="https://cortadomail.com/">Cortado</a>. It’s a website that gives users control over their information intake by letting them create a customized daily email from sources like Twitter, Reddit, RSS feeds, Hacker News, and more.</p><p>Over the course of 24 hours, ten thousand people read my article. About one hundred of them clicked through to Cortado’s landing page and signed up. My user base grew from a handful of family and friends to more than a hundred strangers from across the world. These new users were giving me great feedback, saying nice things about the service, and sharing helpful criticism.</p><p>I was thrilled that something that I made for myself, something that I wasn’t sure anyone else would want, seemed to be solving a real problem for other people. I couldn’t wait to improve the product and grow my user base more.</p><p>But my excitement didn’t last long. The next day I noticed an email from a service called Mailbrew in my inbox. I didn’t give it much thought because I didn’t remember signing up for a something of that name. I assumed the email was spam and archived it. But the following day I got another email from Mailbrew, and this time I opened it.</p><p>It was a digest of sources from Twitter, Reddit, and RSS feeds about entrepreneurship. It felt familiar.</p><p>I clicked through to mailbrew.com and found a product just like Cortado. Even the copy on the landing page was similar. The term “information diet” was prominently displayed, and the two projects shared a coffee-inspired name.</p><p>But Mailbrew was much further along. It had more features, better-formatted emails, and wider visibility. I was really impressed by what the creators had accomplished.</p><p>My first thought, however irrational, was that Mailbrew must have been inspired by Cortado. Of course that was impossible -- it couldn’t have been so far along if that were the case -- but the idea was just so similar. Soon, however, I realized that the creators had launched their product quite visibly months earlier. In fact, the reason their email showed up in my inbox in the first place was that I had previously subscribed to a product built by them called Unreadit, which had morphed into Mailbrew after the launch.</p><p>I had already been working on Cortado for months before Mailbrew launched, but my progress had been slow (I have a full-time job and two small kids), and I hadn’t yet gotten any users apart from family and friends.</p><p>So it looked like I was the copycat.</p><p>I was bummed. Here I was, poised to double down on my side project and turn it into something bigger, fresh off of an unanticipated burst of validation, when I found out that not only did I have a formidable competitor, but also that I was the unwitting imitator.</p><p>Of course, there’s nothing wrong with seeing a good product and trying to improve on it, but it’s nice to at least know what you’re getting into up front. If I had known about Mailbrew before I started, I might have just signed up for it instead of investing hundreds of hours building my own product.</p><p>I considered my options: I could stop working on Cortado completely, I could find a way to pivot the product to distinguish it from Mailbrew, or I could simply press on, continuing to improve Cortado and grow its user base.</p><p>My first instinct was to stop. I wasn’t that interested in competition, especially when I was second to market. I couldn’t see how I could ever catch up to Mailbrew given my time constraints. But after some thought, I realized I wasn’t ready to stop. I couldn’t give it up just days after I had gotten my first real users, many of whom were telling me how much they liked it.</p><p>Next, I thought more about pivoting. But I was already building the product that I wanted, the one that was solving my own problem and that was apparently also solving a problem experienced by others. A pivot immediately after this positive feedback didn’t feel right.</p><p>So finally I decided to continue with Cortado, focusing on building the best product that I could for my users. Cortado would of course continue to evolve as I got more feedback, but any pivots would be based on what users were telling me instead of on what another product was doing.</p><p>That was two months ago. Since then, I’ve talked to a number of users and worked to address their feedback. Some people I've talked to have also used Mailbrew, and I've learned that one of Cortado's main selling points is simply that it’s free. So that’s at least one concrete difference between Cortado and Mailbrew. We’ll see what others develop.</p><p>The truth is I don’t yet have full clarity on what distinguishes Cortado from Mailbrew. I do know that I don’t want to stop building and growing Cortado, that there’s plenty that I can still learn from this project, and that it can’t hurt for users to have more choice.</p><p>Six months from now, I expect it will be more clear what makes Cortado unique. But the way I will get there will not be by focusing on a competitor. It will be from talking to users, responding to their feedback, and building the best product that I can.</p><hr><p><em>Thanks to Yaw Anokwa, Josh Haimson, and Jenny Klein for providing feedback on drafts of this post.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>For a beginner, it is not an easy task to understand Docker. I will admit that I have struggled with using and understanding containers for a long time and I still have a lot to work on. There is a ton of subtleties that goes into solidly grasping the concepts behind Docker, why it is so revolutionary, and why even a budding programmer might benefit from learning it and using it.</p>
<p><img src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/f9Rrghj6TDckb5nZZR/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47kyxuoduhgc2jfofwhix1gvnhxbp4spk29x3p5r0g&amp;rid=giphy.gif" alt="It is amazing"></p>
<p>This is my humble attempt to channel hours and hours of headaches, despair, and a-ha! moments into a beginner-friendly, digestible format. This is the first in a series of articles, and I hope it will give you a headstart in your Docker journey!</p>
<h2 id="some-history">Some history</h2>
<p>The typical way of writing software was simple. A developer works on his local machine, installing a bunch of packages, setting up the environment, etc. Once the necessary code was in good shape, our dev friend shares the code to the ops folks, and... it doesn't work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ops:</strong> Your code doesn't work.</p>
<p><strong>Dev:</strong> Hey it worked on my machine!</p>
<p><strong>Ops:</strong> What version of <code>XXX</code> do you run?</p>
<p><strong>Dev:</strong> I have no idea, man...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can imagine, a very long time was spent troubleshooting dev environments instead of shipping features and improvements.</p>
<p>The solution found was in <strong>hypervisors </strong>and <strong>Virtual Machines (VMs)</strong>. With VMs, you can package and ship a fully configured operating system along with your code, and spin up as many development and test environments as you see fit with it. Coding becomes just booting up a VM, configuring the environments as you need them, develop software, test it, and your job is done! But how does all of this work? What are VMs? Let's look at the architecture of a computer running VMs.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596313897133/V0-9594IP.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Types of VM"></p>
<p>There are a lot of terms that you might not know, so let's go through them. The <strong>infrastructure</strong> is the computer hardware, meaning CPU, RAM, SSDs and hard disks, motherboards, and anything else is part of the physical components of the host machine. The <strong>Host OS</strong> is the operating system that is installed on the infrastructure. As an example, if you were to purchase a MacBook, the aluminum shell and all the components are part of the infrastructure, while MacOS is the Host Os.</p>
<p>The <strong>hypervisor</strong> is a piece of software that handles the creation of Virtual Machines. Each of these VMs can run their independent process, as they believe they are using the hardware resources from the infrastructure. In reality, the hypervisor allocates hardware from the pool of resources that the infrastructure makes available. In simplest terms, it creates a virtual representation of portions of the Host Machine hardware and lets Virtual Machine run on those, managing the resources.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596306270830/a10Buy6vP.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="How does a hypervisor work?"></p>
<p>As you can see from the diagram, are two types of hypervisors, depending on where they sit in the system architecture. </p>
<h4 id="bare-metal-hypervisors-type-1-">Bare-Metal Hypervisors (Type 1):</h4>
<p>The hypervisor software is installed directly on the hardware and embedded in its components. In this case, there is no Host OS on these infrastructures. These are the most common type of hypervisors used in production environments, as they are more secure and have a higher performance by being so close to the machine level.</p>
<h4 id="hosted-hypervisors-type-2-">Hosted Hypervisors (Type 2):</h4>
<p>The hypervisor software is installed on an operating system. If you have played with VMs, this is most likely the type of hypervisor that you have used. Simply think of Oracle VirtualBox, Parallels Desktop, VMWare Fusion, or any of the major VM providers.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596309047453/pww4mOHmh.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Bare-metal vs Hosted Hypervisors"></p>
<p>The important point to note here is that, while a hypervisor provides all the resources and virtualized hardware, it does not provide an operating system. This is where the <strong>Guest OS</strong> plays its part, as the OS that is running on the VM. These are fully-fledged OS, including all the additional pieces of software needed to make the system run. This introduces a ton of additional bloat to the process and reduces the number of VMs that a single host can run.</p>
<p>Think about installing any OS. A fresh installation of Windows, for example, also comes with all the usual additional applications and supporting software. I doubt that our production-grade Nginx server will make plenty of use of a shiny copy of Paint 3D. </p>
<h2 id="enter-docker">Enter Docker</h2>
<p>A container solves the timeless problem of "IDK, man. It works on my machine" and the performance overheads of VMs by providing you a portable, replicable image of your development environment that can run on any OS. When an application is containerized, it is bundled with all of its dependencies. In this way, if I want to run the application on a different machine, I don't need to install anything else other than Docker, as all that makes my application tick comes embedded with the Docker Image.</p>
<p>The reason why this works is that Docker runs its containers directly on our machine's <strong>kernel</strong>. The kernel is the very low-level program that has complete control over both software and hardware in your computer, allowing the two to communicate.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596317886484/oQnh3758L.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Where kernel sits in a computer"></p>
<p>All of the Docker container's processes run along with the main operating system's processes, albeit in a logically isolated fashion. This isolation is made possible by utilities in the Linux kernel, specifically <strong>LXC</strong> (LinuX Containers), <strong>cgroups</strong> (control group), and <strong>namespaces</strong>. The specifics of how these work are a little tricky, but we will explore them in a future tutorial. </p>
<p>Docker is built off of these utilities, extending them and making them easy to use with a high-level API, called the Docker Engine. The Docker Engine is a REST API that can be accessed via HTTP or, most commonly, through a command-line interface. It sends instructions to the Docker Daemon, a constantly running background process that manages every interaction between Docker containers and the machine's kernel.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596302358014/I12LtIqFL.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Levels of interaction with Docker"></p>
<h4 id="comparing-docker-with-vms">Comparing Docker with VMs</h4>
<p>Let's look again at the VM architectural diagram and let's compare it to how Docker does its things.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596298477648/alMXfcmFx.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="VM vs containers"></p>
<p>This is where Docker has an advantage over VMs. Given that, as we explained before, the containers use the kernel of the host to run their processes, there is no overhead to run a container. A container has no kernel booting to do, it uses only the processes that are necessary to run the containerized application, it stops whenever my application stops and does not occupy hardware resources while not in use.</p>
<h4 id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h4>
<p>Docker is a quick way to package applications in the environment that they were developed in, making sure that they can run no matter the underlying infrastructure, configuration, or OS.</p>
<h4 id="even-more-tl-dr">Even more TL;DR</h4>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596235460123/5sSjCOnwM.jpeg?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="How Docker was born"></p>
<h2 id="some-docker-jargon">Some Docker jargon</h2>
<p>We explained what Docker is why it is great, but you surely have heard of Dockerfiles, Docker images, Docker containers, and maybe others. Let's clarify what those things mean.</p>
<h4 id="docker-image">Docker Image</h4>
<p>Docker images are read-only files that are to build containers. They include everything that the containerized process needs to run, such as source code, dependencies, runtimes, and objects. Most crucially, it provides a private filesystem to the container. Images are lightweight, portable, and can be used to deploy applications quickly and at scale. Every image is built from a Docker-specific script called a Dockerfile. </p>
<h4 id="dockerfile">Dockerfile</h4>
<p>A Dockerfile is a recipe that provides <em>mostly</em> clear and sequential instructions on how to build an image. A Dockerfile is composed of a series of <code>[action]</code> <code>[target]</code> commands, each of which creates a new layer. We will cover layers in a later installment of this series, but for now, we can think of these as building blocks that can be individually cached (i.e. saved to memory) for future builds.</p>
<h4 id="docker-container">Docker Container</h4>
<p>Once we build an image from a Dockerfile, we can finally deploy it as a container. Containers are nothing more than instances of Docker images. Multiple containers can run at the same time on the same machine and multiple containers can be instantiated from the same Docker image. Containers live for the time it takes for their processes to run or until they fail. </p>
<p>Combined with an extremely fast start time, we can see why they are valuable in environments that need to scale quickly. We can start as many containers as our underlying infrastructure can handle or as much as our manually allocated resources allow and we can get rid of them just as quickly.</p>
<h4 id="docker-registry">Docker Registry</h4>
<p>If we want to control every detail of our services on our own, we can write a Dockerfile that specifies every single step of the way to get there. But in most use cases we might be interested in running pre-built images of services that we use daily. For that reason, we can browse  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a>, an online registry of pre-built images of various software, from commonly used applications like databases (MySQL, Redis, Postgres, etc...), web servers (Nginx, Apache), or CMS (WordPress) to development environments in most languages (Python, Node.js, Java, etc...).</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596243680676/_m6HenMF4.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Explore-Docker-Hub.png"></p>
<p>The images that you build through your Dockerfiles can be pushed to the various registries, either to DockerHub if we want to make them publicly available or registries like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/">AWS Elastic Container Registry</a>,  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/">Azure Container Registry</a>, or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloud.google.com/container-registry">GCP Container Registry</a> if we want to keep them private. If we want our images to be uber-private, we can also host our private registry by running a local instance of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hub.docker.com/_/registry">Docker Registry</a>, which is available as a Docker image on Docker Hub.</p>
<p>We have now a better idea of the basic building blocks of Docker. We can also identify the cycle of Docker containers, from creation to instantiation.
<img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596255174293/jg6QyfiZV.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Docker Lifecycle"></p>
<h2 id="next-steps-">Next steps?</h2>
<p>Whew! That was already a lot of information to digest! Make sure you understand the underlying concepts of Docker and why so many developers love the fact that it is in this world. In Part 2 of this series, we will start getting our feet wet with the Docker CLI, pull a few images from Docker Hub, and get experience with properly running containers in various use cases.</p>
<p>For now, if you want, keep in touch with me via <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/antonio_lofiego">Twitter</a> and let me know what you think about this guide. I hope you liked your first steps with Docker because it's gonna be a hike!</p>

The exterior construction quality is absolutely top notch. Insides are pretty rough, but that's to be expected for 80's manufacturing capabilities. They didn't have access to specialized tapes (Nitto) and a whole bunch of industries that cater to small electronics manufacturing. If you ever open an iPhone, there is a tremendous amount of systems engineering and DFM/DFA that has lead to a boom in making parts that aid assembly.</p><p>What I admire about CASIO is that they have a consistent design language and I don't mean just the aesthetics. The way they construct their products, the way they make them usable and understandable to the user, the way they communicate the state of the system, the operability, etc. This design language changed over time as the company evolved. The family of products that released in 1983 were different than 1993 in terms of design.</p><p>If somone designed a calculator today, they would most likely be made from ABS plastic, in a clamshell case. An ARM microcontroller that replaces essentially 70% of the chips, and it would be impossible to repair. LCD would be glued in, self tapping screws, and no extra-mile attemps to increase the quality. Infact, the opposite. Modern electronics just feel like everyone is trying to race to the bottom, cut costs at all costs!</p>

          <p><h3><span>An Overview of the Journey</span></h3></p> <p><span>This is a write-up of the 6-month journey of running e-commerce stores that started in Feb 2017. Within two months of iterations, we were making mid-4-figure revenue per month. We eventually stopped when the paid traffic got more costly, and the experimentation became too time-consuming. </span></p> <p><span>While it was not a big success by any means, I hope other entrepreneurs and hustlers out there have something to gain from this case study. </span></p> <p><span>In the spirit of transparency, I will share all the details about the experience, including the day-by-day payout. If there are parts you would like to see more details on, </span> <a href="https://twitter.com/jhlyeung" target="_blank"><span>tweet at me</span></a> <span>. </span></p> <p><span>Here are some numbers for one of the dropshipping stores we had. We will dive into more details in the sections below. </span></p> <p><img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/10dc06ec-da7f-4513-8b37-6c17f9f48df5/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200801%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200801T195239Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=8e0371bdd6fe0b12f7ac92c0736c17cd0b656d4058c36f38692590967a3d03b8&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22Untitled.png%22"></p>  <p><h3><span>The Beginning - Excitement and big goals</span></h3></p> <p><span>Like many internet entrepreneurs, we started looking into e-commerce for "side hustle" ideas, to get us closer to financial freedom and all that good stuff.</span></p> <p><span>We started brainstorming ideas of things we could sell, and attempted to build a brand that would reflect our own desires: minimalist but stylish fashion for men. </span></p> <p><span>We quickly put together a Shopify site, picked a few products to dropship, and launched our first brand </span> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/norwoodlane" target="_blank"><span>Norwood Lane</span></a> <span>.</span></p> <p><span>On paper, dropshipping sounded so appealing: </span> <em>no risk, no need for inventory, high profit margin</em> <span>. All we had to do is pick the right products and find buyers!  It would be profitable as long as customer acquisition cost (CAC) + cost of buying the product from a Chinese supplier is lower than what we sell the item for. Simple unit economics!</span></p> <p><span>We had high hopes, and started dreaming about where the brand can go: which countries to expand to next, how many designers we were going to hire for our own branded products, where we will have our physical locations, which influencers we should reach out to first to promote our products, when I should decide to turn down the job offer from Microsoft...</span></p> <p><span>Very quickly though, reality just hit us in the face...</span></p> <p><span>We were running Facebook and Instagram ads at the time, but </span> <em>the few sales that we made were at a loss</em> <span>.</span></p> <p><strong>Things we tried:</strong> <span> ﻿</span></p> <p><li><span>Targeting different audiences with the ads</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Different ad copies</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Different product offerings: different types of wallets, watches, and other accessories</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Different price points</span></li></p> <p><em>None of that worked.</em></p> <p><span>A few weeks in, it was time for Plan B! The products we were selling at that price point weren't working. We needed to iterate.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Systematically testing product ideas</span></h3></p> <p><span>We decided to launch two more dropshipping stores in parallel - one to test ideas, another to double down on the winning ones:</span></p> <div><li><span>﻿</span> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/theooustore/" target="_blank"><span>The Oou Store</span></a> <span>: selling fun/cute gimmicky gifts. A general gift shop, where we would very quickly test product ideas (along with ad copies).</span></li></div> <p><li><span>A more specialty shop branded around the winning products. We would rebrand it depending on what products seemed to show promise.</span></li></p> <p><span>Each day, we would try an average of 3-5 new products, following this process:</span></p>  <p><li><span>Pick a few that we think could sell, add them to our catalog</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Run 2-3 Facebook ad copies in parallel for each product</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Check responses to the ads a day or two later </span></li></p> <p><span>This was an ongoing process. And after a few weeks of trying many ideas, </span> <em>we finally found a few winners.</em> <span> We found product-ad combos that we could repeatedly profit from.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Examples of products we tried</span></h3></p> <p><span>We tried a variety of products targeted at different niches. Here are some of the more popular items:</span></p> <p><img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/cc718120-451e-45f4-99c1-09cbde8627c1/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200801%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200801T195107Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=7e22925f4c8f52d02ee569f3093de6861ed0aefe5b79db1c1a163a9cd1e0ce8a&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22Untitled.png%22"></p>  <p><span>...and some less successful ones: </span></p> <p><img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/cbfe0681-f35f-475a-be81-4dda8603de98/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200801%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200801T195127Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=0e89220104974d5015b313efa4866b04c500b97dd8c7e3ae10e3ab52778f622f&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22Untitled.png%22"></p>  <p><span>In general, it seemed that the more niche the audience, the better the product performed. But finding a winning product is part art, part science. There were many products that we thought would be winners that flopped, and vice versa.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Doubling down on the winning products</span></h3></p> <p><span>One of the items that started picking up in sales was a flamboyant rash guard featuring a oriental-esque mythical creature:</span></p> <p><img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/9ee2cde0-474d-4bb9-aee6-82e8408587e9/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200801%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200801T195152Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=545de8bbe5c384fca3b4668795bca49bbb3a3fc6c79e24d9562a517907b44628&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22Untitled.png%22"></p> <p><span>First there was order, then another on the same day. Then there was another. We knew something was working.</span></p> <p><span>We moved fast to create a specialty store front to brand around this - </span> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Precision-Fightwear-246986475709277/" target="_blank"><span>Precision Fightwear</span></a> <span>, selling MMA/BJJ training gear. </span></p> <p><span>With the more focused brand, we expanded the product catalog, and replicated the ad campaigns that worked by reallocating our ad spends to the winning products. We curated a few more similar designs from various suppliers, and build our best-selling </span> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=249898468751411&amp;id=246986475709277" target="_blank"><span>Mythical Creatures Collection</span></a> <span>. </span></p> <p><span>We were pricing each product at $40-50 a piece. And we would purchase them from our suppliers for $10-20 each. Our shipping time to the US would be around two weeks, which was an issue for some customers. To address this, we simply had a dedicated email address for shipping inquiries, and manually answered them as soon as we received them. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Distribution channels stop working at some point</span></h3></p> <p><span>Our main marketing channel was paid ads. Facebook ads in particular. We had tried other ad platforms, such as Instagram and Google / Bing ads. But it was with Facebook ads that we were able to consistently make a profit, thanks partly to the great targeting capabilities.</span></p> <p><span>As Charlie Munger would say: repeat what works. We happily did that.</span></p> <p><span>It worked, but only it didn't.</span></p> <p><span>By July, we were starting to see losses on some days, though sales where still coming in. The cost of running ads and buying the products from our suppliers exceeded what we were making from our customers. </span></p> <p><span>Apparently this is common pattern for internal marketing channels in general. So much so that Andrew Chen termed it the </span> <a href="https://andrewchen.co/the-law-of-shitty-clickthroughs/" target="_blank"><span>Law of Shitty Click-throughs</span></a> <span>, and described it as a "strong gravitational pull".</span></p> <p><span>We tried a few more things to fight this gravity. Tweaked the ad copy. Changed the ad audience. We created new product lines, selling Muay Thai gears, and even started selling our own branded rashguard (custom designed, not dropshipped). </span></p> <p><span>A lot of time spent, not much results. A few more months later, we finally decided to wind down the store and put our energy on other projects.</span></p> <p><span>It could have been that we exhausted the niche within MMA enthusiasts. Or that ads were getting more competitive. Or that competitors popped up (a particularly severe issue with dropshipping businesses). There were many factors at play, and we would never know exactly why it stopped working.</span></p>  <p><span>Looking back, it was a good run. Going in with zero prior experience forced us to learn on the fly. And when there were customers banging on our doors, we had no choice but to get our acts together.</span></p> <p><span>Going forward, I don't think dropshipping is for me. It requires a constant effort to keep testing and promoting product ideas. And the process can get exhausting. The flip side of the low-touch model is that it comes with a low level of control. Too many things can eventually go wrong that would be hard to fix, for it to be a sustainable business model.</span></p>

August 1, 2020 | https://timber.fm/stories/when-i-started-podcasting-i-was-stealing-everything-i-could/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://timber.fm/stories/when-i-started-podcasting-i-was-stealing-everything-i-could/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When Jack Rhysider started <a href="https://darknetdiaries.com/"><i>Darknet Diaries</i></a>, he had a blog that got a few thousand hits per day, 3,000 Twitter followers, and a full-time job as a network security engineer. Now, nearly three years and over 70 episodes later, the podcast has been downloaded over 8 million times. The show, which tells “true stories of the dark side of the internet”—including disturbing tales of hacking, data breaches, and cybercrime— is now a full-time job&nbsp; and pays for a production team.</p><blockquote><p>“I threw up my hands and was like, ‘well forget this. I guess people are already doing this.’”</p></blockquote><p>Rhysider is not only humble about his incredible success—he says you can grow a successful show, too. How? He breaks it down into three steps: Make an excellent show, grow your audience, and monetize it—in that order.</p><hr><p><b>Make an Amazing Show</b></p><p><span>Rhysider quickly realized that part of what made his show stand out was not just the stories he was telling, but the way he told them. “We all have different ways that we’ve grown up and the way we look at the world,” he explains. Owning that singularity was one key to Rhysider’s success.</span></p><p><span>When he launched the first four episodes in the fall of 2017, he didn’t see any other podcasters in the high-drama cybersecurity stories space. As soon as he launched, however, he recalls, “I found four shows that were doing the same thing,” which made him “furious” and nearly caused him to quit. “I threw up my hands and was like, ‘well forget this. I guess people are already doing this.’”</span></p><p><span>But he quickly realized he was giving his listeners an experience no one else was offering. any cybersecurity stories were either being told “in very dry and technical ways” or they came out in discrete chunks as the stories unfolded in real time. In contrast, he waited “until the chips had fallen” to let listeners hear the entire story from start to finish in one compelling episode.</span></p><figure id="attachment_359" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-359"><img src="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-300x147.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="295" srcset="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-300x147.jpg 300w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-1024x503.jpg 1024w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-768x377.jpg 768w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-1536x755.jpg 1536w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20295'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-300x147.jpg 300w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-1024x503.jpg 1024w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-768x377.jpg 768w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-1536x755.jpg 1536w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing.jpg 2000w" data-lazy-src="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-300x147.jpg"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-359">Image provided by Rhysider</figcaption></figure><p><span>Not only was he creating stories with a distinct, compelling arc, he was also very deliberate in his delivery, leaning heavily on other creators for inspiration. As the saying goes, “good artists borrow, great artists steal.”</span></p><p><span>“When I started podcasting I was stealing everything I could,” Rhysider says. He listened carefully to podcasters including Ira Glass, Malcolm Gladwell, and Aaron Mehnke. One of his signature sounds—making it sound like two people are talking, when there is only one—came directly from the true-crime podcast </span><a href="https://wondery.com/shows/dirty-john/"><i><span>Dirty John</span></i></a><span>. “They pan to the left and talked with a little filter, and then they pan to the right and talk with a different filter and it was the same narrator.” He remembers thinking, ‘Oh my gosh, that’s so cool. I’m gonna try that.’</span></p><p><span>Podcasters weren’t his only creative influences. At one point, Rhysider sought to emulate the </span><i><span>Fight Club</span></i><span> narrator. “I realized he’s got insomnia, so I need to stay up till 3 am and then try to record the episode at 3 am,” he recalled.</span></p><p><span>Rhysider is adamant that a quality show depends on excellent storytelling—and that you can cultivate that skill. He recommends buying books on podcasting, taking courses, and focusing not just on the technology but the content itself. He says it’s not just “what mic to use, but how to tell a great story and how to be entertaining.”</span></p><p><span>With practice and plenty of study, Rhysider found his own groove: “By Episode 30 or so I had my own voice and my own style.” Clearly, it’s working. The show, which saw 800 downloads per episode in the first week, was rated among the</span> <a href="https://lists.pocketcasts.com/top-podcasts-2019"><span>top 25</span></a><span> podcasts of 2019 by Pocketcasts.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>According to Rhysider, “if you don’t make something great, you’re gonna lose your listeners, which means you have to get new listeners faster than you’re losing the listeners. And that’s difficult.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>When you create a great show, you naturally gain what Rhysider calls “superfans,” people who are so excited about it, who want to share it with their friends and family. “They go into the office and they say, ‘You have to listen to this,’ or they tell their friend, ‘You have to listen to this,’ that’s number one,” he explains.</span></p><hr><p><b>Show Promotion to Grow Your Audience</b></p><p><span>Having spent four months toiling over the first four episodes, Rhysider knew he had something special and began promoting the show right away. He relied on traditional social media marketing strategies, creativity, and, when it came to Facebook, luck.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><figure id="attachment_369" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-369"><img src="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1332" srcset="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-300x156.jpg 300w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-1024x533.jpg 1024w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-768x400.jpg 768w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-1536x799.jpg 1536w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-2048x1065.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%202560%201332'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-300x156.jpg 300w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-1024x533.jpg 1024w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-768x400.jpg 768w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-1536x799.jpg 1536w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-2048x1065.jpg 2048w" data-lazy-src="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-scaled.jpg"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-369">Who is the real Jack Rhysider? Looks like he’s doing something to protect his identity from Google Images.</figcaption></figure><p><span>It turned out, Rhysider had a friend at Facebook “who had a budget to play with.” His friend ended up gifting him $4,000 worth of Facebook ads. In return, his friend experimented with running different types of ad campaigns and had access to the analytics data.</span></p><p><span>Despite not being a huge fan of social media, Rhysider felt his show couldn’t have experienced turbo-charged growth without it. He referred to it as “a magic megaphone that you should not squander.”</span></p><p><span>Rhysider, in fact, only joined Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn after launching </span><i><span>Darknet Diaries</span></i><span>, in order to promote the show. Early on, he invested $500 on paid promotions with Instagram influencers, which he said helped him reach the 5,000 follower mark. From there, he focused on more organic growth on Instagram, continuing to post regularly and interacting with other accounts that were similar to his. He also used Reddit to help grow his audience.</span></p><p><span>Additionally, Rhysider has increased the show’s visibility by taking advantage of other types of networking opportunities. He’s given out </span><i><span>Darknet Diaries</span></i><span> stickers at the many conferences he’s spoken at, has been a guest on about 20 podcasts, and has successfully pitched his show to journalists who mentioned it in publications including </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/18/arts/podcasts-tech-science.html"><i><span>The New York Times</span></i></a><span>, Vulture, and </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/17/grenfell-dust-on-our-lips-darknet-diaries-tip-off-observer-radio-reviews"><i><span>The Guardian</span></i></a><i><span>.</span></i></p><hr><p><b>Monetize</b></p><p><span>With a top-notch show, a huge following, and a strategic approach to monetization, Rhysider has nailed the financial aspect of podcasting. Burnt out on his full-time job, he quit work six months after launching and was able to earn a full-time living six months after that, at the end of 2018. By the beginning of 2019, he had the means to hire additional producers, artists, sound designers, an editor, and a writer.</span></p><p><span>According to one of Rhysider’s </span><a href="https://lime.link/blog/4-methods-for-finding-sponsors-for-your-podcast/"><span>recent blog posts</span></a><span> on Lime Link, he has monetized through ads for the past two years and he’s been very intentional in his approach. Rather than using networks, which wanted to put more ads in his show than he was comfortable with, he uses AdvertiseCast, Megaphone MTM, and Affiliate Ads. “AdvertiseCast does fairly well filling up my ad slots, but because I’m hosted on Megaphone it’s just a matter of enabling MTM and if I have any unfilled ad slots, ads get automatically added in.” Although he said MTM “doesn’t pay very well,” he feels its simple set-up and low-maintenance make it worthwhile. “And if I want to throw in the occasional affiliate deal, then hey why not?” he says, adding,&nbsp; “I typically go for affiliate deals when the sponsor has one but isn’t interested in paying for ads, they just want to pay for results.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Regarding Rhysider’s three-pronged approach to building a successful podcast, he’s clear about one thing: No amount of social media promotion or attempts to monetize will work if you don’t have the foundation of a fantastic show that retains listeners. Beyond that, he hesitates to attribute </span><i><span>Darknet Diaries</span></i><span>’ exponential growth to any one strategy. Rather, he likens his success to the effort it takes to complete a cross-country bicycle trip. “It’s like a flywheel that you keep pushing.”&nbsp;</span></p> </div></div>]]>

<p>Tools shape both their user and their result.
Paradigms of C and C++ have molded generations of systems programmers, the ubiquity and staying power of both languages is a testament to their utility.
But the resultant software has suffered decades of <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/16/a-proactive-approach-to-more-secure-code/">memory corruption CVEs</a>.</p>
<p>Rust, as a compiled language <a href="https://blog.discordapp.com/why-discord-is-switching-from-go-to-rust-a190bbca2b1f">without garbage collection</a>, supports what have traditionally been C/C++ domains.
This includes everything from high-performance distributed systems to microcontroller firmware.
Rust offers an alternative set of paradigms, namely <a href="https://depth-first.com/articles/2020/01/27/rust-ownership-by-example/">ownership and lifetimes</a>.
If you've never tried Rust, imagine pair programming alongside a nearly-omniscient but narrowly-focused perfectionist.
That's what the borrow checker, a compiler component implementing the ownership concept, can sometimes feel like.
In exchange for the associated learning curve, we get memory safety guarantees.</p>
<p>Like many in the security community, I've been drawn to Rust by the glittering promise of a safe alternative.
But what does "safe" actually mean on a technical level?
Is the draw one of moths to flame, or does Rust fundamentally change the game?</p>
<p>This post is my attempt to answer these questions, based on what I've learned so far.
Memory safety is a topic knee-deep in operating system and computer architecture concepts, so I have to assume formidable prior systems security knowledge to keep this post short-ish.
Whether you're already using Rust or are just flirting with the idea, hope you find it useful!</p>
<h2 id="what-exactly-are-the-memory-safety-guarantees-in-terms-of-exploitability">What exactly are the "memory safety guarantees"? In terms of exploitability?</h2>
<p>Let's start with the good news. Rust largely prevents a major vector for information leakage and malicious code execution:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Stack protection:</strong> Classic stack-smashing is now an <em>exception</em> and not <em>memory corruption</em>; attempts to write past the end of a buffer will trigger a panic instead of leading to <em>buffer overflow</em>. Regardless of panic handling logic (e.g. <a href="https://crates.io/crates/panic-reset"><code>panic_reset</code></a>), your application could still be subject to <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/730.html">Denial of Service (DoS)</a> attacks. This is why fuzzing Rust is <a href="https://blog.hackeriet.no/fuzzing-sequoia/">still worthwhile</a>. But, as the panic prevents attacker-controlled stack corruption, you won't fall victim to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary_code_execution">Arbitrary or Remote Code Execution (ACE and RCE, respectively)</a>. Attempts to read past the end of a buffer are similarly stopped, so <a href="https://blog.getreu.net/projects/embedded-system-security-with-Rust/">no Heartbleed-style bugs</a>. Enforcement is dynamic: the compiler inserts runtime bounds checks where necessary, incurring small performance overhead. Bounds checks are more effective than the stack cookies a C compiler might insert because they still apply when indexing linear data structures, an operation that's easier to get right with Rust's <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/index.html">iterator APIs</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Heap protection:</strong> Bounds checks and panic behavior still apply to <a href="https://heap-exploitation.dhavalkapil.com/">heap-allocated</a> objects. In addition, the ownership paradigm eliminates dangling pointers, preventing <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html">Use-After-Free (UAF)</a> and <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/415.html">Double-Free (DF)</a> vulnerabilities: heap metadata is never corrupted. Memory leaks (meaning never freeing allocations, not over-reading data) are still possible if a programmer creates <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-06-reference-cycles.html">cyclical references</a>. Compile-time static analysis does the enforcement, soundly reasoning about abstract states representing all possible dynamic executions. There is no runtime cost. Effectiveness is maximal: the program simply can't enter a bad state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>References are always valid and variables are initialized before use:</strong> safe Rust doesn't allow manipulation of raw pointers, ensuring that pointer dereferences are valid. This means no <code>NULL</code> dereferences for DoS and no pointer manipulation for control flow hijack or arbitrary read/write. The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html"><code>Option</code> type</a> facilitates error handling when <code>NULL</code> is a concept the programmer wishes to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/nomicon/ffi.html#the-nullable-pointer-optimization">logically express</a>. These are compile-time guarantees, courtesy of ownership and lifetimes. A similar compile-time guarantee ensures variables can't be read until they've been initialized. Use of uninitialized variables is a warning in most modern C compilers; that aspect isn't novel. But ensuring valid dereferences certainly is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data races are completely eliminated:</strong> Rust's ownership system ensures that any given variable can only have one writer (e.g. a mutable reference) at any given program point, but an unlimited number of readers (e.g. immutable references). In addition to enabling memory safety, this scheme solves the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readers%E2%80%93writers_problem">classic readers-writers concurrency problem</a>. Thus Rust eliminates data races, sometimes without the need for synchronization primitives or reference counting - but not <a href="https://youtu.be/ADbCqH7_SAs?t=669">race conditions in general</a>. Data race prevention reduces opportunities for <a href="https://www.redballoonsecurity.com/publications/papers/Concurrency_Attacks.pdf">concurrency attacks</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All good things in life come with a caveat. Let's look at the fine print:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Not all Rust code is memory safe:</strong> Satisfying the compiler's analyses is part of what makes implementing certain data structures, like <a href="https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/fourth.html">doubly-linked lists</a>, challenging in Rust. Moreover, certain low-level operations, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_I/O">Memory Mapped I/O (MMIO)</a>, are difficult to <a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/register-rs">fully analyze</a> for safety. Blocks of code marked as <code>unsafe</code> are manually-designated "blindspots" for the analyses, bypassing safety-specific checks since the programmer vouches for their correctness. This includes parts of Rust's standard library, for which <a href="https://gts3.org/2019/cve-2018-1000657.html">CVE numbers have been assigned</a>, and, by extension, any external libraries called via C <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface">Foreign Function Interface</a> (CFFI). Furthermore, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03296">researchers have found</a> that ownership's automatic destruction can create new (meaning unique to Rust) UAF and DF patterns in <code>unsafe</code> code. <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity18/sec18-silvestro.pdf">Hardened allocators</a>, which check heap consistency invariants dynamically, aren't entirely obsolete. Memory safety guarantees apply <em>broadly</em>, not <em>universally</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>unsafe</code> drops memory safety guarantees for a limited scope and doesn't eliminate all checks:</strong> <code>unsafe</code> isn't a free-for-all. Type, lifetime, and reference checks are still active; high-risk operations have explicit APIs (e.g. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.get_unchecked"><code>get_unchecked</code></a>). While memory corruption is possible with <code>unsafe</code>, the possibility is constrained to small portions of your codebase - around 1% of a typical Rust library <a href="https://youtu.be/NQBVUjdkLAA?t=1413">by one estimate</a>. From a security audit perspective, that's a colossal reduction in attack surface for a major bug class. Think of <code>unsafe</code> as a small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_computing_base">Trusted Computing Base (TCB)</a> in a larger system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interior mutability can push borrow checks to runtime:</strong> the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-05-interior-mutability.html">interior mutability pattern</a> allows multiple mutable aliases to a single memory location so long as they're not in use simultaneously. It's a sidestep of the borrow checker, a fallback when the problem can't be <a href="https://crates.io/crates/indextree">reframed in an idiomatic way</a> for powerful compile-time guarantees. Safe <em>wrappers</em> for <code>unsafe</code> APIs (e.g. <code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>, <code>Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>) verify exclusivity at runtime, incurring a performance penalty and introducing the potential to panic. I couldn't find metrics on how widely used this pattern is or isn't, but would again recommend <a href="https://rust-fuzz.github.io/book/afl/tutorial.html">fuzzing</a> for probabilistic panic detection.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To be honest, decades of hardware, OS, and compiler-level defenses have hardened C and C++ deployments.
Memory corruption 0-days aren't exactly low-hanging fruit.
Yet Rust still feels like a significant step forward and a noteworthy improvement to the security posture of performance-critical software.
Even though the <code>unsafe</code> escape hatch must exist, memory corruption - a large and vicious bug class - is largely eliminated.</p>
<p>So is Rust the new messiah, sent to save us from the hell of remote shell?
Definitely not.
Rust won't stop command injection (e.g. part of an input string ending up as an argument to <code>execve</code>).
Or misconfiguration (e.g. fallback to an insecure cipher).
Or logic bugs (e.g. forgetting to verify user permissions).
No general purpose programming language will make your code inherently secure or formally correct.
But at least you don't have to worry about these kinds of mistakes <em>and</em> maintaining <a href="https://alexgaynor.net/2019/apr/21/modern-c++-wont-save-us/">complex, invisible memory invariants</a> throughout your Rust codebase.</p>
<h2 id="ok-what-about-embedded-systems-aren-t-those-super-vulnerable">OK, what about embedded systems? Aren't those super vulnerable?</h2>
<p>Let's assume "embedded" means no OS abstractions; the software stack is a single, monolithic binary (e.g. AVR or Cortex-M firmware) or part of the OS itself (e.g. kernel or bootloader). Rust's <a href="http://cliffle.com/blog/m4vga-in-rust/#on-no-std"><code>!#[no_std]</code> attribute</a> facilitates developing for embedded platforms.
<code>!#[no_std]</code> Rust libraries typically forsake dynamic collections (like <code>Vec</code> and <code>HashMap</code>) for portability to baremetal environments (no memory allocator, no heap).
The borrow checker barrier is minimal without dynamic memory, so prototyping ease remains roughly equivalent to embedded C - albeit with <a href="https://forge.rust-lang.org/release/platform-support.html">fewer</a> supported <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/install/specific.html">architectures</a>.</p>
<p>The resource-constrained and/or real-time embedded systems <code>!#[no_std]</code> targets often lack modern mitigations like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvug1Hup2iA">a Memory Protection Unit (MPU), No eXecute (NX), or Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)</a>.
We're talking about a lawless land where memory is flat and no one can hear you segfault.
But Rust still gives us that sweet, sweet bound check insurance when running baremetal without an allocator.
That's noteworthy because it might be the <em>first</em> and <em>last</em> line of defense in an embedded scenario.
Just remember that low-level interaction with hardware will probably require some amount of <code>unsafe</code> code, in which memory access without bounds check is opt-in.</p>
<p>For x86/x64, <em>stack probes</em> are also inserted by Rust the compiler to detect <em>stack overflow</em>.
At present, this feature doesn't apply to <code>!#[no_std]</code> or other architectures - although <a href="https://blog.japaric.io/stack-overflow-protection/">creative linking solutions</a> have been suggested.
Stack probes, often implemented via guard pages, prevent exhausting stack space due to unending recursion.
Bounds checks, on the other hand, prevent stack or heap-based <em>buffer overflow</em> bugs.
It's a subtle distinction, but an important one: for security, we typically care far more about the latter.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that memory, from the perspective of Rust, is a software abstraction.

<p>I was looking at one of my classic Macs a few weeks ago, and noticed that my Ubuntu 18.04 netatalk server wasn’t showing up in the Chooser anymore. If you’re not familiar with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://netatalk.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">netatalk</a>, it’s an implementation of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Filing_Protocol" target="_blank">Apple Filing Protocol (AFP)</a> that runs on Unix-like operating systems such as Linux and NetBSD. It allows other operating systems to act as Mac file servers. Version 2.x, which I use, supports the ancient AppleTalk protocol. This allows it to work with really old classic Macs that don’t even have a TCP/IP stack installed. Support for AppleTalk was removed in version 3.x, so that’s why I’m still using 2.x.</p>



<p>I checked out the server, and noticed that atalkd wasn’t running.</p>

<p>Hmmm….why wouldn’t atalkd be running? I went ahead and tried to restart netatalk:</p>

<p>Uh oh! Why won’t netatalk start?</p>

<p>This setup had been working forever. What could have possibly changed? I was keeping up to date with all of my Ubuntu updates. I had already needed to <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/netatalk/+bug/1839015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">manually patch the netatalk binary due to another bug</a>. Maybe I needed to reapply the patch? But no, the netatalk binary hadn’t been updated. That wasn’t it.</p>



<p>I tried some Googling and noticed that recently <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/net/appletalk?id=6cc03e8aa36c51f3b26a0d21a3c4ce2809c842ac" target="_blank">AppleTalk had been patched so that you can’t create raw sockets without the CAP_NET_RAW capability</a>, so I fiddled with setcap to set that capability on the atalkd binary, but that didn’t seem to fix anything, so I undid all the capability changes I tested.</p>



<p>After further experimentation, I realized that the appletalk kernel module wasn’t being loaded:</p>



<pre>doug@miniserver:~$ lsmod | grep appletalk<br>doug@miniserver:~$</pre>



<p>Naturally, I tried to load it myself:</p>



<pre>doug@miniserver:~$ sudo modprobe appletalk<br>modprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'appletalk': Cannot allocate memory</pre>



<p>Aha! There’s the real problem. Why can’t it allocate memory? I wondered if it was something specific to this particular machine. To test my theory, I headed over to my desktop Linux machine and ran the same modprobe command. It failed with the exact same error.</p>



<p>At this point after trying to do more research, I gave up for a while because I had more important stuff to worry about. It’s kind of difficult to search for info about this type of problem, because hardly anybody is using the AppleTalk networking layer in Linux anymore. “There are dozens of us!”</p>



<p>I finally came back and did some more troubleshooting. Since I knew it had worked before, I tried installing various kernel versions in a VM. Sure enough, Ubuntu’s 5.0.0 kernel worked fine. So this was definitely a kernel issue if I wasn’t already convinced.</p>



<p>Next, I tried <a href="https://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a bunch of upstream kernel versions</a>. I narrowed the problem down to sometime between kernels 5.0 and 5.1-rc1. Then I ran a git bisect between those versions, following the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/KernelBisection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">instructions on the Ubuntu wiki for bisecting upstream kernels</a>. I also used “make localmodconfig” (followed by enabling appletalk in “make menuconfig”) to speed up the compile process after I noticed that most of the compile time was being spent building kernel modules that I wouldn’t be loading anyway.</p>



<p>The bisect process took quite a while. I probably should have figured out a way to automate it with qemu using a strategy similar to the one used in <a href="https://ldpreload.com/blog/git-bisect-run" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this excellent blog post</a>. But nevertheless, it finally settled on this commit from March 2019 being the start of the problem:</p>



<p><a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=6377f787aeb945cae7abbb6474798de129e1f3ac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[6377f787aeb945cae7abbb6474798de129e1f3ac] appletalk: Fix use-after-free in atalk_proc_exit</a></p>



<p>This commit simply does a better job of checking return values of the functions called by atalk_init, and cleaning up properly if they fail. In particular, the return values of these functions, which were previously ignored, are now checked to ensure they succeed:</p>



<ul><li>sock_register</li><li>register_netdevice_notifier</li><li>atalk_proc_init</li><li>atalk_register_sysctl</li></ul>



<p>Further inspection revealed atalk_proc_init as the real culprit. <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/net/appletalk?id=e2bcd8b0ce6ee3410665765db0d44dd8b7e3b348" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A refactor of atalk_proc_init, which happens to be the previous commit to the one linked above</a>, accidentally left the code in a state where it would return -ENOMEM instead of 0 on success. So it always returns -ENOMEM, regardless of success or failure. This explains the “Cannot allocate memory” error being reported when I attempted to insert the appletalk module.</p>



<p>Armed with this info, I did something really disgusting. I made a copy of the kernel module in /tmp and hacked it by tweaking bytes in a hex editor. A disassembly of atalk_proc_init reveals a line of code that loads a value of 0xFFFFFFF4 (-12) into the EAX register just before it exits. ENOMEM is defined as 12. So this is the line that’s causing it to return -ENOMEM. I simply hacked this line to load 0 into EAX instead. This basically leaves the logic working the same way it used to work before the two aforementioned patches were applied, because the return value was previously being ignored anyway.</p>



<p>Before:</p>



<pre>294:   b8 f4 ff ff ff          mov $0xfffffff4,%eax</pre>



<p>After:</p>



<pre>294:   b8 00 00 00 00          mov $0x0,%eax</pre>



<p>This hack by itself didn’t solve the problem:</p>



<pre>doug@miniserver:~$ sudo insmod /tmp/appletalk.ko<br>insmod: ERROR: could not insert module /tmp/appletalk.ko: Key was rejected by service</pre>



<p>The problem here is that Ubuntu’s kernel modules are signed. After hacking the binary, it no longer matched its signature. This is an indicator of just how ugly my hack is. So I did something even uglier: I stripped the signature out of the module completely:</p>



<pre>doug@miniserver:~$ strip --strip-debug /tmp/appletalk.ko</pre>



<p>Then, I tried loading it again:</p>



<pre>doug@miniserver:~$ sudo insmod /tmp/appletalk.ko<br>doug@miniserver:~$</pre>



<p>Success! My dmesg log reports an error about a failed signature, thus tainting the kernel:</p>



<pre>[ 4479.495054] appletalk: module verification failed: signature and/or required key missing - tainting kernel</pre>



<p>But this doesn’t matter for my purposes. netatalk works now:</p>



<pre>doug@miniserver:~$ sudo service netatalk restart<br>doug@miniserver:~$ ps ax | grep atalkd<br>1698 ? S 0:00 /usr/sbin/atalkd<br>1716 pts/0 S+ 0:00 grep --color=auto atalkd</pre>



<p>Now I can store the hacked version of the module in the correct subdirectory in /lib/modules, and everything works automatically when I reboot. Yay!</p>



<p>This is a really ugly fix though. Whenever I upgrade my kernel, I’m going to have to manually patch it. That is, until the patch hits the mainline kernel, and then I can hope that Ubuntu pulls the fix into their kernel. The reason I’m documenting the binary patch here is because realistically, it’s going to take forever for the kernel fix to get released. I have no idea if it will be possible to convince Ubuntu to pull this fix into their kernels once it’s released. It’s not a high-priority bug fix because nobody uses AppleTalk anymore. And I don’t want to limit myself to an old kernel just for this silly reason.</p>



<p>So the first step here is to submit the patch to the linux-netdev mailing list, and get the fix merged into the mainline kernel. I searched the mailing list, and discovered that I wasn’t the first one to run into this bug. Actually, two separate people have both tried to fix it, but had their patches rejected for minor reasons:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&amp;m=157058496118854&amp;w=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[PATCH] net/appletalk: restore success case for atalk_proc_init()</a><ul><li>In this case, someone submitted a patch 10 months ago and was asked to tweak the patch. Then life got in the way (I totally understand), and he finally tried again about 9 months later:</li><li><a href="https://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&amp;m=159403465307674&amp;w=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[PATCH v2] net/appletalk: restore success case for atalk_proc_init()</a></li><li>He was also asked to tweak the second patch because of a minor style issue (which I also understand). A third try at submitting the patch hasn’t been attempted as of this writing.</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&amp;m=159541831715585&amp;w=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[PATCH 1/2] appletalk: Fix atalk_proc_init return path</a><ul><li>This is a more recent attempt from someone else, about a week and a half ago as of this writing. The author submitted this fix together with another unrelated AppleTalk patch, and the patch set was rejected for various minor issues (also understandable). A second version hasn’t been submitted as of this writing.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>Obviously not too many people are using the appletalk kernel module these days, or else people would be up in arms about how it has been broken since kernel 5.1. I would offer up my own third attempt at getting this patch merged, but since two attempts were made just last month, I suspect one of them will succeed shortly. I hope so, anyway. In the meantime, I guess I’ll just continue binary patching my kernel module.</p>



<p>I think there is an even bigger long-term solution than this kernel fix. Classic Mac users who use netatalk with AppleTalk need to join forces to address a few things. netatalk 2.x is dead, but the last release of it is broken on Linux, at least the AppleTalk portion of it — which is the only reason I would still use it. Maybe we …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Usually I sit down and write these in one pass. This month I kept <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a> open in a window for a while and just took notes on thoughts, in in sort of a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine">Matt Levine</a>-esque <a href="https://www.philma.me/projects/everything-is-securities-fraud">style</a>.</p><h3 id="the-pareto-principle-for-engineering-difficulty">The pareto principle for engineering difficulty</h3><p>Once you’re settled in, 95% of programming isn’t hard. It doesn’t involve algorithms, hard design problems, performance or storage constraints. It isn’t worth blogging about.</p><p>5% or less of programming is hard: it’s the stuff that interview questions refer to. You might need to think about <em>algorithms</em>, might need to try out multiple strategies before deciding on the one.</p><p>It’s easy to screw up the 95%, though - by bad day-to-day engineering practices, by overcomplicating problems, and lots of other ways. It’s common to screw up the 95%, and the numbers work out that you have plenty of bugs in systems that are doing ‘easy’ things.</p><p>We should balance our attention for the majority of easy tasks and the minority of hard ones. Why do interviews only ask about knowledge that you need a few times a year, and not about habits you need every day? Should we use a language or platform that makes the routine code convenient, or the impressive code more impressive?</p><h3 id="reading">Reading</h3><blockquote><p>We are all sufferers from history, but the paranoid is a double sufferer, since he is afflicted not only by the real world, with the rest of us, but by his fantasies as well.</p></blockquote><p>I finally read <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/1964/11/the-paranoid-style-in-american-politics/">The Paranoid Style in American Politics, the famous 1964 piece by Richard Hofstadter</a>.</p><p>It’s still relevant but I think two things have changed about the paranoid style:</p><ul><li>The paranoid people are winning. In Hofstadter’s time they were a marginal viewpoint: now they’re the default. The radius of QAnon and other fringe theories is staggeringly large right now. Even folks who don’t identify with Q casually accept many of its idiotic theories.</li><li>The obsession with citing facts in paranoid literature that Hofstadter mentions is no longer a thing: modern paranoia is untethered.</li></ul><h3 id="here-is-a-mild-take-on-javascript">Here is a mild take on JavaScript</h3><p>Using objects for data is one of the worst things about JavaScript. It’s really nice in other languages that you have one kind of object that’s part of your application and another that’s used for representing data. Ruby’s Hash, Python’s Dictionary, Java’s many datatypes, etc. JavaScript, traditionally, uses the same basic idea to represent all kinds of objects.</p><p>Basically every time that someone tries to use JavaScript objects for data, they write a security vulnerability by way of prototype pollution. The <code>Map</code> and <code>Set</code> datatypes help with this, but their relative unpopularity and inability to be directly serialized into JSON - and the fact that most developers are late to learn about them - means that a lot of people are just using objects for everything. And that’s, really often, a problem.</p><h3 id="the-core-cool-idea">The core cool idea</h3><p>My usual advice for <a href="https://macwright.com/2019/08/25/side-projects.html">finishing side projects</a> includes some variation on “be relentless about simplicity,” which translates into avoiding feature creep. The inverse is more instructive, though: know what the cool part is. For example, this month I <a href="https://twitter.com/tmcw/status/1282123824901681153">made a small multiples visualization of a YouTube channel</a> that the internet generally liked. I made the project in one sitting and spent the last 45 minutes trying to make it interactive, so that you could click on the videos or hover over them and hear audio from each one. I was annoyed at this process because I was trying to implement it in a simple and lightweight way, and there was none. But I decided to avoid it: because making the thing interactive was too much work, but because I knew that what I had already made was the cool part. The interactivity might make it 10% cooler, but I had already done was the embodiment of the driving question, the implementation of the core cool idea.</p><p>Know what the core cool idea is. Side projects need one. If the core idea isn’t cool, you won’t be able to make the project cool by adding more stuff.</p><h3 id="politics">Politics</h3><p>I’m working through <a href="https://librivox.org/progress-and-poverty-by-henry-george/">Henry George’s Progress and Poverty as a free audiobook</a>, which has influenced my political-economic leanings from a distance for a while.</p><p>I think a bit about housing nowadays. I live in a major city with a housing crisis. Every single major American city has a housing crisis. Here’s one of my thoughts that I’m trying to refine:</p><p>Housing is both <em>real</em> (it can be used) and capital (it is a store of value). In coastal cities, owning a $1M house is more similar to owning $1M of stock than it is to owning $1M of cars or computers. The real goods depreciate in value quickly, the house is expected to gain value. Buying &amp; selling the car is like buying &amp; selling another real good, whereas the trading in real estate has stock-like tax advantages. But unlike more commonly accepted forms of capital (like stocks or bonds), the appreciation of the house is supposedly natural. When its value decreases, we pity the owner, whereas we tend to see crashing stocks as an ‘expected risk’.</p><p>Housing doesn’t have to be have so much like capital, and in many places it isn’t. But in America it does: both the political left and right are attached to the idea of housing being a wealth creation strategy.</p><p>The take is: housing can’t simultaneously produce wealth, be a safe investment, and be produced in enough quantity to avert crises. That’s the punchline. We want it to be part of two exclusive categories. It can’t, and most people end up advantaging the investment characteristics over the thing-people-need-to-live-in ‘real good’ characteristics.</p><p>To solve the housing crisis, we need to make housing worse, as an investment.</p><h3 id="the-answer-to-everything-is-maybe">The answer to everything is maybe</h3><p>Reading <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/compendium/types?share_key=baf6b67369843fa2">types: a programmers compendium</a> really drives home the point that <em>most bright-line definitions in software engineering aren’t real.</em> What a ‘strong type system’ <em>is</em> is really poorly defined. Same with a lot of concepts – things like ‘functional programming’ are more styles than they are categories.</p><p>Even ideas about performance aren’t really… real. Many languages have different implementations of, say, sorting, depending on data types and list lengths: saying “sorting is O(n log n)” is really a gamble.</p><p>Is HTML a programming language? The answer is <em>sort of</em>? You can do logic in it, like you can do logic in almost every system: CSS is a programming language. Calling one ‘markup’ and the other…&nbsp;the <a href="https://macwright.com/2012/10/03/considering-css.html">only mainstream example of its rather peculiar family</a> doesn’t really help anyone understand anything.</p><h3 id="its-hard-to-find-simple-technology">It’s hard to find simple technology</h3><p>I think my biggest disappointment with Rust is that it isn’t simple. It can <em>create</em> simple programs: with the right compiler flags, it’ll produce very small executables with minimal fluff, but the language itself is dramatically complex. The compiler is huge and fiendish. Language features are numerous and subtle.</p><p>Other mainstream systems are complicated. <a href="https://v8.dev/">V8</a> is an incredible engineering accomplishment and is really, really sophisticated. Practically every language and its implementation has grown significantly.</p><p>There are kind of few reasons to worry about this complexity in the 9-5, but in my free time it has me thinking about things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_BASIC">Tiny BASIC</a>, Forth, and Scheme - though even in the case of Scheme it’s hard to find an implementation that hasn’t grown a JIT or other fancy features.</p><p>On the Rust/Go-side of things, I’ve been paying a lot of attention to <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a> - I think it’s pretty neat. It isn’t a ‘big idea’ language, just a really cleanly-designed C-like language that seems fix the main problems with C. And it’s really simple: the syntax is simple and it doesn’t have many big theories. It seems like it occupies a tiny portion of the current mindshare but for little CLI tools and systems software, could be really important.</p><p>After I started writing this, the ever-interesting <a href="https://twitter.com/everestpipkin">Everest Pipkin</a> published a <a href="https://github.com/everestpipkin/tools-list">list of tiny tools</a>, which is absolutely incredible - <a href="https://github.com/everestpipkin/tools-list#fantasy-consoles">fantasy consoles</a> is chock full of simple-at-their-core systems.</p><h3 id="helping-to-avert-the-apocalypse">Helping to avert the apocalypse</h3><p>In almost every way, the world is teetering on the brink. What can you do? It’s tempting to shut off the news and just get some work done when you can focus, and admittedly that’s what I’ve been doing most of the time. But there has to be something else.</p><p>In America, obviously part of this is <a href="https://joebiden.com/">voting for Joe Biden</a>. He’s the ‘anti-apocalypse’ candidate who couldn’t do worse than his predecessor even if he tried. He wasn’t my <a href="https://macwright.com/2019/05/16/elizabeth-warren.html">first pick</a>. But we aren’t choosing favorites anymore: we’re trying to avert the apocalypse, and there is no excuse to sit it out. If you don’t vote and the apocalypse happens, I’m blaming you.</p><p>Then there are other campaigns: donating to small, competitive candidates throughout the country. The smartest way to do this, I think, is by spreading donations between races that are picked by researchers. <a href="https://idlewords.com/">Maciej Cegłowski</a> has two such efforts: <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/great_slate">The Great Slate</a> (four rural house campaigns) and <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/state_slate_2">The State Slate</a> (eleven state house campaigns). He researches &amp; interviews candidates, configures an ActBlue page to split donations amongst them, and then you donate: it’s simple. <a href="https://blueprint.swingleft.org/">Blueprint</a> is doing something similar - splitting donations between ActBlue campaigns - but has visual polish like a fin-tech company and a more DC-insider staff. Both are ways of efficiently allocating donations to useful campaigns. They’re like value-factor index funds for political change.</p><p>When you allocate resources to useful campaigns, they are often Democrats running in conservative areas, so they’re often misaligned from you in one or more ways. It sucks that my donations go to folks with wishy-washy views on immigration policy or transit: but, again, we aren’t picking favorites anymore.</p><h2 id="nostalgia-bot">Nostalgia bot</h2><p>I’ve been following <a href="https://twitter.com/everyblock">every lot dc</a> for a while and it’s the first time that a Twitter robot has really resonated.

    <p>A Youtube video from 2009 was right - the "Four Chord" song truly is built on the most popular progression of four chords, based on an analysis of over one million songs.</p>
    <p>In 2009, the musical group <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pidokakU4I">“Axis of Awesome” demonstrated the ubiquity of the what they call the <em>“Four Chord”</em> song</a>. They assert the that most popular songs of the last 40 years use a particular and popular progression of four chords: C-G-Am-F.</p>
<p>I wanted to see just how popular this particular progression is, so I asked the question: <strong>Are the four chords mentioned by the “Axis of Awesome” (C-G-Am-F) the most represented set of four chords?</strong></p>
<p>Not only did I get the answer, but this question ended up resulting in <a href="https://schollz.github.io/chords/">a new web app to find chord progressions</a>.</p>
<h2 id="gathering-and-analyzing-song-data">Gathering and analyzing song data</h2>
<p>To gather song data to analyze, I first wrote a program that parsed guitar tabs and extracted chords. The data sample included more than one million songs from almost every genre (except for classical), including blues, jazz, pop, rock, country, folks, etc. I divided each song into sections (i.e. Verse, Chorus, Pre-chorus) and collected the names of chords contained in each section. To aid in comparison, I transposed all the chords in each section of each song so that they were in the same key, the key of C.</p>
<p>Once the data was ready, I found that I had compiled over two thousand different four-chord progressions.</p>
<p>To rank these chord progressions I used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo">Markov chain Monte Carlo</a> to sample the probability distribution of
four-chord progressions. This produced a list from <em>most</em> to <em>least</em> common chord progressions.</p>
<h2 id="most-four-chord-progressions">Most four-chord progressions</h2>
<p>After analyzing the one million plus songs, I had a list of the most common four-chord progressions. Guess which chord progress topped the list at the most probable?</p>
<p>C G Am F</p>
<p>probability = 7.6%</p>
<p>Yes, Axis of Awesome <em>was</em> right! Their “Four Chord” song encompasses the most popular progression I found.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the next six most common sets of four-chord progressions are permutations on these specific four chords:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Am F C G</p>
<p>probability = 5.1%</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>C Am F G</p>
<p>probability = 4.4%</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>F C G Am</p>
<p>probability = 2.3%</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>C F Am G</p>
<p>probability = 2.0%</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>F C Am G</p>
<p>probability = 1.5%</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>F G C Am</p>
<p>probability = 1.4%</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>After that you start getting chord patterns that include new minor chords like <em>Em</em> and <em>Dm</em>:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>C Em Am F</p>
<p>probability = 1.3%</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>C G Dm F</p>
<p>probability = 1.3%</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Dm F C G</p>
<p>probability = 1.3%</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>C Am G F</p>
<p>probability = 1.1%</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Am Dm G C</p>
<p>probability = 1.1%</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>C Em F G</p>
<p>probability = 1.1%</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>It isn’t until about 60 chord progressions later that you get progressions that have any other chords, such as <em>Bb</em>.  For example, these are the most popular two:</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>C G Bb F</p>
<p>probability = 0.3%</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>F C Dm Bb</p>
<p>probability = 0.3%</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Those are just some of the most popular – there are many, <em>many</em>, more progressions.</p>
<h2 id="exploring-progressions-from-millions-of-songs">Exploring progressions from millions of songs</h2>
<p>It turns out that there is evidence that what Axis of Awesome claimed in 2009 is true: The most common four-chord progression seems to be C-G-Am-F. The other most common progressions are variations on those four chords, with addition of the other minors (Dm, and Em).</p>
<p>What about the other two thousand progressions? In order to explore them I built a chord-finding app based on the analysis of those million songs: <a href="https://schollz.github.io/chords/">https://schollz.github.io/chords/</a> Use it to help build your own progressions, and think about new music to create.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Starting September 1st, I'm shutting down the user-facing portion of <a href="https://invidio.us/">https://invidio.us</a> and stepping away from development. If you have an account on the site, you can export your data <a href="https://invidio.us/data_control">here</a>, which will allow you to import everything to <a href="https://instances.invidio.us/">another instance</a> or self-host.</p>
<p>The API will continue to function until October 1st, to give time for any services relying on it to migrate to other solutions. If you're a patron on Liberapay, I would urge you to switch your donation to <a href="https://liberapay.org/iv-org">iv-org</a>, as that will ensure it goes to the stewards of the project going forward.</p>
<hr>
<p>At the time of this writing, the main Invidious instance has roughly 35,000 users. It's difficult for me to even begin to think of those as actual people, and not just a number. At that level, the amount of feedback I receive, which I would consider rather small in comparison to others I've seen, is overwhelming. It's demoralizing not being able to respond to all of it properly. Even more so when I've received something that deserves an involved response, but I haven't had the time to reply, which counter-intuitively means the best comments are least likely to receive any response. To echo <a href="http://antirez.com/news/129">antirez</a>: it's crushing not being able to be "there" for people.</p>
<p>Lately, I've felt myself withdraw much more in return. For any project though, especially something that requires maintanence, it's difficult to actually "unplug" and mentally recharge. Turning off notifications has helped, but it's definitely taken its toll.</p>
<p>For any project of a certain size, it's more important for the lead to be a manager more than a developer. As an example, it's mostly well-known that Linus Torvalds <a href="https://youtu.be/H8Gd9t7FQqI?t=525">hardly does any coding anymore</a>. At that point working on a side-project becomes a job, and not one I particularly enjoy. If I had known that I would've ended up in that position on a passion project, I'm curious if I would have made it open-source, or started working on it at all.</p>
<p>In either case, I consider myself extremely lucky to have people that can manage the project in future, and can only imagine what it would be like for someone without that luxury. I can't help shake the feeling that somewhere, the software I use is being developed solely by volunteers who would rather quit, but don't have the ability to say "no". This post has been delayed for that very reason, especially when so many people have given so much, and I feel they deserve a proper goodbye. At this point though, I can't find the strength to leave on better terms.</p>
<p>I don't want this to read like I somehow feel underappreciated or underpaid. I'm not motivated by praise or money. After working on the same thing for three years, I'm just tired and ready to move on.</p>

        <div>
            <p>I bought a couple EdgeStar AP14001HS portable air conditioners in April 2020, since I expect to spend most of the Summer at home.  I'm not able to use window A/Cs here, though that would be the obvious choice for efficiency because all the hot parts remain outside.</p>
<h3>Similar models</h3>
<p>From looking at Internet photos, these A/Cs appear to follow the same general desgin:</p>
<ul>
<li>EdgeStar AP14001HS</li>
<li>Whynter ARC-14S</li>
<li>Whynter ARC-14SH</li>
<li>Whynter ARC-141BG</li>
<li>Whynter ARC-143MX</li>
</ul>
<p>I can't say to what extent they are identical, but the stuff on this page <em>might</em> apply to all of them.</p>
<h3>Air Gaps</h3>
<p>I wanted a dual-hose air conditioner because single-hose models are thermodynamically suboptimal.  Blowing hot air out the window creates negative pressure in the room, which sucks outdoor air back inside through various cracks.  In theory, dual-hose models avoid this problem by cooling the condenser with outdoor air, which is then re-exhausted.</p>
<p>However, when I feel the intake and exhaust hoses on the AP14001HS, the volume of air moving through the intake is considerably smaller, so air must be leaking from the room into the condenser compartment, and also between the room and outside while the blower is off.  There are two major locations where this happens:</p>
<ol>
<li>Where the bottom meets the front:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/bottom_gap.jpg" alt="bottom gap"></p>
<p>I sealed this one using tape:</p>
<p><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/bottom_gap_taped.jpg" alt="bottom gap taped"></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>On the back, below the air filter:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/filter_gap.gif" alt="filter gap"></p>
<p>To block this one, I cut a <strong>436mm x 98mm</strong> rectangle from a sheet of 1/16" (1.5mm) ABS plastic.  A cereal box also works for prototyping purposes... in general, the material needs to be pretty thin, but rigid enough to keep itself flat.</p>
<p>The plastic gets pulled toward the rear while the compressor is running, and toward the front otherwise, so a piece of tape can help hold it in place.</p>
<p>Finally, if you decide to open the unit (a 12-inch #2 Philips screwdriver is helpful), it's possible to tape over some internal hose/wiring gaps, but I'm not sure how important these are.</p>
<h3>Am I going to fry this thing?</h3>
<p>These modifications are intended to make the condenser compartment run hotter, which may shorten the life of some components, but I have no idea which ones or by how much.  I at least have a couple bits of evidence that this might not be a terrible idea:</p>
<ol>
<li>I asked EdgeStar support about sealing the bottom gap:</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Me]</strong></p>
<p>I recently purchased a couple EdgeStar AP14001HS dual-hose air
conditioners, and noticed that the intake hose moves quite a bit less
air than the exhaust hose. It seems that the extra air is "leaking"
into the condenser compartment where the bottom meets the front of the
unit. See the attached photo, where I temporarily covered the gap
with masking tape. Are you able to tell me whether this gap serves a
necessary function? Otherwise, I would rather leave it covered,
because I chose a dual-hose model to keep the inside/outside air
isolated from each other.</p>
<p><strong>[EdgeStar Guy]</strong></p>
<p>Hello Paul,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting EdgeStar support.</p>
<p>The area that you've taped up is considered an overflow release.
You are perfectly welcome to keep that area taped up though as it
shouldn't cause an issue.  My engineers have informed me that it's
OK to do this.</p>
<p><strong>[Me]</strong></p>
<p>Thank you.  I had suspected that the gap was to prevent the unit from
filling with water, though it seems bigger than necessary.</p>
<p>The AP14001HS specs say:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cooling Capacity (ASHRAE) 14000 BTU</li>
<li>Cooling Capacity (SACC) 8600 BTU (38% lower)</li>
</ul>
<p>According to this article, "infiltration air" is a major factor in
the SACC measurement:
<a href="https://support.edgestar.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005480926-What-is-SACC-Seasonally-Adjusted-Cooling-Capacity">https://support.edgestar.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005480926-What-is-SACC-Seasonally-Adjusted-Cooling-Capacity</a>-</p>
<p>Have your engineers evaluated what effect sealing this gap (and other
intake leaks) has on cooling efficiency?</p>
<p><strong>[EdgeStar Guy]</strong></p>
<p>Hello Paul,</p>
<p>Thank you for getting back to me.</p>
<p>I wasn't able to get an answer for this from my engineers about the
effect on sealing the gap will have on efficiency.  They did say that
when the units are tested, they are tested with this gap to produce that
SACC rating.  There's no modifications to the units done while testing.
The efficiency of the units includes the air gap.</p>
<p>It doesn't look like there has been factory level testing with the gap
sealed, but the engineers who work on these units have performed their
own tests and found covering this gap to not be an issue.
They weren't able to give me additional information on the SACC though
as it's not something we can test at this location.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<ol start="2">
<li>Someone on <a href="https://www.rollitup.org/t/modifying-portable-a-c-for-use-in-sealed-grow-room-w-co2-tutorial-w-pix.887831/">a plant-growing forum</a> reported sealing a Whynter ARC-143MX tightly enough to maintain a high-CO2 atmosphere.  It's not clear for what duration it actually ran, but the thread spans 4 years and the author doesn't mention a failure.</li>
</ol>
<p>So I wouldn't say that there's no risk of damage, but at least it's been tried before.</p>
<p>After sealing these gaps, I could feel more air moving through the intake port, and less air coming from the exhaust when I briefly obstruct the intake.</p>
<h3>Stand back, I'm going to try science</h3>
<p>In order to test these modifications, I installed the air conditioner in a somewhat-sealed closet with a 1.5m² volume.  I initialized the temperature to roughly 72°F, set the A/C to 61°F (the minimum value), and let it run for about 3 minutes until the blower shut off.</p>
<p>This was repeated 3 times in the factory configuration (red lines), 3 times with the gaps sealed (blue lines), and finally 2 times in "single hose mode" (black lines) with the intake sucking directly from the closet space.  I logged the temperature using a phone pointed at a thermometer, running Open Camera on 10-second repeat:</p>
<p><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/ap14001hs_open_sealed_graph.png" alt="open/sealed graph"></p>
<p>I don't think my setup is rigorous enough to calculate any absolute efficiency numbers, but clearly the sealed configuration does a better job of cooling, and single-hose mode is abysmal.</p>
<h3>Rant</h3>
<p>I find it disgraceful that the portable A/C companies are so clueless about efficiency that improvements can be made using basic household supplies.  This reminds me of the computer PSU industry before 80 Plus, where everything is garbage and nobody knows what to buy.  Why is all the innovation focused on single-hose designs?</p>
<p>Places like the Bay Area are full of apartments and condos that are gradually becoming unlivable as temperatures rise, so it would be nice if people could just throw money at a decent product.</p>
<p>It's possible that <a href="http://www.climax-air.com/">http://www.climax-air.com/</a> knows what they're doing, since they make (as far as I know in 2020) the only dual-hose portable with a variable-speed compressor.  But I've only looked at the website, since their supply is very limited.  Maybe I'll check again when the EdgeStars wear out.</p>
<h3>Photos of the closet setup</h3>
<p>(The second AP14001HS visible in the mirror was used to set the room temperature.)</p>
<p><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/closet1.jpg" alt="closet experiment 1">
<img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/closet2.jpg" alt="closet experiment 2"></p>
<h3>Building-related Notes</h3>
<p>Each unit consumes about 10.5 amps, so it's important to map out which circuit breakers feed which outlets, and avoid sharing a circuit with a high-drain appliance like a microwave or electric kettle.  Ideally, they should also sit on opposite legs of the main breaker.  So far, I've had no issues sharing a 15 amp circuit with a refrigerator or computer.</p>
<p>On a day that peaks around 95°F, two A/Cs running continuously can keep 850 sqft in the mid-70s.  My IR thermometer says the ceiling is considerably warmer than the walls, so it would probably be useful to improve the attic insulation.</p>
<p>I plan to run these in "heat" mode during the winter, which should consume less energy than the resistive baseboard heaters, but time will tell how well that works.</p>
<p>One caveat to this installation is that my windows are locked/taped into position, so I can't open them at night when the air is cooler outside.  It would be nice to have an automatic "ventilate" mode for this purpose.  However, an A/C cooled with cool air produces even colder air, so it doesn't need to spend much time running in this state.</p>
<h3>Simpler Hacks</h3>
<p>This unit blows indoor air mostly upwards.  I opened the case to remove the built-in deflector, and put a Frost King HD9 in its place. This creates a roughly-horizontal air stream, and also seems slightly quieter without those extra fins in the way.</p>
<p>(In this photo, note that I taped over the LEDs to reduce brightness, and the chunk of foam was from an abandoned soundproofing experiment involving repositionable adhesive.)</p>
<p><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/deflector.jpg" alt="deflector"></p>
<p>The hoses may be insulated using a 6 inch "tubular cotton stockinette bandage".  After 5 minutes of runtime with 2 layers of cotton, I measured 122°F at the hose and 102°F at the cotton surface.  This isn't the greatest insulating material, but it's cheap, easy, and looks reasonable enough.</p>
<p><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/stockinette.jpg" alt="stockinette"></p>
<p>You can rip open a standard furnace air filter, and cut the zig-zag part to fit the air intake's plastic frame.  Note that this will restrict airflow, so it probably makes sense to run the blower on high.  I increased the density a bit after taking this photo:</p>
<p><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/air_filter.jpg" alt="air filter"></p>
<h3>Soundproofing</h3>
<p>To make the unit run quieter, I started by wrapping it with a blanket, held in place using tape.  The hoses prevent anything from obstructing the room air intake.  Here is my "A/C burrito" prototype:</p>
<p><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/burrito_prototype.jpg" alt="burrito prototype"></p>
<p>With the unit running for hours when it's 90°F outside, the hottest point under the blanket is around 94°F, so it seems to do a reasonable job of keeping itself cool.</p>
<hr>
<p>For the improved version, I used mass loaded vinyl (MLV) wrapped in cotton blanket with velcro strips, held together using staples.</p>
<p>The cost of materials (for two copies) was roughly:</p>
<ul>
<li>4ft x 12.5ft roll of 1 pound/sqft MLV: $110</li>
<li>Two twin-size (66 x 90 inch) cotton blankets: $50</li>
<li>A few yards of 2 inch velcro: $10</li>
<li>Staples with 9/16 inch legs (Bostitch BTHT73533): $4</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the dimensions I used:</p>
<p><a href="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/mlv_burrito_dimensions.png"><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/mlv_burrito_dimensions.png" alt="mlv_burrito dimensions"></a></p>
<p>I cut the MLV to size using a tape measure, square, pencil, and scissors.  Removing the bottom corners leaves room for the power cord.  The wings have different lengths because the power cord is off-center.</p>
<p>There are velcro strips along the top (with opposing velcro hot-glued to the A/C), and on the back so the burrito can attach to itself.</p>

<p>What happened to the rebels of the financial revolution?</p>



<p>We’re starting this week with a quote from a piece by Ian Kar at <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fintechtoday.substack.com/" target="_blank">Fintech Today:</a></p>



<blockquote><p>In the first half of 2020, overhyped neobanks went from a contrarian opinion to a major industry talking point.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>What was just recently a contrarian opinion, is now stated as fact.</p>



<p>Just a couple of years ago, neobanks were spearheading the ‘financial revolution’, armed with a seemingly bottomless flow of venture capital.</p>



<p>Today, they’re largely out of the mainstream news cycle.</p>



<p>This week, we’re diving into the world of consumer fintech: Why did neobanks suddenly become so boring? What drove the hype cycle? Where did it go?&nbsp;</p>



<p>From there, the harder question: with the initial boom out of the way, what’s the long game for these banks?</p>



<p>We have a bunch to cover, so best get started!</p>



<h4>Cash Flows &amp; Sleek Logos</h4>



<p>Only about 2 years ago, every other week, news would break of a brand new neobank — seemingly out of nowhere — <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/one-a-new-digital-bank-aimed-at-the-middle-class-raises-17m-series-a/" target="_blank">raising</a> an 8 figure Series A, sending their CEO to speak at TechCrunch Disrupt to talk about their (very unique) company ‘values’, then hunkering down until it was Series B time.</p>



<p>Rinse, repeat.</p>



<p>Today, neobanks have reached almost meme status in tech and investing circles.</p>



<p>It quickly seemed like anyone and everyone could start a neobank. The space is extremely interesting. To get picky, almost none of the (US) neobanks are actual “banks” so to speak — they don’t store and insure client funds themselves, rather partnering with an FDIC licensed incumbent, serving as an intermediary.</p>



<p>The apparent relative ease to launch a neobank was an attractive sell for many new founders.</p>



<figure><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_725/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chrome_2020-07-23_23-20-21.png" data-src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_725/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chrome_2020-07-23_23-20-21.png" alt="" width="900" data-srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_725/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chrome_2020-07-23_23-20-21.png 725w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_300/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chrome_2020-07-23_23-20-21-300x66.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_700/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chrome_2020-07-23_23-20-21-700x154.png 700w" data-sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_725/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chrome_2020-07-23_23-20-21.png 725w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_300/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chrome_2020-07-23_23-20-21-300x66.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_700/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chrome_2020-07-23_23-20-21-700x154.png 700w"><figcaption>522,000 results!</figcaption></figure>



<p>While launching a mobile bank — especially in the US — involves an immense roll of red tape, regulation, and high bars to entry, it is far less complicated than launching a “traditional” financial institution.</p>



<p>Rapidly looking to ride the trend, card issuers — namely Visa and Mastercard — scrambled to be first pick to serve these new banks in offering debit cards. In the US neobank space today, Visa fights to hold its lead.</p>



<p>As such, it quickly became a relatively smooth process to issue debit card services once your online bank was established. To add to that, several other fintech infrastructure companies quickly popped up to supplement the growth of the space.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These ranged from the complex field of compliance (eg. <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://alloy.co/" target="_blank">Alloy</a>), interbank connections (eg. <a href="https://plaid.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Plaid</a>), and a bunch of under-the-hood services that were previously handled in-house by large banks, now being commoditized in the form of competing startups.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of this came together to form a space perfectly ripe for creating new challenger banks with attractive brand values, all aimed at “making your finances more transparent”, “dethroning the big banks”, etc.</p>



<p>To go with the shiny mission statement, you need a shiny product — and neobanks nailed the mark.</p>



<h4>Hype Cycles &amp; Making Banking Cool</h4>



<p>I’m a brand strategy guy at heart, so seeing Starling Bank’s <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.starlingbank.com/news/vertical-debit-card-launch/" target="_blank">announcement</a> of one of the first-ever vertical debit cards was a masterclass in brand differentiation. It had been tried before, but nothing had quite reached the mainstream.</p>



<figure><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_603/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PersonalBusinessDebitCards.9bd54d10.jpg" data-src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_603/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PersonalBusinessDebitCards.9bd54d10.jpg" alt="" width="900" data-srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_603/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PersonalBusinessDebitCards.9bd54d10.jpg 603w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_300/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PersonalBusinessDebitCards.9bd54d10-300x169.jpg 300w" data-sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px" srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_603/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PersonalBusinessDebitCards.9bd54d10.jpg 603w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_300/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PersonalBusinessDebitCards.9bd54d10-300x169.jpg 300w"></figure>



<p>Once Starling Bank made it ‘cool’, the vertical debit card and minimalistic design became&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;representation of mobile banks, quickly adopted by Venmo, N26, Revolut, and so many more.</p>



<p>This widespread aesthetic adoption, though, did little to help with the copycat, meme status beginning to plague banking startups.</p>



<p>Business strategy aside, you have to admit they look sleek…</p>



<p>In a space not exactly known for its innovative creativity, neobanks brought a fresh coat of (bold, matte) paint, both through the physical product, and user experience.</p>



<p>Brick and mortar banks have immense resources to outperform on features and depth, but this comes at the expense of simplicity. From design to product experience, neobanks solidified simplicity and minimalism as a top priority, with a heavy sprinkle of customer experience.</p>

<p>Armed with a beautiful product, a mission to make a boring field exciting and accessible, and a target market of mobile-first digital natives, the next step was to ramp up marketing spend. This was the not-so-secret sauce in bringing hype to the banking space.</p>



<p><a href="https://medium.com/@tejas_rd" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tejas Raut Dessai</a> put it best:</p>



<blockquote><p>The menu is simple — a checking account, a debit card, and a few other adjacent services. The modus operandi is somewhat simpler too, raise a ton of cash, hit the gas on marketing, grow deposits, and leverage the spread on income to fuel more marketing.</p></blockquote>



<p>Neobanks quickly took a page out of the DTC playbook and ran up paid social spend, with a focus balanced between brand building and user acquisition.</p>



<p>My Instagram Stories ads are the perfect proof of this, as is the London Underground.</p>

<p>If you’re a neobank, the hype train is now smoothly in motion.</p>



<p>User count is skyrocketing, all seems well. In fact, ARPU is even slowly rising as your neobank is slowly moving along the adoption cycle from early-adopters to the mainstream.</p>

<p>But now the problems are beginning to creep in.</p>



<p>Hypergrowth is brilliant,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://thistooshallpass.blog/when-you-come-at-the-king/" rel="noreferrer noopener">required, even,</a>&nbsp;in the months fresh off a funding round. The issue, though, is that hypergrowth is seldom sustainable — especially when it’s largely tied to ad spend.</p>



<p>That’s not to say that sustainable growth can’t be built on paid channels, rather that it’s a much more expensive and risky long-term play, relative to building out alternative, less expensive, and organic acquisition channels.</p>



<p>Neobanks have begun to fall out of the Silicon Valley spotlight as they now begin to build out more sustainable paths to growth — or profitability.</p>



<p>It’s the end of the beginning. Next step, prepare for the future.</p>



<h4>The Long Game</h4>



<p>The rise of the neobank in the US has been a relatively recent one, compared to the rest of the western world.</p>



<p>That doesn’t come as a huge surprise though. America has long <a href="https://thefinancialbrand.com/92575/banking-fintech-adoption-north-america-trends/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">lagged</a> Europe in terms of consumer financial infrastructure and product innovation. Corporate finance knows no better land, but consumer tech has fallen by the wayside.</p>



<p>While the rest of the world quickly adopted chip and pin, contactless payments, and instantaneous bank transfers, the US kept&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.ft.com/content/03a1f4b0-06d3-11e4-ba32-00144feab7de" rel="noreferrer noopener">mailing cheques</a>, swiping magnetic strips, and waiting 3-4 days for transfers.</p>



<p>This failure (refusal?) to modernize is largely why, until recently, almost all top neobanks were Europe-based.</p>



<p>US entrants are finally changing that, though. <a href="https://www.chime.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chime</a>, <a href="https://www.varomoney.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Varo</a>, and <a href="https://www.sofi.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">SoFi </a>are among the most recognizable neobank leaders today in the US, and quickly caught VC attention in the Bay Area.</p>



<p>Fast forward a couple of years to today, the widespread hype in tech and VC circles for neobanking is much more subdued.</p>



<p>This doesn’t mean neobanking itself has slowed down, though.</p>



<p>Beyond offering checking accounts and debit card services, fintech companies and neobanks are making moves up, and across the value chain.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Going Up</h4>



<p>As we touched on earlier, until very recently, there have been no US-based neobanks that hold an actual banking license, with regards to FDIC coverage. This means that no neobank had been approved to have client deposits insured by the US government.</p>



<p>For this reason, as we saw before, neobanks, upon launching, partner with a sponsor banking institution, one that&nbsp;<em>does</em>&nbsp;hold an FDIC license, and operates via their services.</p>



<p>This all changed when US-based neobank Varo, recently <a href="https://www.varomoney.com/press_release/fdic-approval-moves-varo-to-final-stage-of-bank-charter-journey/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> approval by the US government to be the first mobile bank to be granted FDIC approval. This marks a watershed moment in the fintech space, allowing the company to decouple from their sponsor bank (Bancorp) and vertically integrate a significant part of their value chain.</p>



<p>In offering independence from a partner institution, Varo will be able to bring all customer data in-house, and regain control over the cut of profits the partner bank would have otherwise claimed.</p>

<p>Though license integration is nothing new for neobanks on the international scene (lead competitors such as N26, Monzo, or Revolut all already hold EU-wide banking licenses), the move up the value chain is exciting news for US-based neobanks.</p>



<p>This brings me to a prediction: within the next 2 years, we’ll have seen the first US neobank IPO.</p>



<p>Through this lens, a bank charter is an attractive line item in an S-1.</p>



<h4>And Across</h4>



<p>Integrating operations away from a partner bank to in-house, though, brings with it a need for significant resource allocation to regulatory compliance. This is the expensive downside of integration,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://e.businessinsider.com/click/19418706.4/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9wcm9mZXNzaW9uYWwvYmxvZy9yaXNpbmctY29tcGxpYW5jZS1jb3N0cy1odXJ0aW5nLWN1c3RvbWVycy1iYW5rcy1zYXkv/5d233c18f730436f2414784fB9b8b3c6a" rel="noreferrer noopener">representing</a>&nbsp;costs to the tune of 6-10% of revenue.</p>



<p>For the many neobanks already hemorrhaging money, engaged in a vicious race to the bottom, working hard to avoid death by a thousand Instagram mid-rolls, the extra costs vertical integration brings makes little financial sense.</p>



<p>So, instead of looking up the value chain, as in the Varo example, many neobanks are exploring lateral moves.</p>



<p>We saw earlier how most of today’s neobanks began as online checking accounts. They then expanded to offering debit card services. Now, many players are looking further afield.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>I was never trained in music beyond some piano lessons as a child,
but I’ve always loved strange and interesting music and sounds.
For the last few months, I’ve been assembling a collection of patch cables
and circuit boards on my desk which, when connected just right,
can create anything from melodic sequences to fast, driving beats to
wacky electronic soundscapes.</p>

<p>This is a <strong>modular synthesizer</strong> in the Eurorack format.
Eurorack is a <a href="http://www.doepfer.de/a100_man/a100t_e.htm">de-facto standard</a>
created by German synthesizer manufacturer Doepfer designed around the concept of
voltage control. Everything in Eurorack is controlled through changing voltages,
from -10 to +10 volts, representing everything: audio, pitch, speed, slope,
and even <a href="https://www.modulargrid.net/e/doepfer-a-197-3-rgb-led-controller">color</a>.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/side-shot.jpg" alt="My synthesizer shot from an “aesthetic” angle.">
</figure>

<p>As I learn more about Eurorack and the modular ecosystem, it reminds me more and more
of the magical feeling of working with UNIX tools:
it is a world that exchanges programs for filters, oscillators, and VCAs,
text for voltage, and pipes for patch cables.</p>
<h2 id="text-audio-and-control-voltage">Text, Audio, and Control Voltage</h2>
<p>We’re all used to voltage representing audio.
An “AUX cord”, correctly called a 3.5mm TRS (tip, ring, and sleeve)
stereo cable<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>,
carries two channels of voltage and a common ground between audio devices through
a nearly universal<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> standard.
For audio signals, this voltage jumps between a maximum and minimum voltage.
Its value over time is eventually turned into the movement of a speaker or
headphone diaphragm, which in turn moves the air and can be heard.</p>
<p>In modular synthesis, though, we don’t just use these analog signals to represent the
movements of air that our ears hear as audio.
We also use them to control other parameters: pitch, for example.
Like the text streams that we use to move data around in UNIX tools,
or the JSON payloads that power a huge portion of the modern web,
voltage-based communication is simple but versatile.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/control-voltage.jpg" alt="A module in my synthesizer displaying the changes in control voltage representingpitch"></p>
<p>The micro-Ornament and Crime module displaying changing pitch values,
as represented by the voltage coming into its CV1 input.</p>

</figure>

<p>These voltages are, by their nature, analog -
there are infinitely many values between C4 and D4, or even between C4 and C#4.
Among other things, this means that complex microtonal music is not just possible,
but just as easy for the hardware to produce as music in any Western scale.</p>
<p>Text, of course, isn’t analog, but it does have similar characteristics.
It’s not always easy to parse or generate exactly the right text,
but with enough information, it’s always possible to interoperate with something
that uses a text interface, or even JSON structured data.</p>
<h2 id="oscillators-filters-grep-and-awk">Oscillators, Filters, <code>grep</code>, and <code>awk</code></h2>
<p>The traditional synthesizer, as invented by Bob Moog and co., produces sound
through a so-called <strong>subtractive</strong> process.
Sound, some kind of complex wave-form, is produced by an <strong>oscillator</strong>,
according to control voltage representing pitch.
That waveform, which has lots of harmonics, is put through an amplifier
which turns the sound on when a note is being played, and off when it is not,
and through a filter, which removes some harmonics and emphasizes others.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/threshold.jpg" alt="A Threshold module, outside of the synthesizer."></p>
<p>Just one module, removed from my synthesizer.
This is a four-oscillator retro digital voice, which produces three channels of
square waves and one “complex” waveform (noise, stepped triangle, etc.)</p>
<p>Each voice has four voltage inputs and one output, along with two buttons
and two knobs. The module also provides a “mixed” output.</p>

</figure>

<p>Of course, this is not so different from a standard UNIX log mangling pipeline,
where <code>cat</code> grabs some output from a file, <code>awk</code> formats it in some easy-to-work-with
way, <code>grep</code> cuts out irrelevant information, and <code>head</code>, <code>tail</code>, or a second <code>awk</code>
invocation formats the output.
This is the versatility of universal, standard interfaces like text, JSON, or voltage;
each tool does what it does, and interoperates cleanly.</p>
<h2 id="envelopes-signal-flow-and-mkfifo">Envelopes, Signal Flow, and <code>mkfifo</code></h2>
<p>In my rack, I have a simple signal flow mapped out by the sequence of modules.
My <a href="https://winterbloom.com/store/winterbloom-sol">Winterbloom Sol</a> turns digital
signals into control voltage.
The <a href="https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/kinks/">Kinks</a>,
<a href="https://pushermanproductions.com/product/jakplugg-open-source-pique-4hp-peaks-pcb-fr4-panel/">Pique</a>
and <a href="https://ornament-and-cri.me/">Ornament and Crime</a> modules shape that CV.
Then come two oscillators, a filter, a set of amplifiers, and some effects.</p>
<p>But that’s not necessarily the order I actually patch the signal chain.</p>
<p>Most synths have an “envelope” control, sometimes controlling the level of a signal,
and sometimes controlling a filter.
The magic of modular is that each of those components is discrete.
One module generates control voltage every time a note is played.
Another module (a <strong>voltage controlled amplifier</strong> or VCA) uses that control voltage
to change the volume of the note,
turning a rising voltage into attack and falling voltage into decay.
A third  module (a <strong>voltage controlled filter</strong>) uses that control voltage to change
the harmonic content of the sound. Just by moving a cable from the “FM” input to the
“Q” input, that filter can go from subtracting harmonics to emphasizing them,
or maybe both!</p>
<p>This is the flexibility of modular synthesis.
Every signal exists within a constrained realm, and every module manufacturer
knows what their interface should expect.
Each module does some transformation - in a sense, every module represents
a mathematical funtion, transforming voltage-over-time and knob positions
into voltage-over-time, which can itself be transformed by further modules.</p>
<p>This is not necessarily something we see often in UNIX programming -
but it is possible!
With <code>mkfifo</code>, we can create more complex data flows and unique ways of moving
information around, using multiple FIFOs as input and output files.
In web systems, this kind of many-way connection is very common;
even relatively simple systems like If This Then That allow users to create
long, wide, branching data flows, and even flows that contain cycles.
Ideally, each program or API does work like a mathematical function,
taking command line arguments and input and transforming them into
output and perhaps some side effects, like making a Mastodon post or
writing to disk or a database.</p>
<h2 id="modularity-open-source-and-market-forces">Modularity, Open Source, and Market Forces</h2>
<p>In the forward to  <em>The UNIX Time-Sharing System</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>,
the seminal 1978 paper on UNIX, Doug McIlroy articulates the philosophy of modularity
thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh.</li>
<li>Expect the output of every program to become the input of another, unknown,
program.</li>
<li>Design and build software […] to be tried early, ideally within weeks. <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>These are the same values that motivate the design of the best Eurorack modules.
Each module is easy to experiment with, designed to accomplish one or a few tasks,
explicitly built to integrate with other modules, and well-documented.</p>
<p>Eurorack’s modularity works well because there is no incentive to lock in users -
indeed, there is a significant disincentive, since no one small company
could ever hope to produce a universal product line.
Building modules that work well in as many systems as possible is the best way
to maximize sales.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/front-shot.jpg" alt="A front-on shot of my case, along with my Beatstep Pro controller"></p>
<p>My whole synthesizer is controlled by this Beatstep Pro, and optionally by Linux
software like 100r ORCA.</p>

</figure>

<p>Indeed, even in the cases where larger companies (like Intellijel) have tried to
invent their own standards to get at least some degree of lock-in revenue,
the size of the market limits the effectiveness of that strategy.
Their smaller, 1U form factor has been widely adopted, and there are now nearly
a dozen small manufacturers making compatible modules.</p>
<p>We, as software engineers, should strive to build software that is amenable to
interoperability, because that is the most effective way to support creativity.
Documented, open, and capable APIs are good, if your software must be centralized;
federation through open protocols is even better.</p>
<p>Critically, your interface does not need to be optimal.
Control voltage in 1v/Oct certainly isn’t; it requires difficult and imprecise
exponential conversion circuits, or slow and expensive floating point computations.
Consider, for instance, ActivityPub and the Mastodon ecosystem.
Eugen Rochko could have easily stuck with OStatus, which does have some advantages,
but the Mastodon project’s move to ActivityPub catalzyed an entire ecosystem,
with dozens of other microblogging products, as well as blogs, video sharing,
music sharing, and photo sharing software springing up, all able to interoperate
at least somewhat.</p>
<p>Modularity also promotes longevity.
The predecessor to <code>ls</code> was written in 1961<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>; the GNU <code>find</code> command has
history as far back as 1987<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. These programs are so deeply embedded in the brain
stem of computing that building a modern server operating system without something
compatible is nearly unthinkable.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/open-source.jpg" alt="Another side shot of my synthesizer."></p>
<p>Every module in this photograph is open source - software and hardware.</p>

</figure>

<p>I should also point out that, while free and open source software is,
in my opinion, a moral good,
software freedom and open protocols/interfaces are tangential concerns.
While many Eurorack modules are open source, some of the most popular are not;
for example, Make Noise’s analog computer Maths is not an open source design,
but it is the heart of many modular systems because it integrates well into
the ecosystem and has a clearly documented and well-specified interface.</p>
<p>Amazon’s Simple Storage Service, for instance, is a proprietary service with an open
protocol, and it is hugely successful - so much so that many projects have sprung up
to implement its interface, and a huge volume of cloud software is designed to work
with “S3 - and other stuff that works the same.”</p>
<p>Modularity is the most direct path to innovation. As software engineers,
we should do our absolute best, both technically and politically, to build
programs that do one thing well,
programs that can be tried early,
and programs that work well together.
Anything else guarantees stagnation, lock-in, frustration, and eventual obscurity.</p>

Do not compare yourself or your code to others. <strong>This is a quickest way to hating your work</strong>.</p><h2><a name="you-must-write-garbage-code-first" href="#you-must-write-garbage-code-first" id="you-must-write-garbage-code-first" title="Anchor Link"></a>You must write garbage code first</h2><p>The worst thing you can do is take on a massive project in the beginning. When I was a wee lad, I loved the movie the Social Network. The movie revolved around Mark Zuckerberg starting Facebook from his college dorm room. I would get so inspired after watching that I would proclaim to my friends, “I”m going to build the next Facebook!”. Then I would open up my <del>pirated</del> copy of Adobe DreamWeaver and pretend to know was doing. </p><p><img src="https://media1.tenor.com/images/cedc741cbcef0b97cc652ad9cb29d0ad/tenor.gif?itemid=13969571" alt="People from the Social Network   movie staring at computer" title="Rare footage of me in 2009 having no idea what I'm doing"></p><p>At the time, I did not know much html. And the only css I knew was how to the change the color of text. But I was going to write the next Facebook.</p><h4>Spoiler Alert: <em>I didn’t write the next Facebook</em>.</h4><p>The truth is, Facebook was <strong>not</strong> Zuckerberg’s first website. He was already an experienced programmer by the time he started Facebook. And no one talks about the projects he made before he got to Harvard. That’s an important thing to remember, your first projects are going to suck and no one but you will want to use them. And that’s okay!</p><p>In the game development community, there is a common piece of advice given to beginners. “Don’t write an MMO as your first game”. It's not surprising that aspiring gamedevs come into the field wanting to create the games they enjoy playing. This advice is not meant to be discouraging. What said is that you have to crawl before you can walk. If you dediate yourself to a huge project early on, you will become overwhemled and burn out.</p><p>But if you accept that your first works will suck, you will grow and learn what you can do. The faster you get past the sucky bits, the faster you get to the <em>not so bad</em> parts.</p><h2><a name="programming-is-a-change-in-mindset" href="#programming-is-a-change-in-mindset" id="programming-is-a-change-in-mindset" title="Anchor Link"></a>Programming is a change in mindset</h2><p>Learning to program is not about learning how to use the latest Javascript libraries. Its not about learning how binary works (Though that’s not a bad path). Its not even about learning a language . Learning to program is an entire shifting of the way you think.</p><p><img src="https://media1.tenor.com/images/5505bcb204761c1f9c979a085d5fd4ec/tenor.gif?itemid=8390287" alt="The Matrix" title="At a certain point, you don't even see what normal people see looking at code"></p><p>Here’s the thing about computers. Computers are purely logical. A computer will do what it's told. A computer knows only the information its given. If your program is not doing something you want, this means you need to step through how the computer is interpreting what's being told.</p><p>This can be a foreign concept for some. You have to think like a computer. People who tend to be better at math pick up programming a bit quicker. For me, I am not naturally good at math, so this took me a long time to grasp.</p><h2><a name="experienced-programmers-question-their-expertise-all-of-the-time" href="#experienced-programmers-question-their-expertise-all-of-the-time" id="experienced-programmers-question-their-expertise-all-of-the-time" title="Anchor Link"></a>Experienced programmers question their expertise all of the time</h2><p>To this day I still question if I am an imposter and I have been programming for over 10 years. At my new job, they are using a framework I was not familiar with. I had a difficult time trying to understand the way the framework wants me to use it. No matter how many languages or framework you learn, you will always have moments like these.</p><figure>

  </figure><p>There is always a period of time where you are typing code you don't fully understand. Then there will be an "aha!" moment where it all makes sense.  This is called the <em>click</em>. Sometime it takes weeks or months to get there. We all have to go through it. You are not dumb, it just has not clicked for you yet.</p><p>Programming is more about the ability to love learning than it is about remembering what you have learned. If you hate learning new things, you will have a hard time in this field.

This page provides links to digitised versions of old maths textbooks. All the books listed here are available to view for free online. There are probably thousands of old maths textbooks online, so this list is by no means exhaustive. Note that I have mainly listed algebra and arithmetic books (rather than geometry books) because that's my area of interest.</p><p>

<p>There’s always been a considerable level of criticism against Java from a big sector of our industry; this criticism has been mostly focused on Java’s <strong>verbosity and the amount of boilerplate code it generates</strong> in many cases without need. Although I’ve always liked Java, I couldn’t say that these allegations are wrong; it’s indeed true that Java’s verbosity and its amount of clutter could become very annoying in multiple occasions. Although most of the times we have to accept that we don’t live in a perfect world and in most of the cases we have to accept the lesser of two evils. So yes, Java wasn’t perfect, we all know that, but the main question is why nothing was done before to address these concerns.</p>



<p>In my personal opinion, the only reason why changes took so long is because there wasn’t enough competition for Java, things were right as they were. <strong>Java language was dominating the market probably due to the lack of serious competitors</strong> and due to the big efforts made by Sun first and then Oracle afterwards.</p>



<p><strong>The strong type safety provided by Java and some of its characteristics as a well-structured language made it a very popular language for big projects</strong>; by using Java it’s generally more difficult to get things really out of hand. Also one of the main characteristics of Java, being a multi platform language which runs on its own virtual machine, made it a perfect match for many organisations. If you add its inherent capability of performing automatic performance optimisations through its famous JIT compiler, something that minimises in many cases the effects of badly-written code, then you have a pretty solid set of reasons to use Java.</p>



<p>But then what happened? What happened is that new languages able to run in the same JVM as Java were introduced into the market; languages that were eliminating some of the biggest annoyances in Java and offering a nicer environment to developers with quite a flat learning curve in some cases.</p>



<p>Before we continue let’s recapitulate and take a brief tour through the history of JVM languages!</p>



<h2>History of JVM languages</h2>



<p>Once thing I’d like to clarify before we start, is that I’ve skipped some of the existing JVM languages mainly because they never got enough traction to be considered candidates to be used widely in our industry. Having said that, let’s kick off our quick tour thorough JVM languages history!</p>







<p>To start with our tour we have to start with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Java</a> of course, the oldest and most popular language in the JVM world.<br><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Java</a> was officially released in January 1996</strong>, so it’s been around for twenty-four years already; not bad, eh? Initially Java was a purely imperative language following a purely object-oriented programming style; also being a strongly typed language.  Java’s syntax is similar in some way to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B" target="_blank">C++</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)" target="_blank">C</a> languages, but it’s considered an improved version because it’s much easier to write code with Java than C or C++. On the other hand, we have that the biggest argument among its detractors is its verbosity.</p>



<p>The second JVM language that was released was <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://groovy-lang.org/" target="_blank">Groovy</a>; it started being around since 2003, although <strong>it’s first official and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Community_Process" target="_blank">standardised</a> version 1.0 didn’t come up until January 2007</strong>. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://groovy-lang.org/" target="_blank">Groovy</a> had the benefit of being able to be <strong>used as a scripting language as well</strong>. Groovy is a <strong>dynamically typed language</strong>, so type checks occur at runtime; this is one of the reasons why some developers don’t like Groovy. You write your code in Groovy, it looks correct on compilation time but then on runtime is when you realise that there’s something  wrong.</p>







<p>A very popular language for a few years came up next, we’re talking about <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.scala-lang.org/" target="_blank">Scala</a>. <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.scala-lang.org/" target="_blank">Scala</a> was officially released in 2004</strong> and it brought <strong>a new programming model to the JVM world with functional programming</strong> and its declarative approach. We could affirm that Scala was the first to bring this concept of immutability that we’ve talked about before, so it has done very good things for the Java transformation. On the other hand, Scala detractors don’t like it due to its complex grammar and in general low readability.</p>







<p>The next language to make its appearance in the JVM world was <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://clojure.org/" target="_blank">Clojure</a>, a purely functional language that is becoming quite popular recently but it <strong>first appeared in 2007</strong>. Clojure is a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)" target="_blank">LISP</a> based language characterised by its simplicity and the use of pure functions. Among its drawbacks we could mention that it’s dynamically typed (same as Groovy) and the learning curve is much steeper, as its syntax is completely different from other JVM languages. There are a couple of good books that you should read if you’re interested in learning <strong><em>Clojure</em></strong>: “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://geni.us/hurUc7p" target="_blank">The joy of Clojure</a>” and “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://geni.us/7azovHB" target="_blank">Programming Clojure: 3rd Edition</a>“.</p>







<p>And lastly but not least we have <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://kotlinlang.org/" target="_blank">Kotlin</a>! <strong>Kotlin</strong> was first released in <strong>February 2016 </strong>and since then it hasn’t stopped growing in popularity. It was designed by the company <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/" target="_blank">JetBrains</a> with one clear goal: eliminate all the  most popular Java problems. In the way it’s been designed <strong>it has kept all the good things about Java </strong>but at the same time <strong>eliminating the majority of its problems</strong>; that’s why it’s becoming so popular and many consider that it could defeat Java in the next few years. If you want to know more about <strong><em>Kotlin</em></strong> (I encourage to do so, as it’s a great language), I’d recommend that you read the book <a href="https://geni.us/f4BI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Kotlin in Action”</a>, a fantastic book to start with <strong><em>Kotlin</em></strong> for Java developers.</p>

<p>So this are the most important JVM languages, we have skipped some others that are not so popular but we could mention some of them: <strong>Jython, JRuby, Ceylon, Fantom, et</strong>c. You can check the whole list of the existing JVM languages <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_JVM_languages" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>



<p>One thing that we could notice is that <strong>Java didn’t have much competitors in the first eight or ten years</strong> but since then it started having some competition; so is having competition good or bad?</p>



<h2>Benefits of increased competition</h2>



<p>As we mentioned earlier, Java hadn’t changed too much in its early years probably because there was no need for it; the language was widely used and very popular despite of being far from perfect.</p>



<p>But then new competitors showed up, more modern languages that were bringing new features and solving some of the pain points that Java developers had been suffering for a long time.</p>



<p>For instance, let’s look at <strong><em>Scala</em></strong> language; Scala’s popularity was increasing since 2009, developers were welcoming this new functional style that allowed them more flexibility and also write parallel code safely and easily. We can see this trend in the following Google Trends graph:</p>

<p>What was Oracle’s reaction to this new trend? Java Lambdas and Streams were released in 2014. I think we can all agree that at that point was when Java made its biggest step to defeat Scala; everyone who currently works in the industry can feel that lose of steam that Scala has been suffering in the recent years.</p>



<p>One more benefit in having more competitors in the JVM world is the <strong>continuous improvements that JIT compiler and the JVM itself are experiencing.</strong> Now there are much more people interested in having an optimised JVM and improved performance optimisations. So competition has been a good thing for everyone!</p>



<p>The last competitor to appear in the arena has been <strong><em>Kotlin</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Kotlin</em></strong> has been very important because in some way it has shown Oracle the way to go forward. <strong><em>Kotlin</em></strong> has shown that it’s possible to keep the good parts of Java but creating a more concise and fast to code language.</p>



<p>If we look at Google Trends to see how popular has Kotlin been in the last  few years this is what we have:</p>

<p>So it seems that Kotlin became quite popular fairly quickly but it seems to be settling down in the last couple of years.</p>



<p>Oracle has taken good notes of the industry’s reactions with regards to Kotlin and if you take a look at the JDK 15 release notes, you can see that some of the Java new features are basically copies of what Kotlin had changed. For example, the <strong><em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/359" target="_blank">new Java records</a></em></strong>, the new <strong><em>text blocks</em></strong> (multi-line string with triple quotes) or the new <strong><em>switch</em></strong> statement; which is more or less a copy of Kotlin <strong><em>when</em></strong> statement. You can take a look at JDK 15 release notes <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://jdk.java.net/15/release-notes" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>



<p>All of this we’ve talked about is what I call <strong>“The Kotlinisation of Java”</strong>; by becoming its stronger competitor in its history, Kotlin has shown Java the way to go. From my point of view Kotlin has been the only language I’ve seen that could overcome Java as a leader in our industry.</p>



<h2>The “Kotlinisation” of Java</h2>



<p>Some of the upcoming Java features are going to be a massive improvement for Java in terms of readability and in terms of improving one of the main weaknesses in Java, its verbosity. We could affirm that they all have <strong>a suspicious similarity with some Kotlin features</strong>.</p>



<p>Please keep in mind that most of these features are <strong>feature previews</strong>, what means that if you install JDK 14 or JDK 15 when it gets released, <strong>you won’t be able to use them by default.</strong></p>



<p>Java feature previews are new features that are introduced in a release but are disabled by default; they’re <strong>included in the release just to gather feedback from the community of developers</strong>, so they’re <strong>still subject to changes</strong> and that’s why it’s not recommend to use them in production code.</p>



<p>To enable them at compilation time you’d have to do the following:</p>



<pre><code>javac --enable-preview --release 14</code></pre>



<p>If you want to enable them at runtime you’d have to run the following:</p>



<pre><code>java --enable-preview YourClass</code></pre>



<p>Of course, you can also enable them in your IDE, but <strong>be careful to not enable previews by default</strong> in all your new projects!</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at those changes that are going to have a bigger impact on our coding with future versions of Java!</p>



<h4>Java records</h4>



<p>Java records are a feature that many of us have been demanding for a long time; I guess you’ve been in the same situation multiple times, when you reluctantly have to implement <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#toString--" target="_blank">toStri…</a></p></div></div>

        <p>Better living through reliability.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://sre-blog.com/2020-07-29-base-alerts.html">Base Alerts</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://sre-blog.com/2020-07-29-base-alerts.html">2020-07-29</a></p>
<p>
As we migrated from host base alerts to application alerts with
Prometheus, devs asked which alerts they should implement. A reasonable
question. The common and (in my opinion) not super useful answer are the <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/monitoring-distributed-systems/">Four
Golden Signals</a>.
The golden signals, while technically correct, remain open to
interpretation which is friction to understanding.
</p>

<p>
So instead I'll give you the list of alerts you should have for every
production service (in alphabetical order):
</p><ul>
  <li>CPUUsageTooHigh</li>
  <li>DiskUsageTooHigh</li>
  <li>FileDescriptorsTooHigh</li>
  <li>GoroutinesTooHigh</li>
  <li>JVMHeapUsageTooHigh</li>
  <li>MemoryUsageTooHigh</li>
  <li>PodContainerRestarting</li>
  <li>ProbeFailing</li>
  <li>ProcessCrashlooping</li>
  <li>ProcessCrashloopingSlowly</li>
  <li>Server500sTooHigh</li>
  <li>ServerLatencyTooHigh</li>
  <li>TaskDown</li>
  <li>TooManyTasksDown</li>
</ul>


<p>
These come out of experience running distributed systems from several prior
companies. Now one might argue that some of these are redundant or not
applicable to certain circumstances, and you'd be right! But if you're arguing
with me about nuance, then I've done my job to provide enough of a framework
for you to build on and mold to your specific needs.
</p>

<p>
In future posts, we'll expand on each of these, explaining why each is useful,
what each intends to catch, what types of services might not need these alerts,
etc.

<h2 id="johannes-can-you-tell-us-a-little-how-you-got-started-with-electric-vehicles">Johannes, can you tell us a little how you got started with electric vehicles?</h2>

<p>It started in 2008. I graduated from University with a degree in Computer Science and electrical engineering. I always had a knack for this stuff, soldering, the hardware part and also some software. The initial motivation was that I was probably going to have to commute and just thinking that I would turn on my diesel car every day…It smells terrible in the morning when it is a cold start, it pollutes the city… it felt so wrong. This is what got me into electric traction.</p>

<p>I thought about a go-kart, but that didn’t seem like a good idea. Taking the bike was a lot more practical in the end, but it sparked the idea of EV conversions. The second motivation was purely technical, <strong>I found it intriguing that you can control these large powerful motors with a few lines of code and control very precisely what it can do</strong>… That’s fascinating.</p>

<p>I started with the controller code that was about forty lines of code. It was enough to spin the motor, of course, code started to grow as it got better. At the start I blew up some components, but amazingly little, thankfully after that not too much. From there on, I spent time after work and persisted on it over years. The first conversion rolled out in 2012/13, roughly 5 years after I started.</p>

<h2 id="why-open-and-free-software-and-hardware">Why open and free software and hardware?</h2>

<p>I set up an electric car forum where I published the results of my experiments. At some point I was confident that what I built could be used by other people.</p>

<p>At the time. I was a Linux person and I liked the idea of open source, as opposed to Intellectual property. <strong>Hiding or being secretive, I never liked that. So, I decided to start something similar, but for automotive motor control</strong>.</p>

<p>At the time, AC motor control was considered something very complicated that only specialist companies would be able to manage. I wanted to show people that it is not that hard and I wanted people to be able to use these superior AC motors. The code was a great way to achieve that.</p>

 <figcaption>First prototype.</figcaption></figure>

<h2 id="why-are-ac-motors-superior">Why are AC Motors superior?</h2>

<p>DC motors have large mechanical components. Many properties of the dynamics of the DC motor control are managed mechanically. They cannot be controlled by software precisely. It’s hard to transfer energy back into the battery with DC motors. They wear out because of the moving parts. But, AC motors don’t have these problems and they can be precisely controlled. And I mean, there’s no production costs.</p>

<h2 id="so-you-got-the-project-off-the-ground-what-happened-then">So you got the project off the ground, what happened then?</h2>

<p>I decided to go open source with both hardware and software. Around that time I came across an open source charger project. I learned a lot from that project, there were many things that I thought didn’t need to be there. It made me focus on how to improve my own designs. It also made me think that perhaps I needed to create a kit.</p>

<p>Soon after, I noticed what <a href="http://coders4climatestrike.com/2020/06/a-community-that-converts-cars-to-electric-part-2-damien-maguire-interview.html">Damien</a> was doing. I was fascinated by the way he had been doing things and by his enthusiasm. I have to admit, I was very proud when he contacted me to get one of the my kits. He was one of the first people to inquire about it. He set it up online on his YouTube channel. I was very happy to be in contact with Damien. This is a relationship that’s been growing ever since. The designs are open source, so he took the design and adjusted it to use the Tesla motors. <strong>The rest is history. It’s a lot of back and forth between us. I took his ideas and put them back into my design and it’s just very much open source is supposed to work.</strong></p>

<h2 id="i-guess-that-is-how-open-inverter-came-about-then-or-is-it-a-collection-of-things">I guess that is how Open Inverter came about then, or is it a collection of things?</h2>

<p>It has become a collection. Initially, Open Inverter was just one inverter.</p>

<p>One of the main problems to bridge at the time was how to make your car road legal. If you pick some random motor and build your own inverter you can end up spending a lot of time and money testing to get the car approved and road legal.</p>

<p>The next development was that big car manufacturers like: Nissan, VolksWagen and Tesla started making electric cars, and those electric costs were crashing. <strong>With this, we have available high quality parts. Those parts are road legal qualified motors. This means that one of the main blockers for car conversions has been lifted! A massive win!</strong> With all the legal issues gone this is a big push for recycling and making conversions easier.</p>

<h2 id="these-oem-parts-are-from-hybrid-electric-only-or-both">These OEM parts are from hybrid, electric only, or both?</h2>

<p>It can be from any of them. We started with a few electric components. The first was an OEM drive chain of a Tesla.  Nowadays we are looking into hybrids more because it’s so much cheaper. If you go out and buy a Tesla part, it will set you back by about 5000 euros. If you go out and buy a somewhat equivalent hybrid drive, you can get it for about 200, 300 euros. Another large barrier to EV conversions removed.</p>

<h2 id="i-get-the-sense-that-youre-really-into-democratising-this-is-that-so">I get the sense that you’re really into democratising this. Is that so?</h2>

<p>Most definetly! I was inspired by the Steve Jobs biography and some articles where they describe how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak">Steve Wosniak</a> worked. For example when he got a $100 per part, he didn’t use all the budget on it. He shrunk the design to the very essence of what was necessary.</p>

<p>What I aim for is: <strong>not much there that doesn’t need to be there</strong>. I do not use expensive components because of fancy data sheets. Do not use many components that are supposedly superior. What’s the point in measuring the current with 0.1% accuracy If all you need is like 5% .</p>

<h2 id="so-that-gets-us-to-the-last-few-years-what-has-been-happening">So that gets us to the last few years, what has been happening?</h2>

<p>In 2016 I registered the domain for <a href="http://coders4climatestrike.com/2020/07/openinverter.org">Open Inverter</a>. The idea was to create a platform for this ecosystem.  Not much happened for two years, but then a guy called Demare Deokman from Canada suggested we make a forum. We also added a Wiki and a shop. Before that people had to email me to request the different parts.</p>

<p>Then I started the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/openinverter">patreon page</a>, so that people could support my “artisanal engineering” work.  I hope it might become self-sustaining soon. If that happens I can spend all my time on this improving on the hardware and software.</p>

<h2 id="what-happens-when-people-order-a-part-from-open-inverter">What happens when people order a part from Open Inverter?</h2>

<p>The process starts with getting the correct parts ordered, then I put it together, load the software to it, do some test procedures.I try to be as complete as possible, so people don’t have to go out and shop for something else when they get the kits. Follow the link for more info on the features of the <a href="http://johanneshuebner.com/quickcms/index.html%3Fen_features,8.html">Inverter Kit</a></p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-blocker-for-more-car-conversions-to-electric">What is the blocker for more car conversions to electric?</h2>

<p><img src="http://coders4climatestrike.com/img/2020-johannes/Touran--electric-transaxle.jpg" width="400" alter="Touran conversion electric transaxle"></p>

<p>The main blocker is education. If you start off knowing nothing it’s hard to collect information. We’re trying to solve that, but it’s a long road. It would be ideal to know, given a car you want to convert: What parts would be suitable? What work needs to be done, What mechanical adaptations?</p>

<p>Deleting misinformation would be good too. There are a lot of rumors out there that might keep people from even thinking about doing a car conversion. Some examples are around lithium batteries and how their usage erases the environmental benefits of an EV.  Another one is more practical, on how to make sure your car conversions are road legal without huge costs.</p>

<p><img src="http://coders4climatestrike.com/img/2020-johannes/Touran--fossil-removal.jpg" width="400" alter="Touran conversion"></p>

<h2 id="since-you-are-enabling-car-conversions-do-you-have-it-in-your-plans-to-create-a-car-conversion-company">Since you are enabling car conversions, do you have it in your plans to create a car conversion company?</h2>

<p><strong>I wouldn’t. I see my work more like an ISO layer. It would be great if my work could enable others to run such a business.</strong> I think car conversions will eventually become more mainstream than they currently are. There are a lot of conversion shops in Germany but they have to charge ridiculous money to get the job done, it’s such custom work.</p>

<p>Every car is a new project. Standardising the conversions would make sense because it has certain advantages over buying a new electric car: the environmental impact is lower, parts already exist, also, you can customise certain aspects of the car to suit your needs better.  <strong>There are some very good chassis out there, that just have the wrong engine</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://coders4climatestrike.com/img/2020-johannes/Touran--body-work-with-Arber.jpg" width="400" alter="Touran conversion body work with Arber"></p>

<h2 id="speaking-of-debunking-myths-is-it-expected-that-i-would-lose-the-back-seats-if-i-convert-a-car">Speaking of debunking myths, is it expected that I would lose the back seats if I convert a car?</h2>

<p>Maybe that would have been true with my first conversion many years ago, the <a href="http://johanneshuebner.com/quickcms/index.html%3Fen_electric-car-conversion,6.html">92 Polo</a>, the battery weighted 250 kilograms. However, with nowadays technology I could probably fit most of the batteries in front and wouldn’t lose them.</p>

<h2 id="are-there-any-interesting-integration-plans-for-open-inverter">Are there any interesting integration plans for Open Inverter?</h2>

<p>It is in the plans to have some sort of standard so that other systems, like Open Vehicles can use the information Open Inverter provides such as motor temperature, motor speed, etc. This is a significant amount of work but I think it would be very useful</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><article><p>A few years ago I splurged on an exercise bike. It’s a pretty expensive
item imho, both in upfront and ongoing subscription costs. But I was able
to justify it by riding it all the time so that per-ride it wasn’t that
expensive. I’m happy to say this was a huge boon for my fitness and it
was worth every penny.</p><p>The bike is the Flywheel Home Bike by Flywheel Sports. You open up the app,
pick a class, and start riding. The app shows you a live video stream of an
instructor, your position on the leaderboard so you can compete with the
other people in the class, and your realtime stats like power (watts) and
cadence (rpm). There’s all the usual motivational badges that come with
fitness apps these days, and each ride is logged so you can track your
progress over time.</p><p>Or, that’s how it used to work anyway.</p><p>Flywheel recently and abruptly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21144268/flywheel-digital-classes-shut-down-peloton-exercise-trade-in">shut down</a> the Home Bike service following a legal battle with their competitor, Peloton. The bike does still work in that you can still pedal and adjust the resistance and technically get a workout. But the app is no longer so there are no classes, no competition, and no stats.</p><p>Flywheel customers left wanting a bit more had a few options:</p><ol><li>Swap it for a free refurbished Peloton. Join Peloton for the same monthly fee and take their classes instead. Not a bad deal and arguably an upgrade.</li><li>Use the free <a href="https://lifefitness.com/icg-digital-experience/training-app">LifeFitness ICG Training App</a>. The Flywheel Home Bike is a rebranded LifeFitness IC5 so it just happens to work with this app. This gives you live stats like power and cadence and the ability to track your progress but doesn’t provide any live classes or competition, nor is it officially supported.</li><li>Add a set of power meter pedals ($). Use the bike with the massively-multiplayer online cycling simulator <a href="https://www.zwift.com/">Zwift</a> and other training apps.</li><li>Reverse engineer the bike. Set its data free to be used with Zwift and other training apps. No power meter pedals required.</li></ol><p>The rest of the post is a walk-through of my experience writing some code that enables the Flywheel Home Bike to work with Zwift and other training apps. It likely also works for the LifeFitness IC5 and support for other bikes should be easy to add.</p><p>The finished program is called <a href="https://github.com/ptx2/gymnasticon">Gymnasticon</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ptx2/gymnasticon">the code</a> is open-source on GitHub.</p><h3 id="project-goals">Project goals</h3><p>The primary goal is to make the Flywheel Home Bike work with Zwift. It would be great if it also works with other cycling apps like TrainerRoad and Rouvy.</p><p>The solution should be easy to use for a non-developer and non-destructive to the bike.</p><p>The plan to get there is broken down into 3 parts:</p><ol><li>Write some code to get power and cadence data out of the bike’s proprietary protocol</li><li>Write some code to send power and cadence data to Zwift emulating a Bluetooth bike</li><li>Put the two together into a final working solution</li></ol><h3 id="part-1---getting-data-out-of-the-bike">Part 1 - Getting data out of the bike</h3><p>Only two pieces of information are needed to make a bike work with Zwift: power (watts) and cadence (rpm). Power enables Zwift to calculate your speed and position in the game. Cadence improves the experience of cadence-based workouts and enables Zwift to accurately animate your character.</p><p>We know from experience that this bike is capable of producing that information and that it communicates with the official Flywheel app using Bluetooth so the first step
is to open up a Bluetooth service explorer and see what’s available.</p><figure><video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" src="https://ptx2.net/posts/unbricking-a-bike-with-a-raspberry-pi/videos/clip4_bluetility.mp4" alt="Bluetility on macOS shows the services offered by the Flywheel Home Bike." width="100%"></video><figcaption><p><a href="https://github.com/jnross/Bluetility">Bluetility</a> on macOS shows the services offered by the Flywheel Home Bike.</p></figcaption></figure><p>The bike advertises a single service with two characteristics (aka data values). A web
search for the service UUID tells us this is <a href="https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/include/bluetooth/services/nus.html">Nordic UART Service</a> which
is a custom service defined by Nordic Semiconductor. It allows sending
arbitrary data back and forth, emulating a serial port.</p><p>The characteristics are named from the bike’s perspective. To transmit
data to the bike we write to the receive (RX) characteristic. To receive data
from the bike we subscribe to the transmit (TX) characteristic.</p><p>Clicking subscribe on the (TX) characteristic shows that the bike is already sending some data. It is a bit hard to see the data here though. The short JavaScript program below uses the <a href="https://github.com/abandonware/noble">noble</a> Bluetooth client library to connect to the bike and dump all the received data to the console so we can begin to analyze it.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>/**

<p>You’ve probably heard the word eigenvectors hundreds of times in class and have been asked to calculate it hundreds more. But why is this concept so central in Linear Algebra? Why is it that we study the eigenvector of a matrix so often?</p>

<p>In this post, we’ll see how Eigenvectors help us immediately understand what a linear function will do to an input. We’ll do so by playing with an interactive visualization that allows us to see just that.</p>

<h3 id="quick-refresher">Quick Refresher</h3>

    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_scaling.png" width="300">
    Here, applying <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> on its eigenvector <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> leades to a new vector <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>λ</mi><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is in the same direction as <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. Image Source: Wikipedia.
</p>

<p>Let’s do a quick refresher to begin with. The eigenvector of a linear function A is just the vector <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> s.t. <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>v</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>λ</mi><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">Av = \lambda v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> for some constant <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>λ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> which we call the eigenvalue. At a high level, the eigenvector is just a dimension along which the linear function only stretches its input (for real valued eigenvalues).</p>

<p>This is great and all but what can we do once we find an Eigenvector? What does it tell us about the underlying Matrix?</p>

<h3 id="linear-functions-pull-inputs-towards-the-dominant-eigenvector">Linear Functions Pull Inputs Towards the Dominant Eigenvector</h3>

<p>Let’s start with an example. Take the following linear function:</p>

<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">[</mo><mtable><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>4</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">]</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A = \begin{bmatrix}3 &amp; 2 \\ 1 &amp; 4\end{bmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>

<p>Let’s see what happens when we apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> repeatedly on the input <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mrow><mo fence="true">[</mo><mtable><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">]</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>


    
    
    




<p>To play with this visualization, do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Drag the slider to increase the number of times we apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</li>
  <li>Notice how the output vector tilts towards <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v_1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, an eigenvector of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</li>
</ol>

<p>So just by knowing an eigenvector of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> (namely the dominant eigenvector), we can get a sense of what <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> does -  <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> <strong>pulls</strong> its input towards the axis of the dominant eigenvector.</p>

<p>How is this happening? And why is it only towards one eigenvector?</p>

<h3 id="breaking-up-the-input-with-an-eigenbasis">Breaking Up the Input With an Eigenbasis</h3>

<p>You’ll be surprised to see that this behavior comes very naturally from the properties of linear functions.  Let’s see this with an example.</p>

<p>Let’s keep the same matrix/linear function <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">[</mo><mtable><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>4</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">]</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A = \begin{bmatrix}3 &amp; 2 \\ 1 &amp; 4\end{bmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, and analyze applying <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> three times on the input <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">[</mo><mtable><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">]</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> (i.e. <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>).</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_pull/standard_flow.png">
    In the standard way, we'd just use standard matrix multiplication to find <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mi>v</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>
</p>

<p>The standard way to do this is to simply follow the rules of multiplication and carry out <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>v</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A(A(A(v))).</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> But instead, let’s do this a different way using eigenvectors.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_pull/split_flow.png">
    In the following discussion we will split <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> into a linear combination of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>'s eigenvectors. We then apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> to each of these pieces and combine the result.
</p>

<p>We know that that any vector <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> can be written as the sum of the eigenvectors of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. After all, eigenvectors are linearly independent and form a basis for the space (if the matrix <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is diagonalizable, which it is). If <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v_1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v_2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> are the eigenvectors of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A,</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> we can break up <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> as:</p>

<p><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>⋅</mo><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>⋅</mo><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v = c_1 \cdot v_1 + c_2 \cdot v_2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> for some constants <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">c_1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">c_2.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_pull/split.png">
    We first split <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> into its eigenvector subcomponents.
</p>

<p>When we have this representation, we can then rethink <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> as:</p>

<p>or more simply:</p>

<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mi>v</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>⋅</mo><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>⋅</mo><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v = c_1 \cdot A^3v_1 + c_2\cdot A^3v_2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_pull/process.png">
    We then carry out <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v_1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mn>3</mn><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^33v_2.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>

<h3 id="dominant-eignevalues-and-eigenvectors">Dominant Eignevalues and Eigenvectors</h3>

<p>Now, what happens when <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is larger than <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> (i.e. there exists a dominant eigenvalue)? In this example, <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>5</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_1 = 5</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_2 = 2.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> Let’s now display what it would look like to carry out <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> when we have this difference in eigenvalues.</p>

<p>The interaction below shows this setup:</p>




    
    
    




<ol>
  <li>Drag the slider to increase or decrease the number of times we apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> on <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></li>
  <li>Notice how “Output Eigenvector 1” and “Output Eigenvector 2” change at different rates.</li>
  <li>Notice how “Final Output Vector” tilts towards “Output Eigenvector 1” as you drag the slider to the right.</li>
</ol>

<p>We thus see that when there’s one eigenvalue larger than the other (<span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>&gt;</mo><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_1 &gt; \lambda_2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>), the linear function pushes its inputs towards the eigenvector associated with that large eigenvalue (“Output EigenVector One”). The more times we apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, the larger this effect.</p>

<p>Note this “push” effect will only happen towards this eigenvector with the largest eignevalue - not any of the other eigenvectors.</p>

<h3 id="why-this-happens">Why this happens</h3>

<p>This tilt towards “Output Vector One” happens due to exponential growth. <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mi>λ</mi><mn>1</mn><mi>x</mi></msubsup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_1^x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> grows much faster than <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mi>λ</mi><mn>2</mn><mi>x</mi></msubsup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_2^x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. As such the more times we apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> (<span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> in our exponentials), the bigger the difference between <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mi>λ</mi><mn>1</mn><mi>x</mi></msubsup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_1^x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mi>λ</mi><mn>2</mn><mi>x</mi></msubsup><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_2^x.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> Hence the <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v_1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> term has much more weight in the final sum. This increasing difference is shown in the plot below.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_pull/exponentials.png">
    Due to the power of exponentials, the dominant eigenvector will play a bigger and bigger role the more times we apply A. Notice how the distance between the two expontial functions increases with x.
</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>So, just using the properties of linear functions, we are able to see why eigenvectors are so important. They show us where a linear function will “push” its inputs.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><picture id="hero-thumbnail">
<source data-srcset="https://kelda.io/img/blog/central-manage.webp" type="image/webp"></picture><p><h2>Published on Jul 31, 2020</h2></p></section><p>Let’s discuss an extremely common anti-pattern I’ve noticed with teams that are relatively new to containers/cloud-native/kubernetes, etc. More so than when building traditional monoliths, cloud-native applications can be incredibly complex and, as a result, need a relatively sophisticated development environment. Unfortunately, this need often isn’t evident at the beginning of the cloud-native journey. Development environments are an afterthought – a cumbersome, heavy, brittle drag on productivity.</p><p>The best teams treat development environments as a priority and devote significant DevOps/SRE time to perfecting them. In doing so, they end up with development environments that “just work” for every developer, not just those who are experienced with containers and Kubernetes. For these teams, every developer has a fast, easy-to-use development environment that works for every developer every time.</p><h2 id="whats-a-development-environment">What’s a development environment?</h2><p>Before we go further, let’s get on the same page about what we mean by a development environment in this context. When working with cloud-native applications, each service depends on numerous containers, serverless functions, and cloud services to operate. For this post, a development environment is a sandbox in which developers can run their code and dependencies for testing. It’s not the IDE, compiler, debugger, or any of those other tools.</p><h2 id="sound-familiar">Sound Familiar?</h2><p>You’re working on a new project or planning to modernize an old one. The team has read all about the whiz-bang nifty new cloud-native technologies, like containers, Kubernetes, etc. So, you decide to take the plunge and build a cloud-native app.</p><p>The team realizes that a core group of DevOps/SREs will be necessary to get everything running in a scalable, reliable, and automated setup. DevOps engineers are hired/trained and get to work. They setup up Kubernetes, CI/CD, monitoring, logging, and all of the other tools we’ve learned are critical for a modern application.</p><p>Everyone knows that it’s the DevOps/SRE team’s job to get all of this stuff up and running. However, development environments aren’t top of mind. The DevOps team considers it their duty to focus on production and CI/CD – Development is the developer’s job. At the same time, the developers think it’s their job to deliver application features, not to maintain infrastructure. It’s not really anyone’s responsibility to focus on developer experience before CI/CD, so it’s neglected.</p><div><div><h2 id="why-cloud-native-kills-developer-productivityhttpskeldaiowhitepaper"><a href="https://kelda.io/whitepaper/">Why Cloud Native kills developer productivity</a></h2><p>Making the switch to microservices but think it’s too good to be true? Or you already made the switch but you’re starting to notice that local development is harder than it used to be. You’re not alone. <a href="https://kelda.io/whitepaper/">Read more of this whitepaper</a></p></div><picture>
<source data-srcset="https://kelda.io/img/Whitepaper.webp" type="image/webp"><img data-src="https://kelda.io/img/Whitepaper.png" alt="img" src="https://kelda.io/img/Whitepaper.png"></picture></div><p>Unfortunately, an ad hoc approach to development environments tends to emerge. Whenever there’s a new service, whatever developer happens to be working on it, realizes they need some way to boot their dependencies and test their code. They Google around and figure that Docker Compose is a reasonable way to do this. They copy and paste some example, tweak through trial and error until it’s working, and move on. The quality fo this initial compose file ranges widely depending on the DevOps knowledge of the engineer who happened to write it. Sometimes it’s pretty solid; sometimes, it’s brittle and slow.</p><p>Worse, this process repeats. Every time there’s a new service, it gets a new git repository, and some new engineer finds themselves writing a compose file. Perhaps this new file is copied from an existing project. Perhaps it’s developed from scratch. Either way, now we have two compose files that need to be maintained and updated as the app changes over time. This process repeats and repeats until all services have their own ever so slightly different configuration files that are a nightmare to maintain.</p><p>As a result of this (all too common) process. We see several typical issues:</p><ul><li>Development environments are unmanageable. They spread across dozens of repositories in dozens of subtly different copy-and-pasted docker-compose files. Keeping these up to date in a fast-changing application is impossible.</li><li>Development environments are incomplete. They only deal with containers because they are the easiest for an individual developer to get up and running with docker-compose. Everything else developers need to test (serverless functions, databases, specialty cloud services) requires manual effort.</li><li>Developers waste time focusing on things that aren’t their specialization. Just as most backend engineers can’t CSS their way out of a paper bag, there’s no reason for every frontend/AI/data engineer to be experts on the current DevOps trends. Developers shouldn’t spend time configuring and debugging development environments — they should spend time building features.</li></ul><h2 id="managed-development-environments">Managed Development Environments</h2><p>So how do we avoid this all-too-common scenario? The good news is that it’s not particularly challenging to do so if you’re intentional and proactive. The best teams tend to follow a couple of principles to ensure a great experience.</p><p><strong>Clear Responsibility</strong>:</p><p>There’s a team that is explicitly responsible for providing development environments for all developers. That team can be the DevOps/SRE team, or a dedicated developer productivity team. The key is that it’s someone’s job to focus on this issue. Furthermore, that person is likely someone with a large amount of DevOps expertise that will produce better outcomes more efficiently.</p><p><strong>Central Management</strong>:</p><p>The development environment must be managed centrally by the DevOps team responsible for it. A single git repository contains all of the configuration and scripts necessary for a developer to get going. When the DevOps team changes something, they do so once in that central repository, and all developers benefit. Furthermore, typically, the development environments run in a centrally managed cluster in the cloud. As a result, it’s easy for the DevOps team to ensure things work consistently for everyone, and debug problems when they do arise.</p><p><strong>Full Automation</strong>:</p><p>Their development environments are fully automated. A single command brings up everything a developer needs to test their code. Developers don’t need to do nearly any manual setup work beyond the code changes they’re actively working on.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Achieving these goals isn’t easy. It requires a significant and sustained investment from the DevOps team, and buy-in from developers and management to succeed. However, while the cost can be significant, it’s small relative to the wasted time and effort saved by giving every developer a fast environment that just works every time.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>I</span>n their long-running effort to defeat cancer, medical researchers have made a startling discovery: A lot of the time, they have no idea how their anti-cancer drugs work. And, strange as it may sound, that is actually great news for future&nbsp;therapies.</p>
<p>â€œWeâ€™re not saying these drugs arenâ€™t good,â€� explains Ann Lin, a geneticist at Stanford University. They really do kill cancerous cells, often quite well; they just donâ€™t do the job the way that their developers believed, she finds. Her work highlights how much of anticancer drug discovery is still based on trial-and-error searches. Itâ€™s as if your auto mechanic learned to fix your car by kicking the fenders and smacking the hood until it started. That technique might get the job done, but there would be no way to improve it or to figure out what went wrong if it failed the next time. Similarly, oncologists have often been forced to rely on drugs without a clear understanding of their mechanism of action, Lin notes; in essence, they were kicking and smacking the tumors at a molecular level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Learning what they <em>donâ€™t</em> know about those drugs is a critically important step forward. It is allowing Lin and her colleagues to zero in on the actual, specific molecular mechanisms that really do kill cancerous cells. Now that those mechanisms are being identified, drug developers will be able to carry out targeted searches for other treatments that attack cancer the same way.</p>
<p>Better yet, thatâ€™s still only half of the story. While Lin is identifying molecular mechanisms that could lead to new anticancer drugs, Todd Golub is working the problem from the other end—identifying anticancer drugs that could lead to the discovery of new mechanisms.</p>
<blockquote>Drug developers will be able to carry out targeted searches for new treatments.</blockquote>
<p>Golub, the chief scientific officer and director of the Cancer Program at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, realized that trial-and-error searches could actually be extremely useful if there were a way to make them fast and efficient. Extending the metaphor: If you could rapidly try a million different combinations of hood-smacking and fender-kicking,&nbsp;you would undoubtedly&nbsp;uncover surprising new ways to fix your car. The Golub Lab has&nbsp;developed a technique just like that for cancer treatments:&nbsp;a high-speed drug-screening process called <a href="https://www.theprismlab.org/" target="_blank">PRISM</a> (profiling relative inhibition simultaneously in mixtures), which has already proven spectacularly successful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Golub sees Linâ€™s targeted studies and his own, broad-based drug searches coming together in an open-source database of cancer-fighting tools called the <a href="https://depmap.org/portal/" target="_blank">Cancer Dependency Map</a>. He and his colleagues describe that map as â€œthe preclinical foundation for cancer precision medicineâ€�—a future in which researchers not only know exactly how their drugs work, but also how to tailor them best to the needs of each individual patient.</p>
<p><span>T</span>hese advances come at a critical time. The National Institutes of Health projects that more&nbsp;than 600,000 people will&nbsp;die of cancer this year in the United States, accounting for nearly one out of every four deaths. Progress in cancer treatment has been slow: â€œNinety-seven percent of cancer drugs are predicted to fail clinical trials, more than in any other field,â€� Lin says. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic has diverted short-term research away from cancer, even as the coronavirus poses a heightened risk to patients with compromised immune systems.</p>
<p>When Lin started out, she had no inkling she would be taking on such huge challenges. In 2017, while she was a researcher in the lab of <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/research/faculty-staff/jason-sheltzer/" target="_blank">Jason Sheltzer</a> at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, she&nbsp;was conducting a seemingly routine analysis of the way that cancer cells use an enzyme called MELK. Numerous studies had determined the cancer cells canâ€™t live without that enzyme, so it seemed like a promising point of vulnerability. Several MELK-blocking compounds were already undergoing clinical trials as potential anti-cancer drugs.
</p>
<p>Lin was merely trying to learn a little more about why MELK was so essential. â€œThat's when we got the big surprise,â€� she says.</p>
<p>Using a set of gene-editing molecules known as CRISPR/Cas 9, Lin and her collaborators engineered a batch of cancer cells that couldnâ€™t produce any MELK. Instead of dying, though, the cells carried on just fine. Puzzled, she ran the experiment a second time; again, the cells lived. The team then conducted similar experiments on five other supposed cancer targets, all of which also had at least one associated anti-cancer drug in clinical trials. In each case, the cancer cells didnâ€™t care about the specific genes allegedly being targeted by the drugs. Yet, somehow, those drugs&nbsp;were killing cancer cells anyway.
</p>
<p>CRISPR enabled Lin and her team to examine one of the anti-MELK drugs in detail,&nbsp;and thereby&nbsp;to <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/24179" target="_blank">solve the mystery</a>. They determined that the drug attacks cancer cells through a completely different mechanism than the one its developers thought they were going after: It shuts down an enzyme called cyclin-dependent kinase 11, or&nbsp;CDK11, which regulates cancer growth. Researchers had previously attempted to develop drugs that blocked CDK11, but without success—or so they thought. It turns out they had hit their target without even knowing it.</p>
<p>Armed with this deeper insight, oncologists can begin developing more accurate anti-cancer treatments. Even so, bringing those drugs to market will remain&nbsp;a complicated and time-consuming process. Thatâ€™s where Golub comes in.</p>
<p><span>I</span>nstead of looking for drugs that kill cancer, studying how they work, and finally testing if theyâ€™re safe, Golubâ€™s group started with a pool of medical compounds that had already been cleared for human use. They went prospecting in the Broad Institute's Drug Repurposing Hub, an enormous collection of unused pharmaceuticals that passed safety tests but didnâ€™t perform well in late-stage clinical trials. Most of the drugs were developed for other diseases, but Golub suspected that some of them serendipitously would prove effective against cancer.</p>
<p>To find out, he pitted 4,518 different drugs against 578 cancer cell lines taken from 24 different types of tumors. It sounds like an insane process of trial-and-error, and just a few years ago it would have been. The PRISM technique is what makes it practical: By attaching a genetic â€œbarcodeâ€� to each cell line, the researchers were able to test multiple lines at the same time and to automate the whole, data-intensive process.</p>
<p>In the end, Golub team was amazed to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-019-0018-6" target="_blank">discover</a> that nearly 50 of the discarded drugs had anti-cancer activities. Since they had already passed safety trials, these compounds could now speed through the testing process. Even more exciting, some of the drugs flagged in this experiment seem to attack cancers in ways not seen in the lab before. These novel cancer-fighters are prime candidates for the kind of CRISPR analysis that Lin performs, potentially revealing undiscovered molecular techniques for fighting cancer.</p>
<blockquote>Almost 50 of the discarded drugs had anti-cancer activities.</blockquote>
<p>That merger of trial-and-error discovery and targeted analysis is already beginning at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia. Sara Althubaiti, a bioinformatics expert at the university, has created artificial-intelligence software that sifts through huge databases describing the genetics of cancer. The AI ferrets out previously undiscovered relationships between DNA mutations and cancer behavior. It has already identified dozens of potential anti-cancer target genes—the kind of information needed to fill in Golubâ€™s Cancer Dependency Map.</p>
<p>Lin is heartened to see her early, seemingly botched experiments contributing to this new assault on cancer. With CRISPR precision and PRISM breadth working together, she says, â€œwe might be able to create a more rigorous preclinical pipeline.â€� No fender-kicking required.

                        <p><img title="MBA Reading List" src="https://www.blog.consultants500.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MBA-Reading-List-1024x512.png" alt="" width="740" height="370" srcset="https://www.blog.consultants500.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MBA-Reading-List.png 1024w, https://www.blog.consultants500.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MBA-Reading-List-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px"></p><p>Business Books offer a great wayÂ&nbsp;of learning and at a much lower price than taking, for example, a specialist MBA Course. By reading a book, you consume a huge amount of research in a relatively short amount of time, and it is one of the best ways to improve your skills.</p>
<p>The only problem is that there are a lot of Business Books in the market and there are much more to come. For instance, just doing a search for â€œBusiness Booksâ€� books in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_1_14?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=business+books&amp;sprefix=business+books%2Caps%2C226&amp;crid=VKPDC8K8KJNM" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a> results in more than 2 million books about Business, so how do you make up your mind about what to read?</p>
<p>You can do a google search and search for the <a href="https://www.google.nl/search?q=best+business+books&amp;oq=best+business+books&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i61j0l4.6367j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Best Business Books</a>, but then you get hundreds of â€œBest of Listsâ€� in front of you, so that doesnâ€™t help a lot either unless you want to spend a full day going through all those lists. Well, that is exactly what we did! We searched for 50 â€œBest of Listsâ€� highlightingÂ&nbsp;the most recommendable Business Books by authority sites, then we tried to find MBA Reading Lists recommended by the Best Business Schools in the world, selected and combined the 20 most valuable â€œBest of Listsâ€� / “MBA Reading Lists” and earmarked and ranked what Business Books keep up appearing on most of those recently published lists. <strong>From a total of 182 books reviewed and ranked, here are the 20 most recommended Business Books that appear on most of the MBA Reading Lists!</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As a web developer, I know the pains of trying to work around kinks to support all variations of all major browsers to have a unified look, feel, and performance. Even though today the top browsers do a better job at supporting and implementing new web-standards it’s far from a perfect situation. So when I heard <a href="http://my.opera.com/haavard/blog/2013/02/13/webkit">Opera was switching its rendering engine</a> to WebKit, a first major browser to do so <a href="http://www.slashgeek.net/2012/06/08/5-features-opera-browser-did-first/">among many other Opera firsts</a>, I was excited because it means I will have one less browser to test for mundanely simple things that all browser should have by default, and do a good job at it.<span id="more-813"></span></p><p>Why do all browsers have such varied levels of performance in implementing web standards?</p><ul><li>Because they are lazy, think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_6#Criticism">IE-6 team</a>.</li><li>Because they don’t agree with web-standards and pick and choose which standard they want to support.</li><li>Because depending on how their rendering engine works, it can be harder or take longer to implement on some browsers.</li><li>Because every browser team has their definition of how a web standard should be implemented. So even if all browsers support a web-standard they might not work the same way.</li></ul><p>If you want a single example on pitfalls of having too many options, <em>web rendering engines</em> would be the perfect candidate.</p><center><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.slashgeek.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/opera-webkit.jpg"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.slashgeek.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/opera-webkit.jpg?resize=399%2C388" alt="opera-webkit" width="399" height="388" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.slashgeek.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/opera-webkit.jpg?w=399&amp;ssl=1 399w, https://i1.wp.com/www.slashgeek.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/opera-webkit.jpg?resize=300%2C291&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.slashgeek.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/opera-webkit.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></center><p>Yes, there are valid reasons to worry about having a single choice for the rendering engine. That it might make web-standards less important. That the power might shift to rendering engine as opposed to web standards. But, WebKit is open source and there already exists <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_web_browsers#WebKit-based">many forks of it</a>. Think of WebKit as a Linux kernel and Browsers, using WebKit, as <a href="http://www.slashgeek.net/2012/12/26/create-your-own-custom-ubuntu-based-linux-distro/">Linux Distributions</a>. You can use the same Kernel/WebKit but your performance and feature will and can wildly vary depending on your implementation. There is a reason why people stick with a certain distribution, even though the underlying infrastructure is the same/similar the result and experience can be wildly different. Centos and Ubuntu may use the same kernel and still provide a wildly different level of user experience.</p><p>I rather deal with several forks of WebKit, than deal with different rendering engines. In the end, only the browser with the best user experience will win the race. As we have seen with Firefox and now with Chrome.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>Leading a team is difficult – it’s why people love or hate the job. Where a team member incorporates themselves into the people and culture around them, the team lead drives that assimilation and culture. They must understand that each person has a different personality, and therefore each team culture is different.</p>



<p>If this wasn’t enough of a challenge, team leaders need to handle difficult members of their team. In my opinion, this is the most challenging part of the job. A team member who acts in a way that is destructive to their team them means your team suffers. In the medium to long term, if the team keeps suffering, then you have ultimately failed as the team lead.</p>



<p>Fortunately, there are methods and techniques to manage such people. However, it is not a simple or pleasant task. Effectively managing difficult people comes with knowledge and practice. Expect to make a few mistakes along the way. Keep the goal clear in your mind – to develop a high performing team. If you reflect on it, then you will make better judgements when it comes to difficult scenarios in your team.</p>



<p>Below are some of the scenarios I have come across and how I think they should be dealt with.</p>



<h2>Proud Seniors</h2>



<p>Every team has at least one or more seniors on the team. Let’s call him Rob. Rob’s role is to lead the team in a technical manner and make intelligent and informed decisions for the team while coaching less experienced members. Above all, Rob sets a standard for the team and makes sure the standard is upheld.</p>



<p>As Uncle Ben said, ‘With great power, comes great responsibility’. When a leader within the team abuses their position, or does not know how to deal effectively with others, then it can damage other members of the team.</p>



<p>I have often seen Rob act inappropriately towards his team. Sometimes Rob is loud and outspoken and happy to talk over the more junior members of the team. Rob’s opinions are often the only ones heard, while he snaps or condescends other opinions. This can be a natural response –&nbsp; Rob feels like he has the best opinion because he is most experienced. As a result, any challenge is personal.</p>



<p>In a high performing team, each individual must be comfortable to speak out and voice their opinions without judgement. Even juniors who have little experience often give valuable insight into the simple things that the rest of the team have become accustomed to. You need to work to allow Rob’s experience to come through in decision making, while making sure everyone on the team is comfortable voicing their opinions.</p>



<h3><strong>Resolution</strong></h3>



<p>Remember – your goal is to develop a high performing team. In the above scenario the relationship between Rob and the rest of the team is broken. So the question is, how do we repair and maintain that relationship?</p>



<p>In my experience, having Rob work closely with everyone else on the team is the quickest way to mend the relationships. Rather than assigning tasks to Rob and have him work by himself, assign the task to a more junior member and get Rob to oversee it. In this way, Rob will be forced to work on his communication and develop an understanding with the rest of the team.</p>



<p>Over time relationships grow stronger and the more junior team members voice their opinions more often since they are now more comfortable speaking with Rob. Even if Rob’s attitude does not soften, at the very least everyone will know his personality well enough to be comfortable challenging it.</p>



<h2><strong>Too many egos spoil the broth</strong></h2>



<p>Working on a team with one Rob is challenging. A team with multiple Robs can be nearly impossible to handle at times. I have not worked directly on such a team, but I have experienced it by proxy in my managerial days when I had meetings with individual teams.</p>



<p>The most common place egos clash is in the beginning, when the team is being formed. The four team stages of team formation are commonly known as “Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing”. (ref <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development</a> ). When a team begins to form, people aren’t really sure what position they have in the ‘hierarchy’ of the team. They’re not sure what kind of personalities surround them or each other’s backgrounds.</p>



<p>Once the team have been ‘formed’, in other words, once they recognise who will be on their team going forward, then they enter the ‘storming’ phase. This is the phase where team members challenge each other and voice their opinions. This is also the phase that is most painful for the team lead.</p>



<p>As the team try to familiarise themselves with the other team members, they spark and argue with ideas other team members put forward. This is amplified further in job sectors with a high competition – software for example. Each individual on the team wants to be correct and will stand by their views no matter what.</p>



<h3><strong>Resolution</strong></h3>



<p>Don’t worry! This is a natural part of the team’s journey and it will pass.</p>



<p>Once your team gets to know each other, egos will settle down and your team will enter the ‘norming’ phase where they get comfortable with each other and begin working as a team towards the common goal.</p>



<p>In the meantime, it is an opportunity for you to practice conflict resolution. Ever wonder what it would be like to be a politician? Here’s your chance!</p>



<p>If you find that the team are still not settling in with each other, then it might be time to bring in some team practices in order to make decisions and resolve their arguing. You need to discuss this directly with the team (at a retro is a good time) and brainstorm some ways to achieve decisions.</p>



<p>Some ideas for achieving resolutions is to take a team vote, refer to an external expert (if one exists), lay out the pros and cons of the arguments, or refer to the technical lead within the team.</p>



<h2><strong>Unproductive Members</strong></h2>



<p>In any industry and on any team, there are some people who are highly productive and driven, and others who are the polar opposite. I once discovered someone who, hired as a software developer, had merged about 5 commits in the few years they worked in that company. In total, their code contribution amounted to a maximum of 100 lines of code. Let’s call this person Mike.</p>



<p>The Mikes of the world are lazy, unproductive and always have an excuse why their tasks are not completed. Believe it or not, Mike could be the most dangerous and destructive person on your team. All your other team members look at Mike and see the lack of focus and output coming from him. When a difficult job comes, they wonder why they should be bothered to do a good job if Mike is getting away with doing nothing.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Mike brings down the team moral. He is taking up a space which could be filled by a worthwhile and valuable team member. A brand new junior just out of college is far more valuable than Mike. At least a junior is willing to work their way up the ladder and assimilate into the team. Mike has no such goals.</p>



<h3><strong>Resolution</strong></h3>



<p>How do we deal with someone like Mike? Believe it or not, Mike’s problem may not be his lack of knowledge – it is his lack of accountability. Mike has gotten into the habit of working the minimal amount and discovered that by working poorly and making excuses, he can reduce his work load and take it easy.</p>



<p>So the question is – how to increase Mike’s accountability? It’s quite simple – don’t let Mike work by himself!</p>



<p>Remember how Mike made just 5 commits at his company over a couple of years? What do you think the scrum master did? He continued to assign small tasks to Mike and leave him by himself without anyone working him. Mike had no accountability to his team, so he didn’t hold himself accountable. To this day, Mike is known for doing the smallest amount of work, and nobody wants to work with him.</p>



<p>As team lead, you can fix this surprisingly quickly. Team Mike up with one of the more productive members (Vicky) who can guide Mike and hold him accountable. Vicky can support Mike in working on his tasks in a ‘pair-programming’ manner. This will prevent Mike from skipping off for a few hours or getting distracted easily.</p>



<p>For each of Mike’s tasks, ensure that he is not working by himself – always pair him with someone else. You might think that this is a waste of Vicky’s time. In the short term, this may be true. But in the long term, Mike will develop a discipline and become more productive by himself. He will gradually gain back the trust of the team and hold himself to the same accountability as the rest of the team. Over the long term, the team will benefit greatly from having the extra productive team member.</p>



<p><em>Side note: There is an argument to be made that nobody in the team should work by themselves, but that’s for a different post.</em></p>



<h2><strong>Just..not…interested</strong></h2>



<p>In any team, there are jobs that nobody wants to do. Documentation, bugs, support, admin, testing…the list goes on. As the team lead, it should be one of your focuses to provide each team member with a balanced workload according to their skill set.</p>



<p>Notice how I didn’t say that everyone should have an equal workload – that is a bad tactic for a high performing team. As a quick example, juniors learn quickest by getting involved in some of the boring work (testing, documentation). Whereas seniors are kept interested by removing this work from them as much as possible.</p>



<h3>Resolution</h3>



<p>Each person on the team needs work that is challenging according to their expertise. If one of your team says they are bored of their work, ask them politely what they find boring or tedious. Then work on speeding up the completion of that work and get them onto something they would rather do.</p>



<p>Look back over their previous tasks. Have they been assigned work on numerous occasions that does not challenge them? Can this type of work be shared or shifted to a more junior member? Make a note that their work needs to be more varied in the future.</p>

<p>I’ve been working remotely at <a href="https://buffer.com/">Buffer</a> for 6 years now. As a software engineer, one of the critical skill I believe we <del>should</del> <strong>must</strong> have is being able to learn continuously. However, working in a fully distributed team, <a href="https://timezone.io/team/buffer">split accross 10+ timezones</a>. I live in Asia (UTC +8) while most of my teammates live in the US or Europe. That’s up to 15 hours difference. We only meet each other <a href="https://joel.is/the-power-of-company-retreats/">once a year</a>. This remote setup affects how we learn from my team, compared to if I were in a physical office.</p>
<p>With the current COVID-19 crisis, when company suddenly switched to a work from home setup, understanding how the dynamic of knowledge sharing in your team is important. You don’t want the knowledge shared being stopped. I’ll lay down some of our successful experiments, their pros and cons, what I think works for me and our company.</p>
<h2 id="-the-real-miss-opportunity-in-a-remote-team-knowledge-sharing">❌🧠 The real miss opportunity in a remote team, knowledge sharing</h2>
<p>In a remote team, we don’t have regular random opportunities to come together like we would in a physical office. Conversations will be focused within your current team conversation channel. You won’t be able talk over the watercooler/coffee machine about your current issues with someone else than your core team. You’ll miss opportunities to talk with other teams about their challenges, bring up your expertise, and learn from someone else experiences/advices from an other team. We stop learning as much as we could because we’re not seing each other anymore.</p>
<p>As a remote company, how can you overcome this challenge? How do you optimize knowledge sharing, no matter which timezone?
This is where the concept of regular snackchats at Buffer was born 3 years ago, introduced by <a href="https://twitter.com/sunils34/">Sunil</a>.</p>
<h2 id="-snackchats">🍴💬 Snackchats</h2>
<p>Snackchats are small talks that everyone can propose in the company. It can be any topics, from code, architecture, management, tips for a tool to side projects.  Anything really. We usually ask on slack, and if you  there is enough interest, you commit to it and prepare it.
Here an example of <a href="https://tik.dev/">Tigran</a> asking interest on using Datadog Logs with APM together:</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/snackchat-tigran-asks.png" alt="Snackchat Tigran asks interest"></p>
<p>Here a great example of snackchat by <a href="https://hami.sh/">Hamish</a> on an “Intro to GitHub Actions”:</p>

<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M9sdqTc5_qg" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</p>

<p>Also here some other great ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/federicoweber">Federico</a> on <a href="https://overflow.buffer.com/2018/06/08/snackchat-may-31-product-oriented-git-workflow/">git workflow</a></li>
<li><a href="https://joebirch.co/">Joe</a> on “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7OCVQD97WE">Get started with Go</a>”</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tips-for-doing-a-snackchat">Tips for doing a snackchat</h4>
<ul>
<li>Keep them short: 10 to 20 minutes, keep interest of your audience</li>
<li>Record them, people will be able to see them later if they can’t attend</li>
<li>Your busy teammates will be able to see them at x2 speed</li>
<li>Have a directory (notion/wiki) for future reference</li>
<li>Like video call, putting a face, it’s great to have a human touch to something “technical” to see someones smilling, worrying.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-downsides-of-a-snackchat">The downsides of a Snackchat</h4>
<p>The downside of snackchat is that takes quite a bit of energy to prepare. There can also be intimidating to ask if a topic you might want to present won’t get enough interest from your workmates.
In a remote setting, people will try to make the best use of their time, and we might most of the time be busy on prioritties. The time you will set might not be the best fit for everyone. I wasn’t able to participate to most of the snackchats because I live in a total different timezone than most of the people in the company. The tip here is to <strong>make sure to record your snackchat</strong> and repost it for people who couldn’t attend them.</p>
<h2 id="-impromptu-knowledge-screencasts">⚡️ Impromptu Knowledge Screencasts</h2>
<p>An other format I personally enjoy doing is the “spontaneous” knowlege sharing with a screencast . I’m in the Infrastructure, where product engineers might not necessarly have the need to understand what happens “behind the scene”, but where the knowledge could be useful or pick their curiosity.</p>
<p>I especially enjoy the screencast format for few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Snackchats requires preparations, and I know I will not be great at “live” presentations</li>
<li>I’m more in the introvert side.  It require quite a bit of energy to ask interests, worrying if people. Sharing when I feel like it is a way that fits me and I’m satisfied with.</li>
<li>My envy to create educative content isn’t always consistent. There is some days where I will be more encline to share it and some where I’ll not feel like it.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tips-on-making-impromptu-knowledge-screencasts">Tips on making “Impromptu Knowledge Screencasts”</h4>
<ul>
<li>I like using <a href="https://www.loom.com/">Loom</a>. They make recording your screen and voice really easy. It also allows you to pause the recording, and aslso has an impressive online editor to trim your blanks.</li>
<li>Try to keep the video dynamic, go to the point, and avoid the fluff, but keep the jokes</li>
<li>Keep it short, ideally under 10 minutes</li>
<li>When I know a video will be valuable on the long term, I try to do some Google slide to structure the video</li>
</ul>
<p>Here an example where I wanted to show (not the first time) the benefits of using one of our internal librarie to make debuguing faster and easier:</p>


<p>1 picture is worth a thousand words, but 1 GIF worth a lot more. It can save you or your teammates a lot of time, save you some context switching, and save your productivity. When someone has a question, or you want to explain something complicated, a simple GIF of the solution will be more than enough than trying to make on a call and explain it.</p>
<p>I enjoy using <a href="https://www.getcloudapp.com/">cloudapp</a>. For example here what I’ll share when I wanted to share the results after migrating a service from PHP to Golang:</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/go-vs-php-cpu.gif" alt="PHP vs Golang CPU usage"></p>
<h2 id="-make-sharing-knowledge-explicitely-valuable">🥇 Make sharing knowledge explicitely valuable</h2>
<p>At Buffer, we have an <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k_QkZISJ2cIk_Py_pdzsAt5fUwWOYZVkkXg4KZM8IXA/htmlview">engineerig framework</a> that encourage kowledge sharing. To reach a “Senior Engineer 2”, One of the criteria would be… “educates across domain” or “Reach out to other teams within and beyond Buffer to share knowledge”. I don’t mean that money should be the incentive, but , I’ve personally because it was one of the condition to reach the next step, but then started to enjoy it more and more. I’m now doing it because I see value in it now whe other teamate tells me how valuable are my videos.</p>
<p>An other great way to encourange to continue sharing is to reach people who share that their knowledge were helpful. Here for example <a href="https://josemdev.com/">Jose</a> telling me he is using my video for a future mongoDB upgrade:</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/jose-watch-eric-loom.jpg" alt="MongDB upgrade Jose watch"></p>
<h2 id="-be-a-teacher-dont-make-asssumptions-over-communicate">👨‍🏫 Be a teacher, don’t make asssumptions, over communicate</h2>
<p>In a remote team, informations get easily lost. Other team members might not have the same context as you, new hires are recurrent occurence, and won’t dare to ask <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_such_thing_as_a_stupid_question">“stupid questions”</a>.</p>
<p>Extra communication is key, don’t make assumption, the more you say, the better teamates will get more knowledge. I’ve even more for trivial questions, where some fundamental might be missing and where your informations will be be really valuable</p>
<p>One of the favorite people I’ve been working at Buffer is certainly <a href="https://twitter.com/colinscape">Colin</a>. Since day 1 I’ve joined the company, he’s been relentlessy explaining and giving context if any issues or questions arises. He’s been certainly the go to person when engineers has doubts or need advices. Indirectly, it help to make you look “approachable” for new members, especially in a remote settings where you won’t have much chance to interract.  Sharing knowledge is definitely a great mark of leadership.</p>
<p>Additioanlly, It will help creating a great culture in your company where there no stupid question exists, and where your team will feel safe.</p>

<p>Sharing links via Slack or email are great, but those content get easily lost. You shouldn’t make assumptions your teammates saw the video or message you’ve shared the other week. I recommend to maintain a directory (in Notion/Paper/Wiki etc…). When you see a question that was answered in one of your video, share it again. A natural snowball effect will happen when your teammates will see more and more people sharing their knowledge.</p>
<p>Keep sharing ❤️</p>

<p><em>No one is watching. No one is listening. No one cares.</em></p>



<p>It’s funny, when you want to <em>send something out</em> to the world, those words are among your greatest fears. </p>



<p>But when you want to <em>keep something from</em> the world, those words can bring you the greatest comfort.</p>



<p>So, what happens when those two desires collide? You get this essay. </p>



<p>For days and even weeks, I have been agonizing and ruminating over whether or not to write this. The full story is so deep, so personal, so raw, that I have never even told my closest friends. It’s a story full of the deepest pain, yet the most amazing beauty. It’s a story so improbable, yet so inspiring. It’s something I’ve avoided discussing my entire life, until now.</p>



<p>If I had to summarize my life, I’d point you to a poem by Tupac, <em>The Rose That Grew From Concrete.&nbsp;</em></p>



<pre><span><em>Did you hear about the rose that grew</em><br><em>from a crack in the concrete?</em><br><em>Proving nature's law is wrong it</em><br><em>learned to walk with out having feet.</em><br><em>Funny it seems, but by keeping its dreams,</em><br><em>it learned to breathe fresh air.</em><br><em>Long live the rose that grew from concrete</em><br><em>when no one else ever cared.</em></span></pre>



<p>Life works in strange ways. And it’s even stranger <em>when you are</em> the rose.</p>



<p>Life has a way of taking our assumptions, flipping them upside down, turning them around, and obliterating them right in front of our eyes.</p>



<p>And <em>that</em> is how my story starts.</p>



<h3><strong>Procrastination or Avoidance?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>If you’ve read one of my previous posts on <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/07/14/hacking-procrastination/">how to avoid procrastination</a>, you might have sensed that I was putting off something that needed to be done. Ironically, in writing that, I was procrastinating.</p>



<p>What you might not have sensed was that I have been avoiding something for a very long time. I have done everything in my power to avoid doing something that I am just now bringing myself, kicking and screaming, to do. Well, writing this essay is that <em>something</em>.</p>



<p>I’ve realized that confining my story within the walls of my mind is a bit selfish. There are millions of people in this world who need to hear my story because there can sometimes be nowhere or no one to turn to for help. Millions of people have dealt with the effects, whether internally or from others, of mental illness. I hope my story can offer a glimmer of support or hope. And furthermore, I realize <em>in order to move fully into the future, I must first set myself free from the past.</em></p>

<h3><strong>Questions</strong></h3>



<p><em>For the first 29 years of my life, I have been running. Running for 29 years can become exhausting, especially if you don’t stop to breathe. But stopping to breathe is, ironically, the best way to keep what’s chasing you from consuming you.</em></p>



<p>I have always shuttered at the idea of small talk. Sure, it might be necessary for connecting with people we wouldn’t otherwise speak with, but I think we would all be better off without it.</p>



<p>I’ve especially disliked being asked small-talk questions like “<em>what do you do for work?</em>” or “<em>what do you plan on doing with your college degree?</em>” I always forced myself to answer in some sort of smart and sophisticated way, but in reality, my story has never folded and unfolded so nicely.</p>



<p>And then, there is the set of questions that I loathed the most. The ones inquiring about my parents. Having faced so many of those questions throughout my life, I have become adept at sidestepping these questions with the dexterity of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=neo+dodging+bullets+matrix&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=iu&amp;ictx=1&amp;fir=XbFwxyF1hD-JPM%252CgLJU_iMBON_OkM%252C_&amp;vet=1&amp;usg=AI4_-kRuHKjeiZBOhl0rJPnE6J6S3jyCHA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj4voPilvrqAhWMlHIEHR9KAdQQ9QEwAXoECAQQHg&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=941#imgrc=TevdsbhIwP7p7M">Neo dodging bullets in the Matrix</a>.</p>



<p>My training ground for these types of questions was in school. When greeted by the question “how’s your mom?” I’d answer with a simple and superficial “good!” It wasn’t very difficult to hide the truth since my mom was fairly active in my life growing up. People knew who she was. They didn’t always know the battle she was fighting.</p>



<p>Occasionally kids would ask questions like “where’s your dad?” I would answer with something along the lines of “he’s busy.” These questions were much more challenging because I only rarely saw my dad. Once a week at best. He never was able to take me to school. Kids never saw him. Teachers never met him. To the outside world, he was, and still is, a mystery.</p>



<p>Each time I faced these questions, I knew I had to come up with some sort of creative way to weasel my way out in order to keep the truth about my upbringing hidden. I wish I could say I would have rather told the truth, but I had always felt a relief by keeping everything hidden. </p>



<p>This is no way for a kid to grow up.</p>



<p>One of the deepest <em>pains</em> in my life has come from the fact that I’ve never had what you would call “normal” parents. The ones who showed you the right way to live. The ones who took you to football practice. The ones who helped pay for college. The ones who cooked you dinner. And the ones who tucked you in at night.</p>



<p>Whatever “normal” parents do, I never had growing up.</p>



<p>But one of the deepest <em>joys</em> of my life has also come from the fact that I’ve never had what you would call “normal” parents.</p>



<h3><strong>My Source of Structure and Stability</strong></h3>



<p>Until I graduated high school, I lived in a rough neighborhood just outside of Philadelphia. As an only-child, raised predominantly by my maternal grandparents, I’ve had no choice but to figure out this world on my own.</p>



<p>My grandfather, a Filipino and Japanese man, of few words and even fewer visible emotions, instilled the discipline that always kept me in line; a discipline that kept me focused on achievement and away from making the wrong decisions. Combine that with eating rice with every meal, and I had an almost stereotypical East Asian upbringing.</p>



<p>My grandmother, who came to this country to escape the turmoil brought on by Fidel Castro in late 1950s Cuba, provided a sense of reliability and steadiness that I would never have had otherwise. She knew the value of personal freedom, and it showed through in how I grew up. She was the yin to my grandfather’s yang. She was there to watch cartoons with me before school, pick me up from the bus stop after school, and wash my clothes every week.</p>



<p>This is the structure I was so lucky to have as a child, considering that I lacked what most people would think of as “normal” parents. The one thing I’ll always be indebted to my grandparents for is that they kept me off the streets. For anyone who has lived in poorer inner city or suburb neighborhoods, you know how incredibly important that is for the development of a young mind. Put simply, if my grandparents hadn’t been there for me early on, I have no idea where I’d be today.</p>



<h3><strong>When Mental Illness Colors Your Outlook On Life</strong></h3>



<p>This is a part of my life that has never been revealed to anyone outside of my family. This is the story that has brought me the most pain over the years. But it is also the story I’m most proud of.  While not the entire story, this, in a nutshell, is what made me who I am today.</p>



<h4><strong><em>My Mom</em></strong></h4>



<p>My mom is a wonderful and loving woman with an extraordinarily creative mind. She has been creating artistic masterpieces through drawing and painting since before she gave birth to me at the age of 17. With as magnetic a personality as you’ll ever imagine, she infuses any room she walks into with an array of vibrant colors that you would find in one of her paintings.</p>



<p>As visible as her talents and personality are to everyone, equally invisible to the world has been her struggle to simply live a stable and consistent life. Since before I was born, she has struggled with the debilitating effects of Bipolar Disorder, a mental health condition that closely resembles a pendulum swinging wildly from one extreme to another. But she never let her condition hinder her from trying to be the best mother she could be.</p>



<p>As a young child who couldn’t possibly understand this, I became accustomed to the unpredictable and, at times, volatile behavior that my mom would occasionally exhibit. As a young mother, she was still coming to terms with how to manage her condition, while simultaneously learning how to raise a child of her own.</p>



<p>There were long stretches of time when she would be home to help raise me. There were also stretches of time when she would be absent from home, for reasons I could never understand. It wasn’t until my teenage years that I began to recognize that my mom wasn’t <em>abandoning</em> me during those times, but she had been seeking help with her condition in the best way any mental health experts could offer.</p>



<p>Through all her struggles, she has fought her hardest to give me the best life possible within her means. Through all of her sacrifices and horrible circumstances, she has shown me that I have always been her “<em>why</em>.” And through her determination to give me the kind of life she fought so hard to live, she proved that with a strong enough “<em>why</em>,” she could endure just about any “<em>how</em>.” <em>Her example has taught me that</em><em>,</em><em> with a meaningful purpose in life, just about any obstacle can be overcome.</em></p>



<h4><strong><em>My Dad</em></strong></h4>



<p>My dad is someone everyone needs in their life. He’s the type of guy who would never hesitate to give his umbrella, his coat, and the shirt off his back to someone in need in the middle of a rainstorm. He is truly a special soul, and someone who I’ll always look up to as an incredible source of inspiration. The tragedy of his story is that he simply never had the chance to live a normal life.</p>



<p>My dad was born in Italy in the 1960s. Much of the world, and Italy in particular, did not have much of an understanding of mental illness at the time. It is no surprise that two traditional Italian parents would never quite understand their only son who would make it past birth. Even when he came to America in the early 1970s, doctors could not offer any advice other than to wait for him to “grow out of it.”</p>



<p>Simply, my dad was born with a set of mental health conditions in an environment hostile to mental health conditions. In poker parlance, my dad was born with a <em>7-2 off suit</em>.</p>



<p>His youth was plagued with delays in speech and walking, …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>By James L. Gibson and Joseph L. Sutherland</strong></p><p>Dictators around the world muzzle debate. Autocratic governments label dissent as treasonous.&nbsp;The voice of the people is rarely heard.</p><p>The hallmark of a liberal democracy, by contrast, is that the people are allowed to assert their views and preferences even if the government, or the majority of their compatriots, don’t like it. They get to protest, to criticize, even to scream or holler or swear—and, on occasion, to listen and change their minds. But this dialogue, which is so central to our system of government, requires two essential ingredients: a willingness to put up with disagreeable views on the part of some and the confidence to express their opinions without fear of retribution on the part of others.</p><p>The most obvious threat to freedom of speech comes from the state: Citizens will only feel safe to criticize their president, for example, if they enjoy protections for their free speech and know that judges won’t do the bidding of the government. But as social scientists and political philosophers have long recognized, social pressures can be just as effective in making citizens afraid of expressing unpopular opinions: The more they fear getting fired from their job or publicly being branded as a “thought criminal,” the more likely they are to self-censor.</p><p>This is why it is so important to measure how free the citizen of democratic countries actually feel to express their views. Is it true, <a href="https://harpers.org/a-letter-on-justice-and-open-debate/">as some have argued</a>, that the current cultural climate has made Americans more reluctant to speak their mind than in the past? Or do we live in a golden age for rollicking debate in which, <a href="https://theobjective.substack.com/p/a-more-specific-letter-on-justice">as others have responded</a>, a far greater number of people feel empowered to join the conversation?</p><p>In the 1950s, many social scientists worried that efforts by Joe McCarthy and his allies to root out left-wingers were creating a “silent generation” of Americans who were afraid to share their political opinions in public. To test whether or not this was really the case, Samuel Stouffer, a Professor of Sociology at Harvard, decided to conduct an innovative public opinion survey. “Do you or don't you feel as free to speak your mind as you used to?” he asked a representative sample of Americans.</p><p>Back in 1954, the answer Stouffer got was surprisingly reassuring. Only about one in eight Americans at that time felt scared to speak their minds. As McCarthy’s influence on the country waned, there was little evidence that he had managed to manufacture a voiceless generation.</p><p>But since the 1950s, answers to that same question have become a lot more worrying. The last time the question was asked, the percentage of Americans who fear speaking their mind had grown by threefold. At its high point in 2015, nearly half of all Americans reported that they do not feel free to express their opinions. </p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe274367-6ba7-4850-b724-7a81580088e8_936x936.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe274367-6ba7-4850-b724-7a81580088e8_936x936.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/be274367-6ba7-4850-b724-7a81580088e8_936x936.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:936,&quot;width&quot;:936,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:286988,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></p><p>This trend is worrisome on its face. In comparison to the McCarthy era, it is ghastly. The answer to the question that is now so widely debated seems unambiguous: Americans are much more likely to self-censor today than in the past. </p><p>Perhaps, as some argue, we should not be too worried if some Americans feel the need to self-censor. If those who hold views that are racist or “deplorable” are feeling less free to hold forth than in the past, the country might become a more welcoming place for ethnic, religious, sexual, and other minorities. </p><p>But before we discount the large percentage of Americans who don’t feel free to speak their minds—or, worse, assume that they must feel uncomfortable to do so because they hold deeply despicable views—it is worth finding out who they actually are.</p><p>Three of the clearest findings from our research are negative in nature. First, one might suspect that many people are afraid to speak out because they fear the coercive force of the government. But the data suggest that this is not the case. Among those who believe that the government might prohibit certain political activities, such as organizing protest marches and demonstrations, 40 percent engaged in self-censorship. Among those who believe that it would not, 41 percent did. </p><p>Second, there is no clear partisan pattern. The percentage of Democrats who are worried about speaking their mind is just about identical to the percentage of Republicans who self-censor: 39 and 40 percent, respectively. </p><p>Finally, there is no clear relationship between the intensity of people’s views and their tendency to self-censor. Not only are those with right-wing views as likely to self-censor as those with left-wing views; moderates are just as likely to self-censor as those who fall on either end of the ideological spectrum. </p><p>So what <em>does</em> predict who is reluctant to speak up? The answer is that Americans are more likely to self-censor the more urban and educated they are. In a surprising reversal of the usual trends of political participation, in which citizens who have more resources feel more empowered to take an active role in civic life, it is the urbanites and the highly educated who are most afraid to speak their mind.</p><p>Consider education. Those who are more highly educated are far more likely to censor their views than their less educated brethren. Among Americans without a high school diploma, for example, 27 percent self-censor. Among Americans who completed high school, this goes up to 34 percent. And among those who have attended college for at least a few years, 45 percent do. This suggests that Americans are socialized into learning to keep their mouth shut: the longer you spend in the educational system, the more you learn that it is appropriate to express some views, but not others.</p><p>This helps to explain the nature of contemporary censorship culture. We might imagine that Americans engage in self-censorship if they lack the educational resources to know how they are supposed to talk about certain issues. But the evidence suggests that those Americans who have little education and live in the hinterland actually feel most free to speak their minds. Perhaps they have simply never been taught that it is wise to keep their mouths shut. </p><p>Far from becoming more comfortable with how to express their views as they become more educated, Americans who go to college appear to learn that they should shut up if they disagree with their peers. As a result, it is not those who feel that they have little to say about politics who have learned to hide their “aberrant” views; rather, it is those who live in the most urban and educated parts of the country.</p><p>Decades ago, Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann wrote about what she called the “Spiral of Silence.” If they dare to speak up, those holding minority viewpoints get rebuffed. To avoid repeating the same unpleasant experience, they demur when the next opportunity to state their opinions presents itself. Pretty soon, a view held by, say, a quarter of the people in a particular group can, in this way, stop being expressed—or heard—at all.&nbsp;</p><p>The spiral of silence need not be instigated by an oppressive government determined to quash dissent. Rather, it can arise spontaneously when the social norms governing interpersonal interactions provide insufficient support for those who are in the minority—either in the country as a whole, or in some local context—to feel comfortable expressing their views. </p><p>That is why high levels of self-censorship should be treated as an ominous warning sign. They signal the development of a culture of orthodoxy that is animated by a false sense of certainty about what is true and what is false—and a proud intolerance of those who might dare to voice an opinion that conflicts with the mainstream. </p><p>The sobering results of our survey suggest that this accurately describes today’s United States.</p><p><strong>James L.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-d2bbad5d87a145e70b5c"><div><blockquote><p><em>  Why your happiness depends on defining enough. </em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596371385949_12013"><div><h4>Who is <a href="https://sivers.org/">Derek Sivers</a>? </h4><p><a href="https://sivers.org/">Derek Sivers</a> is an American entrepreneur and musician (now living in New Zealand) who was the CEO of one of the first digital music stores “CDBaby" in the early 2000s. </p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596282446414_13192"><div><p>Derek Sivers might be one of my favorite writers and entrepreneurs. I came across Derek’s book<strong> </strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2D8GzCL"><strong><em>Anything You Want</em></strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>a few years ago when I was reaching burn out amounts of stress from juggling being a full time teacher in a tough school district, running a coaching business and also trying to be a good husband in a new marriage.&nbsp; </p><p>My goal is to pack as much Sivers wisdom into one spot so you won’t have to go crawling through the internet for it.&nbsp; Enjoy!</p><h4>#1 The Pursuit of Enough&nbsp; </h4><p>It is the inability to define what “enough” is that is society’s greatest cause of unhappiness. We walk around with ideas of success <em>thinking</em> that certain things will bring us lasting joy. Usually what we think we want isn’t even <em>our own idea</em>&nbsp;but was rather planted there by someone or something else.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>Kurt Vonnegut and Joseph Heller were at a party at a billionaire’s extravagant estate. Kurt said, “Wow! Look at this place! This guy has everything!” Joseph said, “Yes, but I have something he’ll never have…Enough." </p></blockquote><p>Just think about it: How many times have you seen some ad for a 17 year old kid telling you the single <em>secret</em>&nbsp;to building wealth from his mom’s basement? How many times have you seen some weird guy in front of a rented leer jet on a YouTube pre-roll ad trying to convince you to invest in Bitcoin? How many times have you seen a sports car and sighed wondering when you will get your big break…?&nbsp; </p><p>As Derek’s success grew monetarily in CD Baby his happiness inversely went down. Is that the case for everyone? No. But, it was the case for Derek and that’s an important lesson to understand.&nbsp; </p><p>The single most important lesson I learned from Derek was to ask myself “Am I doing this because I genuinely want to, or am I doing this to impress an invisible jury that exists only in my head?”</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596312178192_16609"><p><h4>#2 No Roads, Only Directions </h4></p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596280983756_10748"><div><p>When I was being evacuated by the U.S. State Department from Ukraine in 2014 as Russia invaded, I was told probably one of the single most impactful things by my Ukrainian taxi driver to the airport. </p><p>Ukraine spends more money than any other country in Europe on roadwork but still has some of the worst roads (corruption) so as we tried to avoid the pot hole my driver joked: <em>In Ukraine, there are no roads, only directions</em>.&nbsp; </p><p>This is kinda like business: You might think you have all these wonderful schemes, plans and tricks up your sleeve to scale, make money and create incredible products for your clients only to have them quickly blow up in your face. Instead of scheming Derek suggests you simply “answer the cries for help” instead.&nbsp; </p><h4>#3 Hell Yeah! Or Hell No!&nbsp; </h4><p>Deciding what to do in life should meet one metric: If you aren’t saying “Hell Yeah!” It is an automatic “Hell No!”  </p><p>As a peoplepleaser by nature I’ve ignored this advice only to end up hurting relationships, business deals or customer trust in the long run. It comes down to FOMO. We don’t want to miss out on living a larger life so we collect lukewarm commitments that clog up our day too much to make space for rare “Hell Yeah!” opportunities that may pop up.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>“If you’re not saying “<em>Hell yeah!”</em> About something, say no. When deciding whether to do something if you feel anything less than “Wow! That would be amazing! Absolutely! Hell yeah!” Then say no. When you say no to most things, you leave room in your life to throw yourself completely into that rare thing that makes you say “<em>Hell yeah!</em>”&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>It seems that in some cases, you may need to say Yes to things that don’t make you say “Hell Yes” to at least break into a particular sphere or develop relationships. </p><p>The latte boy in the DC lobbyist office doesn’t necessarily want to be everyone’s errand boy, but he knows that a year well spent networking will set him up for what he really wants to do in the long run: deal making. The unpaid graduate assistant coach sleeping on the couch in the locker room of an SEC football program probably has a girlfriend wondering what the heck he is doing, but he knows he is there for the network first.&nbsp; </p><p>Again, the root of this idea is defining enough - defining the limits of what makes you energized and what drains you.&nbsp; </p><h4>#4 Execution, Execution, Execution </h4><p>Steve Jobs wasn’t the first person to try making a smartphone. Uber wasn’t the first ride sharing app idea. Tesla wasn’t the first electric car idea (in fact electric car plans have been around as long as the Model T Ford). It was their execution on these ideas that turned these good ideas into good businesses.&nbsp; </p><p>Good ideas aren’t automatically good businesses.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>…ideas are worth nothing unless they are executed. They are just a multiplier. Execution is worth millions…To make a business, you need to multiply the two components. </p></blockquote><p>I have been such a reflector in my own life - filling up tombs of journals and notebooks with ideas, theories and notes but it dawned on me looking at all these notebooks: <em>Where was the execution?</em> &nbsp;What if instead of sitting on 1.5hr’s of reading and notes per day I decided to ship, publish and take action instead? I think some reflection is healthy. But I’ve often used idea formation as a crutch to excuse my own inaction. </p><h4>#5 The Market Wants What <em>It</em> &nbsp;Wants </h4><p>It’s important to tinker early and often because you won’t know what people like until you put something in front of them to accept or reject. In <a href="https://brendancahill.io/brensblog/seth">Seth Godin’s marketing work </a>and in my own experience it is abundantly clear that people aren’t always rational. Even if they <em>say</em>&nbsp;they would pay x amount for your product or idea you just won’t know if that’s true until they do.&nbsp; </p><p>So, until your market buys it hasn’t bought. </p><p>Until your course receives sign ups the market doesn’t want it. Until your consulting service is used the market doesn’t want it. This is why it's important to iterate nimbly. Don’t sink all you money into developing a product that people <em>only say</em>&nbsp;is a good idea.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>It’s only a good idea if they buy.&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>Derek talks about how <em>what he thought</em>&nbsp;CDBaby did was <em>very</em>&nbsp;different from what his paying customers thought it did. He thought “it was just a credit card processing service” but it turned out his clients saw CDBaby as a democratized online CD storefront.&nbsp; </p><p>In my own coaching business I <em>thought</em>&nbsp;was just coaching high school kids how to kick better, but overwhelmingly the parents and players I worked with saw my business as helping them navigate the weird world of college football recruiting.&nbsp; </p><p>What you think your business does isn’t usually what your customers think it does. Why your customers come to you usually isn’t why you think they come to you. Be ready to pivot.&nbsp; </p><h4>#6 The Best Way To Grow Isn’t To Grow.&nbsp; </h4><p>You’ve earned a certain level of trust with your current customers. They love you. They think whatever you’re doing is better than sliced bread. You are giving them oxygen as they gasp for air. You are making them happy. You are helping them live a fuller life. Yet, what do most businesses try to do the second they taste moderate success? Grow.&nbsp; </p><p>Growth isn’t bad, but how it is done is often a problem. They seek to find new clients. Maybe higher paying ones. Maybe ones in different areas. Maybe to break into a <em>new</em>&nbsp;market. But more revenue usually just means more liability, more expenses and less of <em>you</em>&nbsp;to go around to your true fans who love you.&nbsp; </p><p>Of course, this selfish pursuit of growth is justified as selflessness by believing that as a bigger business you can somehow now better meet the needs and wants of your <em>current</em>&nbsp;clients. But really, growth is going to take your focus further away from them.&nbsp; </p><p>If you really want to grow, focus solely on your preexisting clients. </p><blockquote><p>None of your customers will ask you to turn your attention to expanding. They want you to keep your attention focused on them.</p></blockquote><p>The more my own businesses have grown and the more the businesses of my friends have grown the more headaches they’ve experienced.&nbsp; </p><p>Instead of trying to grow your business in volume or quantity grow it qualitatively.&nbsp; </p><p>Your current clients are going to be your best source of newer clients anyway.&nbsp; </p><h4>#7 Exclude! </h4><p>You can’t be all things to everyone. Yet, many business owners do exactly that. When you are trying to gain traction you market to everyone, take every call, take every appointment, and will be overeager to close new sales. The problem is no one wants to be at a club that lets <em>just anyone</em>&nbsp;in - not even you.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>Have the confidence to know that when your target 1 percent hears you excluding the other 99 percent, the people in that 1 percent will come to you because you’ve shown how much you value them.&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>Being exclusive is a long term game you want to play with long term true fan customers. It will feel in the moment like you are saying no to more money, which you technically are, but in the long term you are actually saving yourself more in money and customer happiness.&nbsp; </p><p>Let’s say you let one lousy customer in who you know isn’t a good fit but, since they are willing to pay you a lot you say yes anyway. This customer then calls you day and night, berates your sales staff and sucks the air out of your limited time and attention for the customers you actually <em>do</em>&nbsp;enjoy working with. In fact, you’ve become so distracted that a few of your true fan clients have drifted away to other competitors now. Now this lousy customer has cost you money instead of making you any.&nbsp; </p><p>It’s a fine line between being polarizing enough to rally your 1% troops and appearing crazy or arrogant. It’s only really up to the business owner to know the difference. But, everyone likes to have their own private club. You can give that to them.&nbsp; </p><h4>#8 There’s No Right Way (Which Might Be Wrong)</h4><p>I used to think my heroes playing in the NFL growing up were super men, different, or unique, but through my business I’ve met and made friends with quite a few of them. They’re just like …</p></div></div></div>

		</header>
		  <p>This three instrument âˆ¿ðŸŽ·ðŸŽ¹ piano supports play with both keyboard and mouse!
The keyboard setup mirrors the onscreen piano keyboard and allows playing simultaneous notes.
Keys light up red when played and can be held for any length of time.

Thanks to Rodrigo Siqueira for helping prototype this!

Simple Mod Ideas...
- Option to change wave shape with oscillator.type
- Octave and Root Key control
- More instruments try `456` for a major chord</p>

		</header>
		  <p>A roundish game about avoiding things flying your way. Your score increases over time, so does the difficulty. Keep calm and don't go too close to the edge of the playfield.

The focus of this project was to have satisfying controls and a polished gameplay, however simplistic it may be.

[h]Controls[/h]

 - Move using the [b]arrow[/b] keys
 - Accelerate faster with the [b]X[/b] key
 - Restart the game using the [b]R[/b] key once you're hit

You are a merman ðŸ§œðŸ�½â€�â™‚ï¸� with an unlimited supply of harpoons ðŸ”±. Fishes ðŸ¦�ðŸ�¡ðŸ�&nbsp; somehow bounce around the seabed... What would you do? Split them in halves!

This is a version of Pang ([link]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pang_(video_game)[/link]) in 1024 bytes of JavaScript with p5.js. Erik Sombroek ([link]https://twitter.com/eriksombroek[/link]) wrote the original version with an inspiration from [em]Bubble Trouble[/em] and Kang Seonghoon ([link]https://twitter.com/senokay[/link]) minified it to fit the size.

[b]Controls[/b]

The game starts when you start moving around.

â€¢ Left/right arrow to control the merman  
â€¢ Space to shoot a harpoon  
â€¢ Enter to restart the game (even in-game)

[b]Bonuses[/b]

For each hit there is a 10% chance of bonuses. They disappear after 5 bounces, so hurry up!

â€¢ Heart ðŸ’�: You are safe from fishes for one hit.  
â€¢ Clock â�°: Everything except you and your harpoon slows down for 10 seconds.  
â€¢ Star â­�: You can shoot multiple harpoons for 10 seconds.

[b]Technical[/b]

The code was minified with Terser ([link]https://github.com/terser/terser[/link]) and RegPack ([link]https://siorki.github.io/regPack.html[/link]). The actual job is done via a (then) custom version of Terser-online ([link]https://xem.github.io/terser-online/[/link]) with tons of pre- and postprocessing code.

All sprites are done with emoji. Unfortunately different platforms have different emoji fonts, as a result the graphics might be slightly off. It should look well in macOS and reasonably well in Windows, both tested in Chrome and Firefox.</p>

		  <p>Move and attack with arrow keys.
Everything has 8hp.
Your attacks always hit and do d6 damage.
Enemy attacks do 1 damage (except certain enemies, see below), and have hit chance depending on relative levels.
Digging dirt or diamonds also costs 1hp per strike.
Levels are color coded blue=&gt;green=&gt;yellow=&gt;orange=&gt;red.
Defeating an enemy gives you 3xp for enemies below your level, 5xp for enemies of your level,
and 5xp more per each level above.
The victory also gives you 1 hp.
Digging up diamonds gives you 15 xp, but no hp.
You level up when you get 100 xp.
  
The goal is to reach the stairs at the bottom right corner.
  
OBELISK restores your hp to the max when defeated.
WOLF has no special traits.
SKELETON does not restore your hp.
WARRIOR takes 1 less damage from your attacks.
AXE GOBLIN has reduced hit chance but deals 2 damage.
FIRE ELEMENTAL self-destructs on a successful attack, removing 2 of your hp.
WIZARD deals and takes double damage.

I always wanted to participate such little competition, but not against others, but against myself. 
This little game is dedicated to my new baby born: Nikki of course :-).

All in pure JS, HTML and CSS with a fluid display.

Please use the arrow keys to "enjoy" the cleaning and have the highest score!

Enjoy :-)</p>

		  <p>Rocket simulation near a planet

[b]How to play[/b]
- Set its orbit so that it touches target.
- New target will be set after old target has been reached.
- The game is over when the rocket falls to the planet.

[b]Controls[/b]
- Up arrow: throttle forward
- Down arrow: throttle backward
- Left arrow: turn left
- Right arrow: turn right
- W key: toggle prograde facing

[b]Note[/b]
Same with any physics game, any lag/glitch may cause your rocket to go to the infinity and beyond. :P

[b]Tools[/b]
- RegPack v5.0.3
- Google Closure Compiler</p>

According to market research firm IDC, companies end up <a href="https://www.dummies.com/business/human-resources/workplace/how-inefficiency-negatively-impacts-your-business/">losing 20 to 30 percent in revenue every year due to inefficiencies</a>. And that, of course, is a lot!</p><blockquote>Seemingly small and invisible inefficiencies within your development workflow compound over time, cause a dip in productivity, and ultimately lead to unhappy customers.</blockquote><p>Issues in your workflow may seem small at first, but without special attention, they add up, and become extremely apparent over time.</p><p>Over the past couple of years, we've built a collaborative workflow that brings together members from across functions and ship quality features and make customers happy. This guide will walk you through our development workflow and how we think about it at Zepel.</p><hr><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h2 id="what-causes-inefficiencies-in-the-software-development-workflow">What causes inefficiencies in the software development workflow?</h2><p><em>Because how can you improve your workflow if you don’t know what to improve upon in the first place?</em></p><p>Like many teams, we made the mistake of thinking, “<em>Setting a workflow is about moving tasks and user stories from one column to another”</em>. And boy, we couldn’t have been more wrong.</p><blockquote>A software development workflow isn’t about moving cards from one column to another. It’s all the invisible flow of information too!</blockquote><p>Let’s look at the 3 causes for a broken software development workflow:</p><h3 id="1-laser-focussed-on-a-specific-task">1. Laser focussed on a specific task</h3><p>In the last 10 years, far too many project management tools have been pushing the notion that you need to focus on just the things you care about.</p><p>Sure, that’s important. But software development isn’t just about checking off tasks. After all, the best developers are the ones who can focus on the fine implementation details while still having a picture of the broader purposes of the feature as a whole.</p><p>By being laser focussed on just the tasks assigned to themselves, development teams miss the forest for the trees.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/C9QalsL2dWHcIS4pt-wUcs-PabXPLgiEK9a2s44cC04GbF850a7p119smKglGDo6dkVr4yHSg5E-Ru6ZZXoA6f4jPvedEKVOKCrXsCM8H-HfO23x2YukjSRp6Ke5x5mQx4jQbvsH" alt="The multiple challenges and needs of project management"><figcaption>The pyramid of development tracking needs</figcaption></figure><h3 id="2-greater-emphasis-on-the-process-than-productivity">2. Greater emphasis on the process than productivity</h3><p>While processes are great, we must understand they’re put in place to help your team stay productive and produce a desirable outcome. A mistake many teams make is overemphasizing teams to follow a process when it isn’t helping.</p><p>A good example of this can be seen when teams implement agile processes by the book in the hope of making their team <em>agile</em>. It’s important to keep in mind that processes need to be built with people in mind. And not with rules.</p><p>What good is a process if it hinders your team from being nimble and moving fast anyway?</p><h3 id="3-building-complex-rigid-workflows-to-get-updates-at-every-step">3. Building complex, rigid workflows to get updates at every step</h3><p>Workflows are simple when a team is small. As teams grow, the first thing that gets introduced is complexity. Developers and designers work in silos, without any awareness of what the other team was working on.</p><p>As each phase of the software development occurs in different tools and key pieces of information is lost when teams handoff. </p><p>To keep the development workflow in motion, you need a seamless hand-over between teams. And this needs to happen while each of them focuses on the task at hand without losing sight of the big picture.</p><hr><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h2 id="an-improved-development-workflow">An improved development workflow</h2><p>Contrary to common misunderstanding, software development is a dynamic structure and is rarely static. A considerable effort is needed as new functionalities or constraints are added to the system.</p><p>This means, there are far too many moving parts to consider that simple task and issue tracking tools just don’t fall short.</p><p>The development workflow when building software needs to allow teams to achieve three things:</p><ol><li><strong>Get visibility at a specific task and the broader picture.</strong></li><li><strong>Reduce complexity by not having to set up configurations and stitched processes.</strong></li><li><strong>Reduce tools to streamline the process, so team members don’t have to be clueless about where to look for the most recent information.</strong></li></ol><p>The aim was to connect a deeper, connected workflow that allowed the team to do deep work by collaborating cross-functionally and get all the context they needed.</p><p>Naturally, we use <a href="https://zepel.io/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=development-workflow">Zepel</a> to improve our development workflow and here’s how we did it. Let’s dive in and look at it step-by-step.</p><h3 id="eliminate-ambiguity-by-creating-alignment-">Eliminate ambiguity by creating alignment.</h3><p>Delivering quality features at every interaction requires alignment from multiple teams and it shouldn’t be a passive process. At Zepel, everything starts with bringing everyone up to speed on the priorities. That means, sharing with the team on the features we need to be working on in the coming weeks and months.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/03/sprint-planning-roadmap.png" alt="Get a quick overview of the roadmap and track progress with Kanban view of all features"><figcaption>Get a quick overview of the roadmap and track its progress</figcaption></figure><p>Based on the conversations our product team has with the customers and the business needs, the most important features are moved to the top of the todo column. A duration and an owner are set later on after the feature is spec’d and we have an estimate from the development team.</p><p><strong>This gives every single member a complete picture of what our priorities are, even when things change due to unforeseen circumstances.</strong></p><h3 id="think-big-start-small-">Think big, start small.</h3><p>Once the top priority features are prioritized, the product manager jumps in to drill into the specifics of all the functionalities of the feature by writing detailed user stories, tasks, and enhancements. And how each functionality should behave by writing detailed acceptance criteria as descriptions.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/03/updated-list-of-user-stories-for-sprint-planning.png" alt="A list of user stories, tasks, subtasks, bugs, and enhancements"><figcaption>A list of user stories, bugs, enhancements, tasks, and subtasks</figcaption></figure><p>We group and categorize user stories and tasks under Sections to make it easier to understand for anyone new whom we might collaborate.</p><p><strong>This view makes it easy for the product manager to plan features. And gives them (and anyone who’s collaborated later on) a neat document-like view of what the feature is really about.</strong></p><h3 id="putting-an-end-to-countless-what-s-the-update-">Putting an end to countless “What’s the update?”</h3><p>After the feature is spec’d and all user stories are written, we plan and add prioritized items into the <a href="https://zepel.io/features/sprints/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=development-workflow">Sprint</a>. By now, all the planning is complete and we're in the execution mode. At this stage, we assign specific user stories and tasks.</p><p>One thing we’re still learning and trying to understand is if it’s okay to add an item to a sprint after it has begun. There are tons of opinions on this one on the internet and we’re still figuring what works for us in this aspect. :)</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/03/sprint-planning-template.png" alt="Tracking the development using Sprint"><figcaption>Tracking the progress of a sprint</figcaption></figure><p>Since Zepel has a dedicated Sprint view, our team gets all the updates about that specific Sprint in one place — burndown charts, burnup charts, sprint overview, scrum board, and sprint backlog.</p><p>Before the Sprint begins, the development team makes sure they’ve configured Zepel’s GitHub integration to automate their work based on their <a href="https://zepel.io/blog/5-git-workflows-to-improve-development/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=development-workflow">Git Workflows</a>. This allows them to just focus on their work, so they don’t have to come back to the app every time they need to provide an update.</p><p><em>Note: If you're not a GitHub user, <a href="https://zepel.io/guide/integrations/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=development-workflow">Zepel also integrates with Bitbucket and GitLab</a>.</em></p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/01/zepel-git-workflow-automation.png" alt="GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab integration in Zepel"><figcaption>Automating Zepel to update statuses based on Git development workflow.</figcaption></figure><p>As the Sprint progresses and the development team makes progress, our product person and engineering head can quickly open up specific items to see all their Git activity inside Zepel. This gives them a snapshot of the progress at a specific item.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-13-at-10.58.06-AM.png" alt="Zepel integration with GitHub, BitBucket, and GitLab"><figcaption>Real-time updates on every commit, pull request, and branch changes.</figcaption></figure><p>Since we’ve already enabled Slack integration, every time a developer adds a commit, merges a branch, or opens a PR, statuses are automatically updated in Zepel and everyone is automatically notified through Slack.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/04/zepel-git-developer-workflow.png" alt="Developer Workflow with GitHub, Zepel, and Slack Integrations"><figcaption>A simple flowchart of how developer workflow is automated with GitHub, Zepel, and Slack</figcaption></figure><p><strong>This gives our development team the freedom to work from within their code editor and GitHub, and not worry about updating progress. </strong></p><h3 id="collaboration-alone-isn-t-enough-enable-seamless-handoff-">Collaboration alone isn’t enough. Enable seamless handoff.</h3><p>In software development, collaborating within a dev team isn’t enough. You need to be able to collaborate cross-functionally and hand-over information. This is critical because, without the right information and context, everyone will be working with different assumptions, leading to a delay in the feature release.</p><p>For small teams, this could be a single <a href="https://zepel.io/kanban-software/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=development-workflow">Kanban board</a> with four or five statuses. In this case, the team composition is primarily the developers with probably one designer or a QA person in the mix.</p><p>However, if you’re a bigger team and have more members involved in building the feature, having a single board with ten status columns to accommodate every function will not be efficient.</p><p>To combat this, we add a board for each team. Like in any board, we move each user story from one column to another. Unlike other tools, Zepel's <a href="https://zepel.io/kanban-software/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=development-workflow">kanban board software</a> also allows us to move a <a href="https://zepel.io/agile/user-stories/">user story</a> from one board to another when we want to collaborate cross-functionally.</p><p><strong>This allows our designer to move a user story from Design board to Dev board’s Todo column once the designer has the final version of the design ready.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/04/multiple-boards.png" alt="Boards in Zepel"><figcaption>Adding …</figcaption></figure></div></div>

                <div>
                    <p>The short answer is yes. Let me explain.</p><p>I’ve been working with developers and designers my entire life. </p><p>I’ve built a couple of products, worked at a young startup, and I’m now at Zepel helping development teams build better software.</p><p>I’ve spoken to 1000+ development teams while at Zepel alone. <strong>And it's evident that the way we build products is broken.</strong></p><p>There’s so much disconnect between how you and I talk about building products and how our teams actually build them.</p><p>For all the talk of scrum and agile and getting feedback quickly, there’s so much that’s broken in how we act on the feedback and build the feature.</p><p>Teams spend so much time and effort getting a deeper understanding of customers’ needs. And yet distil everything down to a simple two-line ticket and a couple of lines of markdown description.</p><p>This is hurting your developers. And it’s hurting your business.</p><blockquote>Nothing is more frustrating than having to understand what an entire feature should or shouldn’t do from a two-line ticket filled with ten bullet points of acceptance criteria.</blockquote><p><em>*Here are five prioritized tickets for the upcoming sprint. We have to ship them on time!*</em></p><p>On the other hand, you have teams who are able to build top quality software. They’re the ones who can concentrate on the fine implementation details without losing focus on the broader purpose of the feature as a whole.</p><p>Everyone wants to get to that level. But instead, teams do the exact opposite.</p><p><strong>Teams think in issues and tickets, instead of the feature as a system.</strong></p><hr><h2 id="development-teams-are-not-ticket-movers-">Development teams are not ticket movers!</h2><p>Today, everything is about moving a ticket from “Todo” to “Done” as quick as possible. And watching <a href="https://zepel.io/agile/reports/burndown/">burndown charts</a>. And customizing the tool to the extent that the developer only views a single ticket.</p><p><em>*“What’s the velocity of our team?” is simply another way of asking how quickly can my team move an issue from “Todo” to “Done”.*</em></p><p>Pieces of that stuff are important for productivity and shipping on time.</p><p>But seriously, how is your team supposed to ship anything of value if you narrow their focus down to the smallest unit of work without any context of why it’s needed or how it connects to the whole feature?!</p><p>Overall, we’ve lost our way. Product development today has become more about checking items off a list as quickly as possible. </p><p><strong>It isn’t enough to write multiple user stories and share a Figma link if you want to ship quality software.</strong></p><hr><h2 id="how-software-product-teams-really-build-software-together">How software product teams really build software together</h2><p>Development teams build better software together when they have the complete context of what and why something is being built.</p><p>To achieve this, the foundational elements need to change.</p><p>And it starts with getting the right abstractions and naming conventions.</p><p><strong>The names you choose determine the perception and the quality of conversations you have. </strong>It’s why top developers spend time obsessing over names for classes, functions, and variables.</p><p>When you open up a VS Code and see a function called <code>send_signup_email</code>, you have a certain sense of what’s going to be inside and why that’s there.</p><p>The right abstractions can drive the team towards asking the right questions. And this is critical.</p><p><strong>Because when you’re tracking issues and tickets in isolation you have no choice but to measure only outputs.</strong></p><p>And teams today don’t want to measure only the outputs. They want to measure <em>outcomes</em>.</p><hr><h2 id="what-s-the-right-abstraction">What’s the right abstraction?</h2><p>The right abstraction is the one that prioritizes people over processes and tools. It's the one you and I use every day — it's Features.</p><p>When a squad creates a Feature and opens it, they’ll get to look at the entire feature as a unit. A <a href="https://zepel.io/agile/user-stories/">user story</a> inside it might describe a specific functionality. But the difference is, now each developer and designer know how it connects to the larger scheme of things for the entire feature.</p><blockquote>A feature forces inept managers to stop focussing on output-oriented questions like “how can we work faster”. <p>And shifts the focus on outcome-oriented questions like “why should we prioritize this feature” and “how does this feature tie to the OKR”.</p></blockquote><p>Miscellaneous tasks and incoming bugs can be tracked on a separate “List”, so high-priority bugs don't get missed out. And of course, when it comes to tracking them, they can all be tracked on a Sprint or on a Kanban Board.</p><p><strong>Feature as an abstraction is the right middle ground that lets you focus on the output as well as the outcome.</strong> It lets you zoom in and track what's happening today. It also allows you to zoom out and track a feature's progress across multiple disciplines. And it enables you to see how a feature moves from a feature request all the way to prioritization and development.</p><p>Simple issue trackers and project management tools have shoehorned teams into ticket-movers and have made them think in outputs. Metrics get feigned to show productivity. Thinking in outcomes has become ridiculously hard. And it's hurting businesses.</p><p>It's time for tools to reflect the reality of product development. It's time to remove the disconnect between development teams and what your customers really want. </p><p>It's time to stop thinking in isolated tickets and start thinking in features as a system!</p><hr><p>If you liked what you read, I think you’ll love what we have in store for you.

August 1, 2020 | https://vadimdemedes.com/posts/ink-3 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://vadimdemedes.com/posts/ink-3">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><a href="http://term.ink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ink 3</a> is available today.
Ink lets you build command-line apps using React and have fun while doing so too.</p><p>Ink is a special project to me, because it's been surreal to watch how a tiny experiment grew into a full-featured command-line UI toolkit that's used by <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gatsby</a>, <a href="https://parceljs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parcel</a>, <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yarn</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terraform</a>, <a href="https://node-tap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tap</a>, <a href="https://www.prisma.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prisma</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-react/tree/master/scripts/splash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shopify</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/kyt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#whos-using-ink" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many others</a>.
I had no idea it had such a great future when I was just playing with React trying to make it render things to a string and output it in the terminal.</p><p>I'm excited to share all the updates with you, so let's dive right in to see what Ink 3 has to offer.</p><p>While it's not so much of a feature, I think it deserves a top spot.
People loved using React to declaratively build UIs for their command-line apps, but sometimes it ended up hurting their end performance.
For example, <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gatsby</a> noticed their build process slowed down, which is obviously not the tradeoff I want Ink's users to accept.</p><p>Ink 3 got rid of quite a few rendering bugs and in some cases I observed a 2x performance improvement when there's a high frequency of re-renders.
Text rendering and the whole support for Flexbox was rethinked from the ground up and rewritten.
It's also much simpler than it was before, which makes issues easier to debug, reproduce and solve.</p><p>Previous version of Ink had multiple hacky workarounds for various layout issues, so it didn't always render what you would expect.
Ink 3 should be a significant improvement in that area.</p><p>Previously you had to use a separate <code>&lt;Color&gt;</code> component for applying color to text.

Think of <code>&lt;Static&gt;</code> as a terminal-specific implementation for a <a href="http://www.reactvirtualized.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">virtual list</a> technique, where only necessary items are rendered.
<code>&lt;Static&gt;</code> renders all new items above the rest of your UI permanently, which means you can't update them once they are displayed.
This makes <code>&lt;Static&gt;</code> a perfect candidate for tools like Jest, where hundreds of completed tests could need to be logged.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Static</span><span> </span><span>items</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>[</span><span>'Test #1'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>'Test #2'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>'Test #3'</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  </span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>test</span><span>,</span><span> index</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span> </span><span>key</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>index</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>color</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>green</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>      Completed </span><span>{</span><span>test</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Static</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre></div><p>In Ink 3, <code>&lt;Static&gt;</code> is almost twice as performant as it was before and API has been simplified to match libraries like <a href="https://github.com/clauderic/react-tiny-virtual-list" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">react-tiny-virtual-list</a>.</p><p>Here's an example of a UI similar to Jest, where completed tests are rendered using <code>&lt;Static&gt;</code>.</p><video src="https://vadimdemedes.com/ink-3/static.mp4" muted="" autoplay="" loop="" playsinline="" width="500"></video><p>Learn more about <a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#static" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>&lt;Static&gt;</code> component</a>.</p><p>Yes, you read that right.
You can use React Devtools to inspect the output of your Ink app.
The magical bit is that you can actually change the props of any component and see your CLI update on the fly without having to restart it.</p><p><img src="https://vadimdemedes.com/ink-3/devtools.jpg" alt="Integration with React Devtools"><span>Integration with React Devtools</span></p><p>You don't need to make any changes to support it, just set <code>DEV=true</code> environment variable and open Devtools:</p><div><pre>$ DEV=true node examples/counter
$ npx react-devtools
</pre></div><p>When one of your components throws an error, React displays a quite verbose error message to the console and a long stack trace.
Most often that stack trace isn't super useful, because it points to React internals.</p><p>Ink 3 offers a simpler and cleaner solution to this problem by defining a global React <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">error boundary</a> and rendering a beautiful overview of the error.</p><p><img src="https://vadimdemedes.com/ink-3/errors.jpg" alt="Error handler UI"><span>Error handler UI</span></p><p>To improve developer UX further, Ink 3 intercepts calls to <code>console.log</code>, <code>console.error</code> and other methods to ensure logs are displayed correctly above your app's UI and not interfere with each other.
This is necessary, because Ink re-renders your UI all the time, which can overwrite the output from <code>console.log</code>.</p><p>If your app has more than one user input displayed at once, it can become tricky to detect which input has the focus and should receive data.
To make this easier, Ink offers two new React hooks:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#usefocusoptions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>useFocus</code></a> - Receive focus.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#usefocusmanager" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>useFocusManager</code></a> - Manage focus programmatically.</li></ul><p>When component calls <code>useFocus</code> hook, it notifies Ink that there's a new focusable component in the UI.
Each time user presses Tab, Ink is going to pass focus to the next focusable component in the queue.</p><div><pre><p><span>1 </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>First</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2 </span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>isFocused</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>useFocus</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>3 </span><span></span></p><p><span>4 </span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>5 </span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>6 </span><span>      </span><span>{</span><span>isFocused </span><span>?</span><span> </span><span>'First item is focused'</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'First item is not focused'</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>7 </span><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>8 </span><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>9 </span><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>Second</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>isFocused</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>useFocus</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span></span></p><p><span>14</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>15</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>16</span><span>      </span><span>{</span><span>isFocused </span><span>?</span><span> </span><span>'Second item is focused'</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'Second item is not focused'</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>17</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>18</span><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>19</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>20</span><span></span></p><p><span>21</span><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>Example</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>22</span><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>23</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>First</span><span> </span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>24</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Second</span><span> </span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>25</span><span>  </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>26</span><span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div><p>In the example above, as user presses Tab, focus will be passed back and forth between <code>First</code> and <code>Second</code> components.</p><p>When your app needs to manage focus manually, without waiting on user input, you can use <code>useFocusManager</code> hook.

        <p>There’s an italian Facebook page called “<strong>Il Programmatore di Merda</strong>” (which can be translated to “<strong>The Shitty Programmer</strong>”). I love that page.</p>
<p>They often share shitty pieces of code and memes about programming, but today I’ve seen something quite incredible:</p>

Security issues
</h2>
<p>We are pretty sure that the following code is running on the client side, ’cause it’s wrapped between two <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags (also, is using jQuery).<br>
Don’t get me wrong, it would have been terrible even on the server side, but running that code on the client exposes your database to… everyone.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the <code>authenticateUser</code> function:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>function</span> <span>authenticateUser</span>(username<span>,</span> password) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a>  <span>var</span> accounts <span>=</span> <span>apiService</span>.<span>sql</span>(</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3"></a>    <span>"SELECT * FROM users"</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4"></a>  )<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb2-5"><a href="#cb2-5"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-6"><a href="#cb2-6"></a>  <span>for</span> (<span>var</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> i <span>&lt;</span> <span>accounts</span>.<span>length</span><span>;</span> i<span>++</span>) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb2-7"><a href="#cb2-7"></a>    <span>var</span> account <span>=</span> accounts [i]<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb2-8"><a href="#cb2-8"></a>    <span>if</span> (<span>account</span>.<span>username</span> <span>===</span> username <span>&amp;&amp;</span></span>
<span id="cb2-9"><a href="#cb2-9"></a>        <span>account</span>.<span>password</span> <span>===</span> password)</span>
<span id="cb2-10"><a href="#cb2-10"></a>    <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb2-11"><a href="#cb2-11"></a>      <span>return</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb2-12"><a href="#cb2-12"></a>    <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb2-13"><a href="#cb2-13"></a>  <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb2-14"><a href="#cb2-14"></a>  <span>if</span> (<span>"true"</span> <span>===</span> <span>"true"</span>) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb2-15"><a href="#cb2-15"></a>    <span>return</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb2-16"><a href="#cb2-16"></a>  <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb2-17"><a href="#cb2-17"></a><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>We have a function somewhere called <code>apiServices</code> which exposes a <code>.sql</code> method, where you can run SQL queries against the database.<br>
That means that if you open the console on the web page that is hosting the above code, you’ll be able to spawn every kind of query.<br>
</p>
<p>You could do something like that:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a><span>apiService</span>.<span>sql</span>(<span>"show tables;"</span>)<span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>and it will return the complete list of their database tables by using their own APIs.<br>
But hey, ok, let’s pretend that this is not a real problem. But take a look at that:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a><span>if</span> (<span>account</span>.<span>username</span> <span>===</span> username <span>&amp;&amp;</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2"></a>    <span>account</span>.<span>password</span> <span>===</span> password)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>so you’re telling me that you’re saving all the passwords without hashing them?<br>
Great move! Now I can attach a debugger to the Chrome console and see every user’s password.<br>
I’m also pretty sure that an high percentage of users uses the same username/password tuple for social networks, email services, bank accounts and so on.</p>

<p>There’s also a problem on how they’re trying to setup the <code>loggedin</code> cookie:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1"></a><span>$</span>.<span>cookie</span>(<span>'loggedin'</span><span>,</span> <span>'yes'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>expires</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span>)<span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>So they’re basically using jQuery for setting a cookie which tells to the web application if a user is authenticated or not.<br>
</p>
<p>Well, <strong>NEVER SET THIS KIND OF COOKIES USING JAVASCRIPT</strong>.</p>
<p>If you need to store that kind of information, cookies are the most common choice, and that’s ok! But setting them using JavaScript means that you cannot set the <code>httpOnly</code> attribute, so every single malevolent script will gain access to your cookies.</p>
<p>Yes, I know, they’re just storing a key value like <code>'loggedin': 'yes'</code>, so that’s not the case, but that’s a very bad practice.</p>
<p>Also, opening my Chrome console I could always type <code>$.cookie('loggedin', 'yes', { expires: 1000000000000 });</code> and I will stay loggedin forever without even have an account.</p>
<h2 id="basic-programming-knowledge">
Basic programming knowledge
</h2>
<p>There are so many things to say and so little time.<br>
Obviously the <code>authenticateUser</code> function is pure garbage, and it shows some lacks of basic programming knowledge.&nbsp;</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1"></a><span>function</span> <span>authenticateUser</span>(username<span>,</span> password) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2"></a>  <span>var</span> accounts <span>=</span> <span>apiService</span>.<span>sql</span>(</span>
<span id="cb6-3"><a href="#cb6-3"></a>    <span>"SELECT * FROM users"</span></span>

<span id="cb6-5"><a href="#cb6-5"></a></span>
<span id="cb6-6"><a href="#cb6-6"></a>  <span>for</span> (<span>var</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> i <span>&lt;</span> <span>accounts</span>.<span>length</span><span>;</span> i<span>++</span>) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb6-7"><a href="#cb6-7"></a>    <span>var</span> account <span>=</span> accounts [i]<span>;</span></span>

<span id="cb6-9"><a href="#cb6-9"></a>        <span>account</span>.<span>password</span> <span>===</span> password)</span>
<span id="cb6-10"><a href="#cb6-10"></a>    <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb6-11"><a href="#cb6-11"></a>      <span>return</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb6-12"><a href="#cb6-12"></a>    <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb6-13"><a href="#cb6-13"></a>  <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb6-14"><a href="#cb6-14"></a>  <span>if</span> (<span>"true"</span> <span>===</span> <span>"true"</span>) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb6-15"><a href="#cb6-15"></a>    <span>return</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb6-16"><a href="#cb6-16"></a>  <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb6-17"><a href="#cb6-17"></a><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Instead of selecting every single user inside of the database, why doesn’t he/she select just the user with a given username and a given password?<br>
What if he/she had millions of users in that database?<br>
</p>
<p>I’ve said before and I’ll say it again, <strong>why they’re not hashing passwords inside of their database?</strong></p>
<p>Let’s move on to the returning value of <code>authenticateUser</code>.<br>
For what I see, it takes two arguments of type <code>string</code> and returns a single <code>boolean</code> value.<br>
</p>
<p>So, the following piece of code, even being awful, makes a bit of sense:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1"></a><span>for</span> (<span>var</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> i <span>&lt;</span> <span>accounts</span>.<span>length</span><span>;</span> i<span>++</span>) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2"></a>  <span>var</span> account <span>=</span> accounts [i]<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb7-3"><a href="#cb7-3"></a>  <span>if</span> (<span>account</span>.<span>username</span> <span>===</span> username <span>&amp;&amp;</span></span>
<span id="cb7-4"><a href="#cb7-4"></a>      <span>account</span>.<span>password</span> <span>===</span> password)</span>
<span id="cb7-5"><a href="#cb7-5"></a>  <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb7-6"><a href="#cb7-6"></a>    <span>return</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb7-7"><a href="#cb7-7"></a>  <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb7-8"><a href="#cb7-8"></a><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>“does an user with <em><strong>X</strong></em> username and <em><strong>Y</strong></em> password exists? Yes, so I’ll return <code>true</code>”.<br>
But this:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1"></a><span>if</span> (<span>"true"</span> <span>===</span> <span>"true"</span>) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2"><a href="#cb8-2"></a>  <span>return</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb8-3"><a href="#cb8-3"></a><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This doesn’t make sense at all.<br>
Why doesn’t this function return <code>false</code> without this always-true conditional?</p>
<p>Now let’s analyze the following code:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1"></a><span>$</span>(<span>'#login'</span>).<span>click</span>(<span>function</span>() <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2"><a href="#cb9-2"></a>  <span>var</span> username <span>=</span> <span>$</span>(<span>"#username"</span>).<span>val</span>()<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-3"><a href="#cb9-3"></a>  <span>var</span> password <span>=</span> <span>$</span>(<span>"#password"</span>).<span>val</span>()<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-4"><a href="#cb9-4"></a></span>
<span id="cb9-5"><a href="#cb9-5"></a>  <span>var</span> authenticated <span>=</span> <span>authenticateUser</span>(username<span>,</span> password)<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-6"><a href="#cb9-6"></a></span>
<span id="cb9-7"><a href="#cb9-7"></a>  <span>if</span> (authenticated <span>===</span> <span>true</span>) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb9-8"><a href="#cb9-8"></a>    <span>$</span>.<span>cookie</span>(<span>'loggedin'</span><span>,</span> <span>'yes'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>expires</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span>)<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-9"><a href="#cb9-9"></a>  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>if</span> (authenticated <span>===</span> <span>false</span>) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb9-10"><a href="#cb9-10"></a>    <span>$</span>(<span>"error_message"</span>).<span>show</span>(LogInFailed)<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-11"><a href="#cb9-11"></a>  <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb9-12"><a href="#cb9-12"></a><span>}</span>)<span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The part where it’s taking the values using jQuery is ok.<br>
The problem is how it’s handling the <code>loggedin</code> cookie.<br>
</p>
<p>We’ve previously talked about the fact that I could just open my Chrome console and type <code>$.cookie('loggedin', 'yes', { expires: 1 });</code> in order to stay authenticated for one day without even the need for an account.<br>
</p>
<p>So, how the heck does this web page know who I am?<br>
Maybe it’s just showing some private content under username/password authentication, so it’s not showing any personal data. No one will ever know.</p>
<h2 id="code-formatting">
Code Formatting
</h2>
<p>Probably the less critical part of the whole code, but we can clearly see that this developer have copied/pasted some code taken from some website.</p>
<p>Here we can see the use of the double quotes for writing strings:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1"></a><span>var</span> username <span>=</span> <span>$</span>(<span>"#username"</span>).<span>val</span>()<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2"><a href="#cb10-2"></a><span>var</span> password <span>=</span> <span>$</span>(<span>"#password"</span>).<span>val</span>()<span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here we can see single quotes:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1"></a><span>$</span>.<span>cookie</span>(<span>'loggedin'</span><span>,</span> <span>'yes'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>expires</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span>)<span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This may not look important, but it’s actually telling us that the developer has probably copied some code from StackOverflow without even rewriting it following a common style guide for the whole codebase.<br>
Of course this is a minor issue, but it show that the developer doesn’t really care about understanding how the code is working, it just want it to work in some way.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I do search things on Google daily, but it is more important to understand (for instance) how to set a cookie, than copy and paste something just to make it work.<br>
What if for some reason the whole process breaks? How do you know which part of your script is not working?</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I’m absolutely sure that the code above is fake.<br>
That’s the first time that I see a synchronous SQL query:</p>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1"><a href="#cb12-1"></a><span>var</span> accounts <span>=</span> <span>apiService</span>.<span>sql</span>(</span>
<span id="cb12-2"><a href="#cb12-2"></a>  <span>"SELECT * FROM users"</span></span>
<span id="cb12-3"><a href="#cb12-3"></a>)<span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Normally, I’d expect something like that:</p>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1"><a href="#cb13-1"></a><span>var</span> accounts <span>=</span> <span>apiService</span>.<span>sql</span>(<span>"SELECT * FROM users"</span><span>,</span> (err<span>,</span> res) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb13-2"><a href="#cb13-2"></a>  <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(err)<span>;</span> <span>// some error</span></span>
<span id="cb13-3"><a href="#cb13-3"></a>  <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(res)<span>;</span> <span>// query result</span></span>
<span id="cb13-4"><a href="#cb13-4"></a><span>}</span>)<span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>or like that:</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1"><a href="#cb14-1"></a><span>var</span> accounts <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>apiService</span>.<span>sql</span>(</span>
<span id="cb14-2"><a href="#cb14-2"></a>  <span>"SELECT * FROM users"</span></span>
<span id="cb14-3"><a href="#cb14-3"></a>)<span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Even if <code>apiService.sql</code> returns a value synchronously (which I doubt), internally it have to open a connection to a database, make a query and send back the response, which (as you may have guessed) can’t be synchronous.<br>
</p>
<p>But even if the code above was not a fake, I’m sure that it has been written by a junior dev.<br>
During my first weeks as a developer, I’m pretty sure I wrote such bad code for my old company (sorry :D).<br>
</p>
<p><strong>It’s not a junior developer fault</strong>.<br>
Let’s pretend that the above code is real. The junior developer here is making its best for making it work.<br>
He/she have yet to learn how to properly handle SQL queries, cookies and other stuff, and that’s totally fine!<br>
</p>
<p>Senior developers should provide some form of mentorship in order to make sure that junior devs can understand their errors, and such bad code won’t go in production.<br>
</p>
<p>I know for sure that there are certain companies that doesn’t really care about the code that they’re shipping.<br>
Does it solve a problem? Deploy it.<br>
Is it written by a junior, without even an approval from a senior dev? Deploy it.<br>
</p>
<p>Shit happens.</p>
<h2 id="update-20200803">UPDATE 2020/08/03</h2>
<p>After discussing this article on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/i1ph52/reviewing_the_worst_piece_of_code_ever">Reddit</a>, a very nice guy reached out sharing the following Reddit thread: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programminghorror/comments/66klvc/this_javascript_code_powers_a_1500_user_intranet">https://www.reddit.com/r/programminghorror/comments/66klvc/this_javascript_code_powers_a_1500_user_intranet</a></p>
<p>“<em>This JavaScript code powers a 1,500 user intranet application</em>”</p>
<p>so apparently I was wrong. This piece of code is not fake!</p>

<p>When I first saw the second chart, I thought it looked remarkably similar to the first. Sure enough, it does. Below are the two charts together. The darker line shows the price according to the left-side axis and the lighter line shows the Google Trends Score according to the right-side axis.</p>

<p>It turns out that bitcoin’s price and its Google Trends Score are quite correlated.</p>



<p>Specifically, they have had a 72% positive correlation since October 2013. This compares favorably to bitcoin’s <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoins-correlation-with-gold-is-weakening-says-new-kraken-report">26% correlation with the stock market and 24% correlation with gold</a> over the last year.</p>



<p>I should note that the correlation between bitcoin’s price and its Google Trends Score was much stronger up until both price and score peaked in December 2017 (98%) than it has been since (59%).</p>



<p>Nonetheless, the purpose of this analysis is not to argue about the level of correlation nor to assert causation one way or another (though it seems logical that the price and popularity feed off of each other). Rather, the purpose of this analysis is to make a speculative projection regarding what bitcoin’s price could be if and when its popularity (as measured by its Google Trends Score) returns to and surpasses its previous all-time high.</p>



<p>In order to make this projection, we first must consider the historical ratio between bitcoin’s average price and its Google Trends Score on a monthly basis. Let us refer to this as the <em><strong>price:score ratio</strong></em><strong> </strong>for short.</p>



<p><strong><span>Bitcoin’s Price:Score Ratio</span></strong></p>



<p>The chart below shows how bitcoin’s price:score ratio has increased over the last several years.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1241" data-permalink="https://blogofjake.com/image-29/" data-orig-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png" data-orig-size="783,307" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-29" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png?w=783" src="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png?w=783" alt="" srcset="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png 783w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png?w=150 150w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png?w=300 300w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px"></figure>



<p>For a ratio that has been relatively volatile historically, it has remained unusually consistent for the last two months (June &amp; July) at 729, just 4% short of its all-time high of 758 in November 2019.</p>



<p>Bitcoin’s price:score ratio has been above 645 for 9 of the last 12 months after having only reached such a level once before, and barely (646 in October 2018).</p>



<p>The 3 months in the last year during which the ratio was lower than 645 can be fairly easily explained. They took place this past March, April, and May as hype grew in anticipation of bitcoin’s once every four years halving event on May 11, 2020. Additionally, people perhaps were searching more than usual for information about alternative assets (including bitcoin) when the stock market crashed ~30% in the early days of the lockdown resulting from the pandemic. Those two factors together seem sufficient to explain the uptick in bitcoin’s Google Trends Score over that period. On the other side of the price:score ratio, bitcoin’s price fell along with the market, and so with the price going down and the score going up, the decreased price:score ratio over those few months makes sense.</p>



<p>Since the stock market substantially recovered and the halving event came and went without materially moving bitcoin’s price, the Google Trends Score has returned to the pre-pandemic, pre-halving-hype range. For the last two months (June &amp; July), bitcoin’s monthly Google Trends Score has stayed steady at 13, which is equal to its average from April 2018 (after the peak) through February 2020 (before the halving hype and market crash).</p>



<p>For some additional context, it should be noted that bitcoin’s Google Trends Score has only been equal to or greater than 21 in 7 months since bitcoin’s inception and they all took place consecutively surrounding bitcoin’s last major surge from September 2017 through March 2018 (with scores chronologically of 21, 22, 44, 100, 55, 39, and 23).</p>



<p><strong><span>Flying Under The Radar</span></strong></p>



<p>Sufficed to say, bitcoin’s average score of 13 since the last surge, excluding the three aforementioned months from earlier this year (14 if we include them), shows objectively that bitcoin is flying under the radar (in terms of its popularity as a search term at least). Of course, it may not seem this way to people who follow crypto closely and daily but the algorithmic and mass-data collecting Google Trends Score should be trusted over any single person’s speculative and subjective observation about the current level of hype and attention.</p>



<p>If you, like me, believe that bitcoin is and has been flying under the radar for more than two years now, the natural question to ask is this. What do we expect to happen when that is no longer the case? In other words, what happens to bitcoin’s price if and when it reaches the pinnacle of its next hype cycle? How high might bitcoin fly the next time we see a situation similar to that of December 2017?</p>



<p><strong><span>Projecting Bitcoin’s Price</span></strong></p>



<p>I believe a reasonable response to this question can be made by applying bitcoin’s average price:score ratio over the last twelve months (643) to a Google Trends Score of 100 to estimate what bitcoin’s price would be if the price:score ratio stays about constant and bitcoin’s popularity in terms of search returns to its all-time high. The price implied by this projection is about $65,000 as is demonstrated by the maximum value in the top right corner of the chart below. Basically, if one believes that bitcoin will at least at some point return to the level of popularity it attained in December 2017, this methodology would lead that person to expect bitcoin to attain a price of at least $60,000 at that time.</p>

<p>This estimate can be made less conservative in two ways. The first is to assume that the price:score ratio will continue to increase as it has all along (6% month-over-month), rather than calculating the price using the LTM average of the ratio. The second is to assume that bitcoin’s popularity as a search term will well surpass its previous all-time high set in December 2017 just as that all-time was more than twice as great as any high before it and more than 8 times greater than the all-time high before May 2017 (which was set in December 2013, perhaps not coincidentally exactly 4 years or one halving period prior to the latest all-time high). I hesitate to call either of these two less conservative assumptions aggressive because they are not only reasonable but actually probable if one is to simply assume that the historical trends will continue in terms of the score and the ratio.</p>



<p>As such, I will close by presenting a chart which one can use to approximate the price implied by their own inputs for the Google Trends Score and the price:score ratio. In this chart, I show the ratio for the last 12 months, 2 years, 3 years, and so on, and use the average year-over-year growth rate between those figures (16%) to project the next twelve months (“NTM”), next two years (“N2Y”), and next three years (“N3Y”) ratios.</p>



<p>The highest price projected on the chart is right around $300,000 based on a Google Trends Score of 3 times the previous all-time high (300) and a projected N3Y price:score ratio of 996 (the LTM average of 643 increased 16% 3 times for 3 years). Of course, this maximum price projection is limited only arbitrarily by the maximums I have decided to present on this chart for both the score and the ratio.</p>

<p><strong><span>To Be Continued…</span></strong></p>



<p>Many people have employed many methodologies in attempting to accurately project bitcoin’s price. For example, <a href="https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD">PlanB</a>‘s stock to flow ratio looks at scarcity to make one of the more convincing price projections I’ve seen. My price:score ratio looks at popularity in endeavoring to do the same. This analysis was not intended to be totally comprehensive. My intention was merely to introduce this methodology for others to critique. As such, my hope is that this becomes widely enough read so that I may receive ample critical feedback for further consideration and refinement of the methodology.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Every day, we carry burdens of family, job, and community. We manage the load by breaking them into pieces and put them into a to-do list. The agony of life is that the more tasks we tick off the list, the more added. Running faster seems to be the only way out, so we run faster aided by tools, only to discover at the end of a period that we have been running on a treadmill with ever-increasing speed, going nowhere.</p><p>I have run on the treadmill of tasks with panting of disappointment for more weeks than I can count. For reasons I can't explain, enlightenment in life strikes only at the trough of despair. I was reminded of a story in the great Indian epic, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a>, during one of the downcast days. The story goes like this.</p><p><em>I'm paraphrasing the story here, so if you know the story, allow me some latitude.</em></p><blockquote><p>One day, Drona, the teacher, lines up his students to teach archery. He commands them to focus on a bird on a near-by tree. Every student raised their bow and was ready to shoot. <br>
Before they shoot, he walks over to each student and asks them what they see. <br>
“I see the tree, the branch, and the bird” answers the first student. Drona asks him to put the bow down and stand aside. He moves to the next student. <br>
“Tree, branch, and the bird …” The second student repeats the same answer. And the next, and the next. Finally, Drona approaches Arjuna. “What do you see, my favorite boy?” <br>
“The tip of the arrow and the eye of the bird,” Arjuna replied. <br>
“Do you see the tree and the leaves?” Asked Drona. <br>
“No, just the tip of the arrow and the eye of the bird.” <br>
“Shoot,” commands Drona. <br>
Arjuna releases the arrow and hits the target.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Moral of the story: When you want to achieve something, your attention should be on what you have and what you target. Everything else is noise, and you should shut them out.</p></blockquote><p>I'm no archer, but I can transfer the fundamentals to any domain of interest. I started building a system that embodies the principles of the above story. I have used and fine-tuned the system for long, so I feel sure to share it with you. Here are the fundamental principles behind this system:</p><ul><li>Know the outcomes that you want to achieve</li><li>See the outcomes often</li><li>Create projects to reach the outcomes</li><li>Divide each project into weekly wins</li><li>Win a day</li><li>Review to learn, pat, and adjust</li><li>Iterate this cycle to win the outcomes</li></ul><h2 id="know-the-outcomes">Know the outcomes</h2><blockquote><p>It's hard to do a really good job on anything you don't think about in the shower - Paul Graham, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/top.html">The top idea in your mind</a></p></blockquote><p><img src="https://cdn.olai.in/jjude/wins-plan.png" alt=""></p><p>We don't stop thinking about our personal life when we enter the office, and we don't stop thinking of our job when we play with our kids. Thus it is futile to try for a balance; rather, we should integrate all areas of our lives to have a fulfilling life.</p><p>After many iterations, I have found <strong>four areas that encompass all of life</strong>, and if I do well in those areas, I would have a fulfilling life. They are <strong>w</strong>ealth, <strong>i</strong>nsights, <strong>n</strong>etwork, and <strong>s</strong>elf-control.</p><p>For each area, I think of one or two outcomes I want to achieve in three years. The outcomes I want to accomplish in each area in the coming three years looks like this:</p><p><strong>Wealth</strong></p><ul><li>Launch Gravitas WINS course</li></ul><p><strong>Insights</strong></p><ul><li>Learn to run a digital business (Gravitas WINS course)</li></ul><p><strong>Network</strong></p><ul><li>Five mentors &amp; Five Thousand Students</li></ul><p><strong>Self-control</strong></p><ul><li>Stay fit and healthy</li></ul><p>All the projects are related, hence it is easier to remember and think about them cohesively. Because they are cohesive, ideas pop into my head during showers or when I take a walk.</p><p>Once I know the outcomes, I divide them further into quarterly projects and weekly milestones. At any quarter, I run only one or two projects. In this quarter, JAS 2020, I am focusing only on two projects:</p><ul><li>Completing the material for the Gravitas WINS course</li><li>Double the subscribers for this newsletter</li></ul><h2 id="win-the-day">Win the day</h2><blockquote><p>Slow is smooth, smooth is fast - Navy SEALs</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://cdn.olai.in/jjude/daily-wins.png" alt=""></p><p>WINS sheet is not a glorified to-do list; it is not even a to-do list by another name. It is a WINS sheet. I enter only those activities that will move me towards the outcome.</p><p>There are always other tasks that I need to do. I do one of the three with those tasks:</p><ul><li>avoid them</li><li>delegate them</li><li>do a good enough job to move on</li></ul><h2 id="reflect-daily--review-weekly">Reflect daily &amp; Review weekly</h2><p>Every day, I reflect on the day that went by.</p><ul><li>Did something catch my attention?</li><li>Did I do something beyond expectation?</li><li>Was I distracted?</li><li>Did I spend too much on movies or YouTube?</li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn.olai.in/jjude/weekly-reflection.png" alt=""></p><p>Every Sunday night, I sit with the sheet and review the previous week.</p><p>There is always a surprise every week. New things pop up; I completed more than I planned; but most weeks, I completed only 80% of what I intended.</p><p>Since the outcome is clear, I am not disappointed even if I have not completed everything I planned. Eighty percent progress every week towards the outcome is a great move forward.</p><p>When I review every week, I get 54 chances to review and amend my ways.</p><h2 id="adjust-as-you-go-along">Adjust as you go along</h2><p>After the Sunday review, I take a print-out for the next week. I write down the three-year outcome and the quarterly projects again. Repeatedly writing the expected results gives me a moment to consider the outcomes and projects in light of what I know.</p><ul><li>Do these outcomes still make sense?</li><li>Are these projects the best way to achieve the outcomes?</li><li>Is there a way to achieve the outcome differently?</li><li>Can I partner with someone to reach the milestone in half the time?</li><li>Can I use any tool to amplify my efforts?</li></ul><p>I go through these questions, and I adjust the outcomes, projects, and weekly wins. Usually, I don't make any changes to outcomes and projects.

<p>A product, an application, a website, the success of all these do depend on the functionalities built into them. But answer to some questions like “How easy they were to use? How easy were they to understand? Did they do the job without any errors?”, ‘quality’ becomes the most important factor of it all.</p>



<p>A developer may build the functionality but a tester determines the quality of the software and how well they were built.</p>



<p>Google defines Quality as “the standard of something as measured against other things of a similar kind; the degree of excellence of something”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thus, quality for obvious reasons is a very important aspect of any product or service. It, clearly, can be highly subjective. To remove the ambiguity around quality, it becomes essential to set up methods and processes to define or verify the quality of a product for the people involved in making the product and for the people who use the product.</p>



<p>When we talk about quality in terms of a software application, we also hear the term ‘Testing’&nbsp; a lot. They seem to be used interchangeably.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it is not just about Testing or just about Quality, is it? There are more terms like Quality Assurance and Quality Control which again are quite often confused with Testing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In reality, these three are supposed to be different yet related to each other and form different parts of the quality management cycle. In this blog, we will take a look at these 3, their importance and how they can be used to make the product better.</p>



<h2><strong>What is Quality Assurance?</strong></h2>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.yourdictionary.com/quality-assurance" target="_blank">Yourdictionary.com</a> defines quality assurance as “A system for evaluating performance, as in the delivery of services or the quality of products provided to consumers, customers, or patients.”</p>



<p>Quality Assurance(QA) is a standard process set up by an organization to meet quality standards. This process helps to avoid mistakes and defects in the end delivered product and services to customers. </p>



<p>QA is the foundation pillar for quality management as it focuses on the integrity of the product. It also provides confidence to stakeholders that desired and mentioned requirements are fulfilled.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>What is Quality Control?</strong></h2>



<p>Quality Control is defined as “the process of setting standards and testing to make sure something, like a product or service, is done correctly.”</p>



<p>The goal of quality control is to check whether the prescribed model was followed or not. It can be achieved by performing audits and determining whether the team followed the defined model to attain quality.</p>



<h2><strong>Origin</strong></h2>



<p>Both Quality Assurance and Quality control are interrelated. They are essential parts of quality management protocols followed by an organization. Initially, Quality control started to be followed in the 1920s by the manufacturing industry. </p>



<p>The Quality control guidelines need to be put in place as the manufacturing industry demands the same replicas of the original product in bulk without any variations. The Quality control process helps them check if the desired requirements were met without committing any mistakes.</p>



<p>With passing years, more research work and Growing technology made the manufacturing process more complex.&nbsp; This made the Quality control process even more complex. </p>



<p>This made the organization define a proper quality control process and ensure it is being followed throughout the development of that particular unit.</p>



<p>In the 1950’s, The process of&nbsp; Quality Control was further extended in the manufacturing unit by performing&nbsp; Quality Assurance checks and Audits. The major areas of focus were the sectors related to public health and safety.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The idea behind “Assurance” was to randomly select any manufactured piece from the batch and check if it meets the desired requirement. If the piece is found to meet the requirement it is passed. </p>



<p>If the piece did not match the exact requirement but was within defined range it may be passed. If it is found out of defined range, it has to be rejected and can lead to immediate stopping of the manufacturing process and starting it all over again from scratch leading to loss of money and time.</p>



<p>Quality control focuses on auditing the project and checking if defined guidelines and protocols were followed while manufacturing or not.</p>



<h2><strong>Quality Control: What role quality audits and inspection play in product development?</strong></h2>



<p>Quality Audits are the onsite evaluation of a process to ensure their compliance with the requirements. They are performed under the supervision of an auditor who checks whether set guidelines were practised during the making of the product.</p>



<p> Audits are not about checking the product quality but to inspect the type of work done in making a product. It evaluates how closely the prescribed model was followed. Are there any variations? If yes, then the reason behind variations?</p>



<p>The objective of audits is to continuously improve the quality of the work henceforth increasing product quality. Inspection can be one of the aspects of Audit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The inspection examines the traits of a product. It checks how well the product fits requirements, are there any variation between developed product and desired product. If yes, it will fit the requirement or not. How many load/stress products can handle? Which adverse situation can make it crash?</p>



<p>In short, the audit is all about examining the quality of the process used while making a product. Inspection is about examining how well the product fits the requirement provided by stakeholders.</p>



<p>Quality and inspection are being practised in a wide variety of industries such as software, manufacturing, automobile, retail, etc. to ensure a standard procedure and practice is being followed by all. </p>



<p>As in bulk manufacturing, any deviation from the standard procedure might lead to mistakes which can result in loss of a huge amount of money and time.</p>



<h2><strong>What is Testing?</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://testsigma.com/automated-testing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing</a> is the process to check if the designed product behaves as required when subjected to various conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The requirements are documented in the form of test cases. The tester verifies and validates the product. If the product requirement under test behaves as expected, the test case is marked as pass or else fail. </p>



<p>The defect is raised by the tester for the failed scenarios and assigned to the developer. Once the defect is fixed by the developer again the requirement is tested to verify the fix and the corresponding case is passed. It is important to have these feedback loops at every stage of the product delivery lifecycle.</p>



<p>By documenting requirements and corresponding testing results, we get a clear picture of how testing is progressing, what procedures are being followed, what is pending, what is the current success rate. Some of the pointers which are&nbsp; defined by testing are:</p>



<p>1. Code and function coverage</p><p>2. The traceability matrix helps define each requirement and has at least one case mapped to it.&nbsp;</p><p>3. percentage of automation vs. manual testing&nbsp;</p><p>4. number of test case executed</p><p>5. Total number of cases passed</p><p>6. Total number of cases failed</p><p>7. The number of defects raised and fixed.</p>



<p>The testing process cannot be subjected to one model as they are various kinds of tests that a product undergoes. Each type of testing has different goals to fulfil. For example, <a href="https://testsigma.com/regression-testing/functional-regression-testing" target="_blank">Functional testing</a> will only check for the conformance to requirement. </p>



<p>Whereas, non-functional testing will check other aspects of requirements such as how an application would behave when subjected to heavy load. </p>



<p>Hence, it is almost impossible to follow one model throughout testing and achieve the desired result. If you try following one model throughout testing scope they are high chances of missing on some essential requirements.</p>



<h2><strong>How testing can help make your product better?</strong></h2>



<p>Testing is documenting each requirement in the form of scenarios and verifying it. Good testing requires a lot of thoughtful work and experience. </p>



<p>Experience makes you understand the requirement better and helps design crisp and clear test cases without missing on any requirement. A good test case should include both positive and negative scenarios.</p>



<p>Each documented requirement is tested. The first step to good testing activity is proper communication. Communication should not be limited to documents being mailed back and forth. </p>



<p>It should involve an open conversation. Each member of the team can speak to anybody and clear their doubts. This helps ensure all team members are on the same page.</p>



<p>Healthy team environment also assures good testing.&nbsp; If coordination is lagging between teammates the problem needs to be addressed and fixed. </p>



<p>Good testing checks what impact any newly introduced or suggested way of working can bring to the existing system and how it can help the team and users in a better way.</p>



<p>Good testing challenges assurance. It checks for all possibilities and their outcomes. The testing activity should be incorporated from the requirement phase as it helps provide better feasibility of requirements, what assumptions to be made, how products can be tested effectively, what cannot be tested, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Good testing provides an excellent end product that in turn yields high customer satisfaction. Thus, fulfilling the goal of Quality management system. </p>



<p>Hence, to deliver an apt end product testing plays a key role in the development of the product. Without testing, it would be difficult to say that a developed product is bug-free and right.</p>



<p>Early testing, often testing and performing as much as possible is the only key for a high customer satisfaction rate and application to be a success. Continuously working on customer feedback, testing and delivering the product as per their need is the only way to thrive in a competitive market.</p>



<h2><strong>Finally, what is the relationship between QA, QC and Testing</strong>?</h2>



<p>To sum up, Quality assurance makes sure that correct processes are set up to get a quality product as a result. This also …</p></div></div>

                    <p><strong><em>We can take advantage of the way humans think about value.</em></strong></p><p>We know that the computer you are using is <strong>worth more</strong> than the water bottle that is on the table. That is just something we inherently know. <strong>Why?</strong> Because we probably purchased water in the past, we recognize the price of a computer. We understand that we get more value out of the computer than the bottle of water. Every human has a built-in value meter in which we value products (or services!) comparatively.</p><p>Now, assume I put you in the middle of the desert and don't give you water for two days. Suddenly the value of the water bottle climbs to the top of your value meter.</p><hr><p>When you ask a person directly what they are willing to pay for a bottle of water, they refer to their value meter. They give you an answer based on expectation and comparison rather than on how much they may potentially value it. This happening makes it hard for a person to admit the real value of your product.</p><p>This phenomenon occurs when your product is an innovation, without valid comparisons, or if the value your product provides is much higher than any substitutes available on the market. The customer suddenly does not have an accurate thermometer to measure your product against, and will often give you a much lower price point when asked directly.</p><p>Economists and psychologists have studied this phenomenon for a long time. There are many techniques to gather information on the world-famous question for any startup: <strong>How much should I price my product?</strong></p><p>We can take advantage of this phenomenon by asking the customer indirect questions on a range.</p><hr><p>One of my favorite techniques, which I believe works very well, is the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Westendorp%27s_Price_Sensitivity_Meter">Van Westerndorp method</a></strong>, also known as the Price Sensitivity Meter technique. Its a series of 4 simple questions you can ask your customers to determine a price range at which your product pricing matches your offering's real value. </p><p>What better way then to put those questions on a survey and ask enough people. If you survey, say, 150 potential customers, you will discover a pretty accurate price range determined by consumer value. Simple enough? Let's get started.</p><p>The first step is to <strong>make sure that customers understand your product</strong>. Consider giving customers a demo, sharing a video, or showing them detailed pictures of your product. You could include this at the top of your survey. For our purposes, let us take a picture of this yummy Gyro. Since a picture is worth a thousand words, I think it would do quite well to price this Gyro.</p><figure><img src="https://theunconventional.blog/content/images/2020/07/gyro.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://theunconventional.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/gyro.jpg 600w, https://theunconventional.blog/content/images/2020/07/gyro.jpg 700w"><figcaption>Let's price this Gyro.</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<ol>
<li>The first question you would ask is, at what particular price point is this Gyro way <strong>too expensive</strong> that you would never consider purchasing it?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Then you would ask at what specific price point is this Gyro <strong>getting expensive, but you would still consider</strong> buying it?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>At what price point is this Gyro a really <strong>good deal</strong>?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>And, At what point is this Gyro <strong>too cheap</strong> that you'd question its quality?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Notice the answers would give us a range of prices rather than one fixed price. By answering in ranges, people tend to let go of their value spectrum and instead determine the boundaries of how valuable the product is to them. This technique is, by far, one of the most accurate ways of determining your products true value-based price through a survey.</p><p>Looking at the data for 30+ users, we would get a cumulative graph as shown below.</p><figure><img src="https://theunconventional.blog/content/images/2020/07/PSM-graph-ready.png" alt="" srcset="https://theunconventional.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/PSM-graph-ready.png 600w, https://theunconventional.blog/content/images/2020/07/PSM-graph-ready.png 933w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Gyro Survey Results</figcaption></figure><p>From the results of the survey above, (about 30 entries at the time of this article.) We notice that the optimal value-based price range is between $2.5 and $3.5. At $2.5, the Gyro has approximately 15% of people who think its both expensive and too cheap. The optimal price would be the intersection of "too expensive" and "too cheap" at $3. Of course, this is just an indication of pricing and based purely on the people you have surveyed!</p><p>For anyone interested, I have created the Gyro survey <a href="https://forms.gle/EML2DwbiaEgFQWoe8">here</a> &nbsp;(feel free to take it!). I have set up a live updating-pricing <a href="https://bit.ly/2X0wQoZ">worksheet</a> to go along with it.</p><p><strong>Feel free to make a copy for your own product pricing journey, and good luck with your product pricing adventures.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					
<p>The GIMP team recently informed me that the next upcoming version of GIMP will be GIMP 2.10.22 (no GIMP 3.0 just yet – womp). Though there has been no official announcements of specific features to come in this next version, there has been one feature announcement in particular that has caught my eye – the “<strong>linked layers</strong>” feature.</p>



<h2>Linked Layers – GIMP’s Answer to Photoshop’s Smart Objects?</h2>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/zemarmot/status/1286952087558004738?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GIMP quietly announced (via a retweet)</a> that the <a href="https://patreon.com/zemarmot?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=creatorshare" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ZeMarmot team</a> was working on a new feature they are calling the “Linked Layers” feature (note: this has nothing to do with the “transform link” feature already found in GIMP).</p>



<p>In fact, work for this feature actually began in July 2019 (about a year ago) but, due to limited developers working on GIMP, this feature was shelved until recently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jehan from ZeMarmot, who recently revisited development on this feature, described the application of Linked Layers in this way: “What if you wanted to use the same background in several images? Instead of duplicating it, you could just link it from all images using it. And if you edit a bit your common background, it would automatically update the render of all images.”</p>



<p>Sound familiar?&nbsp;</p>



<p>To me, this sounds like GIMP’s version of “Smart Objects” – the popular Photoshop feature that allows you to “link” a different file to your composition, then have that file live update in your current composition any time you make changes to it. This has many applications – especially in the world of creating universal templates that can be updated with your own design (by simply replacing the “linked image” with your own design, then re-saving that image). <strong>This is huge.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>It would work like this in GIMP: you would create a new layer, and under “Fill With” you choose “Image Link” (red arrow in the image above). Choosing this option would bring up an option to select an image to link the layer to on your computer (blue arrow). You then select your image, and click “OK” to create your new layer. The layer is now linked to the image on your computer. If you were to then open that image in GIMP and make edits to it, the edits would automatically update in the linked layer inside your other composition.</p>



<h2>Why GIMP’s Linked Layers Will Be Just As Good As Photoshop’s Smart Objects</h2>

<p>Some of you are wondering how this feature would keep pace with Photoshop’s well-established “Smart Objects” feature. In Photoshop, not only can you link a layer from one composition to a layer or image from another composition, but you can also link vector objects from Adobe Illustrator as a layer in Photoshop, and edit that vector object essentially in real-time in either program and have the quality of the vector object remain intact.</p>



<p>Well, GIMP’s “linked layers” will do the exact same thing – using Open Source alternatives, of course. This feature will be integrated with Inkscape so that, for example, you can link a vector composition to a GIMP layer, and have the GIMP layer scale up without quality loss the way any vector object would in Inskcape. <strong>This is mind-blowing.</strong> You could also make updates to the vector file in Inkscape, and those changes would then refresh inside of the linked layer in GIMP. It would essentially create a dynamic link between the two programs.</p>



<p>Here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/N5oyqbD7zyQ">video ZeMarmot released showing this new “linked layers” feature in action.</a> This isn’t just a pipe-dream or concept yet to be implemented – it’s a feature they’ve demonstrated to work in a test-version of GIMP. </p>



<p>If GIMP can successfully get linked layers to work in a stable release version of GIMP, the internet, myself included, will lose its mind. And, once again, GIMP will have successfully taken a bite out of Adobe’s photo editing software lead (still without charging its users a dime).</p>



<p>In my opinion, some form of “smart object” functionality is one of the top 3 features missing in GIMP (and one of the top 3 things I get comments about on my videos – especially when doing PS vs. GIMP comparisons). Stay tuned – I will provide more information on this feature as it comes out (hopefully via a video tutorial if they get the feature implemented in one of the new release-versions of GIMP).</p>



<p>If you want to help speed up the development of this and other cool new features in GIMP, I recommend supporting the <a href="https://patreon.com/zemarmot?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=creatorshare">ZeMarmot team on Patreon</a> so they can spend more time on GIMP development and less time on other jobs to pay their bills.</p>

<p>English to SQL translation is getting better!  Can you guess which of
these queries to find the actor appearing in the most movies (in a fictional dataset)
was written by a human, and which by machine?</p>

<p><img src="https://paulfitz.github.io/images/db/most_films.png" alt="a human query, or is it"></p>

<p><img src="https://paulfitz.github.io/images/db/machine.png" alt="a machine query, or is it"></p>

<p>Well ok yes you probably can, but the point is they are both pretty good!</p>

<p>In early 2019, when I
was looking for published models for text to SQL translation, I had the most joy with one
called <a href="https://github.com/naver/sqlova/">SQLova</a> (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20101381">Hacker News discussion from that time</a>).
SQLova was trained on the <a href="https://github.com/salesforce/WikiSQL">WikiSQL</a> dataset, a collection of natural
language questions and SQL queries for tables drawn from Wikipedia.
Part of what made SQLova work well was using BERT to transform its input.
<a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/">BERT</a> is a model released in 2018 for generic NLP tasks, trained on
BooksCorpus and English Wikipedia, that led to a wave of
state-of-the-art improvements in all sorts of language problems as
people bolted it on to their models.  That wave continues to this day,
and BERT’s descendants get better and better.</p>

<p>SQLova was limited to queries on a single table, 
which is not the most interesting use to make of relational databases.
In 2018 the <a href="https://yale-lily.github.io/spider">Spider dataset</a> had been released, with questions and queries
involving multiple tables, so I was looking forward to models showing up
trained on that.  <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/IRNet">IRNet</a> come out with a pretrained model in late 2019, and I started
playing with it.  It was great to see joins and more complex clauses
coming into play.  But a downside of work benchmarked on the Spider dataset
was that the benchmark didn’t include what is called “value” prediction
(such as figuring out parameters in a query), and research code developed with
Spider in mind often skipped that.  This makes sense from a research perspective,
but generates incomplete queries.</p>

<p>I noticed a network called <a href="https://github.com/brunnurs/valuenet">ValueNet</a> released recently.
Building on IRNet, it adds on some machinery for guessing values, and generally makes more of an
effort to produce fully executable queries.  I appreciate that.  Let’s try it out!</p>

<p>As a concrete example, let’s use the Sakila database,
as introduced on the <a href="https://www.jooq.org/sakila">jook website</a>.
This is a (fictional) database about movie rentals from physical stores back
when that was a thing.  It has 16 tables, with a rich relational
structure:</p>

<p><img src="https://paulfitz.github.io/images/db/sakila.png" alt="a database schema"></p>

<p>On the <a href="https://www.jooq.org/sakila">jook website</a>, they give an
example of a (human-written) query that “finds the actor with most films”:</p>

<p><img src="https://paulfitz.github.io/images/db/most_films.png" alt="human query for acting-est actor"></p>

<p>Let’s see what ValueNet can do:</p>

<p><img src="https://paulfitz.github.io/images/db/made_most_movies_id.png" alt="machine query for acting-est actor"></p>

<p>(I wrote movies rather than films because I’ve lived in the United
States too long, but it works either way).
The SQL looks plausible!  It picked the right tables, relations,
and aggregations. But the answer is just an ID.  Let’s be
more explicit that we want a name:</p>

<p><img src="https://paulfitz.github.io/images/db/made_most_movies_first_name.png" alt="give me a name"></p>

<p>Gina!  Looks like the result matches what the human got.  ValueNet gave
us a name, but in a begrudging way, just the first name.  Let’s get
more specific again and ask for a full name:</p>

<p><img src="https://paulfitz.github.io/images/db/made_most_movies_full_name.png" alt="a full name"></p>

<p>Neat, it gave us all the name parts in the table.  It didn’t know
how to construct a full name but <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/">who does really</a>.
To match the human query, let’s also ask how many films this Gina
person acted in:</p>

<p><img src="https://paulfitz.github.io/images/db/made_most_movies_full_name_and_count.png" alt="how many movies"></p>

<p>That was a pleasant experience.  There was no cherry-picking here, I downloaded
the database and tried it on ValueNet and this is what I got.  It’d be nice if
the network could better guess what full set of information is useful to give, but it was
definitely helpful.  Also, compared to single-table operation in Sqlova, I am
excited to see the network picking good tables to look at from the soup available,
and relating them appropriately.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.jooq.org/sakila">jook website</a> goes on to give another
example (human-written) query to “calculate the cumulative revenue of all stores”:</p>

<p><img src="https://paulfitz.github.io/images/db/cumulative_revenue_real.png" alt="human query for revenue"></p>

<p>That’s a mouthful.  Let’s see what ValueNet does:</p>

<p><img src="https://paulfitz.github.io/images/db/cumulative_revenue.png" alt="machine query for revenue"></p>

<p>That’s not bad!  It figured out the relevant tables and columns.
I couldn’t nudge ValueNet to break this down by day though.
Understandable, since there is nothing structured around days
in the database.  I’d expect the next generation of models
to be able to get that kind of thing though, given that
GPT-3 could no doubt write a detailed essay about it.</p>

<p>As a consolation prize, I asked for a break-down by movie, which I got
without fuss:</p>

<p><img src="https://paulfitz.github.io/images/db/revenue_per_movie.png" alt="revenue per movie"></p>

<p>Neat!  And the great thing is, you don’t need to take my word about
any of this, this is not some <a href="https://twitter.com/FaraazNishtar/status/1285934622891667457">massive network behind an invite-only
API</a> like some networks I could mention 😉.  Just go to
<a href="https://github.com/brunnurs/valuenet">https://github.com/brunnurs/valuenet</a>
and follow their instructions.</p>

<p>My experience with research code in this area is that it is often
difficult to run on data outside of the dataset it is benchmarked on,
since the pipeline for pre-processing that data can be hard to nail
down.  I’ve made a docker image specifically for running ValueNet on
fresh data, and without a GPU (since you don’t need it for inference
really).  Also, to make the whole thing self-contained, I ripped out a
use of Google’s Named Entity Recognition API and replaced it with
something from spacy.  If you have docker, and it is configured so it
can use lots of RAM (3GB or so?), then you can do:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>$ </span>wget https://paulfitz.github.io/files/sakila.db
<span>$ </span>docker run <span>--name</span> valuenet <span>-d</span> <span>-p</span> 5050:5050 paulfitz/valuenet
<span># wait a while</span>
<span>$ </span>curl <span>-F</span> <span>"sqlite=@sakila.db"</span> <span>-F</span> <span>"q=what is the title of the longest film"</span> http://localhost:5050
<span># {"result":{"answer":[["CHICAGO NORTH"]],"sql":"SELECT T1.title FROM film AS T1    ORDER BY T1.length DESC LIMIT 1"},"split":"case_1db37f79-bbfe-4d70-a367-13e785f5e180"}</span>
<span>$ </span>curl <span>-F</span> <span>"sqlite=@sakila.db"</span> <span>-F</span> <span>"q=what is the full name of the actress whose last name is 'WITHERSPOON'"</span> http://localhost:5050
<span># {"result":{"answer":[["ANGELA","WITHERSPOON"]],"sql":"SELECT T1.first_name, T1.last_name FROM actor AS T1 WHERE T1.last_name = 'WITHERSPOON'"},"split":"case_2cbddbed-2704-4037-8a4a-82e9a8a0f3a2"}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>There’s more information at <a href="https://github.com/paulfitz/mlsql#valuenet">https://github.com/paulfitz/mlsql</a>.</p>

<p>How we query databases is ripe for a transformation.  Companies have
been developing and releasing natural language interfaces for decades.
But outside of niche uses they’ve so far been more trouble than they
are worth - brittle, inflexible, lacking common sense.
But the field of natural language processing has evolved a lot, to the
point where we now have access to representations that are far more
robust, flexible, and - if not exactly having common sense - encode a
lot of knowledge about relationships between currencies, names,
chronology, phone numbers, movies, discounts, street names, airports,
email addresses, menus, pokemon, and so on.
I’m looking forward to database query engines that know know more of that!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>In this article, I’ll share my motivation for doing 60+ technical interviews in 30 days. More importantly, I’ll share 13 lessons I learned from my failures and my successes.</p>
<p>I’ve grouped the lessons into three categories to match the phases of a typical recruitment process.</p>
<p>While most of the lessons apply directly to software engineers and technical professionals, the principles behind these lessons can be applied to all careers. I hope you find something useful that you can apply to your professional lives.</p>
<h2 id="how-did-i-get-started-">How did I get started?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p> “If you’re going to fail, do it fast.” — Unknown</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like any other software engineer, I’ve had different types of technical interviews - from the dreaded whiteboard coding interview to the unreal 45-minute coding challenge on platforms like HackerRank. While some of my experiences in these interviews were great, others were bad. Really bad.</p>
<p>But I wanted to get really good at interviewing. I wanted to learn to overcome the interviewing phobia and exude confidence at interviews. Like a skilled surfer, I wanted to learn to ride the high pressure waves that came with interviews. I was also looking to change jobs at the time.</p>
<p>So from January through early March 2020, I applied to and was contacted by companies based in the US and Europe. From early-stage startups like Coda to later stage startups like Crunchbase, from mid-size companies like Affirm, to bigger companies like Amazon and even remote companies like Webflow.</p>
<p>109+ applications later, I landed myself more than 60 interviews. These comprised more than 60 introductory phone interviews, 50+ technical phone screen interviews, 18 take-home coding projects, 11 coding challenges and 8 on-site interviews including 3 virtual ones.</p>
<h2 id="what-did-i-learn-">What did I learn?</h2>
<p>For better appreciation, I have grouped the lessons into three categories to match the different phases of a typical recruitment process.</p>
<h3 id="pre-interview-phase">Pre-Interview Phase</h3>
<p>This covers everything from the initial contact with a company to the point where the first interview happens.</p>
<h4 id="1-what-i-learned-about-applications">1. What I learned about applications</h4>
<p>When I started applying to companies, I imagined that the more applications I submitted, the higher my chances of getting an interview would be. Seems logical, huh? So I set a target of 5 applications a day, aiming for 1 interview for every 5 applications.</p>
<p>But my strategy didn’t work as I hoped it would. The number of interview requests I got often fell short of my target. It was almost a 1:12 ratio - 1 interview for every 12 applications.</p>
<p>I was faced with the question: do I need to increase my daily target to, say, 10 companies? Or was there something else I needed to change?</p>
<p>With every unsuccessful application, I saw that something needed to change.</p>
<p>That change came when I took a break from meeting my daily numbers and began to think of my applications differently. I began to see each application as a sales pitch to the hiring manager or whoever was going to be reading my application, but here the product being sold was me.</p>
<p>If a company needed to fill a talent gap and I say I had the skills, I needed to find a way to convince them that I did.</p>
<p>My new task then became to find a way to effectively pitch my unique skills, experience and personality in a way that convinced the hiring manager that I was the right fit for the job.</p>
<p>Here is an example of one of such <em>pitches</em> I came up with:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596030331456/A8nDIn-ih.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="body image.png"></p>
<p>Backed with my resume, this cover letter had a 95% success rate. The one time this didn’t work, the hiring manager still replied to let me know that the position was no longer available but he would like to connect in the future.</p>
<p>The lesson here is, be very intentional about the application you put forward – quality over quantity. Better still do both. Know your unique competencies and experience and present them in a way that matches the company’s needs without sacrificing your personality.</p>
<p>It is also important to understand the peculiarity of the company you are applying to and its specific needs. A startup or a smaller-sized company may have different needs from a bigger company, thus requiring a different skill-set.</p>
<p>Sell yourself and be sure to back your sales pitch during the interview.</p>
<h4 id="2-what-i-learned-about-recruiter-in-mails">2. What I learned about recruiter in-mails</h4>
<p>During this period, I received a number of in-mails from recruiters (mostly unsolicited) for open roles, the majority of which were roles I wasn’t interested in.</p>
<p>Granted, it was sometimes a lot given my busy schedule but I learned to be empathetic, understanding that these recruiters were only trying to do their jobs.</p>
<p>I stopped seeing these in-mails as noise in my inbox and started making the effort to reply to all recruiter in-mails, even for positions I was not interested in. By doing this, I succeeded in building a network of recruiters that have become a rich resource if I have to switch roles in the future.</p>
<p>Now I don’t expect you may want to start replying to every in-mail you receive. But it might interest you to know that some of the interview requests I got were from recruiters I had replied to before for roles I wasn’t interested in. It never hurts to reply.</p>
<h3 id="the-interview-phase">The Interview Phase</h3>
<p>This covers everything about the interview itself, cutting across the different interview types.</p>
<h4 id="3-how-to-handle-introductory-phone-calls">3. How to handle introductory phone calls</h4>
<p>Yes I get it, you’re busy and many things are competing for your time. But hey, you are also an excellent professional, and that means you never get on a phone call without knowing at least these two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>the first name of your interviewer, and</li>
<li>at least one tangible thing about the company — what they do, where they are located, any recent news, something, anything!</li>
</ul>
<p>I noticed that for interviews where I put in the effort to make these findings, I always came across as being genuinely interested in the company. That’s something recruiters typically look for in these kinds of interviews.</p>
<h4 id="4-how-to-handle-technical-phone-screens">4. How to handle technical phone screens</h4>
<p>The one thing that can almost single-handedly decide how well you do in a technical phone screen interview is your ability to communicate your thoughts clearly.</p>
<p>You may have heard stuff like this before:
“<em>The interviewers care about your thought process. Yes they can see your code but importantly, they want to know why you are doing what you’re doing</em>.”</p>
<p>The interviewer isn’t there with you and so does not have the luxury of seeing other non-verbal cues like your hand gestures or nuances. All the interviewer has is your voice as a means of understanding your thought process.</p>
<p>Now you know how you should lead this conversation, the next question is how do you become good at this? Because the truth is, while expressing your thoughts may come naturally to some people, it doesn’t to others – including me.</p>
<p>So – Practice! Practice!! Practice!!!</p>
<p>Practice doing a lot of mock interviews. Doing these mock interviews with friends made me better and more confident in explaining my thought process. But more interestingly, it helped me develop a new mindset about interviews.</p>
<p>I began to see interviews as a conversation with a friend or a team member. I visualized the interviewer on the other end as one of my friends (I sometimes gave the interviewer a name in my head). So what would have been a high-pressure interview I now saw as a friendly ‘chat’ about a technical problem.</p>
<p>This new mindset, aided by the many practice interviews, helped me grow in confidence so much so that I started enjoying interviews, sorry, technical chats.
How to get started on a problem</p>
<p>Never start solving a problem without fully understanding the problem statement. You are almost never wrong if you start by asking clarifying questions. It’s also a good sign to your interviewer when you ask those questions rather than run with your assumptions.</p>
<h4 id="5-how-to-solve-the-problem">5. How to solve the problem</h4>
<p>Good candidates know how to solve a problem (e.g. a sorting problem), but the best candidates know multiple solutions to a problem and understand the trade-offs of one solution versus the other.</p>
<p>The interviews where I performed the best (Cruise comes to mind) are the ones where I didn’t just solve the algorithmic challenge – I was also able to provide alternative solutions and discuss the trade-offs.</p>
<p>Aim to provide multiple solutions to a problem, be willing to discuss the trade-offs, and be able to implement at least one of them.</p>
<p>For technical interviews, write clean code. Most interviewers care about your code quality as well as the correctness of your solution. Aim for modular code, separate reusable logic into utility functions, name variables and methods properly, and just be a boss!</p>
<h4 id="6-what-to-do-when-you-re-stuck-on-a-problem">6. What to do when you’re stuck on a problem</h4>
<p>There will be times when you’re stuck. And this could be caused by a number of reasons: you don’t have the requisite knowledge, incorrect assumptions, missing details, and so on.</p>
<p>I used to think that at such times I was being judged by how fast I could come up with a solution. So I would be quiet, thinking, not communicating with the interviewer, just thinking.</p>
<p>And this is where a lot of us get it wrong. I get it, you need some alone time to think. But sorry to burst your bubble, that alone time is not when you’re being interviewed by a person.</p>
<p>Yes, your interviewer wants to see that you can come up with a solution, but one thing you must not forget is that they also want to see that <strong>you can collaborate with other team-mates to come up with a solution</strong>. While companies want rock-stars, they also want team-players.</p>
<p>Since your interviewer is a friend, a buddy, a team member who’s on your side and means well for you (Refer to 4), talk to them while you're figuring it out.</p>
<p>Share your thought process up till the point you got stuck and do it confidently, not like some cry for help. By doing so you just may uncover the solution, as was the case during my interview with Coda.</p>
<h4 id="7-how-to-handle-coding-challenges">7. How to handle coding challenges</h4>
<p>The lessons here apply to interviews that take the form of coding challenges on platforms like Hackerrank, Codility, and so on. Typically these are timed challenges, say 45 minutes or …</p></div></div>

<p>Anyone else tired of these annoying popups?</p>

<p><img src="https://lovettchris.github.io/posts/apple_upsell/icloud_installer.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I’m getting pretty tired of all this… I actually tried to find customer support for the PC
installer popup, but no luck. Anyone know who owns this ugly little Windows app? I find it
particularly devious that Apple uses language here that sounds like something is broken until I
“Install” their fix. This is not a fix, this is an upsell to get iCloud on my PC.</p>

<p>The iPhone backup message is also annoying. I tried to tell my iPhone to stop backing up my photos,
and yet I still get this backup failed warning every day. Perhaps Apple should find a more creative
way to upsell my on iCloud because this is driving me nuts, and making it much less likely I’ll
ever checkout the benefits of paying Apple for cloud storage on stuff I’ve backed up my self lots
of other ways.</p>

<p>Apple is world class on user experiences of everything else, so why are they so bad at this
experience? I’m guessing the part of the company that expertly squeezes every dime out of consumers
is not so connected to the user experience gods at Apple… Here’s hoping I can wake up some of
those gods to go slap the accountants on the wrist for this naughty behavior.</p>

<p>-Chris.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content" itemprop="articleBody">
				<p><a href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma</a> "is a microblogging server software that can federate (= exchange messages with) other servers that support the same federation standards (OStatus and ActivityPub). What that means is that you can host a server for yourself or your friends and stay in control of your online identity, but still exchange messages with people on larger servers. Pleroma will federate with all servers that implement either OStatus or ActivityPub, like GNU Social, Friendica, Hubzilla and Mastodon." <a href="https://blog.soykaf.com/post/what-is-pleroma/">(stolen from Lain's blog post)</a>.</p>

<p>Recently I modified my Pleroma instance to support bot services: parse a posted message, take an action, post the result. To get there I had to learn <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a>, the language in which Pleroma is written, as well as <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/overview.html">Phoenix</a>, the web framework Elixir uses, and a little bit about ActivityPub, the protocol for exchanging messages. What I want to explain here in particular is the architecture of Pleroma, so that you can hack it more easily, for fun or if you want to participate in the development.</p>

<h2>Elixir</h2>

<p>As Pleroma is written in <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> you'll need to learn that language to some extent. If you are familiar with Ruby (or Perl, for that matter) and with the idea of functional programming (everything is a function), then it is quite easy to learn and understand. The <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/">documentation</a> and <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html">guides</a> are very good. </p>

<p>If you've never hear of functional programming, the main difference with e.g. Ruby or Java is that Elixir does not use an object-oriented programming model. Instead, there are functions that manipulate data structures and other functions. A particular consequence of the functional model is that there are no for- or while-loops. Instead, there are what is called higher-order functions which e.g. apply another function to a list. Elixir programs also make a lot more use of recursion. </p>

<p>Another point about Elixir as a web programming language is that it is built on a system where processes communicate by passing messages to one another, and it is  built in such a way that if a process dies it will normally be restarted automatically. This approach makes it very easy to offload work to separate worker processes etc. </p>

<p>All this comes courtesy of <a href="https://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a>, the language on which Elixir is built, with its powerfull OTP framework for building applications and its BEAM virtual machine, which manages the processes. </p>

<h2>Phoenix</h2>

<p>A lot of the groundwork of Pleroma is done by <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/overview.html">Phoenix</a>, a very easy-to-use web server framework. Essentially, what happens is that the end user accesses the application using a specific url, typically via a web browser, and based on this url the application performs a number of actions, which in the end result in a change in the state of the application and usually in what is shown in the browser window.</p>

<p>In Phoenix, there are five stages or components  between the connection and the resulting action by the application:</p>

<h3>Endpoint</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Endpoint.html">endpoint</a> is the boundary where all requests to your web application start. It is also the interface your application provides to the underlying web servers.</p>

<p>Pleroma's endpoint is <a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/endpoint.ex"><code>web/endpoint.ex</code></a>. If you look at the source you see several occurrences of <code>plug(Plug...)</code>. <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/plug.html">Plug</a> is a specification for composable modules in between web applications, and it is very heavily used in Pleroma.  For example, to serve only specific static files/folders from <code>priv/static</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>plug</span><span>(</span>
  <span>Plug.Static</span><span>,</span>
  <span>at</span><span>:</span> <span>"/"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>from</span><span>:</span> <span>:pleroma</span><span>,</span>
  <span>only</span><span>:</span> <span>~w(index.html static finmoji emoji packs sounds images instance sw.js)</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Another very nice feature of Phoenis is that you can edit your code while your server is running. It gets automatically recompiled and the affected processes are automatically restarted, courtesy of the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.CodeReloader.html">Phoenix.CodeReloader</a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span>  <span># Code reloading can be explicitly enabled under the</span>
  <span># :code_reloader configuration of your endpoint.</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>code_reloading?</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>plug</span><span>(</span><span>Phoenix.CodeReloader</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Router</h3>

<p><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Router.html">Routers</a> are the main hubs of Phoenix applications. They match HTTP requests to controller actions, wire up real-time channel handlers, and define a series of pipeline transformations for scoping middleware to sets of routes.</p>

<p>Pleroma's router is <a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/router.ex"><code>web/router.ex</code></a>. The key function in the router is the <code>pipeline</code> which lets you create pipelines of plugs. Other functions are <code>scope</code>, <code>get</code>, <code>post</code>, <code>pipe_through</code>, all of these let you match on the url and whether you are dealing with a get or post request, and define appropriate pipelines of actions. For example, federated ActivityPub requests handled as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>scope</span> <span>"/"</span><span>,</span> <span>Pleroma.Web.ActivityPub</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>pipe_through</span><span>(</span><span>:activitypub</span><span>)</span>
  <span>post</span><span>(</span><span>"/users/:nickname/inbox"</span><span>,</span> <span>ActivityPubController</span><span>,</span> <span>:inbox</span><span>)</span>
  <span>post</span><span>(</span><span>"/inbox"</span><span>,</span> <span>ActivityPubController</span><span>,</span> <span>:inbox</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>where the <code>pipe_through(:activitypub)</code> call is used to insert a custom pipeline:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>pipeline</span> <span>:activitypub</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>plug</span><span>(</span><span>:accepts</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>"activity+json"</span><span>])</span>
  <span>plug</span><span>(</span><span>Pleroma.Web.Plugs.HTTPSignaturePlug</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Controllers</h3>

<p><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Controller.htm">Controllers</a> are used to group common functionality in the same (pluggable) module.  </p>

<p>Pleroma makes heavy use of controllers: almost every request is handled by a specific controller for any given protocol, e.g. <code>MastodonAPIController</code> or <code>ActivityPubController</code>. This makes it easy to identify the files to work on if you need to make a change to the code for a given protocol. For example, the ActivityPub post requests in the Router are handled by <code>inbox</code> function in the <a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/activity_pub/activity_pub_controller.ex">ActivityPubController</a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>def</span> <span>inbox</span><span>(%{</span><span>assigns</span><span>:</span> <span>%{</span><span>valid_signature</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>}}</span> <span>=</span> <span>conn</span><span>,</span> <span>params</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Federator</span><span>.</span><span>enqueue</span><span>(</span><span>:incoming_ap_doc</span><span>,</span> <span>params</span><span>)</span>
  <span>json</span><span>(</span><span>conn</span><span>,</span> <span>"ok"</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Views</h3>

<p><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.View.html">Views</a> are used to control the rendering of templates. You create a view module, a template and a set of assigns, which are basically key-value pairs.</p>

<p>Pleroma uses views for "rendering" JSON objects. For example in <a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/activity_pub/activity_pub_controller.ex"><code>web/activity_pub/activity_pub_controller.ex</code></a> there are lines like</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>json</span><span>(</span><span>UserView</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span><span>"user.json"</span><span>,</span> <span>%{</span><span>user</span><span>:</span> <span>user</span><span>}))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, <code>UserView.render</code> is defined in <a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/activity_pub/views/user_view.ex"><code>web/activity_pub/views/user_view.ex</code></a> for a number of different "*.json" strings. These are not really templates, they are simply used to pattern match on the function definitions.</p>

<p>The more conventional usage to create HTML is also used, e.g. the template <a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/templates/mastodon_api/mastodon/index.html.eex"><code>web/templates/mastodon_api/mastodon/index.html.eex</code></a>
is used in <a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/mastodon_api/mastodon_api_controller.ex"><code>web/mastodon_api/mastodon_api_controller.ex</code></a> via the view
<a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/mastodon_api/views/mastodon_view.ex"><code>web/mastodon_api/views/mastodon_view.ex</code></a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>render</span><span>(</span><span>MastodonView</span><span>,</span> <span>"index.html"</span><span>,</span> <span>%{</span><span>initial_state</span><span>:</span> <span>initial_state</span><span>})</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Templates</h3>

<p><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Template.html">Templates</a> are text files (typically html pages) with Elixir code to generate the specific values based on the assigns, included in <code>&lt;%= ... %&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>For example, in Pleroma, the Mastodon front-end uses a template for the <code>index.html</code> file which has the code</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>%</span><span>=</span> <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>get_env</span><span>(</span><span>:pleroma</span><span>,</span> <span>:instance</span><span>)[</span><span>:name</span><span>]</span> <span>%</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>to show the name of the instance.</p>

<h2>Ecto</h2>

<p><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.html">Ecto</a> is not a part of Phoenix, but it is an integral part of most web applications: Ecto is Elixir's main library for working with databases. It provides the tools to interact with databases under a common API.</p>

<p>Ecto is split into 4 main components:</p>

<p>Ecto.Repo - repositories are wrappers around the data store. Via the repository, we can create, update, destroy and query existing entries. A repository needs an adapter and credentials to communicate to the database</p>

<p>Pleroma uses the PostgresQL database.</p>

<p>Ecto.Schema - schemas are used mainly to map tables into Elixir data (there are other use cases too).</p>

<p>Ecto.Changeset - changesets provide a way for developers to filter and cast external parameters, as well as a mechanism to track and validate changes before they are applied to your data</p>

<p>Ecto.Query - written in Elixir syntax, queries are used to retrieve information from the database.</p>

<h2>GenServer</h2>

<p>Because Elixir, like Erlang, uses a processes-with-message-passing paradigm, client-server relationships are so common that they have been abstracted as a <em>behaviour</em>, which in Elixir is a specification for composable modules which have to implement specified public functions (a bit like an interface in Java or typeclass in Haskell).</p>

<p>If we look at the <code>Federator.enqueue</code> function, its implementation actually reduces to a single line:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>GenServer</span><span>.</span><span>cast</span><span>(</span><span>__MODULE__</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>:enqueue</span><span>,</span> <span>type</span><span>,</span> <span>payload</span><span>,</span> <span>priority</span><span>})</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/GenServer.html">GenServer</a> is an Elixir behaviour module for implementing the server of a client-server relation. The <code>cast</code> call sends an asynchronous request to the server (synchronous requests use <code>call</code>). The server behaviour is implemented using the <code>handle_cast</code> callback, which handles <code>cast</code> calls. </p>

<p>In <a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/federator/federator.ex"><code>Pleroma.Federator</code></a>, these are implemented in the same module as the <code>enqueue</code> function, hence the use of <code>__MODULE__</code> rather than the hardcoded module name.</p>

<h2>Applications, Workers and Supervisors</h2>

<p>Elixir borrows the concept of a "supervision tree" from Erlang/OTP. AN application consists of a tree of processes than can either be <em>supervisors</em> or <em>workers</em>. The task of a supervisors is to ensure that the worker processes do their work, including distributing the work and restarting the worker processes when they die. Supervisors can supervise either worker or other supervisors, so you can build a <em>supervision tree</em>.</p>

<p>Elixir provides an <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/elixir/Application.html">Application</a> behaviour module and a <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Supervisor.html">Supervisor</a> module to make this easy. The Application module requires a <code>start()</code> function as entry point. Typical code to create a supervision tree is</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>Supervisor</span><span>.</span><span>start_link</span><span>(</span><span>children</span><span>,</span> <span>opts</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>where <code>start_link()</code> spawns the top process of the tree, and it spawns all the child processes in the list <code>children</code>. </p>

<p>Pleroma uses a convenient but deprecated module called <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Supervisor.Spec.html">Supervisor.Spec</a> which provides <code>worker()</code> and <code>supervisor()</code> functions, for example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>children</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
  <span>supervisor</span><span>(</span><span>Pleroma.Repo</span><span>,</span> <span>[]),</span>
  <span>supervisor</span><span>(</span><span>Pleroma.Web.Endpoint</span><span>,</span> <span>[]),</span>
  <span># ...</span>
  <span>worker</span><span>(</span><span>Pleroma.Web.Federator</span><span>,</span> <span>[]),</span>
  <span># ...</span>
<span>]</span>  
</code></pre></div>
<p>Every worker has this own <code>start_link</code> function,  e.g.  in <a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/federator/federator.ex"><code>web/federator/federator.ex</code></a> we find: </p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>def</span> <span>start_link</span> <span>do</span>
  <span># ...</span>
  <span>GenServer</span><span>.</span><span>start_link</span><span>(</span><span>__MODULE__</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This means that the Federator module borrows the <code>start_link</code> from the GenServer module. This is a very common way to create a worker.</p>

      <a href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty" target="_blank">Alacritty</a>
      is a terminal emulator with a strong focus on simplicity and performance.
      With such a strong focus on performance, included features are carefully
      considered and you can always expect Alacritty to be blazingly fast. By
      making sane choices for defaults, Alacritty requires no additional setup.
      However, it does allow configuration of many aspects of the terminal.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>By coincidence, right when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheChernoProject/videos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Cherno</a> announced his game engine series I was just starting to get going on my own engine. I couldn’t wait to finally have a professional opinion on how to make one. With self-taught programming it’s hard to not doubt yourself constantly, wondering if you are doing things right or just think you are.</p>



<p>Recently, he has been posting videos about huge aspects of his engine like physics and entity systems, which were what I really wanted to learn about by making myself, but he ended up using libraries instead of going through the internals! I am not against using libraries, but to use them for the fun stuff? I felt like it defeated the point of making a <em>custom</em> engine series.</p>



<p>There is an argument to be made about saving time, but this was the first C++ project that I was making and the goal from the start was to go through all the major pillars of an engine: input, graphics, physics, entities, and audio. I wanted to learn how those things worked along with C++ and code design in general.</p>



<p>I bet that some other people are interested in the details of how these systems work, and I want to learn how to explain code better, so I am going to try and make some videos going over the internals of these systems. They end up being much simpler than at first glance.</p>



<p><strong>Let’s start with the physics engine…</strong></p>



<p>Physics engines are responsible for figuring out where each object in a scene is over time. Objects can collide with one another, then choose to respond in several ways. It’s a generic problem that the user can configure at several different levels. Do they want a collider? Do they want to respond to collisions? Do they want to simulate dynamics? They could want dynamics, but not gravity. It’s a problem that calls for good planning and robust design.</p>



<p>I looked at how <a href="https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bullet</a> and <a href="https://github.com/erincatto/box2d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">box2d</a> went about sorting their engines and concluded that the way bullet went about it was solid. I boiled it down to just what was needed, and based my design around that. There are already some <a href="https://www.toptal.com/game/video-game-physics-part-i-an-introduction-to-rigid-body-dynamics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">great articles</a> going over the hard math involved, so I am going to focus on the design aspect instead because I haven’t seen anyone do that, and it’s also a real headache.</p>



<p>At the current moment, this physics engine is not fully featured, but in future articles I plan to build it out further. This article will not cover rotation, multiple contact point collisions, or constrained simulation. I think it will work out for the best as it’s easy to get overwhelmed, and I want to ease into those topics. With that out of the way, let’s dive into the different parts of a physics engine.</p>



<p>The problem can be split into 2 or 3 pieces, dynamics, collision detection, and collision response. I’ll start with dynamics because it is by far the simplest.</p>



<p><strong>Dynamics</strong></p>



<p>Dynamics is all about calculating where the new positions of objects are based on their velocity and acceleration. In high school you learn about the four kinematic equations along with Newton's three laws which describe the motion of objects. We’ll only be using the first and third kinematic equations, the others are more useful for analysis of situations, not simulation. That leaves us with:</p>



<p><span data-katex-display="true">v = v_0+at</span>



<span data-katex-display="true">\Delta x = v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2</span></p><p>We can give ourselves more control by using Newtons 2<sup>nd</sup> law, subbing out acceleration giving us:</p>



<p><span data-katex-display="true">v = v_0+\frac{F}{m}t</span>



<span data-katex-display="true">x = x_0+vt</span></p><p>Each object needs to store these three properties: velocity, mass, and net force. Here we find the first decision we can make towards the design, net force could either be a list or a single vector. In school you make force diagrams and sum up the forces, implying that we should store a list. This would make it so you could set a force, but you would need to remove it later which could get annoying for the user. If we think about it further, net force is really the total force applied in a <em>single</em> frame, so we can use a vector and clear it at the end of each update. This allows the user to apply a force by adding it, but removing it is automatic. This shortens our code and gives a performance bump because there is no summation of forces, it’s a running total.</p>



<p>We’ll use this struct to store the object info for now.</p>



<pre><span>struct</span>&nbsp;<span>Object</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>Position</span><span>;</span>&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;struct&nbsp;with&nbsp;3&nbsp;floats&nbsp;for&nbsp;x,&nbsp;y,&nbsp;z&nbsp;or&nbsp;i&nbsp;+&nbsp;j&nbsp;+&nbsp;k</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>Velocity</span><span>;</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>Force</span><span>;</span>
	<span>float</span>&nbsp;<span>Mass</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</pre>



<p>We need a way to keep track of the objects we want to update. A classic approach is to have a <em>physics world</em> that has list of objects and a <em>step</em> function that loops over each one. Let’s see how that might look; I’ll omit header/cpp files for brevity.</p>



<pre><span>class</span>&nbsp;<span>PhysicsWorld</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>
<span>private</span><span>:</span>
	<span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Object</span><span>*&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span>m_objects</span><span>;</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>m_gravity</span>&nbsp;<span>=</span>&nbsp;<span>vector3</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span>&nbsp;<span>-</span><span>9.81f</span><span>,</span>&nbsp;<span>0</span><span>);</span>
 
<span>public</span><span>:</span>
	<span>void</span>&nbsp;<span>AddObject</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>(</span><span>Object</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>object</span><span>)</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>&nbsp;<span>/*&nbsp;...&nbsp;*/</span>&nbsp;<span>}</span>
	<span>void</span>&nbsp;<span>RemoveObject</span><span>(</span><span>Object</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>object</span><span>)</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>&nbsp;<span>/*&nbsp;...&nbsp;*/</span>&nbsp;<span>}</span>
 
	<span>void</span>&nbsp;<span>Step</span><span>(</span>
		<span>float</span>&nbsp;<span>dt</span><span>)</span>
	<span>{</span>
		<span>for</span>&nbsp;<span>(</span><span>Object</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>obj</span>&nbsp;<span>:</span>&nbsp;<span>m_objects</span><span>)</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>
			<span>obj</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>Force</span>&nbsp;<span>+=</span>&nbsp;<span>obj</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>Mass</span>&nbsp;<span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>m_gravity</span><span>;</span>&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;apply&nbsp;a&nbsp;force</span>
 
			<span>obj</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>Velocity</span>&nbsp;<span>+=</span>&nbsp;<span>obj</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>Force</span>&nbsp;<span>/</span>&nbsp;<span>obj</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>Mass</span>&nbsp;<span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>dt</span><span>;</span>
			<span>obj</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>Position</span>&nbsp;<span>+=</span>&nbsp;<span>obj</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>Velocity</span>&nbsp;<span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>dt</span><span>;</span>
 
			<span>obj</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>Force</span>&nbsp;<span>=</span>&nbsp;<span>vector3</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span>&nbsp;<span>0</span><span>,</span>&nbsp;<span>0</span><span>);</span>&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;reset&nbsp;net&nbsp;force&nbsp;at&nbsp;the&nbsp;end</span>
		<span>}</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>};</span>
</pre>



<p>Note the use of pointers, this forces other systems to take care of the actual storing of objects, leaving the physics engine to worry about physics, not memory allocation.</p>



<p>With this you can simulate all sorts of stuff from objects flying through the sky to solar systems.</p>

<p>You can do a lot with this, but it’s the easy part to be honest, and that’s not what you came for…</p>



<p><strong>Collision detection</strong></p>



<p>Collision detection is more involved, but we can lighten the load by using some clever tricks. Let’s think about what needs to be found first. If we look at some examples of objects colliding, we notice that in most cases there is a point on each shape that is furthest inside the other.</p>

<p>This turns out to be all we need to respond to a collision. From those two points we can find the normal, and how deep the objects are inside one another. This is huge because it means that we can abstract the idea of different shapes away, and only worry about the points in the response.</p>



<p>Let’s jump into the code, we’ll need some helper structs that I’ll note first.</p>



<pre><span>struct</span>&nbsp;<span>CollisionPoints</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>A</span><span>;</span>&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;Furthest&nbsp;point&nbsp;of&nbsp;A&nbsp;into&nbsp;B</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>B</span><span>;</span>&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;Furthest&nbsp;point&nbsp;of&nbsp;B&nbsp;into&nbsp;A</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>Normal</span><span>;</span>&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;B&nbsp;–&nbsp;A&nbsp;normalized</span>
	<span>float</span>&nbsp;<span>Depth</span><span>;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;Length&nbsp;of&nbsp;B&nbsp;–&nbsp;A</span>
	<span>bool</span>&nbsp;<span>HasCollision</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
 
<span>struct</span>&nbsp;<span>Transform</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;Describes&nbsp;an&nbsp;objects&nbsp;location</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>Position</span><span>;</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>Scale</span><span>;</span>
	<span>quaternion</span>&nbsp;<span>Rotation</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</pre>



<p>Each shape will have a different type of collider to hold its properties and a base to allow them to be stored. Any type of collider should be able to test for a collision with any other type, so we’ll add functions in the base for each one. These functions will take <em>Transforms</em>, so the colliders can use relative coordinates. I’ll only demonstrate spheres and planes, but the code is repeatable for any number of colliders.</p>



<pre><span>struct</span>&nbsp;<span>Collider</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>
	<span>virtual</span>&nbsp;<span>CollisionPoints</span>&nbsp;<span>TestCollision</span><span>(</span>
		<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>Transform</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>transform</span><span>,</span>
		<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>Collider</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>collider</span><span>,</span>
		<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>Transform</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>colliderTransform</span><span>)</span>&nbsp;<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>=</span>&nbsp;<span>0</span><span>;</span>
 
	<span>virtual</span>&nbsp;<span>CollisionPoints</span>&nbsp;<span>TestCollision</span><span>(</span>
		<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>Transform</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>transform</span><span>,</span>
		<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>SphereCollider</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>sphere</span><span>,</span>
		<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>Transform</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>sphereTransform</span><span>)</span>&nbsp;<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>=</span>&nbsp;<span>0</span><span>;</span>
 
	<span>virtual</span>&nbsp;<span>CollisionPoints</span>&nbsp;<span>TestCollision</span><span>(</span>
		<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>Transform</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>transform</span><span>,</span>
		<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>PlaneCollider</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>plane</span><span>,</span>
		<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>Transform</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>planeTransform</span><span>)</span>&nbsp;<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>=</span>&nbsp;<span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</pre>



<p>Let’s make both types of colliders at the same time too see how they interact. A sphere is defined as a point and a radius, and a plane is defined as a vector and a distance. We’ll override the functions from <em>Collider</em>, but won’t worry about the work for now.</p>



<p>We can choose per collider which other colliders it will detect by filling, or not filling, in these functions. In this case, we don’t want Plane v Plane collisions, so we return an empty <em>CollisionPoints</em>.</p>



<pre><span>struct</span>&nbsp;<span>SphereCollider</span>
	<span>:</span>&nbsp;<span>Collider</span>
<span>{</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>Center</span><span>;</span>

	<span>{</span>
		<span>return</span>&nbsp;<span>algo</span><span>::</span><span>FindSphereSphereCollisionPoints</span><span>(</span>
			<span>this</span><span>,</span>&nbsp;<span>transform</span><span>,</span>&nbsp;<span>sphere</span><span>,</span>&nbsp;<span>sphereTransform</span><span>);</span>
	<span>}</span>
 
	<span>CollisionPoints</span>&nbsp;<span>TestCollision</span><span>(</span>
		<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>Transform</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>transform</span><span>,</span>

	<span>}</span>
<span>};</span></pre>



<p>We can add a function for testing the base and use a technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_dispatch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">double dispatch</a>. This takes advantage of the type system to determine both types of colliders for us by swapping the arguments, determining the first, then the second type through two calls of TestCollision. This saves us needing to know what type of colliders we are checking, which means we’ve fully abstracted away the notion of different shapes outside the collision detection.</p>

    <!--  end  -->
    <p>2020 has flipped the investment scene upside down: retail investors are now in charge. It first struck me when i picked the <a href="https://shyal.com/blog/tesla-stock-bottom-date">tesla stock bottom date</a> while professional financial advisors, professional investors, and economics professors missed the entire 800% move.</p>
<h2 id="millenials-hold-the-reins">Millenials hold the reins</h2>
<p>Don't want to take my word for it? Then in the words of billionaire investor Chamath Paliphpitiya:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Retail investors now have access to so much information that it's almost on parity with people that work in traditional investment organisations" -- Chamath Palihapitiya</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 48.png" src="https://shyal.com/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2048.png"></p>
<h2 id="the-importance-of-retail-flows">The importance of retail flows</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.biancoresearch.com/about-us/">Jim Bianco</a>, a macro strategist who recently featured on <a href="https://realvision.com/">RealVision</a> also agrees: </p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Well, that seems to be what's going on with a lot of this money, even though a traditional AAII account might have half a million dollars in it, and a Robinhood account might have 10,000 just to use a number, that 10,000 will turn over every day or two, that half a million might do three trades a year. That Robinhood account will have a bigger influence on the flow of money in and out of the markets than those other accounts. Citadel says that about 25% of all trading in the markets, they said this to Bloomberg a few weeks ago, is retail investors on peak days, 20% on normal days. Now the third group" -- Jim Bianco @ RealVision</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>on peak days, people trading on their apps are actually driving the price action.</li>
<li>the rest of the time (non peak days) they still dictate about a third of the price action.</li>
</ul>
<p>The average Robinhood investor is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/robinhood-profiles-morgan-stanley-etrade">30 years old</a>. </p>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 51.png" src="https://shyal.com/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2051.png"></p>
<h2 id="listen-to-the-millennials-who-have-savings">Listen to the Millennials (who have savings)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGberGnxiJk">Thomas Lee</a> also agrees, and has been warning us that Millennials are now entering into their peak income years. It turns out Millennials love <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/growthstock.asp">"growth stocks"</a> (companies which re-invest in themselves and focus on exponential growth).</p>
<p>If TSLA teaches us anything, it is that big disruptive growth stock companies have become too complex for traditional finance to analyze under their existing lense. They'll often blend AI, SAAS, economies of scale, etc. and require a more technologically versed group of analysts to properly price.</p>
<p>Maybe this is something Millenials can do, natively, especially when not pressured by their boomer CEOs while working in the traditional fin jobs? After all, Millenials grew up programming their parents' VCRs.</p>
<p>Another thesis is that <strong>it doesn't matter whether millennials are right or wrong</strong>. They are now calling the shots. If they say it's right, then it's right.</p>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 50.png" src="https://shyal.com/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2050.png"></p>
<h2 id="ditch-your-hedge-fund">Ditch your hedge fund</h2>
<p>We now know that hedge funds are basically a money-making myth:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hedge funds lost 3.8% of assets globally in 2019, the most since 2009" --<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/clients-withdrew-nearly-1-of-all-hedge-fund-assets-in-december-2020-02-18">market watch</a></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also ditch your financial advisor if they missed all the important trends of 2020. They'll tell you that you cannot live without them; they'll enter self-preservation mode, but remember they make money from you; and the data is showing they should start paying you for advice, not vice versa.</p>
<h2 id="to-sum-up">To sum up</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do your own research, you have access to as much information as investment firms.</li>
<li>Listen to 30 year olds. What companies do they like? <strong>30 year olds dictate the trends</strong>.</li>
<li>Research <strong>good</strong> investment apps: apps that let you directly buy:<ul>
<li>Stocks</li>
<li>Commodities</li>
<li>Bitcoin</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Start <strong>small</strong>, while you learn.</li>
</ul>
<p>You are now in charge.</p>
