					<h3>Introduction / Warning</h3>
<p>Any traditional introductory statistics course will teach students the definitions of modes, medians and means. But, because introductory courses can’t assume that students have much mathematical maturity, the close relationship between these three summary statistics can’t be made clear. This post tries to remedy that situation by making it clear that all three concepts arise as specific parameterizations of a more general problem.</p>
<p>To do so, I’ll need to introduce one non-standard definition that may trouble some readers. In order to simplify my exposition, let’s all agree to assume that \(0^0 = 0\). In particular, we’ll want to assume that \(|0|^0 = 0\), even though \(|\epsilon|^0 = 1\) for all \(\epsilon &gt; 0\). This definition is non-standard, but it greatly simplifies what follows and emphasizes the conceptual unity of modes, medians and means.</p>
<h3>Constructing a Summary Statistic</h3>
<p>To see how modes, medians and means arise, let’s assume that we have a list of numbers, \((x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)\), that we want to summarize. We want our summary to be a single number, which we’ll call \(s\). How should we select \(s\) so that it summarizes the numbers,  \((x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)\), effectively?</p>
<p>To answer that, we’ll assume that \(s\) is an effective summary of the entire list if the typical discrepancy between \(s\) and each of the \(x_i\) is small. With that assumption in place, we only need to do two things: (1) define the notion of discrepancy between two numbers, \(x_i\) and \(s\);  and (2) define the notion of a typical discrepancy. Because each number \(x_i\) produces its own discrepancy, we’ll need to introduce a method for aggregating the individual discrepancies to order to say something about the typical discrepancy.</p>
<h3>Defining a Discrepancy</h3>
<p>We could define the discrepancy between a number \(x_i\) and another number \(s\) in many ways. For now, we’ll consider only three possibilities. All of these three options satisfies a basic intuition we have about the notion of discrepancy: we expect that the discrepancy between \(x_i\) and \(s\) should be \(0\) if \(|x_i – s| = 0\) and that the discrepancy should be greater than \(0\) if \(|x_i – s| &gt; 0\). That leaves us with one obvious question: how much greater should the discrepancy be when \(|x_i – s| &gt; 0\)?</p>
<p>To answer that question, let’s consider three definitions of the discrepancy, \(d_i\):</p>
<ol>
<li>\(d_i = |x_i – s|^0\)</li>
<li>\(d_i = |x_i – s|^1\)</li>
<li>\(d_i = |x_i – s|^2\)</li>
</ol>
<p>How should we think about these three possible definitions?</p>
<p>The first definition, \(d_i = |x_i – s|^0\), says that the discrepancy is \(1\) if \(x_i \neq s\) and is \(0\) only when \(x_i = s\). This notion of discrepancy is typically called <b>zero-one loss</b> in machine learning. Note that this definition implies that anything other than exact equality produces a constant measure of discrepancy. Summarizing \(x_i = 2\) with \(s = 0\) is no better nor worse than using \(s = 1\). In other words, the discrepancy does not increase at all as \(s\) gets further and further from \(x_i\). You can see this reflected in the far-left column of the image below:</p>
<center><br>
<img src="http://www.johnmyleswhite.com/notebook/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/discrepancy1.png" alt="Discrepancy" title="discrepancy.png" width="800" height="466"><br>
</center>
<p>The second definition, \(d_i = |x_i – s|^1\), says that the discrepancy is equal to the distance between \(x_i\) and \(s\). This is often called an <b>absolute deviation</b> in machine learning. Note that this definition implies that the discrepancy should increase linearly as \(s\) gets further and further from \(x_i\). This is reflected in the center column of the image above.</p>
<p>The third definition, \(d_i = |x_i – s|^2\), says that the discrepancy is the squared distance between \(x_i\) and \(s\). This is often called a <b>squared error</b> in machine learning. Note that this definition implies that the discrepancy should increase super-linearly as \(s\) gets further and further from \(x_i\). For example, if \(x_i = 1\) and \(s = 0\), then the discrepancy is \(1\). But if \(x_i = 2\) and \(s = 0\), then the discrepancy is \(4\). This is reflected in the far right column of the image above.</p>
<p>When we consider a list with a single element, \((x_1)\), these definitions all suggest that we should choose the same number: namely, \(s = x_1\).</p>
<h3>Aggregating Discrepancies</h3>
<p>Although these definitions do not differ for a list with a single element, they suggest using very different summaries of a list with more than one number in it. To see why, let’s first assume that we’ll aggregate the discrepancy between \(x_i\) and \(s\) for each of the \(x_i\) into a single summary of the quality of a proposed value of \(s\). To perform this aggregation, we’ll sum up the discrepancies over each of the \(x_i\) and call the result \(E\).</p>
<p>In that case, our three definitions give three interestingly different possible definitions of the typical discrepancy, which we’ll call \(E\) for error:<br>
$$<br>
E_0 = \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^0.<br>
$$</p>
<p>$$<br>
E_1 = \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^1.<br>
$$</p>
<p>$$<br>
E_2 = \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^2.<br>
$$</p>
<p>When we write down these expressions in isolation, they don’t look very different. But if we select \(s\) to minimize each of these three types of errors, we get very different numbers. And, surprisingly, each of these three numbers will be very familiar to us.</p>
<h3>Minimizing Aggregate Discrepancies</h3>
<p>For example, suppose that we try to find \(s_0\) that minimizes the zero-one loss definition of the error of a single number summary. In that case, we require that,<br>
$$<br>
s_0 = \arg \min_{s} \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^0.<br>
$$<br>
What value should \(s_0\) take on? If you give this some extended thought, you’ll discover two things: (1) there is not necessarily a single best value of \(s_0\), but potentially many different values; and (2) each of these best values is one of the <b>modes</b> of the \(x_i\).</p>
<p>In other words, the best single number summary of a set of numbers, when you use exact equality as your metric of error, is one of the modes of that set of numbers.</p>
<p>What happens if we consider some of the other definitions? Let’s start by considering \(s_1\):<br>
$$<br>
s_1 = \arg \min_{s} \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^1.<br>
$$<br>
Unlike \(s_0\), \(s_1\) is a unique number: it is the <b>median</b> of the \(x_i\). That is, the best summary of a set of numbers, when you use absolute differences as your metric of error, is the median of that set of numbers.</p>
<p>Since we’ve just found that the mode and the median appear naturally, we might wonder if other familiar basic statistics will appear. Luckily, they will. If we look for,<br>
$$<br>
s_2 = \arg \min_{s} \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^2,<br>
$$<br>
we’ll find that, like \(s_1\), \(s_2\) is again a unique number. Moreover, \(s_2\) is the <b>mean</b> of the \(x_i\). That is, the best summary of a set of numbers, when you use squared differences as your metric of error, is the mean of that set of numbers.</p>
<p>To sum up, we’ve just seen that the three most famous single number summaries of a data set are very closely related: they all minimize the average discrepancy between \(s\) and the numbers being summarized. They only differ in the type of discrepancy being considered:</p>
<ol>
<li>The mode minimizes the number of times that one of the numbers in our summarized list is not equal to the summary that we use.</li>
<li>The median minimizes the average distance between each number and our summary.</li>
<li>The mean minimizes the average squared distance between each number and our summary.</li>
</ol>
<p>In equations,</p>
<ol>
<li>\(\text{The mode of } x_i = \arg \min_{s} \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^0\)</li>
<li>\(\text{The median of } x_i = \arg \min_{s} \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^1\)</li>
<li>\(\text{The mean of } x_i = \arg \min_{s} \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^2\)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>We’ve just seen that the mode, median and mean all arise from a simple parametric process in which we try to minimize the average discrepancy between a single number \(s\) and a list of numbers, \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) that we try to summarize using \(s\). In a future blog post, I’ll describe how the ideas we’ve just introduced relate to the concept of \(L_p\) norms. Thinking about minimizing \(L_p\) norms is a generalization of taking modes, medians and means that leads to almost every important linear method in statistics — ranging from linear regression to the SVD.</p>

	<p><small>July 10, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Recently, the Go blog had <a href="https://blog.golang.org/module-compatibility">Keeping your Modules Compatible</a> which is about
doing exactly that as you add features and want to expand your
module's API. When the module's API involves interfaces, one of
the approaches they suggested is what I've called <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/GoInterfaceSmuggling">interface
smuggling</a> and what other people have
called <em>interface upgrades</em>. Let me quote the article:</p>

<blockquote><p>When you run into a case where you want to add a method to an existing
interface, you may be able to follow this strategy. Start by creating
a new interface with your new method, or identify an existing
interface with the new method. Next, identify the relevant functions
that need to support it, type check for the second interface, and add
code that uses it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a quite popular approach, one used by many packages in Go's
standard library and third party packages. However, it has a dark
side, and that is its unfortunate effects on middleware.</p>

<p>The problem for middleware is best illustrated by the most common
sort of middleware, which is things that interpose in the chain of
HTTP handlers to modify the results. Much middleware wants to look
at or act on some aspect of the HTTP reply, for example <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/GoPrometheusMetricLabels">to gather
metrics based on the result code</a>, which
means that it must modify and proxy the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#ResponseWriter"><code>http.ResponseWriter</code></a> passed to child
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Handler"><code>http.Handler</code></a>s. Over
time the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/"><code>http</code> package</a> has
acquired a whole collection of smuggled interfaces on ResponseWriters,
such as <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#CloseNotifier"><code>http.CloseNotifier</code></a> (which is deprecated),
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Flusher"><code>http.Flusher</code></a>,
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Hijacker"><code>http.Hijacker</code></a>, and
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Pusher"><code>http.Pusher</code></a>. In the
future there will probably be more.</p>

<p>(In addition, the ResponseWriter may or may not support
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/io/#ReaderFrom"><code>io.ReaderFrom</code></a>.)</p>

<p>If you're a piece of middleware, the ResponseWriter you're passed
may support some, many, or all of these additional APIs. However,
Go provides you no good way to pass this support through your proxy
ResponseWriter that you're going to pass to children Handlers. The
Prometheus people try hard to do it anyway, and <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang/blob/master/prometheus/promhttp/delegator.go">the result is
rather messy</a>
and involves a combinatorial explosion of the possible combinations
of APIs. As the case of io.ReaderFrom shows, these additional APIs
don't even necessarily come from the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/"><code>http</code> package</a>. A smuggled
interface from anywhere may need to be supported.</p>

<p>One answer to this is that you just don't support these additional
APIs in your middleware, or you only support a few of them. The
problem with this is that the ResponseWriter and the client code
that people are trying to use your middleware with well have been
developed, tested, and normally used in an environment where these
expanded APIs are used, not cut off. As we all know, if you don't
test it it doesn't work. Your middleware may be the first code to
try to pass the next hop a ResponseWriter with a genuinely narrow
API, because such narrow APIs may mostly come from middleware. And
of course if there are any bugs in the result, people will blame
your middleware.</p>

<p>None of this is insurmountable. But beyond the problems and the
hassles, it means that expanding your API with interface smuggling
is decidedly not transparent if people use middleware with it. And
as a practical matter, some amount of the time your new API will
not be usable until middleware is expanded to cope with it (if it
ever is).</p>

<p>Another problem is that this expansion of middleware to cope with
your new API can't happen until your new API itself is pervasive.
Go currently provides no support for conditional building based on
the version of other packages or the state of their API, so middleware
can't include any use of your new API interfaces until it doesn't
have to build against versions of your package that predate them.</p>

<p>(People can work around this for HTTP middleware because they can
make files build only on specific minimum versions of Go. Your
package doesn't have this magical power; it's something available
only for new APIs in the Go standard library.)</p>

<p>Because nothing is new under the sun, this problem was noticed back
in 2014's <a href="https://avtok.com/2014/11/05/interface-upgrades.html">Interface Upgrades in Go</a>, which is
one of the earliest places to call this pattern an 'interface
upgrade'. The article notes the proxy problem and ends with a call
to use interface upgrades sparingly. This is good advice in my
opinion, but is very much at odds with the idea of routinely using
interface upgrades to expand your API.</p>

<![CDATA[Use Hugo to Update Your GitHub Profile]]>
            </title>

July 10, 2020 | https://roytang.net/2020/07/hugo-update-github-profile/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://roytang.net/2020/07/hugo-update-github-profile/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>So recently Github secretly rolled out a new feature where you can create a file named <code>README.md</code> in a repo named <code>github.com/&lt;your github username&gt;/&lt;your github username&gt;</code>, and that markdown file would be rendered on your Github profile page. It means, you can now put basically anything you want on your Github profile!</p>
<p>I just read this <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jul/10/self-updating-profile-readme/">post from Simon Willson</a> about using this new feature + Github actions and a Python script to automatically generate and update his Github profile. That seemed neat so I thought about how I would do it.</p>
<p>My blog is already setup to publish using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> and <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis-CI</a> whenever I push a commit, so I figured I could just ride on that framework. You can already see this in action on <a href="https://github.com/roytang">my Github profile page</a>! Basically, I publish the <code>README.md</code> using my regular Hugo build, then my Travis script will deploy it to the appropriate repo.</p>
<p>If you’re new to Hugo, the trickiest part of this might be using a custom output format to generate the README.md. This is basically just a bunch of settings in your Hugo config file:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Define a new Markdown media type under <code>mediaTypes</code> in your config file. For a TOML config file, that looks like this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="toml">    [<span>mediaTypes</span>]
        [<span>mediaTypes</span>.<span>"text/markdown"</span>]
            <span>suffixes</span> = [<span>"md"</span>]</code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define a “readme” output format (or whatever you want to name it) under <code>outputFormats</code> in your config file. For a TOML config file, that looks like this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="toml">[<span>outputFormats</span>]
  [<span>outputFormats</span>.<span>readme</span>]
    <span>baseName</span> = <span>"README"</span>
    <span>mediaType</span> = <span>"text/markdown"</span>    </code></pre></div> The <code>baseName</code> here controls the output file name, while the extension is controlled by the suffixes in step 1. The <code>mediaType</code> you use here should match the one in step 1.
</li>
<li>
<p>Next is to specify which pages should have this custom output format. I used my home page for this, so under <code>outputs</code> in the config file I added the name of the output format (“readme”) in my case under “home”:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="toml">[<span>outputs</span>]
  <span>home</span> = [<span>"HTML"</span>, <span>"RSS"</span>, <span>"jsonfeed"</span>, <span>"hfeed"</span>, <span>"readme"</span>]</code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last step, in your theme or your layouts folder, create a file named <code>index.README.md</code>. This will be the template used to generate the README file. Remember that this is a template to generate markdown. You can use all the normal Hugo template functions, but your output should be markdown. Here’s part of what I put in my template, which generates a list of my most recent blog posts:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go-html-template">Latest blog posts:
<span>{{</span> <span>$pages</span> <span>:=</span> <span>first</span> <span>5</span> <span>(</span><span>where</span> <span>site</span><span>.RegularPages</span> <span>"Type"</span> <span>"post"</span><span>)</span> <span>}}</span>    
<span>{{</span> <span>range</span> <span>$pages</span> <span>}}</span>
- [<span>{{</span> <span>.Title</span> <span>}}</span>](<span>{{</span> <span>.Permalink</span> <span>}}</span>)<span>{{</span> <span>end</span> <span>}}</span>

[View all posts](<span>{{</span> <span>.Permalink</span> <span>}}</span>blog)</code></pre></div> If you’re not yet too familiar with Hugo templates, you can maybe just use the above example directly first to see what it outputs. (You might need to replace <code>post</code> with <code>posts</code> or whatever your main post type is).
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have these setup, just run your usual hugo build and check the output folder to see if the README.md file was generated correctly. It should be in the root of the output folder, same place as the <code>index.html</code> for your home page. One problem I encountered with Hugo is that it insists on lowercasing all the output files, so the output file in my case is always <code>readme.md</code> and not <code>README.md</code>. I just solved this by renaming it during the Travis build.</p>
<p>I won’t discuss the travis deployment process anymore here; if you’ve done CI with Travis and Github integration before, it’s relatively straightforward to add a step to copy the readme file from the Hugo build output to the appropriate repository.</p>
<p>After setting this up, my Github profile page now automatically updates with my latest blog posts/notes/shared links! (I didn’t include photos to keep things simple). The update happens every time my site itself gets a new build, so that’s pretty neat. I’ve attached an image of the new Github profile page for reference!</p>

<p>Hi everyone! 👋 If you have been following my blog then you might have already read <a href="https://yasoob.me/posts/reverse-engineering-android-apps-apktool/">the article</a> on reverse engineering an Android app by writing custom smali code. I am still very much a reverse engineering beginner so after that article, I got to learn about Frida. I was told that Frida is much faster and a lot easier for scenarios where I want to snoop on functions. Well, I am glad to report that all the suggestions were absolutely correct.</p>

<p>In this article, I will share some details about how I was able to use it to snoop around the Nike Run Club Android app. The final goal was to extract authentication tokens that Nike generates when you log-in. This was another project on the backburner and what better way to get a project off the back burner by learning something new?</p>

<h2 id="backstory">Backstory</h2>

<p>I am an avid runner. Most of my friends and family know that. When I started this sport I got hooked to Nike Run Club. I used to diligently record each run so that I had a record for all my runs. This went on for 2 years until I found out that most of my new running friends were using Strava. I decided to move over to Strava but was pretty bummed by the lack of data export options in NRC.</p>

<p>There were <a href="https://gist.github.com/niw/858c1ecaef89858893681e46db63db66">documents online</a> about the Nike API and they allowed you to also export your data in the JSON format but I wanted something a bit more automated. Therefore, I decided to do what any other insane person would do and started my journey of reverse-engineering the Nike Run Club APK. I decided to go to the source and figure out if I could reverse engineer the login process and generate tokens in a completely automated fashion.</p>

<p>This article will teach you the basic usage of Frida and how you too can go ahead and snoop around different APKs. But before we go to that part, you need to know how I ended up deciding to reverse engineer the app and not simply do a MITM attack using <code>mitmproxy</code>.</p>

<h2 id="intercept-nrc-traffic">Intercept NRC traffic</h2>

<p>When I started the project, I decided to snoop the traffic using <code>mitmproxy</code>. You can download the NRC APK from <a href="https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/nike-inc/nike-run-club/nike-run-club-3-9-1-release/nike-run-club-3-9-1-2-android-apk-download/">APKMirror</a> to follow along. After downloading it, rename it to <code>nike.apk</code> so that the rest of the commands in this tutorial are version agnostic.</p>

<p>Next, you can use <code>adb</code> to install this APK on the emulator:</p>

<pre><code>$ adb install nike.apk
</code></pre>

<p>Now, you need to run <code>mitmproxy</code>. If you struggle with setting up an emulator or the proxy, refer to <a href="https://yasoob.me/posts/reverse-engineering-android-apps-apktool/">this previous article</a> of mine where I go in slightly more detail about how to do these things. I used the following command to run mitmproxy:</p>

<pre><code>$ mitmproxy --set block_global=false --showhost
</code></pre>

<p>The last thing to do is to install <code>mitmproxy</code> system certificates on the Android emulator by following the <a href="https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/howto-install-system-trusted-ca-android/">official docs</a> and point the emulator to your local <code>mitmproxy</code> instance.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/dd41762550fb0ba98ccba6d98a82f2f31ed30e8e/22386/images/android-re/emulator.png" alt="Emulator proxy settings"></p>

<p>After this setup, I opened up NRC and started checking out the requests in mitmproxy. I was kinda surprised and pretty spooked by the number of analytics requests NRC was sending. There was no SSL pinning in place so I didn’t have to do anything special before all requests started showing up. All these 68 requests were before I even signed in:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7ace7aada69a0d6a0ed5eeaab40af9fb3292ce8c/199ba/images/android-re/mitmproxy-nike-all.png" alt="mitmproxy all requests"></p>

<p>When I tried signing in, I saw this login request:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/d1612f6255723b63669f77bd985fcf4d326a1db2/3cac0/images/android-re/mitmproxy-login-request.png" alt="Login request"></p>

<p>It looks like a legit login request. But what is that <code>client_id</code>? Everything else seems reasonable and is something we can produce on our own but the <code>client_id</code> seems pretty <em>unique</em>. Where is it coming from?</p>

<p>I checked out a couple of requests before and after this particular API call and couldn’t find the <code>client_id</code> anywhere. It had to be generated within the APK itself. I tried replaying the request a couple of times in <code>mitmproxy</code> and it started failing after 2-3 successful replays. I started receiving this response:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;HEAD&gt;
  &lt;TITLE&gt;Access Denied&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;
  &lt;H1&gt;Access Denied&lt;/H1&gt;
    You don't have permission to access "http://unite.nike.com/login?" on this server.
  &lt;P&gt;
    Reference #18.2eaf3817.1593493058.26b69156
&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>There was something dynamic in the request and I just had to figure out what. This was the perfect excuse to start snooping inside the NRC app.</p>

<p>By the way, the NRC app makes heavy use of HTML in their app. The login page is actually an HTML document and is loaded from the server. You can access it at <a href="https://unite.nike.com/s3/unite/mobile.html?androidSDKVersion=3.1.0&amp;corsoverride=https://unite.nike.com&amp;uxid=com.nike.sport.running.droid.3.8&amp;locale=en_US&amp;backendEnvironment=identity&amp;view=login&amp;clientId=WLr1eIG5JSNNcBJM3npVa6L76MK8OBTt&amp;facebookAppId=84697719333&amp;wechatAppId=wxde7d0246cfaf32f7">this url</a>. More about this later.</p>

<h2 id="decompile-nrc-apk">Decompile NRC APK</h2>

<p>I assume you already downloaded the NRC APK from <a href="https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/nike-inc/nike-run-club/nike-run-club-3-9-1-release/nike-run-club-3-9-1-2-android-apk-download/">APKMirror</a> and renamed it to <code>nike.apk</code>. I uploaded the APK to <a href="http://www.javadecompilers.com/apk">this online version of jadx</a> and decompiled it. We are on the hunt for the <code>client_id</code> and the first thing I do whenever I am trying to find a string, I use grep:</p>

<pre><code>$ grep -r `client_id` ./
</code></pre>

<p>Ooo it did output quite a bunch of stuff. This seems to be the most interesting string:</p>

<pre><code>./resources/res/values/strings.xml:    &lt;string name="unite_client_id"&gt;IFc97q8fSoR84EHfevnzBNivAiT6H+i8vmVZDnCAax/ZjSGxw5ejdekfXtCrzrtJrQfJnj30JeK+MsyruZi8sW6iUBfe//NGZlpQJXUbz8LuPEXnLMAlxKdLV6BrBgKHqNI94nfSHCCr0xW3HOZk/XyFdevndG52zmZR0XXym0yW5d8n/XvLGDCtVyryFLYoYwHYrDC9JZ+GfAacPKE5S437fT9Af+Z/AeZgqPplm9mCaPBoOc0Co4+h3nT8TvXMsU4Vy8pRTuWv0skMU0uwUkq7R/UN06daQ8AkAaYt7KWG0S36tSbHuR03ji7om8ebOJqOzgFyYOp/KfkHkvX5+PVk2lG7lk1hBltitrBND8njmHHIPisC6+W7Ul1an0mRiNTQVFfSJpyNUVvE1D17NQ==&lt;/string&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><code>grep</code> also told me where it was being decrypted:</p>

<pre><code>./sources/com/nike/plusgps/login/UniteConfigFactory.java:        UniteConfig uniteConfig = new UniteConfig(this.userAgentHeader.getUserAgent(), this.appResources.getString(C5369R.string.unite_experience_id), this.obfuscator.decrypt(this.appResources.getString(C5369R.string.unite_client_id)));
</code></pre>

<p>Based on my previous experience with encryption, this seems to be an AES encrypted string. But I need to make sure this is the actual <code>client_id</code> we saw in the request. Time to use Frida and hook into the APK and figure out what the decrypted value of this string is.</p>

<h2 id="intro-to-frida">Intro to Frida</h2>

<p>According to the <a href="https://frida.re/">official website</a>, Frida is a</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dynamic instrumentation toolkit for developers, reverse-engineers, and security researchers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It allows you to inject scripts in native applications and check out what they are doing under the hood. We will be using it to keep a tab on method inputs in the NRC APK and also make custom calls to different methods. Before we move any further, let’s install Frida first.</p>

<h3 id="frida-installation">Frida installation</h3>

<p>There are two parts of Frida (that I am aware of). Frida client and Frida server. The client runs on the host operating system and the server runs of the Android/iOS device. To make testing easier, it is much better to use an Android emulator with Frida.</p>

<h3 id="installing-the-client-python-packages">Installing the client Python packages</h3>

<p>For the client-side, there are again two separate packages/libraries we can install using <code>pip</code>. One is called <code>frida</code> and the other is called <code>frida-tools</code>. <code>frida</code> allows us to import and use <code>frida</code> in our code while <code>frida-tools</code> provide us with some really useful command-line tools that will help us in the whole reverse engineering process.</p>

<p>Let’s create a new directory and a virtual environment and install both of these packages. We will work on the server part after this.</p>

<pre><code>$ mkdir nike_project
$ cd nike_project
$ python -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install frida frida-tools
</code></pre>

<p>If everything has been installed and set up correctly, <code>frida-ps -h</code> should output something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ frida-ps -h
Usage: frida-ps [options]

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -D ID, --device=ID    connect to device with the given ID
  -U, --usb             connect to USB device
  -R, --remote          connect to remote frida-server
  -H HOST, --host=HOST  connect to remote frida-server on HOST
  -O FILE, --options-file=FILE
                        text file containing additional command line options
  -a, --applications    list only applications
  -i, --installed       include all installed applications
  -j, --json            output results as JSON
</code></pre>

<h3 id="installing-the-frida-server-on-android">Installing the <code>frida-server</code> on Android</h3>

<p>Now we have to install the frida-server on the Android emulator (you can also use your Android device but I prefer the emulator for testing). At the time of writing this article, the latest release of the frida-server is 12.10.4. You can check the latest version at <a href="https://github.com/frida/frida/releases/">GitHub</a>. Just change the version number in the commands below and they should work:</p>

<pre><code>wget https://github.com/frida/frida/releases/download/12.10.4/frida-server-12.10.4-android-x86_64.xz
unxz frida-server-12.10.4-android-x86_64.xz
adb push frida-server-12.10.4-android-x86_64 /data/local/tmp/frida-server
adb shell chmod 755 /data/local/tmp/frida-server
</code></pre>

<p>The above commands downloaded and copied the frida-server to the emulator, now we need to run the server. Open up adb shell:</p>

<pre><code>adb shell
</code></pre>

<p>Now run the next command within <code>adb shell</code>:</p>

<pre><code>/data/local/tmp/frida-server &amp;
</code></pre>

<h2 id="frida-hooking">Frida hooking</h2>

<p>Once we have the <code>frida-server</code> running, we can start prepping our JavaScript code for injection.</p>

<h3 id="prepping-initial-frida-hook">Prepping initial Frida hook</h3>

<p>I checked out the NRC source, followed the breadcrumbs, and found that the decryption magic was happening in the <code>NativeObfuscator</code> file. I found out the process name of the NRC app by running <code>frida-utils -Ua</code> and then wrote the following Python code for testing my hypothesis:</p>

<pre><code>import frida, sys

jscode = """
Java.perform(function (){
    var MainActivity = Java.use('com.nike.plusgps.onboarding.login.WelcomeActivity');
    var ConfFactory = Java.use('com.nike.plusgps.login.UniteConfigFactory');
    var String = Java.use("java.lang.String");
    var obfuscator = Java.use("com.nike.clientconfig.NativeObfuscator");
    var resources = Java.use("android.content.res.Resources");
    var logger = Java.use("com.nike.logger.NopLoggerFactory");
    var strRes = …</code></pre></section></div>

<h3>Concept</h3>
<p>Scenario: You are having an issue and you don’t know how to solve it. You tell someone “Hey, can you help me? Let me tell you my problem!”. You start telling the problem, your conversation partner doesn’t say a word and you say “Yeees, this is it! That’s the solution. Thanks for helping me!”. But you had in fact just a monologue, and you found the solution for yourself.</p>
<p>What if, instead of talking to a human being, you had a constant partner whom you would explain your problems like it were a human being. This is how my teddy bear helps me:</p>
<figure id="attachment_305" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-305"><a href="http://blog.adrianbolboaca.ro/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/TeddyBearParingPartner.jpg"><img title="TeddyBearParingPartner" src="http://blog.adrianbolboaca.ro/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/TeddyBearParingPartner-300x207.jpg" alt="Teddy Bear Pair Programming" width="300" height="207" srcset="https://blog.adrianbolboaca.ro/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/TeddyBearParingPartner-300x207.jpg 300w, https://blog.adrianbolboaca.ro/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/TeddyBearParingPartner-1024x707.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-305">Teddy Bear Pair Programming</figcaption></figure>

<p>This technique is called teddy bear pair programming. My teddy bear helps me when <strong>debugging</strong> some application. I tell him my issues, and I find the answers by myself, he’s that awesome!</p>
<p><em> . . . [an] effective technique is to explain your code to someone else. This will often cause you to explain the bug to yourself. Sometimes it takes no more than a few sentences, followed by an embarrassed “Never mind; I see what’s wrong. Sorry to bother you.” This works remarkably well; you can even use non-programmers as listeners. One university computer center kept a teddy bear near the help desk. Students with mysterious bugs were required to explain them to the teddy bear before they could speak to a human counsellor.</em> (Kernighan, B. W. and R. Pike (1999). The Practice of Programming. Reading, Massachusetts, Addison-Wesley)</p>
<p>When I do <strong>TDD</strong> my teddy bear help me figure out which are the next steps. I talk with him continuously, explaining what I do now, and what are the design choices I make. I need to explain everything to him because he’s so smart that he helps me without saying a word.</p>
<p>When my <strong>IDE</strong> annoys me I tell my teddy bear and I feel a lot better, because he understands me. After all in the teddy bear world they have heavyweight IDE as well.</p>
<p>Your teddy bear will help you with basically anything. You just need to verbalize your problems and ideas. It just makes magic!</p>
<p>I told my colleagues at <a href="http://www.mozaicworks.com/">Mozaic Works</a> about this idea, and as a result the following Open Agile conference they ordered teddy-bears for all the attendees.</p>

<p>Another name for teddy bear paring is the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RubberDucking">Rubber Duckling</a> idea. It’s just that I like teddy bears more than ducks. And teddy bear pair-programming sounds better 🙂</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>A quantum bit or a qubit is a unit of information describing a two-dimensional quantum system. It is also a key basic unit to the quantum computer. Usually it could be visualized using a Bloch sphere.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to derive the connections between qubit and Bloch sphere.</p>

<h3 id="classical-bit">Classical Bit</h3>

<p>A classical bit is a unit of information describing a two-dimensional classical system. A classical bit could only be in one state, either $| 0 \rangle$ or $| 1 \rangle$. $| 0 \rangle$ and $| 1 \rangle$ are orthogonal basis. Usually $| 0 \rangle = [1, 0]^{\top}$ and $| 1 \rangle = [0, 1]^{\top}$.</p>

<h3 id="quantum-bit-qubit">Quantum Bit (Qubit)</h3>

<p>A quantum bit or a qubit is a unit of information describing a two-dimensional quantum system. A qubit is a superposition of two basic states, $| 0 \rangle$ and $| 1 \rangle$.</p>



<p>A generic (normalized) qubit is of the form</p>



<p>where $c_0$ and $c_1$ are complex numbers, and $|c_0|^2 + |c_1|^2 = 1$. After taking the measurement for $| \psi \rangle$, the system would be collapsed to $| 0 \rangle$ with probability $|c_0|^2$ or $| 1 \rangle$ with probability $|c_1|^2$.</p>



<p>A complex number could be described using <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Complex-Number-Representations/">exponential form</a>.</p>



<p>Where $\rho_0$ and $\rho_1$ are real numbers. Therefore,</p>



<p>We could rewrite $\rho_0$ and $\rho_1$ using a new parameter $\frac{\theta}{2}$. We would see why we used $\frac{\theta}{2}$ instead of $\theta$ shortly.</p>



<p>We multiple a complex number $e^{-i\theta_0}$ to $| \psi \rangle$.</p>



<p>We define $\varphi = \theta_1 - \theta_0$, we have</p>



<p>As we have discussed early in <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Quantum-System-States/">quantum system states</a>, quantum system state $| \psi \rangle$ and $c | \psi \rangle$, where $c$ is any non-zero complex number, represent the same quantum system state. Since $e^{-i\theta_0}$ is a non-zero complex number, $| \psi \rangle$ and $e^{-i\theta_0} | \psi \rangle$ represent the same quantum system state. So we have</p>



<p>This means that, with two parameters $\theta$ and $\varphi$, we could determine a qubit state.</p>



<p>The next question is what is the minimum range of $\theta$ and $\varphi$ so that all the possible qubit states, $| \psi \rangle \in \mathbb{C}^2$s, are included? After taking the measurement of the qubit, the probability of observing $| 0 \rangle$ is $\cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}$ and the probability of observing $| 1 \rangle$ is $\sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2}$. For different $\theta$s, if $\cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}$s are the same, the qubit states, $| \psi \rangle$s, are also the same. Apparently, $0 \leq \frac{\theta}{2} \leq \frac{\pi}{2}$, i.e., $0 \leq \theta \leq \pi$. If $\theta$ is out of this range, there is always a way to convert the $\theta$ into the range of $[0, \pi]$ while keeping $\cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}$ the same. For $\varphi$, there is not too much to say, $0 \leq \varphi &lt; 2\pi$.</p>



<p>To summarize, a qubit could be described using two independent variables.</p>



<p>Where $\theta \in [0, \pi]$ and $\varphi \in [0, 2\pi)$.</p>

<h3 id="bloch-sphere">Bloch Sphere</h3>

<p>In quantum mechanics and computing, the Bloch sphere is a geometrical representation of the pure state space of a two-level quantum mechanical system (qubit), named after the physicist Felix Bloch.</p>



<p>Given the two-variable qubit formulation we derived above, it could perfectly fit into the Bloch sphere.</p>

<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://leimao.github.io/images/blog/2020-06-14-Qubit-Bloch-Sphere/Bloch_sphere.svg.png">
    <figcaption>Bloch Sphere</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>The north and south poles of the Bloch sphere are typically chosen to correspond to the standard basis vectors $ |0\rangle $ and $ |1\rangle $, respectively. Any coordinate, which could be uniquely described using $\theta$ and $\varphi$, on the sphere, represents a unique qubit.</p>



<p>It is also non-trivial to see that all the qubits on the equator, where $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$, have equal probability of collapsing to $ |0\rangle $ and $ |1\rangle $, because $p(|0\rangle) = \cos^2 \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$ and $p(|1\rangle) = \sin^2 \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$.</p>



<p>In addition, if the qubit is more closer to the north pole, there is larger chance to collapse to $ |0\rangle $ after taking the measurement. Similarly, if the qubit is more closer to the south pole, there is larger chance to collapse to $ |1\rangle $ after taking the measurement.</p>



<p>Moreover, an arbitrary pair of orthogonal qubits is mapped to antipodal (opposite) points of the Bloch sphere. This is because, any antipodal qubits have the following representations.</p>



<p>We would like to show that $\langle \psi , \psi^{\prime} \rangle = 0$ so that $| \psi \rangle $ and $| \psi^{\prime} \rangle$ are orthogonal.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>



<p>Last but not least, to answer why we had used $\frac{\theta}{2}$ instead of $\theta$ in the qubit representation, it is because we want to make the qubit representation compatible with the Bloch sphere. If using $\frac{\theta}{2}$, $\theta \in [0, \pi]$ in the Bloch sphere matches $\theta \in [0, \pi]$ in the qubit representation.</p>

<p>As we have partially shown in <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Kronecker-Product-In-Circuits/">one of my previous posts</a>, all the classical logical gates could be considered as matrices, and all the classical bit manipulations are matrix multiplications. This also applies to quantum logical gates and qubits. Actually, all the quantum logical gates are unitary matrices. We would take this fact for now and I would probably explain this in my future blog posts.</p>



<p>Matrix $U$ is unitary if and only if</p>



<p>Unitary matrix preserves inner products. If $U$ is unitary, then for any $v, v^{\prime} \in \mathbb{C}^{n}$, we have $\langle Uv, Uv^{\prime} \rangle = \langle v, v^{\prime} \rangle$.</p>



<p>This could be easily proved by using the <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Inner-Product/">inner product properties</a>.</p>



<p>This means that unitary matrix $U$ also preserves the norm of any vector $v \in \mathbb{C}^{n}$.</p>



<p>Suppose we have a qubit $| \psi \rangle$ and unitary matrix $U$. Because $| \psi | = 1$, so $| U\psi | = 1$. In addition, given the orthogonal basis $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$, because $\langle |0\rangle, |1\rangle \rangle = 1$, so $ \langle U|0\rangle, U |1\rangle \rangle = 1$. This means that $U|0\rangle$ and $U|1\rangle$ are a new pair of orthogonal basis.</p>



<p>On the Bloch sphere, applying a unitary matrix $U$ to qubit $| \psi \rangle$ is equivalent to moving the coordinate of the qubit on the Block sphere, since unitary matrix preserves the norm of vector. Apply a unitary matrix $U$ to both $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ is equivalent to rotate the north and south poles, i.e. the coordinate system, accordingly.</p>



<p>If we look into $| U \psi \rangle$ more closely.</p>



<p>Since $U|0\rangle$ and $U|1\rangle$ are also orthogonal basis, manipulating qubit is also equivalent to manipulating the entire coordinate system. The coordinates of $| U \psi \rangle$ in the new coordinate system ($U|0\rangle$, $U|1\rangle$) is the same to the coordinates of $| \psi \rangle$ in the old coordinate system ($|0\rangle$, $|1\rangle$).</p>

<p>Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) has become central to software development. To ensure high-quality software releases smoke tests, regression tests, performance tests, static code analysis &amp; security scans are run in CI/CD pipeline. Despite of all these quality measures, still OutOfMemoryError, CPU spikes, unresponsiveness, degradation in response time are surfacing in production environment.</p>



<p>These sort of performance problems surfaces in production because in CI/CD pipeline only macro level metrics such as: Static code quality metrics, test/code coverage, CPU Utilization, memory consumption, response time… are studied. In several cases these macro-metrics aren’t sufficient enough to uncover performance problems. In this article let’s review the micrometrics that should be studied in CI/CD pipeline to deliver high quality releases in production. We will also learn how to source this micrometrics and integrate it into CI/CD pipeline.</p>



<h3>How Tsunamis are forecasted?</h3>



<p>You might wonder why Tsunami forecasting is related to this article. There is a relationship :-). A normal sea wave travels at a speed of 5 – 60 miles/hr, whereas Tsunami waves travel at a speed of 500 – 600 miles/hr. Even though Tsunami wave travels at a speed of 10x – 100x speed of normal waves, it’s very hard to forecast Tsunami waves. Thus, modern day technologies use micrometrics to forecast Tsunami waves.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://tier1app.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/untitled-design-3.png?w=736" alt="Untitled design (3)" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://tier1app.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/untitled-design-3.png?w=736&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fig: DART Device to detect Tsunami</p>



<p>To forecast Tsunami, <strong><span>multiple DART (Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunami) devices are installed all throughout the world. This DART contains two parts:</span></strong></p>



<p>a. Surface Buoy: Device which floats at the top of ocean water<br>
b. Seabed Monitor: Device which is stationed at the bottom of the ocean</p>



<p>Deep ocean water is about 6000 meters in depth. (20x of tallest San Francisco Sales Force tower). Whenever the sea level rises more than 1 mm then DART automatically detects it and transmits this information to satellite. This 1 mm rise in sea water is a lead indicator of Tsunami origination. I would like to request you to pause here for a second and visualize length of 1 mm in the scale of 6000 meters sea depth. It’s nothing, negligible. But this micrometric analysis is what used for forecasting Tsunamis.</p>



<h4><strong>How to forecast Performance Tsunamis through Micrometrics?</strong></h4>



<p>Similarly, there are few micrometrics that you can monitor in your CI/CD pipeline. This micrometrics are lead indicators of several performance problems that you will face in production. Raise or drop in values of these micrometrics are the great indicators for the origination of performance problems.</p>



<p>1. Garbage Collection Throughput<br>
2. Average GC pause time<br>
3. Maximum GC pause time<br>
4. Object creation rate<br>
5. Peak heap size<br>
6. Thread Count<br>
7. Thread States<br>
8. Thread Groups<br>
9. Wasted Memory<br>
10. Object Count<br>
11. Class Count</p>



<p>Let’s study each micrometrics in detail:</p>



<h3>1. GARBAGE COLLECTION THROUGHPUT</h3>



<p>Garbage Collection throughout is the amount of time your application spends in processing customer transactions vs amount of time your application spends in doing garbage collection.</p>



<p>Let’s say your application has been running for 60 minutes. In this 60 minutes, 2 minutes is spent on GC activities.<br>
It means application has spent 3.33% on GC activities (i.e. 2 / 60 * 100)<br>
It means Garbage Collection throughput is 96.67% (i.e. 100 – 3.33).</p>



<p>When there is a degradation in the GC throughput, it’s an indication of some sort of memory problem. Now the question is: What is the acceptable throughput %? It depends on the application and business demands. Typically, one should target for more than 98% throughput.</p>



<h3>2. AVERAGE GARBAGE COLLECTION PAUSE TIME</h3>



<p>When Garbage Collection event runs, entire application pauses. Because Garbage Collection has to mark every object in the application, see whether those objects are referenced by other objects, if there is no references then it will have to be evicted from memory. Then fragmented memory has to be compacted. To do all these operations, application will be paused. Thus when Garbage collection runs, customer will experience pauses/delays. Thus one should always target to attain low average GC pause time.</p>



<h3>3. MAX GARBAGE COLLECTION PAUSE TIME</h3>



<p>Some Garbage collection events might take a few milliseconds, whereas some garbage collection events might also take several seconds to minutes. You should measure maximum garbage collection pause time, to understand the worst possible impact to the customer. Proper tuning (and if needed application code changes) are needed to reduce the maximum Garbage Collection pause time.</p>



<h3>4. OBJECT CREATION RATE</h3>



<p>Object creation rate is the average amount of objects created by your application. Maybe in your previous code commit, application was creating 100mb/sec. Starting from recent code commit, application started to create 150mb/sec. This additional object creation rate can trigger lot more GC activity, CPU spikes, potential OutOfMemoryError, memory leaks when application is running for longer period.</p>



<h3>5. PEAK HEAP SIZE</h3>



<p>Peak heap size is the maximum amount of memory consumed by your application. If peak heap size goes beyond a limit you must investigate it. Maybe there is a potential memory leak in the application, newly introduced code (or 3rd libraries/frameworks) is consuming lot of memory, maybe there is legitimate use of it, if it is the case you will have change your JVM arguments to allocate more memory.</p>



<p>“Garbage collection throughput, average GC pause time, maximum GC pause time, object creation rate, peak heap size micrometrics can be sourced only from garbage collection logs. No other tools can be used for this purpose.<br> As part of your CI/CD pipeline, you need to run regression test suite or performance test (ideal). Garbage Collection logs generated from the test, should be passed to <a rel="noopener" href="https://blog.gceasy.io/2016/06/18/garbage-collection-log-analysis-api/" target="_blank"><span>GCeasy’s REST API</span></a>. This API analyzes garbage collection logs and responds back with above mentioned micrometrics. To learn where this micrometrics are sent in the API response and JSON path expression for them, <a rel="noopener" href="https://blog.gceasy.io/2018/07/02/key-elements-in-api-response/" target="_blank"><span> to this article</span></a>. If any value is breached, then build can be failed. GCeasy REST API has intelligence to detect various other garbage collection problems such as: memory leaks, user time &gt; sys + real time, sys time &gt; user time, invocation of System.gc() API calls,… Any detected GC problems will be reported in the ‘problem’ element of API response. You might want to track this element as well”.</p>



<h3>6. THREAD COUNT</h3>



<p>Thread count can be another key metric to monitor. If thread count goes beyond a limit it can cause CPU, memory problems. Too many threads can cause ‘java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread’ in the long-running production environment.</p>



<h3>7. THREAD STATES</h3>



<p>Application threads can be in different thread states. To learn about various thread states, refer to this <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzYLtYaJ_D0" target="_blank"><span>quick video clip</span></a>. Too many threads in RUNNABLE state can cause CPU spike. Too many threads in BLOCKED state can make application unresponsive. If number of threads in a particular thread state crosses certain threshold then you may consider generating appropriate alerts/warning in CI/CD report.</p>



<h3>8. THREAD GROUPS</h3>



<p>A thread group represents a collection of threads performing similar tasks. There could be a servlet container thread group that processes all the incoming HTTP requests. There could be a JMS thread group, which handles all the JMS sending, receiving activity. There could be some other sensitive thread groups in the application as well. You might want to track those sensitive thread groups size. You don’t want their size neither to drop below a threshold nor go beyond a threshold. Less number of threads in a thread group can stall the activities. More number of threads can lead to memory, CPU problems.</p>



<p>“Thread count, thread states, thread groups micrometrics can be sourced from thread dumps. As part of your CI/CD pipeline, you need to run regression test suite or performance test (ideal). 3 Thread dumps in a gap of 10 seconds interval should be captured when tests are running. Captured thread dumps should be passed to <a rel="noopener" href="https://blog.fastthread.io/2016/10/27/thread-dump-analysis-api/" target="_blank"><span>FastThread’s REST API</span></a>. This API analyzes thread dumps and responds back with the above mentioned micrometrics.<br> To learn where this micrometrics are sent in the API response and JSON path expression for them, refer <a rel="noopener" href="https://blog.fastthread.io/2018/07/02/key-elements-in-api-response/" target="_blank"><span>to this article</span></a>. If any value is breached, then build can be failed”. FastThread REST API has intelligence to detect several threading problems such as: Deadlocks, CPU spiking threads, prolonged blocking threads, … Any detected problems will be reported in the ‘problem’ element of API response. You might want to track this element as well”.</p>



<h3>9. WASTED MEMORY</h3>



<p>In modern computing world lot of memory is wasted because of poor programming practices such as: duplicate object creation, duplicate string creation, inefficient collections implementations, sub-optimal data type definitions, inefficient finalizations,.. <a rel="noopener" href="https://blog.heaphero.io/2018/06/22/heap-dump-analysis-api/" target="_blank"><span>Heap Hero API</span></a> detects an amount of memory wasted due to all these inefficient programming practices. This can be a key metric to track. In case if amount wasted memory goes beyond certain percentage, then CI/CD build can be failed, or warnings can be generated.</p>



<h3>10. OBJECT COUNT</h3>



<p>You might also want to track the total number of objects that are present in the application’s memory. Object count can spike up because of inefficient code, new introduction of 3rd party libraries, frameworks. Too many objects can cause OutOfMemoryError, memory leak, CPU spike in production.</p>



<h3>11. CLASS COUNT</h3>



<p>You might also want to track the total number of classes that are present in the application’s memory. Sometimes class count can spike because of an introduction of any 3rd party libraries, frameworks. Spike in classes count, can cause problems in Metaspace/PermGen space of the memory.</p>

<p>The Lyceum Institute provides a digital environment dedicated to fostering the philosophical habit–of questioning the truth of things and the good of life–in all its members, as we collectively pursue the never-ending education of a truly mind-liberating nature. Much of education depends upon the atmosphere in which we immerse ourselves, and, in the twenty-first century, we all inhabit a digital atmosphere. The Lyceum Institute seeks a continual, communal, and thoughtful ennobling of that atmosphere.</p>







<h2>A Better Digital Life</h2>



<p>The Lyceum Institute seeks to aid its members pursuit of better habits, especially of careful thinking, and not just the preservation of truth, but its strengthening. &nbsp;This is not a program, a course, a certification process, nor simply a place to find content for passive consumption, but rather something to become a part of one’s life: a digital medium that directs one towards the development of perfective human habits, rather than deviant ones; habits of humility, generosity, insightful interpretation, willingness to hear, ardor for the truth and deepening one’s understanding, security in forming one’s beliefs, contentment, and worldly detachment.&nbsp; It is an enclave for thinking, differentiated from the world “outside” not by viewing it through a lens of gnosticism, but by instilling and maintaining a dispassionate devotion to the truth.&nbsp; It is where one may go after having observed the chaos, the disorder, the blind ideological adherence, and the sophistical machinations of the wider “intellectual” world, to learn, study, think, and most of all converse with others following a common path.&nbsp; It seeks the improvement of individual understanding through communal effort in fostering philosophical habit.</p>



<p>Digital life allows for unique educational opportunity. For one needs to do more than merely read books or blogs or articles to become educated: education always being a matter of a certain training, which entails not only reading or passive consumption of information, but the interpretative processing of that which is received and—perhaps most importantly of all—a critical conversation with others through which that interpretation may be refined and improved. No mind lives and thrives all on its own, and while reading the works of great writers is an encounter with their minds, it is one-directional only. Something more is needed—other persons, who bring not only their own minds, but all the minds they have read, all the minds they have encountered, in some way to your own.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Enrollment in the Lyceum Institute is open to all-comers: graduate and undergraduate students, professors, clergy, the philosophically-seeking general public, and so on.&nbsp; Experts and novices alike profit from the community of common purpose and the mutual support in the pursuit of bettered habits.&nbsp; It is affordable (costing less per month than most streaming entertainment services); accessible by computer, tablet, or phone, wherever one has an internet connect; and always-improving.</p>



<h2>Inquirere, Ordinare, Memorare</h2>



<p>This unique digital environment emerges from the practice of the three parts of the Institute Motto: Inquirere, Ordinare, Memorare — to inquire, to remember, and to order.</p>



<p>Why these three actions?</p>



<p>The Lyceum Institute, being a digital&nbsp;environment, is adapted to fit and fructify the habits enabled by the nature of networked digital technology–which, at its core, is archival.&nbsp; That is, the very nature of digital architecture is to receive and retain bits of information that can represent nearly anything.&nbsp; Anything done online can be archived: captured in an arrangement of data and saved for posterity; it thus extends our memorative&nbsp;habits and capacities.</p>



<p>But consequently, for this archivality to be rightly leveraged, digital technology demands a habit of categorical consideration–a habit of ordering: as any good archive must be well-ordered, and approached with an ordered mind, for it to be used properly.</p>



<p>Furthermore, this demands of us an improved capacity for questioning; that is, no quantity of archived information, no matter how well it is organized, can tell us what we need to know if we do not even know how to ask the right questions.&nbsp; Moreover, what to do with that information requires not simply “the” right question, but a habit of knowing how to formulate those questions and pursue the answers.&nbsp; See <a href="https://cpinsightcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/2020-05-lyceuminstitute_educationdigitallife.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Education and Digital Life</a> for more details.</p>



<h2>Memberships</h2>



<p>Enrollment in the Lyceum Institute is sorted into three tiers: Basic, Advanced, and Premium.&nbsp; Please note that there is a $6/mo technology cost for each tier, <em>included</em> in the monthly charge.*</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>Basic Lyceum Enrollment</th><th>Advanced Lyceum Enrollment</th><th>Premium Lyceum Enrollment</th></tr><tr><td>Access to the Lyceum Institute</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Persons per account</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Access to Philosophical Resources</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Access to <i>Quaestiones Disputatae</i></td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Access to Language Studies</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Access to Lecture Recordings</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Access to Seminar Recordings &amp; Advanced Research Archive</td><td></td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>PDFs of all CPI Publications</td><td></td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Seminar access</td><td></td><td>2 included</td><td>6 included</td></tr><tr><td>Additional seminar discounts</td><td>35% on one<br>

                <p><em>Last updated 2019-12-04</em></p><hr>
                
                <p>When aspiring musicians first learn to play their instruments, they rarely start composing their own songs immediately. Most start by learning to play the songs of others. This allows them to focus on skills like intonation, dynamics, and tempo. The skill of composition can wait until they have developed good playing technique.</p>

<p>By contrast, aspiring writers almost always create their own content right from the start. Have you ever heard a conversation like this?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œIâ€™m working on a novel.â€�</p>

  <p>â€œCool, whatâ€™s it about?â€�</p>

  <p>â€œItâ€™s Harry Potter and the Philosopherâ€™s Stone.â€�</p>

  <p>â€œOh, you mean like a fanfic?â€�</p>

  <p>â€œNo, Iâ€™m telling the story of Harryâ€™s first year at Hogwarts.â€�</p>

  <p>â€œBut youâ€™re not putting a spin on it or anything?â€�</p>

  <p>â€œNope, itâ€™s the same as the story told in the original.â€�</p>

  <p>â€œWord for word?â€�</p>

  <p>â€œNo, but arc for arc. Rowlingâ€™s story, my words.â€�</p>

  <p>â€œHuh. Sort of like a cover.â€�</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wish writing covers were considered totally normal. Iâ€™m not talking about adaptations, like Joyceâ€™s <em>Ulysses</em> (an adaptation of <em>The Odyssey</em>, set in 20th century Dublin), although I would love to see more of those too. By â€œcoversâ€�, I mean high-fidelity recreations of other peopleâ€™s written worksâ€”comprehensive paraphrases.</p>

<p>Writing is hard. When youâ€™re learning to write, you have to worry about coherence, organization, and word choice. Thatâ€™s a lot to keep track of. Writing covers is a great way to refine these skills without needing to worry about originality. If writing covers were normal, we could all practice more and improve faster.</p>

<p>There would also be better, and more niche, versions of many written works. Imagine: <em>Jane Eyre</em>, covered by J.K. Rowling. <em>On the Origin of Species</em>, covered by Richard Dawkins. <em>Twilight</em>, covered by Margaret Atwood. Covers like these do exist, but too few. A few months ago I <a href="https://twitter.com/davidklaing/status/1158132219484893184">tweeted</a> about this idea, and Kevin Simler <a href="https://twitter.com/KevinSimler/status/1158136084951261185">boosted</a> it to his 16,000 followers, asking for examples<sup>1</sup>. Here are some good ones:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hunter S. Thompson covered parts of The Great Gatsby. According to Louis Menandâ€™s <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/03/07/believer">obituary of Thompson</a> in <em>The New Yorker</em>, Thompson â€œused to type out pages from <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, just to get the feeling, he said, of what it was like to write that wayâ€�.</li>
  <li>Benjamin Franklin covered articles in the <em>Spectator</em>. He says in his <a href="https://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page06.htm">autobiography</a>, â€œI took some of the papers, and making short hints of the sentiment in each sentence, laid them by a few days, and then, without looking at the book, tried to complete the papers again, by expressing each hinted sentiment at length, and as fully as it had been expressed before, in any suitable words that should come to hand.â€�</li>
  <li>Visakan Veerasamy <a href="http://www.visakanv.com/blog/politics-and-the-english-language/">covered</a> George Orwellâ€™s essay, â€œPolitics and the English Languageâ€�. He says in an introductory comment, â€œThe following is my attempt to update George Orwellâ€™s essay <a href="http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit/">Politics and the English Language (1946)</a> for modern reading. Iâ€™ve tried to follow his own principles to make his words sharper and clearer where I can.â€�</li>
</ul>

<p>Look, I get it: we want to be recognized for our own ideas. And when the original source material is just a hyperlink away, why go to the trouble of paraphrasing it? One reason is that it challenges you to internalize the original authorâ€™s way of thinking. It is the deepest possible way to read a text. Another reason is that if you choose texts that are hard to paraphrase, you will stretch yourself to reproduce material that is beyond your current ability to create from scratch. This will expand the range of what you <em>can</em> create from scratch. Lastly, covers are good for readers, too: they provide new vantage points on the underlying ideas. Reading multiple versions of a text is like seeing its underlying ideas with binocular vision.</p>

<p>Covers exist in other domains too: scientists reproduce other scientistsâ€™ experiments; chefs reproduce other chefsâ€™ recipes; painters reproduce other paintersâ€™ paintings. If youâ€™re a writer, why not try your hand at reproducing another writerâ€™s work? Iâ€™ve been doing this for the past few months. Here are a few examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a id="deep-laziness" href="https://davidklaing.com/deep-laziness/">Deep Laziness â€” Sarah Perry</a></li>
  <li><a id="solved-conversations" href="https://davidklaing.com/solved-conversations/">Solved conversations â€” Aaron Z. Lewis</a></li>
  <li><a id="research-as-a-stochastic-decision-process" href="https://davidklaing.com/research-as-a-stochastic-decision-process/">Research as a stochastic decision process â€” Jacob Steinhardt</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Itâ€™s been great exercise for my writing muscles, and I now have enough â€œoriginalâ€�<sup>2</sup> ideas to last me several blog posts. Even if those ideas run dry, I donâ€™t have to worry about writerâ€™s block. If my own ideas arenâ€™t flowing, I can just cover someone elseâ€™s.</p>

<hr>

<p>1. There is another whole category of examples that exist almost by luck: translations. If it werenâ€™t for the fact that many of the greatest works of literature were composed in languages other than our own, we might not get to enjoy them as much as we do. Nobody would be iterating on the language. A few notable examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23198296-beowulf">Beowulf</a>, translated by none other than J.R.R. Tolkien.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39800574-ursula-k-le-guin-yorumuyla-tao-te-ching">The Tao Te Ching</a>, translated by Ursula K. Le Guin, the renowned science fiction writer.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20518872-the-three-body-problem">The Three-Body Problem</a>, translated by Ken Liu. It is <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/10/wired-book-club-ken-liu-interview/">potentially even better</a> in English than in Liu Cixinâ€™s original Chinese.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34068470-the-odyssey">The Odyssey</a>, translated by Emily Wilson. <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2018/11/best-book-2018.html">Says</a> Tyler Cowen, â€œIt is a joy to read, the best of the five translations I know, and it has received <a href="https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&amp;ei=uyf5W6KdI87QrgS54pnQBQ&amp;q=emily+wilson+homer+review&amp;btnK=Google+Search&amp;oq=emily+wilson+homer+review&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...66238.70838..71982...0.0..0.0.0.......0....1..gws-wiz.....0.">strong reviews</a> from scholars for its accuracy and fidelity.â€�</li>
</ul>

<p>2. As Veerasamy pointed out to me when I asked him about his cover of Orwell, even original creations are really just â€œassemblages of micro-coversâ€� anyway. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJPERZDfyWc">Everything is a Remix</a>.</p>

  <p>At the beginning of the COVID crisis, the governor of New Jersey <a href="https://www.govtech.com/computing/As-Unemployment-Claims-Spike-New-Jersey-Seeks-COBOL-Coders.html">called for COBOL developers</a> to help the state fix its unemployment insurance systems. The systems were crashing under overwhelming demand, and the culprit seemed to be the decades-old code underpinning the application for benefits. Predictably, critics jumped all over the government for continuing to operate vital systems using a programming language invented more than 50 years ago.</p>

<p>News flash: the C programming language is the <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">most popular language</a> in the world and it’s nearly as old as COBOL. SQL is the backbone of database programming, and it was invented in the 1970s. The age of a technology is no indicator of its viability or appropriateness for solving mission-critical problems. The fact that something is old may just mean that it has stood the test of time.</p>

<p>As it turns out, New Jersey ultimately didn’t hire any COBOL developers because <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cant-file-unemployment-dont-blame-cobol/">the problem wasn’t really COBOL</a>, it was actually something more quotidian and less dramatic: the ability to process forms on the internet in a way that scales. The problem New Jersey and other governments have isn’t that they’re using old code or older programming languages. The problem is often that they’re using <strong>code that wasn’t designed to meet the needs of people who use it.</strong></p>

<p>The frustrated users of New Jersey’s unemployment insurance system shouldn’t necessarily blame the errors they encountered on COBOL. They ought to blame them on a system architecture that wasn’t built to handle increased demand, or on an interface that was copied directly from a PDF instead of being designed based on intensive testing with users. Blame them on systems that can’t talk to each other behind the scenes, so they keep asking people to re-enter their information. Blame them on a complex authentication process for tasks that can be done without requiring someone to create an account or sign in.</p>

<h2 id="getting-good-at-online-forms">Getting good at online forms</h2>

<p>Governments need to see themselves as digital services providers, which means investing in the product, user experience, and research skills necessary to understand the problems of people using their services, and the software engineering and operations skills that make the services reliable and available at the time of someone’s needs. Simply putting out a procurement for a new software project will not guarantee that it’s easy-to-use or able to stand up during a huge increase in demand, without requiring these specific capabilities from the delivery team.</p>

<p>To start, governments need to develop competency at putting forms on the internet and having them scale to meet demand, while integrating smoothly with backend systems and office processes. This skill is at the core of nearly all modern government digital services, yet many agencies continue to operate online forms that are the door to vital services but can’t compete with the user experience and reliability of common consumer apps.</p>

<p>Creating online forms that are easy for the public to fill out and easy for office staff to process is absolutely within reach for every government agency if they’re willing to follow the best practices of consumer technology in designing and operating these services.
At Ad Hoc, we start by bringing in product management and user research experts to work closely with agencies to investigate the main problem to solve and define the outcomes agencies are seeking. We take in all the constraints of government from privacy to security to accessibility, and balance those with the researched needs of real users, informing agency stakeholders of the tradeoffs and empowering them to make effective choices. We conduct usability research with people who come to government websites looking for services to find out where they get stuck, and what could be done to make the experience better.</p>

<p>Our research team also spends time with the civil servants who process incoming requests from the public to see where the bottlenecks are in their process and how we can ensure any new public-facing application integrates with their backend systems. That often means we have to integrate new applications with old systems and “old” code like the COBOL in New Jersey’s unemployment insurance system.</p>

<p>User research, both at the beginning of a project and throughout development, informs how our product managers set “north stars”, or shared visions of a future success, and outcome metrics with the government customer. As our engineers and designers create these new services, they’re always working towards outcomes for real people. We ask, how many people were able to enroll in a benefit? How often did the site go down and deny access to the application? We prioritize outcome-based metrics over how many features we shipped, or how many story points we completed, or whether we’re using the latest technology to get the job done.</p>

<h2 id="choose-whats-right-over-whats-old">Choose what’s right over what’s old</h2>

<p>Yes, agencies should evaluate whether their continued investment in COBOL and mainframes makes sense for them in terms of their unique constraints of available budget and technology resources, just as they should continuously examine any system, regardless of its technology stack or the age of particular components, for whether its delivering the outcomes they want within the constraints they have.</p>

<p>Agencies should also fix the errors of the past and invest in new and more efficient technologies. No civil servant should have to print out forms submitted online and re-enter the information into another system. But we must be precise about what needs updating and why, and not be dismissive of technologies merely because of their age.</p>

<p>The so-called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture">von Neumann architecture</a>” describes how nearly every computer on the planet is designed and operates. It dates back to the mid-1940s and is, for all intents and purposes, unchanged to this day. We would hardly blame New Jersey’s woes on von Neumann computers, just as we shouldn’t blame forms crashing on COBOL code just because it’s old.</p>

                    <p>I was using Arduino IDE and C++ to program my IOT devices built around ESP-12E. But, I was in need of a higher level language to easily manage my HTTP requests from the device as a client; or, create a small web server in the device itself. I found that using Arduino C++ was a bit hard to deal with that. I liked the idea of using Python in ESP8266 so decided to install MicroPython firmware on ESP8266 E-12.</p>
<p>I am using Python 3.7 but Python 2.7 should also work (according to documentation in MicroPython but I haven't tested it)</p>
<p>For the Hello World application we will not to build any electronic circuit as we're using built-in LED. But I assume your ESP-12E is soldered and connected to an FTDI interface.</p>

<h3 id="installingsteps">Installing steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Install Python if not already installed</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Install pip3</strong> (or pip if you're on Python 2.7)<br>
<a target="_blank" href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/">https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Install esptool</strong><br>
pip3 install esptool</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Download MicroPython firmware</strong><br>
<a href="http://micropython.org/resources/firmware/esp8266-20180511-v1.9.4.bin">http://micropython.org/resources/firmware/esp8266-20180511-v1.9.4.bin</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Erase flash in your ESP8266</strong> (Update your PORT accordingly)<br>
esptool.py --port PORT3 erase_flash</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flash new firmware</strong><br>
esptool.py --port PORT3 --baud 115200 write_flash -fm dio 0x00000 esp8266-20180511-v1.9.4.bin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If step above doesn't work try changing baud rate</strong> (to 57600 or something else)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Install ampy</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/adafruit/ampy" target="_blank">Check their website</a>)<br>
pip3 install adafruit-ampy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Upload the blink example using ampy</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Name below file as "main.py"</p>
<pre><code>import machine
import time
led = machine.Pin(2, machine.Pin.OUT)
led.off()
time.sleep(1)
led.on()
time.sleep(1)
led.off()

</code></pre>
<p>and upload using ampy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ampy -d 1 --port /dev/cu.wchusbserial1420 -b 115200 ls</p>

        # By splitting this into 2 reads, it allows boot.py to print stuff,
        # which will show up after the soft reboot and before the raw REPL.
        # Modification from original pyboard.py below:
        #   Add a small delay and send Ctrl-C twice after soft reboot to ensure
        #   any main program loop in main.py is interrupted.

            raise PyboardError('could not enter raw repl')
</code></pre>
<p>After this change I was able to run the command:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ampy --port /dev/cu.wchusbserial1420 ls</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I can upload the file that I have written in step 9. Let's name this file as "main.py" and upload to ESP8266</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ampy --port /dev/cu.wchusbserial1420 put main.py</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to execute Python commands while connected to ESP8266 as if you were typing commands in IDLE, you can easily setup a serial connection with ESP8266.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>screen /dev/cu.wchusbserial1420 115200</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://cuneyt.aliustaoglu.biz/en/content/images/2018/08/screen.gif" alt="screen"></p>
<p>Now that we managed to install our first ever Python application for ESP8266 we're ready to build much more complicated application with the power of Python.</p>

July 10, 2020 | http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2OKF | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2OKF">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">

<p>7th January 2020</p>
<p>This is the latest in my series of minimalist watches using 12 LEDs, arranged like a clock face, to show the time analogue-style. This one takes advantage of the fact that Microchip's new 1-series ATtiny microcontrollers incorporate a real-time clock, which can be run from an external crystal to keep accurate time while the main processor is put to sleep:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/megatimewatch.jpg" alt="MegaTimeWatch.jpg" width="500" height="432"></p>
<p><em>The Mega Tiny Time watch based on an ATtiny414; it's ten to two.</em></p>
<p>To show the time you press the button on the watch face, and it lights up LEDs to show the time like the hour and minute hands on a clock. The LEDs flash to distinguish the hours and minutes, and show intermediate times. The watch keeps time to within a few seconds a month, while giving a battery life of several years.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>My earlier&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?1MG3">Tiny Time 2 Watch</a>&nbsp;used Maxim Integrated's DS2417 RTC chip to keep time while the processor was put to sleep, to save power. Since I designed that, Microchip have released their 1-series ATtiny chips that incorporate a crystal-controlled real-time clock; this can keep time while the processor is asleep, avoiding the need for a separate RTC chip. Spence Konde calls these the "Mega Tiny" range; hence the name of this watch.</p>
<p>I based this watch on the 14-pin ATtiny414, which has 4K bytes of flash memory, and has an RTC peripheral that supports an external crystal. In this design there are a few I/O pins spare, so you could extend the watch with other features; see <a href="#further-suggestions">Further suggestions</a> below.</p>
<p>As with my earlier watch, to show the time you press the button on the watch face, and the time is then displayed for five seconds. It lights one LED to show the hour, and flashes one or two other LEDs to show the minutes to the nearest minute by altering the rate at which each of the LEDs flash. Here are some examples:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/watchexamples.gif" alt="WatchExamples.gif" width="527" height="206"></p>
<p><em>Examples of how the Mega Tiny Time watch displays the time.</em></p>
<p>For consistency with analogue watches, the Tiny Time Watch displays times later than half past the hour by lighting the next hour number. If only one LED lights up you know that both hands are pointing to the same hour mark.</p>
<p>The total power consumption with no display is just 1µA, giving an estimated battery life of over 10 years from a single CR2016 battery! Obviously this is reduced if you check the time frequently.</p>
<h3>The circuit</h3>
<p>Here's the circuit of the Tiny Time 2 watch, laid out like the circuit board:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/watchtinymega.gif" alt="WatchTinyMega.gif" width="642" height="547"></p>
<p><em>Circuit of the ATtiny414-based Mega Tiny Time watch.</em></p>
<p>The crystal is a standard&nbsp;32.768 kHz quartz watch crystal; I chose a MS1V-T1K micro crystal&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref1"><a href="#cite_note1">[1]</a></sup>, but I expect any&nbsp;32.768 kHz&nbsp;crystal would be suitable. A 3.2 X 1.5 mm SMD crystal would also fit across the pads on the PCB.</p>
<p>The LEDs are 0805 size, and for this version of the watch I chose white LEDs to contrast with the black circuit board. I got mine from Bright Components in the UK, who sell them for under £1 for ten&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref2"><a href="#cite_note2">[2]</a></sup>. Any colour LED should be fine, but they should all be the same colour.</p>
<p>I arranged the LEDs to simplify the PCB layout which explains the rather haphazard order, but this is easily accommodated by an array in the software. The following table shows which LED lights up when you take one I/O line high and the other I/O line low:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/watch3leds.gif" alt="Watch3LEDs.gif" width="243" height="167"></p>
<p>The button is a miniature SMD push button available from Sparkfun <sup id="cite_ref3"><a href="#cite_note3">[3]</a></sup>, available from Proto-PIC in the UK <sup id="cite_ref4"><a href="#cite_note4">[4]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The battery is a 20mm coin cell. Given the low current consumption I decided to use the slimmer CR2016 cell, and found a suitable SMD battery holder on Mouser <sup id="cite_ref5"><a href="#cite_note5">[5]</a></sup>. Alternatively you could use a CR2032 battery, with an SMD 20mm coin cell holder available from Sparkfun <sup id="cite_ref6"><a href="#cite_note6">[6]</a></sup>, or from Proto-PIC in the UK <sup id="cite_ref7"><a href="#cite_note7">[7]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>NOTE: If a child could play with this watch please bend the tabs on the coin cell holder, or glue in the coin cell, so the cell can't be removed and swallowed.</p>
<h4>â–º Parts list</h4>

<h3>Construction</h3>
<p>I designed the board in Eagle and sent it to PCBWay for fabrication.&nbsp;Here's the layout (from the OSH Park preview):</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/megatinytimewatchpcb.gif" alt="MegaTinyTimeWatchPCB.gif" width="441" height="250"></p>
<p>See the end of the article for links to download the board files or order a board.</p>
<p>I built the watch using SMD components, with all the components apart from the battery holder soldered to the front of the board. The ATtiny414 was SOIC, and I used 0805 resistors and LEDs, so they should be relatively easy to solder by hand:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/megatinytimefront.jpg" alt="MegaTinyTimeFront.jpg" width="290" height="330"><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/megatinytimeback.jpg" alt="MegaTinyTimeBack.jpg" width="290" height="330"></p>
<p><em>The front and back of the completed Mega Tiny Time watch circuit board.</em></p>
<p>The LEDs should all be soldered with the same orientation, with the negative sides facing the centre of the board.</p>
<p>I used a Youyue 858D+ hot air gun at 250°C to solder the SMD components onto the front of the board, and then finally soldered the battery holder onto the back of the board using a conventional soldering iron. If you don't have a hot air gun you should be able to solder the SMD components with a bit of care using a fine-tipped soldering iron.</p>
<p>I found a suitable 12mm wide thread-through watch strap from a German supplier <sup id="cite_ref8"><a href="#cite_note8">[8]</a></sup>.</p>
<h3>The program</h3>
<p>This section explains the various sections of the Tiny Time Watch program.</p>
<h4>Real-Time Clock</h4>
<p>As in my earlier project&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2RA3">New ATtiny Low Power</a>, the aim is to keep the processor asleep most of the time to minimise the watch's power consumption.</p>
<p>From the ATtiny414 datasheet I realised that there were two possible ways to use the 1-series ATtiny Real-Time Clock peripheral in this application. It could run as a Real-Time Counter, keeping a 16-bit count of the number of elapsed seconds in the RTC CNT Count register while the processor stays asleep. Alternatively it could run as a Periodic Interrupt Timer (PIT), generating an interrupt to wake up the processor briefly every second and increment a variable to count the number of seconds.</p>
<p>In theory the CNT approach should give slightly lower power consumption, because the processor only needs to be woken up when you're displaying the time, but I couldn't get it to work; the CNT register didn't seem to get incremented when the processor was asleep. However, the PIT approach worked perfectly, and the difference in power consumption is probably minimal. If I get the CNT method working I'll post it as an update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Setting up the RTC to use an external crystal is more complicated than you might expect, because the Clock Controller is protected from accidental change by Configuration Change Protection (CCP), so before each change you have to enable the action first. Fortunately there's an application note that explains how to do this, and my code is based on one of the examples in that note <sup id="cite_ref9"><a href="#cite_note9">[9]</a></sup>.</p>
<h4>The display</h4>
<p>The 12 LEDs are driven by the four I/O lines PA1, PA4, PPA5, and PA6. The array Pin[6][6] specifies how the LEDs are connected to the five I/O lines:</p>
<pre>int Pins[6][6] = {{ -1, -1, -1,  8,  6,  4 },
                  { -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1 },
                  { -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1 },
                  {  7, -1, -1, -1, 11,  9 },
                  {  0, -1, -1, 10, -1,  2 },
                  {  5, -1, -1,  3,  1, -1 }};</pre>
<p>The first row of the array specifies which LEDs have their cathodes connected to PA1: the LED at 8 o'clock has its anode connected to PA4, the LED at 6 o'clock has its anode connected to PA5, and the LED at 4 o'clock has its anode connected to PA6. The values in the array corresponding to PA2 and PA3 are set to -1, as these aren't connected to any LEDs; it was simpler to use a larger array than write code to compensate for this.</p>
<p>I used Timer/Counter TCB running at 250 Hz to multiplex the display. This is set up by the routine <strong>DisplaySetup()</strong> as follows:</p>
<pre>void DisplaySetup () {
  // Set up Timer/Counter TCB to multiplex the display
  TCB0.CCMP = 19999;                                  // Divide 5MHz by 20000 = 250Hz
  TCB0.CTRLA = TCB_CLKSEL_CLKDIV1_gc | TCB_ENABLE_bm; // Enable timer, divide by 1
  TCB0.CTRLB = 0;                                     // Periodic Interrupt Mode
  TCB0.INTCTRL = TCB_CAPT_bm;                         // Enable interrupt
}</pre>
<p>The interrupt service routine simply calls <strong>DisplayNextRow()</strong>, decrements the global variable <strong>Timeout,</strong> and increments the global variable <strong>Offset</strong> used when initially setting the time:</p>
<pre>ISR(TCB0_INT_vect) {
  TCB0.INTFLAGS = TCB_CAPT_bm;                        // Clear the interrupt flag
  DisplayNextRow();
  Timeout--;
  Offset++;
}</pre>
<p>Two additional routines are used to turn the display on and off:</p>
<pre>void DisplayOn () {
  // Turn off all the pullups
  PORTA.PIN0CTRL = 0;
  PORTA.PIN1CTRL = 0;
  PORTA.PIN4CTRL = 0;
  PORTA.PIN5CTRL = 0;
  PORTA.PIN6CTRL = 0;
  TCB0.INTCTRL = TCB_CAPT_bm;                         // Enable interrupt
}

void DisplayOff () {
  TCB0.INTCTRL = 0;                                   // Disable interrupt
  PORTA.DIR = 0;                                      // All PORTA pins inputs
  // Turn on all the pullups for minimal power in sleep
  PORTA.PIN0CTRL = PORT_PULLUPEN_bm;                  // UPDI
  PORTA.PIN1CTRL = PORT_PULLUPEN_bm;
  PORTA.PIN4CTRL = PORT_PULLUPEN_bm;
  PORTA.PIN5CTRL = PORT_PULLUPEN_bm;
  PORTA.PIN6CTRL = PORT_PULLUPEN_bm;
}</pre>
<h4>Display multiplexing</h4>
<p>The routine <strong>DisplayNextRow()</strong> works as follows:</p>
<pre>void DisplayNextRow() {
  Cycle++;
  uint8_t row = Cycle &amp; 0x03;
  if (row &gt; 0) row = row + 2;                         // Skip PA2 and PA3
  uint8_t bits = 0;
  for (int i=0; i&lt;6; i++) {
    if (Hours == Pins[row][i]) bits = bits | 1&lt;&lt;(i+1);
    if (Fivemins == Pins[row][i]) bits = bits | 1&lt;&lt;(i+1);
  }
  PORTA.DIR = 1&lt;&lt;(row+1) | bits;                      // Make outputs for lit LED
  PORTA.OUT = bits;                                   // Set outputs high
}
</pre>

<p>Up to two LEDs can be lit at once. The LED specified by the variable <strong>Hours</strong> is used to show the hours, and is displayed continuously. The LED specified by the variable&nbsp;<strong>Fivemins</strong>&nbsp;is used for the minutes.</p>
<p>The bottom two bits of the variable <strong>Cycle</strong> determine which row is being displayed. For a given row the array <strong>Pins[row][i]</strong> is checked to see if any of the LEDs in that row need to be displayed. If so, the appropriate bits are set in the variable <strong>bits</strong>. This is then written to the port.</p>
<p>To test the the LEDs you can run the following&nbsp;<strong>loop()</strong> function instead of …</p></div></div>

</a></p><p>By John Lekberg on July 09, 2020.
</p><hr>
<p>This week's blog post is about solving the "Plus-Minus"
problem in <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>.
You will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search">brute force
solution</a> using the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html">itertools</a> and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html">operator</a> modules.</li>
<li>How to create a more efficient solution by noticing hidden structure within
the problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>You are given a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number">positive number</a>
<var>n</var>.
Your goal is to find a way to add and subtract the numbers
from 1 to <var>n</var> to make 0.</p>
<p>E.g. <var>n</var> = 4 and a solution is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>0 = 1 - 2 - 3 + 4</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a given <var>n</var> it may be impossible to find a
solution.</p>

<p>I represent the solution as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number">list</a> of the numbers 1 to
<var>n</var>, each number being positive or negative (to represent addition or
subtraction).
E.g. the solution "1 - 2 - 3 + 4" is represented as</p>
<pre><code>[1, -2, -3, 4]
</code></pre>
<p>If a solution cannot be found, I use the value
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#the-standard-type-hierarchy">None</a>.</p>

<p>A simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search">brute force solution</a> will attempt every
possible way to add and subtract the numbers.
Here's a Python function that does that:</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import product
from operator import pos, neg


def plus_minus_bf(*, n):
    """Solve the 'Plus Minus' problem using brute force."""
    assert n &gt; 0
    unsigned_nums = range(1, n + 1)
    for signs in product([pos, neg], repeat=n):
        signed_nums = [
            sign(num)
            for sign, num in zip(signs, unsigned_nums)
        ]
        if sum(signed_nums) == 0:
            return signed_nums
</code></pre>
<p>This code starts with a range of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signedness">unsigned
numbers</a> and "signs" the numbers by
using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#operator.pos">operator.pos</a> and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#operator.neg">operator.neg</a>.
The code uses
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.product">itertools.product</a>
to generate all possible ways to mark the numbers in <code>unsigned_nums</code> as
positive (being added) or negative (being subtracted).
Here are solutions for <var>n</var> = 1 to <var>n</var> = 10.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>print("n   Solution")
print("--  --------")
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(f"{i:2}  {plus_minus_bf(n=i)}")
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>n   Solution
--  --------
 1  None
 2  None
 3  [1, 2, -3]
 4  [1, -2, -3, 4]
 5  None
 6  None
 7  [1, 2, -3, 4, -5, -6, 7]
 8  [1, 2, 3, 4, -5, -6, -7, 8]
 9  None
10  None
</code></pre>
<p>What's the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time complexity</a> of
this function?
For a positive integer <var>n</var>:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are 2<sup><var>n</var></sup> ways to add and
subtract the numbers 1 to <var>n</var>.</li>
<li>Signing the unsigned numbers and checking that the signed
numbers sum to 0 takes O(<var>n</var>) operations, because
the list of <var>n</var> numbers is looped over.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, the overall time complexity of the function is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O(<var>n</var> 2<sup><var>n</var></sup>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To create a more efficient solution, I look more closely at
the structure of the problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I have the numbers 1 to <var>n</var>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider any 4 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_sequence">consecutive</a> numbers</p>
<blockquote>
<p><var>i</var>, <var>i</var>+1, <var>i</var>+2,
<var>i</var>+3</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's true that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(<var>i</var>) - (<var>i</var>+1) - (<var>i</var>+2) +
(<var>i</var>+3) = 0</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I call this <strong>the pattern.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, I can solve the problem if
<var>n</var>Â&nbsp;=Â&nbsp;4<var>k</var>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Repeat <strong>the pattern</strong> <var>k</var> times to cover all the
numbers from 1 to <var>n</var>.</li>
<li>The additions and subtractions will total to 0.</li>
</ul>
<p>And I can solve the problem if <var>n</var>Â&nbsp;=Â&nbsp;4<var>k</var>+3:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Start with</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-1 - 2 + 3 ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(This totals to 0.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeat <strong>the pattern</strong> <var>k</var> times to cover all the
numbers from 1 to <var>n</var>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The additions and subtractions will total to 0.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But, what if <var>n</var>Â&nbsp;=Â&nbsp;4<var>k</var>+1 or
<var>n</var>Â&nbsp;=Â&nbsp;4<var>k</var>+2?
There is no solution.
Here's why:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For a given <var>n</var>, I want to divide the numbers 1
to <var>n</var> into two
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)">sets</a>, the pluses
<var>P</var> and the minuses <var>M</var>, so that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sum(<var>P</var>) - sum(<var>M</var>) = 0</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>This means that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sum(<var>P</var>) + sum(<var>M</var>) = 2
sum(<var>M</var>)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sum(<var>P</var>) + sum(<var>M</var>) is even</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>The numbers 1 to <var>n</var> are divided between
<var>P</var> and <var>M</var>, so</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sum(<var>P</var>) + sum(<var>M</var>) = 1 + 2 + ... +
<var>n</var></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>This sum is called the <var>n</var>-th <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number">triangular
number</a> and has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-form_expression">closed
form expression</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 + 2 + ... + <var>n</var> = <var>n</var>(<var>n</var> +
1)/2</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sum(<var>P</var>) + sum(<var>M</var>) =
<var>n</var>(<var>n</var> + 1)/2</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sum(<var>P</var>) + sum(<var>M</var>) is even</p>
</blockquote>
<p>then</p>
<blockquote>
<p><var>n</var>(<var>n</var> + 1)/2 must be even</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><var>n</var>(<var>n</var> + 1)/2 must be divisible by 2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This implies that</p>
<blockquote>
<p><var>n</var>(<var>n</var> + 1) must be divisible by 4</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><var>n</var> or <var>n</var> + 1 is divisible by 4</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this is only true when</p>
<blockquote>
<p><var>n</var> = 4<var>k</var></p>
</blockquote>
<p>or when</p>
<blockquote>
<p><var>n</var> = 4<var>k</var> + 3</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>This means that there is no solution when</p>
<blockquote>
<p><var>n</var> = 4<var>k</var> + 1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or when</p>
<blockquote>
<p><var>n</var> = 4<var>k</var> + 2</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a Python function that implements this faster
algorithm:</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import cycle, chain
from operator import pos, neg


def plus_minus_fast(*, n):
    """Efficiently solve the 'Plus Minus' problem."""
    assert n &gt; 0

    rem = n % 4
    if rem == 1 or rem == 2:
        return None

    pattern = [pos, neg, neg, pos]
    if rem == 0:
        signs = cycle(pattern)
    elif rem == 3:
        signs = chain([neg, neg, pos], cycle(pattern))

    unsigned_nums = range(1, n + 1)
    signed_nums = [
        sign(num) for sign, num in zip(signs, unsigned_nums)
    ]
    return signed_nums
</code></pre>
<p>This code uses
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.cycle">itertools.cycle</a>
and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.chain">itertools.chain</a>
to construct the sequence of signs.
<code>cycle()</code> actually creates an infinite <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Iterator">iterator</a>, but this
isn't a problem because <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip">zip</a> truncates the iterator to
the length of <code>unsigned_nums</code>.</p>
<p>Here are solutions for <var>n</var> = 1 to <var>n</var> = 10.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>print("n   Solution")
print("--  --------")
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(f"{i:2}  {plus_minus_fast(n=i)}")
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>n   Solution
--  --------
 1  None
 2  None
 3  [-1, -2, 3]
 4  [1, -2, -3, 4]
 5  None
 6  None
 7  [-1, -2, 3, 4, -5, -6, 7]
 8  [1, -2, -3, 4, 5, -6, -7, 8]
 9  None
10  None
</code></pre>
<p>What's the time complexity of this algorithm?
For a positive integer <var>n</var>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <var>n</var>Â&nbsp;=Â&nbsp;4<var>k</var>+1 or
<var>n</var>Â&nbsp;=Â&nbsp;4<var>k</var>+2, then the function
immediately returns, taking O(1) steps.</li>
<li>Otherwise, <var>n</var>Â&nbsp;=Â&nbsp;4<var>k</var> or
<var>n</var>Â&nbsp;=Â&nbsp;4<var>k</var>+3.

You learned how to create a brute force solution using the itertools and
operator modules.
And you learned how to create a more efficient solution by noticing hidden
structure in the problem.</p>
<p>My challenge to you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are given positive numbers <var>n</var> and <var>m</var>.
Write a program that finds a way to add and subtract the numbers from 1 to
<var>n</var> to make <var>m</var>.</p>

				<p>This is a short guide describing the latency implications of the virtual memory
abstraction. If you are building systems requiring low and predictable latency
such as realtime audio processing, control and high frequency trading (HFT) /
algorithmic trading systems this guide will be useful to you. It is written from
the perspective Linux kernel running on AMD64 / x86-64 architecture, but the
general concepts applies to most operating systems and CPU architectures.</p>
<p>In summary to minimize latency introduced by the virtual memory abstraction you
should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimize page faults by pre-faulting, locking and pre-allocating needed
memory. Disable swap.</li>
<li>Reduce TLB misses by minimizing your working set memory and utilizing huge
pages.</li>
<li>Prevent TLB shootdowns by not modifying your programs page tables after
startup.</li>
<li>Prevent stalls due to page cache writeback by not creating file backed
writable memory mappings.</li>
<li>Disable Linux transparent huge pages (THP) background defragmentation.</li>
<li>Disable Linux kernel samepage merging (KSM).</li>
<li>Disable Linux automatic NUMA balancing.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="page-faults">Page faults</h2>
<p>When reading or writing to file backed memory that is not in the <em>page
cache</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> or to <em>anonymous memory</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> that has been swapped out,
the kernel must first load the data from the underlying storage device. This is
called a major page fault and incurs a similar overhead as issuing a <code>read</code> or
<code>write</code> system call.</p>
<p>If the page is already in the page cache you will still incur a minor page fault
on first access after calling <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html"><code>mmap</code></a>, during which the page table is
updated to point to the correct page. For anonymous memory there will also be a
minor page fault on first write access, when a anonymous page is allocated,
zeroed and the page table updated<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Basically memory mappings are lazily
initialized on first use. Note also that access to the page table during a page
fault is protected by locks leading to scalability issues in multi-threaded
applications<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>To avoid page faults you can pre-fault and disable page cache eviction of the
needed memory using the <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mlock.2.html"><code>mlock</code></a> system call or the <code>MAP_LOCKED</code> and
<code>MAP_POPULATE</code> flags to <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html"><code>mmap</code></a>. You can also disable swap system wide to
prevent anonymous memory from being swapped to disk.</p>
<p>You can monitor number of page faults using</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">ps -eo min_flt,maj_flt,cmd
</code></pre><p>or</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">perf stat -e faults,minor-faults,major-faults
</code></pre><h2 id="tlb-misses">TLB misses</h2>
<p>The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_lookaside_buffer">translation lookaside buffer (TLB)</a>
is a on CPU cache that maps virtual to physical addresses. These mappings are
maintained for pages typically of size 4 KiB, 2/4 MiB or 1 GiB. Usually there
are separate TLBs for data (DTLB) and instructions (ITLB) with a shared second
level TLB (STLB)<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. The TLB has a limited number of entries and if a
address is not found in the TLB or STLB, the page table data in the CPU caches
or main memory needs to be referenced, this is called a TLB miss. The same as a
CPU cache miss is more expensive than a cache hit, a TLB miss is more expensive
than a TLB hit.</p>
<p>You can minimize TLB misses by reducing your working set size, making sure to
pack your data into as few pages as possible. Additionally you can utilize
larger page sizes than the default 4 KiB. These larger pages are called <em>huge
pages</em><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> and allows you to reference more data using fewer pages.</p>
<p>TLB usage can be monitored using:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">perf stat -e dTLB-loads,dTLB-load-misses,iTLB-loads,iTLB-load-misses
</code></pre><h2 id="tlb-shootdowns">TLB shootdowns</h2>
<p>Most processors do not provide coherence guarantees for TLB mappings. Instead
the kernel provides this guarantee using a mechanism called <em>TLB shootdown</em>. It
operates by sending inter-processor interrupts (IPIs) that runs kernel code to
invalidate the stale TLB entries<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. <em>TLB shootdowns</em> causes each affected
core to context switch into the kernel and thus causes latency spikes for the
process running on the affected cores. It will also cause TLB misses when a
address with an invalidated page table entry is subsequently accessed.</p>
<p>Any operation that narrows a process’ access to memory like <code>munmap</code> and
<code>mprotect</code> will cause a TLB shootdown. Calls to the C standard library allocator
(<code>malloc</code>, <code>free</code>, etc) will call <code>madvise(...MADV_FREE)</code>/<code>munmap</code> internally,
but not necessarily on each invocation. TLB shootdowns will also occur during
page cache writeback.</p>
<p>To avoid TLB shootdowns you can map all needed memory at program startup and
avoid calling any functions that modifies the page table after that. The
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc">mimalloc allocator</a> can be tuned to
allocate huge pages at program startup (<code>MIMALLOC_RESERVE_HUGE_OS_PAGES=N</code>) and
never return memory to the OS (<code>MIMALLOC_PAGE_RESET=0</code>).</p>
<p>You can monitor the number of TLB shootdowns in <code>/proc/interrupts</code>.</p>
<h2 id="page-cache-writeback">Page cache writeback</h2>
<p>When a page in the <em>page cache</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> has been modified it is marked as
dirty and needs to be eventually written back to disk. This process is called
writeback and is triggered automatically on a timer or when specifically
requested using the system calls <code>fsync</code>, <code>fdatasync</code>, <code>sync</code>, <code>syncfs</code>,
<code>msync</code>, and others. If any of the dirty pages are part of a writable memory
mapping, the writeback process must first update the page table to mark the page
as read-only before writing it to disk. Any subsequent memory write to the page
will cause a page fault, letting the kernel update the page cache state to dirty
and mark the page writable again. In practice this means that writeback causes
TLB shootdowns and that writes to pages that are currently being written to disk
must stall until the disk write is complete. This leads to latency spikes for
any process that is using <em>file backed writable memory mappings</em>.</p>
<p>To avoid latency spikes due to <em>page cache writeback</em> you cannot create any file
backed writable memory mappings. Creating anonymous writable memory mappings
using <code>mmap(...MAP_ANONYMOUS)</code> or by mapping files on
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/tmpfs.html">Linux <em>tmpfs</em> filesystem</a>
is fine.</p>
<p>I wrote a <a href="https://rigtorp.se/writeback.cpp">small program to demonstrate this effect</a>.</p>
<h2 id="transparent-hugepages">Transparent hugepages</h2>
<p>On
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/mm/transhuge.html">Linux <em>transparent huge page</em> (THP) support</a>
should cause TLB shootdowns when memory regions are compacted / defragmented,
but I have not verified that.</p>
<p>THP can be beneficial for reducing TLB misses, but you should disable
<em>khugepaged</em> background defragmentation to avoid any latency spikes due to the
defragmentation process:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">echo 0 &gt;/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/khugepaged/defrag
</code></pre><p>There is some ongoing work to support THP for excutables:
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/789159/">https://lwn.net/Articles/789159/</a></p>
<h2 id="kernel-samepage-merging">Kernel samepage merging</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/mm/ksm.html">Linux kernel samepage merging (KSM)</a>
is a feature that can de-duplicate pages with identical data. The merging
process will lead to TLB shootdowns and unpredictable memory access latencies.</p>
<p>Make sure kernel samepage merging (KSM) is disabled.</p>
<h2 id="numa-and-page-migration">NUMA and Page migration</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/vm/numa.html">Non-uniform memory access (NUMA)</a> occurs when the memory access time
varies with memory location and processor core. You need to take this into
account when designing your system.</p>
<p>On Linux you can use <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v1/cpusets.html">cpusets</a>, <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/numactl.8.html"><code>numactl</code></a>,
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/set_mempolicy.2.html"><code>set_mempolicy</code></a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mbind.2.html"><code>mbind</code></a> to control the NUMA node
memory placement policy.</p>
<p>Additionally Linux supports
<a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/virtualization_tuning_and_optimization_guide/sect-virtualization_tuning_optimization_guide-numa-auto_numa_balancing">automatic migration of memory between NUMA nodes</a>.
The automatic NUMA balancing will cause page faults and TLB shootdowns and
should be disabled:</p>

<p>“The physical memory is volatile and the common case for getting data into
the memory is to read it from files. Whenever a file is read, the data is
put into the page cache to avoid expensive disk access on the subsequent
reads. Similarly, when one writes to a file, the data is placed in the page
cache and eventually gets into the backing storage device. The written pages
are marked as dirty and when Linux decides to reuse them for other purposes,
it makes sure to synchronize the file contents on the device with the
updated data.”

<p>“The anonymous memory or anonymous mappings represent memory that is not
backed by a filesystem. Such mappings are implicitly created for program’s
stack and heap or by explicit calls to mmap(2) system call. Usually, the
anonymous mappings only define virtual memory areas that the program is
allowed to access. The read accesses will result in creation of a page table
entry that references a special physical page filled with zeroes. When the
program performs a write, a regular physical page will be allocated to hold
the written data. The page will be marked dirty and if the kernel decides to
repurpose it, the dirty page will be swapped out.”

    <h2>Product Description</h2>
<p>The CDATA OLTs are OEM FTTH OLTs, sold under different brands (Cdata, OptiLink, V-SOL CN, BLIY), allowing to provide FTTH connectivity to a large number of clients (using ONTs).
Some of the devices support multiple 10-gigabit uplinks and provide Internet connectivity to up to 1024 ONTs (clients).</p>
<p>We validated the vulnerabilities against FD1104B and FD1108SN OLTs in our lab environment with the latest firmware versions (V1.2.2 and 2.4.05_000, 2.4.04_001 and 2.4.03_000).
<img alt="" src="https://pierrekim.github.io/blog/images/2020-olt.jpg"></p>
<p>Using static analysis, these vulnerabilities also appear to affect all available OLT models as the codebase is similar:</p>
<ul>
<li>72408A</li>
<li>9008A</li>
<li>9016A</li>

<h2>Details - Backdoor Access with telnet</h2>
<p>A telnet server is running in the appliance and is reachable from the WAN interface and from the FTTH LAN interface (from the ONTs).</p>
<p>Depending on the firmware, the backdoor credentials may change. You can find below a complete list of backdoor (undocumented) credentials, giving an attacker a complete administrator CLI access.</p>
<p>Previous and old versions can be abused with:</p>
<pre><code>login: suma123
password: panger123
</code></pre>
<p>New recent versions can be abused with:</p>
<pre><code>login: debug
password: debug124

login: root
password: root126

login: guest
password: [empty]
</code></pre>
<p><img alt="" src="https://pierrekim.github.io/blog/images/2020-olt-sub_7740A4.png">
</p><center>Authentication process with hardcoded credentials</center>
<p>The credentials have been extracted from old and new firmware images.</p>
<p>About the credentials, it depends on the vendors and the version of the firmware - the appearance of the CLI may be different but the access still works.</p>

<p><em>Sometimes you’re bored on a Friday night. Sometimes you think of data visualization on a Friday night. Sometimes you think of (or, better yet, eat) dumplings on a Friday night.</em> <em>And sometimes, you do all of the above.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="dumplings">

<p>I am a fan of dumplings. Bread-type foods are awesome. Filled foods are awesome. Filled bread is awesome (if you’ve never had a Georgian <em>lobiani</em>, you’re missing out!). A dumpling, though not necessarily having to be filled, combines a lot of this. In <em>my</em> world, a dumpling is normally cooked in some liquid though – that is, boiled, simmered, steamed, or deep-fried, rather than, say, baked. We’ll come back to this.</p>
<p>I work as a researcher in linguistics, and I’m interested in comparing different languages. How are they similar and how are they different? Sometimes, I use multidimensional scaling (MDS) as a way of comparing such similarities or differences. Anyway, on this particular Friday night (August 23rd, 2019), I saw a <a href="https://twitter.com/Laserhedvig/status/1164794499324772354">Twitter post</a> mentioning a “dumpling party” (omg, that in itself = love), at which one person had brought Italian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arancini"><em>arancini</em></a>, which received “mixed reception” by the other guests. So I started thinking, <em>what defines a “dumpling”, and can you group them based on various features</em>. Turns out <a href="https://twitter.com/emilymbender">Emily Bender et al.</a> had already established a definition of <em>dumpling</em> at their website promoting the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/idop-idod/idod"><em>International Day of Dumplings</em></a> – I did not know of this as of this particular Friday night.</p>
<p>At this point, I thought <em>what if I just look up some dumplings on Wikipedia, and code some of the specific features for each one?</em> This could allow me to plot them in two-dimensional space using MDS methods. I was intrigued by the possible outcome, so I started reading through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumpling">Wikipedia article “Dumpling”</a>…</p>
</div>
<div id="sampling">

<p>My method wasn’t very sophisticated. I started by scrolling through the Wikipedia article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumpling">Dumpling</a>, and basically took each item that had its own article (I may have missed a few), transferred it to a spreadsheet, and started adding some columns for particular features. As I started getting more items, the number of features grew, and I have to be honest, they are far from perfect and just things that I thought of on the spot. A <em>much better</em> analysis could easily be done with a bit more sophistication, time, and systematicity. I mean, this was after all just a random Friday night and I was already past my bed time…</p>
<p>In the end, I collected data from 61 different dumplings. Note that when I say different, this categorization is not at all well-defined. I tried to exclude duplicates for which even the names themselves were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognate"><em>cognates</em></a>. Chinese <em>jiǎozi (餃子)</em> is related to Japanese <em>gyōza (ギョーザ)</em> and thus only the former was included. However, in the case of German <em>Knödel</em> and Czech <em>knedlík</em>, I decided to include both simply based on the fact that whereas the former was listed as potentially being served with a sweet filling, I did not observe this with the latter – NB: I promise this wasn’t a biased decision (see the <a href="#bonus">Bonus</a> section).</p>
<p>Beyond the dumplings sampled according to the above criteria, I also included a few items not traditionally seen as dumplings, because I wanted to see how they patterned with the dumplings proper. These items include <em>calzone</em>, <em>bitterballen</em>, and – of course – <em>arancini</em>. The resulting sample of 61 items can be seen below.</p>

<p>The features that I ended up settling on amounted to 15 different ones. Some are related but not mutually exclusive. The concern mainly content, form, and preparation. Some dumplings can be prepared in several ways (e.g., either <em>boiled</em> or <em>steamed</em>) and may be either <em>sweet</em> or <em>savory</em>; others seem to be more strict with regard to some of these features.</p>

<h3>Dumpling features</h3>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Flour</strong>: <em>Is flour (any type) used in the dough?</em></li>
<li><strong>Bread</strong>: <em>Are bread bits or breadcrumbs added?</em></li>
<li><strong>Battered</strong>: <em>Is the dough battered (or itself a batter) before prepared?</em></li>
<li><strong>Starch</strong>: <em>Is any starchy produce added to the dough (e.g., potatoes)</em></li>
<li><strong>Plain</strong>: <em>Does it occur without filling?</em></li>
<li><strong>Filled</strong>: <em>Does it occur with filling?</em></li>
<li><strong>Thick</strong>: <em>Is the doughy coating “thick” (yes, this is quite subjective)</em></li>
<li><strong>Boiled</strong>: <em>Can it be boiled?</em></li>
<li><strong>Steamed</strong>: <em>Can it be steamed?</em></li>
<li><strong>DeepFried</strong>: <em>Can it be deep-fried?</em></li>
<li><strong>Fried</strong>: <em>Can it be fried (e.g., in a pan or a grill)?</em></li>
<li><strong>Baked</strong>: <em>Can it be baked (e.g., in an oven)?</em></li>
<li><strong>Raw</strong>: <em>Can it be served basically as is?</em></li>
<li><strong>Sweet</strong>: <em>Is it sweet?</em></li>
<li><strong>Savory</strong>: <em>Is it savory?</em></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Each dumpling was assigned a binary value (0 or 1) per feature, resulting in the below table – again, not that this was not very serious work on a Friday night and I was tired; errors are to be expected (but feel free to re-work this yourself if you feel like it!).</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>It's been <a href="https://blog.chartmogul.com/firing-customers/">4 months since I wrote a blog post</a>. I've been keeping busy. Today I just feel like I have a lot to say so here's an update about what's on my mind and the challenges I'm working through at this stage in my business.</p><p>Imagine making money while you sleep, never waking up to an alarm clock, and planning out your schedule each week to work on the things that you want to work on. You spend your time reading books, programming, talking with people about their businesses each day, and researching things that you find interesting, not because you need to make money, but just because it's fun.</p><p>This is my life right now. I'm 27 years old and I guess this is what it feels like to be retired? I run a <a href="https://hostifi.net/">small online business</a>, own a small house in a small town in Michigan. I bought it cash a few months ago. No debt, hardly any bills. I live with my fiancee. We've got 10 acres of land, a few dogs. We're taking care of some puppies and kittens right now until we find homes for them. We like to drive around in the woods on ATVs, have huge bonfires, barbecue, swim in our pool, and work on projects around the house. We're living the <a href="https://twitter.com/tylertringas/status/1213183942880153600?s=20">New American Dream</a>™.</p><p>I have more wealth, freedom, and happiness now than I've ever had before.</p><p>I can't really put into words how good it feels, and how grateful I am everyday for all of the people and my customers who helped me get here. Special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/tylertringas">Tyler Tringas</a>, everyone in <a href="https://blog.rchase.com/374k-arr-update/earnestcapital.com">Earnest Capital</a>, my fiancee Emily, and my right-hand man <a href="https://twitter.com/Ersafcr7">Safwan Shaikh</a>.</p><p>The business made over $30,000 in revenue last month, but I'm not upgrading my lifestyle with each uptick. Quite the opposite actually. Having a business really changed my outlook on money.</p><p>The lower I can keep my personal burn rate, the more money I can put into the business, the faster it can grow, the bigger the impact it can have. That results in more interesting things I can then build with the money it makes. The lower my expenses are, the less bad feelings like stress, fear, worry, the longer I can live off of savings if my business revenue dries up for some reason and I need to pivot.</p><p>I just want to be able to keep creating and learning new things, being in control of my life, and not dependent on any one customer or employer.</p><p>I've had my share of lucky breaks along the way. From starting a software service that is following in the success of Ubiquiti's growth, to getting fired from my job which pushed me into the business full-time, being accepted into Earnest Capital, and convincing Safwan Shaikh to quit Ubiquiti to come work for my tiny startup. All of those things were out of my control, and had a really big impact which helped get me to where I'm at.</p><p>But of course it also wasn't all luck. Two and a half years ago, when I started on this journey, I had no idea everything would happen so fast. But I did know it would happen eventually. I built the business very intentionally at each step, with the outcome in mind from the start that it was going to make me more money than I could make at my job as a Security Analyst, take less of my time, and would be both a scalable and sellable asset.</p><p>I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Millionaire-Fastlane-Crack-Wealth-Lifetime/dp/0984358102">The Millionaire Fastlane</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/mjdemarco">M.J. DeMarco</a> which originally taught me about separating time from money with a product or software business. After that I decided to start a SaaS business, and followed closely in the footsteps of the path that Tyler Tringas had blazed with <a href="https://tylertringas.com/storemapper/">Storemapper</a> by reading his <a href="https://tylertringas.com/micro-saas-ebook/">Micro-SaaS Ebook</a>. Later on, I learned what it was going to take to remove myself from the day to day operation of my business by reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Built-Sell-Creating-Business-Without/dp/1591845823">Built to Sell</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Myth-Revisited-Small-Businesses-About/dp/0887307280">The E-Myth Revisited</a>.</p><p>Today I'm at that place that I wanted to get to when I started on the journey. I have a business where I'm not trading my time for money, it's scalable, and although I have no plans to sell it, it is also sellable. It's an asset worth around $1M right now. I work on the business about 40 hours per week usually, but I really only have to work on it an hour a day or less if I want to (and sometimes I do).</p><p>I put that to the test over the last two weeks to see how much I actually am required for anything on a day to day basis. I stopped doing support entirely to see what would happen. This gave me an opportunity to uncover any problems with our processes. </p><p>What can't my support employee Safwan do without me, and how do I fix it so he can do those things? </p><p>I had to do it because I've been busy these last few weeks, focused on Python development. We're building a new website platform and I'm writing scripts for the Laravel backend that Romega Digital has been developing for us. </p><p>In addition to stepping out of managing support, I changed my calendar so I only do sales demos on Tuesdays and Thursdays that way I can have more uninterrupted time to write code.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.rchase.com/content/images/2020/07/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.rchase.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-2.png 600w, https://blog.rchase.com/content/images/2020/07/image-2.png 835w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Normally I log in each day to our ticket system Intercom and I work alongside Safwan. I read everything that goes on, assign tickets to him, leave notes, close tickets. I realized I've been managing too much. I don't actually need to do all of that. He's been working here almost a year now and he knows all the processes inside and out, I don't need to manage every ticket coming through.</p><p>Two weeks ago I told him. I'm not logging into Intercom any more. If there's a ticket that you need my help with, assign it to me and Slack me to remind me to look into it. I'm not answering the support phone any more either, so keep an eye on that and call back on any voicemails that come in.</p><p>He's been totally on his own! Instead of me logging in each day and assigning tickets to him, and closing tickets, it was up to him to keep the ticket queue clean, make notes, and assign tickets to me if needed.</p><p>He did a great job and of course I thought, why didn't I do this sooner? I think I felt I had to always be there to make sure it was being done right, which is probably valid when you hire someone new, but he knows what he's doing now and has for a long time already.</p><p>Whenever a ticket did get escalated to me, and it's been only a couple over the last two weeks, I've made a note of it. There are certain things he doesn't have access to be able to fix for a ticket and I need to work on creating systems where he can get access to those edge case things without needing me.</p><p>The ultimate goal is for me to be able to step away for weeks and nothing bad happen during that time.</p><p>This week I started thinking again about the org chart in the E-Myth Revisited. The book said you should stop thinking about yourself as one person doing everything, and create an org chart for your business, splitting up roles that will someday be filled by actual employees. Write your name on each role for now, and later figure out how to fill each of them.</p><p>Here's my org chart for HostiFi right now:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.rchase.com/content/images/2020/07/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.rchase.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-1.png 600w, https://blog.rchase.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-1.png 1000w, https://blog.rchase.com/content/images/2020/07/image-1.png 1150w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>In the beginning I was doing everything - "CEO", development, marketing, support, sales, and accounting. Last summer I hired Safwan Shaikh to take over the support role. Shortly after that I hired Pilot.com to do our books. Then I hired Romega Digital around November of last year to take over design and most of the development department. They're building a new Laravel website for us. Since then I've been putting &nbsp;my effort into the other roles - "CEO" (managing Romega Digital and Safwan), marketing (social media, podcasts, blog posts), sales (doing demos over Zoom), and some Python development.</p><p>Handing off roles was not easy. I first had to learn them inside and out on my own, and then develop step by step processes for how to handle all the things that come up within that role. <a href="https://blog.rchase.com/growing-my-saas-from-solo-founder-to-1-employee/">I wrote about how I did that for the support role</a>. </p><p>For the development role, I was looking to make a full-time hire for that as well last November, but I ended up hiring Romega Digital because I didn't know enough about that side of the business to be able to create the right processes and I knew I needed help fast. With their help, they've built a strong foundation for our new website and now will be able to teach me how it works. Hopefully soon I'll be able to hire someone full-time once I understand it better. That person will probably need to be senior level to make up for the fact that it's not my strongest area though. I'm hoping to hire one person who can do Laravel, Python, and frontend but it might need to be broken down into two or three different roles with one full-time, one part-time or still outsourced.</p><p>With the accounting role, I'm not an expert there either and don't want to be, I'm happy to outsource that role indefinitely and Pilot.com has been doing a good job with it.</p><p>Sales and marketing are roles that I still need to develop into processes and hand off eventually, but we're growing so fast without a lot of effort there right now that it's just not a priority.</p><p>Well, that's pretty much what it's like being at this stage with the business. I really don't have to work if I don't want to, but of course I'm working any ways because I want to keep growing it. We're sprinting toward $1M ARR and I'm still working on building an awesome, lean team. We're going to need that Laravel developer soon, that will be our next hire.</p><p>Why is $1M ARR the new goal? Obviously it's the next coolest thing after $100K ARR, but lately I've been realizing the importance is more business maturity related than just another number. I've been watching <a href="https://twitter.com/NathanLatka">Nathan Latka</a>'s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOR7Rygw_YY">SaaS Shark Tank</a> episodes and I noticed that the businesses under $500K ARR get offers at lower multiples and are less attractive to buyers. It's because there is too much risk with the business being that it's typically still too dependent on the founder(s).</p><p>With $1M ARR we'll have solid capital to support a minimum viable team to fill all the slots in the org chart comfortably. We need about two developers, two technical support engineers, and a person for sales and marketing, and we're going to need about $1M ARR to support that dream team.</p><p>Maybe we're going to …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<h2>The Rule of Least Power</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Principles.html">1998</a>, Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, coined <em>the Principle of Least Power</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Computer Science in the 1960s to 80s spent a lot of effort making languages which were as powerful as possible. Nowadays we have to appreciate the reasons for picking not the most powerful solution but the least powerful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower.html">2006</a>, The W3C codified the principle as the <em>Rule of Least Power</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is an important tradeoff between the computational power of a language and the ability to determine what a program in that language is doing</p>
<p>Expressing constraints, relationships and processing instructions in less powerful languages increases the flexibility with which information can be reused: the less powerful the language, the more you can do with the data stored in that language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, Berners-Lee chose not to make HTML a bona-fide language on the basis of this rule:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I chose HTML not to be a programming language because I wanted different programs to do different things with it: present it differently, extract tables of contents, index it, and so on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though the Rule of Least Power targeted programming languages themselves, rather than language features, I think the same ideas still apply. The less powerful your code is, the easier it is to reason about.</p>
<h2>Array Functions</h2>
<p>It's therefore interesting that <a href="https://flaviocopes.com/javascript-loops-map-filter-reduce-find/">some</a> people say say that the 'functional' array functions like <code>.filter</code>, <code>.map</code>, and <code>.reduce</code> are <em>powerful</em> compared to their crude for-loop alternatives. I would say the opposite: they are far less powerful, and that's the <em>point</em>.</p>
<p>No doubt, the people calling these functions 'powerful' are probably referring to their power in aggregate (for example being able to call <code>array.map(...).filter(...)</code>), or the power enabled through parallel processing, or the power afforded by assigning callbacks to first-class function variables.</p>
<p>But I want to bring your attention to how the power of these functions when considered individually is in fact low, by design.</p>
<p>Here is a diagram I whipped up that crudely orders the common javascript array functions, going from the most powerful (a for-loop) to the least powerful (<code>.some</code>/<code>.every</code>).</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/EvOGL7B.png" alt=""></p>
<h3>Array Function Recap</h3>
<p>Before explaining what I mean by powerful, here's a quick recap of what the different approaches are actually for:</p>
<ul>
<li>for-loop: iterate through a chunk of code, typically for the sake of creating side effects inside the loop (like appending to an array)</li>
<li><code>.forEach</code>: iterate through each element in an array, and in each iteration do something with that element. Again, typically for the sake of creating a side effect at some point.</li>
</ul>
<p>From here down, side effects are strongly discouraged</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.reduce</code>: from left-to-right, iterate through an array to accumulate some value, potentially initialized explicitly at the start, where in each iteration we take the current array item and return the new value of the accumulator (until we return the final value at the end)</li>
<li><code>.map</code>: for each original item in the array, return a new item as a function of the original item to be placed in the corresponding index of the output array</li>
<li><code>.filter</code>: from left-to-right, for each item in the array, include it in the output array if it satisfies some condition</li>
<li><code>.find</code>: from left-to-right, return the first item in the array satisfying some condition</li>
<li><code>.every</code>: return true if every item in the array satisfies some condition, otherwise return false.</li>
<li><code>.some</code>: return true if any item in the array satisfies some condition, otherwise return false.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>This post is less about explaining what each one does and more about picking which one to use. For a good reference see <a href="https://javascript.info/array-methods">here</a></em></p>
<h3>What Do You Mean By Powerful?</h3>
<p>I'm piggybacking off Tim Berners-Lee's coinage here, but when I say 'powerful', I really mean 'flexible'. As in, <em>how many use cases can this function satisfy?</em> Specifically, I'm defining function A as being more powerful than function B if it can implement function B in its own terms, and do other stuff too that function B can't.*</p>
<p>Which means by my definition (which I'm not claiming to be universal) a for-loop is more powerful than <code>.forEach</code> because you can implement <code>.forEach</code> via a for-loop. For example:</p>
<pre><code>const forEach = (array, callback) =&gt; {
  for (i = 0; i &lt; array.length; i++) {
    callback(array[i])
  }
}

forEach([1,2,3], a =&gt; console.log(a))
&gt; 1
&gt; 2
&gt; 3

[1,2,3].forEach(a =&gt; console.log(a))
&gt; 1
&gt; 2
&gt; 3</code></pre>
<p>So no matter what <code>.forEach</code> can do, a for-loop can do more.</p>
<p>Likewise, <code>.reduce</code> can be implemented with <code>.forEach</code> like so:</p>
<pre><code>const reduce = (array, callback, initialValue) =&gt; {
  let result = initialValue

  array.forEach((item) =&gt; {
    result = callback(result, item)
  })

  return result
}

reduce([1,2,3], (acc, curr) =&gt; acc + curr, 0)
&gt; 6

[1,2,3].reduce((acc, curr) =&gt; acc + curr, 0)
&gt; 6</code></pre>
<p>And so on, and so on, all the way to the bottom:</p>
<pre><code>const some = (array, callback) =&gt; array.find(callback) !== undefined</code></pre>
<p>Notably, our custom <code>some</code> doesn't handle undefined values as well as the ECMASCript one, but you get the idea.</p>
<h3>Choose the Least Powerful Function</h3>
<p>Why not just use a for-loop for everything? That way we only need to remember one approach to iterating through an array's items. The reason is the same reason you don't use a grenade to kill a mosquito: grenades are illegal and black market goods are marked up to subsidise the risk taken on by the vendor.</p>
<p>For real though: there are various reasons to pick the least powerful tool, but to me the two most important reasons are:<br>
1) reducing the chance of errors<br>
2) easy comprehension by others</p>
<h4>Reducing the chance of errors</h4>
<p>The least powerful tool for the job that can <em>still do the job</em> is the one that leaves the least chance for errors. Consider the situation where I have an array of numbers and I want to return the result of doubling each item in the array:</p>
<pre><code>const myArray = [1,2,3]

// with `.map`
resultWithMap = myArray.map(item =&gt; item * 2)
&gt; [2,4,6]

// with a for-loop
let resultWithLoop = []
for (i = 0; i &lt; myArray.length-1; i++) {
  resultWithLoop.push(array[i] * 2)
}
resultWithLoop
&gt; [2,4]</code></pre>
<p>Hey, what the hell? Why is my <code>resultWithLoop</code> missing an item? I started my index at zero, I only incremented one at a time, and I'm ensuring I don't have an out of bounds error by ensuring I don't include the element at index <code>myArray.length</code>.</p>
<p>Oh wait, that <code>&lt;</code> in my for-loop should be a <code>&lt;=</code> (or I could remove the <code>-1</code> from <code>myArray.length-1</code>). My mistake.</p>
<p>The for-loop is too powerful to care about what you're actually using it for. Maybe you actually did want to exclude the final element, how could it know?  Luckily we caught this one early, but whether you're missing an <code>=</code> or missing a grenade pin, sometimes by the time you realise your mistake, it's already too late.</p>
<p>The reason <code>.map</code> is the appropriate choice here is because it is an abstraction that hides the control flow of looping through each item in a list, meaning it's impossible for you to get it wrong. When you use <code>.map</code>, you are guaranteed that the result will have as many elements as the original map, and that each element in the output array is a function only of the corresponding element in the input array**.</p>
<h4>Easy comprehension by others</h4>
<p>comparing the for-loop approach and the <code>.map</code> approach above, which is easier to parse as a reader? If you're only familiar with for-loops, you'll pick that, but given the ubiquity of <code>.map</code> in programming languages today, it's probably time to learn it. For those familiar with both, the <code>.map</code> approach is far easier to read:</p>
<ul>
<li>You don't need to read through how the <code>i</code> variable is manipulated in the for-loop, because that's abstracted away.</li>
<li>You know what the shape of the output will be.</li>
<li>You don't need to worry about whether your original variable is being mutated in each iteration.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without even looking at the callback function passed to <code>.map</code> you know a great deal about what to expect from the result. The same cannot be said of the for-loop.</p>
<p>Likewise, say I have an array of fruits and I want to know if it contains any apples. Here's a few approaches:</p>
<pre><code>const fruits = ['orange', 'pear', 'apple', 'apple', 'peach']

const hasAppleViaFilter = fruits.filter(fruit =&gt; fruit === 'apple').length &gt; 0
&gt; true

const hasAppleViaFind = fruits.find(fruit =&gt; fruit === 'apple') !== undefined
&gt; true

const hasAppleViaSome = fruits.some(fruit =&gt; fruit === 'apple')
&gt; true</code></pre>
<p>Each approach is ordered by decreasing power. Notice that <code>.some</code> is the easiest on the eyes? As soon as you see <code>.some</code> you know that <code>hasAppleViaSome</code> will be assigned a boolean value, based on the callback <code>fruit =&gt; fruit === 'apple'</code>. In the filter approach, you need to mentally store the fact that we're creating an array with a subset of the original array's fruits, and then we're checking the length of it, and comparing with zero. Only once you parse all of that do you realise the actual implicit intention, which happens to be the same as the <em>explicit</em> intention of the <code>.some</code> method.</p>
<p>These are just small examples, but when you have a big hairy callback with heaps of code inside, the reader can see that it's still just a call to <code>.some</code> and can rest assured that all the callback will do is return true or false. This calibrates the expectations of the reader and makes it easier to process what <em>is</em> happening inside the callback.</p>
<pre><code>const hasAppleViaContrivedSome = fruits.some(fruit =&gt; {
  if (typeof fruit !== 'string') {
    return false
  } 

  if (fruit === 'pear') {
    return false
  } 

  if (fruit === 'orange') {
    return false
  } 

  if (fruit === 'forbidden fruit') {
    return false
  }

  if (fruit.substring(1, 4) === 'pple') {
    return fruit === 'apple'
  }

  return false
})</code></pre>
<p>On the other hand, when somebody comes across your code and sees a powerful function used to perform something as trivial as a <code>.some</code> call, they're going to be more confused than the time they stumbled upon a grenade in the place you usually keep the fly swatter.</p>

				A few years ago, I started doing small projects with the 65C02 processor to build up to using it to make a graphing calculator. There are a few different languages that you can use to write programs for this processor with assembly offering the best performance. One of the projects I worked on is an optimizer to make assembly programs run faster. It works by tracing program flow then assigning fixed addresses to local variables in functions instead of storing them on the stack. To figure out how much of an improvement the optimizer adds, I made a game in Python then ported it to both traditional assembly and the new optimized assembly format. I also ported the game to C and Forth to see how fast they are compared to the assembly versions.

			<h2>Why 65C02?</h2>
			
			</a><p><a name="Why6502">
				The </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WDC_65C02">65C02</a> is an improved version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502">6502</a> used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600">Atari 2600</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System">Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_I">first</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II">two</a> computers made by Apple. Because the 65C02 is made with more modern CMOS transistors, it’s much more energy efficient and runs at up to 14 MHz, compared to the 1-3 MHz of the original 6502. Both of these things make it a good choice for a graphing calculator. For comparison, the very common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-83_series#TI-83_Plus">TI-83+</a> made by Texas Instruments has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80">Zilog Z80</a> running at 6 MHz. Since the Z80 needs 3-4 times more cycles to accomplish the same work as a 6502, a 65C02 running at full speed should be 7-9 times more powerful than the Z80 in a TI-83+. Another advantage of the 65C02 is that it’s still sold in a DIP package, so it’s easy to find and experiment with on a breadboard. There aren’t many better choices in a throughhole package. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68000">Motorola 68000</a> is more powerful MHz for MHz, but it's already used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-89_series">TI-89</a>, so I would like to use something different. Some throughhole microcontrollers have much more processing power, though not much RAM and no way to add more without an external address bus. The throughhole <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIC_microcontrollers#PIC32M_MIPS-based_line">PIC32</a>, for example, runs at up to 50 MHz, but only has 64 kB of RAM. For comparison, the TI-89 introduced in 1998 and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_49/50_series#49G">HP-49G</a> from 1999 had 256 kB and 512 kB of RAM respectively. Since the 65C02 has an open address bus, there is no limit to the amount of RAM and ROM it can access.
			</p>

			<a name="TheLanguages">
			<h2>The Languages</h2>
			
			<p>
				These are the languages that I want to compare:
			</p>
			</a><ol><a name="TheLanguages">
				<li><b>Traditional assembly</b> - This is plain old 65C02 assembly. Like many 65(C)02 (ie 6502 or 65C02) programs, it uses the X register as a stack pointer for a data stack (more details on this below). Some functions copy and save data from the fastest region of memory called zero page to free it up for use and restore the data when the function ends (more details on this below too).</li>
				<li><b>Optimized assembly</b> - This version of the game differs from traditional assembly since it doesn’t use the X register as a data stack pointer. Instead, local variables in each function are assigned a fixed address at compile time. The addresses are determined by a Python script that analyzes the flow of the program and tracks how much memory each function needs (more details below).</li>
				</a><li><a name="TheLanguages"><b>C</b> - This version is compiled with </a><a href="https://cc65.github.io/">CC65</a>, which seems to be the most popular C compiler for the 65(C)02.</li>
				<li><b>Forth</b> - This version is compiled using a modified version of <a href="https://github.com/scotws/TaliForth2">Tali Forth 2</a>. I picked this Forth since it generates subroutine threaded code (STC) which is generally the fastest, though largest, type of Forth code.</li>
			</ol>

			<a name="TheSimulator">
			<h2>The Simulator</h2>
			<span></span></a><p><a href="https://github.com/JoeyShepard/65C02_Emulator">65C02 Emulator on GitHub</a></p><p>
				All of the code runs on a JavaScript-based simulator I made that works in the browser. The simulation itself runs very fast on a separate thread using a web worker, while the main page is only responsible for the interface. This setup lets the simulation run at the equivalent of 40-50 MHz, several times faster than an actual 65C02 running at 14 MHz. Because it runs in the browser, you can try each version of the game for yourself:
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<a href="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/TradAsm/main.html">Robot Game - Traditional assembly version</a><br>
				<a href="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/OptAsm/main.html">Robot Game - Optimized assembly version</a><br>
				<a href="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/CC65/main.html">Robot Game - C version</a><br>
				<a href="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/TaliForth2/main.html">Robot Game - Forth version</a>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The simulator has sixteen memory banks of 16 kB each for a total of 256 kB of memory. The 65C02 has a 16 bit address bus, so it can only address 64 kB of memory at a time. To access the memory outside of the first 64 kB, the simulator simulates a memory banking system. Each 16 kB range of the 64 kB address space can point to any of the sixteen memory banks. This was a common strategy in retro computers to get around the limitations of a small address space.
			</p>

			<p>
				Memory map:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>0x0000 to 0x01FF - No banking</li>
				<li>0x0200 to 0x3FFF - Memory window 1</li>
				<li>0x4000 to 0x7FFF - Memory window 2</li>
				<li>0x8000 to 0xBFFF - Memory window 3</li>
				<li>0xC000 to 0xFFDF - Memory window 4</li>
				<li>0xFFE0 to 0xFFFF - Peripherals</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				The first 512 bytes are not banked since they contain the fast zero page memory and the hardware stack which always need to be visible from all banks. The last 32 bytes are for peripherals like the keyboard and for vectors for reset and interrupts. Each peripheral is assigned a specific address in this range, and the processor communicates with them by reading and writing to those addresses. Four bytes in the peripheral region control which of the sixteen memory banks each window points to. For example, if memory window 2 points to memory bank 7, then reading the first byte of memory window 2 at 0x4000 will access the first byte of memory bank 7 which is at 0x1C000.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The video memory is mapped one byte per pixel and takes up the 32 kB from 0x10000 to 0x17FFF (memory banks 5 and 6). The resolution is 256x128. Each byte has two bits each of red, green, and blue. Valid color codes are therefore 0-63.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The simulator has some interesting tools that helped port the game. Some of them were added during development because a specific problem arose that I needed to add them for. The main page lets you step through the code and shows the status of all the registers and each memory region that it accesses. There is also a memory viewer and a log of exactly which instructions have been executed. Copying this information into Excel or a text diff program helped track down several bugs in the game.
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_simulator.png" alt="Screenshot of simulator Robot Game runs on">
			<span>Simulator debug interface</span></p><p>
				Getting the cycle counts right for the executed instructions was a little tricky. For example, when an X-indexed instruction fetches an address where adding X to the low byte of the address overflows and the high byte of the address has to be adjusted, the instruction takes an additional cycle. After I got the logic for that fixed, the test code I was using was still a few cycles out of 3.5 million cycles off. Single stepping the program through all of those cycles to figure out which instruction was off would take too long. Instead, I loaded the code into the <a href="http://exifpro.com/utils.html">Kowalski simulator</a> then used a Python script to automate pressing the single step button and record the cycle count for every instruction. This generated way too much data to load into a spreadsheet, so I made another script to compare those cycles to the ones I generated in my own simulator and tracked the problem down to incorrect cycle times for the STZ instruction.

			<h2>The Game</h2>
			<span></span></a><p><a href="https://github.com/JoeyShepard/RobotGame">Robot Game on GitHub</a></p><p>
				The game is made in Python with the <a href="https://www.pygame.org/">PyGame library</a>. It was easy to read one big image into memory then copy parts of it into individual tiles that PyGame draws to the screen. Here are the images I came up with in Paint:
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_tiles.png" alt="Graphics tiles for Robot Game">
			<span>Graphics tiles for Robot Game</span></p><p>
				Several of these are tiles that I was experimenting with that didn’t make it into the game. Bright magenta (0xFF00FF) and bright cyan (0x00FFFF) are replaced with transparency when the tiles are created. Most of the tiles only have placeholder colors and are used as the basis to create other tiles. For example, the green, yellow, and grey color in the generic crystal graphic above are filled in depending on what type of crystal the game needs to draw:
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_crystals.png" alt="Crystal tiles for Robot Game"></p><p>
				The rock and lava tiles are constructed similarly from the generic tile above. There are four dirt tiles that are colored slightly differently and rotated at 90, 180, and 270 degrees to give the background some variety:
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_dirt_tiles.png" alt="Dirt tiles for Robot Game"></p><p>
				There is only one type of monster which is always colored the same, so a few tiles like that don’t have any pixels that change colors. Adding in some stats and a randomly generated map gets us to the main game window:
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_main_screen.png" alt="Dirt tiles for Robot Game"></p><p>
				The map is formed from the output of a random number generator. Using the same generator algorithm for each port results in the same beginning map for all four versions (and the same gameplay if the player makes the same decisions). I had to try several seed values for the RNG until I got a map I liked the look of as seen in the screenshot above. Here are a few that didn’t make the cut:

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_failed_maps.png" alt="Random maps for Robot Game that failed"></p><p>
				The rest of the game is just the three menu screens. The first displays a couple of stats and an inventory page. Moving the cursor over an item shows that item’s stats and what is currently equipped in that slot. Equipping an item changes the color of the corresponding part of the robot to match. In the tiles page above, the image of the robot is drawn with different colors that all correspond to the same colors that the generic item tile has. This means that the easy find and replace function to color in the individual items also works with the same color information on the larger image of the full robot.

                <p><span>10 July 2020</span></p><p>In <a href="https://monokh.com/posts/bitcoin-from-scratch-part-1">the previous part</a>, we covered the different data structures involved in Bitcoin: Keys, Transactions, Blocks and how they come together in the mining process. 

</p><p>In this part, we will go over how all of these pieces come together to produce a bitcoin "node". In the end, we have a node that we can interact with via the CLI. <a href="#demo">Skip to the demo.</a></p>

<p>The intention is not to create a real implementation of the Bitcoin protocol. The purpose is to demonstrate the concepts in a simple way. Watch for notes when there are significant discrepancies.</p>

<p>The code until this part of the series is available here: <a href="https://github.com/monokh/nibble/tree/52172a38bd54fe599c1cef4890c6dc772956bb2d">https://github.com/monokh/nibble/tree/52172a38bd54fe599c1cef4890c6dc772956bb2d</a></p>

<h2>Node</h2>

<p>A bitcoin node is a piece of software that runs as part of the bitcoin network. It is an implementation of the bitcoin protocol. As well as being able to mine, the node also has a copy of the "blockchain". It validates blocks and asserts that they follow the rules. These rules are otherwise known as "consensus rules".</p>

<pre><code>pub struct Node {
    pub blocks: Vec<block::block>, // Blockchain
    pub balances: HashMap<key::publickey, u32="">,
    pub mempool: Vec<tx::signedtransaction>,
    pub keypair: crypto::KeyPair,
}
</tx::signedtransaction></key::publickey,></block::block></code></pre>

<h2>The blockchain</h2>

<p>In the previous section, we demonstrated how mining a block happens but we didn't explain how blocks relate to each other. In reality they are not separate entities. Each block actually refers to the block that came before it. </p>

<pre><code>+------------------------------+       +------------------------------+       +------------------------------+
|        BLOCK 0 (HASH)        +&lt;--+   |        BLOCK 1 (HASH)        +&lt;--+   |        PENDING BLOCK         |
+------------------------------+   |   +------------------------------+   |   +------------------------------+
|                              |   |   |                              |   |   |                              |
|  +-----------+ +----------+  |   |   |  +-----------+ +----------+  |   |   |  +-----------+ +----------+  |
|  | PREV HASH | |  NONCE   |  |   +------+ PREV HASH | |  NONCE   |  |   +------+ PREV HASH | |   ....   |  |
|  +-----------+ +----------+  |       |  +-----------+ +----------+  |       |  +-----------+ +----------+  |
|  +------+ +------+ +------+  |       |  +------+ +------+ +------+  |       |  +------+ +------+ +------+  |
|  |  TX  | |  TX  | |  TX  |  |       |  |  TX  | |  TX  | |  TX  |  |       |  |  TX  | |  TX  | |  TX  |  |
|  +------+ +------+ +------+  |       |  +------+ +------+ +------+  |       |  +------+ +------+ +------+  |
|                              |       |                              |       |                              |
+------------------------------+       +------------------------------+       +------------------------------+
</code></pre>

<p>The diagram illustrates that each block refers to the hash of the block before it, thereby creating a "chain" of blocks. All together this is called the "blockchain".</p>

<p>This is very simple to add to our block structure.</p>

<pre><code>pub struct Block {
    pub hash: String,
+   pub prev_block: String,
    pub nonce: u32,
    pub transactions: Vec<tx::signedtransaction>,
}
</tx::signedtransaction></code></pre>

<p>This mechanism exists for 2 reasons:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A way to determine the ordering of transactions</li>
    <li>As blocks chain on top of each other, deeper blocks in the chain become harder to reverse as that will involve re-mining every block afterwards. </li>
</ul>

<p>You might now be wondering, if we follow the chain all the way back, where do we get to? When was the beginning of bitcoin time?</p>

<h2>The Genesis Block</h2>

<p>Block 0 is special. It does not have a block preceding it.</p>

<pre><code>static GENESIS_PREV_BLOCK_HASH: &amp;str = "000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000";
fn make_genesis_block (&amp;self) -&gt; block::ProposedBlock {
    return block::ProposedBlock {
        prev_block: String::from(GENESIS_PREV_BLOCK_HASH),
        transactions: vec![...]
    };
}
</code></pre>

<p>For the network to begin, someone has to mine this block.</p>

<pre><code>pub fn start (&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result<block::block, &'static="" str=""> {
    let genesis_block = self.make_genesis_block().mine(DIFFICULTY);
    self.process_block(&amp;genesis_block)?;
    return Ok(genesis_block);
}
</block::block,></code></pre>

<p>From then onwards, transactions can be sent to the network and eventually mined.</p>

<h2>Mempool</h2>

<p>The node keeps track of transactions that are awaiting inclusion into a block. This area of the node is referred to as the "mempool".</p>

<p>When a transaction is received by the node, it is added to the mempool.</p>

<pre><code>pub fn send_transaction (&amp;mut self, public_key: key::PublicKey, amount: u32) -&gt; ... {
    let tx = tx::create_signed(&amp;self.keypair, public_key, amount);
    self.verify_reg_tx(&amp;tx)?;
    self.mempool.push(tx.clone());
    return Ok(tx);
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    The mempool is actually a beast of it's own. In the real world, there are more transactions than there is space in a block. As such, transactions are also able to specify a fee that goes to the miner of the block, thereby competing for their inclusion. You transaction could stay in the mempool, unattended for several days (link).
</p>

<p>When the node is ready to mine, it adds the transactions in the mempool to a fresh block and begins mining it. Here you can also see us using the previous block's hash as part of the new block in order to continue the chain.</p>
<pre><code>let mut txs = vec![...];
txs.extend(self.mempool.clone());
let prev_block = self.blocks.last().expect("Previous block does not exist");
let proposed_block = block::ProposedBlock {
    prev_block: prev_block.hash.clone(),
    transactions: txs,
};
let block = proposed_block.mine(DIFFICULTY);
self.process_block(&amp;block)?;
</code></pre>

<p>When we have successfully mined the block, we process its contents as to update the state of the node.</p>

<pre><code>fn process_block(&amp;mut self, block: &amp;block::Block) -&gt; Result&lt;(), &amp;'static str&gt; {
    self.verify_block(&amp;block)?;
    self.process_block_transactions(&amp;block);
    self.blocks.push(block.clone());
    return Ok(());
}
</code></pre>

<p>We compute the new balance of each public key and store it in <code>balances</code>. The "coinbase" transaction will be explained later.</p>

<pre><code>fn process_block_transactions(&amp;mut self, block: &amp;block::Block) {
    for (i, tx) in block.transactions.iter().enumerate() {
        // Coinbase (first tx in block) is allowed to create new supply (by not deducting a balance)
        if i &gt; 0 { *self.balances.get_mut(&amp;tx.transaction.from).unwrap() -= tx.transaction.amount } // Deduct balance
        *self.balances.entry(tx.transaction.to).or_insert(0) += tx.transaction.amount; // Add balance
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Our balance mechanism is simplistic. In reality Bitcoin doesn't really have the concept of a singular balance. Transactions are a combination of inputs and outputs. Outputs that have yet to become an input are considered "Unspent" and consist part of your balance. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unspent_transaction_output" rel="nofollow">Unspent transaction outputs</a></p>

<p>Notice when we process the block, we also verify the block.</p>

<h2>Consensus Rules</h2>

<p>The consensus rules are a set of rules that the node will enforce for blocks and transactions before it considers them valid.</p>

<h3>Block verification</h3>

<p>First we ensure that the block has the correct PoW (0s at the start of the hash) attached to the block hash. </p>

<pre><code>if !block.hash.starts_with(&amp;"0".repeat(DIFFICULTY)) { return Err("Block verification: Must contain correct PoW according to difficulty") }
</code></pre>

<p>Next we must ensure that the block's hash is in fact the hash of it's contents. This mainly ensures that we don't receive a block with a proof of work that was manufactured without work.</p>

<pre><code>let block_hash = crypto::sha256(block.serialize());
if hex::encode(block_hash) != block.hash { return Err("Block verification: Hash must match hash included in block") }
</code></pre>

<p>We also ensure that the new block points to the last known block.</p>

<pre><code>let prev_block = self.blocks.last();
let prev_block_hash = prev_block.map_or(GENESIS_PREV_BLOCK_HASH, |b| b.hash.as_str());
if block.prev_block != prev_block_hash { return Err("Block verification: Must reference previous block's hash") }
</code></pre>

<p>Blocks that extend an older blocks are also kept by the node. This is incase they eventually become the longer chain. This also means that transactions included in a block cannot be believed to be <em>absolutely</em> final, only that it becomes exponentially less likely to be reversed as more blocks are added onto the chain succeeding it.</p>

<h3>Transaction verification</h3>

<p>It should not be possible to spend an amount of coin that you don't hold. There are 2 aspects to this:</p>

<h4>Signature validation: </h4>

<p>You shouldn't be able to spend from a key that you do not have they private key for. The private key is used to produce the signature of the transaction so this should be verified:</p>

<pre><code>if !tx.is_sig_valid() { return Err("Transaction verification: Invalid signature") }
</code></pre>

<p>Remember that the signature was produced by taking the hash of the transaction fields and signing with the private key. To verify: We take the hash of the transaction and verify using the public key.</p>

<pre><code>pub fn is_sig_valid(&amp; self) -&gt; bool {
    ...
    return secp.verify(&amp;unsigned_tx_hash, &amp;sig, &amp;self.transaction.from).is_ok();
}
</code></pre>

<h4>Balance validation:</h4>

<p>A transaction cannot spend more than the user has balance. We can use our balance index to perform this check.</p>

<pre><code>let from_balance = self.balances.get(&amp;tx.transaction.from);
if *from_balance.unwrap_or(&amp;0) &lt; tx.transaction.amount { return Err("Transaction verification: Not enough balance") }    
</code></pre>

<p>There are many more consensus rules that are required for a robust network. See <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_rules" rel="nofollow">protocol rules</a>.</p>

<p>There is one scenario where the balance of the user is not considered, effectively creating new bitcoin.</p>

<h3>Coin Issuance: The coinbase transaction</h3>

<p>The protocol needs to incentivize work in the form of mining. To address this, the miner is allowed to include a transaction to itself with a specific amount of bitcoin (the block reward) without deducting it elsewhere. Essentially creating new coins.</p>

<pre><code>fn create_coinbase_tx (&amp;self) -&gt; tx::SignedTransaction {
    let reward = self.get_block_reward(self.blocks.len());
    return tx::create_signed(&amp;self.keypair, self.keypair.public_key, reward)
}
</code></pre>

<p>This transaction which must be …</p></div></div></div>

				<div>
			<p>I’ve always had an interest in Quantum physics. I wasn’t taught the subject in depth but for any scientist (or pop scientist), the mystery of it is irresistible. <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/04/einstein-s-spooky-action-distance-spotted-objects-almost-big-enough-see">The most ‘spooky’ aspect (as Einstein described it) is the nature of entanglement</a>, where two atoms are separated across a universe yet somehow connected and behave in a joined up way. Equally mysterious is that it turns out that these smallest of particles making up every single thing, behave differently to regular particles. For example, the physical forces we are familiar with don’t work in the same way with quantum particles as they display light wave and discrete behavior both at the same time. In this atomic world, the only way to make sense of it is to theorize new laws which could explain the observations we see. All of this is wrapped up in a layer of uncertainty, as the quantum world works with probabilities rather than straightforward calculations. This is a lightning fast summary of quantum that clearly doesn’t do it justice but is meant as a teaser to a fascinating field of study. No matter how many times I read about this well established topic, it still feels unbelievable.</p>
<h4><b>What we know</b></h4>
<p>We see a lot about the concept of time in relation to quantum physics. The two topics are bonded together. I recently re-read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/no/book/show/38714658-the-order-of-time">The Order of Time by Carlo Rovelli</a> (a professor of Quantum Gravity and best selling author) which is all about this closely entwined relationship. <a href="https://recknsense.com/the-order-of-time-a-beautiful-explanation-of-quantum-physics/">I wrote a short piece about the book here.</a> In particular, the link between time, heat and entropy is discussed. Time could be dependent on heat or even be absent without it. There are many in depth articles on <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/">Quanta Magazine</a> if you haven’t come across this which reports on new scientific research including <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-correlations-reverse-thermodynamic-arrow-of-time-20180402/">this one on the possibility that quantum could reverse the thermodynamic arrow of time.</a></p>
<p>As we head into an era of applying quantum to real solutions, there have been some interesting developments. Quantum based technologies can work much faster and tackle more complicated problems and the concept of a quantum computer is a race that’s already begun. But there are some really mind blowing possibilities. Last year, there were attention grabbing headlines claiming that <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/03/14/103311/no-ibm-didnt-just-reverse-time-with-a-quantum-computer/">engineers had discovered a way to reverse time using a quantum computer.</a> It was quickly followed by a reality check – no we hadn’t really reversed time but for a brief second we may have believed it.</p>
<p>Further, this research from last year at the <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/12/191211145600.htm">University of Berkeley, explains the discovery that heat energy can leap through empty space thanks to ‘quantum weirdness’.</a></p>
<p>This is just a taste of the research out there. You’ll find a lot more available now and soon to be revealed as people are just starting to figure out the huge impact that Quantum technology could have.</p>
<h4><b>What I found</b></h4>
<p>I decided to do some research of my own into quantum and another area I’ve been looking into recently; the brain. Given quantum particles exist in everything including ourselves, could this spooky behavior be affecting the brain. Is there any research into it?</p>
<p>At this point, it’s challenging to find hard scientific evidence and I turn to this quote from Rovelli as a justification for trying to look for a connection.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Ability to understand something before it’s observed is at the heart of scientific thinking’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This whole premise could be regarded as ‘new age’ but many new scientific proposals have started out this way. I might not be the only crazy one to ponder on it – at least <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-new-spin-on-the-quantum-brain-20161102/">some were hypothesizing and attempting to experiment (this is from 2016).</a></p>
<p>In this research the proposal is that quantum effects might indeed play some role in human cognition. It attempts to combine our understanding of biology, neuroscience, chemistry and quantum physics to see if entanglement may be enabling quantum connections in the brain.</p>
<p>As we already heard, temperature has a big part to play in the quantum environment. So how might fluctuations between hot and cold that involve tiny agitations that lead to entropy be affecting the delicate arrangement of neurons and their connections? The answer is we don’t know and maybe we don’t need to as the body does a tremendous job of maintaining constant temperature.</p>
<p>However, there has been some research and experiments on the effect of temperature on our cognitive function. I could only find these that consider the impact of heat and as you might suspect, the impairment that can arise with high temperatures. It will come as no surprise that <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/warm-weather-makes-it-hard-think-straight/">warm weather makes it hard to think straight</a> and <a href="https://psychcentral.com/news/2020/07/08/too-much-sun-to-head-heat-stress-said-to-affect-cognition/157895.html">too much sun to the head is said to affect cognition.</a></p>
<p>Perhaps at some point in the future we will be trying to understand what is happening at a quantum level in our brains. In the same way that the physical world is altered with forces that we can’t see but we find a way to measure, could the brain and its thought processes also?</p>
<p>Experiments based on the brain and thought are tricky but over the last decade there has been a lot research in this area. It can be attempted scientifically e.g. MRI brain scans, researchers observing human behavior, and many strands of cognitive science. We have developed impressive technologies to measure what is changing in our brains as we think. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13058637-subliminal">This book by Leonard Mlodinow called Subliminal</a> is worth reading on the examinations into what happens to the brain during unconsciousness and provides a review of how far we’ve come to understand it over the last few decades.</p>
<p>Research that brings together different fields to focus on the brain is occurring.&nbsp;The <a href="https://www.brainengineering.org/brain-engineering-faq">Brain Engineering Lab</a> has a goal to gain a fundamental understanding of the brain, its mechanisms, operations and processes. Its members are experts in their fields that include neuroscience, computer science, cognitive sciences, and artificial intelligence. I couldn’t find any reference to quantum in the research. This might be a long way into the future.</p>
<p>Finally <a href="https://www.brainengineering.org/brain-engineering-faq">I came across some attempts to understand ‘quantum cognition’</a>, a possible new field that tries to marry human behavior and quantum thinking. In this case, an experiment was performed to model human decision making with quantum mechanics.</p>
<h4><b>So what?</b></h4>
<p>What happens if we did find something? If we can unlock secrets on how the brain and thinking can be manipulated, the applications could be ground breaking with benefits for humans and the machines that we use. However like every powerful technology usually is, it could come with even bigger concerns than the misuse of AI. The need for ethical principles and safeguards will be more important than ever.</p>
<p>We still have so much to discover about the quantum world but one thing we can expect is that it is likely to be stranger than we ever imagined.</p>

			<p>You’ve likely heard the saying: “A jack of all trades is a master of none.” It warns against the futility of pursuing too many disciplines. Be a specialist, or you’ll be nothing.</p>
<p>It may surprise you to learn there’s actually an extended version: “A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one.” With a subtle addition, its meaning becomes inverted to tout the benefits of being a polymath (a.k.a. generalist).</p>
<p>Why is the former so common, and the latter so unknown?</p>
<p>The answer lies in modern society’s preference for <strong>specialization</strong>. We’ll explore its origin, the limits it places on workers’ freedoms, and how the polymath approach can offer a reprieve. Finally, I’ll share my own experiences and learnings exploring a multitude of pursuits.</p>
<h2 id="cost-of-specialization">Cost of Specialization</h2>
<p>Following unprecedented growth during the industrial revolution, businesses faced more competition than ever before. In order to thrive, they sought new ways to operate more efficiently and productively. Division of labor was the solution they were looking for. By dividing the tasks needed to produce goods and services, individual workers could focus on specific tasks rather than developing a variety of expertise.</p>
<p>One important criteria to optimize for specialization is ensuring that workers stay in the same role for prolonged periods of time. This facilitates increased efficiency by reducing the need for training and allowing individuals to iteratively improve their ability to perform similar tasks. In exchange for their loyalty, the company offers its employees the security of long-term employment, along with additional incentives including tax-sheltered retirement accounts and access to healthcare.</p>
<p>In some parts of the world, these benefits come at a heavy cost to an individual’s freedom. In the United States for example, if you’re employed with a company, you get healthcare. Otherwise, you’re out of luck. Workers are often hesitant to switch jobs (let alone spend extended time without one) out of fear of losing their healthcare benefits. Another part of the problem is that the cost of healthcare in the U.S. is so high. A few days without healthcare and a single accident can push someone into financial ruin. As a result, many people stay at the same job year after year <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2019/10/25/more-than-half-of-us-workers-are-unhappy-in-their-jobs-heres-why-and-what-needs-to-be-done-now/#e8bfe3d20247" target="_blank">even if they’re unhappy</a>.</p>
<p>The lack of freedom might be a worthy sacrifice in exchange for job security. But therein lies the problem: few companies can actually guarantee long-term stability. Many workers already face ambiguity with their job security due to the impending effects of automation. Now, with the tornado of change brought about by the COVID pandemic, the brittleness of even large corporations’ stability has become apparent.</p>
<p>So how do we survive these waves of change? <strong>Adaptability</strong>.</p>
<p>Workers need to embrace a life of learning and self-evolution in order to thrive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to keep up with the world of 2050, you will need not merely to invent new ideas and products – you will above all need to reinvent yourself again and again.<br>
—Yuval Noah Harari</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Luckily, we have a template for how to do just that: the <strong>polymath</strong>.</p>
<p>Polymaths engage in extended learning across disparate fields, and apply their learnings to connect ideas and solve problems in unique ways. By nature, they’re well suited to thrive in a constantly changing environment.</p>
<h2 id="polymath-advantage">Polymath Advantage</h2>
<p>The key advantage that polymaths hold is their ability to develop <strong>mental models</strong> from different fields and apply them to solve problems in a unique way. This enables them to <strong>differentiate</strong> from their competition. Further, it creates opportunities for them to find truly <strong>meaningful work</strong> by pursuing their passions.</p>
<h3 id="differentiation">Differentiation</h3>
<p>One of the challenges with specialization is that it becomes harder to compete over time. This is a bit counter-intuitive. At first you might think the more ‘specialized’ you become, the more ‘rare’ your skillset is and thus, the better you are in terms of competition. There are two issues that arise as you continue down the path of linear specialization:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Over-specialization</strong>: This often happens to PhD students who have pursued very niche, highly specific areas of expertise. It’s rare to find jobs that can actually serve their level of specialization. They find themselves given a choice to continue their career in academia, or take a less desirable job in the workforce that doesn’t actually leverage their unique skills.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Diminishing returns</strong>: The larger your team is, the more difficult it becomes to be the <em>absolute best</em> in a particular area. As a simple example: It’s quite difficult to become the most technically proficient engineer in a given company. However, it’s much more straightforward to differentiate yourself through excellent communication skills, design sensibilities, leadership skills, and so on.</p>
<p>Once you hit the diminishing returns of specialization on one pursuit (<strong>the limits of depth</strong>), it makes sense to expand to other pursuits and diversify your skills (<strong>the opportunities of breadth</strong>).</p>
<h3 id="mental-models">Mental Models</h3>
<p>When you work in a particular industry for a while, you start to develop mental models based on its structures and dynamics. These are widely known <em>within</em> the industry, but not as much outside of it.</p>
<p>There’s where the opportunity comes in. If you find yourself working in a new area later in your life, you can combine mental models from different areas in ways that few others can.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the 17th century, Johannes Kepler didn’t have a wealth of existing knowledge or technology to work with. There was no concept of gravity as a force, and he had no notion of momentum that keeps the planets in motion.</p>
<p>Analogies were all he had.</p>
<p>From research on magnets, Kepler began to understand why planets moved toward and away from the sun. By picturing how boats might move in a whirlpool, Kepler began to understand the elliptical orbit patterns of planets.</p>
<p>—David Epstein, <em>Range</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The more pursuits you expose yourself to, the more models you have to work from, and the more you can stand out from the competition.</p>
<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
<p>I believe the strongest reason polymaths become polymaths is that they simply don’t have a choice. The urge to pursue one’s inner passions is strong, and those blessed with a variety of them often find them difficult to ignore.</p>
<p>The polymath’s search for meaning and purpose through different pursuits can be related to the Japanese concept of <em>Ikigai</em> (“a reason for being”):</p>
<p><img src="https://salman.io/img/ikigai.jpg">
</p>
<p>It can take many years or even decades before one sees any intersection between different circles. Yet a single taste can be intoxicating, and motivate a lifetime of pursuit.</p>
<p>What purpose could be greater than discovering purpose itself?</p>
<h2 id="my-inner-fox">My Inner Fox</h2>
<p>When I first began to study polymaths, I was excited to see a template for a life I didn’t know I was living. But when I started to embrace the polymath identity, my inner critics appeared. I wondered whether I’m even qualified to write about polymaths, let alone call myself one. After all, the <a href="https://notes.salman.io/the-definition-of-a-polymath" target="_blank">the definition of a polymath</a> is somewhat murky. I’ve spoken to a lot of peers who feel this same hesitation, and it’s been refreshing to connect with others who are taking a similar approach to life.</p>
<p>I also got a boost of confidence from a book called <em>Hedgehog and the Fox</em> by Isaiah Berlin. The book is a major source of inspiration for the generalist approach, and contrasts two proverbial animals: the specialist hedgehog and the generalist fox. I was elated to discover that the spirit animal for my <em><a href="https://brownfox.substack.com/" target="_blank">Quick Brown Fox</a></em> newsletter (inspired by <em>The Little Prince</em>’s fox) was incredibly prescient. It seems my destiny as a polymath fox was written long ago…</p>
<p><img src="https://salman.io/img/fox.png">
</p>
<p>I’ve been lucky to have held a lot of different roles and explored a lot of varied interests in my life. I’ve been a startup founder, software engineer, manager, teacher, public speaker, advisor, DJ and writer. Some of these are roles I’ve explored for decades, while others for just a year. Beyond that, I’ve also spent a lot of time on artistic hobbies like illustration and animation. In hindsight, there were a number of benefits I enjoyed as a result of combining different pursuits.</p>
<p>As a DJ, I had to learn to not just play my playlist, but to pay close attention to the audience and cater to them. Looking back, I think <a href="https://soundcloud.com/daretodj" target="_blank">each one of my sets</a> was a live lesson on how to find product-market fit.</p>
<p><img src="https://salman.io/img/salman-dj.jpg">
</p>
<p>Thanks to my <a href="https://vimeo.com/134677777" target="_blank">obsession with animation</a>, I learned to incorporate the principles of animation into the software I built. Later, when I was building digital healthcare experiences, I was able to use animation to bring the patients’ user experience to life. I brought a different perspective to the healthcare world (specifically: the idea that filling out a form could be <strong>fun</strong>).</p>
<div>
 <p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/134677777?portrait=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
</div>
<p>Through extended <a href="https://medium.com/@salmansays/teaching-in-paradise-12159066cd86" target="_blank">teaching stints at software development schools</a>, I built strong communication skills that paid dividends in future public speaking engagements as well as all my daily interactions with coworkers. As it turns out, explaining our ideas is crucial to our effectiveness, and teaching provides excellent practice for this skill.</p>
<p>The list goes on.</p>
<p>I didn’t do any of these things with a goal of being a polymath. I did them because <strong>I was drawn to them</strong>. It took many years before I started to see any benefits from mixing these pursuits.</p>
<p>Now that I’m intentionally embracing a polymath life, I hope to see the benefits compound even more. I’m excited to see how this plays out!</p>
<h2 id="freedom-isnt-free">Freedom Isn’t Free</h2>
<p>We’ve talked a lot about the benefits of the polymath lifestyle. I’d be remiss if I didn’t leave you with a few warnings about the obstacles.</p>
<p>One of the strange things about having multiple pursuits is that <strong>you never quite fit</strong> into social groups. I remember joining an iOS developers group where most of the members had been doing iOS development for more than a decade. Meanwhile, I had worked on countless platforms, in different roles across a variety of industries. We may have been in the same group, but we had lived completely different lives. It was …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Eleanor McDowall’s mantra has long been to “make the radio you would like to hear.” In an industry increasingly most hospitable to podcasts that deliver narrative twists and turns or breathless commute-sized information-delivery, which both translate into raw, monetizable download numbers, her mantra has led her to focus on a very different sort of audience growth challenge. Instead of fixating on how many people listen, she’s concerned with how they listen. And she’d like them to listen immersively, adventurously, as if “a little bit of air is coming in through their headphones.”</p><blockquote><p><span>“So much English-language audio flows easily across borders—because of the awful historical behavior of this country meaning this language is so widely spoken—but next to nothing comes in the other direction,”</span></p></blockquote><p><span>McDowall is based in London and is the director of her own independent radio production company, Falling Tree Productions, which fosters just this sort of reflective listening experience, most often for the </span><i><span>BBC</span></i><span>. By 2016, she had been making this kind of radio for a decade. She had won awards for her intimate, inventive documentaries, which explored, among other things, the political subtext behind Dr Seuss’ work, the raucous world of British Roller Derby, the last dances of ballet dancers, and the fantastical and surreal aspects of city living, inspired by the Italian author Italo Calvino’s book </span><i><span>Invisible Cities</span></i><span>. Then, one day in 2016, she had an experience which inspired her to be adventurous not just in tone and approach, but also in form.</span></p><hr><p><b>A transformative experience&nbsp;</b></p><p><span>McDowall was at an outdoor live radio listening event, called </span><i><span>In the Dark</span></i><span>, in London. The founding director, Nina Garthwaite, played a Norwegian radio piece, with the subtitles projected onto a large screen. It was the first time McDowall was listening to a podcast in a language she didn’t speak. It felt really natural. “And I was able to really hear it,” she says. “I forgot I was reading, and I really started to listen. It was transformative!”&nbsp;</span></p><figure id="attachment_311" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-311"><img src="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5616_McDowall-300x180.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="360" srcset="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5616_McDowall-300x180.jpg 300w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5616_McDowall-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5616_McDowall-768x461.jpg 768w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5616_McDowall-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5616_McDowall.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20360'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5616_McDowall-300x180.jpg 300w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5616_McDowall-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5616_McDowall-768x461.jpg 768w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5616_McDowall-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5616_McDowall.jpg 1920w" data-lazy-src="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5616_McDowall-300x180.jpg"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-311">Photo provided by McDowell</figcaption></figure><p><span>The experience made her realize the “secret hope” that she had long had, of stumbling across a big independent platform for non-English language audio. But when she thought about just how time-consuming translating and subtitling the audio would be, and how little money stood to be gained from it, she concluded that the only way such a project would ever exist was if she created it herself.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This led to the creation of her podcast </span><i><span>Radio Atlas</span></i><span>, which subtitles non-Anglophone radio pieces so that they’re accessible to Anglophone audiences. “Everything I share has been made elsewhere,” McDowall says. “But the intent is to offer a tool to access great audio made in languages you don’t speak.” She thinks audio is one of the only art forms that doesn’t have a popular mode of translation. Which feeds into the intent of </span><i><span>Radio Atlas</span></i><span>: “To try and start a conversation around that whilst opening up access to exciting audio at the same time.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The first piece that McDowall subtitled for </span><i><span>Radio Atlas</span></i><span> was the “extraordinarily tender” tale of an 87-year-old Norwegian man who believed that he had invented an everlasting battery. She entitled it “Still Glowing Strong.” She then subtitled a work called</span><a href="https://www.radioatlas.org/writer-2/"><span> “Writer,</span></a><span>” an expansive piece in which the Belgian audio artist Katharina Smets evokes her encounter with a Detroit-based poet in his home, in all its poetic, discomfiting detail. Then came “Robbery,” a rousing piece from Argentina about that country’s 2001 financial crisis.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>For most of these pieces, McDowall used translations by native speakers of the language, often the audio artists themselves.“I’m actually a fairly terrible linguist so I need a translation in front of me in order to grasp it,” she says. She subtitled each of these pieces slowly and painstakingly, on nights and weekends, using the software Final Cut Pro.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The heightened process of paying attention to tiny details—from specific region-specific quirks of radio production to the poetic turns-of-phrase of the translators she worked with—challenged her and reinvigorated her love of the medium.&nbsp;“There’s been so much I’ve heard that’s made me think about my own work that I’m making,” she says. “Bold use of sound and metaphor, the slowness and space in some work, fictional narrators in investigative documentaries, surreal humor in others, inventive interview techniques and so much more.”</span></p><hr><p><b>A dangerously one-sided conversation&nbsp;</b></p><p><span>In the past four years, McDowall has subtitled 45 podcast pieces for her video podcast. Among her favorites are a “very relatable” French podcast episode, “Mum Here,” featuring voice messages from mothers; a Swedish piece from the 1990s about a young woman’s dispiriting dating experience; and </span><a href="https://www.radioatlas.org/when-i-touched-the-ground/"><span>“When I touched the ground,”</span></a><span> a breathtakingly poetic piece in which one of the last remaining speakers of the traditional Indigenous language Pitjantjatjara relates the moment of her birth in a central Australian desert mesa.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The experience has made McDowall painfully aware of the “dangerously one-sided conversation” that has been taking place in the world of podcasting. “So much English-language audio flows easily across borders—because of the awful historical behavior of this country meaning this language is so widely spoken—but next to nothing comes in the other direction,” she says. “This feels like a dangerously one-sided conversation where, for example, podcasts like </span><i><span>Serial</span></i><span> can travel the world but inventive, bold, fascinating audio art from places where English is not the first language aren’t traveling in the other direction.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>McDowall thinks “so many things” are lost due to our monolingual listening diets. “From the perspective of understanding the world we inhabit, I think it’s never good if your idea of a place you don’t live is informed by reports that come from a touristic perspective, or ones that privilege the voices of people who just happen to speak your language,” she says. “Also, there’s the myriad different styles and approaches which we don’t get to hear because of the language barrier that might influence or challenge work we’re used to listening to in Anglophone countries.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This mission has been critically lauded. </span><i><span>Radio Atlas</span></i><span> has been featured at film and audio festivals around the world. It has also received awards, including a Special Commendation at the </span><a href="http://prixeuropa.eu/home"><span>Prix Europa</span></a><span> in 2016 and the Silver Award for Best New Podcast at the </span><a href="https://www.britishpodcastawards.com/nominations-2018-2"><span>British Podcast Awards</span></a><span> in 2018.&nbsp;</span></p><hr><p><b>A podcaster’s podcaster&nbsp;</b></p><p><span>An increase in critical recognition has not, however, resulted in corresponding audience growth. When I asked McDowall about </span><i><span>Radio Atlas</span></i><span>’s listenership figures, she replied, with a laugh, “Oh god, so tiny! It’s grown steadily but in very small increments! It’s a pretty niche listen. Individual episodes are listened to in the low thousands according to my stats—a small but loving following!”</span></p><p><span>As small as this may be to industry leaders such as the</span><a href="https://www.axios.com/new-york-times-the-daily-podcast-1-billion-downloads-05b0f648-5287-4995-bc37-421883f882b8.html"> <i><span>New York Time</span></i><span>s po</span><span>dcast </span></a><i><span>The Daily,</span></i><span> which rack up downloads in the millions, this is not too bad for podcasts that are a relatively challenging listen. Unlike the usual podcast listening experience, which can run in the background and be semi-ignored as you go about doing your household chores, a </span><i><span>Radio Atlas</span></i><span> piece requires your full concentration. You have to listen to the voice and the sounds and watch the subtitles float in and out on screen. But McDowall says she is heartened to see how many listeners are “open, interested” and willing to give such pieces their full attention, despite how far they are from the most popular modes of audio production. “In general I’m always surprised and delighted by how adventurous and accepting listeners are with those sorts of experiences as soon as they’re in them,” she says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Not surprisingly, a large part of the listenership of </span><i><span>Radio Atlas</span></i><span> is composed of fellow audio-makers, “people curious to hear new approaches or access work outside of their language.” And then, McDowall has noticed an uptick in listeners drawn from translation communities and language learners.“But what would delight me is just reaching as many people as possible with the central premise,” she says. “A reminder that every other artform they engage in can draw in work from languages they don’t speak and offer ways to access it. I want us to be talking more about how much of the world we’re not hearing in audio because of the language barriers between audio cultures.”</span></p><hr><p><b>More listening venues&nbsp;</b></p><p><span>In the pre-pandemic era, McDowall found cinema screenings worked “incredibly well” for </span><i><span>Radio Atlas</span></i><span>. “It sits very easily in a cinematic space, and more closely mirrors how you might imagine watching a film than it does how you might imagine listening to a podcast,” she says. “Building a space where people really</span></p><p><span>focus on the work has been very rewarding and meant that great audio work has moved very easily into documentary film spaces where it reaches new audiences.” The podcast also does well when shared on social media. “The visual aspect has also been helpful as clips of Radio Atlas podcasts basically already look like audiograms,” says McDowall.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>An interesting recent development, which McDowall hopes to make use of in the future, is Spotify’s decision to roll out complementary videos alongside its podcasts.&nbsp; </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21249389/spotify-video-podcast-test-upload-content-test-youtube"><span>This May</span></a><span>, it decided to test out this new feature with two hybrid vodcasts, on its app. “I don’t know enough about it yet,” McDowall says, “but it sounds like it might be a very useful tool to normalize subtitles and access to translations!”</span></p> </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Javascript became the most popular language in the world and with popularity “hardcore” engineers started to harass js developers and ecosystem. I have no interest in finding where this toxicity came from, but one of the stated issues is the size of a <code>node_modules</code> directory. I always wondered how this is that different from other toolchains: I have a lot of experience with C# (backend), Java/Kotlin (Android), Go (backend), Python (ML), ObjectiveC/Swift (iOS), Scala (backend) and some experience with ocaml/f#/haskel, and experience with NodeJS is so far the most predictable and depdendency tree is actually very <strong>compact</strong>.</p>
<p>TLDR: Sizes of installations for various languages to build UI app:</p>
<ul>
<li>NodeJS: 527MB (plain installation) + 182MB (node_modules)</li>
<li>Android: 914MB (plain installation)</li>
<li>iOS: 20+GB (plain installation)</li>
<li>Go: 659MB (plain installation) + 125MB (linux ui libraries)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://korshakov.com/content/node_modules_meme.png" alt="node_modules meme"></p>
<h2 id="main-difference-from-other-dependency-systems"><a href="#main-difference-from-other-dependency-systems" aria-label="main difference from other dependency systems permalink"></a>Main difference from other dependency systems</h2>
<p>One of the main power of NodeJS is an ability to use multiple versions of a single library within the same build. JS ecosystem is huge mostly because of how it is easy to publish anything, low bar for starting coding and the fact that this is most used language in the world that could run almost anywhere. Since JS is quite old at lack some huge stdlib you just need to use a lot small libraries that solves some specific problem for you. There was a lot of attempts to build some stdlib, but community simply too versatile to have a one-fits-all solution. You can think of it as a Scala ecosystem with a lot of ideas and experimental libraries that sometimes not that practical. Diversity is a huge win. For example because of React we now see declarative paradigms of UI programming in almost any ecosystem. Because you could have so many types of libraries you can choose between performance and easy of use. You can pick native bindings for sql, but could choose JS one, you can have a dozen of different ORMs or write yor own. All this makes JS ecosystem very strong and diverse.</p>
<h2 id="nodejs-benchmark-application"><a href="#nodejs-benchmark-application" aria-label="nodejs benchmark application permalink"></a>NodeJS benchmark application</h2>
<p>We are going to measure NodeJS size with Docker with base image <code>ubuntu:20.04</code>. Base image size is ~74MB and we will substract this size to get net size of nodejs setup.</p>
<p>Using docker</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>FROM ubuntu:20.04
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
RUN apt update &amp;&amp; apt install -y nodejs npm</code></pre></div>
<p>We get size:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>REPOSITORY          SIZE
test-node           601MB</code></pre></div>
<p>So far our plain node installation is 527MB. This is not the smallest installation possible, there are a slim packages avaiable that have size ~55MB total, but we are here to test dev environment, not production deployment.</p>
<p>Let’s add some npm packages:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>npm install express typescript webpack next</code></pre></div>
<p>We get image size:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>REPOSITORY          SIZE
test-node           783MB</code></pre></div>
<p>And resulting installation of nodejs with some frameworks is <strong>709MB</strong>. This makes <code>node_modules</code> to be <strong>182MB</strong> (709MB - 527MB), where Typescript size is ~80MB. NextJS is another ~80MB.</p>

<p>Well you could say that this is awful comparing NodeJS to Android, but i would say no, it is completely adequate: you are going to build an app for the most used OS in the world that makes this toolchain the most popular one.</p>
<p>To measure Android SDK actual size on disk i am going to use Docker images for predictable results. I found that a very minimal and clean <a href="https://github.com/thyrlian/AndroidSDK/blob/master/android-sdk/Dockerfile" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Dockerfile for Android SDK</a> already exist. It was built on top of <code>ubuntu:20.04</code>. To measure Android SDK size we will simply subsctract size of result image from base one.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>REPOSITORY             SIZE
thyrlian/android-sdk   988MB</code></pre></div>
<p>So, just to compile your android app you need a minimum of a wooping <strong>914MB</strong>. Also this docker image <strong>DOES NOT</strong> have an actual SDK in it, just java, kotlin, SDK manager and needed dependencies. Adding required platforms would boost it for another couple of megabytes. We can also try to count emulators as you probabbly will need couple of them instead of dozen of hardware devices, each emulator will be at least 1gb, much less than an additional browser (that requires only 100MB free on disk).</p>
<p>And you would say: this disk space is reused! Yes and no. SDK could be reused, that’t true, but android development is a combination of Android Studio, Gradle and Java/Kotlin. This trio deeply integrated and if you want to upgrade something you have to upgrade something else. Often you just pick to stick to specific versions for a while until something will require an upgrade and if it would require upgrade of a Kotlin than it could mean that you have to update your code, some libraries and what’s not. Sometimes latest versions simply not working. Sometimes libraries just dissapear from google repositories and you just have to upgrade and once in a while it happens just in the day of release.</p>

<p>Measuring size of an iOS toolchain is a very tricky part. But XCode requires you to have at least 20GB of disk space. Each version of iOS would eat another gigabyte. This list could go and go. Any fat binary usualy have 100MB+ size. Cocoapods and friends download sources for your projects and you have to wait for minutes to compile. My current app on top MBP takes 10+ minutes right now. During build they spawn a large amount of binary files that could became quite large.</p>
<p>Talking about dependency tree it is much more flat, but it is mostly about dificulities of reusing libraries. For example it is almost impossible to mix two versions of a single library, like, React Native use one version of Yoga and Texture uses another one and they are incompatible. Most of the libraries if need something they just vendor it or implement small feature by themself instead of relying on a community. Dependencies between projects are mostly whithin a single entity (organization, community) and almost never reused between. We all wish if it could work, but it is simply impossible to have anything deep in practice. This leads that usually every library have their own LRU cache, their own collections and etc. All of them have bugs and not developed within a single community.</p>
<h2 id="golang"><a href="#golang" aria-label="golang permalink"></a>Golang</h2>
<p>Installing a golang in a Docker is quite simple, but we need to also install gcc since a lot of packages requires.</p>
<p>For empty installation we are getting</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>REPOSITORY          SIZE
test-node           733MB</code></pre></div>
<p>So our pure installation of a Go is <strong>659MB</strong></p>
<p>But this is not fair, we are benchmarking building ui apps, web or desktop. Google have UI library (gxui) for go that requires dependencies: </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>libxi-dev libxcursor-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev mesa-common-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libxxf86vm-dev</code></pre></div>
<p>Lets’s install them:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>REPOSITORY          SIZE
test-node           858MB</code></pre></div>
<p>So installation that is ready to use without application dependencies is <strong>784MB</strong>.</p>
<p>Before go modules dependencies was quite fragile in golang world, but not everyone moved to them yet. In golang an actual dependency tree could go very deep just like NodeJS.</p>
<h2 id="results"><a href="#results" aria-label="results permalink"></a>Results</h2>
<p>If you pick any generic ecosystem that wasn’t built for small developer environment footprint you will always get to use a lot of disk space. </p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>One of the key elements of Google's software engineering culture is the use of defining software designs through design docs. These are relatively informal documents that the primary author or authors of a software system or application create before they embark on the coding project. The design doc documents the high level implementation strategy and key design decisions with emphasis on the trade-offs that were considered during those decisions.</p><p>As software engineers our job is not to produce code per se, but rather to solve problems. Unstructured text, like in the form of a design doc, may be the better tool for solving problems early in a project lifecycle, as it may be more concise and easier to comprehend, and communicates the problems and solutions at a higher level than code.</p><p>Besides the original documentation of a software design, design docs fulfill the following functions in the software development lifecycle:</p><ul><li><p>Early identification of design issues when making changes is still cheap.</p></li><li><p>Achieving consensus around a design in the organization.</p></li><li><p>Ensuring consideration of cross-cutting concerns.</p></li><li><p>Scaling knowledge of senior engineers into the organization.</p></li><li><p>Form the basis of an organizational memory around design decisions.</p></li><li><p>Acts as a summary artifact in the technical portfolio of the software designer(s).</p></li></ul><h2 id="anatomy-of-a-design-doc">Anatomy of a design doc <a href="#anatomy-of-a-design-doc">#</a></h2><p>Design docs are informal documents and thus don’t follow a strict guideline for their content. Rule #1 is: Write them in whatever form makes the most sense for the particular project.</p><p>Having said that, a certain structure has established itself as really useful.</p><h3 id="context-and-scope">Context and scope <a href="#context-and-scope">#</a></h3><p>This section gives the reader a very rough overview of the landscape in which the new system is being built and what is actually being built. This isn’t a requirements doc. Keep it succinct! The goal is that readers are brought up to speed but some previous knowledge can be assumed and detailed info can be linked to. This section should be entirely focused on objective background facts.</p><h3 id="goals-and-non-goals">Goals and non-goals <a href="#goals-and-non-goals">#</a></h3><p>A short list of bullet points of what the goals of the system are, and, sometimes more importantly, what non-goals are. Note, that non-goals aren’t negated goals like “The system shouldn’t crash”, but rather things that could reasonably be goals, but are explicitly chosen not to be goals. A good example would be “ACID compliance”; when designing a database, you’d certainly want to know whether that is a goal or non-goal. And if it is a non-goal you might still select a solution that provides it, if it doesn’t introduce trade-offs that prevent achieving the goals.</p><h3 id="the-actual-design">The actual design <a href="#the-actual-design">#</a></h3><p>This section should start with an overview and then go into details.</p><p><img alt="Visualization of how to draw an owl.

Focus on those trade-offs to produce a useful document with long-term value. That is, given the context (facts), goals and non-goals (requirements), the design doc is the place to suggest solutions and show why a particular solution best satisfies those goals.</p><p>The point of writing a document over a more formal medium is to provide the flexibility to express the problem set at hand in an appropriate manner. Because of this, there is no explicit guidance for how to actually describe the design.</p><p>Having said that, a few best practices and repeating topics have emerged that make sense for a large percentage of design docs:</p><h4 id="system-context-diagram"><strong>System-context-diagram</strong> <a href="#system-context-diagram">#</a></h4><p>In many docs a <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_context_diagram">system-context-diagram</a></em> can be very useful. Such a diagram shows the system as part of the larger technical landscape and allows readers to contextualize the new design given its environment that they are already familiar with.</p><p><img alt="Block diagram showing how various systems are related to each other.

In most cases, however, one should withstand the temptation to copy-paste formal interface or data definitions into the doc as these are often verbose, contain unnecessary detail and quickly get out of date. Instead focus on the parts that are relevant to the design and its trade-offs.</p><h4 id="data-storage">Data storage <a href="#data-storage">#</a></h4><p>Systems that store data should likely discuss how and in what rough form this happens. Similar to the advice on APIs, and for the same reasons, copy-pasting complete schema definitions should be avoided. Instead focus on the parts that are relevant to the design and its trade-offs.</p><h4 id="code-and-pseudo-code">Code and pseudo-code <a href="#code-and-pseudo-code">#</a></h4><p>Design docs should rarely contain code, or pseudo-code except in situations where novel algorithms are described. As appropriate, link to prototypes that show the implementability of the design.</p><h4 id="degree-of-constraint">Degree of constraint <a href="#degree-of-constraint">#</a></h4><p>One of the primary factors that would influence the shape of a software design and hence the design doc, is the degree of constraint of the solution space.</p><p>On one end of the extreme is the “greenfield software project”, where all we know are the goals, and the solution can be whatever makes the most sense. Such a document may be wide-ranging, but it also needs to quickly define a set of rules that allow zooming in on a manageable set of solutions.</p><p>On the other end are systems where the possible solutions are very well defined, but it isn’t at all obvious how they could even be combined to achieve the goals. This may be a legacy system that is difficult to change and wasn’t designed to do what you want it to do or a library design that needs to operate within the constraints of the host programming language.</p><p>In this situation you may be able to enumerate all the things you can do relatively easily, but you need to creatively put those things together to achieve the goals. There may be multiple solutions, and none of them are really great, and hence such a document should focus on selecting the best way given all identified trade-offs.</p><h3 id="alternatives-considered">Alternatives considered <a href="#alternatives-considered">#</a></h3><p>This section lists alternative designs that would have reasonably achieved similar outcomes. The focus should be on the trade-offs that each respective design makes and how those trade-offs led to the decision to select the design that is the primary topic of the document.</p><p>While it is fine to be succinct about solution that ended up not being selected, this section is one of the most important ones as it shows very explicitly why the selected solution is the best given the project goals and how other solutions, that the reader may be wondering about, introduce trade-offs that are less desirable given the goals.</p><h3 id="cross-cutting-concerns">Cross-cutting concerns <a href="#cross-cutting-concerns">#</a></h3><p>This is where your organization can ensure that certain cross-cutting concerns such as security, privacy, and observability are always taken into consideration. These are often relatively short sections that explain how the design impacts the concern and how the concern is addressed. Teams should standardize what these concerns are in their case.</p><p>Due to their importance, Google projects are required to have a dedicated privacy design doc, and there are dedicated reviews for privacy and security. While the reviews are only required to be completed by the time a project launches, it is best practice to engage with privacy and security teams as early as possible to ensure that designs take them into account from the ground up. In case of dedicated docs for these topics, the central design doc can, of course, reference them instead of going into detail.</p><h3 id="the-length-of-a-design-doc">The length of a design doc <a href="#the-length-of-a-design-doc">#</a></h3><p>Design docs should be sufficiently detailed but short enough to actually be read by busy people. The sweet spot for a larger project seems to be around 10-20ish pages. If you get way beyond that, it might make sense to split up the problem into more manageable sub problems. It should also be noted that it is absolutely possible to write a 1-3 page “mini design doc”. This is especially helpful for incremental improvements or sub tasks in an agile project–you still do all the same steps as for a longer doc, just keep things more terse and focused on a limited problem set.</p><h2 id="when-not-to-write-a-design-doc.">When <em>not</em> to write a design doc. <a href="#when-not-to-write-a-design-doc.">#</a></h2><p>Writing design docs is overhead. The decision whether to write a design doc comes down to the core trade-off of deciding whether the benefits in organizational consensus around design, documentation, senior review, etc. outweigh the extra work of creating the doc. At the center of that decision lies whether the solution to the design problem is ambiguous–because of problem complexity or solution complexity, or both. If it is not, then there is little value in going through the process of writing a doc.</p><p>A clear indicator that a doc might not be necessary are design docs that are really <em>implementation manuals</em>. If a doc basically says “This is how we are going to implement it” without going into trade-offs, alternatives, and explaining decision making (or if the solution is so obvious as to mean there were no trade-offs), then it would probably have been a better idea to write the actual program right away.</p><p>Finally, the overhead of creating and reviewing a design doc may not be compatible with prototyping and rapid iteration. However, most software projects do have a set of <em>actually known problems</em>. Subscribing to agile methodologies is not an excuse for not taking the time to get solutions to actually known problems right. Additionally, prototyping itself may be part of the design doc creation. “I tried it out and it works” is one of the best arguments for choosing a design.</p><h2 id="the-design-doc-lifecycle">The design doc lifecycle <a href="#the-design-doc-lifecycle">#</a></h2><p>The steps in the lifecycle of a design document are:</p><ol><li>Creation and rapid iteration</li><li>Review (may be in multiple rounds)</li><li>Implementation and iteration</li><li>Maintenance and learning</li></ol><h3 id="creation-and-rapid-iteration">Creation and rapid iteration <a href="#creation-and-rapid-iteration">#</a></h3><p>You write the doc.

Vanilla recurrent neural networks (RNNs) form the basis of more sophisticated models, such as LSTMs and GRUs. There are lots of great articles, books, and videos that describe the functionality, mathematics, and behavior of RNNs so, don't worry, this isn't yet another rehash. (See below for a list of resources.) My goal is to present an explanation that avoids the neural network metaphor, stripping it down to its essence—a series of vector transformations that result in embeddings for variable-length input vectors.
</p>

<p>
My learning style involves pounding away at something until I'm able to re-create it myself from fundamental components. This helps me to understand exactly <b>what</b> a model is doing and <b>why</b> it is doing it.  You can ignore this article if you're familiar with  standard neural network layers and are comfortable with RNN explanations that use them as building blocks. Since I'm still learning the details of neural networks, I wanted to (1) peer through those layers to the matrices and vectors beneath and (2) investigate the details of the training process. My starting point was <a href="https://gist.github.com/karpathy/d4dee566867f8291f086">Karpathy's RNN code snippet</a> associated with <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness">The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks</a> and then I absorbed details from Chapter 12 from Jeremy Howard's / Sylvain Gugger's book <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/12_nlp_dive.ipynb">Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch</a> and Chapter 12 from Andrew Trask's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Deep-Learning-Andrew-Trask/dp/1617293709">Grokking Deep Learning</a>.

In this article, I hope to contribute a simple and visually-focused data-transformation perspective on RNNs using a trivial data set that maps words for "cat" to the associated natural language.   The animation on the right was taken (and speeded up) from a <a href="https://youtu.be/ppz0XdEcGF4">youtube clip</a> I made for this article. For my actual PyTorch-based implementations, I've provided notebooks that use a nontrivial <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hunkim/PyTorchZeroToAll/master/data/names_train.csv.gz">family name to natural language</a> data set.

<h2>TL;DR &nbsp;Details I learned </h2>



As I tried to learn RNNs, my brain kept wondering about the implementation details and key concepts, such as what exactly was contained in the hidden state vector.  My brain appears to be so literal that it can't understand anything until it sees the entire picture in depth.   For those in a hurry, let me summarize some of the key things I learned by implementing RNNs with nothing but matrices and vectors.  The full table of contents for the full article appears below.

<ul>
	<li>What exactly is <i>h</i> (sometimes called <i>s</i>) in the recurrence relation representing an RNN: <img src="https://explained.ai/rnn/images/blkeqn-F224DE1728AA3CC4724E5AE9C5429D65.svg"> (leaving off the nonlinearity)? The variable name <i>h</i> is typically used because it represents the <b>h</b>idden state of the RNN. An RNN takes a variable-length input record of symbols (e.g., stock price sequence, document, sentence, or word) and generates a fixed-length vector in high dimensional space, called an embedding, that somehow meaningfully represents or encodes the input record. The vector is only associated with a single input record and is only meaningful in the context of a classification or regression problem; the RNN is just a component of a surrounding model.  For example, the <i>h</i> vector is often passed through a final linear layer <i>V</i> (multiclass logistic regressor) to get model predictions. 	</li>
	<li>Does <i>h</i> contain learned parameters of the model? No. Vector <i>h</i> is a local variable holding the partial result as we process symbols of a single record but becomes the final embedding vector after the RNN processes the final input symbol. This vector is not updated as part of the gradient descent process; it is computed using the recurrence relation given above.</li>
	<li>Is <i>h</i> the RNN output?  I think it depends on your perspective. Yes, that embedding vector comes out of the RNN and becomes the input to following layers, but it's definitely not the output of the entire model. The model output comes from, say, the application of another matrix, <i>V</i> to <i>h</i>.</li>
	<li>What is <i>t</i> and does it represent time? If your variable-length input record is a timeseries like sensor or stock quote data, then yes <i>t</i> represents time. Variable <i>t</i> is really just the iterator variable used by the RNN to step through the symbols of a single input record.</li>
	<li>What is <i>backpropagation through time</i> (BPTT)? BPTT is stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as applied to the specific case of RNNs that often process timeseries data. Backpropagation by itself means updating the parameters of the model in the direction of lower loss. BPTT refers to the case where we perform BP on <i>m</i> layers that reuse the same <i>W</i> and <i>U</i> for <i>m</i> symbols in the input record.</li>
	<li>Then what's <i>truncated backpropagation</i> or truncated BPTT? (First, let me point out that we don't need truncated BPTT for fairly short input records, such as we have for family names; my examples do not need to worry about truncated BPTT.) For large input records, such as documents, gradients across all (unrolled) RNN layers become expensive to compute and tend to vanish or explode, depending on our nonlinear activation function. To overcome this problem, we can simply stop the BP process after a certain number of gradient computations in the computation graph. It means not being able to update the model parameters based upon input symbols much earlier in the input stream.  I sometimes see the length of the truncated window represented with variable <tt>bptt</tt> in code, which is pretty confusing. <b>Note</b> that <i>h</i> is still computed using the full computation as described by the recurrence relation.  Truncated BP simply refers to how much information we use from BP to update the parameter models in <i>W</i> and <i>U</i> (and usually <i>V</i>). Vector <i>h</i> uses <i>W</i> and <i>U</i> but is not updated by BP. Model <tt>LMModel3</tt> and Section "Maintaining the State of an RNN" of <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/12_nlp_dive.ipynb">Chapter 12 in the fastai book</a> explain this in detail.</li>
	<li>Each variable <i>h</i> is associated with a single input record and is initialized to the zero vector at the start of the associated record.</li>
	<li>Matrices <i>W</i>, <i>U</i>, <i>V</i> are <b>initialized</b> exactly once: before training begins.</li>
	<li>Matrices <i>W</i>, <i>U</i>, <i>V</i> are <b>updated</b> as part of the SGD process after the <i>h</i> embedding vector has been computed for each input record in the batch (or single word if using pure SGD). As we iterate through the symbols in time, the <i>W</i>, <i>U</i>, <i>V</i> matrices do not change, unless we are using truncated BPTT for very long input records.</li>
	<li>Minibatching is a small subset of the input records split between records, leaving all input records intact.  However, in the situation where the input records are very big, minibatching can even involve splitting individual records, rather than just between records. Each record in a minibatch requires a separate <i>h</i> vector, leading to matrix <i>H</i> in my examples.</li>
	<li>When combining one-hot vectors for minibatching purposes, we must pad on the left not the right to avoid changing the computation. See this section: <a href="https://explained.ai/rnn/minibatch.html#sec:2.2.2">Padding short words with 0 vectors on the left</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Table of contents</h2>

I've broken up this article into two main sections. The first section tries to identify how an RNN encodes a variable-length input record as a fixed-length vector by reinventing the mechanism in baby steps.   The second section is all about minibatching details and vectorizing the gradient descent training loop.

<h2>Resources</h2>

First off, if you are new to deep learning, check out Jeremy Howard's full course (with video lectures) called <a href="https://course.fast.ai/">Practical Deep Learning for Coders</a>.

As for recurrent neural networks in particular, here are a few resources that I found  useful:
 
<ul>
<li>To get started with RNNs, I think the best first stop is probably <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEnXr6v2ifU">MIT's RNN intro video</a> to get an overview.

</li><li>Karpathy's well-known <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/">RNN blog</a> and associated <a href="https://gist.github.com/karpathy/d4dee566867f8291f086">code snippet</a> are really motivating and I used them as a basis to understand how the vectors flow through the RNN recurrence relation.

</li><li>Chapter 12 from Jeremy Howard's and Sylvain Gugger's book <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/12_nlp_dive.ipynb">Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch</a> is chock-full of both high-level and low-level details. The other chapters are well worth reading too.
	
</li><li>Chapters 11 and 12 from Andrew Trask's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Deep-Learning-Andrew-Trask/dp/1617293709">Grokking Deep Learning</a> has a lot of good stuff on word vectors and RNNs.

</li><li>Section 6.2 in FranÃ§ois Chollet's <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python">Deep Learning with Python</a> book does a really nice discussion and implementation using neural network layers; the book is very clearly written. It does, however, focus on keras whereas I'm using PyTorch for tensors in this article.

</li><li>Yannet Interian has a good <a href="https://github.com/yanneta/dl-course/blob/master/rnn-name2lang.ipynb">notebook for training RNNs that map family names to languages</a>.
</li></ul>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

I'd like to thank Yannet Interian, also faculty in <a href="https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/graduate-programs/data-science">University of San Francisco's MS in Data Science program</a>, for acting as a resource and pointing me to relevant material.  <a href="https://twitter.com/bearpelican">Andrew Shaw</a> and <a href="https://zeigermann.eu/">Oliver Zeigermann</a> also answered a lot of my questions and filled in lots of implementation details.

<small>Ian Grant <a href="http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mathematics.hol/1889">kindly made this page available</a>. This was previously hosted at http://ian-grant.net/hm (but is not currently available there). Thanks Ian, this is an awesome tutorial!</small>


<p>Robin Milner's type system with parametric polymorphism was a
significant advance over the systems of Russell and Church. Arguably
it is the ability to use type-variables that makes higher order logic
a practical vehicle for proving non-trivial theorems. The
Hindley-Milner algorithm is used to automatically infer types in
theorem provers and in several other functional programing languages.

</p><p>The algorithm, the type system, and some of the logical background are explained
in <a href="http://steshaw.org/hm/hindley-milner.pdf">this tutorial</a>, along with an implementation
in standard ML.
</p><p><img src="http://steshaw.org/hm/hm.png">
</p><p>This implementation is purely functional and is intended to show
the algorithm as clearly as possible. The image above is meant to show
that functional languages can be used to express mathematics and logic
in such a way that the correspondence between the mathematical and the
programmatic expressions may be as exact as one wishes. 

</p><p>This has practical consequences. In implementing the algorithm in
ML I found several errors and ambiguities in the mathematical
expression. These were cleared up in the process of constructing the
mechanical expression of the algorithm. The errors would have been
detected by the syntax and type-checking of the compiler, and the
ambiguity is resolved by the specification of standard ML semantics
which is more precise than any informal description of mathematical
notation that I have ever seen. Because ML is equally expressive but
more exact, I argue that the ML program is a a <i>better</i>
description of the algorithm than the mathematical one.

</p><p>Standard ML is Milner's language which uses this parametric
polymorphic type system. The core of the implementation of the type
inference algorithm consists in some 250 lines of code. It does not
include any explicit type annotation at all, yet the type of each and
every expression is inferred (and thereby checked) by the same
algorithm which is part of the compiler.

</p><p>The algorithm was proved sound and complete by Damas and Milner in
1982 and the proof is outlined in <a href="http://steshaw.org/hm/milner-damas.pdf">Principal
type-schemes for functional programs</a> which I have re-keyed because
the paper is so well-written and deserves to be more widely read.

</p><p>The source code is available as
a <a href="http://steshaw.org/hm/hindley-milner.sml">plain text SML source file</a> and
as <a href="http://steshaw.org/hm/hindley-milner.html">html formatted standard ML</a>.

					<div><p>Snovio is one of my personal favorite email finder tools.
</p><p>

Why?
</p><p>

It’s extremely robust and the closest comparison to Icy Leads.
</p><p>

Their plans are affordable and they allow you to find emails and send cold email sequences to them through email drip campaigns.
</p><p>

The only downside I’ve found to Snovio is the fact that they charge based on credits.
</p><p>

So if you’re looking for flexibility and don’t mind paying for a high volume of found emails, Snovio may be for you.</p></div>

They allow you to search their entire database and filter out the prospects that you don’t want to contact.

The data enrichment feature is also really cool because most of these other email finders don’t have this.

                    <h3 id="the-foodnoms-origin-story">The FoodNoms Origin Story</h3><p>One year ago, July 4th, 2019, was my last day at my previous employer. It was the end of a dream startup experience. I left having received exactly what I came for: to experience what it’s like to join at an early-stage startup and grow along with the company.</p><p>I was awarded many opportunities at my job. I led strategic projects. I grew as both an engineer and a leader. I was able to mentor junior engineers, lead tech talks, and make architectural decisions. However, I pushed myself really hard. Too hard. Despite being rewarded and celebrated for all of my efforts, I burned out at the end of my four years there.</p><p>My burn out was a wake up call. It made me realize I had focused too much on my work and lost touch with some of my own personal values. I knew it would be a mistake to jump into another full time job. I needed “me time”.</p><p>A normal person might have decided to just kick back, relax, maybe travel the world. I didn't want that though. I just wanted to do one thing: make a product just by myself.</p><p>I didn't waste any time. Right away I got to thinking about what to build. I knew I wanted to build something consumer-focused for a change. I did a brief brainstorming exercise: what apps do I use on my phone: (a) I frequently use, (b) makes money, (c) I could build in a few months, and (d) I don’t enjoy using.</p><p>This exercise was really effective and immediately led to the idea of building a food tracking app. The food trackers I tried were all slow, ugly, filled with ads and irrelevant content, were obnoxious with upsells, and didn't seem to improve at all over time. I knew it was a good idea because I immediately had a ton of ideas for how I could make something better.</p><figure><img src="https://ryanashcraft.com/content/images/2020/07/sketch.png"><figcaption>Notes and sketches from one of my earlier brainstorming exercises</figcaption></figure><p>I immediately got to work building what would become FoodNoms. Here's the first screenshot I have of the first version of the app, taken a little over a year ago, next to what the app looks like today:</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://ryanashcraft.com/content/images/2020/07/IMG_3410-1.png" width="1125" height="2436"></p><p><img src="https://ryanashcraft.com/content/images/2020/07/1-1.png" width="1242" height="2688"></p></div></div><figcaption>Left: The first prototype. Right: The app today, one year and over 2000 commits later.</figcaption></figure><p>At the start of this journey, I only had one goal: ship an MVP sometime in Fall 2019. I realized this was super ambitious, but I knew I could do it. I grinded really hard those next four months to make it happen.</p><p>What happened next really took me by surprise. FoodNoms had a fantastic launch and a great reception. Suddenly I had hundreds of paying customers with lots of feedback.</p><hr><p>After the launch in 2019, I decided to commit to spending a few more months focusing 100% of my time on the project. Those next few months evolved into six months, and here I am one year later after I started.</p><p>I did not originally plan to still be focusing 100% of my time on FoodNoms a year later after I started it. I also didn't expect it to be really appreciated, downloaded, or supported. These past twelve months have been incredible. I've learned so much and grown in many different ways that I did not expect. Even though I have made many mistakes and the product is far from perfect, I'm extremely proud of what I've built.</p><p>I'm writing this post to share some of the things I've learned, celebrate what I'm proud of, and open up about some of my struggles.</p><h2 id="numbers">Numbers</h2><p>I wish I could proudly start off the rest of this post boasting about my massive amounts of downloads and financial success. If you've been following along my story, you already know that the reality is FoodNoms has a long way to go in these departments. Here is where the app is at today:</p><ul><li>Days on the App Store: 240</li><li>Downloads: 12,397 (average 52/day)</li><li>Total revenue (post Apple's cut): $7,694</li><li>Current DAU (note, active usage means logging food): 200-300+</li><li>Total app updates shipped: 20</li><li>Current subscription churn rate: ~10%</li><li>US App Store: 4.8 stars with 203 ratings</li><li>App Store International Average: 4.7 stars with 304 ratings</li></ul><p>Here's a chart of downloads over time where you can see just how big of a launch FoodNoms had, as well as the impact of the recent exposure FoodNoms has received on <a href="https://twitter.com/caseyliss/status/1278074906270466051?s=20">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://atp.fm/385">ATP</a>:</p><figure><img src="https://ryanashcraft.com/content/images/2020/07/appfigures.com_reports_date--8-.png"><figcaption>Downloads over time since launch</figcaption></figure><p>However, if you exclude the launch and recent days, FoodNoms has only received 3,581 downloads, or an average of 17 per day.</p><figure><img src="https://ryanashcraft.com/content/images/2020/07/appfigures.com_reports_date--6-.png"><figcaption>Downloads over time, excluding launch and recent events</figcaption></figure><p>For an app with very cheap subscription plans, without large downloads, it's incredibly hard to build a sustainable business. No matter how good your conversion and retention rate is.</p><p>One positive note here is that I currently have 492 active subscription trials, thanks to all of the recent exposure. I have a fairly high conversion rate, so I expect MRR to shoot up quite a bit in the coming weeks.</p><p>While I wish that I had made more than just $7.5k in my first year doing indie development, I am more concerned about the lack of downloads and growth.</p><p>The main metric I look at is the the number of users that log food every day on a rolling average. On the left, you can clearly see the climb and fall of all the initial adopters that churned after the launch. This metric continued to decline until it bottomed out at 97 users in mid-March. Since then, it's been climbing slowly upwards until July where it has started to spike some.</p><figure><img src="https://ryanashcraft.com/content/images/2020/07/analytics.amplitude.com_algebraic-labs_chart_drj9wu1_edit_pdhsbxc.png"><figcaption>7-Day moving average of active users (note, absolute numbers are a lower bound)</figcaption></figure><p>What caused the slow rebound in March?

<h3 id="the-problem">The Problem</h3>

<p>I’ve been a big fan of Vim ever since my old boss <a href="https://github.com/dphase">Josh</a> introduced
me to it somewhere around 2014. Before that I had used mostly Sublime, but with a bit of
dabbling into Visual Studio and a couple of JetBrains IDEs. It of course took a while, but
once I had the basics down to muscle memory I was absolutely sold on Vim. It’s become just
how I type, and the little tricks that save a second or two here or there over the course of
a day add up to a real productivity gain. The <em>only</em> downside is that any time I’m typing into
something that doesn’t recognize vim keybindings I end up mashing escape too often and being
frustrated that things just don’t work as well.</p>

<p>Long story short, I just couldn’t get into any of the popular note taking apps because they
just weren’t Vim. I had a pretty short list of wants:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Some sort of syncing or backup. I take lots of notes on paper and I love that I can grab
  a notebook from five years ago and quickly get insight into whatever was happening at that
  time. I’ve got notebooks going all the way back to my very first internship, and they’ve
  actually come in handy more than once. I needed syncing or backup because it’s easy to see
  a scenario in which my computer accidentally drinks a cup of coffee and <em>woosh</em> there go
  a years worth of notes. No thank you.</li>
  <li>Maybe open source? I wanted this for the same reason syncing and backup are important. I
  take notes because I want to remember something. If a company can go out of business and
  my notes are gone… well that’s just bad news for me. I wanted something that I felt had
  real lasting power. At some point I realized that it’s honestly hard to be just plain ole
  Markdown files.</li>
  <li>Easy to access. If notes are painful to take, I’m not going to take them. Maybe I’m just
  lazy, but it’s the truth. I wanted something that was just a click or <em>maybe</em> two away
  from me opening it and using it anytime I’m at my computer. I don’t even care that much for
  taking notes from my phone or anything – I just want it to be <em>super</em> easy from my computer.</li>
</ol>

<p>You’ve probably got several apps queued up in your head to recommend to me, right? Evernote
was always a big suggestion, and I <em>did</em> enjoy using it for a long time. It did syncing so 
I wasn’t worried about my computer having the only copy. It wasn’t open source, but it <em>was</em>
a paid app that I could at least try to help stay in business. It’s not like it was hard to
access either – just start the app when I first start working and use Spotlight Search to
quickly hop to it whenever I wanted to take a note.</p>

<p><em>But</em>. It wasn’t Vim. It wasn’t Markdown either, so I knew that any note I took in it was
only going to be really useful within Evernote. Plus I didn’t really make much use of any of
the cooler features because I’m a simple man and typically take simple notes. So I plugged
along with it, but I wasn’t necessarily <em>happy</em> about it, you know?</p>

<p>Enter <a href="https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki">VimWiki</a>.</p>

<p>VimWiki is a “personal wiki for Vim – a number of linked text files that have their own
syntax highlighting.” It’s easy to access <em>(three keystrokes)</em> while I’m already in Vim, which if I’m on my 
computer working I 100% am. It’s got an easy to use diary feature, which is something I’d
been trying to do more often. It even supports Markdown, although I didn’t really use that
at first.</p>

<p>Now that I’ve got several months of use under my belt, I feel like I’ve nailed down a few things
that make it just about perfect for my needs.</p>

<h3 id="how-i-use-it-now">How I Use It Now</h3>

<h4 id="using-markdown">Using Markdown</h4>

<p>If you check out the project’s docs linked above, you’ll see that they’ve got their own syntax
that’s not at all hard to use. I’ve never used orgmode enough before to really know for sure,
but it at least <em>seems</em> similar. It’s a moot point though, because my very first suggestion
is to use Markdown instead. I’m sure there are benefits to the default syntax, but I know
Markdown well, I use it for just about everything else I write, <em>and</em> it renders well on
Github and Gitlab, which will be important later.</p>

<p>Telling VimWiki to use Mardown is as simple as adding this to your vimrc <em>(or init.vim)</em>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>g:vimwiki_list</span> <span>=</span> <span>[{</span><span>'path'</span><span>:</span> <span>'~/vimwiki/'</span><span>,</span> <span>'syntax'</span><span>:</span> <span>'markdown'</span><span>,</span> <span>'ext'</span><span>:</span> <span>'.md'</span><span>}]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Easy as pie. I didn’t do this at first so I had to do a fair amount of converting the default
syntax to Markdown, but that wasn’t very hard.</p>

<h4 id="gitlab-backups">Gitlab Backups</h4>

<p>I knew that I wanted my notes to be backed up and I figured that keeping everything in a 
git repository couldn’t be a bad idea. At first I would manually commit and push things up
whenever I thought about it, but that’s a bad plan because obviously I would never <em>plan</em> for
my laptop to bite it and me lose my notes.</p>

<p>I figured it would be easy to set up a cron job to just commit and push every fifteen minutes,
but it turns out MacOS deprecated the <code>crontab</code> command a long time ago. After I found
<a href="https://alvinalexander.com/mac-os-x/mac-osx-startup-crontab-launchd-jobs">this blog</a> I ended
up with this snippet located in <code>/Users/linell/Library/LaunchAgents</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;plist</span> <span>version=</span><span>"1.0"</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;dict&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;key&gt;</span>Label<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;string&gt;</span>com.linell.vimwikibackup<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>

  <span>&lt;key&gt;</span>ProgramArguments<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;array&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;string&gt;</span>/Users/linell/vimwiki/backup.sh<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/array&gt;</span>

  <span>&lt;key&gt;</span>Nice<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;integer&gt;</span>1<span>&lt;/integer&gt;</span>

  <span>&lt;key&gt;</span>StartInterval<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;integer&gt;</span>300<span>&lt;/integer&gt;</span>

  <span>&lt;key&gt;</span>RunAtLoad<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;true/&gt;</span>

  <span>&lt;key&gt;</span>StandardErrorPath<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;string&gt;</span>/tmp/vimwikibackup.err<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>

  <span>&lt;key&gt;</span>StandardOutPath<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;string&gt;</span>/tmp/vimwikibackup.out<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/dict&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/plist&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The file that it’s calling out to is stored directly in <code>~/vimwiki</code> and is as simple as this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>cd</span> ~/vimwiki
git add <span>.</span>
git commit <span>-a</span> <span>-m</span> <span>"updated on </span><span>`</span><span>date</span> +<span>'%Y%m%d_%H:%M'</span><span>`</span><span>"</span>
git push origin master
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With this set up, I don’t have to worry about remembering to manually do anything <em>and</em> I 
can guarentee that I won’t lose too much work if things ever go south. It’s also got the 
nice benefit of being displayed really well on Gitlab. The only downside I’ve encountered in
this approach that I haven’t figured out yet is that links that VimWiki generates look like 
 <code>[Foo](Foo)</code>, which isn’t clickable in Gitlab. It’s been easy enough to just tack <code>.md</code> 
 on the end of the link so that it’s <code>[Foo](Foo.md)</code> though, which lets me click around
 and view everything in a nice interface.</p>

<h4 id="easy-access">Easy Access</h4>

<p>VimWiki is pretty darn easy to access from the jump. <code>&lt;Leader&gt;ww</code> opens the index file, which
is honestly what I use for most things. In my index file I’ve got a bunch of links generated
that will take me to the other pages that I use the vast majority of the time. There are a
ton of built in shortcuts that you can check out in their documentation, and you can find
cheatsheets like <a href="http://thedarnedestthing.com/vimwiki%20cheatsheet">this one</a> that make things
pretty easy to learn.</p>

<p>The only things I’ve really added to make my life easier are a command to open the diary
and another to open my scratch buffer. From the diary file you can see a list of all of your
diary entries, which is pretty self explanatory. The scratch buffer is another trick that I
picked up from Josh mentioned in the beginning of this post, and it’s simple but super
effective: it’s a file I use to just store random stuff I need to type out. It’s mostly little
snippets of code that I want to copy paste all at once, or things that don’t really need to
be in my project’s source control but I <em>do</em> want a record of having done. 
<a href="https://gist.github.com/dphase/1792d67b4ac06aea11a49ed801f18a7e">His command</a> is much cooler
but overkill for what I needed. I just created a regular link to a new file from my wiki
index and then a command to easily open it. The command probably sucks, but it works. Here
are both of those:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>command! Diary VimwikiDiaryIndex

"" Lame adaptation of Josh's buffer file here: 
""  https://gist.github.com/dphase/1792d67b4ac06aea11a49ed801f18a7e
function! s:DScratch()
  exe 'edit ~/vimwiki/Scratch Buffer.md'
endfunction

command! Scratch call s:DScratch(&lt;f-args&gt;)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>VimWiki works super well for everything I need for taking notes. It hits all of my criteria,
it’s easy to set up and use, and honestly it’s neat to not need <em>another</em> app. I’m sure I’ll continue to 
refine and improve my setup over time, but I can’t suggest it highly enough overall.</p>

      <article>
        

        <p>In my experience, when students learn data structures they (1) learn how they work theoretically (2) use off-the-shelf data structures to solve problems and (3) sometimes implement these data structures from scratch. However, I don’t often see classes exploring the off-the-shelf implementations, and the interesting practical considerations that come along with them.</p>

<p>When I was a TA for <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/">6.006</a>, I had students answer the following questions about Python dictionaries. I hope they were a fun way to experiment with hash tables “in the wild”–I definitely learned a lot while preparing this! Solutions are at the end.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Recall that Python implements dictionaries using a hash table with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_addressing">open addressing</a>. Long story short, dictionaries have an underlying array that stores key-value pairs. When inserting a key, Python uses hash values to “probe” through this array in a specific sequence until it finds an open slot for that key. This post assumes you have a basic understanding of open addressing. If you’d like a refresher on hash table concepts, <a href="https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/SortSearch/Hashing.html">this</a> might help.</p>

<p>Also, the internals of a Python dictionary aren’t a mystery: you can check out the <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Objects/dictobject.c">source code</a>! If you don’t want to read through everything, there are a bunch of resources explaining Python dictionaries, like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/327311/how-are-pythons-built-in-dictionaries-implemented">this</a> and <a href="https://just-taking-a-ride.com/inside_python_dict/chapter1.html">this</a>.</p>

<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>

<h3 id="problem-1">Problem 1</h3>

<p>Use a Python program to determine how the size of a dictionary, in bytes, changes as you insert keys. How does this affect insertion time, and why?</p>

<h3 id="problem-2">Problem 2</h3>

<p>Assume you have inserted \(e\) entries into a hash table that has the capacity to store \(c\) entries. Define the <em>load factor</em> of the hash table as \(e/c\). In addition, define the <em>compactness factor</em> of the hash table as (number of bytes allocated to the \(e\) entries) divided by (number of bytes allocated to the entire table).</p>

<p>Recall that the size of a hash table periodically increases to keep the load factor below a certain threshold. What is the maximum compactness factor of a Python dictionary, and how does that compare to the maximum load factor? How has this changed over different versions of Python, and why? It might help to read the <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython">CPython source</a>.</p>

<h3 id="problem-3">Problem 3</h3>

<p>Consider object <code>A</code>, which returns a random integer in the range \([1, n]\) on <strong>every</strong> call to <code>__hash__</code>. What’s so bad about this? Provide two examples of problematic code using <code>A</code> objects and dictionaries, and explain what goes wrong.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>random</span>    

<span>class</span> <span>A</span><span>:</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>n</span><span>):</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>n</span> <span>=</span> <span>n</span>    

    <span>def</span> <span>__hash__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>random</span><span>.</span><span>randint</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>n</span><span>)</span>

<h3 id="problem-4">Problem 4</h3>

<p>Object <code>B</code> differs from <code>A</code> in that we return a <strong>deterministic</strong> hash value in the range \([1, n]\). For various values of \(n\) and \(k\), compute how long it takes to insert \(k\) <code>B(n)</code> objects into a dictionary. Does this match what you theoretically expect? How does this compare to the “real world,” and what explains the difference?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>random</span>

<p>Here are brief responses to these questions: unless otherwise stated, I’m running these on my Macbook Pro using Python 3.7.7.</p>

<h3 id="problem-1-1">Problem 1</h3>

<p>First, we can use the following code to measure when the size of a Python dictionary changes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>sys</span>

<span>d</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>N</span> <span>=</span> <span>1000</span>

<span>last_size</span> <span>=</span> <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>getsizeof</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>)</span>

<span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>N</span><span>):</span>
    <span>d</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"foo"</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>getsizeof</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>)</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>last_size</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"key"</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>"new size"</span><span>,</span> <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>getsizeof</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>))</span>
        <span>last_size</span> <span>=</span> <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>getsizeof</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>)</span> 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This prints out the following, indicating that the table size <strong>doubles</strong> on certain insertions (it isn’t exact because dictionaries have a 96-byte overhead).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>key 5 new size 376
key 10 new size 656
key 21 new size 1192
key 42 new size 2288
key 85 new size 4712
key 170 new size 9328
key 341 new size 18536
key 682 new size 36976
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can also measure insertion time: here, we add \(N\) values to a dictionary, recording how long it takes to add each key. We add up the times over multiple trials to reduce noise:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>time</span>

<span>N</span> <span>=</span> <span>1000</span>

<span># times[i] stores how long it takes to add 
# i to the dictionary
</span><span>times</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>*</span> <span>N</span>

<span># Run multiple trials to reduce noise
</span><span>for</span> <span>_</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>10000</span><span>):</span>
    <span>d</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
    <span># For each i, measure how long it takes
</span>    <span># to add i and add the result to times[i]
</span>    <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>N</span><span>):</span>
        <span>start_time</span> <span>=</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>time</span><span>()</span>
        <span>d</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"foo"</span>
        <span>t</span> <span>=</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>time</span><span>()</span> <span>-</span> <span>start_time</span>
        <span>times</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>+=</span> <span>t</span>
  
<span># Find the 5 values of i that took the longest 
# time to insert
</span><span>top</span> <span>=</span> <span>sorted</span><span>(</span><span>list</span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span>(</span><span>N</span><span>)),</span> <span>key</span><span>=</span><span>lambda</span> <span>i</span><span>:</span> <span>-</span><span>times</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>])</span>
<span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>top</span><span>[:</span><span>5</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>times</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>])</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This returns the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>682 0.027842044830322266
341 0.015052318572998047
170 0.0094757080078125
85 0.006536006927490234
42 0.0048770904541015625
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unsurprisingly, these correspond to when the dictionary size doubles! This is because Python needs to allocate a new array and reinsert all existing keys into that array, which explains why insertion into a Python dictionary is actually <strong>amortized</strong> \(\Theta(1)\) in expectation.</p>

<h3 id="problem-2-1">Problem 2</h3>

<p>First, looking at <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.7/Objects/dict-common.h">dict-common.h</a> and <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.7/Include/pyport.h">pyport.h</a>, we can deduce that the size of a dictionary entry is 24 bytes. Therefore, given a dictionary <code>d</code>, its compactness factor is equal to <code>len(d) * 24 / sys.getsizeof(d)</code>. This ratio is maximized right before the dictionary resizes. To measure this, we can modify our script from Problem 1:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>sys</span>

<span>d</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>N</span> <span>=</span> <span>100000</span>

<span>last_size</span> <span>=</span> <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>getsizeof</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>)</span>

<span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>N</span><span>):</span>
    <span>compactness</span> <span>=</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>24.0</span> <span>/</span> <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>getsizeof</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>)</span>
    <span>d</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"foo"</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>getsizeof</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>)</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>last_size</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"key"</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>"compactness"</span><span>,</span> <span>compactness</span><span>)</span>
        <span>last_size</span> <span>=</span> <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>getsizeof</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>)</span> 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On Python 2.7, this prints the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>key 5 compactness 0.428571428571
key 21 compactness 0.480916030534
key 85 compactness 0.608591885442
key 341 compactness 0.651177593889
key 1365 compactness 0.66272859686
key 5461 compactness 0.665677948885
key 21845 compactness 0.666419223299
key 87381 compactness 0.666604789308
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The compactness factor clearly approaches \(2/3\), which matches the load factor stated in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.7/Objects/dictobject.c">dictobject.c</a>. (Also, note that different versions of Python have different table resizing schemes.)</p>

<p>On Python 3.7, this prints the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>key 5 compactness 0.4838709677419355
key 10 compactness 0.6382978723404256
key 21 compactness 0.7682926829268293
key 42 compactness 0.8456375838926175
key 85 compactness 0.8916083916083916
key 170 compactness 0.865874363327674
key 341 compactness 0.8773584905660378
key 682 compactness 0.8830384117393181
key 1365 compactness 0.8859800951968845
key 2730 compactness 0.8874200888503629
key 5461 compactness 0.888160034695869
key 10922 compactness 0.8885213005396317
key 21845 compactness 0.8887065715603049
key 43690 compactness 0.7999243224109415
key 87381 compactness 0.7999627701453185
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Weird. The compactness factor approaches \(8/9\), but suddenly shifts to \(4/5\). In fact, the maximum load factor is still \(2/3\), but <a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2016-September/146327.html">Python dictionaries have gotten more compact</a>.</p>

<p>So what’s changed? In the old implementation, dictionaries stored a single array of 24-byte entries. If a dictionary has capacity \(c\) and a maximum load factor of \(2/3\), then its maximum compactness factor is \((24 \cdot \frac{2}{3} c)/(24 \cdot c) = 2/3\).</p>

<p>This isn’t very efficient: if a third of the entries are always going to be unoccupied, we’re wasting 24 bytes on each of them. Python 3.6 solves this by storing an array of \(c\) <em>indices</em>, which it uses to access a separate array of \(\frac{2}{3} c\) 24-byte entries. When inserting a new key, Python (1) adds the key-value pair to the entries array (2) probes through the indices array until it finds an open slot and (3) stores the index of the new entry.</p>

<p>The size of these indices depends on the the value of \(c\): 1 byte if \(c &lt; 2^8 = 256\), 2 bytes if \(c &lt; 2^{16}= 65,536\) and so on. So for a dictionary with capacity \(2^8 \le c &lt; 2^{16}\), the maximum compactness factor will be \((24 \cdot \frac{2}{3} c) / (24 \cdot \frac{2}{3} c + 2 \cdot c) = 8/9\), which matches our observations. This is a pretty sizable improvement!</p>

<h3 id="problem-3-1">Problem 3</h3>

<p>In this example, setting <code>d[key]</code> then retrieving <code>d[key]</code> usually results in a <code>KeyError</code>: if the hash value changes, Python will be unable to locate the key.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>d</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>key</span> <span>=</span> <span>A</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
<span>d</span><span>[</span><span>key</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"foo"</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>[</span><span>key</span><span>])</span>    
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, setting the value of <code>d[key]</code> a second time should overwrite the first instance. If the hash value changes, however, it will insert <code>key</code> a second time and this program will print <code>2</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>d</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>key</span> <span>=</span> <span>A</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
<span>d</span><span>[</span><span>key</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"foo"</span>
<span>d</span><span>[</span><span>key</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"bar"</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Moral of the story: hash functions should be deterministic.</p>

<h3 id="problem-4-1">Problem 4</h3>

<p>If we insert \(k\) keys into a dictionary with \(n\) hash values, we expect \(k/n\) keys to be assigned to each hash value. For each value of \(n\), inserting these \(k/n\) values should take \(1 + 2 + \dots + k/n = \Theta(k^2/n^2)\) time. This is because every time we add a new key, we need to probe through all existing keys with the same hash value before we find an open slot. Adding over all \(n\), the time it takes to insert all \(k\) keys should be \(\Theta(k^2/n)\) in expectation. Note that probe sequences can overlap, so this analysis isn’t 100% accurate–we’ll get to that later!</p>

<p>We can verify this using the following code, which adds \(k\) <code>B(n)</code> objects to a table and measures how long it takes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>time</span> 

<span>def</span> <span>create_dict</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>,</span> <span>k</span><span>):</span>
    <span>d</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
    <span>start_time</span> <span>=</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>time</span><span>()</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>k</span><span>):</span>
        <span>d</span><span>[</span><span>B</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)]</span> <span>=</span> <span>i</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>time</span><span>()</span> <span>-</span> <span>start_time</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>First, for a few values of \(n\) we can see how insertion time varies with \(k\). Indeed, a regression will verify that insertion time increases quadratically with \(k\).</p>

<p><img src="https://akshayr.me/blog/images/chart1.svg"></p>

<p>Second, for a fixed value of \(k = 2000\) we can see how insertion time varies with \(n\). It shouldn’t be hard to verify that time is proportional to \(1/n\).</p>

<p><img src="https://akshayr.me/blog/images/chart2.svg"></p>

<p>Cool, these are consistent with our predictions!</p>

<p>So why doesn’t Python run into this slowdown? In short, hash collisions rarely happen …</p></article></section></div></div>

					<p>By now, most people have heard of, or at least the concepts popularized by, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma">The Innovators Dilemma</a>, a book detailing how large companies often fail when new technology arises, for a multitude of reasons, including fear of canibalising their own markets by innovating. There is however another point I would like to bring up as to why large well established companies can be slow to innovate and find their lead slowly (or sometimes very rapidly) deteriorate. Large companies reward success and not innovation. </p><h2 id="individualism-vs-the-group-in-good-times-">Individualism vs The Group, in Good Times.</h2><blockquote>"Nobody Gets Fired for Buying IBM". </blockquote><p>When we think of an organization, we often think of it as being a large, singular monolithic unit working hard to ensure its self-preservation and growth, that however is very far from the truth. The truth is, organizations aren't single units, but a grouping of many single units all working mostly for one goal, their own self preservation, growth and success. Because while from the outside an organization might have a single identity, behind the curtain, everyone is still acting based on whats in their own best interest and so how well the organization does is based on how well the interests of the individual and the organization as a whole are aligned. Is it in the CEOs best interested to increase profit margins? Probably, especially if their compensation is directly linked to the companies performance. Is it in the VP of Engineer's best interest to move every system in the organization to the cloud to help save the company millions in infrastructure costs a year? Well probably not actually, as best case scenario they get a pat on the back, worst case, they get fired and have a permanent mark on their CV should the project fail. So what do most people do? They avoid risk. Especially when things are going well and the company is making more then enough profit to cover any exceptionally large costs they might have.</p><p>Which is why people bought IBMs. Because you wouldn't be fired for it. The safe decision might not be whats best for the company in the long run, it might not even be whats best for the company in the short term, but more often then not, it is a guarenteed risk-free decision for whichever middle manager is responsible for making the decision on which vendor to purchase from.</p><h2 id="safety-is-temporary">Safety is temporary</h2><p>Now, this might all seem great so far right? If you take no risks nothing can go wrong? Well no, because you're competitors aren't other organizations who are taking the same calculated risks as you, they are competitors who are coming up with new and innovative ways to do what you do, but better, faster and cheaper. And sure most of them might fail, but there are thousands of them, all working hard to unseat you, all taking different risks and coming up with different ways to tackle whichever problem you are solving, and even if the majority of them fail, eventually that small minority will succeed, and when they succeed it might already be too late, but you will find yourself faced with two options, buy them, or copy them. </p><p>However, as we know, many organizations punish risk, and a large acquisition is definitely a risky. Plus they might not even want to sell. While copying them, is even riskier, you're committing massive financial resources with no guarentee of success. </p><h2 id="individualism-vs-the-group-in-bad-times-">Individualism vs The Group, in Bad Times.</h2><p>And once again, it comes down to the individual vs the group. As an individual in a large company who has the ability to make the decision on how to tackle a fast growing competitor, you have three options, do nothing, do something, start calling recruiters. </p><p>If you do nothing, you're simply a passenger on a sinking ship.</p><p>If you do something, you're a screaming passenger on a sinking ship, and making you plug the whole, or maybe you find yourself being held responsible for creating news holes that have made the ship sink faster.</p><p>And if you start calling recruiter, you're potentially a star hire that a competitor can snatch away and write a press release about, giving more credibility to themselves.</p><p>What do most people chose? Well a look at all the ex-IBM executives and staff now working at competitors might help you understand that most of the time, people chose whats best for themselves. After all, in hindsight, they will remember being pretty vocal about needing to innovate, they were just never given the go-ahead.</p><h2 id="never-punish-risk">Never Punish Risk</h2><p>Which is why it is important to reward innovation and execution, and not just results. To innovate you will fail most of the time, just by taking a look at some of the most successful companies today, such as Amazon or Google we see that internally they have far more failures then successes. Failures such as Amazon's Fire Phone, or Google+. Despite these failures however, they have continued to grow at a pace far greater than any of their competitors, and though not ever new product or project succeeds, when they do they result in successes and new markets that more than make up for all the past failures before them.</p><p>Most importantly however, this creates a culture where the individuals best interests are more perfectly aligned with that of the organization. Because as long as you work hard and give it your best, you can innovate, take risks and be rewarded for your successes without being punished for your failures. Now every employee is potentially one of the thousands of competitors working to do what you do better, faster and cheaper, except when they succeed, you succeed with them.</p>

Wrong-ish</strong></h2><h3>Insight #6: The wisdom of the crowd is wise</h3><p>At the end of each trivia contest on Water Cooler Trivia, we ask a “tiebreaker” question with a numeric response. In case there’s a tie at the top of the leaderboard (like when two people get 8 out of 10 questions correct), the winner is determined by whoever was closer to the correct answer on the tiebreaker question. It’s like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Price_Is_Right_(American_game_show)">The Price Is Right</a><em> </em>but without penalty for guessing too high.&nbsp;</p><p>We love noticing that the median response is often extremely<strong><em> </em></strong>close to the correct answer. <strong>When we asked about the ground length of the US-Mexico border, the median response was 1,800 miles which is only 8% off the correct answer of </strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/border-issues/2017/09/19/wall-how-long-us-mexico-border/676001001/"><strong>1,954 miles</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Hats off to the magical power of large numbers.&nbsp;</p><p>One more nerdy thing: over time, we’ve seen that the median is almost always closer to the correct answer than the mean, because we see the <a href="https://statistics.laerd.com/statistical-guides/measures-central-tendency-mean-mode-median.php#:~:text=As%20we%20will%20find%20out,for%20our%20data%20is%20skewed).">means get dragged “too high”</a> by massive outlier responses.<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f0783c9357902c0f6b1232d_tF-vkHnzKyr_62evfU1M3yiJ72Uwx_hAzcFHDK8zgWMpsf-HmHKDyBFsn6LtJxI5n2IPz0GcFFzZXlU9gTszPO8Pub9a2eFbHxB8sctlOWSMpu73DsF3lejqTWrfwp90cCJflUFk.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Insight #7: iPhones were always pricey</h3><p>On that same note, the wisdom of the crowds is especially wise when it comes to smartphone prices. Back when the iPhone first launched in 2007, the <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2017/09/12/iphone-prices-from-the-original-to-iphone-x/">price point of $499</a> was considered extremely high; this was back when Apple’s pet product was more of a luxury device and less of a world-conquering part of the global tech culture.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, <strong>when we took the median response from respondents, they were spot on: guessing $500 vs the actual price of $499.</strong><br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f0783ca8f37f3fe25638986_2fS6JLm5sE7AW7DId2Kz5DO7Y42cWvOpHsmjA5qYGnxaiQ4GLbq24Kpmccq--tIj9PgwW7TJY6U1O5gphqfP5VB4CiURHxchRXs1FhrEL5YROEPJd8dY7NEznb8zp-zm0WB5HEk9.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Insight #8: Tricky when not #23</h3><p>Michael Jordan was famously number 23 for the vast majority of his career, but there was a time in the 1994-95 season in which <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/chicago/bulls/why-michael-jordan-wore-no-45-out-retirement-and-why-he-went-back-no-23">he wore a different number</a>.

We loved that there were misspelled first names, misspelled last names, and misspelled both names.&nbsp;</p><p>While there’s been an incredible diversity of misspellings, we’re actually quite impressed that 95% of respondents have gotten the question correct (we accept misspellings as correct answers) and of those, nearly 60% actually did spell the famed aviator’s name correctly.<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f0783cb6fee366ba95eb49c_1KgmnXF8uLR9PnWkV6zXVYfX5fjRlRtaDAuseLfAKA4SgkcutD56L28F-DjNO_HtU8GvqmbRPDyvagHnLPL4mRgAzU5NM4eYHeswEP4zozea25E78h7VPDyYsNr95K1MGrbCNXwP.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Insight 11: Near-homophones are very tricky</h3><p>The Sistine Chapel’s name comes from Pope Sixtus IV, who restored it between 1473 and 1481. But we didn’t expect participants to know the namesake of the famous home of <em>The Creation of Adam</em>. What we <em>didn’t</em> expect was the commonly-misheard and thusly mis-remembered name of this religious place.&nbsp;<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>We saw </strong><a href="https://selectitaly.com/blog/rome/five-interesting-facts-about-the-sistine-chapel/"><strong>16th Chapel</strong></a><strong> and Sixtine Chapel pop up as responses nearly as frequently as Sistine Chapel.</strong> So if you want the world’s lamest party trick, ask someone you know where Michelangelo painted the ceiling and see if they’ve had the wrong name lodged in their head for years.<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f0783cab278318f5f34c1fe_v0sNh2JbHmyzyP1CmQxIRJBvZTmjuvH_oM_HeLBMtoJFtJ158yhJjIUiK-dIgpB1uTXwZbdMjOBPTF8UxrmA_5YlyulPLBFvDutlPd3w_dFq40yvx8aHjp0YJ_PmySwRcJsPJ-ic.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Insight 12: Samuel Jackson has a unique lightsaber</h3><p>We can’t really phrase this one any better than the legendary <a href="https://screencrush.com/star-wars-samuel-l-jackson-purple-lightsaber/">Samuel L.

And I was like, well s---, I wanna be able to find myself in this big ol’ scene. So I said to George, 'You think maybe I can get a purple lightsaber?' "</strong></blockquote><p>Although Lucas pointed out that lightsabers traditionally only came in red or green, Jackson responded with some pretty powerful logic: </p><blockquote>‍<strong>"Yeah, but I want a purple one. I’m like the second baddest Jedi in the universe next to Yoda."</strong><br></blockquote><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f0783ca6f99dcacbf8d8fb5_3k4FPiSFe7-seRvpYfAM45bw9H0gU2Bh4S5qigjfGrFn-jL2freb7X-0fPDa8byWpKrhgScVPV2R8AZ8ZA9sGiNKQdMYBFBOm8MpSEi7diJNWFTnqggr-pZc7HvLm4d8XF5pBOWE.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Insight 13: Fridays aren’t productive for anyone</h3><p>We’ll admit that this question swayed a bit outside the typical guidelines for what is and isn’t included in trivia questions, but we thought it was a rich question for the office workers that comprise the vast majority of Water Cooler Trivia participants.&nbsp;<strong>‍</strong></p><div><p><strong>We weren’t too surprised that 0% of people knew Friday wouldn’t show up as HR Managers’ </strong><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=most+productive+day+of+the+week+hr+managers&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS879US879&amp;oq=most+productive+day+of+the+week+hr+managers&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.5470j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8"><strong>perceived “most productive” day</strong></a><strong>, but the fact that over half of participants knew it was Tuesday was pretty mind-blowing.</strong> Maybe it’s because of all the Trivia Tuesday team building activities in the world...</p></div><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f0783cb90f705107dff2d74_G33rDWFpp1rxMLHlN-vBY3JxaSyff59S3cgv_LrUYP_4Q9jJtT01nPAzk9aG0bw_PL6wUhz7Tmr4MR1rMXW2JW0imbEffGdtN3wlKc1KlGxAy18psF8sYIjgbo_Q3SySoC6nyPCf.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Insight 14: Many different fruits can be dried and snacked on</h3><p>Confession: I wrote this question because I genuinely had no idea what fruit a prune came from.

<p>Let’s talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome#:~:text=Impostor%20syndrome%20(also%20known%20as,exposed%20as%20a%20%22fraud%22.">Impostor Syndrome</a>.</p>



<p>At some point in my software engineering/leadership career, it became evident that I was expected to have Impostor Syndrome. Indeed, it became clear that all underrepresented people in tech were expected to have Impostor Syndrome. I noticed this mostly in groups of women where especially the younger women would talk about “my Impostor Syndrome” as one would talk about “my arteries” or something else we just expect people to have. </p>



<p>I have a problem with this, and I’ll explain why. But first, a bit of context. I’ve been a woman in tech since the Dotcom Boom of the late ’90s. Throughout my career, I have been the only woman a lot: in meetings, on a whole floor of the office, in a codebase, on conference calls, at team lunches, you name it. As a Manager, then Director, and then VP of Engineering, I stood out even more. I’m currently the CTO of a startup, and a very small percentage of these roles are held by women. Despite that, I don’t have Impostor Syndrome. I’m confident that I bring a lot of qualifications to my job.</p>



<p>What I do have is what I like to think of as healthy self-doubt. There are plenty of gaps in my knowledge, but I’m confident that I can ask the right questions, figure out the solutions to problems, and understand what I need to learn. I’m confident that I can have gaps in my skillset because I can build awesome teams and rely on others to meet common goals. Where I can’t hire, I can learn. I don’t need to know everything or be everything to be successful. Does that mean I’ve never failed? Heck no! I’ve failed a bunch! So have all the people around me, regardless of demographics.</p>



<p>Healthy self-doubt is an important tool. It pushes me forward and keeps me from complacency. There’s no “resting on your laurels” in software careers. Success requires continued growth, evolution, and learning. Healthy self-doubt helps me know where to focus my efforts, it helps me prioritize. It helps me figure out when I’m in over my head so I can acknowledge that and then do something about it.</p>



<p>Impostor Syndrome, on the other hand, is really rough. I can only imagine what it must be like to worry that you’ll be uncovered as a fraud at any moment. If this is you, please know that I’m not trying to invalidate that in any way.</p>



<p>However, I believe that much of what we classify as Impostor Syndrome is actually healthy self-doubt and I would love for us to distinguish between the two. The danger with calling everything Impostor Syndrome is that it reinforces otherness. The word “impostor” reinforces the message that you do not belong here. </p>



<p>My point is this: if we expect everybody who is a little bit different to think of themselves as an impostor, we’ve totally lost the plot on this whole inclusion thing. Let’s add the notion of healthy self-doubt to the conversation so that we can distinguish between that which propels us forward and that which holds us back.</p>

<p>How to Start, Run, and Sell a Bootstrapped Business</p>







<div>
<div>
<p><strong>Welcome to <em>Zero to Sold</em>.</strong> This companion guide will introduce you to the world of bootstrapping a sustainable business. It will make you familiar with how bootstrapped enterprises are created, run, grown, and sold. It will guide you through all of the phases of a bootstrapped business, explaining key concepts and linking to articles on <a href="https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/">The Bootstrapped Founder</a> that dive deeper into each topic.</p>



<p>This is a living document. <a href="https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/contact/">Please reach out to me</a> if you find any errors, omissions, or falsehoods.</p>



<p>To get started, please begin with the <a href="#An_Introduction_to_Zero_to_Sold">Introduction</a> or use the table of contents to navigate to any section that you’re interested in.</p>



<p>The first sections will introduce you to bootstrapping in general and why I wrote Zero to Sold: my entrepreneurial journey with FeedbackPanda, from starting a bootstrapped business through running and growing it to $55.000 MRR, to finally selling FeedbackPanda just two years after founding.</p>



<p>The following sections are dealing with the four consecutive stages of a bootstrapped business: <a href="#The_Preparation_Stage">Preparation</a>, <a href="#The_Survival_Stage">Survival</a>, <a href="#The_Stability_Stage">Stability</a>, and <a href="#The_Growth_Stage">Growth</a>.</p>



<p>Finally, the last few sections will deal with the world beyond bootstrapping and provide you with further resources on the subject, as well as a bonus section on the many roles of a bootstrapped founder.</p>

<p>Many people dream of having a business that makes money for them while they sleep. Yet, most people never turn that dream into a reality. Life gets in the way, they say, and they aren’t cut out to be a business owner anyway.</p>



<p>I believe differently. I think that everyone can be an entrepreneur and create a sustainable business that will allow them to live a life of freedom and financial independence. It will require some sacrifice, as building a business will take a lot of work and time. But it will lead to a life of control, a life of choice, and a life of opportunity.</p>



<p><em>Zero to Sold</em> will show you what the life of a bootstrapped founder will look like. It will teach you how to fill all the roles required to run a business and what you need to get done in each stage of your bootstrapped company’s evolution.</p>



<p>No matter if you are just starting to think about being an entrepreneur, are in the middle of running a bootstrapped company, or are a seasoned founder, you will find useful strategies, thought-provoking anecdotes, and insightful concepts in this guide.</p>



<p>Every section will have a condensed paragraph containing the essential facts and ideas. If I’ve already written a specific article on the subject, it will be linked there using the 🔗symbol. If not, I will write it eventually and add the link later, so don’t hesitate to sign up for <a href="https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/newsletter/">The Bootstrapped Founder Newsletter</a>, where I announce new articles the week they’re published.</p>



<p>Please understand that while this is a guide, a manual, and a compendium, it won’t absolve you of taking responsibility for your own choices and actions. Carefully reflect if the experiences and bits of the advice laid out here apply to your business. In the end, you are the agent of your own success. Read and learn as much as you can, but treat all guidance and direction as anecdotal. You will have to find your own combination of strategies and tactics. <em>Zero to Sold</em> will help you get there.</p>







<h2><span id="The_FeedbackPanda_Story">The FeedbackPanda Story</span></h2>



<p>I wrote Zero to Sold because I’ve been through starting, running, and selling a bootstrapped business before. Within two years, I co-founded, ran, grew, and finally sold a Software-as-a-Service business called FeedbackPanda, a productivity tool for Online English teachers.</p>



<p>Of course, this wasn’t my first rodeo. I’ve been part of many internet businesses before, and I’ve had my fair share of failures. I was in businesses where we never finished building the product. I co-founded startups that fizzled out because we didn’t know how to market our service. I’ve been involved in companies that didn’t find a way to monetize their popular products, only to pivot to something completely different after many years of trying to make it work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ll be sharing my experiences from both FeedbackPanda and the not-so-successful startups in this book, as I believe that you can learn the most at the intersection of experience and knowledge. So I will provide you with both.</p>



<p>Let’s start with the business that changed my life. Let’s take a look at FeedbackPanda, a service born out of necessity, a product that solved one critical problem for a well-defined audience, allowing me to experience and learn the things that I have compiled into this book.</p>



<p>FeedbackPanda was a collaborative effort between me and my girlfriend, Danielle Simpson, who was herself an Online English teacher at the time. We bootstrapped the business from day one, and when we sold it for what I would call a life-changing amount of money, the Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) of FeedbackPanda had just reached $55.000.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Within two years, we had built a niche service from a proof-of-concept into a thriving business that was attractive enough for a Private Equity firm to take it off our hands.</p>



<p>So, where did this all start?</p>



<p>It started with a leg injury. In early 2017, Danielle suffered an injury that meant she couldn’t leave the house for a while. For a trained Opera singer like her, that made regular work impossible. You can’t invite your audience into your living room for a concert.</p>



<p>So Danielle looked for work she could do from home, and she found something interesting. A wave of Chinese companies had emerged that recruited native English speakers to teach English as a second language to Chinese students. She tried it out and was hooked immediately: it was a fun job, it could be done using just a laptop, and the pay was alright.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shortly after, she found that there were several large online communities of teachers who taught for various Chinese companies. Danielle joined those Facebook groups and forums and started hanging out with her virtual colleagues that numbered in the thousands at that point.</p>



<p>A few weeks into teaching on a full-time schedule, she noticed things that started as nuisances but quickly became painful problems. The teaching part of her job was great and fun, but certain formalities took way too much time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most noticeable problem was student feedback. After every 25-minute lesson, the teacher would have to write a few paragraphs of a lesson report that was supposed to inform the parents of what their child had learned, how well they learned it, and what they could practice at home. Having only five minutes between lessons to take care of this and everything else (ranging from grabbing a coffee to using the restroom), Danielle would defer this work until after she was done teaching for the day. It couldn’t be avoided, as the Chinese companies would not pay teachers for their teaching work unless the feedback was provided as well.</p>



<p>When Danielle started teaching 10-hour days, the added feedback time would often amount to almost two hours of unpaid overtime. That meant two hours less for spending time with me, meeting friends, or reading a good book.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So she did what everyone would do: she developed a system, using Excel sheets and Word documents to track information about what her students learned, how they did, and what to suggest to their parents. She started using text templates for the content of the lesson and the preparation hints, as the Chinese schools defined the curriculum, and it would be the same for every student.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We found out that many other teachers did the same when they started talking about their self-built solutions in their online communities. Teachers began to share their templates through Google sheets. It was clear that this was a shared problem in a very tight-knit community.</p>



<p>One day, Danielle and I talked about the painful experience of student feedback, and how her system, even though it helped, was clunky and overwhelming. I looked into it, and it seemed quite possible to build a web-based application that would do this work faster and more reliably.</p>



<p>We also saw that this would be a great business opportunity. There was a sizeable market with an apparent, shared, and critical problem. The problem was solvable, but no-one had yet built anything to make it noticeably easier. So we decided to build a validation prototype, see if it had a meaningful impact on Danielle’s day-to-day workflow.</p>



<p>It took me a week or two to build the system. When Danielle finally started using it, it was clear as day: she transferred her loosely structured Excel and Word files into the system, and the automation kicked in immediately.</p>



<p>Instead of two hours of extra work a day, it would take her less than ten minutes altogether.</p>



<p>We knew we were onto something big from that very moment.</p>



<p>I had built the software with potentially turning it into a SaaS in mind. It had an authentication system built on Auth0 that would allow users to log in using their Facebook accounts, after all, that’s where we knew they hung out. It had a rudimentary subscription system build on Stripe that allowed us to charge from day one.</p>



<p>So we released it to the public, built a landing page, and waited. Nothing happened. One or two people signed up for the free trial, but there was not much else. We hadn’t done any marketing, and we hadn’t made any sales. The service just sat there, idling.</p>



<p>And then, one day, everything changed. In a comment to a Facebook post about how teachers dealt with feedback, Danielle dropped the link to our product …</p></div></article></main></div></div></div>

July 10, 2020 | https://blog.sulami.xyz/posts/atreus/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.sulami.xyz/posts/atreus/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <p>I recently received my early bird <a href="https://shop.keyboard.io/products/keyboardio-atreus">Keybardio Atreus</a><span><label for="sn-1"></label><span><img src="https://blog.sulami.xyz/images/atreus.jpg"> Promotional photo courtesy of Keyboardio</span></span> from <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/keyboardio/atreus/description">the Kickstarter</a> and have now been using it for about three weeks, so I am writing a review for folks considering buying one after release.</p>
<h2 id="a-bit-of-history">A Bit of History</h2>
<p>Most of this is also outlined on the Atreus website, but here is the short version: my colleague Phil Hagelberg designed <a href="http://atreus.technomancy.us/">the original Atreus</a> keyboard in 2014, and has been selling kits for self-assembly ever since.</p>
<p>In 2019 Keyboardio, the company which created the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/keyboardio/the-model-01-an-heirloom-grade-keyboard-for-seriou">Model 01</a>, got together with Phil to build a pre-assembled commercial version of the Atreus. Their Kickstarter ran earlier in 2020 and collected almost $400k.</p>
<p>Phil’s original 42-key version can be built with either a PCB or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY2k75eWrLQ">completely hand-wired</a>, and uses a wooden, acrylic, or completely custom (e.g. 3D-printed) case.</p>
<p>Keyboardio split the two larger thumb keys into two regular size keys, bringing the total up to 44, and uses a PCB and Cherry MX-style switches mounted on an Aluminium plate inside a black ABS case.</p>
<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
<p>At a first impression, it is incredibly small<span><label for="sn-2"></label><span>Dimensions taking from the product page: 24.3 × 10 × 2.8cm, 310g.</span></span>, noticeably smaller still than the small <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLA22LL/A/magic-keyboard-us-english">Apple Magic Keyboard</a>. At the same time, it uses a regular key spacing, so once your hands are in place it does not feel cramped at all. On the contrary, every time I use a different keyboard now, I feel that half the keys are too far away to reach comfortably. It is also flat enough that I can use it without a wrist rest.</p>
<p>Mine has <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/3099/8088/files/CPG151101D213_Copper.pdf?11838687770053773851">Kailh Speed Copper</a> switches, which require 40g of force to actuate, with very early actuation points. They are somewhat comparable to <a href="https://www.cherrymx.de/_Resources/Persistent/13618248706cd28e75ab9bdf9e55e9f8794611c1/EN_CHERRY_MX_BROWN.pdf">Cherry MX Browns</a> without the dead travel before the tactile bump. As mentioned above, the switches are mounted on an aluminium plate, and can be swapped without disassembly.</p>
<p>The early actuation point of the switches does require some getting used to, I keep experiencing some key chatter, especially on my weaker fingers, though Jesse from Keyboardio is working hard on alleviating that.</p>
<p>When it comes to noise, you can hear that it is a mechanical keyboard. Even with relatively quiet switches, the open construction means that the sound of the keys getting released is audible in most environments. I would hesitate to bring it to a public space, like a café or a co-working space. Open-office depends on the general noise level, and how tolerant your coworkers are, I have not had anyone complain about the sound level in video conferences.</p>
<p>The keycaps used are XDA-profile<span><label for="sn-3"></label><span>Symmetrical and the same height across the keyboard, like lower profile SDA. That means you can rearrange them between rows.</span></span> laser-engraved PBT of medium thickness. Apparently there have been a lot of issues with the durability of the labels, so the specifics of that might change. I personally have had a single key start to fade a bit over 3 weeks of use, but I do not actually care.</p>
<p>The keyboard is powered by the <a href="https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATmega32U4">ATmega32U4</a>, which is a pretty standard controller for a keyboard, it is also used in the <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/">Teensy 2.0</a> for example.</p>
<p>I would judge the overall build quality as good. While it does not feel like an ultra-premium product, there is nothing specific I can actually complain about, no rough edges or manufacturing artefacts.</p>
<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p>Out of the box, the keyboard uses the open-source <a href="https://github.com/keyboardio/Kaleidoscope">Kaleidoscope</a> firmware, which can be configured with the (also open-source) <a href="https://github.com/keyboardio/Chrysalis">Chrysalis</a> graphical configurator.<span><label for="sn-4"></label><span><img src="https://blog.sulami.xyz/images/chrysalis.png"> Chrysalis with my Layer 0</span></span> Supposedly it is also possible to use <a href="https://qmk.fm/">QMK</a>, and Phil has recently written <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~technomancy/menelaus">Menelaus</a>, a firmware in <a href="https://ryansuchocki.github.io/microscheme/">Microscheme</a>.</p>
<p>I have stuck with (pre-release versions of) Kaleidoscope so far, which has worked out fairly well. Chrysalis is an Electron app, and doing sweeping changes in it can be a bit cumbersome compared to using text-based, declarative configuration, but it does the job. Flashing a new version onto the keyboard only takes a few seconds. I also have to mention the <a href="https://kaleidoscope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">extensive documentation</a> available. Kaleidoscope has a rich plugin infrastructure, very little of which I actually use, but it does seem to rival QMK in flexibility.</p>
<p>I am using the Atreus with <a href="https://colemak.com/">Colemak</a>, the same layout I have been using for almost a decade now, and compared to trying the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">Ergodox</a>,<span><label for="sn-5"></label><span>When I tried using an Ergodox for the first time, the ortholinear layout really threw me off, and I kept hitting right in between keys.</span></span> the switching was much smoother. I am mostly back to my regular typing speed of 80-90 WPM after three weeks, and I can still use a regular staggered layout keyboard without trouble.</p>
<p>The modifier keys at the bottom are unusual, but work for me. I use the three innermost keys with my thumbs, and the bottom edges by just pushing down with my palm. It does require some careful arrangement to avoid often having to press two modifiers on the same time at once.</p>
<p>With only 44 physical keys, the keyboard makes heavy use of layers, which can be temporarily shifted to when holding a key, or switched to permanently. By default the first extra layer has common special characters on the left half, and a numpad on the right, which works better than a regular keyboard for me.</p>
<p>The only problem I sometimes have is the lack of a status indicator. This means I have to keep track of the keyboard state in my head when switching layers. Not a big problem though.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>My conclusion is quite simple: if you are in the market for a keyboard like this, this might be the keyboard for you. It does what it does well, and is much cheaper than anything comparable that does not require manual assembly. I personally enjoy the small form factor, the flexible (set of) firmware, and the RSI-friendly layout.</p>
<p>I also want to highlight the truly amazing effort Keyboardio puts into supporting their customers. You can browse the Kickstarter or their GitHub projects to see how much effort they put into this, and I have been in contact with Jesse myself while trying to debug a debouncing issue in the firmware. I am very happy to support them with my wallet.</p>

<![CDATA[Converting Linux kernel modules from C to Rust]]>

July 10, 2020 | https://immunant.com/blog/2020/06/kernel_modules/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://immunant.com/blog/2020/06/kernel_modules/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>Earlier this year, we used the C2Rust framework to translate applications such as <a href="https://immunant.com/blog/2020/01/quake3">Quake 3</a> to Rust. In this post, we’ll show you that it is also possible to translate privileged software such as modules that are loaded by the Linux kenel. We’ll use a small, 3-file kernel module which is part of the <a href="https://github.com/Bareflank/hypervisor">Bareflank Hypervisor SDK</a> developed by <a href="https://ainfosec.com/">Assured Information Security</a> but you can use the same techniques to translate other kernel modules. The basic steps we’ll cover are:</p>
<ul>
<li>translating the C files into Rust,</li>
<li>compiling generated Rust, and</li>
<li>linking everything into a loadable kernel module.</li>
</ul>

<p>We transpiled the kernel module of Bareflank which consists of a small number
of C files: <code>common.c</code>, <code>entry.c</code> and <code>platform.c</code>. For the first step, we
needed to extract the kernel’s compilation flags and pass them to the
transpiler, so we would perfectly replicate the configuration settings and
macro expansions from the kernel build. We used the
<a href="https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear">Bear</a> tool to pseudo-build the original
kernel module and produce a <code>compile_commands.json</code> file containing the
compilation database:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd .../bareflank/bfdriver/src/platform/linux
$ make clean
$ bear make CC=clang
</code></pre>
<p>The kernel build system compiles C files differently (enabling or disabling
some language features) depending on the compiler used. Since the C2Rust
transpiler uses clang as its front-end, we had to use clang for the
pseudo-build as well. One complication we ran into were <em>asm gotos</em>, which are
a new extension to gcc’s inline assembly syntax that Linux started using in the
5.0 release, but were
<a href="https://releases.llvm.org/9.0.0/tools/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.html#linux-kernel">added</a>
to LLVM/clang in version 9.0. When we initially performed this experiment
(April 2019), that version of clang hadn’t come out so we were forced to revert
to an older 4.x kernel that did not use <em>asm gotos</em> just to get clang to parse
the C code. <em>Asm gotos</em> are now supported by clang, but the transpiler doesn’t
support them yet. We need to first investigate whether Rust’s inline assembly
(either the legacy version or the recently added
<a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2020/06/08/new-inline-asm.html">redesign</a>)
even supports this feature right now.</p>
<p>After producing the compilation database, we transpiled the C files into Rust:</p>
<pre><code>$ # Remove compiler flags we can't handle
$ sed -i -e 's/"-Werror.*",//' ./compile_commands.json
$ c2rust transpile ./compile_commands.json --emit-no-std \
  --emit-modules -o bareflank-rs "<a href="https://immunant.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="f9ddb9">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>"
</code></pre>
<p>After making some fixes and additions to C2Rust and fix the subsequent
compilation errors, we compiled the resulting Rust code with:</p>
<pre><code># cargo build --release --target x86_64-linux-kernel -Zbuild-std=core
</code></pre>
<p>We had originally used
<a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/cargo-xbuild"><code>cargo-xbuild</code></a> to accomplish
this without support from the Rust compiler, but the Rust team  added the
kernel module target to Cargo at the end of August 2019. Once that happened,
we could use <code>cargo build</code> directly to build our kernel module.</p>
<p>We had to make a few minor manual changes to the Rust files:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Replace <code>use libc;</code> with <code>use crate::libc;</code> since we had some problems
using the libc crate from crates.io inside a kernel module. C2Rust uses the
basic C type definitions from this crate, and we had to redefine them manually.
This might not be a problem anymore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manually remove a couple of duplicate <code>current_stack_pointer</code> definitions.
This variable is defined in a header in C and the transpiler emits it in
every transpiled <code>.rs</code> file as <code>#[no_mangle]</code>, which causes Rust linking errors. We
had to manually remove all but one definitions of this symbol (the symbol
wasn’t even used anywhere, so we could have removed all of them, but didn’t
need to).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once all the fixes were in, we successfully compiled the module but still had
to fix a couple of issues. First, Cargo produces a static library called
<code>libbareflank_rs.a</code>, but the kernel build system only supports object files and
not static libraries. We turned the static library into an object file by
calling the system linker from our kernel module <code>Makefile</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$(M)/libbareflank_rs.o: target/x86_64-linux-kernel/release/bareflank_rs.a
        $(LD) -r -o <a href="https://immunant.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="210561">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> --whole-archive $^
</code></pre>
<p>The second issue was that we were initially also transpiling the
<code>bareflank.mod.c</code> file that the kernel build system auto-generates from the input
object files. We were producing a <code>libbareflank_rs.o</code> that already included
a transpiled copy of this auto-generated file,
then passing that to the kernel build system that would produce a second
<code>bareflank.mod.c</code> and link that together with <code>libbareflank_rs.o</code> to produce
<code>bareflank.ko</code>. Having two copies of the contents of <code>bareflank.mod.c</code> was
causing crashes.  Once we removed the transpiled <code>bareflank.mod.rs</code> file from the build,
the kernel module loaded and ran successfully.</p>

<p>We encountered many C features and gcc-specific extensions that the kernel
headers use and we had to add to C2Rust:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A series of gcc attributes: <code>inline</code>, <code>cold</code>, <code>alias</code>, <code>used</code>, <code>section</code>
and more</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Updates to the C2Rust bitfields crate: support for <code>no_std</code> and booleans</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A gcc intrinsic used by some kernel memory functions: <code>__builtin_object_size</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inline assembly support in C2Rust for memory-only, read-write and early-clobber
operands</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Structures that are both packed and aligned, mainly
<a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/arch/x86/include/asm/fpu/types.h#L253"><code>xregs_state</code></a>.
This particular combination is not currently supported in Rust, so we had
to implement a work-around in C2Rust by emitting a pair of nested
structures (aligned outer structure, packed inner structure) instead:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>#[repr(C, align(64))]
pub struct xregs_state(pub xregs_state_Inner);
#[repr(C, packed)]
pub struct xregs_state_Inner {
  // ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>All of these issues have been implemented in C2Rust and should work for all
kernel modules, but different modules may expose new unimplemented C features.</p>

<p>C2Rust maps C types to their definitions in the libc crate, but we were
unable (at the time) to use this crate in our kernel module. Instead, we
redefined some of its types manually:</p>
<pre><code>pub mod libc {
    pub type c_char = i8;
    pub type c_schar = i8;
    pub type c_ulong = u64;
    pub type c_uint = u32;
    // ...all the others
}
</code></pre>
<p>(The <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cty"><code>cty</code></a> crate also provides the necessary type aliases<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.)</p>
<p>We also had to implement a couple of libc functions that the compiler relies on:</p>
<pre><code>pub unsafe fn memset(s: *mut c_void, c: c_int, n: size_t) -&gt; *mut c_void {
    core::ptr::write_bytes(s as *mut u8, c as u8, n as usize);
    s
}

pub unsafe fn memcpy(dest: *mut c_void, src: *const c_void, n: size_t) -&gt; *mut c_void {
    core::ptr::copy_nonoverlapping(src as *const u8, dest as *mut u8, n as usize);
    dest
}
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we added stubs for a few missing kernel functions, and for the Rust
panic handler (we decided to implement it properly at a later date):</p>
<pre><code>#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn __bad_size_call_parameter() -&gt; ! {
    unreachable!("__bad_size_call_parameter")
}

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn __bad_percpu_size() -&gt; ! {
    unreachable!("__bad_percpu_size")
}

#[panic_handler]
fn panic(_info: &amp;PanicInfo) -&gt; ! {
    // FIXME: call into the kernel
    loop {}
}
</code></pre>
<p>The main remaining “ugliness” is that the transpiler fully expands C macros, so
the transpiled code is not always pleasant to look at:</p>
<pre><code>   match ::core::mem::size_of::&lt;libc::c_int&gt;() as libc::c_ulong {
	1 =&gt; {
	    pscr_ret__ = ({
		let mut pfo_ret__: libc::c_int = 0;
		match ::core::mem::size_of::&lt;libc::c_int&gt;() as libc::c_ulong {
		    1 =&gt; asm!("movb %gs:$1,$0" :
					       "=q" (pfo_ret__) :
					       "*m" (&amp;cpu_number)
					       : : "volatile"),
		    2 =&gt; asm!("movw %gs:$1,$0" :
					       "=r" (pfo_ret__) :
					       "*m" (&amp;cpu_number)
					       : : "volatile"),
		    4 =&gt; asm!("movl %gs:$1,$0" :
					       "=r" (pfo_ret__) :
					       "*m" (&amp;cpu_number)
					       : : "volatile"),
		    8 =&gt; asm!("movq %gs:$1,$0" :
					       "=r" (pfo_ret__) :
					       "*m" (&amp;cpu_number)
					       : : "volatile"),
		    _ =&gt; {
			__bad_percpu_size();
		    }
		}
		pfo_ret__
	    })
	}
</code></pre>
<p>C2Rust uses clang as a front-end which currently expands macros very early before parsing,
so modifying it to produce an AST with unexpanded macros would be a significant undertaking.
We are currently considering other alternatives, but it is unclear whether any
of them would be simpler. For the foreseeable future, C2Rust will
not be able to transpile non-trivial function-like C macros to Rust macros.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content"><p>When imitating a real world circuit in the digital world, it is important to consider the quirks and constraints present in hardware components. This article is looking at how a software application can mimic the effects on a signal of an operational amplifier when it reaches saturation.</p><p>The incredibly versatile Operational Amplifier (Op-Amp) has many flaws and caveats that have to be considered in circuit design. When software aims to mimic a hardware design, these imperfections should be considered, and replicated as desired.</p><p>In an ideal world, Operational Amplifiers would be able to output any arbitrary voltages, but in reality they are constrained by their power supply. The peak-to-peak voltage of the outputted signal cannot go higher than the voltage of the power rails; this is called Saturation. In older op-amps, the peak-to-peak voltage of the output signal would be several volts less than the power supplyâ€™s peak-to-peak voltage, though newer op-amps can get closer to the power supply.</p><p>When looking at the datasheet of an Op-Amp, youâ€™ll often see a graph that resembles something like this:</p><p><img src="https://jetholt.com/assets/images/micro/op-amp-ideal-saturation.png" alt="The kind of Op-Amp saturation graph you see in a datasheet or in education."> <em>The kind of Op-Amp saturation graph you see in a datasheet or in education.</em></p><p>This characteristic can be represented like this:</p><p> $$ f(x)=\begin{cases} n &amp;: x \times g \leq n &amp;\text{(negative saturation)}\\ x \times g &amp;: n &lt; x \times g &lt; p &amp;\text{(active/linear region)}\\ p &amp;: x \times g \geq p &amp;\text{(positive saturation)}\\ \end{cases} $$</p><p>where\( \; n = \text{negative saturation voltage}\),\( \; p = \text{positive saturation voltage}\),\( \; x = \text{input signal}\),\( \; g = \text{gain}\).</p><p>In other words, the output of the op-amp is linear in regards to the input whilst between the two saturation thresholds, though once it goes above or below the positive or negative saturation levels, the output matches the saturation level.</p><p>This is an idealised version of a non-ideal op-amp, which is a strange concept. Real Op-Amp saturation doesnâ€™t look like that, nor does an idealised Op-Amp (which wouldnâ€™t saturate at all). This idealised version would be easy for us to simulate without doing any complicated calculation; simply clip at the saturation thresholds.</p><p>In reality, an op-amp has a slight curve as it nears saturation, and it becomes non-linear, similar to the below (which is a little exaggerated):</p><p><img src="https://jetholt.com/assets/images/micro/op-amp-real-saturation.png" alt="A slightly more realistic graph of Op-Amp saturation."> <em>A slightly more realistic graph of Op-Amp saturation.</em></p><p>This is the characteristic that Iâ€™d like to imitate.</p><p>We can tell just by looking at it that it is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function">Sigmoid Function</a> (aka any function with an â€˜Sâ€™ shape.)</p><p>Iâ€™m not an expert mathematician, so Iâ€™ll often do a bit of trial and error with Wolfram Alpha to see if I can nudge an equation closer to what Iâ€™m looking for.</p><p>I eventually turned my attention to the given algebraic function:</p><p><img src="https://jetholt.com/assets/images/micro/op-amp-wiki.png" alt="The graph of the function for n=2, plotted by Wolfram Alpha."> <em>The graph of \(y = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\), plotted by Wolfram Alpha.</em></p><p>It has a fairly lacklustre performance characteristic as written; there is almost no linear region. However, I noticed that if I generalised the formula (ie to the formula below), then as n increased, the characteristic became more like the idealised op-amp saturation characteristic.</p><p><img src="https://jetholt.com/assets/images/micro/op-amp-wiki-modified.png" alt="The graph of the function for n=100, plotted by Wolfram Alpha."> <em>The graph of \(y = \frac{x}{\sqrt[100]{1+x^{100}}}\), plotted by Wolfram Alpha.</em></p><p>The graph above is for \(n = 100\). When I differentiated this function, I saw that yes, the â€˜linear regionâ€™ was actually linear (and not some imperceptible curve):</p><p><img src="https://jetholt.com/assets/images/micro/op-amp-wiki-modified-differentiated.png" alt="The graph of the differential of the function for n=100, plotted by Wolfram Alpha."> <em>First order differential of \(y = \frac{x}{\sqrt[100]{1+x^{100}}}\), plotted by Wolfram Alpha.</em></p><p>I played with the numbers and ended up settling with \(n = 100\). It seemed like a good medium between â€˜not doing anythingâ€™ and â€˜doing too muchâ€™. If I really wanted to I could measure it on an oscilloscope and try to match it exactly, but for me this was good enough.</p><p><img src="https://jetholt.com/assets/images/micro/op-amp-final.png" alt="The graph of the function for n=20, plotted by Wolfram Alpha."> <em>The graph of \(y = \frac{x}{\sqrt[20]{1+x^{20}}}\), plotted by Wolfram Alpha.</em></p><p>To use this in your code, simply rescale your input signal so that the thresholds fall at -1 and 1, pass the rescaled signal through the function (as \(x\)), and then scale back up.</p><p>I did this for a C++ project, so my code looks like this:</p><div><div><pre><code>float saturate(float input, float threshold) {
    float scale = input / threshold;
    return (threshold * scale) / (std::pow(1.f + std::pow(scale,20.f), 1.f/20.f));
}
</code></pre></div></div></div><p id="calltoaction"><em>P.S. I'm late to the party, but I recently got <a href="https://twitter.com/JetroidMakes">a twitter account</a> that you can follow <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=JetroidMakes">here</a>.</em></p></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>Update [2020-07-11]: Due to some feedback on Hackernews about cold-starts, I went ahead and updated the Deno deployment so that it
didn't download dependencies at the start. Please see the <a href="#cold-starts-and-deno">Cold Starts and Deno</a> below. </p>
<p><a href="https://deno.land/">Deno</a> is hot. Aimed to solve some
    of the more painful aspects of Node, Deno has taken the community by storm and a lot
    of people are looking to replace their Node-based workloads.</p>
<p>For me, I mostly use Node for Lambda functions. 
I wanted to see if Deno could replace it. 
Since Deno has a totally different packaging system that means that I have to wait until AWS clients are written or 
write them myself. 
There is a Deno library for <a href="https://deno.land/x/dynamodb">DynamoDB</a>, though.
Combine that with the <a href="https://github.com/hayd/deno-lambda">Lambda Layer</a> that has been created for the community and 
you I could get started easily enough. But, is it good?</p>
<p>Mainly, is it performant? I started by setting up two Lambda functions, one written for Node and one written for Deno.
Each function did the same thing, wrote a DynamoDB record and then read it back. I created a third Lambda, written for 
Node, that would execute the other two Lambdas at a specified rate. I'd then monitor performance.</p>
<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Let's get this out of the way: Node and the AWS SDK are optimized. They've been around for quite a while and have gotten
quite good, as you will soon see. Deno and the library used here have probably not undergone the same level of optimization.
That being said, I still wanted to find out if it's worth adopting right now.</p>
<h2 id="the-test">The Test</h2>
<p>I ran the tester Lambda, asking for 5 minutes of calls every 500ms. I assumed that this would allow the runtimes to 'settle' 
after the cold-start and I could see representative duration metrics. This was my primary concern: <strong>what's the p99 duration
of the Lambda function execution</strong>.</p>
<p>The results are largely what I expected:</p>
<p><img src="https://matthewbonig.com/posts/images/node-vs-deno/results.png" alt="Duration Comparisons"></p>
<p>The Node lambda would execute around 40ms, which is quite solid. This was with the 
<strong><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/node-reusing-connections.html">AWS_NODEJS_CONNECTION_REUSE_ENABLED</a></strong>
environment variable. Init durations were around 350ms. Increasing memory to 1024 didn't improve either metric signficanly.</p>
<p>The Deno lambda averaged a <strong>250ms</strong> duration. Worse, the init durations were in the <strong>3.5s</strong> range. The main reason for 
this is the Deno runtime currently downloads external packages on cold-start. There are probably some mechanisms to speed 
this up, but that's for another post. </p>

<p>So, obviously, this is bad. Getting a 6x increase in moving from Node to Deno is not real appealing.  But, does this 
mean Deno shouldn't be adopted?</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-and-thoughts">Conclusion and Thoughts</h2>
<p>Deno is hot. And for good reason. If you've ever worked with Node and the <code>node_modules</code> directory you've probably
dealt with a packaging system that has a lot to be desired. Additionally, it's pretty insecure by default, allowing any
codebase full access to the file system and network. This has been a 
<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-spots-malicious-npm-package-stealing-data-from-unix-systems/">recurring</a>
<a href="https://snyk.io/blog/malicious-code-found-in-npm-package-event-stream/">problem</a>, usually requiring tools and diligent
maintainers to catch problems after they've occurred. Deno aimed to solve both of these problems with a de-centralized
package ecosystem and a safe-by-default runtime, requiring 
<a href="https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/permissions">explicit parameters</a>
to enable access to the network and file system. Oh, and let's not forget 1st class 
<a href="https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/typescript">Typescript support</a>!</p>
<p>So, with these numbers, is Deno ready? For API Gateway integration, I'd say no. The cold-start and runtime performance
just isn't there yet for backing client-facing API calls. But, what about other situations? Backing API Gateway isn't the
only use-case for Deno. In a lot of cases Lambda functions are used for listening to event streams, responding to Step
Function calls, or just a nightly background data processing process. In those cases, having a slower runtime may not be
an issue (other than the additional billing costs). And, this is where a microservice architecture and highly decoupled
systems really shines. You could easily adopt Deno for a few functions that don't need low latency; get used to the runtime
and flesh out your development pipeline around it with low risk to your overall project (if it doesn't work, it's hopefully
small enough you can just re-implement with Node).</p>
<p>Personally, I'm really excited about Deno. Node has baggage and some of that baggage is not easy to carry. It took 
years before Node was ready for production and adopted in those environments. Thanks to a vastly different landscape
now, I think Deno will be in production much quicker. As such, jump in now where you can and get used to it, cause if you're
running Node now I'm willing to bet you'll be running Deno in some capacity in 2 years.</p>
<h2 id="code">Code</h2>
<p>Btw, if you'd like the code so you can run these tests yourself, they're available <a href="https://github.com/mbonig/node-vs-deno">here</a>,
as (what else?!) a CDK module.</p>
<h2 id="cold-starts-and-deno">Cold Starts and Deno</h2>
<p>Someone posted this blog to Hackernews and many comments were around not bundling the dependencies. So, I went back and
bundled them. The results are a little bit shocking.</p>
<p>First, here is an example of the logs of a cold-start without bundling:</p>

      <section id="main_content">
        
<p>Hello chaps, I am the QuanticDev, a senior software engineer. I have started my development career with Windows back in middle school. I mostly did PHP back then, along with some basic C/C++ using Borland C++ Builder 6, and it worked out great! However, since then, Windows became the underdog of software development. With the power of free and open-source software, Linux has taken over the server world. The easiest way to write server-side apps that target Linux is to use a Unix based system like macOS or Linux, and not Windows! In addition, Windows never had a great package manager. There were attempts like Chocolatey or Scoop, but they are no match to Homebrew on macOS or tens of different package managers found on Linux systems. Now that we have the second version of Windows Subsystem for Linux, as well as the shiny new Windows Package Manager called “winget”, did the tables turn? Let’s find out.</p>

<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<p>You can find the video narration of this article on YouTube: Part #1 - GitHub Advantages, Alternatives, and Setup: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnHGGmLMKO0" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnHGGmLMKO0</a></p>

</ul>

<p>My separate <a href="https://quanticdev.com/articles/manjaro-linux-productivity-machine" target="_blank">Cleanest Linux Productivity and Development Environment using Manjaro Linux</a> article also referred to in this article.</p>

<h2 id="windows-package-manager-winget">Windows Package Manager (winget)</h2>
<p><strong>Tip: Next two section are transcripts from my live demonstrations of them. If you want to watch it, the link to the video is in resources section above.</strong></p>

<p>Before anything, you might remember that in my “Cleanest Linux Productivity and Development Environment using Manjaro Linux” article, I heavily criticized Window for not having a native package manager and not having access to essential utilities like Bash and other Unix tools. Now that Windows 10 May 2020 update is out, we can test and see if the situation is better. So, let’s start by installing the new Windows Package Manager; winget. It is open-source and is hosted on GitHub, so I will head over to its GitHub page. It appears that the future versions of Windows will have it pre-installed, but for now, I will manually install it. Once the installation is done, I will search for some developer tools to install. I’ll start by searching for Node.js. Searching for packages is easy but installing them is a bit quirky. You need to use the package ID instead of the package name. Once the Node.js package is installed, you will be greeted by the next quirk. The “node” command will not be available in your current PowerShell window. You will have to close it and open a new one to get “node” command to work.</p>

<p>Now let’s go ahead and check if all the essential packages necessary for development are available in winget repositories. Go programming language is there. Python 3.8 is also in the repos. But I realize that they only have the latest versions and not the older but still supported ones. This is a deal-breaker for me since my projects routinely depend on certain versions of programming language tools. If winget does not add this feature, I would have to maintain versions manually.</p>

<p>I can also see that Chrome, DropBox, and Firefox are also in the winget repos. However, I cannot find IntelliJ, which is one of my favorite code editors. The winget GitHub page has a link to “winget-pkgs” repo which contains all current and candidate winget packages. <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/pull/179" target="_blank">I can see that there is a discussion going on in the issue tracker to add IntelliJ to the repos</a>, which is good. There seems to be a ton of activity in winget-pkgs repo which means there are a ton of new packages added daily, and many other being updated.</p>

<h2 id="windows-subsystem-for-linux-2-wsl-2">Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL 2)</h2>
<p>Now that we investigated the new Windows Package Manager, I want to test the new Windows Subsystem for Linux, version 2. I will simply follow the command line instructions from WSL 2 website. It comes with an updated Linux kernel and has a bunch of other improvements. There is an open-source project on GitHub to bring Arch Linux to WSL, so I will go ahead and install it. Arch and Arch-based Manjaro Linux are my favorite Linux distros, so having direct access to them from Windows is a major stepping stone for me. WSL 2 uses a highly optimized virtualization engine with Hyper-V. WSL 2 boots to the Arch command line in less than a second on my machine! We seem to be the root user in the terminal so let’s go ahead and install Node.js and npm so that we can compare the package installation process with Windows. The installation is quick. It seems that file system performance is near-native. This is a huge improvement over WSL version 1.</p>

<p>We have all our development tools ready both in Arch Linux Subsystem and on our host Windows system. I will go ahead and clone my open-source “js-api” project from my GitHub account to this machine. Once it is cloned, I will do “npm install” to install all missing packages and start my js-api server using “npm start”. Thanks to having a fast SSD, everything is decently quick and seems to work well. I will repeat the same task on Arch, but with one of my even bigger (however unmaintained) open-source projects: KOAN.js. This project has both frontend and backend packages, so if there is any slowness in I/O operations, we should observe it. Even with substantially more dependencies, “npm install” is again as quick as it was on Windows. This tells me that both disk and network performance are near-native inside WSL 2 virtual machines.</p>

<h2 id="downsides-of-wsl-and-winget">Downsides of WSL and winget</h2>
<p>Even though winget in combination with WSL 2 + Arch is looking good, it is not all sunshine and rainbows. First off, winget does not have dependency management. This means that it just downloads and executes .exe files. Though dependency management is on their roadmap.</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/is-windows-good-for-developers/images/winget-dependency-management.png" alt="winget Dependency Management"></p>

<p>In addition, you can only find the latest versions of packages, and not the older stable ones. This might be a deal-breaker for many developers that want to pin their systems to specific versions of development tools.</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/is-windows-good-for-developers/images/winget-package-versions.png" alt="winget Package Versions"></p>

<p>In addition, WSL’s distro selection is very limited. Though, WSL 2 switched to a fully flagged virtual machine approach, so I assume that the situation will improve over time.</p>

<h2 id="is-window-with-wsl-2-and-winget-a-worthy-developer-os">Is Window with WSL 2 and winget a Worthy Developer OS?</h2>
<p>The answer is: not yet, but we are getting there. Both the new package manager and Linux subsystem are missing important functionality. But their roadmaps look bright. I understand that developers that are moving towards the business management side of things need Windows, mostly due to the business world’s dependency on Microsoft Office. If you are on that boat, I would say investing in a Windows laptop and doing occasional programming on it using the Linux subsystem is an acceptable compromise. If you do not need the full Microsoft Office experience on native Windows, I still strongly recommend Manjaro Linux. Both for general productivity tasks and software development, it offers a near-perfect experience. If you want to check my dedicated article on it, the link is in the resources section above.</p>

<p>And that is about it for now. If there are worthy updates to WSL and winget in the future, I will review them again and write an updated article. I am planning to buy a compact Windows machine, maybe an Asus PN50 Mini PC with AMD Ryzen 7 4700U, to use it as my Premiere renderer machine. If I get one, I will set up QEMU + Arch Linux and compare it to WSL 2 workflow and let you guys know. If you want to check out the updates, you can follow me on Twitter or on YouTube.</p>

July 10, 2020 | https://microtica.com/the-concept-of-domain-driven-design-explained/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://microtica.com/the-concept-of-domain-driven-design-explained/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div>
<p>Using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/microservices/">microservices</a> means <strong>creating applications from loosely coupling services</strong>. The application consists of several small services, each representing a separate business goal. <a href="https://microtica.com/deploy-your-first-microservice-on-kubernetes-in-10-mins/">They can be developed and easily maintained individually</a>, after what they are joint in a complex application.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Microservices is an architecture design model with a <strong>specific bounded context, configuration, and dependencies. </strong>These result from the architectural principles of the domain-driven design and DevOps. <strong>Domain-driven design is the idea of solving problems of the organization through code.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The business goal is important to the business users, with a <strong>clear interface and functions</strong>. This way, the microservice can run independently from other microservices. Moreover, the team can also work on it independently, which is, in fact, the point of the microservice architecture.</p>



<p>Many developers claim microservices have made them more efficient. This is due to the ability to work in small teams. This allows them to develop different small parts that will later be merged as a large app. </p>



<p>They spend less time coordinating with other developers and more time on developing the actual code. Eventually, this creates more value for the end-user.</p>



<h2>The Complexity Challenge</h2>



<p>Complexity is a relative term. What’s complex for one person is simple for another. However, <strong>complexity is the problem that domain-driven design should solve</strong>. In this context, complexity means interconnectedness, many different data sources, different business goals, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The domain-driven approach is here to solve the complexity of software development. On the other hand, you can use emergent design when the challenge is simple. However, when your application is complex, the complexity will only grow, and so will your problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Domain-driven design bases on the business domain. </strong>Modern business environments are very complex and wrong moves can lead to fatal outcomes. Domain-driven design solves complex domain models, connecting to the core business concepts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eric Evans, introduced the concept in 2004, in his book <em>Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software</em>. According to the book, it focuses on three principles:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>The primary focus of the project is the core <strong>domain </strong>and <strong>domain logic.</strong></li><li>Complex designs are based on <strong>models of the domain.</strong></li><li>Collaboration between technical and <strong>domain experts </strong>is crucial to creating an application model that will solve particular domain problems.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2>Important terms in Domain-Driven Design</h2>



<p>In DDD, it’s important to pay attention to the following terms:&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Domain logic</h4>



<p>Domain logic<strong> </strong>is <strong>the purpose of your modeling</strong>. Most commonly, it’s referred to as the <strong>business logic. </strong>This is where your business rules define the way data gets created, stored, and modified.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Domain model</h4>



<p>Domain model includes the <strong>ideas, knowledge, data, metrics, and goals</strong> that revolve around that problem you’re trying to solve. It contains all the rules and patterns that will help you deal with complex business logic. Moreover, they will be useful to meet the requirements of your business.</p>



<h4>Subdomain</h4>



<p>A domain consists of several subdomains<strong> </strong>that refer to <strong>different parts of the business logic</strong>. For example, an online retail store could have a product catalog, inventory, and delivery as its subdomains.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Design patterns</h4>



<p>Design patterns<strong> </strong>are all about <strong>reusing code</strong>. No matter the complexity of the problem you encounter, someone who’s been doing object-oriented programming has probably already created a pattern that will help you solve it. Breaking down your problem into its initial elements will lead you to its solution. Everything you learn through patterns, you can later use for any object-oriented language you start to program in.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Bounded context</h4>



<p>Bounded context is a <strong>central pattern</strong> in domain-driven design that contains the complexity of the application. It handles large models and teams. This is where you implement the code, after you’ve defined the <strong>domain </strong>and the <strong>subdomains.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Bounded contexts actually represent <strong>boundaries in which a certain subdomain is defined and applicable.</strong> Here, the specific subdomain makes sense, while others don’t. One entity can have different names in different contexts. When a subdomain within the bounded context changes, the entire system doesn’t have to change too. That’s why developers use adapters between contexts.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>The Ubiquitous Language</h4>



<p>The Ubiquitous Language is a methodology that refers to <strong>the same language domain experts and developers use when they talk about the domain they are working on.</strong> This is necessary because projects can face serious issues with a disrupted language. This happens because domain experts use their own jargon. At the same time, tech professionals use their own terms to talk about the domain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s a gap between the terminology used in daily discussions and the terms used in the code. That’s why it’s necessary to define a set of terms that everyone uses. All the terms in the ubiquitous language are structured around the domain model.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Entities</h4>



<p>Entities are a combination of <strong>data and behavior</strong>, like a user or a product. They have identity, but represent data points with behavior.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Value objects and aggregates</h4>



<p>Value objects <strong>have attributes</strong>, but can’t exist on their own. For example, the shipping address can be a value object. Large and complicated systems have countless entities and value objects. That’s why the domain model needs some kind of structure. This will put them into logical groups that will be easier to manage. These groups are called <strong>aggregates. </strong>They represent a collection of objects that are connected to each other, with the goal to treat them as units. Moreover, they also have an <strong>aggregate root. </strong>This is the only entity that any object outside of the aggregate can reference to.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Domain service</h4>



<p>The domain service is <strong>an additional layer that also contains domain logic</strong>.  It’s part of the domain model, just like entities and value objects. At the same time, the <strong>application service </strong>is another layer that doesn’t contain business logic. However, it’s here to coordinate the activity of the application, placed above the domain model.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Repository</h4>



<p>The repository pattern is a <strong>collection of business entities</strong> that simplifies the data infrastructure. It releases the domain model from infrastructure concerns. The <strong>layering </strong>concept enforces the separation of concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Example of Domain-Driven Design</h2>



<figure><img src="https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topac-01-1024x549.png" alt="Example of domain-driven design" srcset="https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topac-01-1024x549.png 1024w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topac-01-300x161.png 300w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topac-01-768x411.png 768w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topac-01-740x396.png 740w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topac-01.png 1400w" sizes="100vw"></figure>



<p>If we take an e-commerce app, for example, the business domain would be to process an order. When a customer wants to place an order, they first need to go through the products. Then, they choose their desired ones, confirm the order, choose shipping type, and pay. The app then processes the data the client provides.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, a user app would consist of the following layers:&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>User Interface</strong></h4>



<p>This is where the customer can find <strong>all the information needed to place an order</strong>. In an e-commerce case, this is where the products are. This layer presents the information to the client and interprets their actions.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Application layer</strong></h4>



<p>This layer doesn’t contain business logic. It’s the part that <strong>leads the user from one to another UI screen</strong>. It also interacts with application layers of other systems. It can perform simple validation but it contains no domain-related logic or data access. Its purpose is to organize and delegate domain objects to do their job. Moreover, it’s the only layer accessible to other bounded contexts.</p>



<h4><strong>Domain layer</strong></h4>



<p>This is where the <strong>concepts of the business domain </strong>are. This layer has all the information about the business case and the business rules. Here’s where the <strong>entities </strong>are. As we mentioned earlier, entities<strong> </strong>are a combination of data and behavior, like a user or a product.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They have a unique identity guaranteed via a unique key and remains even when their attributes change. For example, in an e-commerce store, every order has a unique identifier. It has to go through several actions like confirming and shipping to be considered as an entity.</p>



<p>On the other hand, <strong>value objects</strong> don’t have unique identifiers. They represent attributes that various entities can share. For example, this could be the same last name of different customers.</p>



<p>This part also contains services with <strong>defined operational behavior</strong> that don’t have to be a part of any domain. However, they are still part of the business domain. The services are named according to the ubiquitous language. They shouldn’t deprive entities and value objects of their clear accountability and actions. Customers should be able to use any given service instance. The history of that instance during the lifetime of the application shouldn’t be a problem.</p>



<p>Most importantly, the domain layer is in the center of the business application. This means that it should be separated from the rest of the layers. It shouldn’t depend on the other layers or their frameworks.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Infrastructure layer</strong></h4>



<p>This layer <strong>supports communication between other layers</strong> and can contain supporting libraries for the UI layer.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Advantages of Domain-Driven Design</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Simpler communication. </strong>Thanks to the Ubiquitous  Language, communication between developers and teams becomes much easier. As the ubiquitous language is likely to contain simpler terms developers refer to, there’s no need for complicated technical terms.</li><li><strong>More flexibility. </strong>As DDD is object-oriented, everything about the domain is based on and object is modular and caged. Thanks to this, the entire system can be modified and improved regularly.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The domain is more important than UI/UX. </strong>As the domain is the central concept, developers will build applications suited for the particular domain.  This won’t be another interface-focused application. Although you shouldn’t leave out UX, using the DDD approach means that the product targets exactly the users that are directly connected to the domain.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <div>
        <div id="markdown" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>I recently published a warts-and-all 4 part introduction (covering <a href="https://terminusdb.com/2019/09/20/graph-fundamentals-part-1-rdf/">RDF</a>, <a href="https://terminusdb.com/2019/09/25/graph-fundamentals-part-2-labelled-property-graphs/">Property Graphs</a>, <a href="https://terminusdb.com/2020/02/25/graph-fundamentals-part-4-linked-data/">Graph Schemas</a> and <a href="https://terminusdb.com/2020/02/25/graph-fundamentals-part-4-linked-data/">Linked Data</a>). You would be forgiven for concluding that I am not a fan of Graph databases or RDF. One reader on Twitter even accused me of “shitting on RDF”(!).</p>

<p>It’s important to be frank about the problems of graphs and RDF and not just whistle the marketing tune because as soon as the technology is out there in the hands of developers, they <em>will</em> find the problems and will be inclined to reject the technology as pure hype if all they have heard are songs of breathless wonder. In the last couple of years, while trying to sell graph databases into bricks and mortar companies, by far the most hostile reactions I’ve come across have been from technologists who got bitten by the Semantic Web bug in the early 2000s. Once bitten twice shy.</p>

<p>However, if you were to assume that I’m a critic of graph databases, you would be very wrong. I’ve spent most of the last decade building graph database management systems because to me it’s incredibly obvious that in the long run graph is going to win and here’s why.</p>

<hr>

<p>The point of all databases is to provide as accurate a representation of some aspect of external reality as possible.</p>

<p>The fundamental advantage of graph databases is that they model the world as things that have properties and relationships with other things.</p>

<p>This is closer to the way that humans perceive the world — mapping between whatever aspect of external reality you are interested in and the data model is an order of magnitude easier than with relational databases. Everything is pre-joined — you don’t have to disassemble objects into normalised tables and reassemble them with joins.</p>

<p>And because creating and curating large and complex datasets is very difficult, very expensive and potentially very lucrative, the reduction in technical complexity in creating and interpreting the graph data model is irresistible. The knowledge graphs that companies like Google and Facebook have accumulated are demonstrably commercially powerful and it is unlikely that such complex and rich datasets would have been possible without graph.</p>

<p>Humans have an evolutionarily pragmatic view of the world. We perceive the world as things that move through space and time. These things have properties which may change over time. They also have relationships with other things which may also change over time.</p>

<p>The model is simple but there are a great many different types of things — from stones, to mirrors to politicians and honeybees. To make sense of these things and their properties, we organise them into types and organise these types into a ‘tree-of-life’ or more broadly a ‘tree-of-things’ —taxonomies of types of things that share certain properties and relationships with other types of things.</p>

<p>Whether you are building a database to record the known universe or logging network security incidents, the model that you actually want to record is always a bunch of objects, categorised with a type-taxonomy, with properties and relationships with other objects, some of which change over time. That’s what you always want to record, because that’s how you perceive the world. Any indirection between perceived world and recorded model creates extra complexity at every step of processing. And in the world of complex systems, combinatorial explosion of complexity is the one true enemy. Reducing the complexity in each and every data operation is irresistible in the long run — you can focus on other things rather than the mappings between the aspects of the real world that you want to model and their stored representations.</p>

<p>In this respect, even the simplest graph database such as Neo4j — which models the world as a bunch of JSON documents, some of which may contain pointers to other JSON documents, is much better than even the fanciest RDBMS. Granted there is no taxonomy or schema, and support for temporality is basic, but it’s easy to produce a much more naturalistic model of the world than will ever be possible if you have to break the things up into relations. Of course it is possible to automate this mapping by delegating the problem to code (for example by using ORMs or system meta-models) but this is a short-term fix that blows up as size and complexity increase. Code has unbounded complexity and is largely opaque to automated analysis —its contribution to combinatorial explosion becomes overwhelming at scale. All systems which are built upon ORMs evolve into ORM maintenance systems.</p>

<p>The diagram below shows how different database technologies rank in terms of their data-modelling power — the extent to which they allow you to create naturalistic models of the world. To briefly explain the categories:</p>

<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2540/1*qa--bW5-ntB1BRuCcigiYQ.png" alt="comparing databases">
Databases ranked by data modelling power with leading open source examples of each type (in database land, if you are not open source, you have no long term future )</p>

<h2 id="key-value-stores-and-wide-column-stores">Key Value Stores and Wide Column Stores</h2>

<p>These databases exist primarily to provide computer programs with somewhere to save the variables that they use — they lack data-modelling features beyond basic datatypes. There is nothing wrong with this — computer programs need databases too. It is also, of course, possible to assemble complex data-models from these atomic units within programs, but this very quickly runs into the combinatorial explosion problem — almost everything is described in code leading to unbridled complexity growth.</p>

<h2 id="document-stores">Document Stores</h2>

<p>Document stores typically store data as a set of JSON documents —objects with tree-structures. The big feature of these databases over relational is that these documents are suitable for creating naturalistic models of things, with the tree structure expressing a containment (or has-a) relationship type. However, they are severely crippled because of poor support for modelling relationships — document relations are often expressed through embedding duplicates of other documents — a horrible, awful, solution which massively increases complexity over time.</p>

<h2 id="relational-databases">Relational Databases</h2>

<p>Relational databases are all about relations — tables that can be joined together to formed new relations. Foreign keys are used to express schematic relationships between tables. These relationships are untyped and semantically meaningless integers or strings are commonly used as keys. As a result relational databases are fairly impoverished in terms of their abilities to capture real world relationships — we can’t distinguish between containment (has-a) and other types of relationships so we can’t actually turn these relations back into objects without information that is external to the system — mostly in glue code or ORMs. Furthermore, translating to and from these relations and real world objects is rather intricate and leads to a very complex data model even for relatively simple aspects of the real world.</p>

<h2 id="property-graphs">Property Graphs</h2>

<p>Property graphs are basically document stores with a dash of relations added in that is to say, they are just a bunch of JSONs with some properties acting as special links to other JSONs (the in and out properties of edges). Even though they are quite primitive, they still have the most important features needed to create naturalistic models of the real world — things (nodes) with properties and relationships (edges).</p>

<h2 id="rdf-graphs">RDF Graphs</h2>

<p>RDF graphs have all of the features of the database models to the left, the thing that they really bring to the party is the concept of object types — via the <em>rdf:type</em> predicate — and not just simple datatypes.</p>

<h2 id="owl-graphs">OWL Graphs</h2>

<p>Graph databases that use the Web Ontology Language (OWL) to describe their data model are by far the most powerful in terms of data modelling capabilities, although OWL must be used with care as it can easily lead to an incomprehensibly complex data model (and in practice we need to choose a computable fragment of the language). Nevertheless, the really important aspects can be boiled down to 3 simple predicates that enable relationships between object types to be defined — <em>rdfs:domain</em> and <em>rdfs:range</em> support strongly typed relationships between objects, not just simple relationships, while <em>rdfs:subClassOf</em> supports type inheritance — and hence proper taxonomies — these combine to provide a fully featured type system, the holy grail of data modelling.</p>

<hr>

<p>So, while some people may feel that recent interest in graph databases is just another fad, I’m putting my money on graph — 20 years from now, non-graph databases will be niche and legacy applications.</p>

Let me first elaborate a little further why you would want to apply the tips and tricks from this blog post.</p><p>Git has become the de-facto standard of vcs over the past few years. You are probably using it for all your software development projects, and maybe even for your web blog, when you are blogging in markdown using a static site generator.</p><p>You also might be using Nodejs, python or other programming languages which are easier to run on Linux. Probably you have been using a Virtualbox VM or you are deploying your solutions in the cloud. The last thing you want is entering your password each time you connect to the VM via PuTTY. Or when you are trying to send some file to the VM using for example WinSCP.</p><p>Furthermore I usually use <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vagrant</a> for my VM’s. Using the setup below will improve my experience.</p><p>This blogpost will help you putting the settings in place so you only have to enter your ssh-key’s password only once. No matter what tool you are using following settings will apply to all of them when they use an ssh key to authenticate.</p><p>Prerequisites:</p><ul><li>Git (Git-extensions)</li><li>PuTTY</li><li>Puttygen (comes with Git-extensions)</li></ul><h2 id="Generate-a-SSH-key"><a href="#Generate-a-SSH-key" title="Generate a SSH key"></a>Generate a SSH key</h2><p>In order to generate an ssh key you can simply use <code>ssh-keygen.exe</code> which can be found in your Git installation directory in the <code>bin</code> folder. It is mandatory you name the keys exactly as in this blog post, since open_ssh will look for them using those names.</p><p>Open your <code>Git Bash</code> and execute following commands to generate your <code>open-ssh</code> key. Make sure you put a strong password on the key when prompted. This makes sure no one can use your key when you accidentally loose it somewhere.</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br><span>8</span><br><span>9</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C <span>"your@email.domain"</span></span><br><span>Generating public/private rsa key pair.</span><br><span>Enter file <span>in</span> <span>which</span> to save the key (/c/Users/Marco/.ssh/id_rsa):</span><br><span>Enter passphrase (empty <span>for</span> no passphrase):</span><br><span>Enter same passphrase again:</span><br><span>Your identification has been saved <span>in</span> ~/.ssh/id_rsa.</span><br><span>Your public key has been saved <span>in</span> ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.</span><br><span>The key fingerprint is:</span><br><span>30:a5:c1:7a:bb:00:bf:7c:24:b7:4d:f1:d6:3d:e5:7e your@email.domain</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>We have just generated a key pair using 4096 bit encryption. PuTTY does not natively support the generated private key. Next step is to create a private PuTTY ssh key. This can be done using <code>puttygen.exe</code> which can be found in your <code>Git-extensions</code> installation directory or your putty installation directory. Open <code>puttygen.exe</code> by double clicking the executable and import your open-ssh key using the conversion menu as shown in following screenshot.<br><img src="https://marcofranssen.nl/images/fd197b4bbfc7467708b54cbeab2977214fb1e195.jpg" alt="Puttygen convert Open-SSH"><br>Then save the private key as <code>id_rsa.ppk</code> in the same folder as your <code>open-ssh</code> public and private key. Again don’t forget to put a password on the key (ideally the same as on your open-ssh key for your own convenience).</p><p>Now we have the ssh keys in place to be able to setup ssh connections either via <code>Bash</code> (id_rsa) or via <code>PuTTY</code> (id_rsa.ppk). The only problem is we have to enter the password each time in <code>bash</code> and we have to manually load the <code>PuTTY</code> key in <code>pageant.exe</code>.</p><h2 id="Pageant"><a href="#Pageant" title="Pageant"></a>Pageant</h2><p>The <code>Pageant</code> program that was installed as part of the <code>PuTTY</code> package, can store your keys and give them to <em>mRemote</em>, <em>WinSCP</em> and <em>PuTTY</em> as required. You can open <code>pageant.exe</code> and load your <code>id_rsa.ppk</code> key manually and provide the password. From now on <em>PuTTY</em>, <em>WinSCP</em> and any program that serves as a fronted for them (like <em>mRemote</em>) will first consult with the Pageant program if there is a key to use for the connection.</p><p>You might want to load this key automatically at startup. This can easily be done by using one of the following methods:</p><ol><li>Assuming you’ve allowed Pageant to take over the <code>ppk</code> suffix, you should be able to simply add the key files to the Windows “startup” folder.</li><li>Create a shortcut to the program that passes the key-files as parameters.

<p lang="pl"><strong>No, this article is not about some novel machine learning techniques, but it does cover the part of preparing a down to earth “<em>learning</em> <em>model</em>“.</strong></p>
<h2 id="ftoc-heading-1">Countless benefits of learning</h2>
<p>“<em>Leaders in every sector seem to agree: Learning is an imperative, not a cliché. Without it, careers derail and companies fail<sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_8268_1" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_8268_1');">[1]</sup><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_8268_1">Petriglieri, G.

<p>During our lifespan, we regularly study new technical or lexical skills for different projects, and this is what we’ll look at – the way to enhance capabilities of the human brain.</p>
<p>Lifelong learning has dozens of benefits, and it’s not only increasing our value on the job market. According to the article from Harvard Business Review<sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_8268_2" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_8268_2');">[2]</sup><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_8268_2">Coleman, J.

(2015) ‘Mental and Social Activity Delays the Symptoms of Alzheimer’s’. [10 June 2015] available from &lt;<a href="https://time.com/3916777/alzheimers-symptoms-delay/">https://time.com/3916777/alzheimers-symptoms-delay/</a>&gt;</span>. Although it requires us to dedicate some of our time to stay alone with our studying material, in the long term, we benefit from open doors to more social circles.</p>
<p>When we learn new stuff, mixing different approaches is a great strategy to stimulate our brain with more stimuli:</p>
<ol>
<li>Analogy – tell me what it’s like</li>
<li>Diagram – help me visualise it</li>
<li>Example – allow me to experience it</li>
<li>Plain English – describe it with everyday words</li>
<li>Technical definition – discuss the formal details.</li>
</ol>
<p>Nevertheless, in this post, we will focus on a technique of digital flashcards that can embrace all the 5 methodologies and remind us of them in the right (algorithmically calculated) time.</p>
<h3 id="ftoc-heading-2">Spaced repetition vs cramming</h3>
<p>If I would tell you right now that in the next month there is an important exam coming on, how would you prepare yourself to it? I assume that you would take your time and by the very last week apply the stressful cramming technique – absorbing large amounts of information in a short period, and eventually forgetting all the material a few weeks after.</p>
<p>Therefore, what is the more effective method that you can apply for the upcoming tests? Thanks to the concept of learning from flashcards, we can implement the two excellent systems of spaced repetition and active recall. Here, you become more prepared for your next exam and achieve a higher recall as the time passes.</p>
<p>Classically, there is no spaced repetition post without the forgetting curve, which shows how you can lose newly learned information if you don’t attempt to retain it:</p>
<figure id="attachment_3488" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3488"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/pawelcislo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ebbinghaus_curve.png?resize=592%2C411&amp;ssl=1" alt="Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve" width="592" height="411" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/pawelcislo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ebbinghaus_curve.png?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i2.wp.com/pawelcislo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ebbinghaus_curve.png?resize=300%2C208&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3488">Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the latter (active recall) technique, we’re actively stimulating memory during the learning process. It contrasts with reading or watching information – passive review method.</p>
<p>Nowadays, using digital software, you can apply these methodologies while reviewing flashcards in synchronisation with your smartphone and PC. The SM-2 algorithm implemented in the software automatically calculates and proposes the time of next reviews so that you can only focus on the one thing.</p>
<p>Spaced repetition on its own is mostly used by medical students such as <a href="https://youtu.be/W-EpiaPcgTk">Ali Abdaal</a> (Cambridge University medicine graduate), but also by programmers such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urUZUWoTLo">Derek Banas</a> or <a href="https://youtu.be/fPDy_qY1v1o">Daniel Bourke</a>.</p>
<p>As such, why spaced repetition isn’t more popular over cramming? Well, people don’t know about it, and it’s not as straightforward in its use. We talk big about self-improvement but don’t want to do any stinkin’ hard work. Can you imagine a student who wants to type his notes back home into a flashcard app?</p>

<h2 id="ftoc-heading-3">What can you study with flashcards?</h2>
<p>Let me start with the fact that the use of a Spaced Repetitive Software (SRS) like Anki can be your greatest weapon while preparing for a TV shows like “<em>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</em>” or “<em>Jeopardy!</em>“, where one player won almost $300 000<sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_8268_4" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_8268_4');">[4]</sup><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_8268_4">Haviland, L. (2020) ‘“Jeopardy!” Champion Arthur Chu’s Old-Fashioned Strategy For Winning Paid Off Big Time’. [26 June 2020] available from &lt;<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/jeopardy-champion-arthur-chus-old-fashioned-strategy-for-winning-paid-off-big-time.html/">https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/jeopardy-champion-arthur-chus-old-fashioned-strategy-for-winning-paid-off-big-time.html/</a>&gt;</span>.</p>
<p>When it comes to me, If I am not mistaken, I started using Anki about a year ago, and it definitely wasn’t consistent. Since then, I created a few decks (entire flashcard collections), but most of them were imported not only from the AnkiWeb but Quizlet and Memrise.</p>
<p>So far, the cards let me:</p>
<ul>
<li>improve my French (especially the cards based on the translation of sentences, not just pure words)</li>
<li>become more fluent with RegEx</li>
<li>learn Greek letters</li>
<li>practice Google Search Operators</li>
<li>relearn Polish voivodeships and the global geography</li>
<li>improve my understanding of Machine Learning theory (huge thanks to the <a href="https://machinelearningflashcards.com/">deck by Chris Albon</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn’t pay too much attention yet to the math or programming cards, but for now, I prefer to learn those topics from the online courses/books and then eventually facilitate them with the flashcards. Nonetheless, if you are wondering how flashcard can teach you programming, I would say that there are 3 main ways (types of cards):</p>
<ul>
<li>for me, the most enjoyable programming decks are showing a code on the front card, and then your objective is to guess what is its output (or maybe there is an error). An example deck: <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/51975584" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc noreferrer">Python code quiz</a></li>
<li>some present an objective on the front side, such as “<em>What is the syntax to print your name</em>“, and the back side reveals “<code>print("your name")</code>“. An example deck:&nbsp;<a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1394656023" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc noreferrer">Python programming from Brian Spiering</a></li>
<li>other decks like&nbsp;<a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1021974894" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc noreferrer">Think Python Vocabulary</a>&nbsp;will teach you more theory. For example, the front side will say “<em>Define: Source Code</em>“, and the answer will be “<em>A program in a high-level language before being compiled</em>“.</li>
</ul>
<p>Surely there are more applications of Anki, which I recently discussed in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/gtjyos/my_current_main_decks_what_are_yours/">Reddit post</a> and brought up an engaging discourse of 93 comments.</p>
<h3 id="ftoc-heading-4">The “<em>magic</em>” behind the SM-2 algorithm</h3>
<p>The SM-2 algorithm from the late 1980s is responsible in Anki for its core function of scheduling your repetitions, with the modification of considering each card’s priority.</p>
<p>Briefly speaking, Anki determines card scheduling by the option we choose after revealing the answer (“<em>Again</em>“, “<em>Hard</em>“, “<em>Good</em>” or “<em>Easy</em>“).&nbsp; Depending on the selected option (our familiarity with the card), the following formula applies different <code>ease%</code> and <code>interval modifier</code>:</p>
<p><span data-display="true">New \ Interval = current \ interval \times ease\% \times interval \ modifier</span></p><p>Watching this great explanation will further and more intuitively illustrate how your use of SRS spaces the next reviews. I also recommend applying settings recommended by its author (presented in the form of screenshots at 07:31 and 12:34).</p>

<p>Another strong point of Anki is its way of providing us with lots of statistics, where some are summarised in the form of histograms. There I’ve got a sample estimation of the number of cards that I’m likely to study in the next 30 days of my French set.</p>

<p>I know such dull explanations of spaced repetition can be tiresome, but luckily there are interactive simulations in your browser to help with that. For that, there is nothing better than Nicky’s blog post: “<a href="https://ncase.me/remember/">How To Remember Anything Forever-Ish</a>“.</p>
<h2 id="ftoc-heading-5">Setting up Anki</h2>
<p>At first, the use of this software won’t be the most straightforward in comparison to <a href="https://pawelcislo.com/2020/07/10/optimising-our-learning-retention-rate-with-srs-anki/#ftoc-heading-14">its alternatives</a>, but as we know, there are no ideal solutions. In this section, I’ll provide you with the information that will save you lots of time to start your first studying session.</p>
<h3 id="ftoc-heading-6">Quick installation guide</h3>
<ol>
<li>Create your&nbsp;<a href="https://ankiweb.net/account/register" rel="nofollow">AnkiWeb account</a>.</li>
<li>Download&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/#download" rel="nofollow">Anki desktop application</a>&nbsp;(Windows/Mac/Linux).</li>
<li>Log in to your AnkiWeb account inside the desktop application and create or import your first flashcards.</li>
<li>Start learning!
<ul>
<li>Optionally, download the Anki mobile app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki" rel="nofollow">Android</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ankimobile-flashcards/id373493387" rel="nofollow">iOS</a>) and learn on the go. Don’t forget to log in to your AnkiWeb account inside the app and sync your repository.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="ftoc-heading-7">How to use Anki</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, installing Anki doesn’t make you ready to start your study sessions. It’s somewhat comparable to buying a blank notebook from which you could’ve studied, but it’s missing your notes. Luckily for us, the community is quite generous, and there’re lots of great flashcards already available. You’ll find some great examples in <a href="https://pawelcislo.com/2020/07/10/optimising-our-learning-retention-rate-with-srs-anki/#ftoc-heading-11">the further part of this post</a>.</p>
<p>Just like before, it’s best to present some things visually. Here is one of the most practical YouTube tutorials showing the most common Anki functions (card reveal, clozes, image occlusion). If you don’t feel like watching the entire clip, you can use the predefined timestamps to go to the right part (to see them, open the video on the YouTube website).</p>
<iframe id="_ytid_13218" width="450" height="253" data-origwidth="450" data-origheight="253" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bJFw9gBkvcY?enablejsapi=1&amp;start=237&amp;autoplay=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;loop=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;autohide=2&amp;theme=dark&amp;color=red&amp;controls=1&amp;" title="YouTube player" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" data-no-lazy="1" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll=""></iframe>

<p>As previously mentioned, we can get some premade cards, but it’s like learning from someone’s else notes. Making cards isn’t as bad once we make at least one of them. I bet you’ll also enjoy card formatting with the CSS code, so the card looks more eye-pleasing (but don’t spend too much time on that!).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there are ways to facilitate the card-creation process. For example, if you tend to annotate some text online (such as I do with <a href="https://hypothes.is/users/pyxelr">Hypothesis</a>), you can use your annotation on the front side of the card and the highlighted part as the answer (back side). Apart from Hypothesis, you may also try using a different annotation tool – Polar that officially supports such conversion <a href="https://getpolarized.io/docs/anki-sync-for-spaced-repetition.html">straight from its software</a>. You can even get automatically generated cards from the displayed word definitions or highlights you create on your Kindle device (the required tools are mentioned in <a href="https://pawelcislo.com/2020/07/10/optimising-our-learning-retention-rate-with-srs-anki/#ftoc-heading-12">the further part of this post</a>).</p>

Within a single platform, payment providers can scale their network across different markets seamlessly. There's no SIM card juggling, multiple carrier agreements to manage, and no need to integrate with various cellular management platforms. Hologram is always expanding our network, and with over-the-air profile updates, we can ensure devices have the best coverage at the best price in each market.<br></p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>When we moved to Ketchum two winters ago, Elizabeth got a job waitressing at a little eight-table local restaurant.</p>
<p>The walls were still blank on her first day of work. They’d only been serving guests for a week.</p>
<p>January 2019 marked the restaurant’s first full month of pumping out pizzas and wine. They went on to do ~3x more<span></span> <span>“</span>monthly” revenue than we did that same month at <a href="https://sendbottles.com/">Bottle</a>. And we had a three year head start!</p>
<p>If each business was reduced to an Excel sheet comparing only revenue, their<span></span> <span>“</span>$100k of sales in the first month” narrative would outshine our<span></span> <span>“</span>5-digit <span>MRR</span> three years in” narrative.</p>
<p>But pizza comes with significant marginal costs: flour, San Marzano’s, mozzarella, cooks, hosts and waiters. There’s a reason I’m happy owning Bottle’s current and future cash flow instead.</p>
<p>Everyone jokes about using revenue as a metric.<span></span> <span>“</span>What we lose per unit we’ll make up in volume!”</p>
<p>But I’ll bite. For software businesses, revenue is a meaningful metric because costs are fairly fixed and familiar: engineers, ads, and <span>AWS</span> bills. This is why the entire SaaS market has been trading ~10x revenue, independent of vertical.</p>
<p><span>“</span>Fixed and familiar costs” don’t apply to the newest venture-backed businesses, though. As revenue becomes the ultimate metric, software-enabled companies are hacking top line revenue. It’s Goodhart’s Law.</p>
<p>I saw a tweet by Garry Tan yesterday, sharing Truepill’s latest $25 million round:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>“</span>Truepill revenue reached $48 million in 2018 and nearly $100 million in 2019; it could reach an estimated $200 million this year as it pushes further into working with health plans, drugmakers and pharmacy benefit managers.”<a href="#footnote-1PW1" id="ref-1PW1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe those revenue numbers are compelling. Maybe the aren’t. I can’t tell because revenue has lost its meaning. It got me thinking about three things:</p>
<h2 id="restaurant-revenue">1. Restaurant Revenue</h2>
<p>I propose a new term: Restaurant Revenue. Restaurant Revenue is revenue that comes with real and significant costs. A pizza. A pizza delivery. A short-term tenant inside a long-term lease. A flu shot. A prescription. These things are inherently different than <span>HTTP</span> packets.</p>
<p>Pharmacies in particular come with incredibly high marginal costs.</p>
<p>I used to think Walgreens used Doritos and Coke to lure people in to buy high-margin drugs. It’s actually the other way around. The pharmacy is a loss-leader to get people to come buy toilet paper and razors. Pharmacies are so low-margin that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wal-mart-stores-results-pharmacy/wal-marts-drug-problem-pharmacy-business-drags-on-profit-idUSKCN0QO01V20150819">the undisputed king of low-margin is struggling to make drugs profitable</a>. Their rival <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wal-mart-stores-results-pharmacy/wal-marts-drug-problem-pharmacy-business-drags-on-profit-idUSKCN0QO01V20150819">Target gave up completely</a>.</p>
<p>Truepill is an API-enabled pharmacy. It’s a great idea. But how much of the $200 million in projected revenue is zero-margin prescription drug revenue?<a href="#footnote-2PW1" id="ref-2PW1"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>If it’s mostly Restaurant Revenue, then it’s a vanity metric.</p>
<h2 id="alpha-revenue">2. Alpha Revenue</h2>
<p>Restaurant Revenue isn’t all bad. Lots of software-enabled companies genuinely reduce costs and induce demand in novel ways.</p>
<p>Thus I propose a second term: Alpha Revenue. Alpha Revenue is the contribution margin that, with a straight face, you can say is added because of software.</p>
<p>Cloud kitchens and Chick-fil-a both sell fried chicken sandwiches. Let’s say a cloud kitchen has trained a robot to hand-batter all the chicken breasts. In doing so, they might knock $0.50 in cost off each chicken sandwich. Alpha Revenue.</p>
<p>Or take Bungalow. They can induce demand from a well-designed website. They can make it easy to split the house and rent by the room. This enables them to turn 3-bedroom houses renting for $3k/mo into 4-bedroom houses renting for $1.2k/room. The Restaurant Revenue is $4.8k/mo, but the Alpha Revenue is $1.8k/mo.</p>
<h2 id="business-models">3. Business Models</h2>
<p>Eventually, the market will sort the valuations out. But, for any business that lists software engineers in its <span>S1</span>, the market is struggling to discriminate between Restaurant Revenue and Alpha Revenue.</p>
<p>It’s how you end up with an <a href="https://www.google.com/search?tbm=fin&amp;q=NYSE%3A%20LMND#scso=_jawHX8TII6CP9PwP_p6D8AI1:0">app-driven insurance provider worth $4 billion</a>.</p>
<p>The downstream valuations are having a negative impact on new startups. There’s a pressure to build revenue as fast as possible, Restaurant Revenue or Alpha Revenue be damned.</p>
<p>My friend is starting a women’s hormonal health company. She wants to pair women with <span>PCOS</span> with providers. <span>VC</span><span></span><span>’</span>s are pushing her to<span></span> <span>“</span>own the entire stack” and bring healthcare providers onto payroll. It’s an easy way to book a lot of top line Restaurant Revenue. She’s wary.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/ahead-a-platform-that-connects-psychiatrists-with-patients-raises-9-million/">Truepill just invested in Ahead</a>, a company with full-time therapists on staff ready to provide Telehealth treatment for <span>ADHD</span>, depression, and anxiety. Lots of Restaurant Revenue. Can they produce Alpha Revenue, though?</p>
<p>If Airbnb was raising a Series A today, it’s tough to imagine <span>VC</span><span></span><span>’</span>s not pushing them to<span></span> <span>“</span>buy the real estate yourselves.” Get the top line revenue to swell, raise the next round, pass off to the public market.</p>
<p>There are better business models than restaurants. Google, Lyft, and Airbnb all invented not only new products, but new business models. Where did all the business model innovation go? I don’t know if it’s a failure of vision or the fact that <span>VC</span><span></span><span>’</span>s got sick of battling independent contractor employment law.</p>
<p>I’ll be curious to see which of these restaurant models end up with enduring Alpha Revenue.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div>
<div>
<article>
<p><span>At the beginning of 2019 StorageOS embarked on a significant development effort to build v2.0 of our product. The cloud native landscape had significantly changed since the inception and subsequent release of StorageOS v1.0, with Kubernetes emerging from the container orchestrator battle royale as the clear winner. We observed two key trends amongst our customers and the industry in general.</span></p>
<p><span>Firstly, customers wanted to run bigger clusters – in the 10’s or even 100’s of nodes. Secondly, customers wanted to run multiple clusters and for the clusters to interact in various patterns. We designed StorageOS 2.0 to address these trends.</span></p>
<p><span>Given the significant development effort to create StorageOS v2.0, we wanted to ensure the testing toolkit and workflow we used was up to the task of verifying our reliability and scalability. At StorageOS, product testing is undertaken by the Product Reliability Engineering (PRE) team, and we tasked ourselves with engineering a new testing framework and suite of tests to do justice to the product the company was building.</span></p>
<p><span>Our previous testing framework (known internally as ‘vol-test’) was based around a set of libraries and scripting tools that included the ability to provision a variety of environments on a variety of platforms for the tests to run in. Vol-test also included functional, end to end, stress and benchmarking tests for the StorageOS API as well as StorageOS running in Kubernetes.</span></p>
<p><span>While feature rich, we often found ourselves wanting a more expressive language and toolset. Additionally, the provisioning and testing functions were closely coupled – which made the system inconvenient to work with at times. We staged our own version of the perennial engineering ‘re-write or improve’ debate and settled on separating the testing and provisioning functions and focusing on a better way to write and execute tests. What we ended up with was three systems:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>T2Infra – </span><i><span>a provisioning framework for creating reproducible environments quickly</span></i></li>
<li><span>T2 – </span><i><span>a testing framework and suite of tests to verify StorageOS behaviour and API outside of Kubernetes</span></i></li>
<li><span>Kubecover – </span><i><span>a testing framework and suite of tests to run within Kubernetes</span></i></li>
</ul>
<p><span>A major consideration was what language to create the new testing frameworks in. The two languages that we considered were Python and Golang; the former due to ease of use and our team’s familiarity with it and the latter because Kubernetes and surrounding projects are often written in Golang. Perhaps more importantly, much of StorageOS is written in Golang too.</span></p>
<p><span>The use of a common language between our Reliability Engineers and our Software Engineering colleagues is a great advantage when testing, as it allows for closer collaboration and tightened development cycles. The static typing and easily accomplished concurrency that Golang offered has been extremely welcomed and has helped to drive development of significantly more complex tests at a significantly reduced cost.</span></p>
<p><b>T2Infra – Fast environment provisioning using Ignite/Firecracker</b></p>
<p><span>T2Infra is a provisioning framework that lets us stand up testing environments quickly. We generally run our tests on </span><a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/"><span>Firecracker</span></a> <span>VMs (for more information about Firecracker check out this </span><a href="https://unixism.net/2019/10/how-aws-firecracker-works-a-deep-dive/"><span>blog </span></a><span>by Shuveb Hussain) by leveraging the </span><a href="https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite"><span>Ignite</span></a> <span>project from our good friends at </span><a href="https://www.weave.works/"><span>Weave</span></a><span>. In essence, Ignite provisions Firecracker virtual machines that run StorageOS containers. That seems like a lot of layers of abstraction but this combination of tooling gives us; highly reproducible, quick to provision, isolated environments for running tests.</span></p>
<p><span>These qualities are important to us as a reproducible environment translates directly into more deterministic tests, while fast provisioning times allow us to spin up a fresh environment for every test. Using a new environment per test means that tests do not “cross-contaminate” one another further increasing the reliability of our tests.</span></p>
<p><b>T2 – Testing outside of Kubernetes</b></p>
<p><span>T2 is a testing framework that was created to test and verify the behaviours of StorageOS while driving StorageOS via its API. The framework consists of libraries to access the StorageOS API, to cause various kinds of ‘chaos’, provide test orchestration functions, and of course, the tests themselves.</span></p>
<p><span>Because we are using lightweight VMs, we have familiar tools available to us for introducing controlled disruption into the test environment. For example we leverage </span><a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/iptables"><span>IPTables</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/ipset"><span>IPSet</span></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/tc"><span>TC</span></a> <span>to cause network partitions, inject latency and restrict bandwidth between nodes. These tools are controlled via the T2 framework during test runtime so changes are entirely dynamic.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For additional insight into the test environment, it is important to collect both logs and traces from inside our VMs. Running additional containers inside the VMs such as the </span><a href="https://www.jaegertracing.io/"><span>Jaeger</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.fluentd.org/"><span>Fluentd</span></a> <span>agents for collecting traces and logs is simple to do with systemd manifests. As each test spins up its own environment it is easy to collect and separate traces and logs from different tests. For more insight into how important tracing is for understanding a distributed system </span><a href="https://dgraph.io/blog/post/solving-jepsen-with-opencensus"><span>Manish Rai Jain from Dgraph</span></a><span> wrote an interesting blog about how he used tracing and Jaeger to squash a bug exposed by </span><a href="https://jepsen.io/"><span>Jepsen</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><b>Kubecover – Adding Kubernetes to the mix</b></p>
<p><span>While T2 is useful for testing StorageOS in a dedicated, predictable environment, the final arbiter of StorageOS as a product is of course how we behave within Kubernetes – since this is how our customers run our product.</span></p>
<p><span>Kubecover is a testing framework written in Golang that uses the </span><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go"><span>Kubernetes </span></a><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go"><span>Golang</span></a> <span>client directly as well as the </span><a href="https://github.com/storageos/go-api/tree/master/v2"><span>StorageOS API</span> <span>Client</span></a> <span>to drive tests of StorageOS within Kubernetes clusters. Our Kubecover framework leverages great work by </span><a href="https://github.com/darkowlzz/"><span>darkowlzz</span></a> <span>to make </span><a href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/"><span>Kubernetes in Docker</span></a><span> (Kind) work with Ignite as a backend instead of Docker. The changes allow us to spin up a Kind cluster with each Kind “node” running on a separate Ignite provisioned Firecracker VM. The advantage of using Kind is that we can spin up local and test environments in a matter of seconds.</span></p>
<p><span>Given the many popular Kubernetes distributions that exist we can also use Kubecover binaries in testing pipelines that run against other Kubernetes distributions. For example we routinely run tests against managed Kubernetes services such as AKS and EKS, as well as various versions of upstream Kubernetes running on cloud infrastructure.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Why have two separate testing frameworks?</b></p>
<p><span>The reason for having two separate test frameworks is separation of concerns. T2 is for end to end testing of the StorageOS container, driven via the StorageOS API, while Kubecover is for testing StorageOS integration with, and behaviours in Kubernetes, driven via the </span><a href="https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/01/15/container-storage-interface-ga/"><span>CSI</span></a><span> interface. Kubernetes adds layers of abstraction that are not always helpful in the end to end testing of StorageOS, so testing StorageOS behaviour is something we generally handle in T2. Testing of Kubernetes specific behaviours then takes place in Kubecover. In general our approach is to first verify the StorageOS API behaviour before adding testing of behaviours running StorageOS in Kubernetes.</span></p>
<p><span>For a more specific example of how we make these distinctions, consider testing of volume resize. We first tested volume resize in T2 to verify that the StorageOS API is behaving correctly and the feature works as we expect it to. Once the correct behaviour was verified, we wrote tests in Kubecover to ensure that CSI resize requests were also being handled correctly. The resize requests in Kubernetes are generated by editing the size of a Persistent Volume Claim so requests come via the CSI API.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>How do we spec our tests?</b></p>
<p><span>In order to have a consistent and clear description each test gets its own </span><a href="https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/"><span>Gherkin</span></a> <span>spec, so the test is described in a </span><span>`GIVEN, WHEN, THEN`</span><span> syntax. The test spec should give the reader a clear indication of what the test is going to do and provides context for the test code itself. Having a consistent approach to documenting our tests has made it easy for anyone in our team to triage a test failure and understand what the test is doing. This approach is particularly helpful when it comes to more complex test cases.</span></p>
<p><span>Typically we begin spec’ing out tests by following the “happy path”. For example the “happy path” spec for resizing a volume looks like the below:</span></p>
<pre><span>GIVEN an unattached volume of size x</span>

<span>WHEN the volume is resized to size y where y is greater than x</span>

<span>THEN the volume will display its new size</span>

<span>AND the block device size will reflect this size</span>

<span>AND the filesystem will reflect a new larger size</span></pre>
<p><span>The happy path test is important as it proves that the feature works as expected. The next priority is an “unhappy path” test that proves the API is not just accepting and actioning any and all requests, whether valid or not.</span></p>
<pre><span>GIVEN an unattached volume of size x</span>

<span>WHEN the volume is resized to size y where y is less than or equal to x</span>

<span>THEN the resize will fail with an easy to understand error</span></pre>
<p><span>Once a happy and unhappy path has been set we investigate cases where failure is assumed. For example in cases of concurrent requests, it is important that we only action the first, and error the rest, as detailed in the following spec:</span></p>
<pre><span>GIVEN an unattached volume of size x</span>

<span>WHEN two concurrent resize requests are made to size y and size z</span>

<span>THEN only one resize will be actioned</span>

<span>AND the other request will receive an error response</span>

</pre>
<p><span>As the StorageOS control plane guarantees linearisable volume updates, one of the concurrent resize requests will fail because each resize request will be using the same volume object version. The first request to reach the API will cause a version bump so the subsequent request will be failed. However there are also linearisable operations that we verify work as intended, such as having </span><a href="https://docs.storageos.com/docs/concepts/replication/#delta-sync"><span>replicas rejoin</span></a> <span>while a resize is occurring. Once the replicas have rejoined they should also reflect the new size of the volume.</span></p>
<p><b>How we run our tests</b></p>
<p><span>We run all of the tests in T2 against development containers throughout the day. …</span></p></article></div></div></div></div>

July 10, 2020 | https://www.dampfkraft.com/nlp/cutlet-python-romaji-converter.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.dampfkraft.com/nlp/cutlet-python-romaji-converter.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few months ago I released <a href="https://github.com/polm/cutlet">cutlet</a>, a Python library and application for
converting arbitrary Japanese text to romaji.</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/c431038e/cutlet.png"><img src="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/c431038e/img/cutlet.png.l.png"></a><figcaption>Katsu curry illustrated by <a href="https://www.irasutoya.com/2014/12/blog-post_479.html">Irasutoya</a>
</figcaption></figure>
<p>Compared to other libraries cutlet has several advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>it uses <a href="https://github.com/polm/fugashi">fugashi</a>, so you can re-use your existing dictionary</li>
<li>words of foreign origin optionally use their original spelling ("cutlet" instead of "katsu") thanks to <a href="https://unidic.ninjal.ac.jp/">Unidic</a></li>
<li>it's easy to add exceptions for specific words</li>
<li>a built-in slug mode for URL generation</li>
</ul>
<p>The foreign spelling feature in particular is something I've never seen in
another system, and in some cases is important for getting things right. For
example, "Sweden Hills" is a neighborhood in Hokkaido, but even the Post Office
data gives the romaji as the odd-looking "Suedenhiruzu". With cutlet the output
would be "Sweden hill" and it's easy to add an exception if you want "Hills".</p>
<p>Here's an example of usage from Python:</p>
<pre><code>from cutlet import Cutlet
katsu = Cutlet()
katsu.romaji("カツカレー")
# =&gt; 'Cutlet curry'
katsu.slug("カツカレー")
# =&gt; 'cutlet-curry'
</code></pre>
<p>One of my main motivations for making this library was dealing with the
frequent case where using Japanese text isn't an option for technical reasons,
or it is an option but comes with downsides. A common example is urls - while
you can use Japanese text in URLs, in many situations the text becomes
unreadable hex escapes, so it's not actually helpful for anyone. Generating an
article slug in romaji creates something that can still be interpreted in
Japanese and is free from any technical compatability worries.</p>
<p>cutlet is available for install via pip, and works on the command line as well
as via Python. If you make use of it I'd love to hear about it. If there's a
feature you'd like it to include feel free to <a href="https://github.com/polm/cutlet/issues">open an issue</a>. While I
don't have any more major features planned, I would like to make a web version
you can use to try it out; I'll post about that on Twitter if I ever get it set
up. Ψ</p>

                        <li>You don't need a high-end laptop, since most of your work will only take place in a browser. Snagging a cheap or used device is a good option. (Chromebooks that allow USB booting are a solid option as well)</li>

                <li>Boot into Tails OS via the USB flash drive on your burner laptop</li>

            <h2>Important &amp; Helpful Notes</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Never use a custom domain name - these require some of your personal information when being registered. Even with whois privacy protection, certain law enforcement can demand for these credentials.</li>
                <li>Feel free to use a VPN, though Tor is more than enough for your needs.</li>
                <li>Whenever you boot Tails OS, it will load with a fresh install. To keep files on the USB even when shutdown, look into using <a href="https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/persistence/index.en.html">Encrypted Persistent Storage </a>. Please note: <i>this is not recommended</i> for obvious security risks.</li>
                <li>Run your articles through multiple translation converters. Edit minor mistakes afterwards. This avoids engines and tools picking up on your writing style.</li>
                <li>Always backup your articles. The safest bet is to use <a href="https://archive.org/">archive.org</a></li>
                <li>Don't expect to collect revenue with your blog. It is extremely difficult to accept payment without some form of tracking to your personal information. If anything, maybe allow your users to donate to a charity you would like to support.</li>
                <li>WordPress is the suggested blog platform but there are others to choose from:
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://write.as/">Write.as</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Try your best to avoid publishing articles on your home or work network. Make a trip to the local coffee shop during busy hours and post it then.</li>
                <li>Randomly select different times to publish articles. Avoid creating a trackable pattern.</li>
                <li>Never work on anything related to your blog unless using the burner laptop and Tails OS. This might seem simple, but one little slip-up is all it takes.</li>
            </ol>

July 10, 2020 | http://steen.free.fr/interslavic/slovianto1.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://steen.free.fr/interslavic/slovianto1.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><b>Slovianto</b> is a highly simplified form of Interslavic that allows non-Slavic people to express themselves at a very basic level when visiting Slavic countries or maintaining contact with Slavs via the Internet. Grammar is limited to a bare minimum, and forms that are not strictly necessary are not used at all. Because it does not contain anything that cannot be found in the Slavic languages, the result wil not look or sound too awkward to Slavic speakers, but rather remind them of the kind of language used by small children.</p><p>Slovianto can also be used as a first step in the process of learning the „real” Interslavic language. It has been constructed in such way that it can gradually be expanded with new bits and pieces that occur in more complex versions. Thus, we distinguish three different levels, each of them adding new elements that bring Slovianto closer to Interslavic:
</p><p>The working title <b>Slovianto</b> is a portmanteau word for „Slavic Esperanto”. This name, albeit somewhat tongue-in-cheek, refers to the simplicity of Slovianto: it has no gender, no cases, no aspect, little conjugation and no irregularity. Yet, that is where the similarity to Esperanto ends, because Slovianto's means of simplification are in fact far more similar to those used by Interlingua.</p><p>Slovianto can be written in the Latin alphabet and the Cyrillic alphabet, but we will concentrate on the Latin alphabet here:

</p><p>In the <a href="http://steen.free.fr/interslavic/en-ms.html">Interslavic dictionary</a> you will find other characters as well, like <b>ò</b>, <b>ų</b>, <b>å</b> or <b>ť</b>. You can simply ignore the diacritics and read them as <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, <b>a</b>, <b>t</b> etc. That goes for <b>ě</b>, too. The only characters that keep their diacritics in Latin orthography are <b>č</b>, <b>š</b> and <b>ž</b>. If you find writing them inconvenient, you can always use <b>cz</b>, <b>sz</b> and <b>zs</b> (or <b>cx</b>, <b>sx</b> and <b>zx</b>) as an alternative.</p><p>Accentuation is fairly free. What matters more is that you speak slowly and clearly. As a general guideline, it would deserve recommendation to put stress on the antepenultimate syllable.</p><div width="90%"><tbody><tr><td>

							<p>PARIS — The French Parliament unanimously agreed on Thursday to introduce a nationwide age verification system for pornography websites, months after President Emmanuel Macron pledged to protect children against such content.</p>
<p>Macron made the protection of children against adult content online a high-profile issue well before the coronavirus crisis hit. In January, tech companies, internet services providers and the adult movies industry <a href="https://www.lefigaro.fr/secteur/high-tech/les-fournisseurs-d-acces-des-acteurs-du-web-et-marc-dorcel-s-engagent-pour-proteger-les-mineurs-du-porno-20200117" target="_blank">signed a voluntary charter</a>, pledging to roll out tools to help ensure minors don’t have access to pornographic content.</p>
<p>Within a broader law on domestic violence, the Senate decided <a href="https://www.publicsenat.fr/article/parlementaire/porno-le-senat-bloque-l-accessibilite-des-sites-aux-mineurs-183097" target="_blank">in June</a> to introduce an amendment requiring pornography websites to implement an age verification mechanism.</p>
<p>In order to enforce the law, the French audiovisual regulator CSA will be granted new powers to audit and sanction companies that do not comply — sanctions could go as far as blocking access to the websites in France with a court order.</p>
<p>The choice of verification mechanisms will be left up to the platforms. But lawmakers have suggested using credit card verification — a system first adopted by the U.K., which mulled similar plans to control access to pornography but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/oct/16/uk-drops-plans-for-online-pornography-age-verification-system" target="_blank">had to drop them</a> in late 2019 because of technical difficulties and privacy concerns. Italy also approved a <a href="https://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/eli/gu/2020/06/29/162/sg/pdf" target="_blank">similar bill in late June</a>, which raised the same concerns over its feasibility and <a href="https://www.key4biz.it/filtro-anti-porno-nicita-agcom-limiti-tecnici-norma-pillon-a-rischio-disapplicazione/312167/" target="_blank">compliance with the EU laws</a>.</p>
<p>As private actors could implement their own solutions, the new law also highlights the challenges of digital identification. In Brussels, there are growing calls to introduce an EU-wide digital ID system that would allow users to bypass Google and Facebook’s identification ecosystem. For politicians, including French Junior Digital Minister Cédric O, systems of identification online are <a href="https://www.zdnet.fr/actualites/identite-numerique-le-cnnum-veut-soutenir-l-effort-deja-engage-par-le-gouvernement-39905257.htm" target="_blank">a matter of digital sovereignty</a>.</p>
<p>The Senate has already voted on the bill. Following an agreement today between senators and lawmakers from the lower house National Assembly, a final vote will be held again in the Senate where the bill is expected to pass.</p>
<p>Senators have also suggested using FranceConnect, a tool developed by the state to help users connect to public services such as tax collection and health insurance.</p>
<p>In the face of skepticism and privacy concerns from campaigners, O has since <a href="https://www.zdnet.fr/actualites/identite-numerique-le-cnnum-veut-soutenir-l-effort-deja-engage-par-le-gouvernement-39905257.htm" target="_blank">denied</a> that the national connection tool would be used.</p>
<p>"We voted on one principle, which is to give the CSA the obligation to monitor the protection of minors, but the CSA is free to find the right way for sites to comply with their injunction," the text’s rapporteur in the Senate Marie Mercier told POLITICO.</p>
<h3><strong>Minitel rose</strong></h3>
<p>Key actors from the French porn industry have long called for new measures to modernize a French law which was drafted at the time of the “Minitel rose,” a very popular pornography service in the 1980s.</p>
<p>“[With this law] we can already fine up to 75,000 euros and three years of prison, but no one applies it,” said Mercier.</p>
<p>The conservative politician worked on the amendment after hearings with French pornography producer Marc Dorcel, ex-adult actress-turned-documentary-director Ovidie and child protection NGOs.</p>
<p>“Most of those who abide by the law feel that it’s unfair that the [sites] keep doing their business without restriction," Mercier added.</p>
<p>For years, one of the most difficult tasks for French regulators has been finding a way to enforce local laws on foreign services.</p>
<p>With this new law, if the site does not comply within 15 days after a first warning from the audiovisual regulator CSA, the regulator will be able to ask the Paris Court of Justice to send an order to telecom operators to block the access to these sites from France.</p>

        <p><i>posted on 29 May 2020</i></p><p>Yes, you read it right! Don’t let the feature requests you receive from your customers drive your product roadmap. Instead, let the real problems they are facing do.</p>

<p>Nearly 4 years ago, when I had just transitioned from engineering to product management here is how I used to respond to one of the most important questions that you get asked as a product manager.</p>

<p><a href="https://akshayd.in/2020/05/29/Don-t-let-feature-requests-from-your-customers-drive-your-product-roadmap!/">Read More</a></p>

<!--more-->

<p><span>Question</span> - Why do you think this feature should be on the roadmap? <br>
<span>Answer</span> - Because customers XYZ and ABC have asked for it
</p>
<p>It sounds naive in the hindsight but I’ve cut myself some slack given it was my first time as a product manager.</p>

<p>Sometimes, we as product managers consider the number of customers that have asked for a particular feature as a parameter to add weight to the decision of adding it to the roadmap. However, it is easy to fall prey to this vanity metric by right away acknowledging the feature request as a gap in your offering that needs to be filled without analysing the feature request thoroughly. Analysing your customers’ feature requests in a proper manner will help you identify the right set of problems your customers are facing. Many times, you will realize that the problem does not have to be solved by the exact feature the customers are suggesting.</p>

<p>While there are numerous ways in which one could dissect the feature request , the <a href="https://hbr.org/2012/02/the-5-whys.html"><b>FIVE WHYS framework</b></a> provides a simple and effective way of getting to the core of the problem.  The 5 Whys framework is an iterative interrogation technique to determine the root cause of the problem by repeatedly asking the question -  “Why” . Here is an example of my recent experience of using this framework to address a customer’s feature request.</p>

<div>
<p><span>Customer</span> : We’d like an API endpoint to fetch the loyalty information of users. </p><p>
<span>Me</span>: Could you please let us know why you would want an API endpoint since you already have this information in the members’ report? </p><p>
<span>Customer</span> :   We’d like to build an automated process of getting the information via an API every night and dump that information at an FTP location ?</p><p>
<span>Me</span> : Alright, sounds good. Could you please tell me why you would want to dump this information at an FTP location ?  What happens after you dump it to FTP location.</p><p> 
<span>Customer</span> : We have crons that would read the information and sync the information with the contacts in Hubspot CRM . </p><p>
<span>Me</span> : Okay. Why do you sync the loyalty information in Hubspot ? </p><p>
<span>Customer</span> :  We want to use the loyalty information to be included in the marketing emails that we send.</p><p>
<span>Me</span> : We already have Hubspot integration underway exactly for this use case. Every time the loyalty information of the user changes, the change will be synced with the Hubspot user profile automatically with the integration. You could then set triggers in Hubspot to send out emails with the loyalty information. 
</p></div>

<p>In the above example, although it seemed like a feature request for a new API endpoint, the ultimate job that the customer was looking to get done with this API was to include the loyalty information in the marketing emails sent via Hubspot. The actual problem was unearthed by repeatedly asking the question “Why”. Evidently, the plethora of information this framework gives you as you go deeper layer by layer not only helps you reach to the core of the problem but also gives you holistic insights about it. You may choose any other framework that helps with problem analysis. The bottomline is to ensure that you thoroughly understand the rationale behind the feature request.</p>

<p>Customers will often ask you the world. More often than not, the feature requests your customers raise if considered verbatim, have the potential to derail your product strategy. Tending to such feature requests without peeling the layers of the onion may help you pacify a couple of customers but will harm your product in the long run. For a winning product strategy , it is very imperative to choose solving those problems that align with your product and company goals.</p>

<p>After all , effective product management is not just about solving problems but about choosing  the right set of problems to solve.</p>

<p>This has been an interesting year! When the pandemic came and left us all housebound, I used it as an excuse to do some remedial work I’d been dreading—moving Pinboard onto modern versions of PHP and MySQL. Things had gotten to the point where I couldn’t even run a bug-for-bug identical copy of the site on a modern laptop, and the servers themselves were overdue for system upgrades. 

</p><p>Much of the core code on the site dated back to 2009-2010 and was written by Past Me, a vindictive, inscrutable nemesis who devoted his life to sabotaging Present Me. 

</p><p><img src="https://idlewords.com/images/past_me.jpg">

</p><p><i>Past Me laying his snares in 2009.</i></p>

<p>Doing this on a live system is like performing kidney transplants on a playing mariachi band. The best case is that no one notices a change in the music; you chloroform the players one at a time and try to keep a steady hand while the band plays on.  The worst case scenario is that the music stops and there is no way to unfix what you broke, just an angry mob. It is very scary.

</p><p>But I got it done! It helped in this process that I was in Japan, since I could do most work at night while my US/European customers slept or wept into their phones or whatever it is people do at night nowadays. 

</p><p>The site is now on a 2020 foundation (specifically, it’s on PHP 7 and a current MySQL), and with everything less brittle I can start making bigger changes. One of those is to make the site look okay on mobile phones, now that I’m finally convinced they aren’t a fad. You can see the beginnings of this reworking on the <a href="https://pinboard.in/about/">about page</a> and in other corners of the site.

</p><p>Another is to finish the new API. The current one was designed to be a drop-in replacement for the old Delicious API and lacks important features, like any way to say “show me stuff that has changed since timestamp X”, or interact with Pinboard features that weren’t present in Delicious.

</p><p>Another analogy I’d use for this kind of upgrade work is clearing a disused garden. In the process you may unearth remarkable stuff—an old wagon wheel, a Roman urn—hiding among the weeds. But it’s mostly interesting to you, and not to the people who are waiting in line at your vegetable stand.

</p><p>In my case, I found the skeletons of dead features (remember placemarks?) as well as spectral ghosts of defunct services like Google Reader, Readability, and of course Delicious itself, which now slumbers peacefully while I try to figure out a way to bring it up without dealing with the waves of automated spam still pointed at the site. But I’ll save that for another post.

</p><p>Now that I have a fresher memory of how the site works, and am not so afraid of touching anything, I look forward to doing some long-delayed feature development.

<p>Another new blog on the internet – aren’t there already enough of
those? <a href="http://tttthis.com/blog/if-i-could-bring-one-thing-back-to-the-internet-it-would-be-blogs">Some would say
no</a>.
I, for one, am a fan of the open, interoperable, indie web,
even if that seems to stack the cards against you.<sup id="fnref:indie-disadvantage"><a href="#fn:indie-disadvantage">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I’ll keep this introductory post brief. We<sup id="fnref:we"><a href="#fn:we">2</a></sup> want to start a SaaS
product, and while there seem to be awfully many “founder stories”
around of people magically getting 50k downloads, $10k MRR, etc., we
don’t often hear about the long, rocky path to sustainable success.
There’s often scant detail about the initial steps: ideation,
validation, etc. Also, all these whiz-bang success stories suffer
from enormous survivorship bias. Not to mention they leave us normal
folks feeling quite inadequate, when in reality there’s enormous luck
involved, too.<sup id="fnref:luck"><a href="#fn:luck">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Unfortunately, “failure” isn’t sexy. As a result there seem to be few
resources online talking about the things people have tried that
<em>haven’t</em> worked. We want to take a more optimistic view. From each
“failure” we hope to learn things, get better at what we’re trying to
do, so that 10 years from now, looking back, we can point at all the
hustle that goes into trying to Build Something.</p>
<p>We figured we might as well challenge ourselves to get something out
there, right now, instead of waiting until perhaps one day if and/or
when we manage to create something successful. This way, at the very
least we’re keeping ourselves accountable by publicly writing about
what we’re trying, and who knows, we might be able to say something
that someone somewhere finds useful. We’re also very keen for
feedback, so any and all input is more than welcome. Ideas, critique,
links to resources, we want it, our inboxes are open. Have a look at
the <a href="https://exsaasperated.com/contact/">Contact us page</a> if you want to get in touch, or try our
low-budget comments box down below!</p>
<p>We’re just trying to muddle along making our own way here, so we’re
bound to have many a false start, but we are trying something new to
us – <a href="https://exsaasperated.com/mailing-list/">join us for the ride</a>, and we’ll see what happens!</p>

  </div>
</div>


<p>The COVID-19 crisis has put a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/business/economy/coronavirus-inequality.html">spotlight</a> on the dramatic growth of inequality, with the wealthy able to take refuge in holiday homes while many workers living paycheck to paycheck cannot afford to socially isolate. Somewhere in between are middle-class families that have been mostly able to ride out the storm by staying inside but at the same time are becoming increasingly aware of how precarious their security — financial and otherwise — really is.</p>



<p>Over the previous decade, no book has done more than Thomas Piketty’s “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” to bring the question of economic inequality back on the public agenda. At the core of Piketty’s argument is the famous formula “r &gt; g,” which he takes to be the central law of capitalism. Now emblazoned on t-shirts and coffee mugs, the formula expresses the idea that, in the absence of remedial state intervention, the return on capital (r) will grow faster than the economy (g).</p>



<p>Piketty tells the story of the runaway (and accelerating) growth of wealth at the very top, which is not in doubt. As governments eased post-World War II financial regulations over the past few decades, unrestrained capitalism created returns on assets that grew at far higher rates than GDP.</p>



<p>Where Piketty’s story is less convincing is in explaining how this trend continues in spite of growing discontent and widespread awareness of its harmful consequences. Piketty claims that the concentration of private wealth has led to the growth of a plutocracy: the concentration of political influence in the hands of the super-wealthy. But this isn’t an explanation; it just raises other questions, like why do electorates keep voting governments into office that facilitate this concentration of wealth? It is strange to see an otherwise politically middle-of-the-road scholar like Piketty embrace what is essentially a crude Marxist understanding of the capitalist state as a plaything in the hands of the wealthy.</p>



<p>The sustained acceleration of wealth at the top in a democratic society is only comprehensible if we recognize that this trend has been embedded in a wider middle-class politics that has come to center on housing and, in particular, property inflation.</p>

      “As other flagship projects of the neoliberal era floundered, the politics of middle-class aspiration came to increasingly revolve around homeownership.”    </p>

    
    
  </div>
</div>




<p>During the mid-20th century, Anglo-American countries, in particular, managed to promote widespread homeownership through a variety of policies. This <span data-note="John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) was a British economist famous for his theories of government influence on business and the economy; he argued that fiscal regulation is necessary to maintain stable economic growth.">Keynesian</span> model of capitalism brought property ownership into reach for those without access to inherited wealth. Being a wage-earner (someone who, in Marx’s famous phrase, has nothing but his labor-power to sell) was no longer a condition that condemned people to a marginal existence based on getting by from day to day. It was now a social status that could give people a concrete stake in the capitalist social order. Although this state of affairs was characterized by pernicious gender and racial hierarchies, the creation of a broad-based middle class should nonetheless be seen as a unique historic achievement.</p>



<p>The Keynesian model worked on the basis of steady annual wage growth. As the post-war era progressed, this became associated with consumer price inflation that eroded the value of assets. Neoliberalism always had its own, distinctive middle-class politics that centered on the idea of an ownership society. The supply-side doctrine of trickle-down economics was only the crudest expression of an ideology of democratized capital that was integral to the entire project of neoliberal capitalism. Inclusion in the benefits of capitalism was to come not from state protections and the power of unions but from full commitment to the spirit of entrepreneurialism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was among the first to understand the emotional appeal of that prospect when, in the midst of her attacks on unions and the public sector, she offered working-class residents the opportunity to buy the homes they had until then rented from the public sector. This, it was hoped, would serve as a buy-in to the psychology of investment and encourage ordinary people to see themselves as asset-holders rather than workers.</p>

      “In many large cities, it is virtually impossible to break into the property market just on the basis of an average wage.”    </p>

    
    
  </div>
</div>




<p>The ideology of democratized capital found expression in three key areas: pensions, human capital and housing. The risks associated with pension privatization were never lost on people, but the upward march of stock markets for much of the 1990s refocused attention on the seemingly boundless opportunities offered there. But as stock markets fizzled in the early 2000s, dreams of pension-fund capitalism largely faded along with them. Dreams of human capital too reached their zenith in the 1990s, when <span data-note="“Third way” ideas emphasize moderate social, political and economic policies to reconcile left-wing and right-wing political partisanship. Key “third way” politicians include Bill Clinton and Tony Blair.">“third way”</span> thinking in the context of the <span data-note="The idea of a “new economy” arose during the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s to refer to the transition from a manufacturing-based economy to one driven by services and information technology.">“new economy”</span> held out the prospect that highly skilled knowledge workers could monetize their educational assets.</p>



<p>It is really only in the area of housing that the promise of democratized asset ownership found lasting traction. Success in this area derived in large part from the fact that it could build directly on the legacy of democratized homeownership left by the Keynesian era. Liberalizing credit markets appeared to be the most readily available way to push homeownership rates up further. The upward pressure on house prices that this entailed initially led primarily to a democratization of the <span data-note="The “wealth effect” is the change in spending that occurs when people perceive that their wealth has increased.">“wealth effect,”</span> which also became an important source of economic growth.</p>



<p>Over time, it became tempting for governments to respond to each economic slowdown by boosting the housing market, in the process creating an economy that was more and more dependent on stimulus from the wealth effect of asset inflation. As other flagship projects of the neoliberal era floundered, the politics of middle-class aspiration came to increasingly revolve around homeownership.</p>

<p>The home became an asset rather than simply property — an investment that was expected not merely to generate returns but also capital gains. As people with stagnant wages and unstable employment bought houses with large amounts of debt, it became more and more important for those houses to appreciate in value. At least initially, this wealth effect helped to compensate for stagnant wages. The Keynesian household became a <span data-note="Hyman Minsky was an American economist who lived from 1919 to 1996. He is often referred to as a “post-Keynesian” economist, and his work stresses the role of uncertainty, speculation and debt in the economic system.">Minskyan</span> household, increasingly dependent on the speculative returns on its investment. Capitalism itself transitioned to a Minskyan phase, where the continued appreciation of an asset was a precondition for being able to finance it.</p>



<p>But of course, the very logic of credit-driven home purchases pushed prices up to heights where it was increasingly difficult to enter the market. Property inflation benefits the already propertied and excludes aspiring middle-class households from the housing market. In the U.S. as well as in other countries, including the U.K. and Canada, homeownership rates show a particular pattern over the period from 1980 to 2020 — an upward trend followed by a downward trend. Property inflation over time eroded the possibility of buying a home on the basis of a wage alone. In many large cities, it is virtually impossible to break into the property market just on the basis of an average wage.</p>



<p>The crisis of 2007-8 did significant damage to the reputation of housing as a democratic generator of wealth, but things have become significantly worse since then. Defying widespread expectations, housing markets in large urban centers rebounded with a vengeance. This has raised the bar for entry dramatically: The same salary that would have allowed someone to buy into the property market 10 years ago no longer allows that, because in some places, property prices have doubled in the meantime.</p>

    <p>
      “Housing inflation has built a new class structure that revolves around asset ownership instead of employment.”    </p>

    
    
  </div>
</div>




<p>The post-crisis era has also exposed a generational rift. The consequences of property inflation are felt particularly acutely by millennials. Many members of that generation played by all the rules yet, by their mid-20s, still find themselves without any real prospect of a middle-class existence — unless, of course, they have wealthy parents willing to help. Because property gets passed from one generation to the next, it makes little sense to frame the problem in terms of boomers against millennials. The millennial phenomenon is so important because it is in that age cohort that the fault lines produced by four decades of sustained property inflation are becoming highly visible.</p>



<p>This has hardly gone unnoticed, but widespread concerns have yet to translate into significant policy changes. Policymakers and politicians are increasingly concerned about issues of housing affordability, but any policies designed to address the problem are inevitably double-edged: Measures, like lower interest rates, that bring property ownership into reach for some simultaneously push prices up further. In other words, we face a situation of policy lock-in, whereby policymakers can only improve things in the short term by making them worse in the long term.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I see a common pattern with startups and teams I’ve advised or been a part of. I call it the Software Over-specification Death Spiral, or SODS for short.</p>



<p>It looks like this:</p>



<ol><li>Product Manager (or CEO, Engineering Manager, etc) drafts up some sort of specifications or requirements for a new feature or product.</li><li>Product Manager (or CEO, Engineering Manager, etc) drafts up some sort of specifications or requirements for a new feature or product.</li><li>The requirements are handed over to the engineering team to implement.</li><li>The engineering team “implements” it, but gets some things wrong. One bucket of things that are prone to being wrong could be things that were so obvious that the PM thought they weren’t worth making explicit. Another bucket are corner or edge-cases that the PM didn’t think of.</li><li>The PM is surprised at this, and work has to be redone.</li><li>In an effort to prevent this in the future, both the PM and the engineering team agree that requirements need to be more detailed.</li><li>Surprise: despite the increased details in requirements, the engineering team still gets it wrong.</li></ol>



<p>In each iteration of this loop, everyone agrees the requirements just need more details, but every time that happens, things are still wrong. What’s going on?</p>



<h4>Breeding Code&nbsp;Monkeys</h4>



<p>You’re breeding code monkeys, is what’s happening. Software is complex and malleable, and no set of specifications or requirements will ever be complete. There will always be behavior that requires some “filling in the blanks” at implementation time. The person doing the implementation needs to be able to either:</p>



<ul><li>Recognize when they should ask for clarification, or, preferably,</li><li>Be able to fill-in-the-blanks correctly.</li></ul>



<p>Counterintuitively, once you have this problem, the more you try to weed out ambiguity in requirements, the more likely you are cause <em>the opposite</em> effect of what you’ve want. Engineers turn off the part of their brain that they would use to think through product decisions, and become, essentially, “code monkeys” that just do what they’re told.</p>



<h4>A Better&nbsp;Way</h4>



<p>Does that mean you shouldn’t write specifications or requirements, or you should right <em>less? </em>Well, let’s not throw the baby out with the bathwater just yet. Specifications are important, but if you’re missing key pieces, they can make your problem worse.</p>



<p>At a high-level, when you’re building software, there are three questions to answer:</p>



<ol><li>What the software does—requirements and behavior</li><li>Why it does what it does—actual problem it solves for its users</li><li>How it does what it does—the actual implementation</li></ol>



<p>These three are all related. SODS occurs when engineers try to do #1 and #3 without understanding #2. As Simon Sinek would say, “you must start with why”.</p>



<p>It’s on both the PM and the engineering team to understand “the why”. A few suggestions for PMs (and engineers):</p>



<ul><li>Hire or worth with engineers who are inclined to understand the product, because they could be users themselves or because they have some other interest in the product space (or, as an engineer, try to help build <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">products that you would use</a> or that you find interesting).</li><li>Make sure you explain <em>why</em> something is worth building (or, as an engineer, make sure you understand that, and if you don’t, ask).</li><li>Push engineers to be involved in <a href="https://www.quora.com/Should-software-engineers-be-involved-in-product-decisions" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">product decisions</a> (or, as an engineer, try to be involved in various pre-implementation parts of the product lifecycle).</li><li>Undertake other activities that help engineers build product intuition. Engineers can spend time with users, spend time understanding your products analytics, etc.</li><li>If you really want to test whether an engineer is thinking about “the why”, have an engineer write the specifications for a feature of reasonable size, and then have the PM review them. If they can’t even attempt that, that’s usually a bad sign (though the worst sign of all is if they absolutely don’t want to even try).</li></ul>



<p>Don’t fall victim to SODS.</p>

<p><span><span>Reading Time: </span> <span>2</span> <span>minutes</span></span></p><h2>Couples with fertility issues will also see a change in citizenship benefits</h2>



<p>Canadian families are as diverse as Canadians themselves, and everyone deserves the same rights and opportunities, no matter who they love or how they identify.</p>



<p>In recognition of the diversity of <a href="http://citizenship/" target="_blank" aria-label="Canadian  (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Canadian </a>families, the Honourable Marco E.&nbsp;L. Mendicino, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, today announced a change in the interpretation of “parent” under the Citizenship Act. The change allows non-biological Canadian parents who are their child’s legal parent at birth to pass down Canadian citizenship to their children born abroad in the first generation.</p>



<p>“I am very happy to announce this historic and positive declaration made by Quebec’s Superior Court. This change by Immigration Refugees and Citizenship <a href="http://citizenship/" target="_blank" aria-label="Canada  (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Canada </a>means that non-biological legal parents at birth and biological parents are now viewed equally as a child’s parent for the purposes of citizenship by descent. Canadian LGBTQ2+ families and parents experiencing fertility issues have waited too long for this important day. I know this was a difficult and stressful time for the Caron / van der Ven family, and Canada is grateful to them for the courage and strength they have shown in righting this wrong.”</p>



<p><strong>– The Honourable Marco E.&nbsp;L. Mendicino, P.C., M.P., Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship</strong></p>



<figure><img src="https://www.thedailyscrum.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/canadian-citizenship-benefits.jpg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://www.thedailyscrum.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/canadian-citizenship-benefits.jpg"></figure>



<p>This new interpretation helps Canadian parents who have relied on assisted human reproduction to start a family, including members of the LGBTQ2+ community and couples with fertility issues. Until now, a child born abroad was automatically recognized as a citizen at birth only if the child shared a genetic link to the Canadian parent or if the child was born to a Canadian parent in the first generation.</p>



<p>“Getting citizenship for our son was a long, sometimes hurtful and frustrating journey. We are extremely happy and relieved that the court corrected this discriminating policy, not only for our family, but also for many same-sex and non-traditional families around the world who could not get Canadian citizenship for their children. We are very thankful to IRCC for implementing the new changes so quickly, and above all, to our lawyers Olga Redko and Audrey Boctor, without whom we would never have gotten this far. – <strong><em>Laurence Caron and Elsje van der Ven</em></strong></p>



<p>This change is the result of the advocacy of the Caron / van der Ven family, who sought a durable solution through the court system to address situations where some children of parents using assisted human reproduction did not acquire citizenship automatically at birth. The Superior Court of Québec affirmed that Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada’s (IRCC) new interpretation of “parent” recognizes equally biological parents and legal parents at birth, and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms protects this interpretation under the law.</p>

	<div>
		<div>
			<p>I was such an idiot. I gave up literally $125,000 to do dropshipping.</p>
<p>You see, I quit my $250,000 a year job to go do dropshipping.</p>
<p>I spent 6 months dropshipping, fulltime. That was all I did. The opportunity cost of that was massive.</p>
<p>I also lost $2000 USD after spending $12,000 on Facebook ads and Instagram shoutouts.</p>
<p>And if I had to go back in time to March 2019, I’d yell “Stop!!! Don’t do dropshipping! Do this other thing instead!”</p>
<p>And in fact, as early as May I had read a anti-dropshipping thread that explained why dropshipping was a bad first venture. I should’ve listened. I should’ve paid more attention.</p>
<p>But alas, here we are.</p>
<p>Wait, what is “that other thing” I’d have told myself to do?</p>
<p>Well, I guess you’ll just have to read until the end to find out 🙂</p>
<p>Now don’t let this blog post discourage you, because online business is a worthy goal. But there are other online businesses you should consider that may be cheaper.</p>
<p>Hopefully you can learn something from my $2000 mistake. If this post helps save you some money, then I will consider myself a happy man.</p>



<p>You might be thinking: well, I bet he didn’t spend enough time on it. Or I bet he just didn’t want to spend money (or was too afraid to). Or maybe he didn’t read enough about copywriting / marketing.</p>
<p>Well let me talk a little more about my dropshipping experience so you can know if this post is for you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I had a ton of time</strong>. The 6 months I spent dropshipping was basically full-time. I had no job (didn’t need one). I freelanced myself about $2000 for a rate of about $60/hour, plus some credit card signup bonuses ($300 here and there), to fund the dropshipping venture
<ul>
<li>So no, there’s no “laziness” or “not enough effort” excuse. That was a solid 6 months. This venture should’ve “worked” by then. It didn’t.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>I was well read</strong>. I’d read Charlie Munger’s Psychological Checklist. Influence. All the recommended copywriting books, direct response books (e.g. Scientific Advertising, Ogilvy’s stuff). Really. I’d read a lot man. I didn’t slack on this dropshipping venture.</li>
<li><strong>I had a bunch of money</strong>.&nbsp;I had enough savings from my previous job to last me a lifetime (<em>easily</em>). But I’ve never started a business. I really wanted to start a business. And it wasn’t going to be in-person. If I’m gonna start a business, it better be online.
<ul>
<li>What was my previous job? I was a software engineer in Silicon Valley. Living extremely frugally. I had enough money.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And yes, I was dropshipping from Aliexpress. I used Shopify. I watched all the Youtube videos of James Holt, Gabriel St Germain (appears to be the most legit dropshipper there).</p>
<p>OK? So I had everything going for me (theoretically at least). Why did I end up ditching dropshipping?</p>

<p>There’s one main reason: it’s really expensive.</p>
<p>You can learn the same thing for a lot cheaper. And I mean&nbsp;<em>a lot</em> cheaper. And possibly even better too.</p>
<p>Well there are other reasons too:</p>
<ul>
<li>A) It’s really expensive</li>
<li>A2) Split testing is EXPENSIVE in dropshipping</li>
<li>B) The learning curve for dropshipping is extremely steep, due to many skillsets needed to make it work</li>
<li>C) A lot of headaches come with scaling a winner in dropshipping</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="A)_It%E2%80%99s_really_expensive"></span>A) It’s really expensive.<span></span></h2>
<p>How much budget do you need to start a dropshipping business?</p>
<p>Well, the fake gurus out there will tell you only need $300 to start a dropshipping business. “<em>And you too can make $10,000 a month!</em>” Ah, SMH.</p>
<p>It’s true. To&nbsp;<em>start</em>, you only need maybe $100. Shopify subscription, domain name, a couple Shopify plugins, maybe an Instagram shoutout.</p>
<p>But to do it&nbsp;<em>properly</em>, a real marketing venture, you need wayyyy more than $300. And I mean WAY more. I’m talking $10,000 – $15,000 range.</p>
<blockquote><p>What do you mean Muhima? How can it cost that much?</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah well I’m talking about&nbsp;<em>testing</em> ads, testing products.</p>
<p>To run all those tests, you need a lot of money. To buy data.</p>
<p>And how many tests will it take to find a winner?</p>
<p>The best dropshippers I’ve watched on Youtube and the best marketers I followed on Twitter all have a hit rate of about 1 in 10. Or 10%.</p>
<p>To test a product, you need to run 3 tests, running different emotional angles. 1 headline/image for each one.</p>
<p>What does each test cost? The rule of thumb is to run the ad to 3x gross margin in loss. For example, if you make $30 gross margin on your product ($40 price point, dropshipped from China for $10 each), then you need to run the test to $90.</p>
<p>So each product you’re testing out costs $270, at minimum.</p>
<p>But wait, lets say you had one promising angle returning -20% ROI (which is good). Then you gotta run 2 more variations off that. Lets say you change up the image/video creative. Boom, that’s another $270.</p>
<p>Ok, now zoom out. Remember the best marketers have a hit rate of 10%. Oh shit. 10 times $270 is how many? $2700 already. Oh shit.</p>
<p>But wait, you’re a newbie. You’re not experienced like those guys. And besides, what if you have a run of bad luck? So your likely hit rate is no better than 5%. To give yourself a margin of safety, ideally you want to have a budget twice that, just in case. How much are we at now? 20*$270 * 2 = $10,000+</p>
<p>Yeah man. It’s expensive to do dropshipping right.</p>
<p>Believe me, there are other internet businesses that don’t require as much starting budget to do right.</p>
<h2><span id="A2)_Split_testing_is_EXPENSIVE_in_dropshipping"></span>A2) Split testing is EXPENSIVE in dropshipping<span></span></h2>
<p>And I mean EXPENSIVE.</p>
<p>True split testing requires statistically significant data (lets say at least 90% statistical significance. Really it should be 95%, but some people relax the standard to 90% in the interest of trying to hit green sooner)</p>
<p>Do you know how many conversions you need to reach statistical significance?</p>
<p>3 conversions ain’t gonna cut it bro. 10 isn’t going to do it either.</p>
<p>I’m talking at least 50-100, if you’re trying to split-test a 20% improvement. I’ve had split-tests run up to 200 conversions.</p>
<p>So lets call it between 100-200 conversions.</p>
<p>It really takes A LOT of data to hit statistical significance.</p>
<blockquote><p>Muhima, What does this mean for dropshipping? How much does it cost to split test in dropshipping?</p></blockquote>
<p>Lets say you’re testing a clothing product for $40. What’s 50 conversions? Oh SHIT. $2000?</p>
<p>HOLY SHIT. You need $2000+ just run ONE split test?</p>
<p>Oh man.</p>
<p>Are you starting to see why you need a BIG budget to really learn marketing with dropshipping?</p>
<p>You’re only learning marketing if you’re doing split tests — everything else is just throwing shit at the wall. You don’t&nbsp;<em>really</em> know what works. It’s just guesswork.</p>
<h2><span id="B)_The_learning_curve_for_dropshipping_is_extremely_steep,_due_to_many_skills_required_(i_e_many_moving_parts)"></span>B) The learning curve for dropshipping is extremely steep, due to many skills required (i.e. many moving parts)<span></span></h2>
<p>Compared to this other business model I ended up switching to, there are MANY moving parts in dropshipping.</p>
<p>If you’re new to internet marketing, it’s going to be difficult to troubleshoot. As a professional software engineer, oh man. Add just one moving part, and the complexity of your project may have doubled or tripled.</p>
<p>Yes there are people who’ve succeeded with dropshipping, but it’s not easy for a beginner to pickup.</p>
<p>Here’s a running list of skills you need to succeed in dropshipping:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Writing ads</strong>. You have to know what makes a good image/video. You have to learn how to write click baity titles (since you’re bidding CPM, not CPC). If you want to do a good job, you should learn how to spy on competitor’s ads and how to analyze them.</li>
<li><strong>Writing pre-sales landing page</strong>. Chances are pretty good you’re not writing pre-sales page if you’re a newbie. And no, “product description” does NOT count, SMH guys. I’m talking something like a survey lander, or just a good old sales letter with a headline and some inspirational story “This 95 year old woman feels like a 20 year old doing yoga on this yoga mat!”</li>
<li><strong>Writing the sales funnel</strong>. Are you going to be doing free+shipping or straight up product sale with $20+ margin? How are you going to do upsells? Downsells? Cross sells?</li>
<li><strong>Monetizing backend with emails</strong>. With Facebook CPMs on the rise, I saw a lot of marketers adapt by taking a slight loss on the frontend offer and try to make it up in the backend. LTV man. Well if you’re a newbie – oh man. It’s tough.</li>
<li><strong>Building out a professional, branded-looking website</strong>. Hopefully this is the easier part for you. But there are still many who find the task of building out a Shopify website daunting.</li>
<li><strong>Scaling a winner when you have one</strong>. This is the easier part. But still easy to fuck up if you’re not careful.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are you a newbie? Take a quick pause and look at what you have to figure out.</p>
<p>There’s like at least 5 variables you have to troubleshoot or test.</p>
<p>Really tough learning curve. Very steep.</p>
<h2><span id="C)_A_lot_of_headaches_come_with_doing_big_sale_numbers_on_dropshipping"></span>C) A lot of headaches come with doing big sale numbers on dropshipping<span></span></h2>
<p>Lets say you’ve got a winner and you’re trying to scale it as hard as you can.</p>
<p>Congrats! That’s an accomplishment! (And also sure to be short-lived — grab as much as you can before competition comes in).</p>
<p>But wait, there’s more challenges!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Paypal withholding</strong>. Paypal has a reputation for suddenly closing your account. Just like Stripe, they’re wary of dropshippers.There was a funny joke I read on Reddit about this. Some guy said he had $20,000 in his Paypal and another guy says: “How are your balls so big, I can’t even imagine” LOL.</li>
<li><strong>Stripe will close your account</strong> if they find out you are dropshipping, even if your refund rate is less than 1%. Dropshipping is against their Terms of Service. How will you get another Stripe account? And all the money in the Stripe account goes poof. It’s not yours anymore.</li>
<li><strong>Refunds will come. High refund fees.</strong> You have to pay a $20 chargeback fee&nbsp;<em>in addition</em> to a full refund.</li>
<li><strong>Bad cash flow</strong>. Paypal/Stripe may keep a healthy reserve of your funds, for about 60-90 days. Your FB ads (which is your primary cost) is billed monthly. So this is bad for your cash flow.</li>
<li><strong>Need to hire customer support agency</strong>. Eats into your profit margin. Or else you spend hours each day answering customer support emails.</li>
</ul>
<p>Long story short, it’s tough to make dropshipping a truly passive business. You definitely need to dedicate at least a few hours a day to tending the garden so to speak.</p>

				</header>

				<h2 id="the-common-approach"><a href="#the-common-approach">The Common Approach</a></h2>
				<p>The common approach to JWT authentication seems to be using a short-lived JWT in javascript's memory and a longer-lived JWT in an HTTPOnly cookie for re-issuing the in-memory token after it's expired. The security benefits of this have never made much sense to me since the cookie's token can just be used to retrieve an in-memory token itself. More work with no benefit.</p>

				<p>The longer-lived token for re-issuing the short-lived token generally contains information for invalidating the session. This means session access cannot be <em>guaranteed</em> revoked for however long the short-lived token is potentially active.</p>

				<h2 id="the-best-of-both-worlds-approach"><a href="#the-best-of-both-worlds-approach">The Best of Both Worlds Approach</a></h2>
				<p>This approach allows for fast throughput requests and infrastructure savings by reducing database lookups to "dangerous" actions while allowing session revocation before any dangerous action is performed.</p>

				<p>What's a dangerous action? That's up to you and your app needs to determine. While developing this approach any Create, Update, or Delete action or token re-issue was considered dangerous, while any Read action is safe enough that they're allowed during the short-lived token's window without verification.</p>

				<p>This means any revoked session will have, at most, minutes to view the account, but cannot alter any data associated with it.</p>

                <h2 id="the-basics"><a href="#the-basics">The Basics</a></h2>				<p>This is the basic setup:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Data stored in token:
						<ul>
							<li>Short lived expiration time.</li>
							<li>User ID.</li>
							<li>Session ID.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>JWT stored in HTTPOnly cookie.</li>
					<li>Session ID is a "shared session" stored in user database.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2 id="the-implementation"><a href="#the-implementation">The Implementation:</a></h2>
				<h3 id="jwt-cookie"><a href="#jwt-cookie">JWT Cookie</a></h3>				<p>Storing the JWT in an HTTPOnly cookie allows us to create a persistent, hidden from javascript authentication method. Attaching it as credentials to our requests will mean needing to implement cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection, but we won't dive into that here because of the many possible solutions depending on your needs.</p>

				<h3 id="shared-sessions"><a href="#shared-sessions">Shared Sessions</a></h3>				<p>By creating a unique ID session field on each user we eliminate the need to store a separate session database/table that stores multiple sessions for each user depending on device, browser, etc. The shared session ID is deemed a current valid session until it is changed in the database. This is how we'll revoke sessions.</p>

				<p>This means we'll have to revoke all sessions associated with a single account rather than individual sessions, but this is usually the general approach anyways.</p>

				<h3 id="revoking-sessions"><a href="#revoking-sessions">Revoking Sessions</a></h3>				<p>What reasons can we use to revoke sessions? Password changes, compromised account detection, and more. When we need to invalidate a session, we simply need to generate a new session ID for the user in the database. All currently issued tokens will be invalid for re-issue or unsafe actions.</p>

				<h3 id="user-id"><a href="#user-id">User ID</a></h3>                <p>By storing the user's ID in the token we can implicitly trust for any safe action that the user of a valid, unexpired token is who they say they are, and should have access to the account data associated with the ID.</p>
				
				<p>This will save a database lookup for every safe action performed. A possibly large accumulation over time with a speedup for the user on each safe request as well.</p>

				<h3 id="expiration"><a href="#expiration">Expiration</a></h3>				<p>With a short-lived expiration we can re-verify valid sessions as soon as a token expires, limiting the window revoked sessions have to safe actions as well.</p>

				<p>Rather than having a separate token for re-issuing the short-lived token we can just use the expired token + its session ID to verify it should be re-issued.</p>

				<p>We check the database that the session ID is still valid, compare the issued time against a longer window of time and if both are accepted issue a new short-lived cookie token.</p>

				<p>Most JWT implementations (like node-jsonwebtoken) make this easy by throwing an expiration specific error on validation, and then a method for decoding the token while ignoring the expiration:</p>

				<pre><code>
				verify(token, 'secret').catch((err) =&gt; {
					if (err.name === 'TokenExpiredError') {
						// Check against re-issue time window &amp; validate session ID
						return validateSessionAndReissue(token);
					}
				});
				</code></pre>

				<p>This way our single token can "re-issue" itself when needed.</p>

				<h2 id="considerations"><a href="#considerations">Considerations:</a></h2>
				<h3 id="the-jwt-window"><a href="#the-jwt-window">The JWT Window</a></h3>				<p>If you need instantly revocable sessions for all requests and can't deem any safe vs unsafe then a JWT isn't the solution for you at all. Classic sessions stored in a cookie are smaller in size, will use the same number of DB lookups, and are often easier to implement.</p>

				<h3 id="server-side-handling"><a href="#server-side-handling">Server Side Handling</a></h3>				<p>Your server implementation may need to accommodate the approach in several ways. The user's ID will typically be attached to the request as included credentials from the token rather than included as an argument/parameter or REST endpoint. This can be nice since endpoints, graphQL queries, etc. can be simplified.</p>

				<p>Different actions/resources will need to be marked as safe for implicit trust and some for unsafe requiring explicit validated session trust. This may be a higher order function around different routes or resolvers.</p>

                <h3 id="a-single-session"><a href="#a-single-session">A Single Session</a></h3>				<p>If your security needs to track/differentiate between two sessions under a single account then a shared session likely over complicates the fingerprinting you'd want to attach to actions and classic sessions are probably a better choice.</p>

				<h2 id="in-summary"><a href="#in-summary">In Summary</a></h2>				<p>This approach has the same security implications as most JWT implementations, but offers more safety around certain actions giving the performance and infrastructure benefits of the normal JWT approach for all other actions. And the single JWT being responsible for re-issuing itself reduces complexity greatly.</p>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    
<p>I’ve spent about a year ramping up on reinforcement learning (RL) and related research topics. Compared to my PhD work at Berkeley, my current research is less focused on publishing and more independent, creating unique challenges and rewards. I want to share some tips for effective self-study and independent research, which are roughly ordered from those targeting early research first to more mature research later.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Write down your goals.</strong> Do you want to publish a paper? Contribute to an open source project? Gain experience for a career change? Do you simply enjoy learning? You can list more than one goal, but sort them and <em>pick one as your primary.</em> When I started, my primary goal was to learn about as many approaches to agent based programs as I could find, and a secondary goal was to build an agent that uses mind-wandering (which led me to build a chat bot).</li>
  <li><strong>Mix learning and practicing.</strong> I learn by reading, watching videos, taking online classes, and participating in study groups. I practice by coding. A 1:1 ratio works well for me. I usually spend days or weeks in one mode before switching to the other.</li>
  <li><strong>Regularly read classic papers.</strong> Get to know the history of the field and the key figures. Often what they’ve done is worth trying yourself, or will influence your direction.</li>
  <li><strong>Start or join a reading group.</strong> This helps with motivation and learning. Don’t overdo it: start with one paper or textbook chapter per month, adjust later if necessary. Take notes each time and consider posting them online.</li>
  <li><strong>Write down your research plan.</strong> Don’t overthink it, this is just a starting spot. It doesn’t have to be long. I keep mine in a google doc. I re-read and update it frequently. It starts high-level and aspirational and gets more detailed. Here are some sections my plan contains (yours can be much shorter!):
    <ul>
      <li>One sentence research hypothesis.</li>
      <li>Objectives - one line per each of my 3mo / 6mo / 1yr / 2yr objectives. I review and revise this section every three months.</li>
      <li>Draft abstract + intro of a hypothetical research paper (dissertation?) that I hope to some day write if my research works out.</li>
      <li>Learning plan / courses to take.</li>
      <li>Reading list &amp; related work.</li>
      <li>FAQ. Brainstorm questions that you expect to encounter, both from others and yourself. Since I shifted from lots of structure in my previous role to less structure in my current role, my FAQ includes questions like <em>“why am i doing this?”</em> and <em>“what possible obstacles do I expect?”</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Revisit and evolve your goals.</strong> My high-level goals evolve slowly, but my lower-level ones change a lot. I enjoy looking back and seeing how they’ve changed as I learned new things.</li>
  <li><strong>Conduct self-performance reviews.</strong> Independent work has little intrinsic structure. I force structure on myself: every three months I write down where I can improve the most, and what I’m most proud of. In fact, this blog post is part of my 1yr performance review.</li>
  <li><strong>Keep a research journal.</strong> Try to write daily. I keep my journal at the end of my research plan, and this blog is an experiment in shifting some of my journaling to be public.</li>
  <li><strong>Don’t worry about novelty.</strong> It is valuable to implement well known algorithms yourself. Remember to cite the author if you publish your code or anything derivitive.</li>
  <li><strong>Build small projects.</strong> Apply what you’re learning. Spend hours (not days) making a 1-2 page design doc including a 1 sentence summary of the project, 1-3 paragraphs of overview, and a bullet list of the initial features. Spend weeks (not months) building the first prototype of a project, then iterate. Some friends and I spent a couple months <a href="https://github.com/andyk/improved-funicular">implementing 2048 and a bunch of algos to play it</a>; it was motivating and we learned a lot. I also built a chat bot, a small python library of utility functions for writing RL algorithms, and a few other small projects.</li>
  <li><strong>Write up your progress.</strong> When you’ve finished a project or reached a checkpoint, take a few hours to write up your results and some reflections. It doesn’t have to be polished. My friends and I documented some of our results and lessons learned working on 2048 in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oNbpl-4W6jaOg4DefeQPYh77wpbNfZwzI5t86mra3hs/edit">a shared google doc</a>. Now we have the option to come back later and iterate on it, maybe even work towards publishing it somewhere.</li>
  <li><strong>Teach what you learn.</strong> Prepare a short talk, or even better a short hands-on training tutorial. Give it at a meetup or put it on YouTube. If you’re not ready for that, give it for your friends.</li>
  <li><strong>Allow yourself to explore tangents.</strong> But time box them, and if possible, try to synthesize lessons from the tangent back into your research plan.</li>
  <li><strong>Find folks to collaborate with.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Look where you work. For academics, this is straightforward, e.g., PhD students have their advisors and other students. If you’re not an academic, there might already be reading groups or chat channels at your company you can join. Otherwise, attend meetups, post on mailing lists of open source projects, or go to a conference.</li>
      <li>Once you find a collaborator, some of your solo activites can become group activities. I work closely with a friend Nick Jalbert that I met in grad school. We have weekly video chats and occasionally in-person mini-retreats. Here are examples of ways Nick and I collaborate:
        <ul>
          <li>Every few weeks, we read a paper and then meet to discuss it. Nick inspired me to set up this blog when he started posting <a href="https://nickjalbert.github.io/reading">his reading notes</a> online.</li>
          <li>We built a short hands-on <a href="https://www.meetup.com/LA-Deep-RL/events/268096321/">Intro to RL tutorial</a> for the LA Deep RL meetup group.</li>
          <li>We are self-studying our way through <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/">Gilbert Strang’s online linear algebra course</a>.</li>
          <li>We write code together. Sometimes we both work on our own separate implementation of an algorithm and then compare, sometimes we review each other’s code or design docs, and sometimes we pair program.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Contact people in the field.</strong> Be bold but humble. Don’t start with the most famous researchers; instead contact folks that are local to your area. Read their recent papers or books first. Get an introduction if you can. Raise a technical topic or question that overlaps with their research. Researchers are generally meritocratic, so they will give you time if you have ideas that are interesting to them. Nonetheless, expect to be rejected or ignored.</li>
  <li><strong>Spend time motivating yourself.</strong> I once read that people overestimate how much progress they can make in a month and underestimate how much they can make in a year;&nbsp;this is my experience with self-study and independent research. Major research accomplishments tend to take years of work (Is this kinda counter to the underestimting progress in a year thing?). Along the way, you should expect to ocassionally feel bored, distracted, hopeless, disillusioned, etc. I don’t wait for these moments to arrive to manage them. Instead, I proactively set aside time for activities that inspire me. For me, this includes reading or watching sci-fi, public speaking, and passionate conversations with friends about RL and AI. And when a bad day comes along, I take a break from work, listen to music or go the gym, talk it out with a friend, or try jumping into a different project. All the while, I remain patient for my sense of excitement to return. And it always does.</li>
</ul>

<p>Have fun and good luck with your research and studying.</p>

<p>To counter a second coronavirus wave, President Aleksandar Vucic announced a new lockdown. Protesters reacted with fury at his inconsistency, amid wider anger over his strongman leadership.</p>
<p>Thousands of Serbs demonstrated for a second consecutive night on Wednesday in response to President Aleksandar Vucic’s management of the coronavirus crisis and wider concerns over the state of democracy in Serbia.</p>
<p>The protests were the first major pandemic-related unrest in Europe since the start of the crisis and were met by a violent police response that some analysts said they had not witnessed in Serbia since the rule of Slobodan Milosevic, who governed Serbia during the 1990s.</p>
<p>Serbs first took to the streets on Tuesday, soon after Mr. Vucic announced that Belgrade would be placed under a new three-day lockdown following the second wave of confirmed coronavirus infections.</p>
<p>But the demonstrations quickly morphed into a wider expression of frustration at Mr. Vucic’s increasing control over policymaking and perceived mismanagement of Serbia’s pandemic response. The protests continued on Wednesday, even after Mr. Vucic suspended his decision to enforce a second shutdown.</p>
<p>Protesters said they were less angry about the re-implementation of the lockdown than the governmental missteps that had created the need for renewed restrictions in the first place. These included decisions to proceed with a general election last week and to restart large public sports events.</p>
<p>“We don’t mind staying home for another three days — that wasn’t the problem,” said Dragana Grncarski, 45, a fashion events manager who protested on both days.</p>
<p>“However, they’re playing with our minds and with the truth,” Ms. Grncarski added. “When it suits them to do elections, there is no corona. They organized football matches and tennis matches, and because of that we have a situation where the hospitals are full.”</p>
<p>After initially enforcing one of Europe’s strictest lockdowns in March, Mr. Vucic lifted social restrictions in early May, claiming his government had defeated the coronavirus.</p>
<p>But while other European countries eased their lockdowns gradually, Mr. Vucic opted for a faster process, soon allowing Serbs to gather by the tens of thousands without social distancing at sports matches and to crowd into reopened nightclubs.</p>
<p>“We went from one extreme to another,” said Jelena Vasiljevic, an expert on Balkan protest movements at the University of Belgrade.</p>
<p>Mr. Vucic initially refused to change course on the re-openings, even as the daily number of new cases rose from below 20 to above 300 and investigative news reports suggested that the toll could be even higher.</p>
<p>He pressed ahead with a controversial general election on June 21 that most opposition parties had long planned to boycott, saying they did not want to legitimize a process that they feel is gamed in Mr. Vucic’s favor.</p>
<p>And to Mr. Vucic’s critics, his decision first to ease restrictions ahead of a vote that was certain to increase his power — and then reinstate them soon after — felt like he was playing politics with public health.</p>
<p>“Citizens have been constantly deceived and lied to for political ends,” said Tena Prelec, an expert on politics in Southeast Europe at the University of Oxford.</p>
<p>Analysts said the spontaneous nature of the protests reflected the lack of institutional means to express dissent.</p>
<p>Under Mr. Vucic, the quality of Serbian democracy has fallen from “free” to only “partly free,” according to Freedom House, an independent Washington-based watchdog that makes an annual assessment of each country’s political freedoms.</p>
<p>“The media and state institutions are completely consumed by one party,” said Dr. Vasiljevic.</p>
<p>On Tuesday night, some protesters briefly entered the Parliament building before being forced out by police.</p>
<p>Law enforcement officials were later filmed beating unarmed protesters with batons, in scenes that some analysts said mirrored police behavior during the rule of Mr. Milosevic, who led Serbia through the Balkan Wars and was later tried for war crimes in The Hague.</p>
<p>“The excessive use of force — we haven’t seen that since Milosevic in 1996 or 1997,” Dr. Vasiljevic said.</p>
<p>Mr. Vucic said police were right to respond with force.</p>
<p>“There were indications of foreign involvement, and some criminal faces were there, too,” Mr. Vucic said, speaking on Wednesday afternoon, before the second night of protests.</p>
<p>“The aim was to damage Serbia’s international image,” he added.</p>
<p>The protests could soon fizzle because of their leaderless nature, the lack of a clear goal, and the strength of Mr. Vucic’s grip on Serbia, Dr. Vasiljevic said.</p>
<p>Similar mass demonstrations dissipated last year without forcing concessions from Mr. Vucic.</p>
<p>“This situation is a bit different,” said Dr. Vasiljevic. “But we still need to have some clear political articulations and a clear political narrative.”</p>

<h3 id="what-does-a-web-server-do">What does a web server do?</h3>

<p>It listens on a TCP port for connections. When someone from somewhere on the internet makes a connection to that port, it happily recieves the “request”, processes it, and sends a “response”.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-modern-web-development">What is “modern” web development?</h3>

<p>Modern web development refers to the prevalent web development practices right now. I’m writing this in 2020, and right now web development revolves around the concepts of “frontend” and “backend”. Let’s rewind a bit.</p>

<p>Long ago, web development was about creating pages in HTML which gets transmitted over the wire to browser which then displays it. People could click and navigate to other pages. But that was mostly it. Everything was static and everyone would see the same things.</p>

<p>Then “dynamic” web came into existence. Here, “web servers” would create HTML pages on the fly depending on the user who is requesting it. “Users” could also add/remove content from these servers. There was a lot of “data” moving around and naturally databases became prominent. Also, languages like PHP which allowed dynamically creating HTML became popular.</p>

<p>Then came the smartphones. With smartphones came “native apps” and also smaller screens. This was a double blow to web development. One, websites now have to be visually attractive on large screens and small screens (responsive design). Two, websites would have to compete with the interactivity offered by native applications. Although responsive design has largely been a successful change in web development, competing with native applications is something web applications are still struggling in. This is partly because native code on Android and iOS simply have more capabilities on the platform. Thus the term “native”.</p>

<p>That is what drives the differentiation between frontend and backend in modern web development. Large organizations have native applications for each platform and web version of their applications. This means that the “backend” server can be the lowest common factor - which is “REST APIs”. And the UI on different platforms are their own codebases. For the web, the UI is called frontend. Large organizations also drive innovation and technology. And therefore most of the popular web technologies we have now is devoted to this frontend-backend divide.</p>

<p>On the frontend javascript is the default choice and that is why popular frontend frameworks like React and Vue are all also javascript frameworks.</p>

<p>But backend can be anything. Javascript itself, python, java, rust, kotlin, go, ruby, php, or even <a href="https://css-tricks.com/wtf-is-a-static-api/">just JSON files</a>. The only requirement for a backend technology, as can be seen from that last example, is that it is able to return strings over a web connection. Most applications would also have to interact with databases, other internet services (APIs), and the filesystem, and also encapsulate “business logic”. And that is where things become interesting.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-javas-role-in-modern-web-development">What is Java’s role in modern web development?</h3>

<p>No matter how much stuff happens on the frontend, centralized services will have a backend with components that I described previously. Even if things are dockerized and deployed on the cloud thus giving rise to multiple “backends”, there is something at the “back”.</p>

<p>Java, over the last few years has been evolving rapidly (compared to its own past) to accomodate the needs of modern web development. Because the JVM is battle tested and because the development paradigms that Java enforces are also useful for large teams to work together, Java is a powerful player in the backend space of modern web development.</p>

<h3 id="what-should-i-know-about-java-to-understand-modern-web-development-in-java">What should I know about Java to understand modern web development in Java?</h3>

<h4 id="specifications-vs-implementations">Specifications vs Implementations</h4>

<p>The biggest insight I can share is that in Java world <strong>everything has specifications</strong> and implementations. “Specification”/standards are API interfaces (usually), configuration formats, or expected behaviour that are meant to be interoperable. (This plays well with the concept of <code>Interface</code> in Java’s object-oriented paradigm)</p>

<p>What this means is that you could write software that targets a specification and then it could work with any of the implementations of that specification. This is a concept very much alien to javascript developers.</p>

<p>For a concrete example, let us take the case of REST API development. If you are building a framework that simplifies development of REST APIs in javascript, you can build it however the way you want. Then you write documentation on how the user of your framework should write their functions such that it can be hooked into your framework. For example, <a href="https://expressjs.com/">express</a> developer would want you to write a function like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>/</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>req</span><span>,</span> <span>h</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>h</span><span>.</span><span>send</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>Hello World!</span><span>'</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But, <a href="https://hapi.dev/">hapi</a> will ask you to write the same like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>route</span><span>({</span>
        <span>method</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>GET</span><span>'</span><span>,</span>
        <span>path</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>/</span><span>'</span><span>,</span>
        <span>handler</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>req</span><span>,</span> <span>h</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

            <span>return</span> <span>'</span><span>Hello World!</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So, as a user, you get locked in to the framework early on.</p>

<p>But in Java, this is not necessarily the case. There is “<a href="https://download.oracle.com/javaee-archive/jax-rs-spec.java.net/jsr339-experts/att-3593/spec.pdf">JAX-RS</a>” [pdf link] specification which talks about how the user will write their classes and methods, how these will be annotated, how the configuration will be specified, and so on. The specification also tells you how your framework should behave when interacting with such user code as well.</p>

<p>So, no matter whether you’re using <a href="https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey/">Jersey</a>, <a href="https://resteasy.github.io/docs/">RESTEasy</a>, or any other JAX-RS compliant framework, your method will be the same:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>@Path</span><span>(</span><span>"/"</span><span>)</span>
<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>HelloWorld</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>@GET</span>
	<span>public</span> <span>String</span> <span>helloWorld</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    	<span>return</span> <span>"Hello World!"</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can write this and deploy it with Jersey and it will work. You can then remove Jersey and put something else that implements JAX-RS, it will work. That is what a standard does.</p>

<p>Now, this does not mean that Java is a boring place where everyone writes programs the same way. There are other REST frameworks that do not conform to the JAX-RS specification like <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web.html#mvc">Spring MVC</a>
and they can have their own ways of how to write web resource classes.</p>

<h4 id="did-i-mention-specifications">Did I mention specifications?</h4>

<p>Java has to be understood in its historical context. Java was under Oracle for a long long time. And Oracle used to provide various cloud services that uses Java based technologies. And Oracle used to maintain the specifications in and around Java. And Oracle used to provide proprietary technologies on top of these specifications.</p>

<p>The proliferation of such specifications (which no other programming language seems to have) is good and bad. Bad because it makes a programming language an economic product rather than a language of creative expression. Good because you can move your enterprise from one provider to another, provided they both support the same specifications equally. Enterprises love this promise of not being vendor locked in. It is just an added bonus to them that they can swap developers around constantly because everyone is practically writing the same thing.</p>

<p>So, the story of specifications doesn’t end with specifications. Java also has collections of specifications. There is something called “Standard Edition” (SE), something called “Enterprise Edition” (EE). SE “contains” the basic things that makes it a programming language (like data types, IO, etc.) whereas EE “contains” further things like the JAX-RS specification we mentioned above. Meaning, if you have a cloud provider who implements the Java EE platform, then there are a lot of specifications that they are complying with (almost all the technologies that an enterprise needs).</p>

<p>On the other hand there are also projects like <a href="https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.microprofile">Eclipse MicroProfile</a> which form useful alternatives to things like Java EE. There are also frameworks like <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework">Spring</a>, <a href="https://micronaut.io/">Micronaut</a>, and <a href="https://quarkus.io/">Quarkus</a> which are comprehensive solutions of their own (often with interchangeable parts).</p>

<p>That ends part 1 of this post. Have a coffee now.</p>

<h3 id="tell-me-about-web-development-in-java">Tell me about web development in Java</h3>

<p>I’m sorry it has to be this way. Much of Java is stuck in the past. And without the historical context, you will have great trouble in navigating the Java ecosystem. I’ve spent countless nights doing this. Just show some patience.</p>

<h3 id="history-of-web-development-in-java">History of Web Development in Java</h3>

<p>Java has seen all of it. So we have to start from the very beginning.</p>

<h4 id="servlets">Servlets</h4>

<p>A servlet is very similar to the hello world function in express that we saw earlier.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>ServletHelloWorld</span> <span>extends</span> <span>HttpServlet</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>@Override</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>init</span><span>(</span><span>final</span> <span>ServletConfig</span> <span>config</span><span>)</span> <span>throws</span> <span>ServletException</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>super</span><span>.</span><span>init</span><span>(</span><span>config</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>

    
    <span>@Override</span>
    <span>protected</span> <span>void</span> <span>service</span><span>(</span><span>final</span> <span>HttpServletRequest</span> <span>request</span><span>,</span> <span>final</span> <span>HttpServletResponse</span> <span>response</span><span>)</span> <span>throws</span> <span>ServletException</span><span>,</span> <span>IOException</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>response</span><span>.</span><span>getWriter</span><span>().</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello World!"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
 
    <span>@Override</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>destroy</span><span>()</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That is a hello world servlet.  The request object would have information about path and other info required to form a response.</p>

<p><a href="https://javaee.github.io/servlet-spec/">Java Servlet Specification</a> is the specification that defines how servlets should be.</p>

<h4 id="servlet-containers">Servlet Containers</h4>

<p>These are frameworks which, based on the servlet specification, are designed to run servlets. An example is “Catalina” which is a part of Tomcat.</p>

<h4 id="web-servers">Web servers</h4>

<p><a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat</a> is a group of technologies which could be considered a complete “web server”. Tomcat includes components like “Coyote” which listens to a port for HTTP connections, and Catalina mentioned above which takes that request and forwards it to a servlet and later takes the response from the servlet and passes it back.</p>

        <blockquote><p>Gartner says hyper-automation is one of the top 10 trends of the year – but what the heck is it?</p></blockquote>
<p>Initially, hyper-automation sounds like yet another buzzword. But analysts say hyper-automation is a thing unto itself, and they suggest businesses pay attention to it. Great. But then, what <em>is</em> it?</p>
<p>One reason that hyper-automation is difficult to recognize is that it has many names. Gartner calls it hyper-automation, and considers it <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-10-strategic-technology-trends-for-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the top trends</a> of the year. IDC calls it <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=IDC_P35141" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intelligent Process automation</a> while Forrester dubs the same practices <a href="https://go.forrester.com/blogs/digital-process-automation-an-important-part-of-your-digital-transformation-strategy/%20target=">Digital Process Automation</a>. Still others do not call it by any name at all.</p>
<p>“We created the first of its kind hyper-automation tool for project management. We don’t present it that way because people don’t yet understand and really know about hyper-automation,” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregorystoos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">says Grégory Stoos</a>, a French entrepreneur who founded Portuguese startup <a href="https://planless.io/%20target=">planless.io</a>.</p>
<h3>No clear name, but it’s a real thing</h3>
<p>While the name is still a bit in flux, the definition has already gelled.</p>
<p>According to Gartner, hyper-automation “involves a combination of tools, including <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/rpa-robot-process-automation-how-it-relates-to-intelligent-automation/">robotic process automation</a> (RPA), intelligent business management software (iBPMS) and AI, with a goal of increasingly AI-driven decision making.” The firm further clarifies that “hyper-automation often results in the creation of a digital twin of the organization (DTO)” which in turn enables &nbsp;organizations “to visualize how functions, processes and key performance indicators interact to drive value.”</p>
<p>In short, you can think of hyper-automation as automated automation. It always functions at high speeds and often (though not always) at large scale.</p>
<p>“Hyper-automation enables machines to automate the further implementation of additional automation without the input of human assistance. It is often said that machines running on this type of technology can not only learn 10,000 times faster, they can do so without ever missing it on the next iteration,” says Nate Nead, CEO of <a href="https://dev.co/">DEV.co</a>, a custom software development company.</p>
<p>While it is used in several industries, it is not generally widespread.</p>
<p>“Hyper-automation is yet to become mainstream, but adoption is growing. My observation is based on the fact that even in call centers, despite its usefulness, hyper-automation is yet to become a staple,” said Reuben Yonatan, founder and CEO of <a href="https://getvoip.com/">GetVoIP</a>, an advisor service on cloud communications.</p>
<h3>A few current examples</h3>
<p>Today, use cases are typically in early stages, particularly in contexts where you would expect heavy automation. A common goal is accelerating, streamlining, and even redesigning processes.</p>
<p>“A real-world example of hyper-automation in my industry—cloud communication—is the use of RPA and AI in call centers to automate processes such as mouse clicks and application launch to help an agent quickly pull information about a client from multiple systems,” explains Yonatan.</p>
<p>“When a customer calls in, an agent must aggregate information from various systems to get a complete customer profile. With the hyper-automation tools handling the process, the agent doesn’t have to keep switching between several applications, and the process is faster,” Yonatan adds.</p>
<p>Implementations vary significantly, depending in large part on where and why hyper-automation is used. That is likely to remain true for the foreseeable future too.</p>
<p>“Traditional areas where such AI tools will truly skyrocket in the next decade include database search querying, project automation, CRM, ERP systems, fulfillment and tracking of things like leads, people, processes and packages. As machines learn faster and make less mistakes then humans, it is estimated that most jobs will be automated in 20 years or less,” says Nead.</p>
<p>Wyndham Capital Mortgage, which <a href="https://www.aifoundry.com/newsroom/news/wyndham-capital-mortgage-partners-with-ai-foundry-for-lending-ai-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">entered a partnership</a> with AI Foundry in May, is another example of a company using hyper-automation to automate where automation couldn’t go before.</p>
<p>“Wyndham Capital Mortgage’s strategy is to be a leader in the utilization of automation and particularly robotic processing technologies,” said Wyndham Capital Mortgage CEO Jeff Douglas in <a href="https://www.aifoundry.com/newsroom/news/wyndham-capital-mortgage-partners-with-ai-foundry-for-lending-ai-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a statement</a> to the press. “By implementing [AI Foundry’s] Agile Mortgages’ cognitive robots, we are now able to push deeper into loan processing stages where document and decision complexity limited automation gains.”</p>
<p>In short, Wyndham is accelerating its loan origination process and jacking up scale too. Part of that is achieved by using robots to fetch information from a variety of sources, thereby <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/5-reasons-why-qa-needs-humans/">eliminating menial work</a> typically done by operations employees.</p>
<p>“Wyndham Capital Mortgage has been utilizing RPA for some time. Integration of AI Foundry’s solutions moves it to hyper-automation,” explains <a href="https://bryan.uncg.edu/faculty-and-staff/kshetri-nir-b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nir Kshetri</a>, a professor at University of North Carolina-Greensboro and a research fellow at Kobe University.</p>
<p>The move to hyper-automation was necessary because RPA alone is insufficient to fully automate the loan origination process. Wyndham needed a technological fix for RPA’s gaps and shortcomings.</p>
<p>“RPA perform well in automating predefined steps in which rules define where relevant data can be located on each type of pre-defined document – for example, [tax] form 1040 and statements from some predefined banks. However, RPA may not deliver the automation goals if different customers submit documents in different formats with different contents. By utilizing [machine learning] and machine vision financial institutions such as Wyndham Capital Mortgage can extract relevant information from diverse documents,” Kshetri adds.</p>
<p>Even though it hasn’t gone mainstream yet, hyper-automation is in common enough use that consultancies are already organizing guidance for their clientele.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://theartofservice.com/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Art of Service</a>, a management consultancy company based in Australia, frequently releases updated and new assessments of hyper-automation based on hundreds of projects and initiatives according to CEO and R&amp;D Director, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gerardblokdijk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gerard Blokdyk</a>. Gartner, IDC, Forrester and other firms also provide guidance and projections.</p>
<p>That’s a lot of attention for a group of technologies that’s yet to entirely settle on a name. And <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/things-that-are-called-ml-ai-that-really-arent/">at least it’s a real thing</a>. In the meantime, think of hyper-automation as a swiftly laid foundation for businesses keen on future-building rather than future-proofing.</p>

Although computers were always part of his household growing up, he thought they were boring, and he told his family he would “never study computer science.”</p><p>Instead, Douglas went to USC to study filmmaking, thinking he’d follow his dream of becoming a film director. Soon, he realized that filmmaking school wasn’t all he’d imagined it would be, and he took up classical guitar instead. From there, he accidentally discovered a passion for theoretical physics, which he found fascinating (and which paid more than guitar playing).</p><p>Not long after, Douglas discovered his interest in data science and climbed the ranks until he was heading engineering and data science teams at Twitter, Pinterest, and AWS. He describes working in the field as feeling like he’s living in a science fiction film.</p><blockquote>“When I work on that kind of stuff, I feel like Doctor Strange — as if I’m in the Multiverse. You actually get to live this Rick and Morty parallel-universe life.”</blockquote><p>But Douglas wasn’t content with using his expertise to improve revenue at large corporations, so he went on to found his own business, Koyote Science. He’s currently focused on building COVID-19 models to predict outbreaks.</p><h2><strong>Lessons learned from shipping machine learning projects</strong></h2><p>Douglas’s success hasn’t come without some hard-earned lessons. He told us about some of the challenges he’s seen across many of the teams and projects he’s worked on.</p><h3><strong>Lesson 1: Use machine learning to work with users instead of taking over&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>At Twitter, Douglas worked on a feature called “who to follow.” This gives Twitter users personalized recommendations about which accounts might be interesting for them. As a data scientist, Douglas discovered that people used this feature a lot. At first, it seemed great — people were following nearly everyone it recommended. But in the longer term, people who used this feature <strong>visited Twitter less</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Their feeds were filled with tweets chosen <strong>by an algorithm</strong>, rather than tweets from people they chose<strong> </strong>themselves.</p><p>By reducing<strong> </strong>the number of “who to follow” recommendations, Douglas improved <strong>long-term</strong> engagement.</p><p>It’s common knowledge that long-term and short-term goals often conflict, but Douglas discovered a deeper lesson here. As machine learning solutions become more capable, it’s often tempting to use them to do too much. This is almost always a mistake. Douglas says:</p><blockquote>“I aim to build products that work with the user rather than trying to take over from the user.”</blockquote><p>AI as depicted in science fiction — with human-level intelligence — is probably to blame for the fact that many people try to <strong>do too much </strong>with machine learning. In many cases, it’s best used to <strong>augment </strong>human actions rather than replace them.</p><h3><strong>Lesson 2: Data pipelines and good engineering are more important than math and algorithms</strong></h3><p>People get very excited about <strong>new machine learning algorithms</strong>. First we had neural networks (NNs), then convolutional neural networks (CNNs), then generative adversarial networks (GANs), transformers, and more. Algorithms are fun and exciting to talk about and explore.</p><p>But Douglas, a self-confessed math nerd, has learned that the math and algorithms tend to get far too much attention, while real success comes from <strong>good data, good engineering, focusing on the customer’s problem, </strong>and <strong>not getting trapped in the math.</strong> He says:</p><blockquote>“It's very, very rare for the algorithm to make the difference. It's almost always the data pipeline. In my work, I have been able to reduce errors by 90% with a data pipeline, compared to 75% with a better algorithm. And yet everyone wants to talk to me about the algorithm, but no one wants to talk about the data pipeline.”</blockquote><p>We use metaphors that associate machine learning algorithms with neuroscientists and data pipelines with plumbing, so it’s not surprising which one grabs popular attention. Douglas found success by focusing on the less glamorous aspects of machine learning. In most cases, deciding <strong>what data to use </strong>and <strong>how to present it to the algorithm</strong> is more important than the algorithm itself.</p><h4>Focus on the customer’s goals</h4><p>Many “AI startups” today talk far more about <strong>the solutions they provide</strong> than the <strong>problems they solve</strong>, and Douglas has learned to maintain a laser focus on customer goals. Sometimes this means pulling himself away from the more enticing theoretical aspects of machine learning. He says:&nbsp;</p><blockquote>“As a mathematician, I love all the nuances of the math, and easily get lost in it. But the reality is that there's an infinite amount of math out there to learn. It's not feasible to lock myself in my room and learn all the math before I focus on customer goals.”</blockquote><p>The truth that many data scientists don’t want to hear is that successful machine learning solutions are not usually about creating something new, powerful, and exciting. More often, seeing problems from the correct angle and using tried and tested approaches is what you need.</p><h4>Work with and learn from experienced engineers</h4><p>Douglas has personally engineered many successful machine learning solutions and led teams of software engineers, but he remains modest about his engineering ability and emphasizes the <a href="https://datarevenue.com/en-blog/hiring-machine-learning-engineers-instead-of-data-scientists">importance of <strong>solid engineering</strong></a>.</p><blockquote>“At Amazon, I let the engineers do as much as possible, because they're better than me at engineering. I would love to give you another answer, but they're efficient, they're thoughtful, they've seen these structures before, so they know about implementation details.”</blockquote><p>It’s not all smooth sailing though. Douglas acknowledges the difficulties of getting different experts to work with each other, especially when highly technical people tend to have very strong opinions about tiny decisions.</p><p>The best way he’s found to get everyone on the same page is by constantly releasing Minimal Viable Products (MVPs), which takes us to our next lesson.</p><h3><strong>Lesson 3: Always build Minimum Viable Products (MVPs)</strong></h3><p>Douglas swears by MVPs, which demonstrate core pieces of a solution, even if many of the features are missing. When developing a machine learning solution, he’ll aim to deliver a new MVP <strong>every week.</strong></p><p>He uses these to:&nbsp;</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Avoid traps: </strong>If a project is taking too long, the difficulty of building even an MVP can be used to argue that the project should be cut early, before years of effort are wasted. Douglas says:</li></ul><p>“If something ends up being way harder and I keep doing MVPs and never reach the goals, then that gives us information about the difficulty of what we're attempting to do.”</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Communicate</strong>: Both technical and non-technical people tend to better understand things they can see and use, rather than abstract ideas.</li></ul><p>“People's response to an abstract concept of something is often completely different to their response when they see something real. That's why I'm always putting out MVPs. People who are looking from a higher-level perspective can gain the required intuition to give me feedback.”</p><p>It’s better to have to trash two weeks of work than two months, and MVPs can help with this.</p><p>MVPs have other benefits too. By releasing stripped-down versions of a solution, Douglas often discovers that less is more.</p><blockquote>“What you end up delivering is often much simpler than the thing you originally intended to do, but it's refined.”</blockquote><p>Of course, customers are sometimes unhappy when it turns out that the best solution was the simplest one. Douglas compares building machine learning solutions to creating art: it’s about the time that went into development, not the effort required for the final product.</p><blockquote>“There’s a classic Zen story about a king who hires an artist. The artist works for a year, but then paints the final painting in only three seconds. When the king complains, the artist says, ‘Oh, I spent a year trying to paint much harder things.’”</blockquote><p>MVPs keep you open to finding a <strong>better, simpler </strong>solution, even late in the development process, and it’s important to stay agile so you can pivot to these better solutions if necessary.</p><p>People often think something has to be <strong>complicated </strong>in order to be <strong>powerful</strong>,<strong> </strong>but in fact the opposite is often true.</p><h3><strong>Lesson 4: Control and precision are more important than size and power</strong></h3><p>Large machine learning models, such as GPT-3, are exciting and often make their way into headline news. But Douglas compares large models to early (failed) attempts to build planes. These planes competed against the famous, successful plane built by the Wright Brothers. What made them different? The Wright Brothers focused on <strong>control</strong>,<strong> </strong>while their competitors were going for <strong>size and power.</strong></p><blockquote>“What the Wright brothers did that was so ingenious was that they didn’t go for bigger engines. They were bicycle mechanics. They didn't even use powerful engines. And instead, what they focused on was control.”</blockquote><p>This is similar to machine learning models. As Douglas says:&nbsp;</p><blockquote>“We made the biggest model that does all this stuff. But then people ask, ‘How do I interpret this stuff?’ ‘How do I control it?’ ‘How do I make sure that my models don't go off the rails?’”</blockquote><p>Large machine learning models might often be more powerful, but unless they solve real problems, they’re not useful. If a model produces amazing results <strong>unpredictably</strong> and only <strong>some of the time</strong>, that’s not useful. If a model produces accurate results but we don’t <strong>understand why</strong> and can’t be sure the results will <strong>always be accurate</strong>, then that’s also not useful.</p><p>Instead, smaller, simpler, and arguably less powerful models that offer more <strong>interpretability</strong> and <strong>consistency</strong> are more valuable in nearly every case. Just like with flying, we need to be able to steer and to land, not just to go fast.</p><h2><strong>Shipping machine learning projects successfully</strong></h2><p>Douglas shared many lessons in our chat with him, but these were his most important …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Over the past four quarters ending in the first quarter of 2020, Total Factor Productivity fell at a rate of -0.99% and Utilization-adjusted Total Factor Productivity grew at rate of 0.24%. Source: Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>As an engineer, I'm obsessed with productivity. My personal life is tracked in Notion lists and Evernote clips, and I've built numerous developer tools to make software development more optimized. Here in Silicon Valley, productivity is a hallowed concept embedded in the lore of engineers staying up to late hours of the night in garages working on the next big thing. But, is there any evidence that technology is actually making us more productive?</p><p>Measuring productivity is difficult task. Macroeconomists don't attempt to measure it directly, instead they measure something called <strong>total factor productivity (TFP)<em>, </em></strong>which is the residual that is not accounted for by capital accumulation or labor when calculating the growth rate of GDP output. </p><p>Macroeconomists and Silicon Valley both agree on one thing - productivity matters. One interesting discovery related to productivity is Paul Romer's endogenous growth theory, for which he won the Nobel Prize in Economics. The theory says that the most important driver of long-term economic growth is the investment and growth of ideas, which shows up in TFP. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><i>You can see the computer age everywhere but in
    the productivity statistics.</i></p><p> Robert Solow (1987) </p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>However, when looking at the data, productivity in the US and around the world shows a concerning trend. Since the 1980s, productivity growth has been falling around the world, and is even negative in many European countries. The fact that this trend lines up with the advent and mass use and distribution of the personal computer is the productivity paradox. Even in companies that invested heavily in software, productivity growth slowed down. At face value, this would suggest the counterintuitive result that software is not actually making us more productive. Why haven't these supposed productivity gains showed up in TFP?</p><h3 id="explaining-the-paradox">Explaining the Paradox</h3><p><strong>Free internet services aren't directly measured in GDP. </strong>One explanation for the paradox is the mismeasurement of inputs and outputs. Google offers Search, Android, Chrome, and Gmail for free. The welfare and leisure time we get from using these products isn't directly measured in GDP. However, when researchers tried to measure this deficit, it was estimated that the productivity shortfall was $2.7 trillion in GDP loss from 2004-2016 - did free internet services really create this large of a consumer surplus? Another macroeconomist, Syverson, found that the slowdown in productivity wasn't correlated with technology production or usage, ultimately defeating this theory.</p><p><strong>Profits are redistributed to certain firms, while technology as a whole is unproductive for the economy as a whole. </strong>This theory says that some firms are more productive with technology, while for others the investment isn't profitable. While you can find anecdotal evidence of companies purchasing SaaS products that are never fully utilized correctly, it's difficult to think that technology isn't ubiquitously productive for the majority of firms. </p><p><strong>Technology takes time to diffuse and for firms to learn and adjust before it is productive. </strong>While companies like Notion may be a household name in Silicon Valley, the technology hasn't permeated many other regions in the U.S. The field of machine learning has seen huge steps forward in model performance and utility, but the infrastructure, tools, and libraries that can make the technology productive are still coming to fruition. One of the most exciting papers on this topic is <em><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w25148">The Productivity J-Curve</a></em> by Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson. </p><figure><img src="https://matt-rickard.com/content/images/2020/07/mismeasurementcurve.png" alt=""><figcaption>Source: Brynjolfsson, Rock, Syverson, 2018. The Productivity J-Curve</figcaption></figure><p>In this paper, the authors describe technologies they call "general purpose technologies (GPT)", which we might think of as building blocks such as TCP/IP, HTTP, deep learning algorithms, and other foundational API layers. They find that early on, we underestimate the productivity gains from these technologies because of all the complementary technologies that need to be developed for the GPTs to be full utilized. From my own experience, I've seen how distributed machine learning has gone from being inaccessible to becoming a commodity. Now, its significantly easier to reproduce cutting-edge machine learning research that requires thousands of layers and massive compute simply by using open-source projects like Tensorflow and Kubeflow and cloud computing. </p><p>If Brynjolfsson is correct, should we see a significant gain in productivity growth in the future, as machine learning and other foundational technology like Kubernetes becomes more accessible? As more people outside Silicon Valley use tools like Notion and Roam Research, will we see productivity growth in non-traditional industries other than technology?</p></div><div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Safely storing digital files for a long time turns out to be an expensive and
difficult problem.</p>
<p>Recent advances in filesystems, though, have made this a doable task.</p>
<h2 id="the-old-rule-3-2-1-backups">The old rule: “3-2-1 backups”<a href="#the-old-rule-3-2-1-backups" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p>The “3-2-1” backup strategy is perhaps the most common strategy for keeping
files safe.</p>
<p>This strategy suggests that you maintain:</p>
<ul>
<li>at last <strong>three</strong> different copies of every file, with</li>
<li>at least <strong>two</strong> different <em>storage formats</em>, and</li>
<li>at least <strong>one</strong> copy offsite.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-different-storage-formats">Why different storage formats?<a href="#why-different-storage-formats" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p>If you store your data on different formats, hopefully the formats will have
different lifespans. When one fails before the other, it gives you time to make
a new copy.</p>
<p>There are several problems with this line of reasoning, though.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://photostructure.com/img/2020/06/dvd.jpg" alt="Optical media: the state of the art (last millennium)"> <figcaption>
<p>Optical media: the state of the art (last millennium)</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Storage formats available to consumers are typically only hard drives and
optical storage media (CD-R, DVD-R, or BD-R). The latest optical storage
technology is limited to 25GB per disk. Hard drives are regularly in the 1-12TB
range, which is <strong>40-500x bigger</strong>. Backing up a 6TB $100 hard drive on optical
media would be ridiculous: it would take 240 BD-R disks.</p>
<p>There’s a bigger problem with 3-2-1, though: how do you detect any problems with your files in the first place?</p>
<h2 id="why-3-2-1-isnt-enough-the-impact-of-bit-rot">Why 3-2-1 isn’t enough: the impact of “bit rot”<a href="#why-3-2-1-isnt-enough-the-impact-of-bit-rot" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p>All commonly available storage formats eventually suffer from “bit rot,” or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_degradation">data
degradation</a>.</p>
<p>Your files are comprised of hundreds of thousands or even millions of bits of data.</p>
<p>If a handful of those bits are “flipped” due to storage defects or media
degradation your file can become unreadable.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of an image with only a couple bits flipped:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://photostructure.com/img/2020/06/bitrot.jpg" alt="JPEG bitrot after flipping 0, 1, 2, or 3 bits (source)"> <figcaption>
<p>JPEG bitrot after flipping 0, 1, 2, or 3 bits (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_degradation">source</a>)</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Note that the rightmost file is 99.999% correct, yet isn’t viewable.</p>
<p>Most likely, hard drives and optical disks that are five years old or older will
have some amount of bit rot.</p>
<p>Many of our older family photos on old hard drives had succumbed to some amount
of bit rot. In discovering this unpleasantness, we updated PhotoStructure to
detect and skip over photos and videos that are corrupt, with the hope that
you’ll have several copies of a given photo, and one of them won’t have bit rot.</p>
<p>But this feature just treats the symptom: this doesn’t fix the underlying
problem.</p>
<h2 id="overcoming-bit-rot">Overcoming bit rot<a href="#overcoming-bit-rot" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p>Several advanced filesystems, including
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btrfs">Btrfs</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS">ZFS</a>, support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_scrubbing">data

Machine</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup_and_Restore">Backup and

either.</p>

<p>Satisfy the 2nd or 3rd copy of the “at least 3 copies” rule by copying the
entire contents of your NAS to an external hard drive that normally stays
powered down and offline. Do this quarterly.</p>
<p>Consider storing this drive near your emergency kit so you can grab it as you
leave your house in case of an emergency.</p>
<p>This external drive can also reduce your dataloss if your NAS catastrophically
fails, or if you get hit by malware like

<p>Satisfy the “at least 1 offsite” rule by setting up your NAS to back up to a
cloud service automatically. <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/">Backblaze</a> and
<a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/">tarsnap</a> are both well-regarded offsite storage
solutions, and both have solutions that work with your new NAS.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to pay for cloud storage, you can set up another NAS (like at
a friend or family member’s house). Both FreeNAS and Synology support NAS-to-NAS
replication.</p>

build sophisticated custom UI elements.</p>
<p>In this article, we'll give a brief overview of SVG, when to use it
(and when not to), and how to use it effectively in a React
application. We'll also briefly touch on how to integrate with d3
(which comes in very useful when working with SVG).</p>

<p>We relied heavily on SVG to build the charting updates we launched
recently in pganalyze (check out my <a href="https://pganalyze.com/blog/introducing-new-charts-and-date-picker">blog post about
these</a>
if you missed it), and we would like to share how we work with SVG in
React. At the end of the post, we link to a simple but functional
charting example based on our new charting code. We stripped it down
to make it easier to follow, and we think it's a great introduction to
building SVG components in React.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-svg"><a href="#what-is-svg" aria-label="what is svg permalink"></a>What is SVG?</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">SVG</a> is an
XML-based vector graphics format. It is commonly used for icons and
illustrations, but the similarities to HTML make it a great fit to
extend your UI. Like HTML, SVG consists of a DOM tree of elements
which can be styled with CSS, can be scripted and animated, and can
dispatch events on user interaction. SVG is well-supported in modern
browsers, including Firefox, Safari, Chrome, and Edge. All of these
support embedding SVG directly in HTML, and React supports using SVG
elements to build your components.</p>
<p>A thorough overview of SVG is beyond the scope of this post, but let's
review the salient features in the context of building UI components.
The actual elements available fall in a few different categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>simple lines and shapes, like <code>rect</code>, <code>circle</code>, and <code>line</code></li>
<li>more complex lines and shapes, like <code>polygon</code> and <code>path</code> (check out
<a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/closer-look-svg-path-data/">Joni Trythall's
post</a> on
everything you can do with the path data attribute!)</li>
<li>text, like the simple <code>text</code>, the fancy <code>textPath</code> (essentially
<code>text</code> along an arbitrary <code>path</code>), and the handy <code>title</code> (for simple
tooltips similar to HTML's <code>title</code> attribute)</li>
<li>special elements to combine and manipulate these, like <code>mask</code>,
<code>clipPath</code>, and <code>pattern</code></li>
<li>other odds and ends, like the familiar anchor (<code>a</code>) from
HTML (with the neat feature that it can conform to whatever shape it
is wrapping, and only that part is interactive).</li>
</ul>
<p>Mozilla's MDN has a good
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG">reference</a> to all
the element types available.</p>
<p>The event system is very similar to what you're already used to in
HTML. Some events are different, but many familiar ones like <code>onClick</code>,
<code>onMouseEnter</code>, <code>onFocus</code>, and <code>onKeyUp</code> are there. Registering event
handlers is the same—svg elements expose <code>onEvent</code> attributes and you
can add your callback there. If you're using TypeScript, note that
you'll need to parameterize generic React synthetic event types with
<code>SVGElement</code> or just <code>Element</code> instead of <code>HTMLElement</code>. E.g.:</p>
<div data-language="ts"><pre><code><span>const</span> handleClick <span>=</span> <span>(</span>e<span>:</span> React<span>.</span>MouseEvent<span>&lt;</span>Element<span>&gt;</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span><span>void</span></span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>'clicked'</span><span>,</span> e<span>.</span>currentTarget<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="when-to-use-svg"><a href="#when-to-use-svg" aria-label="when to use svg permalink"></a>When to use SVG</h3>
<p>If you think SVG might be a good fit for some section of your UI,
there's a good chance you're right, but you should consider your
options. There are always trade-offs. If you don't go with SVG, your
other likely options in a React app are going to be sticking with
HTML, or using Canvas. You can <a href="https://pattle.github.io/simpsons-in-css/">do a
lot</a> with some plain divs
and CSS, so HTML may be suitable for more than you think. That said,
if you feel like your use case is pushing HTML to the breaking point
(or at least into a cryptic forest of obscure tags and esoteric
styling), maybe it's not the right fit. Remember <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan">Kernighan's
Law</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in
the first place. So if you're as clever as you can be when you write it,
how will you ever debug it?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum there's Canvas. Its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_mode_(computer_graphics)">immediate
mode</a>
paradigm means it can perform much better with huge datasets, but that
also makes it awkward to work with in React, and harder to script rich
interactivity. SVG (and HTML) have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retained_mode">retained
mode</a> model that's better
suited to building UIs.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, if it's reasonable to stick with HTML, <strong>stick
with HTML</strong>. If not, and you expect to work with a <strong>modest number of
data points</strong> (the threshold will vary based on your UX needs and your
performance expectations), <strong>SVG is a good bet</strong>. It will allow you to
build these components in a manner similar to building HTML
components, and to maintain a consistent look and feel with the rest
of your app. Otherwise, consider Canvas or even WebGL.</p>
<h3 id="svg-in-react"><a href="#svg-in-react" aria-label="svg in react permalink"></a>SVG in React</h3>
<p>The mechanics of using SVG elements in React are straightforward: Just
write a standard component and return an SVG tag instead of an HTML
tag. You only need to ensure you're nesting tags correctly and only
putting SVG elements inside an <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> tag (just as you should ensure
you're not putting block-level elements in a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>). There's no
special class to extend, no extra options to handle.</p>
<p>Here is a trivial SVG component:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>Greeting</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span><span>{</span>name<span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>text</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>hello </span><span>{</span>name<span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>text</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This uses the SVG <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> element instead of the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> you might
expect in an HTML component, but as you can see, it's otherwise
identical to an HTML component. To use this, just wrap it in an
<code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> element:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>Main</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>svg</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>g</span> <span>transform</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>translate(20,20)<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
        </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Greeting</span></span> <span>name</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>Maciek<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>g</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>svg</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>(Don't worry about the <code>&lt;g&gt;</code> element for now; we'll cover that next.)</p>
<h3 id="handling-layout-in-svg"><a href="#handling-layout-in-svg" aria-label="handling layout in svg permalink"></a>Handling Layout in SVG</h3>
<p>A big difference between HTML and SVG is layout: In HTML, the normal
layout flow positions elements on the page automatically according to
a set of <del>simple</del> rules. In SVG, it's up to you to place each
individual element exactly where it's supposed to go. There is <strong>no
built-in positioning</strong> mechanism at all, and the order of the tags
really only determines what gets drawn on top of what (like z-index in
HTML; SVG has no explicit z-index.)</p>
<p>The mechanism for this positioning is a coordinate system that's
standard in computer graphics: The origin is in the upper-left corner,
and positive x and y values move elements to the right and down,
respectively. You can think of it like an HTML document where all
elements are <code>position: absolute</code>, and <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are <code>top</code> and
<code>left</code>. Here's an example:</p>
<p>
  <svg width="800" height="300" viewBox="0 0 800 300"><g transform="translate(120,120)"><rect fill="red" width="30" height="30"></rect></g><g opacity="0.4"><text text-anchor="middle" dominant-baseline="hanging" x="60" y="120">x=<!-- -->120</text><path d="M 0,120 L120,120" stroke-dasharray="4 4" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"></path><polygon points="120,120 110,115 113,120 110,125" fill="black"></polygon></g><g opacity="0.4"><text text-anchor="start" dominant-baseline="middle" x="120" y="60">&nbsp;y=<!-- -->120</text><path d="M 120,0 L120,120" stroke-dasharray="4 4" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"></path><polygon transform="rotate(90 120,120)" points="120,120 110,115 113,120 110,125" fill="black"></polygon></g><g transform="translate(300,160)"><circle fill="powderblue" r="20"></circle></g><g opacity="0.4"><text text-anchor="middle" dominant-baseline="hanging" x="150" y="160">x=<!-- -->300</text><path d="M 0,160 L300,160" stroke-dasharray="4 4" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"></path><polygon points="300,160 290,155 293,160 290,165" fill="black"></polygon></g><g opacity="0.4"><text text-anchor="start" dominant-baseline="middle" x="300" y="80">&nbsp;y=<!-- -->160</text><path d="M 300,0 L300,160" stroke-dasharray="4 4" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"></path><polygon transform="rotate(90 300,160)" points="300,160 290,155 293,160 290,165" fill="black"></polygon></g><g transform="translate(520,200)"><text fill="green">some text</text></g><g opacity="0.4"><text text-anchor="middle" dominant-baseline="hanging" x="260" y="200">x=<!-- -->520</text><path d="M 0,200 L520,200" stroke-dasharray="4 4" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"></path><polygon points="520,200 510,195 513,200 510,205" fill="black"></polygon></g><g opacity="0.4"><text text-anchor="start" dominant-baseline="middle" x="520" y="100">&nbsp;y=<!-- -->200</text><path d="M 520,0 L520,200" stroke-dasharray="4 4" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"></path><polygon transform="rotate(90 520,200)" points="520,200 510,195 513,200 510,205" fill="black"></polygon></g></svg></p>
<p>As you can see, the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> offsets mean slightly different things
for different types of elements. For <code>rect</code>, it's the upper-left
corner. For <code>circle</code> and <code>ellipse</code>, it's the center (in fact, circles
and ellipses use <code>cx</code> and <code>cy</code> attributes instead of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> to
make this clearer). For text, it's a reference point, and the text's
placement relative to that point is configurable via attributes like
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/dominant-baseline">dominant-baseline</a>
and
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/text-anchor">text-anchor</a>
(by default, the text starts at the x position, with the baseline at
the y position.)</p>
<p>At first blush, this seems like it would make any non-trivial SVG
component a nightmare to put together, but we can use some SVG
features and some conventions to help us build complex modular
components that work well together.</p>
<p>Let's assume we're working with a certain explicit <code>width</code> and
<code>height</code> for our component. This can get tricky if you need your
component to be responsive, but we'll hand-wave around it for now; we
discuss that in more detail below.</p>
<p>In general, we've found a good approach for SVG components is to have
parents size and position their children by subdividing the parent's
own width and height. Parents determine each child's desired <code>width</code>
and <code>height</code> and pass those as props. We could also pass <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
to have children position themselves, but SVG provides a handy element
that simplifies this: the group (<code>&lt;g&gt;</code>). As its name suggests, the
element is a way to apply a set of properties to a group of children.
Most relevant for us is the <code>transform</code> attribute, specifically its
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/transform#Translate"><code>translate</code></a>
value. This lets us establish a new origin local to the group, offset
from the parent origin (which may be another <code>&lt;g&gt;</code>!) by the specified
x and y values. This is perfect for positioning children, since you
can easily do so in the parent. The children themselves can pretend
they're positioned at the origin, so they only have to worry about
their width and height, and what to render within that space. In fact,
this pattern is so useful, we have a helper component to do this:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>Translate</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span><span>{</span>x<span>=</span><span>0</span><span>,</span>y<span>=</span><span>0</span><span>,</span>children<span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span>x <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>!</span>y<span>)</span> <span>return</span> children<span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>g</span> <span>transform</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span><span>`</span><span>translate(</span><span><span>${</span>x<span>}</span></span><span>,</span><span><span>${</span>y<span>}</span></span><span>)</span><span>`</span></span><span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>{</span>children<span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>g</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Even though subdividing space like this in SVG component hierarchies
is a good rule of thumb, sometimes it may not be a good fit for some
part of your UI. Since <code>&lt;g&gt;</code> is <strong>not</strong> a bounded container like a
sized <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with <code>overflow: hidden</code>, the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>
pattern is just metadata for children to follow as a guideline. If
that pattern gets in the way, you can break the rules and have
children draw outside these bounds (though the result may be harder to
reason about).</p>
<p>Another useful pattern is to have components specify all the sizing
and positioning metadata in constants at the top of the component:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>Chart</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span><span>{</span> data <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<p>Design is about constantly closing the gap between what users expect from your product and what it actually does. Product teams try to close this chasm every day, whether by user testing, tracking metrics and behavior, or seeking feedback. In attempts to bridge this user experience communication gap, teams often forget the most important thing — the text.</p>



<p>Product copy, or the text found on user interfaces, is the most under-leveraged part of product development today. Here are a few reasons why.</p>

<p>Unlike almost anything else in product development, editing copy doesn’t require any engineering or design lift. Working on copy is about <em>maximizing the utility of your existing feature set</em>.</p>



<p>In many cases, the cheapest and most practical solution to a problem is well-written copy. Rather than committing a team’s time to building an entirely new feature, editing the copy goes a long way in user retention and engagement.</p>



<p>Whether it’s a clearer error state that helps users self-correct or an empty state that helps users get started, editing text can directly affect metrics. [1] It’s easy for the conversation around copy to revolve around marketing copy (thinking about text on a landing page or a marketing email and whether or not it converts), but this conversation around the importance of text needs to shift to product as well.</p>



<p>Of course, there’s no substitute for poor design, but bad copy can make even the best designs ineffective.</p>



<h5>Product copy is your most direct line of communication to users</h5>



<p>As John Maeda expressed with his <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://vimeo.com/208035080" target="_blank">2017 Design in Tech report</a>, “Words are really important because the graphics don’t make sense sometimes.”</p>



<p>Product copy makes expected user behavior <em>explicit</em>. It’s your chance to communicate intent. In being what your users actually read, the text anchors the user experience and bridges gaps in expectation. As UX writer Ryan Cordell&nbsp;points out:</p>



<div><p>“Microcopy is how your product communicates. It provides answers, feedback, comfort, guidance, encouragement and more. If we fail to design the words we use, this still communicates something to the user. It says we can’t or don’t want to help. It says we don’t care as much as we should. And that’s catastrophic for the customer experience.” [2]</p></div>



<p>Ultimately in building a product, you’re optimizing for user understanding — to surface the value of the features that your team spent so long to build.</p>



<h5>Text is what guides users when they venture off the happy path</h5>



<p>It’s often easy for designers and PM’s to optimize for the happy path: the user experience that most closely aligns with their own expectations of how the product should be used. However, we all know that expectations often exist in isolation from how people actually use your product — and much of the burden of steering users back on track <em>relies on the text</em>.</p>



<p>Copy serves as your product’s guardrails. Whether it’s an error message, a new user experience, or an empty state, it’s often <em>text</em> that guides users when they don’t know what to expect. In a study conducted by Microsoft Azure’s design team, user test errors<em> decreased by 44%</em> after copy changes alone. [3]</p>



<p>It’s in these moments of mismatched expectations that clarity is most critical. This is especially true as the role of software expands. From health-tech to purchasing houses and cars, the sole responsibility of guiding people through complex and important decisions is now carried by the digital experience.</p>



<p>Often times, however, because these non-ideal users journeys don’t get designed, users are greeted with generic text written ad-hoc by the last person that touches it.</p>



<h5>Copy exists from end to end</h5>



<p>Almost every single step of the product development process works in verticals — designers work in design tools and then pass designs off to developers that work in devtools. The same verticalization of tooling and work applies to almost every other step of building a software product with a team.</p>



<p>The <em>exception</em> to this verticalization of product development is the copy, which exists from the very beginning (specs, drafts) all the way to the very end (in the final product) and is touched by everyone from design to engineering to legal to marketing.</p>



<p>Rather than existing as one-offs, the product text works in a system to build trust for users. Like the narrator in a story, copy sets the context and defines the goals. [4] Thinking about copy early means being intentional about the information you convey to users — and drives design decisions like progressive disclosure and information architecture.</p>



<hr>



<p>Let’s be clear: writing good copy is <em>hard</em>. It might not be glanceably flashy the same way a Dribbble post might be. Text often “looks” the same in a design at first- and second-pass, even after edits. Reworking copy can be painstaking — and requires an in-depth understanding of both the product and the user.</p>



<p>But as we want to build and design products that shape how people interact with the world, we shouldn’t overlook the obvious when communicating: the words.</p>



<hr>



















<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p>



<div><div>
<div><p>[0] In full disclosure, our belief that text should be first-class in building product has led Jolena and I to building <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://dittowords.com/" target="_blank">Ditto</a>. 🤗</p></div>
</div></div>



<p>[1] Even really simple copy changes change produce enormous ROI. <a href="https://www.directyourbookings.com/blog/marketing/convert-better-with-ux-writing-hotel-case-study-by-google/">One example</a> of many is the 17% increase in engagement when Google Travel replaced “Book a Room” with “Check Availability”.</p>



<p>[2] You can find more great excerpts from Ryan’s post on communication theory and microcopy <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/3-communication-theories-that-will-help-you-write-better-microcopy-and-make-better-products-4df25571ca6f">here</a>.</p>



<p>[3] In addition to decreased user test errors, the metrics-driven insights found by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyliehansen">Kylie Hansen</a>‘s team impacted NPS, customer retention, active users, and more. She goes over some of it <a href="https://ellessmedia.com/csi/kylie-hansen/">here</a>.</p>



<p>[4a] A scenario that often requires high trust is a monetary transaction. Increasing transparency by clearly surfacing what to expect is something that <a href="https://uxplanet.org/this-is-ux-writing-at-its-very-best-2806f3f386e0">both Airbnb and Amazon do well</a>.</p>

					<p><em><span>Project Post</span></em></p>
<p><span>Today, the CNCF Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) voted to accept Contour as an incubation-level hosted project.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://projectcontour.io/"><span>Contour</span></a><span> is a high-performance ingress controller for Kubernetes that provides a control plane for </span><a href="https://envoyproxy.io/"><span>Envoy</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>“One of the most important steps for running workloads at scale with Kubernetes is to implement efficient Layer 7 traffic ingress management,” said Matt Klein, software engineer at Lyft and TOC sponsor for Contour. “Contour fills a common operational gap by providing a way for users to access applications within a Kubernetes cluster. As Contour is already integrated with Envoy, it is a natural fit for CNCF, and we look forward to helping the project build its community.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Contour works by deploying Envoy as a reverse proxy and load balancer. Contour supports dynamic configuration updates and multi-team Kubernetes clusters with the ability to limit the Namespaces that may configure virtual hosts and TLS credentials as well as provide advanced load balancing strategies.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“We believe CNCF can play a big role in shaping the future of ingress controllers, a critical part of any cloud native infrastructure,” said Michael Michael, Contour maintainer, and director of product management at VMware. “We are excited to have a vendor neutral home, encouraging more companies and contributors to join our community, contribute, and help us deliver on the vision of Contour.”</span></p>
<p><span>Contour has been adopted by a number of well-known organizations and enterprises in production, including Adobe, Kinvolk, Kintone, PhishLabs, and Replicated. Adobe has</span><a href="https://youtu.be/39FLsSc2P-Y?t=83"><span> adopted Contour</span></a><span> as its ingress controller for “Project Ethos”, a multi-tenant Kubernetes based platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Main Contour Features:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Envoy Inside: Contour is built as the control plane for Envoy, the high performance L7 proxy and load balancer</span></li>
<li><span>Flexible Architecture: Contour can be deployed as either a Kubernetes deployment or daemonset</span></li>
<li><span>Multi-team support: Safely support ingress in multi-team Kubernetes clusters</span></li>
<li><span>TLS Certificate Delegation: Administrators can delegate wildcard certificate access more securely</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Notable Milestones:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>329 Contributors&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>91 Committers</span></li>
<li><span>2.3k GitHub Stars</span></li>
<li><span>375 Forks</span></li>
<li><span>48 Releases</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>“Modern distributed systems rely on networking and connectivity, making ingress controllers for Kubernetes an essential piece of architecture,” said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. “Contour is a logical complement to Envoy and makes it easier to consume in a cloud native, multi-team environment. As Envoy is an incredibly popular graduated project, we look forward to seeing what Contour will accomplish as part of CNCF.”</span></p>
<p><span>Contour has an active </span><a href="https://github.com/projectcontour/community/blob/master/ROADMAP.md"><span>roadmap</span></a><span> and plans to add support for </span><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/service-apis"><span>Kubernetes Service APIs</span></a><span> and for routing services across Kubernetes clusters. The team also plans to enable support for Envoy features like rate limiting, auth, and access log service.</span></p>
<p><span>In 2017 Contour was created at Heptio, which was then acquired by VMware in 2018. The team released v1.0 in November 2019.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As a CNCF hosted project, joining incubating technologies like OpenTracing, gRPC, CNI, Notary, NATS, Linkerd, Rook, etcd, OPA, CRI-O, TiKV, CloudEvents, Falco, Argo, Dragonfly, and SPIFFE and SPIRE, Contour is part of a neutral foundation aligned with its technical interests, as well as the larger Linux Foundation, which provides governance, marketing support, and community outreach.</span></p>
<p><span>Every CNCF project has an associated maturity level: sandbox, incubating, or graduated. For more information on maturity requirements for each level, please visit the </span><a href="https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/process/graduation_criteria.adoc"><span>CNCF Graduation Criteria</span></a><span>.</span></p>

You can see more web demos <a href="https://picovoice.ai/demos/">here</a>.</p><h2 id="how-to-embed-voice-ai-in-the-browser">How to embed Voice AI in the browser</h2><p>To achieve offline voice AI, we can use speech technology from Picovoice. Picovoice engines run in modern web browsers via WebAssembly. A typical use case involves providing the engines realtime audio input from the microphone, and receiving events back (e.g. hotword detected).</p><p>The core of running any Picovoice engine in the browser is simply three files: a WebAssembly module, its wrapper, and a binding file. The binding provides a factory method for creating an instance of the engine. The engine fires a callback to signal that the WASM has finished loading, accepts frames of audio, and returns the engine results.</p><p>We will expand on this foundation with additional steps to setup streaming audio, request microphone permission, and downsample audio to the required format. We’ve provided demo code to assist with those tasks.</p><h3 id="web-audio-api-and-microphone-access">Web Audio API and Microphone access</h3><p>Picovoice uses the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API">Web Audio API</a> to process streaming audio. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices">MediaDevices API</a> is used to access the microphone. The user must explicitly grant permission to access the microphone before any audio processing can occur. This is mandatory due to browsers’ security model. Additionally, the browser requires an HTTPS connection to allow microphone access (for testing locally, HTTP will suffice).</p><h3 id="web-voice-processor">Web Voice Processor</h3><p>Picovoice engines accept industry standard 16KHz audio for speech processing. When accessing microphone audio, we need to downsample it to this format. We also need to ask for permission from the user to access their microphone, and connect the input to the downsampler. To handle these tasks we have provided the <a href="https://github.com/Picovoice/web-voice-processor">Web Voice Processor</a> package. It is also available on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@picovoice/web-voice-processor">npm</a>.</p><h3 id="web-workers">Web Workers</h3><p>Picovoice recommends using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API">Web Workers</a> to run the engines in the background. Workers separate the speech processing from the main JavaScript thread.</p><p><img src="https://picovoice.ai/static/callbacks-c8a5873581c231ecd10793ca212b2f8d.svg" alt="Callbacks and Workers"></p><p>The demo code includes Porcupine and Rhino web worker scripts. They communicate with managers in the main thread using <code>postMessage()</code>. In addition, the Web Voice Processor performs downsampling via its own dedicated worker.</p><h3 id="open-source-demo-applications">Open Source Demo Applications</h3><p>We have provided demo code for the Porcupine and Rhino engines (including running both together) that will run in a recent web browser without transpilation required.</p><p>The Porcupine demo allows you to control a smart lamp with always-listening commands.</p><p>The Smart Lighting demo uses Rhino to handle smart home lighting with natural language commands like “dim the living room lights”.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Desmos-Art-Guide.jpg" alt="Math Vault — The Definitive Desmos Art Guide to Computational Sketching" width="800" height="480" title="Desmos Art Guide" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20480'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Desmos-Art-Guide.jpg"></p><p>If you’re of the type who enjoys playing around with graphing calculator, then you might be interested in the so-called <strong>Desmos Art</strong>. These are basically&nbsp;<em>pictures</em> and <em>animations</em>&nbsp;created in <a href="https://www.desmos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Desmos</a>&nbsp;primarily through the clever use of <em>equations</em> and <em>inequalities</em> — among other features such as <em>tables</em>, <em>animating sliders</em> and <em>regression&nbsp;models</em>.&nbsp;Indeed, if you go to <a href="https://www.desmos.com/art" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this official staff pick page</a>, you&nbsp;should&nbsp;see that a whole bunch of creative artworks were already being created — anything from&nbsp;<em>cartoon characters</em>,&nbsp;<em>landscape</em>&nbsp;to <em>logos</em> and <em>portraits</em>.</p><p>But here’s&nbsp;a&nbsp;problem: when you reach a Desmos artwork page, you&nbsp;get to see the end-result with all the <em>equations</em> and <em>inequalities</em>, without necessarily having any clue about how the sketching process comes about from the beginning to the end:</p><ul><li>Why does this weird-looking equation pop out from <em>nowhere</em>?</li><li>How did the author know that $3.982$ is the <em>leading coefficient</em> to use?</li><li>And how did those numbers get so precise up to <em>four</em>&nbsp;decimals digits?</li></ul><p>To remedy this situation, we came up with a laborious and&nbsp;interesting solution: we decided to go out there and create a new Desmos sketch from scratch, and work backward to comment a bit on&nbsp;the <em>steps</em>, <em>procedures</em> and <em>reasoning</em> involved&nbsp;in the sketching process —&nbsp;as we go through the different&nbsp;stages and portions&nbsp;of the drawing.</p><p>And with that, let’s proceed straight into our Desmos Art guide in <strong>computational sketching</strong>, which — as you might have guessed — is going to be both fun and informative — even if you have no intention whatsoever of using any graphing calculator in the near future. <span id="more-7609"></span></p><h2 id="s1"><span id="Step_1_Initial_Setup_%E2%80%94_Source_Picture"></span><a href="#toc">Step 1: Initial Setup — Source&nbsp;Picture</a><span></span></h2><p>Unless you are some kind of sketching guru — which we certainly are not — it’s generally better to&nbsp;base the&nbsp;sketching on some underlying model: some picture that you actually want to draw; some picture that&nbsp;you can rely upon in case the&nbsp;sketching derails&nbsp;by a huge&nbsp;margin.</p><p>And in case it’s&nbsp;not clear enough, you should only choose a picture that you really, <em>really</em> enjoy sketching&nbsp;— something that you can derive a&nbsp;whole lot of&nbsp;satisfaction from. This is because unlike ordinary <em>pencil-and-eraser sketching</em>, sketching in Desmos has to be done by&nbsp;filling the command lines with <strong>equations</strong>, <strong>tables</strong> and <strong>inequalities</strong>, so that&nbsp;if you can’t fuel enough passion into a drawing, then the time and effort invested into reproducing it&nbsp;is&nbsp;probably not going to worth it.</p><p>Also, when choosing a picture, take good care to select one that is <em>not</em> too difficult to draw. Otherwise, you might have to regret your decision much later when you’re already, say, 21 hours into the process. Of course, you&nbsp;don’t want to make the picture too easy either, as it might not be much of a gratifying experience if you&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;that&nbsp;way.</p><p>In our case, using the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/gold/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit Gold</a>&nbsp;membership recently awarded to us, we went out there and created&nbsp;our first very own&nbsp;signature <em>Reddit alien avatar</em>:</p><div id="attachment_8064"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8064" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Vault-Redditbot.png" alt="Math Vault Snoovtar — Redditlady and Redditdog" width="520" height="520" title="Math Vault Redditbot" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20520%20520'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Vault-Redditbot.png"></p><p id="caption-attachment-8064">Guess who’s in the house? The <strong>Math Vault Snoovtar</strong>! (<em>alien avatar</em> in Redditese)</p></div><p>For the lack of better terms, let’s just call these lovely creatures <em>Math Vault Redditlady</em> and <em>Redditdog</em>, respectively. Now,&nbsp;does this logo make a good choice as a <em>source image</em>? We certainly think it does:</p><ul><li><strong>Passion Level</strong>: Since we only create avatars that we like, channeling energy into recreating the creatures invented in part by ourselves is definitely not an issue.</li><li><strong>Complexity</strong>: Both the Redditlady and the Redditdog have very&nbsp;<em>well-defined </em>borders and colors,&nbsp;making it a formidable&nbsp;challenge that’s not&nbsp;too intimidating.</li></ul><p>And with both criteria passed, we proceed to happily import&nbsp;our avatar image into Desmos. By default, Desmos likes to set the <strong>origin</strong> $(0,0)$ as the <em>center</em> of the image, and that is a good choice for most purposes. However, depending on the size of the&nbsp;source image, sometimes it makes sense to consider rescaling it so that <em>at the default zoom level</em>, the image occupies around 70% of the <strong>graphing grid</strong>&nbsp;either in height or in width. If the image is too small, then it’s hard to appreciate any&nbsp;fine detail, and if it’s too big, then one&nbsp;might&nbsp;have a hard time focusing on the big picture — literally.</p><p>In our case, since the&nbsp;avatar is&nbsp;just about the right size to start with, we decided to keep the <strong>dimension</strong> of the image to the default $10 \times 10$ setting at the end. We also didn’t alter&nbsp;the image’s&nbsp;<strong>aspect ratio</strong>&nbsp;either, which in many cases aren’t really&nbsp;necessary anyway.</p><p>But just to drive the message home a bit, setting up a&nbsp;source image correctly from the get-go is more important than it seems, since the last thing we&nbsp;want to be doing is to, say,&nbsp;<em>rescale</em> the image to an appropriate size after being&nbsp;already halfway through the sketching process.</p><h2 id="s2"><span id="Step_2_Divide_and_Conquer"></span><a href="#toc">Step 2: Divide and Conquer</a><span></span></h2><p>How do you deal with a huge task that seems impossible to complete? You partition the task into smaller subtasks. That is, tasks that are so small that you actually enjoy doing them!</p><p>In particular, when it comes to sketching in Desmos, you want&nbsp;to section the picture into different <strong>portions</strong>, each of which can be&nbsp;finished in a reasonable amount of time, so&nbsp;that when it comes to the time of&nbsp;sketching, you focus on one&nbsp;single portion and one&nbsp;single&nbsp;portion only.</p><p>In our case, since we know that sketching the entire Redditlady and its companion pet can be quite a challenge, instead of resorting to despair, we divide the entire avatar into 6 portions — from the top to the bottom:</p><div><div><ul><li>Hand &amp; Rubik’s Cube</li><li>Skirt</li><li>Redditdog</li></ul></div></div><div><figure><img src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Desmos-Folders.jpg" alt="Sketching in Desmos: Using Folder to Organize Command Lines" width="470" height="574" title="Desmos Folders" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20470%20574'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Desmos-Folders.jpg"><figcaption>Math Vault Redditbots&nbsp;cut into 6 pieces. Neat!</figcaption></figure></div><p> By inspection, while we see that most of these portions are&nbsp;relatively simple&nbsp;to implement, we still anticipate some challenges ahead of us when it comes to the&nbsp;Armor portion. In an attempt to make the Armor less intimidating, we proceed to&nbsp;subdivide it&nbsp;further into 7&nbsp;<strong>subportions</strong>:</p><div><div><ul><li>Left Shoulder</li><li>Right Shoulder</li><li>Collar</li><li>Arm</li></ul></div><div><ul><li>Chest</li><li>“Lungs”</li><li>“Outer Lungs”</li></ul></div></div><p>With the gist of our&nbsp;organisational structure now settled, we then proceed to create a&nbsp;<strong>Desmos folder</strong>&nbsp;for each of the general portions, all of the while making a mental note that every command line pertaining to a specific&nbsp;portion should&nbsp;be <em>dragged</em> into its&nbsp;associated folder — if it’s not already in there.</p><p>And while Desmos doesn’t really support <em>folder nesting</em> at this point, there’s nothing preventing us from using&nbsp;<strong>comment lines</strong> to provide labels for the subportions. True, while this level of organization could&nbsp;be an <em>overkill</em> for a simple picture, as the complexity&nbsp;of the&nbsp;picture increases, structuring the command lines this way can make&nbsp;<em>line identification</em> and <em>future reference </em>substantially easier.</p><div><figure><img src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Armor-Subportions.gif" alt="Sketching in Desmos: Using Comment To Label Subportions of the Image" width="414" height="387" title="Armor Subportions" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20414%20387'%3E%3C/svg%3E"><figcaption> A list of command lines under the Armor folder. Note the use of comments to label the Armor subportions.</figcaption></figure></div><p> In our case for example, the need for quick reference became so urgent that towards&nbsp;the end of the sketching, we ended up creating far more subportions than we originally thought needed. Here’s our updated organisational structure at the completion of the&nbsp;avatar:</p><div><div><ul><li><strong>Antenna &amp; Hat</strong></li><li><strong>Face</strong><ul><li>Eyes</li><li>Borders</li></ul></li><li><strong>Armor</strong><ul><li>Shoulders</li><li>Collar &amp; Arms</li><li>Chest</li></ul><ul><li>“Lungs” &amp;”Outer Lungs”</li></ul></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><strong>Hands &amp; Rubik’s Cube</strong><ul><li>Hand</li><li>Right Side</li><li>Left Side</li><li>Top</li></ul></li><li><strong>Skirt &amp; Legs</strong><ul><li>Coloring</li><li>Gap</li><li>Borders</li><li>Legs</li></ul></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><strong>Redditdog</strong><ul><li>Face</li><li>Ears</li><li>Lower Body</li><li>Body Gaps</li><li>Leg Gaps</li><li>Left Eye</li><li>Right Eye</li><li>Nose</li><li>Tail</li></ul></li></ul></div></div><p>(Yep. The Redditdog proved to be a bit more annoying than originally anticipated. Hence the saying “Don’t judge a puppy by its cover.”)</p><p><span> Learn to sketch a puppy computationally in Desmos through equations and inequalities! </span> <span><span>Click to Tweet</span><i></i></span></p><h2 id="s3"><span id="Step_3_Portion_Crunching"></span><a href="#toc">Step 3: Portion Crunching</a><span></span></h2><p>As mentioned a bit earlier, when working on a sketch, it’s often less intimidating to&nbsp;just focus on a portion while ignoring the rest. We call this <strong>portion crunching</strong>, and&nbsp;is done in part to ensure that the work completed&nbsp;with minimal resistance&nbsp;and mental blocks. In Desmos, portion crunching&nbsp;usually boils down to&nbsp;the&nbsp;following two parts: <strong>curving drawing</strong> and <strong>region coloring</strong>.</p><h3 id="s3a"><span id="Step_3a_Drawing_Curves"></span><a href="#toc">Step 3a: Drawing Curves</a><span></span></h3><p>In general, a self-contained portion of an image is composed of <strong>close figures</strong>, which in turn can be construed as&nbsp;&nbsp;a series of <strong>curve segments</strong>. However, since these curve&nbsp;segments&nbsp;tend&nbsp;interact with each other, it would be hard for us to draw these segments <em>sequentially</em>&nbsp;— as would be done in ordinary pencil-and-eraser sketching.&nbsp;<span>Instead, we prefer to resort to the strategy&nbsp;as outlined below:</span></p><blockquote><ol><li>Model a curve segment using an appropriate class of <strong>equations</strong>, and leave its&nbsp;graph&nbsp;with the&nbsp;full domain <em>intact</em>.</li><li>Do the modeling for <em>each</em>&nbsp;of the curve segments in the close figure.</li><li>Cut off the excessive parts of&nbsp;each curve — by imposing <strong>restrictions</strong> on the&nbsp;associated equation.</li></ol></blockquote><p>In particular, we&nbsp;want the curve trimming to&nbsp;happen at the very end, because&nbsp;once the curve modeling are done for each curve segment in&nbsp;a close figure, Desmos will map out all&nbsp;the <strong>intersection points</strong>&nbsp;along with&nbsp;their coordinates — the latter of which provide key information as to where&nbsp;to cut off the&nbsp;curves, and might not be available had&nbsp;we&nbsp;decided to trim the curves off from the get-go.</p><p>In actuality though, we’ll&nbsp;probably spend more time modeling the curve segments rather than trimming&nbsp;them&nbsp;— as there are&nbsp;simply too many&nbsp;curves&nbsp;in too many&nbsp;different shapes and forms. And while it might be hard&nbsp;to provide an exhaustive set of tips for modeling each curve segment we will ever encounter, the following procedures&nbsp;should be more than enough to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;most of them.</p><h4 id="line"><span id="Modeling_Line_Segments"></span><a href="#toc">Modeling Line Segments</a><span></span></h4><p>Many close figures are composed of nothing but lines, and <strong>vertical/</strong><strong>horizontal line segments</strong> are about as easy as one&nbsp;can get. For example, to create the line segment connecting $(1.2, 5)$ with&nbsp;$(1.2, 5.67)$, simply typing $x=1.2 \, \{5\le y \le 5.67 \}$ into a command line will do just fine.</p><p>In general, if you know the coordinates of the two <strong>endpoints</strong> of a line segment, then you can enter them into a <em>Desmos table</em>, and re-configure the points (via the <em>Gear Icon</em>) to have a line segment passing through it.</p><p>On the other hand, if you only have the coordinate of a single point on the line segment, say $(2.33,4.67)$, then you can still resort to&nbsp;the <strong>point-slope form</strong>, which in this case becomes $y=(x-2.33)+4.67$. In fact, by simply adjusting the <em>slope</em>&nbsp;one digit at a time, and observing the graph at an ever-increasing …</p></div></div>

<p>If you are bootstrapping like us and you can’t burn money on CPC campaigns, you need to find out clever ways to acquire new customers.</p>



<p>For us, it’s even worst because we are in a very crowded market and the live chat keyword has an incredible high bid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have tried several times to purchase live chat keywords on google and other PPC programs like <a href="https://www.capterra.com/p/173977/Customerly/reviews/">Capterra</a>.</p>



<p>We never had a satisfying result from them.</p>



<p>They are very expensive in a range of 20$ per click on google and starting at 2$ per click on Capterra.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The truth is we have never had a campaign with a proper return of the investment.</p>



<p>We decided then to focus on channels that always worked for us:</p>



<ul><li>Referrals</li><li>Partnerships</li><li>Integrations</li></ul>



<p>We have grown from 0 to 6000 signups for free thanks to the “powered by” label you can find in our live chat of the basic plan accounts.</p>



<h2>The WordPress Live Chat plugin Integration</h2>



<p>When we decided to help our WordPress customers with an easier integration of the live chat within their WordPress website we never thought it was such an incredible opportunity of growth.</p>



<p>The Live Chat WordPress plugin was quite easy to develop, it’s just a wrapper of the JavaScript code with some tweaks to fetch user’s data automatically for our customers.</p>



<p>People were searching for a quick live chat to use on their websites and we have a solution for them.</p>



<p>The plugin itself took 10 hours of coding. It was very basic and was doing its job quite well in terms of functionalities.</p>



<p>When you installed the first version of the live chat plugin of Customerly you could do an onboarding that redirects you to the Customerly dashboard to complete the customization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once you had complete the submission on Customerly you needed to grab the project id and paste it in a small input textbox, save and then the live chat was appearing on your website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Magic right?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nope.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It took a while to understand how to optimize the onboarding experience, but before talking about this, let me start on how we have optimized the SEO within the WordPress’ plugin directory.</p>



<p>Follow me from here because I’m going to share with you the exact optimization strategies that I’ve learned by bringing our live chat WordPress plugin from the 33 positions for the<strong>&nbsp;live chat</strong>&nbsp;keyword to the 4 positions. Ranking above HubSpot.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/How_we_have_got_13k_B2B_Signups_for_Free_by_using_WordPress_directory_with_our_Live_Chat_plugin.jpg?fit=897%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" alt="WordPress directory with our Live Chat plugin" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/How_we_have_got_13k_B2B_Signups_for_Free_by_using_WordPress_directory_with_our_Live_Chat_plugin.jpg?w=1276&amp;ssl=1 1276w, https://i1.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/How_we_have_got_13k_B2B_Signups_for_Free_by_using_WordPress_directory_with_our_Live_Chat_plugin.jpg?resize=263%2C300&amp;ssl=1 263w, https://i1.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/How_we_have_got_13k_B2B_Signups_for_Free_by_using_WordPress_directory_with_our_Live_Chat_plugin.jpg?resize=897%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 897w, https://i1.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/How_we_have_got_13k_B2B_Signups_for_Free_by_using_WordPress_directory_with_our_Live_Chat_plugin.jpg?resize=768%2C876&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></figure>



<h2>Choose the right Keywords</h2>



<p>For us it is quite easy, the keyword to focus on are three:</p>



<ul><li>Live Chat</li><li>Free Live Chat</li><li>Live Chat Free</li></ul>



<p>Think about in terms of anything related to your product that can be interesting for someone searching on the directory.</p>



<p>For example, we do offer a <a href="https://www.customerly.io/en/email-marketing-newsletter-template-builder?utm_campaign=wpoptim&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=Customerly">newsletter</a> and <a href="https://www.customerly.io/en/visual-marketing-sales-funnel-automation?utm_campaign=wpoptim&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=Customerly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">funnel</a> service at a smaller cost than MailChimp and it can be integrated easily with MailMunch and Elementor forms.</p>



<p>We decided to use these keywords in the FAQ to let people find the plugin since they are related to what we do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I strongly suggest you focus on one single keyword for the title and the presentation though.</p>



<p>People need a <a href="https://www.customerly.io/en/live-chat-software-for-customer-support?utm_campaign=WPplugin&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=Customerly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Live Chat for their website</a>, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Where do you go to search for a WordPress plugin?</p>



<p>Google or WordPress directory.</p>



<p>The WordPress directory itself has enormous traffic you can turn into your customer acquisition flow for free.</p>



<p>We cannot know exactly the amount of searches for each keyword on the WordPress plugin directory but we have two ways to understand to which one has more traffic:</p>



<ul><li>The google keyword planner is a good start to understand volumes.</li><li>Check the first 3 plugins that are listed for a specific keyword and analyze their daily downloads.</li></ul>



<p>You can check ANY WordPress plugin performance by adding /advanced/ at the end of the URL like this: https://wordpress.org/plugins/customerly/advanced/</p>



<p>Sum their daily downloads and you will get a sense of the traffic you can get from that keyword.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>The Plugin Readme</strong></h2>



<p>When we released the first version I didn’t know the readme was the most important part of the game and was the last thing I’ve focused on.</p>



<p>In fact, that single file alone is the reason why today we have got 13k B2B signups for free.</p>



<p><em>That one plus a few other tricks.</em></p>



<p>I thought it was just a description of the plugin without any importance for ranking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I’ve written a small description on how to install the plugin and link the chat to the website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Very nerdy and not attractive at all.</p>



<p>I started wondering if there was a way to rank on the top 10 and this is my journey to it.</p>



<p>There are very few articles online on how to optimize your WordPress plugin to rank on the directory and no SaaS to keep track of your SEO improvements while optimizing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, with my curiosity, I started to AB testing almost everything I could.</p>



<p>And it worked.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>The WordPress Directory Competitor Analysis&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>First of all, I started by analyzing the competitors for the live chat keyword.</p>



<p>I’ve found out a weird behaviour of the ranking algorithm: a bunch of live chat plugins with very few active installs were ranking higher than others with hundreds of thousands of installs.</p>



<p>As you can see from the screenshot above when we ranked above HubSpot we had just 500+ active installs versus 80,000+ active installs of HubSpot.</p>



<p>That’s when I started thinking, we can rank in the top 10 too even if we have just released with very few active installs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But how?</p>



<p>So I started with optimizing the readme in 3 ways:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Adding Keywords in the Title</li><li>Adding Keywords in the small description&nbsp;</li><li>A lot of keywords in the long descriptions</li></ul>



<p>Below you can see how many times we added the keyword live chat in the Readme when we have updated it.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wordpress_Plugin_directory_optimization_for_Live_Chat.jpg?fit=1024%2C789&amp;ssl=1" alt="WordPress Live Chat plugin Readme" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wordpress_Plugin_directory_optimization_for_Live_Chat.jpg?w=1542&amp;ssl=1 1542w, https://i1.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wordpress_Plugin_directory_optimization_for_Live_Chat.jpg?resize=300%2C231&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wordpress_Plugin_directory_optimization_for_Live_Chat.jpg?resize=1024%2C789&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wordpress_Plugin_directory_optimization_for_Live_Chat.jpg?resize=768%2C592&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wordpress_Plugin_directory_optimization_for_Live_Chat.jpg?resize=1536%2C1183&amp;ssl=1 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></figure>



<p>I noticed 2 minutes after the submission of the new readme version we ranked 20 positions higher.</p>



<p>The difference between Google and WordPress ranking is that WordPress is immediately updated.</p>



<p>So you can immediately know if you have done something wrong or good.</p>



<p>I started A/B testing and it worked quite well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We were on the first page (top 20 results) and I knew I could do something else to optimize.</p>



<p>We decided to extend the optimization to the FAQ.</p>



<p>So I started adding keywords to the question and within the answer.</p>



<p>It worked great as well! A few minutes later we were ranking in the top 9 positions for the live chat keyword.</p>



<p>Bam!</p>



<p>The day after we saw a spike of installs but the signups were still very few.</p>



<h2><strong>The importance of active install growth&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>At the time, to install the live chat you needed to follow a link to the Customerly dashboard from your WordPress dashboard to signup.</p>



<p>This process was tricky and a lot of WordPress users were abandoning the signup because they felt it was not a WordPress integrated experience.</p>



<p>Since the signup process was long and boring people were installing the plugin and after few days uninstalling it because of that.</p>



<p>This behaviour brought down the active install growth percentage and we started losing a few positions.</p>



<p>This is what we have done to fix this. 👇🏻</p>



<p>The signup process and linking between your WordPress website and the Customerly live chat ID was a 10-step long painful process.</p>



<p>We lowered down this signups process to 2 steps:</p>



<ul><li>Add a password</li><li>Click a button</li></ul>



<p>And you are now ready to go.</p>



<p>We focused on removing all possible frictions.</p>



<p>That was it.</p>



<p>That brought 10 times the installs we had before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So the signups.</p>



<p>“Make it easy” and do not over complicate the process is always the key.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wordpress_Live_Chat_Plugin_Downloads.jpg?ssl=1" alt="WP Live Chat Downloads per day" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wordpress_Live_Chat_Plugin_Downloads.jpg?w=1002&amp;ssl=1 1002w, https://i0.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wordpress_Live_Chat_Plugin_Downloads.jpg?resize=300%2C298&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wordpress_Live_Chat_Plugin_Downloads.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wordpress_Live_Chat_Plugin_Downloads.jpg?resize=768%2C763&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>



<p>I wasn’t still happy with the rank, I wanted to be in the top 5 positions.</p>



<p>But how?</p>



<h2>WordPress Support Forum</h2>



<p>I discovered that forum’s support requests are public and ranked. I started wondering if they could affect the ranking.</p>



<p>If you think about it, the more support requests related to the keyword you are optimizing you have, the more people might find the right plugin in what you have.</p>



<p>So I thought to send people there to ask for support about the live chat.</p>



<p>After 5 support tickets with the keywords in the question and the answer made the trick.</p>



<p>You can access to the support with this url: <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/customerly/">https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/customerly/</a></p>



<p>We were above HubSpot and just below LiveChat. Boom 💥&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Are Ratings really important?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>I started wondering if ratings might affect the ranking as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I was analyzing the positions on the charts, I’ve created a small piece of software to check everyday movements of the plugins, their reviews, average review and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wordpress_Live_Chat_downloads.jpg?fit=1024%2C497&amp;ssl=1" alt="WP Live Chat downloads SaaS " srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wordpress_Live_Chat_downloads.jpg?w=1256&amp;ssl=1 1256w, https://i1.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wordpress_Live_Chat_downloads.jpg?resize=300%2C146&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wordpress_Live_Chat_downloads.jpg?resize=1024%2C497&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wordpress_Live_Chat_downloads.jpg?resize=768%2C373&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></figure>



<p>It seemed to be not as important as the support tickets.</p>



<p>But I wanted to give them a try.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The strategy here was simple and lean-to implement. I’ve added two ways to ask for reviews:</p>



<ul><li>Customerly Funnels with a Bonus Email (5 minutes)</li><li>Review Links in the plugin (30 minutes of develop time)</li></ul>



<p>The Funnel</p>



<figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Customerly_Live_Chat_Plugin_Funnel_for_Reviews-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C626&amp;ssl=1" alt="Funnel for Live Chat WP Reviews" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Customerly_Live_Chat_Plugin_Funnel_for_Reviews-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;ssl=1 2560w, https://i2.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Customerly_Live_Chat_Plugin_Funnel_for_Reviews-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C183&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Customerly_Live_Chat_Plugin_Funnel_for_Reviews-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C626&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Customerly_Live_Chat_Plugin_Funnel_for_Reviews-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C469&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Customerly_Live_Chat_Plugin_Funnel_for_Reviews-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C938&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Customerly_Live_Chat_Plugin_Funnel_for_Reviews-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1251&amp;ssl=1 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></figure>



<p>I’ve created a behavioural funnel with <a href="https://www.customerly.io/en/visual-marketing-sales-funnel-automation?utm_campaign=wpoptim&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=Customerly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Customerly Funnels</a> to deliver an email to all our WordPress amazing users after few days from the install of their Customerly Live Chat on their website.</p>



<div id=""><div><div><div><h3>Get the most out of your SaaS by using Behavioural Funnels</h3><p>Trigger messages or emails based on your customers’ behaviour on your SaaS</p></div></div></div></div>



<p>The email goes straight to the point: if you leave an honest review of the live chat, we will give you the Pro plan for free for 3 months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is the actual email body:</p>



<div><div>
<p>” Hey {{name}},<br>thank you so much for installing our WordPress plugin 🙏</p>



<p>We have a bonus for you!</p>



<p>🔥 3 months of PRO plan when you drop us a sincere&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/customerly/reviews/#new-post">WordPress review.</a></p>



<p>👉 To get the 3 months for free all you need to do is:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/customerly/reviews/#new-post">Write a sincere review here</a></li><li>Reply to this email with your username you have used.</li></ul>



<p>Once we receive your email back we will personally send you a coupon code with your 3 months bonus.</p>



<p>Done deal?”</p>








</div></div>



<p>[I’ve crafted and shared with everyone a ready-to-use <a href="https://www.customerly.io/en/visual-marketing-sales-funnel-automation?utm_campaign=wpoptim&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=Customerly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">funnel template</a> to ask for reviews]</p>



<p>The funnel email hack worked. We have got immediately 10+ reviews and it was still working in terms of reviews left when we decided to turn it off.</p>

          <p>Some weeks ago I asked a few of the Codelitt team members a simple question:</p><blockquote>“What is UX?”</blockquote><p>I was happy that no one shied away from answering, and the difference in their responses was incredible:</p><p><strong>Engineers</strong> focused their answers in very pragmatic areas that all revolved around <em>friction</em> and how to reduce it. The experience “behind the curtain” that helps make interactions smooth was what they thought of. Things like loading times or making sure that buttons were clickable came to their minds.</p><p><strong>Designers</strong> saw the importance of researching both the users and business who would be investing in the product. They cared about making sure that the brand’s values were enhancing the experience. They wanted the users &amp; customers to know exactly what to expect when interacting with their products.</p><p><strong>Project Managers</strong> focused on understanding and empathizing with the users so that the end product is intuitive and useful to the user.</p><figure><img src="https://res-2.cloudinary.com/hepw4b4yn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/codelitt-user-experience.jpg"></figure><p>Simply put, UX means “User Experience”: it’s the experience that a user has while interacting with a product. UX <em>Design</em> is, by definition, the process by which we determine what that experience will be.</p><p>UX Design always happens. Whether it’s intentional or not, somebody makes the decisions about how the human and the product will interact. <em>Good</em> UX Design happens when we make these decisions in a way that understands and fulfills the needs of both our users and our business.</p><p>UX encompasses so many disciplines that it’s unfair to think of it as a sphere within visual design. Quite the contrary! The building of an interface is a <em>subset</em> of that product’s experience design.</p><figure><img src="https://res-3.cloudinary.com/hepw4b4yn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/codelitt-ux.jpg"></figure><p><strong>UX happens whenever a human interacts with a product</strong>. Any product. Take a pencil, for example. There’s the way that the wood, plastic or metal feels on your hand, the way it falls on your fingers, the feel of the graphite against the paper. Does it have a rubber end or a button you have to press to get the graphite out? In every case, it’s all been thoroughly thought out and designed, each component a part of the experience of writing with a pencil.</p><p>From the business objective, to the product’s stakeholders, designers, engineers and project managers, the experience encompasses every person working on it. It is the culmination of a multitude of disciplines working together. Every decision we make when building a product shapes that experience. UX is at the heart of everything we do.</p>

<![CDATA[Show HN: Screenr – Automated Workflow for Your Email]]>

July 9, 2020 | https://www.feval.ca/posts/screenr/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.feval.ca/posts/screenr/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    
    



<p>I tried <a href="https://www.hey.com/">Hey</a>, the new e-mail service built by Basecamp. It is great, simple, smart. They’ve put a lot of thoughts behind re-inventing email. There are some pretty interesting features but fundamentally what is different is the opinionated workflow on which it operates.</p>

<p>The only mail that lends into the “Imbox” (how they name the important inbox) is from senders the user allowed. The first time they receive an email from someone, it ends in a staging zone, and then the user need to screen senders and decide if they want to receive emails from them, and where they want these email to lend: 1. in the imbox, 2. in a set of “feeds” (email that is casually read), 3. in the “paper trail” (receipts, …).</p>

<p>I liked the overall experience of Hey, and was about to subscribe. However there are two things that are a no-go for me. It doesn’t support custom domains for email addresses (yet)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, and there is no “archive” feature<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. So I decided against that.</p>

<p>But I really liked the workflow, and I figured it shouldn’t be that big of a deal to re-create something similar in a plain-old mailbox.</p>



<p>Here’s what I need:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Senders need to be screened for their spam to be allowed in my inbox. I figured this can probably be done by redirecting mail from senders I never screened into a sub-folder and reviewing that occasionally.</li>
  <li>Screening senders need to be dead easy. That’s the beauty of Hey: screening is done by clicking on a thumbs-up or thumbs-down button. That’s why it works, no non-sense of creating or editing rules.</li>
  <li>Support the same kind of classifying structure. I already had a <em>newsletter</em> folder with a few manually created rules, and a <em>reference</em> folder in which I would occasionally put a mail that I wanted to retrieve easily - this is just automating that.</li>
  <li>Works from my computer or my phone, using existing apps. There is no point in starting a multi-month project and implement a working email UI, this needs to fit within my limited evenings and kids naps.</li>
  <li>Low maintenance, for the same reason.</li>
</ol>



<p>So I built <a href="https://github.com/cfe84/screenr">Screenr</a>.</p>

<p>Screenr plugs to an email server<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>, monitors email in folders, and classifies email into a set of folders.</p>

<p>Incoming emails from unknown senders (i.e. with an email address that has not been seen yet) are moved to a “For screening” folder. Emails from screened senders are moved based on configuration: either leave in the inbox, or move it to a particular folder.</p>

<pre><code>graph TD
	A[Inbound mail] --&gt; B(Inbox)
	B --&gt; C["Sender screened?"]
	C --&gt;|No| D("Move to 'For Screening'")
	C --&gt;|Yes| E(Move to configured folder)
</code></pre>

<p>To configure the tool, I just need to screen emails in the “For screening” folder occasionally, and move them based on where I want these to land: move emails from senders I still want in my inbox to a <em>Screened</em> folder (which then gets moved back into the inbox once Screenr registered the decision). Move emails I want to reject to a <em>Rejected</em> folder. Move emails I barely care about, such as newsletters, promotions, etc. into a <em>newsletter</em> folder. Move receipts, booking confirmations, order tracking info, tax documents, etc. into a <em>Reference</em> folder. If I move a single email between two monitored folder, then Screenr will move all of the mail from that sender into the new folder.</p>

<pre><code>graph TD
	A[For screening] --&gt; C[Decide what to do with this sender]
	C --&gt;|Allow in inbox| D("Move to 'Screened'")
	C --&gt;|Ok but classify elsewhere| E(Move to the folder you want)
	C --&gt;|Don't want mail from them| F(Move to 'Rejected')
</code></pre>

<p>Screenr supports two configurations (at the folder level) to classify email: either move the email directly to the target folder, or through an intermediary “classification” folder (like the “Screened” folder for email for inbox). The reason for that is that you might want to occasionally classify email without creating a rule: e.g. if my spouse forwards me a booking confirmation it’s nice to file it into the <em>Reference</em> folder without automatically classifying everything she sends me as reference<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Bonus points: now I can change my default behavior for new email based on where I’m at. I archive email in my inbox - the reduced amount of email there makes inbox 0 much easier to attain - and delete email in the “newsletter” folder. Less thinking, inmore better.</p>



<p>There are 4 folders I’m watching:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.feval.ca/img/2020/screenr/folders.jpg" alt="The folders I'm monitoring"></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Inbox</em> is the email that I (probably) care about. Once I read it, I archive it.</li>
  <li><em>Newsletter</em> is the stuff that I’m occasionally browsing, but it’s mostly composed of automatically sent emails and newsletters and there’s likely no required action. Once I read it, I (most likely) delete it.</li>
  <li><em>Papertrail</em> receives all my order confirmation, plane tickets, vouchers, etc. It usually just stays there. I used to call it <em>Reference</em> but I like Hey’s name better. Some of the mail I manually move there, mostly when my parents send me a scan of a bank record, or my wife sends me some reservation, because I don’t want to classify them there.</li>
  <li><em>For screening</em> is all the mail that I’m receiving from senders I haven’t reviewed yet.</li>
</ul>

<p>When something arrives in <em>For screening</em>, first I get excited because that’s proof that Screenr still does its job. Then I decide what to do with it by moving it in one of the folders:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.feval.ca/img/2020/screenr/screening.jpg" alt="The folders I use for screening"></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Screened</em> is for emails I want in my inbox, like people I know, notifications I care about, etc. Screener registers my decision then move it (and potentially other emails by that sender) back into the inbox</li>
  <li><em>File in papertrail</em> is the same as screened, but for my <em>papertrail</em> folder.</li>
  <li><em>Rejected</em> is for what’s not exactly a spam, but I don’t actually want. Examples are emails from my car dealership, which is mostly spam, but which also sends me service confirmation once in a while, which I then go fishing in that folder and redirect to reference. Or companies who want me to wish them happy birthday:</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://www.feval.ca/img/2020/screenr/spam.jpg" alt="Example of some spammy email"></p>



<p>I wanted reasonable portability, my email provider recently released a bare-bones nodejs hosting and I figured I could give it a shot, so I settled for typescript. That host was hardly controllable, so I ended giving up and re-hosting onto the Kubernetes cluster from which you retrieved this static HTML page in a vastly over-complicated setup instead (more on this in <a href="https://www.feval.ca/posts/k8s-static/">this blog post</a>).</p>

<p>The application itself is decomposed into 4 layers following the onion architecture:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>domain</code>, contains the actual classification logic</li>
  <li><code>contracts</code>, contains interfaces and data exchange structures for the dependencies that the domain will need an implementation for, such as <code>IMailbox</code> which allows retrieving emails or moving them around, <code>Mails</code> which are those mails, or <code>IScreeningStorage</code> which provides interfaces to store screening behavior or retrieve it based on sender.</li>
  <li><code>infrastructure</code>, which are the particular implementations for those dependencies: an <code>IMAPMailbox</code> implementing <code>IMailbox</code> which provides said features for an IMAP server.</li>
  <li><code>application</code> which binds all the stuff together: loads configuration, instantiate infrastructure, inject in domain, then kick off the process.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the storage of screening results, I settled on a file-based system which stores everything in memory and serializes it back to a file in storage when new rules are detected.</p>

<p>Building the IMAP connector was the most painful. The client libraries in the node ecosystem are not super well maintained and documented<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>, I tried two, and diagnosing some issues I was having<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7">6</a></sup> was a straight pain that almost made me abandon. In retrospect I would probably pick .Net Core instead, given that the IMAP libraries are much more solid. If I want to make evolutions on that, I don’t exclude a rewrite ; the languages are sufficiently close that this wouldn’t be a big thing to do.</p>

<p>As mentioned, the hosting is done on a k8s cluster. A Helm chart specifies a single deployment with no service, and mounting a file share inside the container to store and retrieve the settings. Here is the extent of the infrastructure:</p>

<pre><code>graph TD
	  A[Pod] --&gt; C[File share]
</code></pre>



<p>To run Screenr, you need a computer that can run node ; ideally a server that you don’t turn off.</p>

<p>There are some optimizations that could be done. For starters, this could use IMAP notifications to actually listen for new mail, rather than reconnecting and checking every 20s. I went for the straight forward thing right now, not sure if it’ll be a problem. Also this could be extended to support more rules, but it might require some more UI work which I don’t want to do, so that’s it for now.</p>

The good news is that there are some reasonable strategies for estimating how much a given workload costs.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In this post, we’ll discuss five major problems that affect cost estimation, and touch upon the strategies we use to overcome these problems in the <a href="https://www.fairwinds.com/insights">Fairwinds Insights</a> cost dashboard. We’ll present a more in-depth review of right sizing in a forthcoming blog.</p>
<h2><strong>Problem #1: Bin Packing</strong></h2>
<p>Say we have a Node, which costs us $20/month. Say it has 5GB of memory and 5 CPUs we can put to use. (Note: this isn’t a very realistic node, but it makes the diagrams and math come out nice 🙂)</p>
<p><img src="https://www.fairwinds.com/hubfs/Blog-Problems%20with%20Kubernetes%20Cost%20Estimation%20Strategies.png" alt="Image of squares 2x5 of CPU and Memory"></p>
<p>And here’s a workload, which needs 2 GB of memory, and 2 CPUs in order to run:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.fairwinds.com/hubfs/Blog-Problems%20with%20Kubernetes%20Cost%20Estimation%20Strategies-1.png" alt="Image of squares 2x2 of CPU and Memory"></p>

<p>We can fit up to two Pods worth of this workload in a single node:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.fairwinds.com/hubfs/Blog-Problems%20with%20Kubernetes%20Cost%20Estimation%20Strategies-3.png" alt="Image of squares 2x5 of CPU and Memory with 2 squares not used"></p>

<p>But if we want to add a third Pod for the workload, there’s not enough space left. So we’ll need to add (and pay for) a new node:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.fairwinds.com/hubfs/Blog-Problems%20with%20Kubernetes%20Cost%20Estimation%20Strategies-2.png" alt="Image of squares two 2x5 of CPU and Memory. In the first 2 squares are empty. In the second 6 squares are empty."></p>

<p>Note that there’s a little bit of wasted space on our first node - we’ve got 1GB of memory and 1CPU just sitting there. And our second node is very underutilized - less than half its resources are getting put to use.</p>
<p><strong>This is the first and primary problem of cost estimation</strong>: Kubernetes can’t split up one pod across multiple nodes. So if a whole number of pods don’t fit inside a single node, you’re going to have a certain amount of capacity that’s going to waste.</p>
<p><strong>Solution: </strong>One solution here is to “right-size” the nodes. If we used a node with 4GB of memory and 4CPUs, our workload would fit perfectly, and there’d be no capacity going to waste:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.fairwinds.com/hubfs/Blog-Problems%20with%20Kubernetes%20Cost%20Estimation%20Strategies-Jul-09-2020-02-08-40-46-PM.png" alt="CPU and Memory 2x4 squares completely filled"></p>

<h2><strong>Problem #2: Resource Asymmetry</strong></h2>
<p>Let’s consider a different kind of workload: one that’s very CPU-intensive. It needs 3 CPUs to run, but only 1GB of memory.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.fairwinds.com/hubfs/Blog-Problems%20with%20Kubernetes%20Cost%20Estimation%20Strategies-Jul-09-2020-02-08-46-96-PM.png" alt="Image of squares. Column 1 is x3 squares, column 2 is 1 square"></p>

<p>Now we can only fit 1 Pod worth of this workload into a single Node (using our 4CPU/4GB example):</p>
<p><img src="https://www.fairwinds.com/hubfs/Blog-Problems%20with%20Kubernetes%20Cost%20Estimation%20Strategies-4.png" alt="2 columns of 4 by 2 rows. CPU has three squares filled, 1 memory square filled"></p>

<p>There’s a ton of unused capacity going to waste here - not only 1 CPU, but also 3 GB of memory. We’re only using half the Node, but if we want to spin up a second Pod, we’ll need a second Node, with the same amount of waste!</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Again, we’ll want to right-size our nodes - cloud providers offer CPU-intensive and Memory-intensive nodes to handle exactly this problem.</p>
<h2><strong>Problem #3: Cost Attribution</strong></h2>
<p>Let’s say our smaller Node (4 CPUs and 4 GB) costs $16/mo. Using those numbers, we can come up with a rough estimate for how much each CPU and each GB of memory costs us. Say, of that $16, $8 goes to CPU, and $8 goes to memory. We can then infer that we’re paying $2 per CPU, and $2 per GB of memory.</p>
<p>So how much does our original workload cost us per pod?</p>

<p><img src="https://www.fairwinds.com/hubfs/Blog-Problems%20with%20Kubernetes%20Cost%20Estimation%20Strategies-Jul-09-2020-02-08-40-52-PM.png" alt="2x2 square with 4 boxes"></p>

<p>Based on our math above, we’d say <code>$2/CPU * 2CPUs + $2/GB * 2GBs = $8.</code> Which makes sense - we can fit exactly two of these workloads on a $16 node. For reasons we’ll cover below, we call this <strong>the optimistic method</strong> of cost estimation.</p>
<p>But what about our second workload, the CPU-intensive one?</p>

<p><img src="https://www.fairwinds.com/hubfs/Blog-Problems%20with%20Kubernetes%20Cost%20Estimation%20Strategies-Jul-09-2020-02-08-46-96-PM.png" alt="Image of squares. Column 1 is x3 squares, column 2 is 1 square"></p>

<p>Let’s do the same math: <code>$2/CPU * 3CPUs + $2/GB * 1GB = $8.</code> So the <strong>optimistic method</strong> says this workload costs us $8. But as we saw above, we can only fit one of them per Node. So in reality, it’s costing us $16/mo, and the optimistic method doesn’t seem so accurate.</p>
<p>Is there another method of cost estimation that might give us a more reasonable answer? There is!</p>
<p>Instead of adding the CPU cost and the memory cost together, we can take the <em>maximum</em> of the two. This helps us account for memory-intensive or CPU-intensive workloads, that might cause extra capacity to go to waste. (Note that we’ll also need to multiply the result by 2, so we count the missing resource as well.)</p>
<p>So the math becomes <code>MAX($2/CPU * 3CPUs, $2/GB * 1GB) * 2 = $12.</code> This is a good deal closer to the $16 target. The remainder is attributable to the fully unused node capacity (i.e. the 1 CPU that is still going to waste, despite the fact that the Node carries a CPU-intensive workload).</p>
<p>We call this <strong>the conservative method</strong> of estimation. It prepares for a worst-case scenario in terms of Kubernetes’ ability to bin-pack workloads onto your Nodes.</p>
<p>For many workloads, the conservative method and the optimistic method will give similar estimates, but they diverge for CPU- or memory-intensive workloads. The basic difference is that the optimistic method assumes optimal bin-packing, while the conservative method assumes there will be some waste. Say, for instance, that we were also running a memory-intensive workload, one that needs only 1 CPU, but 3 GB of memory:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.fairwinds.com/hubfs/Blog-Problems%20with%20Kubernetes%20Cost%20Estimation%20Strategies-Jul-09-2020-02-08-46-90-PM.png" alt="1 square in column 1, 3 squares in column 2"></p>

<p>Kubernetes is smart enough to pack this together with our CPU-intensive workload, saving us the unused capacity:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.fairwinds.com/hubfs/Blog-Problems%20with%20Kubernetes%20Cost%20Estimation%20Strategies-Jul-09-2020-02-08-40-35-PM.png" alt="CPU intensive workloads combined so 2x4 squares are all used"></p>

<p>The <strong>conservative method</strong> would say that each of these workloads costs $12, for a total cost of $24. But Kubernetes has found a way to pack them into a $16 Node! We’ve overshot. That’s why it’s called <strong>conservative</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>optimistic method</strong> accounts for the clever bin packing, and would say that each of these workloads costs $8, for a total cost of $16, which is a perfect estimate, given that they fit exactly onto one $16 node.</p>
<p><strong>Solution: </strong>So which one should you use? The answer is that it depends. If you’ve spent time optimizing your instance types, or if your nodes are much larger than your average workload, there’s a good chance that Kubernetes can find a way to pack workloads together in a cost-efficient way, and you can safely choose the <strong>optimistic</strong> method. Otherwise, we recommend the <strong>conservative</strong> method.</p>
<h2><strong>Problem #4: Resource Ranges</strong></h2>
<p>Another issue at hand is the fact that a Kubernetes workload doesn’t just use a fixed amount of CPU and memory. Resource usage can vary from second to second, and Pods may get killed or moved between nodes in response to these fluctuations.</p>
<p>To help with this issue, Kubernetes configuration gives engineers two fields for managing resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>requests</code> set the minimum resource usage of the workload. When a workload gets scheduled on a Node, you can be sure that <em>at least this much</em> is available</li>
<li><code>limits</code> set the maximum resource usage of the workload. When a Pod for the workload tries to use more than this amount, the Pod <em>will get killed</em> and a new one will start.</li>
</ul>
<p>The actual resource usage of a given workload will be somewhere between these two numbers, and will fluctuate heavily from second to second (just look at the Activity Monitor on your macbook to see how much this can vary!).</p>
<p><strong>Solution: </strong>One way of estimating bottom-line workload cost is to look at that fluctuating number, and take an average over time. Another way of estimating workload cost is to look at <code>requests</code> and <code>limits</code> in order to provide a range of possibilities, or to take an average of the two.</p>
<p>Since Fairwinds Insights is primarily concerned with <a href="https://www.fairwinds.com/insights">configuration validation</a><strong>,</strong> we opt for the second strategy - we want to tell you, <em>given your current configuration</em>, how much you can expect this workload to cost.</p>
<h2><strong>Problem #5: Noisy Neighbors</strong></h2>
<p>Kubernetes can only do its best with the information it's given. This is why it’s so important to specify <code>requests</code> and <code>limits</code> for every single one of your workloads.</p>
<p>For example, if one of your workloads duly requests 1GB of memory, but another workload on the same node hasn’t set <code>requests</code> or <code>limits,</code> the second workload could easily begin to gobble up all the resources available on that Node. This could prevent our original workload from getting all the memory it needs, hurting its performance.</p>
<p>Because it can be tricky to dial these settings in, some teams never set requests or limits at all, while others set them too high during initial testing and then never course correct. To appropriately estimate cost, we need to set the right limits and requests. Fairwinds Insights uses <a href="https://github.com/FairwindsOps/goldilocks/">Goldilocks</a>, a free open source tool, to analyze actual resource usage and recommend settings for <code>requests</code> and <code>limits</code> that are “just right”.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Understanding the financial costs of each of your organization’s applications impact is important, but when they’re all running together in Kubernetes, it can be quite difficult. Fortunately, there are some reasonable ways to solve each of the problems with Kubernetes cost estimation.</p>
<p>By using a combination of right-sizing (more to come on that), adopting the right methods (e.g. conservative vs. optimistic), and employing configuration validation tools like Fairwinds Insights and Goldilocks, you can ensure your Kubernetes deployments run efficiently.</p>

<p>The Roman roads diagram project is a series of maps driven by an unconventional idea: what if we represented Ancient Rome’s famed road network in the style of a modern transit map?</p>
<p>So far I’ve made five diagrams (below). Click for more information.</p>
<p>You can see how my style has evolved since I made the first map back in 2017. My ultimate goal is to make a book out of these. I’ll probably have to redesign a few of them.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p><time datetime="2020-07-09T00:00:00.000Z">July 9, 2020</time></p><div><p><a href="https://github.com/dragarcia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/26374889?s=400&amp;u=f5e35e9b47a50fa2b4d8c4bb96babd921071bcf1&amp;v=4" alt="Angelico de los Reyes"></a></p></div></header><section><p>Whenever you create a new database in Postgres, you are actually <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/manage-ag-templatedbs.html">basing it off an already present database</a> in your cluster. </p><p>This database, <code>template1</code>, and another, called <code>template0</code>, are standard system databases that exist in every newly created database cluster. Don't believe me? Why not quickly <a href="https://supabase.io/docs/postgres/postgres-intro">spin up a database</a> and see it for yourself with this query:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>SELECT</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>FROM</span><span> pg_database</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>In this post, we'll explore these template databases and see how we can make full use of their potential. We'll even look into creating a template database of our own.</p><h2>template1</h2><p>By default, running:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>DATABASE</span><span> new_db_name</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>simply copies everything from the database <code>template1</code>. We can modify this template database in any way: add a table, insert some data, create new extensions, or install procedural languages. Any of these actions would be propagated to subsequently created databases.</p><p>This, however, is <strong>not</strong> advisable. Removing any one of these modifications would need you to manually uninstall or drop these changes from <code>template1</code>. You do have the option to drop and recreate the entire <code>template1</code> database altogether. This unfortunately comes at the risk of committing a mistake along the way, effectively breaking <code>CREATE DATABASE</code>. It would be better to leave <code>template1</code> alone and create a template database of your own.</p><h2>Custom Template Databases</h2><p>To set an existing database as a template database:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>ALTER</span><span> </span><span>DATABASE</span><span> template_db_name </span><span>WITH</span><span> is_template </span><span>TRUE</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Doing this allows any user or role with the <code>CREATEDB</code> privilege to utilize it as a template. If not, only superusers or owners of the database would be allowed to do so.</p><p>To create a new database with this template:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>DATABASE</span><span> new_db_name TEMPLATE template_db_name</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><h3>Advantages</h3><ul><li>With this, you can now have customized templates without the need to worry about polluting <code>template1</code>.</li><li>You can safely drop the entire custom template database without the risk of breaking <code>CREATE DATABASE</code>.</li><li>If you wish, you can create multiple template databases for various use cases.</li></ul><h3>Limitations</h3><ul><li>To properly create a database from a custom template database, there should be no other connections present. <code>CREATE DATABASE</code> immediately fails if any connections exist at the start of the query.</li><li>As such, if you are looking to replicate a database while maintaining your connections (eg. a production database), it would be more ideal to use the Postgres utility <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/app-pgdump.html">pg_dump</a>.</li></ul><h2>template0</h2><p><code>template0</code> contains the same data as <code>template1</code>. We could think of this template database as a fallback if anything irreversible happens to <code>template1</code>. As such, this template database should never be modified in any way as soon as the database cluster has been initialized. To create a database with <code>template0</code> as the template database:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>DATABASE</span><span> new_db_name TEMPLATE template0</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><h3>Applications</h3><ul><li>If anything goes wrong with <code>template1</code>, It can be dropped and recreated with <code>template0</code> as the template database.</li><li>We can also create a clean database that does not contain any modifications present in <code>template1</code>. This would be useful when restoring from pg_dump. Any conflicts brought about by modifications not present in the dump are eliminated.</li><li><code>template0</code> can be used to specify new encodings. As pointed out in this <a href="https://hashrocket.com/blog/posts/exploring-the-default-postgres-template-databases#:~:text=we%20can't%20edit%20the%20locale%20or%20encoding%20of%20a%20database%20copied%20from%20template1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article</a>, creating a new database with <code>template1</code> and new encodings would result in an error.</li></ul><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span></span><span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>DATABASE</span><span> new_db_name TEMPLATE template0 ENCODING </span><span>'SQL_ASCII'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>DATABASE</span><span> new_db_name ENCODING </span><span>'SQL_ASCII'</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>To quickly sum things up, we found out that new databases are, by default, created from a template database called <code>template1</code>. <code>template1</code> can be modified in any way we please and the changes would be present in any database created afterward. We can also create custom template databases and base new databases from them instead. If things go awry, <code>template0</code> is always there to help.</p></section><section><a href="http://eepurl.com/gPWkwn">SUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER</a></section></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><p id="7416">When I first started building Percy over five years ago, I honestly had no idea where it would go. What I was sure about, though, was that it was a problem I was genuinely interested in solving, and I just wanted to build it.</p><p id="f0da">Fast forward to today, and we have both a product and a team that I am super proud of, passionate users and customers who love Percy, and most importantly, we have successfully made the previously-obscure phrase “visual testing” commonplace in the tech industry and across developer communities. Achieving this was no small feat, and I’m thrilled that Percy has played a pivotal role in making that happen.</p><h2 id="7f25">What’s next</h2><p id="b175">I am excited about all the opportunities that this acquisition will unlock. BrowserStack has spent over nine years building a platform that enables millions of developers and QA engineers worldwide to test across thousands of browsers and devices at scale. Similarly, Percy has spent the last five years focusing on a new category of testing — one that sits at the intersection of design, development, and deployment, with a significant overlap with browser automation and developer workflows.</p><p id="a79a">Though our paths have been adjacent until now, our capabilities fit perfectly together to create a comprehensive testing experience for users.</p><p id="fe68">Percy has invested heavily in the intricacies of visual testing and embedded deeply and easily in the workflows of thousands of developers. Being part of the BrowserStack platform will open many doors for expanding visual testing to a much wider range of testing environments.</p><p id="87c8">On the personal front, I will continue to lead Percy as Director of Product for Visual Testing. I’m very excited about this role and the changes it brings.</p><p id="eff3">It seems like every founder’s acquisition post ends up with this statement at some point, so I’ll get it out of the way — it’s <em>hard </em>to build and run a startup! Though my focus was always the product and team, as co-founder a lot of my time and energy were also spent managing day-to-day business activities. With this acquisition I am happy to be able to get back to my roots in product and engineering.</p><h2 id="f495">Thank you</h2><p id="0d41">I get to be the public face of this change, but we would never have gotten this far or created this powerful new product without the tireless work of the entire Percy team. I want to thank you for all the hard work, passion, and the empathy that you bring to work each day. A special thanks for riding the many rollercoasters of change during the shared tough times that the world is going through right now. I’m thankful to be able to work with each one of you.</p><p id="ba6b">And finally, a big thanks to all our users and customers for your continued support and belief in us. You give us the energy behind everything we do and we will be looking forward to your feedback on how to continue to make Percy better and better.</p><p id="9a2e">You can read more about the acquisition on the <a href="https://www.browserstack.com/blog/browserstack-has-acquired-percy?utm_source=announcement_blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=percy_acquisition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BrowserStack blog</a>.</p></div></div></section></div>]]>

<h3><strong>Rule 4.1 of the developer constitution</strong></h3>



<p>It’s the law. Software engineers have to hate meetings. If you’re caught enjoying yourself in a meeting you can get your dev card pulled. So be careful out there. And stay classy, San Diego.</p>







<div><figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ron-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ron-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ron-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ron-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ron.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>







<h2><strong>We’re bad at articulating the negative effects of meetings</strong></h2>



<p>I knew right away as a junior developer out of college I was in too many meetings. Even though I had nothing to compare it to. As I took on more visible projects, the number of meetings went up. I felt the pain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three years into my career, I got <a href="https://linearb.io/blog/promoted-from-dev-to-team-lead-8-things-they-didnt-tell-me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promoted from dev to team lead</a> and bam… not only was I in more meetings than ever but my team was also constantly complaining to me they were in too many meetings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I remember being in product strategy meetings for hours. HOURS.&nbsp;</p>

<div><p>After I got comfortable with our product leaders and executive team, I would spin my chair around in circles as a (passive aggressive) way of letting them know I was ready to go.</p><p>Looking back on it, I wasn’t addressing the bigger issue. Another long meeting was right around the corner. And I wasn’t doing anything to help other developers in our org avoid meetings that were too long or had no value.&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>In general, I was good at <a href="https://linearb.io/blog/being-vp-of-software-development-is-harder-than-being-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">translating between engineers and executives</a>. But for some reason, when it came to meetings, I failed to find the words.&nbsp;</p>







<h2><strong>“Too many meetings” is not a complaint, it’s a cry for help</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://linearb.io/blog/stand-up-2-0-ten-community-insights-from-100-responses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I’ve been asking developers why they don’t like meetings</a> and what specifically they don’t like about them. The more I parse what I’m hearing and compare it to my own experience, the more I think “too many meetings” is a symptom of a bigger issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most developers don’t arbitrarily dislike all meetings. When we say we don’t like meetings what we really mean is:</p>



<ul><li>“I dislike inefficiency”</li><li>“I dislike poorly planned meetings”</li><li>“I dislike poorly executed meetings”</li><li>“I dislike not living up to my promises”</li><li>“I dislike missing our team iteration deadline”</li><li>“I dislike not getting enough time to do my job”</li></ul>







<p>Developers are the most important asset innovative companies have. Instead of dismissing this feedback as “engineers just don’t like meetings”, we need to listen to them.&nbsp;</p>







<h3><strong>Maker’s Schedule versus Manager’s Schedule</strong></h3>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paul4-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paul4-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paul4-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paul4-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paul4.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>







<p>When it comes to meetings, there is an inherent tension between developers and bosses. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paul Graham</a> (pictured above), known for his work on LISP and for co-founding Y Combinator, explains the disconnect in his 2009 essay <strong><em>Maker’s Schedule, Manager’s Schedule</em></strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a summary:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Bosses (Managers) get stuff done through meetings – changing tasks every 60 minutes.<br></li><li>Developers (Makers) and other creators need 3-4 hour blocks of time to get work done.<br></li><li>Each way of working is perfectly fine by itself but problems arise when the two collide.<br></li><li>For a Maker, a single meeting at the wrong time can disrupt their entire day of work.<br></li><li>Powerful people on a Manager Schedule force Makers to “resonate at their frequency.”&nbsp;</li></ul>







<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paul3-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paul3-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paul3-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paul3-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paul3.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>







<p>We’ve all been there. Your VP needs an update on feature XYZ. They “have a call with customer ABC tomorrow” or they’re “presenting to the exec team this afternoon” so they summon you and the team. You share your status update. Or, worse, someone else talks and you just sit there. (Why did I need to be here??) Your boss asks a few questions. You leave.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And it’s not just your VP. Your team lead, your product owner, your project manager, your UX designer… they all want your time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And it’s just not just meetings. The support person, the salesperson… they all have a “quick question” and it’s always “kind of urgent”. At least now they can’t walk by your desk when you don’t answer on Slack after 57 seconds. But you want to be helpful so it’s still a distraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your boss goes on to their next meeting. The sales rep goes to their next call. For you, it’s not that easy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You have to start your process all over. “Getting in the zone” takes time. And if you have another meeting in an hour you might not want to start something big or important. So you get up to date in Slack. Maybe pick up a friend’s PR and add some comments. Next thing you know the day is over and you didn’t get enough quality time into your big, important task.&nbsp;</p>







<h3><strong>Two failed attempts&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>When I was Director of Engineering (and later VP), I considered myself a “cool” leader. Not one of those out of touch suits. Not some MBA that talked about innovation but didn’t actually know how to code. (Python dice rolling simulator doesn’t count, Conner!) I was an executive but I still understood what it was like to be a developer. After all, I had just been a developer. I got promoted from dev to team lead to Director in a two-year span. I was not out of touch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet I was the cause of many meetings and interruptions. What was my alternative? I needed updates so I could <a href="https://linearb.io/blog/vp-engineering-vp-product-how-to-keep-a-united-front/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">communicate with our VP of Product</a> and our CEO. Jira was never up to date. Slack worked sometimes but not always in the timeframe I needed.</p>







<p><strong>PRO TIP FOR MANAGERS:</strong> Beware of how you feel when you leave a meeting with your team. The meeting was for you and you got work done so you’re probably feeling great. Your team probably did not get work done and might not be feeling as great. Don’t allow your feelings to cause your mind to overvalue the meeting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eventually, I heard enough complaints and tried to do something about it.&nbsp;</p>







<h4><strong>Failed idea #1: No meeting Wednesday</strong></h4>



<p>We looked for a day each week where devs could work uninterrupted. After much negotiation, we picked Wednesday. We would meet up for the daily then no more meetings all day. None. No exceptions. I convinced the CEO and the whole company. Everyone agreed! It lasted about three weeks. By week four the “urgent priority” meeting requests started rolling in again. And by week five my own team had lost their resolve and we were right back to meetings on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>







<h4><strong>Failed idea #2: Brazilian BBQ meat coaster&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>At <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/brazilian-barbecue-history-335804" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brazilian BBQ </a>restaurants “Gauchos” bring skewers of meat to your table. If you want some, they cut a few pieces on to your plate. If you don’t want any of that particular meat, no worries. A few minutes later another pair of chaps will be by with a new kind of meat. (It’s amazing.)</p>



<p>How does the gaucho know if you want more meat? Your table has a little cube or coaster on it. Green side up means more meat! Red side up means I have the meat sweats and I’m taking a break. See where I’m going with this?</p>



<p>I gave everyone on our team a little coaster. Green side up meant I’m available to chat. Red side up meant please don’t interrupt. I sent an email to the whole company.&nbsp;</p>







<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zone-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zone-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zone-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zone-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zone.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>What’s worse: meat sweats or meeting sweats?</figcaption></figure>







<p>It lasted a brief time. But eventually, the shoulder tap interruptions resumed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why did these attempts fail? I didn’t explain the problem well enough. The “rules” we implemented seemed arbitrary to everyone else. We had a great relationship with our ecosystem so they bought in initially because they wanted to be helpful. But, in order for change to take hold, people need to understand the “why”. And the “why” in this case has to be more than just devs don’t like meetings and interruptions.&nbsp;</p>







<h2><strong>5 steps for reducing meetings and increasing focus time blocks&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Dev team leads, scrum masters, product leaders, and business leaders can use these ideas to maximize the most valuable “resource” in your company – your developers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Developers can use it too. If you’re like me – complaining about meetings but not explaining your “why” very well – this framework will help you articulate yourself better.</p>







<h3><strong>Step 1: Take a meeting inventory and establish a baseline</strong></h3>



<p>Are we really in too many meetings? As we start educating our company about “why” meetings and interruptions are bad for developers, let’s also make sure our premise is correct.</p>



<p>To start, let’s look at the recurring meetings we’re in:</p>







<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chart-New-alignment-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chart-New-alignment-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chart-New-alignment-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chart-New-alignment-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chart-New-alignment.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>







<p>Most reasonable developers are not proposing to get rid of these so this becomes your baseline.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Add up the total number of hours and divide by the total number of hours in your typical iteration. At LinearB, these baseline meetings take up 10% of our typical two-week iteration. Not bad, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now look at your random meetings: update with your product owner for feature XYZ, check-in with the support department, technical design, UX design, emergency production issue, etc. These take up a lot more time if we aren’t careful. So, examine their value closely.&nbsp;</p>







<h3><strong>Step 2: Assess the value of your meetings</strong></h3>



<p>Are all of our recurring and random meetings providing value to attendees? It depends on who you ask. They’re definitely valuable for the person scheduling them like the Director, team lead or product owner. But are they valuable for developers?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The daily stand-up is our most important, most frequent meeting. And yet many developers don’t think they get value from it.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p><strong>LinearB is reinventing the daily stand-up.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://linearb.io/standup-2-0/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">See how our automated team dashboard correlates Git and Jira to help you eliminate useless status updates, see who needs help, and get back to work faster.</a></strong></p></blockquote></figure>

Focus on blocked work. <a href="http://linearb.io/standup-2-0/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Click here to get early access.</a></figcaption></figure>







<p>At <a href="https://linearb.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LinearB</a>, we refactored our meetings and created two core tenets:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Everyone in the room must get value – especially developers.&nbsp;</li><li>No status update meetings are allowed.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>For engineering leaders, if you listen to your team, you’ll quickly learn which meetings are not delivering value. But just canceling those meetings may be complicated. Other stakeholders may find them valuable. So, instead of canceling, ask yourself “how can I refactor this meeting to make it more useful to my team?”&nbsp;</p>







<p>Here’s an example:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Marketing teams should scale alongside new business revenue. As the company generates new business, the marketing budget gets bigger and the team scales accordingly.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Companies often think about go-to-market (GTM) spend in terms of payback periods - if we put a dollar into the business today, how long will it take to get that dollar back in terms of revenue. For example, if we spent $15m on GTM in 2019 and generated $15m new business ARR in 2019 that would be a 12 month payback period. A 12 month payback is considered great for most SaaS businesses.&nbsp;<br></p><p>When you combine the idea of payback periods along with industry benchmarks for marketing spend you start to get a picture of what marketing budgets look like as you scale. According to <a href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5ea5d85d88b3bd3fa7481aab/5f0721b9c8fbf34510ac1da7_image%20(73).png" target="_blank">Keybanc</a>, SaaS companies spend between 15% and 50% of their go-to-market budget on marketing. </p><p>When you map out this percentage spend against payback periods, you start to get a sense of what your marketing budget at different revenue targets should look like.&nbsp;</p><figure id="w-node-5ab1cbc8e47a-32481ab0"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5ea5d85d88b3bd7015481ab4/5f06ab4c328260ba3799a145_marketngteam2.001.jpeg" alt=""></p></figure><div><p>The mix is largely determined by the sales motion. Generally, Self-serve SMB businesses require more marketing spend whereas enterprise sales heavy businesses require less marketing.&nbsp;</p></div><p>From here you can start to get a sense of what you can afford and how big your marketing team could be at each point in scale. Generally, marketing teams (full-time-employees) account for 35-40% of your marketing budget.&nbsp;<br></p><div><p>Another helpful datapoint comes from <a href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5ea5d85d88b3bd3fa7481aab/5f065bbf2b3d6331272bc36f_Insight_s_SaaS_Marketing_Spend_Benchmarks_Report.pdf" target="_blank">Insight Partners</a>, where they provide benchmarks for new logo bookings per marketing employee (FTE).&nbsp;</p></div><figure id="w-node-41bc96697126-32481ab0"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5ea5d85d88b3bd7015481ab4/5efbd440b708739085e5a3a8_qRW2yCCH9-9IoVtU_Y-tknGhkcROR8xbPL1pOipXzzoNWAsGs6gNpv4ESyzI4tmnSpsPOs-QmT6yTV9i_m7UjJ66d4d7wHRzTCwu6GzT_e-U3IC3iT33pJVrd_J5fNgBMMGu5ApO.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>As companies target bigger customers, individual marketers are able to support more revenue scaling from $498k/FTE to $1,238k/FTE. Bigger ACV companies typically have smaller marketing teams as the go-to-market strategy is more outbound sales led, rather than through digital growth marketing tactics.&nbsp;</p><p>By taking these benchmarks and extrapolating them against new business targets, you start to get a clear picture of what your marketing team should look like over time.&nbsp;<br>‍</p><figure id="w-node-b9a4ea7d9877-32481ab0"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5ea5d85d88b3bd7015481ab4/5f06ab6f3dc1fef5342db03a_marketngteam2.002.jpeg" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍<br></p><p>So for example, if I want to generate $9m in new business this year, and most of my customers pay me $50k each, then i’ll want to have a marketing team of around 11 people, but if i mainly focus on SMB customer then i’ll likely need a team of 18 people.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Of course, benchmarks and extrapolations only tell part of the story. Some companies index higher on programs vs. people. The exact mix depends on what you’ve found to work for your business in the past and what you want to experiment with in the future. Additionally,&nbsp; your capital position will naturally change your level of investment.</p><p>From personal experience, I found the above benchmarks to be a bit inflated to how we’ve built the team at Lattice.&nbsp; Historically, we’ve tended to operate a lean team of generalists, hire more contractors and indexed towards more program spend. But as we’ve added more specialization on the team, the numbers start to even out towards the above benchmarks.&nbsp;<br>‍</p><p>Regardless, understanding the relationship between new business targets, size of customer contracts, and go-to-market motion will help you to determine the size of your marketing team as the business grows.&nbsp;<br></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As part of recent design changes, GitHub has introduced READMEs for profiles. By <a href="https://dev.to/web/design-github-profile-using-readme-md-8al">creating a repo</a> with your name and adding <code>README.md</code> file with markdown to it, you can now add a rich description of yourself.</p><p>Here is an example of how it looks like:</p><p><img alt="Python reference count graph" src="https://rushter.com/static/uploads/img/github_profile.jpg" width="650"></p><p>This feature may not be available to your profile yet. GitHub uses selectively rolling.</p><p>Unlike the old plain-text bio field, the new feature supports external links and images. This is where it gets interesting.</p><h2>Tracking profile views</h2><p>Since Github's markdown can display images from external sources, you can now track and display views of your profile.</p><p>To do so, you need to host an image on your server and display it via Markdown syntax:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>image</span> <span>title</span><span>](</span><span>https</span><span>:</span><span>//rushter.com/counter.svg)</span>
</pre></div><p>On the server-side, each image request can be treated as a view of your profile. The rest of the story is simple — you need to store a counter in the database and return an SVG image with the number of views as a response. Of course, there will be some extra requests from bots, but having such statistics is better than nothing.</p><p>To prevent IP and User Agent leaking, GitHub caches all images via special proxy. To avoid being cached on Github servers after the first image request, your image must specify cache headers or return non-200 response (e.g., an HTTP 404 page).</p><p>Here is the HTTP header that disables caching:</p><div><pre><span></span>Cache-Control: max-age=0, no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate
</pre></div><p>This is not something new for repositories since they had this ability for a long time, and GitHub allows this kind of use of images for <a href="https://github.com/dwyl/repo-badges#github-repo-hit-counter-">interactive badges</a>. Unlike profiles, repositories have access to traffic statistics too.</p><p>Here is how it can <a href="https://github.com/rushter">look like</a> when you have access to the new feature:</p><p><img alt="Python reference count graph" src="https://rushter.com/static/uploads/img/github_counter.png" width="700"></p><p><br> There are libraries and services that can do <a href="https://github.com/brentvollebregt/hit-counter">this for you</a>. You can also use <a href="https://pipedream.com/@tod/github-profile-view-counter-p_G6CNmN/readme">Pipedream</a> if you want to have more control over the counter logic.</p><h3>Security aspects</h3><p>For a lot of people, allowing external images on their websites sounds like not a big deal. I've been using this technique to track profiles views on various platforms for more than 10 years. I've seen how recruiters constantly refresh my profiles when they need to make a decision :).</p><p>Unlike GitHub, most of them don't even bother proxying the image to hide IP, referrer, and browser agent. If you want to allow external images on your site, you <strong>must</strong> proxy them and hide everything about a person who requested it.</p><p>A person with bad intentions can trick a victim into opening your profile that looks completely legit and detect his IP and a browser. You can also set a cookie to track user visits on other websites, but browsers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21064698/google-third-party-cookies-chrome-two-years-privacy-safari-firefox">will soon stop</a> doing it.</p><p>A single-pixel image can provide you a lot of information. This is how the whole AD industry works when it tracks your visits on various websites.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>According to my tests, profile views do not count as repo views, and I hope, in the future, we will be able to see traffic stats in the repository that hosts the README file.</p></div></div>]]>

                    <p>All of a sudden, we’re all working from our living rooms and using remote tools and video calls to stay as connected as we can. The once-steady migration to working from home has suddenly leapt to 100% adoption. But in our collective loss of shared physical space, did we also lose all the things that come with it? Things that lead to freer, more organic conversation and <em>feeling</em> more together?</p><p>When we share a physical space, there's hundreds of tiny inter-personal interactions – opportunities for conversations to start – combined with a shared physical context. These give rise to something I call social serendipity: the chance for unstructured and unplanned conversations to take place. This is where people actually get to know each other, and where new ideas are born.</p><p>When designing the offices at Pixar, Steve Jobs asked that the only restrooms be placed in an atrium at the very centre of the office. Why? To quite intentionally force coworkers from across the organisation to bump into each other and mix together, striking up new conversations.</p><p>For social serendipity to really happen, you need a 'safe' environment for people to share thoughts with as little friction and consequence for a 'bad idea' as possible. When physically hanging out with friends, or sitting with coworkers that you have a good relationship with, this just happens naturally, but in a world where we all are physically distanced, something subtle is lost.</p><p><strong><br>There are two main things missing in today’s social apps which are there in a physical workplace: </strong></p><ol><li>A low-friction 'open channel' for conversation to flow (in an office, this is something like passively being near to others)</li><li>Conversation hooks – exposure to things to talk about (in an office, this can be observing something that someone is doing)<br></li></ol><h2 id="open-channels">Open channels</h2><p><br>When you use Slack, email, or WhatsApp, you are effectively posting a letter to somebody. It may be fast to deliver and small in size, but it’s still a letter. This type of communication is a little like playing ping pong in the dark: you know virtually nothing about the other player’s position or current state (with perhaps the only dim lightbulbs in the room being status notifications like ‘read’,'active’, or 'typing’). </p><figure><img src="https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/2020/07/ping-pong-in-the-dark.png" alt="" srcset="https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/ping-pong-in-the-dark.png 600w, https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/ping-pong-in-the-dark.png 1000w, https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/2020/07/ping-pong-in-the-dark.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The ping pong in the dark of messaging</figcaption></figure><div><p>What about voice or video calls? Well, they are little more like fishing: you throw out a line and if there’s a bite, the line is connected. But this can also be quite disruptive… much like how you catch a fish and pull it out from its environment (the river), the recipient of a phone call is pulled out from whatever they were doing. </p><p>Regardless, both of these different types of communication are very intentional, and by that I mean that you need a reason to reach out and start. This 'needing a reason' forms a viscous barrier to free flowing communication. </p><p>In both cases, once a ‘session’ (what I’m calling a natural, active conversation between people) is created, people can talk fairly freely within it. </p></div><p><br>In <em>synchronous</em> communication (so a voice or video call), the session is formal – it has an official connect and disconnect, and everyone knows the status. Within that, people can speak freely – kind of similarly to an in-person conversation… within the bounds of the intent of the session of course, as it’s so disruptive to whatever else that everyone wants to do.</p><div><p>In <em>asynchronous</em> communication (back-and-forth messaging), the session is informal, noncommittal, and doesn’t have a clear beginning or end. There is also a kind of <em>semi-synchronous</em> version that can happen when multiple parties are replying rapidly, but it still doesn’t need any reason to come to an end because it’s non-committal. </p><p><strong>If we were to put these into spatial terms: </strong></p></div><p><br>A video or voice call is like entering a temporary room – you can see who else is there, and everyone else knows you are there. However, that room also demands that you can’t be elsewhere. Because of this, they are only created if they are needed for some purpose. </p><p>With messaging, it’s like each person is inside of their own private room, receiving and sending paper letters at their convenience, each with little knowledge of when the other person will receive it, or their context when they receive it. This also means a lot of messaging is done passively by the user during other activities – there is no demand for exclusivity and so speed is something of an unknown… if you want to get something done fast, messaging is probably not the way. </p><figure><img src="https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/2020/07/rooms-of-social-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/rooms-of-social-1.png 600w, https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/rooms-of-social-1.png 1000w, https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/rooms-of-social-1.png 1600w, https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/2020/07/rooms-of-social-1.png 1631w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The passive nature of messaging means less demand on each party (they’re in their own space after all), but it's also less personal and involves some social friction between each batch of messages, a friction which increases directly if more time passes between batches. As that friction increases, the reason for reaching out needs to be greater and so it ends up pushing out silly, casual or free conversation for stronger reason-based messages.</p><figure><img src="https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/2020/07/social-over-time.png" alt="" srcset="https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/social-over-time.png 600w, https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/social-over-time.png 1000w, https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/2020/07/social-over-time.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>As time passes between messages</figcaption></figure><p>However, neither of these reflect the casual nature of a conversation in an office, a coworking space, or even just hanging out. In those, people are present in a space together and are ‘open’ to conversation i.e. there is a continuous ‘session' going on, even if people don’t have to actively be engaged in it. (Note: Arguably, a more awkward version of this also happens on a conference call whilst waiting for others to join, but is short-lived and more incidental.)</p><p>This open space is fertile ground for social serendipity and natural conversation, but in remote communication, there’s still something missing: a 'conversational hook'</p><h2 id="conversational-hooks"> <br>Conversational hooks</h2><p>A conversational hook is something for another to grab onto and talk about – but when the only way of interacting with another is through very intentional methods, there’s little to no <em>discovery</em> of new hooks… unless actively volunteered by someone, or perhaps something stumbles into frame (e.g. someone’s dog making a surprise appearance during a video call). </p><figure><img src="https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/2020/07/sddefault-1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/sddefault-1.jpg 600w, https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/2020/07/sddefault-1.jpg 640w"></figure><div><p><strong>What types of conversation hook are there? </strong></p><p><strong>Depth hooks </strong><br>The more you talk to someone, the more you know about them, and the more conversational hooks you have – simply put, you just know them better and so there’s more to talk about. </p><p><strong>Open channel hooks </strong><br>In a sufficiently low friction, high trust setting, people share voluntarily – they feel comfortable enough to offer these 'hooks' up. The best example of this is just hanging out together.</p><p><strong>Observed context hooks</strong> <br>If two people in a physical space bump into each other when they go to make coffee, that’s something to talk about. The same with the clothes, the weather (sorry, I’m a British cliche), the music they're playing. Our shared context powers conversation. When we aren’t able to see each other and share physical space, we have less shared context.</p></div><p>For consumers, Instagram Stories offers a neat solution by letting users offer up conversational hooks through low-stakes context sharing. Why 'low stakes'? Because stories are ephemeral, there is less pressure for the glossy presentation of a more permanent post so people can be more honest and less worried about their image. After all, the content won't last more than a day – a version of the 'open channel' we looked at earlier. This offers up a conversation starter that friends can latch onto, often spilling into a full chat.</p><p><strong>The role of proximity</strong></p><p>Real world conversation isn’t without a spatial dimension: we use proximity to control who is involved, and who is involved directly determines the type of conversation.</p><p>Conversations vary at different scales because every time we speak, we're adapting our thoughts for the audience. Whenever we speak, we’re thinking of these things:</p><ul><li>Who is the audience?</li><li>What will they think of this?</li><li>Have they understood what I’m saying?</li></ul><p>As the group gets bigger there are more people to please, and so more people to consider how they’ll receive what you’re saying. Scale directly affects how intimate a conversation is. As the number of people listening increases, a topic gets more and more diluted or the conversation becomes more and more generic.</p><p>Effectively, as the audience grows, the soapbox that a speaker at any moment is socially standing on, gets taller and the spotlight gets brighter.</p><p>This is the reason that we often take someone to one side to be able to have a more intimate conversation. Now, this is a solved problem in many social apps because they force users to rigidly define a boundary: WhatsApp groups, Slack channels etc. all have a fixed list of members OR they're totally open (like Twitter), and there's no concept of controlling the audience. </p><p>However, in a social app that offers an open space, setting rigid boundaries on a conversation isn't the natural solution – doing that would be much more equivalent to gathering people in a particular room, and so is more intent-driven. This is fine for a meeting, but the required intent also demands undivided attention during the gathering.</p><p><strong>The role of ephemerality</strong></p><p>In a normal conversation setting, things aren't quite so permanent – whatever is said is heard by the audience but not recorded forever on a server.</p><p>Just imagine two conversations in a real office: one that happens normally with someone you're sitting with, and one where there's also a camera there, recording everything. Simply making that one change to the scene, adding a sense of permanence, completely changes the dynamic. A place can be transformed from a cafe to a stage: more formal, intentional... and less natural.</p><p>Of course, there's benefits to this in the right situation (a paper trail can be useful), but to recreate the organic conversations and truly open environment that allows for social serendipity, communication needs to be able to be 'throw-away' and frivolous. </p><p>This is something that Snapchat nailed for consumer social – by making things impermanent, they are free to be more natural and real. </p>…</div></section></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>On March 30, 2020, the <a href="https://www.acm.org/articles/bulletins/2020/march/dl-access-during-covid-19">ACM announced</a> that its digital library would be open access for three months. During that time, every conference paper, journal article and book chapter published by the ACM was free to the general public. They didn’t even require a login. The reason to open the digital library was a good one: most people who use it get access through where they work, either in industry or academia. Because of the global pandemic, most people who use it are now working at home, outside of the network which allows them access.</p>
<p>I hoped it would remain open. I shared URLs to papers on the Digital Library on forums, in emails and even in source repos knowing everyone could access the papers at the moment, and hoping that would continue. I even let myself think it was likely that those making the decisions at the ACM would see that this free access had become a public good. I was wrong. On schedule, the ACM Digital Library closed again on June 30, 2020.</p>
<p>It should have remained open. First, because the global pandemic is not over, and few people who read computer science research papers are back at work. Most people who work in the software industry are still at home, and there is still uncertainty about what will happen in American colleges and universities in the next school year.</p>
<p>But more importantly, the ACM Digital Library should have remained open because the most comprehensive repository of computer science research should be freely available to all.</p>

<p>The Association for Computing Machinery, or ACM, is a non-profit professional organization for the field of computing. Its stated mission is to support “<a href="https://www.acm.org/about-acm/about-the-acm-organization">educators, researchers and professionals</a>” who work in all forms of computing. In practice, I believe the members are primarily computer science educators and researchers and the efforts of the ACM reflect that.</p>
<p>One of the most important functions of the ACM are its conferences and journals. Researchers in academia and industry publish their work through peer-reviewed conference proceedings and journals. For any given field in computer science, there is usually an ACM conference or journal which is one of the top venues to publish in for that field.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://dl.acm.org/">Digital Library</a> is the online repository for all of this research. It has papers published this month all the way back to the beginning of the field of computing in the early 1950s. It is, as far as I know, the most comprehensive single source of computer science research in the world.</p>

<p>The ACM is not a for-profit publisher. They are, as said above, a non-profit professional organization. This fact distinguishes them from for-profit publishers like Elsevier. There is a long-standing effort by many in the scientific community to <a href="http://thecostofknowledge.com/">boycott Elsevier</a> and move to open access publications. This boycott has resulted in many organizations ending contracts including <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/the-nutshell/sweden-cancels-agreement-with-elsevier-over-open-access-64405">Dutch</a>, <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-analysis/major-german-universities-cancel-elsevier-contracts-31208">German</a> and <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/the-nutshell/sweden-cancels-agreement-with-elsevier-over-open-access-64405">Swedish</a> universities, the <a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-terminates-subscriptions-worlds-largest-scientific-publisher-push-open-access-publicly">University of California</a> system and <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/guided-by-open-access-principles-mit-ends-elsevier-negotiations-0611">MIT</a>.</p>
<p>For Elsevier, this fight for open access is existential. They exist to make a profit on scientific publishing. If Elsevier can’t charge for access to the papers it has published, it has no business model and it will cease to exist. The ACM exists to serve the field of computing and society itself. The purpose of the ACM is laid out clearly in <a href="https://www.acm.org/about-acm/acm-constitution#article2">Article 2 of its constitution</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Association is an international scientific and educational organization dedicated to advancing the art, science, engineering, and application of information technology, serving both professional and public interests by fostering the open interchange of information and by promoting the highest professional and ethical standards.</p></blockquote>
<p>Opening the ACM Digital Library supports every part of that sentence.</p>
<p>My impression is that practitioners are underrepresented in the ACM. These are the professional software developers, product managers and system administrators who do the majority of the professional computing work in our industry. The ACM has on the order of <a href="https://www.acm.org/about-acm/acm-history">100,000 members</a>, which is surely a small fraction of the total computing professionals in the world.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2014/8/177024-acm-and-the-professional-programmer/fulltext">then-president Vint Cerf asked</a> why so many professionals are not members, the closed Digital Library <a href="https://www.itworld.com/article/2697033/why-many-programmers-don-t-bother-joining-the-acm.html">was one of the top answers</a>. Professional organizations exist to serve the profession and the professionals in it—even non-members. The Digital Library should not be a membership perk. It should be the public resource that inspires professionals to become members.</p>

<p>The moment you write something, you own its copyright. In order for the ACM to publish a paper, we have to <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright-and-license-forms">transfer copyright</a>. Per that agreement, authors retain the right to publish the paper on their home page (<a href="https://www.scott-a-s.com/publications">which I do</a>). The institutions the authors work at and the agencies that funded the work are also allowed to publish the paper.</p>
<p>Savvy readers without access to the Digital Library know this fact. Most recent papers can be found by simply Googling its title. Occasionally, finding a free copy of a recent paper requires tracking it down directly from authors’ homepages or institutional publication lists.</p>
<p>If most recent papers are available elsewhere, why all the fuss? There are four reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not&nbsp;<em>all</em> recent papers are posted by their authors or institutions. Authors don’t always update their home pages and institutions don’t always post papers. Some authors don’t even have a home page.</li>
<li>Older papers, from before authors routinely had a home page, are not freely available anywhere.</li>
<li>The Digital Library URL for a paper should be the canonical online home for that paper. If the author does not have a home page or the institution they work for ceases to exist, that URL will always be valid. But people are less likely to share that URL if not everyone can access it. Rather, they will point to the versions scattered throughout the internet.</li>
<li>The Digital Library itself is valuable: it is a well-designed network of papers, authors, conferences and journals. If you find an interesting paper, you can then easily look at the other papers published in the same conference. Or other papers published by the same author.</li>
</ol>

<p>Rationally, three months of open access is better than zero, so the current situation is better than before. Yet, instead of giving the ACM credit for those three months, I’m asking for more. I acknowledge that is unfair. I also acknowledge that the ACM has <a href="https://libraries.acm.org/subscriptions-access/acmopen">stated that their eventual goal</a> is general open access. They have several efforts towards this goal: ACM conferences can choose to <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/permanent-access">grant open access</a> to their latest proceedings; authors can <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/openaccess#hybrid">pay a fixed fee</a> for their paper to be open; and they established entire journals where all articles <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/openaccess#gold">must pay the fixed fee</a> to be open.</p>
<p>This is progress, and we must grant credit for incremental improvements. But I fear the ACM is still being too conservative: these efforts are ad-hoc, do not apply to historical papers and do not seem to make open access the primary goal.</p>
<p>I freely admit that I do not know what a sustainable model would look like. But I do know it is possible. While they are smaller in scope, there are major computer science conferences and journals that are completely open access, such as <a href="https://www.usenix.org/">USENIX</a> and <a href="https://vldb.org/">VLDB</a>.</p>
<p>I am a member of the ACM, and I intend to be a member for the rest of my life. I criticize it not because it is bad, but because I believe it is good. I just want it to be better.</p>

        <p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/theautomatic.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/python-for-else-statement.jpg?w=640" alt="python for else statement" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>



<p>One of the first things you usually learn when starting a new language is the if-else construct of that language.  <a href="http://theautomatic.net/category/python/">Python</a>, like some other languages, offers an extended variation of this called the “for/else” statement.  Let’s check out a couple examples to see how it works!</p>
<h2><strong>The for/else statement</strong></h2>
<p>The main use case for the for/else statement is when you need to loop through a list with the potential to break out of the loop.  If a break occurs in the loop, the code within the <strong>else</strong> clause will <em>not</em> be executed.  However, if a break does <em>not</em> occur, then the code within the <strong>else</strong> clause <em>will</em> be executed.</p>
<p>For example, in the code below we initialize test = False.  Then we loop through each element in the list, <em>nums</em>.  If an element in <em>nums</em> equals 20, we break out of the loop.  Since no element equals 20,  we never break out of the loop, and therefore, the <strong>else</strong> clause is executed, which changes the value of test to equal True.</p>
<pre title="">

nums = [10, 4, 6, 8, 2]
test = False
for num in nums:
    if num == 20:
        break
else:
    test = True


</pre>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/theautomatic.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/python-search-list.png?w=640" alt="python search list for else statement" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>In general, rather than just flagging a variable as True / False, you might want to perform some additional actions based off whether the break occurred.</p>
<pre title="">
nums = [10, 4, 6, 8, 2]
test = False
for num in nums:
    if num == 20:
        # do something here if 20 is found...
        break
else:
    test = True
    # do additional code here in case 20 is never found...

</pre>
<h2><strong>while/else statements</strong></h2>
<p>In addition to for/else statements, <a href="http://theautomatic.net/category/python/">Python</a> also supports while/else statements.  We can modify our code above to use a while/else statement like this:</p>
<pre title="">
nums = [10, 4, 6, 8, 2]
test = False
i = 0
while i in range(len(nums)):
    if nums[i] == 20:
        break

<p>There’s a certain set of special method signatures in C# which have particular support on the language level.
Methods with those signatures allow for using a special syntax which has several benefits. For example, we can use them to simplify our code or create <code>DSL</code> to express a solution to our domain-specific problem in a much cleaner way. I came across those methods in different places, so I decided to create a blog post to summarize all my discoveries on this subject.</p>

<h2 id="collection-initialization-syntax">Collection initialization syntax<a href="#collection-initialization-syntax" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a> </h2>

<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/object-and-collection-initializers#collection-initializers">Collection initializer</a> is a quite old feature, as it exists in the language since version 3 (released in late 2007). Just as a reminder, <code>Collection initializer</code> allows for pre-populating a list by providing elements inside the block statement:</p>

<pre><code>var list = new List&lt;int&gt; { 1, 2, 3};
</code></pre>

<p>This translates simply to the following list of statements:</p>

<pre><code>var list = new List&lt;int&gt;();
list.Add(1);
list.Add(2);
list.Add(3);
</code></pre>

<p><code>Collection initializer</code> is not characteristic only for arrays and collection types from <code>BCL</code> but can be used with any type meeting the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Implements <code>IEnumerable</code> interface</li>
<li>Declares method with <code>void Add(T item)</code> signature</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>public class CustomList&lt;T&gt;: IEnumerable
{
    public IEnumerator GetEnumerator() =&gt; throw new NotImplementedException();
    public void Add(T item) =&gt; throw new NotImplementedException();
}
</code></pre>

<p>We can add support for <code>Collection initializer</code> to existing types by defining the <code>Add</code> method as an extension method:</p>

<pre><code>public static class ExistingTypeExtensions
{
    public static void Add&lt;T&gt;(ExistingType @this, T item) =&gt; throw new NotImplementedException();
}
</code></pre>

<p>This syntax can be also used to insert elements into the collection field without accessible setter in initialization block:</p>

<pre><code>class CustomType
{
    public List&lt;string&gt; CollectionField { get; private set; }  = new List&lt;string&gt;();
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var obj = new CustomType
        {
            CollectionField = 
            {
                "item1",
                "item2"
            }
        };
    }
}

</code></pre>

<p><code>Add</code> method can have more than one parameter:</p>

<pre><code>public class CustomList&lt;T&gt;: IEnumerable
{
    public IEnumerator GetEnumerator() =&gt; throw new NotImplementedException();
    public void Add(T item, string extraParam1, int extraParam1) =&gt; throw new NotImplementedException();
}
</code></pre>

<p>To use this overload inside the initialization block we need to wrap all parameters in extra pair of curly braces:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = new CustomType
{
    CollectionField = 
    {
        {"item1", "extraParamVal1", 2 },
        {"item2", "extraParamVal2", 3 }
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p><code>Collection initializer</code> is quite often used to initialize collection with a well known number of items, but we can utilize it to set up collection with a dynamic number of elements. In both cases the syntax is identical:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = new CustomType
{
    CollectionField = 
    {
       existingItems
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>This is possible for types which meet the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Implements <code>IEnumerable</code> interface</li>
<li>Declares method with <code>void Add(IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; items)</code> signature</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>public class CustomList&lt;T&gt;: IEnumerable
{
    public IEnumerator GetEnumerator() =&gt; throw new NotImplementedException();
    public void Add(IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; items) =&gt; throw new NotImplementedException();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, array type and collections from <code>BCL</code> don’t implement <code>void Add(IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; items)</code> method, but we could easily change that by defining an extension method for the existing collection types:</p>

<pre><code>public static class ListExtensions
{
    public static void Add&lt;T&gt;(this List&lt;T&gt; @this, IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; items) =&gt; @this.AddRange(items);
}

</code></pre>

<p>Thanks to this extension method it’s now possible to write code which looks as follows:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = new CustomType
{
    CollectionField = 
    {
        existingItems.Where(x =&gt; /*Filter items*/) .Select(x =&gt; /*Map items*/) 
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>or even compose the resulting collection from the mix of individual elements and results of multiple <code>enumerables</code>:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = new CustomType
{
    CollectionField = 
    {
        individualElement1,
        individualElement2,
        list1.Where(x =&gt; /*Filter items*/) .Select(x =&gt; /*Map items*/),
        list2.Where(x =&gt; /*Filter items*/) .Select(x =&gt; /*Map items*/),
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>Without this syntax, it would be very hard to achieve a similar result inside the initialization block.</p>

<p>I’ve discovered this language feature by accident while working with mappings for types with collection fields generated from <code>protobuf</code> contracts. For those of you who are not familiar with <code>protobuf</code>, if you are using <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp-generated">grpctools</a> to generate dotnet types from <code>proto</code> files, all collection fields are generated as follows:</p>

<pre><code>[DebuggerNonUserCode]
public RepeatableField&lt;ItemType&gt; SomeCollectionField
{
    get
    {
        return this.someCollectionField_;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, collection fields in generated code don’t have a setter, but a blessing in disguise, <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/collections/repeated-field-t-">RepeatableField<t></t></a> implements <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/collections/repeated-field-t-#class_google_1_1_protobuf_1_1_collections_1_1_repeated_field_3_01_t_01_4_1a6d0e9efbac818182068afae48b8d4599">void Add(IEnumerable<t> items)</t></a> so we can still initialize them inside the initialization block:</p>

<pre><code>/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Adds all of the specified values into this collection. This method is present to
/// allow repeated fields to be constructed from queries within collection initializers.
/// Within non-collection-initializer code, consider using the equivalent &lt;see cref="AddRange"/&gt;
/// method instead for clarity.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name="values"&gt;The values to add to this collection.&lt;/param&gt;
public void Add(IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; values)
{
    AddRange(values);
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="dictionary-initialization-syntax">Dictionary initialization syntax<a href="#dictionary-initialization-syntax" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a> </h2>

<p>One of the cool features introduced in C# 6 was <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-6#initialize-associative-collections-using-indexers">Index initializers</a> which simplified syntax for dictionary initialization. Thanks to that we can write dictionary init code in a much more readable way:</p>

<pre><code>var errorCodes = new Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt;
{
    [404] = "Page not Found",
    [302] = "Page moved, but left a forwarding address.",
    [500] = "The web server can't come out to play today."
};
</code></pre>

<p>This code is translated to:</p>

<pre><code>var errorCodes = new Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt;();
errorCodes[404] = "Page not Found";    
errorCodes[302] = "Page moved, but left a forwarding address.";    
errorCodes[500] = "The web server can't come out to play today.";    
</code></pre>

<p>It’s not much but it definitely results with a better experience for writing and reading the code.</p>

<p>The best thing about <code>Index initializer</code> is that it is not limited only to <code>Dictionary&lt;&gt;</code> class, it can be used with any type which defines an <code>indexer</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class HttpHeaders
{
    public string this[string key]
    {
        get =&gt; throw new NotImplementedException();
        set =&gt; throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var headers = new HttpHeaders
        {
            ["access-control-allow-origin"] = "*",
            ["cache-control"] = "max-age=315360000, public, immutable"
        };
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="deconstructors">Deconstructors<a href="#deconstructors" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a> </h2>

<p>In C# 7.0, together with tuples, a deconstructor mechanism has been introduced. Deconstructors allow for “decomposing” a tuple into a set of individual variables as follows:</p>

<pre><code>var point = (5, 7);
// decomposing tuple into separated variables
var (x, y) = point;
</code></pre>

<p>which is equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>ValueTuple&lt;int, int&gt; point = new ValueTuple&lt;int, int&gt;(1, 4);
int x = point.Item1;
int y = point.Item2;
</code></pre>

<p>This syntax allows also for switching values of two variables without the need for an explicit declaration of the third variable:</p>

<pre><code>int x = 5, y = 7;
//switch
(x, y) = (y,x);
</code></pre>

<p>… or for a more succinct way of member initialization:</p>

<pre><code>class Point
{
    public int X { get; }
    public int Y { get; }

    public Point(int x, int y)  =&gt; (X, Y) = (x, y);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Deconstructors can be used not only with tuples but with custom types too. To allow for deconstructing custom type, it needs to implement a method that obeys the following rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>It’s named <code>Deconstruct</code></li>
<li>Returns void</li>
<li>Every parameter has to be defined with <code>out</code> modifier</li>
</ul>

<p>For our type <code>Point</code> we can define deconstructor in the following way:</p>

<pre><code>class Point
{
    public int X {get;}
    public int Y {get;}

    public Point(int x, int y) =&gt; (X, Y) = (x, y);
    
    public void Deconstruct(out int x, out int y) =&gt; (x, y) = (X, Y);
}
</code></pre>

<p>and sample usage can look as follows:</p>

<pre><code>var point = new Point(2,4);
var (x, y)= point;        
</code></pre>

<p>which under the hood is translated to:</p>

<pre><code>int x;
int y;
new Point(2, 4).Deconstruct(out x, out y);
</code></pre>

<p>Deconstructors can be added to types declared outside the source code by defining them as an extension method:</p>

<pre><code>public static class PointExtensions
{
     public static void Deconstruct(this Point @this, out int x, out int y) =&gt; (x, y) = (@this.X, @this.Y);
}
</code></pre>

<p>One of the most useful examples of deconstructors is the one for <code>KeyValuePair&lt;TKey,TValue&gt;</code>, which allows for easy access to key and value while iterating over a dictionary:</p>

<pre><code>foreach(var (key, value) in new Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt; { [1] = "val1", [2] = "val2" })
{
    //TODO: Do something
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>KeyValuePair&lt;TKey,TValue&gt;.Deconstruct(TKey, TValue)</code> is available only from <code>netstandard2.1</code>. For previous <code>netstandard</code> versions we need to add it manually using the approach with the extension method.</p>

<h2 id="custom-awaitable-types">Custom awaitable types<a href="#custom-awaitable-types" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a> </h2>

<p>C# 5 (released together with Visual Studio 2012) introduced an <code>async/await</code> mechanism which was a real game-changer in the area of asynchronous programming. Before that, handling invocation of asynchronous methods resulted very often in quite a messy code, especially when there was more than one asynchronous invocation:</p>

<pre><code>void DoSomething()
{
    DoSomethingAsync().ContinueWith((task1) =&gt; {
        if (task1.IsCompletedSuccessfully)
        {
            DoSomethingElse1Async(task1.Result).ContinueWith((task2) =&gt; {
                if (task2.IsCompletedSuccessfully)
                {
                    DoSomethingElse2Async(task2.Result).ContinueWith((task3) =&gt; {
                        //TODO: Do something
                    });
                }
            });
 …</code></pre></article></div>

<p>Looking for a cloud hosted Maven repository when working with Google Cloud? Sign up for a free 14-day trial of <a href="https://www.deps.co/">Deps Private Maven Repositories</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Deps is a private, hosted, Maven repository. While building it I had a critical decision to make - Where to host it? I evaluated many different hosting services but decided on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). I’ve been using it in pre-production and then production for over a year and a half now. I haven’t seen too many experience reports on Google Cloud, so I wanted to share how I’ve found it, what went well, and what still needs improving. I’ve split my thoughts below into good, meh, bad, ugly, and opportunities for improvement. I have compared and contrasted with Amazon Web Services (AWS), the other hosting provider that I have the most experience with, and GCP’s biggest competitor.</p>

<p>A note up front, these are solely my experiences, and it’s quite possible that I’ve misunderstood or misrepresented things here. If I’ve made any mistakes, let me know so I can correct them. I only talk about services that I have experience using. There are a bunch of really good looking services like Google Kubernetes Engine, Google App Engine, and BigQuery, but I haven’t used them enough (or at all) to be able to give a review on them.</p>

<h2 id="permissions">Permissions</h2>

<p>Google Cloud’s permission model is one of its strongest features. AWS IAM permissions are fairly complicated; in practice people often set permissions to <code>s3:*</code> or equivalent to make things work. For this reason (and others) there has become a ‘best-practice’ of running multiple AWS accounts for dev, staging, and prod, and <a href="https://segment.com/blog/secure-access-to-100-aws-accounts/">maybe more environments</a>. AWS seems to be okay with this situation and is leaning into it, offering <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/06/introducing-aws-landing-zone/">AWS Landing Zone</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/">Organisations</a> to help orchestrate multiple accounts. This works, but it seems like it adds a lot of complexity.</p>

<p>In contrast, GCP offers a much simpler starting point: Projects. Every resource you create (I think?) lives in a Project, and Projects live inside your (single) Organisation. By default, resources within a Project are accessible to other resources in that Project (as long as their API is enabled) and are inaccessible to anything outside of the project. For example, if you create a Cloud SQL database and a Cloud Storage bucket, by default a VM inside the project can access both resources, but a VM outside of the project couldn’t. This goes a long way towards setting up safe permission structures. If you need to, you can setup inter-project resource access, but it’s not something you’re likely to need too much. In my experience, I needed it for accessing disk images and DNS records, but everything else for Deps’ production service lives isolated in the production project.</p>

<p>Google’s Organisation management offers <a href="https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-folders">hierarchical folders</a> with cascading permissions. I haven’t needed to use them, but it seems like this would scale well to very large organisations. I wonder if this is modelled on the way Google’s internal permission system works?</p>

<h2 id="product-philosophy">Product Philosophy</h2>

<p>GCP has quite a different product philosophy to AWS. When new GCP features and resources are released into general availability, they are usually very high quality. This is in contrast to AWS where it can sometimes feel like you are the first person to use a feature. A quote I have seen which rings true to me is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17025561">“Google’s Beta is like AWS’s GA”</a>.</p>

<p>GCP also has done well with integrating their different services together. GCP provides a smaller set of core primitives that are global and work well for lots of use cases. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/">Pub/Sub</a> is probably the best example I have for this. In AWS you have SQS, SNS, Amazon MQ, Kinesis Data Streams, Kinesis Data Firehose, DynamoDB Streams, and maybe another queueing service by the time you read this post. <strong>2019 Update</strong>: Amazon has now released another streaming service: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/msk/">Amazon Managed Streaming Kafka</a>. GCP has Pub/Sub. Pub/Sub seems flexible enough to replace most (all?) of AWS’ various queues. (Disclaimer, I haven’t used Pub/Sub yet, just looked at its documentation).</p>

<p>Google opts for strong consistency by default. Google Cloud Storage, has <a href="https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2018/02/how-Google-Cloud-Storage-offers-strongly-consistent-object-listing-thanks-to-Spanner.html">consistent</a> lists and gets, Cloud Key Management Service has strong (global) consistent key enablement, and Cloud Spanner is their globe-spanning consistent database. Many AWS services are eventually consistent, which pushes complexity onto the developer.</p>

<p>Even though Google has a smaller set of primitives than AWS, they are often simpler. Rather than having dozens of compute instance types, they offer just four: micro, standard, highmem, and highcpu. In actual fact, these are all just pre-configurations in the design space, and you can size and configure your instances to be just about any combination of memory and CPU.</p>

<p>Another small thing, but one that I appreciated is that GCP’s resource names are often aesthetically prettier. Either you get to name resources yourself (I’m looking at you <code>jfkjfkfjlkjfjfkak.cloudfront.net</code>), or the generated names are short, e.g. <code>&lt;instance-prefix&gt;-cjgh</code>.</p>

<h2 id="global-and-regional-by-default">Global and Regional by default</h2>

<p>One of the nicest things about GCP is that most resources are either global or regional. This includes things like the control panel (you can see all of your project’s VMs on a single screen), disk images, storage buckets (multi-region within a continent), network configuration, global load balancing, Pub/Sub, VPC networks, and probably more I’m forgetting. This contrasts with AWS, where most resources, including the control panel, are either zonal or regional.</p>

<h2 id="compute-engine">Compute Engine</h2>

<p>Google Compute Engine has been very solid for me. I’m only using it for a handful of VMs but I haven’t noticed any issues with it. The instance group managers work well and auto-scaling does what it’s meant to do. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/health-checks">Health checks</a> can be used to destroy unhealthy instances and create new ones without manual intervention (this has pros and cons, as you may lose debugging information). <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups/updating-managed-instance-groups">Rolling updates</a> work well for doing deployments. The Rolling Update manager waits for new instances to be healthy before shutting down old instances. This has helped catch a few issues before they hit production. If your instance is unhealthy, GCP provides <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/live-migration">live instance migration</a>. It’s nice, it seems to happen once/twice a week, and I’ve never noticed any issues with it. On AWS, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/maintenance-help/">maintenance events</a> will require a reboot.</p>

<p>Google’s pricing model is much simpler. As mentioned above, you can preconfigure your machines to just about any combination of memory and CPU that makes sense for your application. You can also pick your Intel CPU instance family if you need certain CPU features, or just want the slight performance boost available.</p>

<p>For standard VMs, Google offers <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/sustained-use-discounts">Sustained Use Discounts</a>. If you run a standard VM for more than 25% of a month, Compute Engine automatically discounts your bill. If you run an instance for a full month this ends up to be a 30% discount. This is a nice benefit if you don’t want to pre-purchase capacity, but still have a stable workload. They even do something neat with ‘inferred instances’ where they bin-pack partial instance usage. This means you don’t lose your discount if you replace instances through the month, and ends up giving you the maximum possible discount. I can’t do it justice here, check out the docs, it’s really cool.</p>

<p>Google’s answer to AWS spot pricing is <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/preemptible">Preemptible Instances</a>. Instead of bidding on instances and working out the maximum price you’re willing to pay, they offer a single, fixed 80% discount. One thing that is trickier with Preemptible Instances is that you only get a 30-second warning before your instance is preempted. On AWS you get two minutes. The tradeoff is that both pre-emptible and standard instance startup times are faster because Google can evict Preemptible Instances more quickly. On AWS, after submitting a spot request you may have to wait a short time before your spot request is fulfilled.</p>

<p>Lastly, Google has an answer to Amazon’s Reserved Instances, and again they are much simpler. To use <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/signing-up-committed-use-discounts">Committed Use Discounts</a>, you purchase vCPUs and memory capacity separately. Your purchase is tied to a region but is otherwise convertible to just about any instance configuration (see the docs for a few small limitations). Committed Use Discounts are automatically applied to the instances you are running in your workload, and then Sustained Use Discounts are applied to any resource usage on top of that.</p>

<h2 id="terraform">Terraform</h2>

<p>Picking Terraform has been a really big win for Deps. It enables us to quickly and safely spin up a complete staging or development environment to test a risky infrastructure change. It also ensures that changes to production are tracked, commented, and coherent as a whole. Terraform takes a little bit of learning, but the <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/index.html">Google Cloud Provider docs</a> are really good, and the team working on the provider is constantly updating it with new features and resources in GCP. If you want to be on the bleeding edge of every GCP feature then Terraform may not be a good fit for you, as they don’t generally support beta resources. However you could manage those beta resources via the console/CLI/<a href="https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/">Deployment Manager</a> until Terraform support is added, then <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/index.html">import</a> them into your Terraform config.</p>

<p>The one place I think Terraform has room to improve is in running multiple environments from a single configuration, e.g. dev, staging, prod. <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/workspaces.html">Workspaces</a> are good, but there is limited support for switching variables based on your workspace.</p>

                    <div><div><div><p>
	The decision to shut down eight nuclear reactors in the year following the Fukushima disaster contributed to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/418078/electricity-prices-for-households-in-germany/">higher electricity prices</a> in Germany. It also led to the partial replacement of nuclear generation by electricity generated from coal, lignite and gas, and thus to an increase in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and local pollution, the health effects of which have not been considered.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Diffuse and concentrated risks</b>
</p>
<p>
	The dispersal of risks and accidents is a factor that facilitates their social acceptance. Thus, although much less deadly than road accidents (which cause more than <a href="https://www.preventionroutiere.asso.fr/2019/12/22/statistiques-daccidents/">3,000 deaths</a> a year in France), plane and train accidents cause more emotion. Even if we add to this the 20,000 or so injured people hospitalized each year as a result of road accidents, the car is perceived as not very dangerous, and public opinion erupts when the authorities seek to impose speed limits. In the evaluation of public policies, this difference in perception is generally not considered. At best, economists calculate the balance of aggregate benefits and costs without taking into account how these benefits and costs are felt by the public. Politicians, on the contrary, if only for electoral reasons, are more sensitive to the concentration or dispersion in time and space of the effects of their decisions.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Phasing out nuclear power</b>
</p>
<p>
	Germany's nuclear power plant policy is an example of this sprinkling effect. In 2011, after the meltdown of the Fukushima Daiichi reactors, the German government, which had just relaunched the industry, decided to gradually close all its nuclear power plants. The last ones will have to stop in 2022. No cost-benefit assessment was carried out to support this decision, but the federal authorities considered that it would be well accepted by the population, which has often shown its hostility to this technology because of the risks of accidents and the problem of waste reprocessing. Even today, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00148-015-0558-8">81% of Germans are still in favor</a> of this radical change of policy. For <a href="https://www.greenpeace.fr/la-sortie-du-nucleaire-en-allemagne-a-t-elle-ete-compensee-par-une-hausse-de-la-production-de-charbon/">environmental organizations</a>, the move away from nuclear power is a win-win situation, as plant closures are compensated for by the production of electricity from renewable sources, which is operated at close to zero cost and without emitting greenhouse gas or particulates. It is undeniable that green electricity production has <a href="https://www.energy-charts.de/ren_share.htm?year=all&amp;source=ren-share&amp;period=annual">sharply increased</a> over the decade. But in an industry where the product is not storable on a large scale, it is necessary to ensure that production is available at the times when consumers want to use it. Because wind and sun are intermittent, unless considerable capital is invested in energy storage facilities, green energy cannot be an identical replacement for dispatchable plants that operate at baseload levels and, if necessary, increase their output to meet peak demands. The problem arises in particular at the end of the day when demand increases while the photovoltaic panels are not producing. At times when green energy is not available, conventional German thermal power plants, or imports, have had to be used to replace closed nuclear power plants. The shutdown of the reactors has therefore been accompanied by an increase in production from green energy at times when it is available and, at times when it is not, by an increase in production from power stations burning coal, lignite and gas, as well as by an increase in imports, especially from Denmark, France and the Czech Republic.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Generalized cost</b>
</p>
<p>
	In total, output from thermal power stations has fallen, but to a lesser extent than if the nuclear power stations had not been shut down. A <a href="https://haas.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/WP304.pdf">study</a> conducted at Berkeley measures the difference between the observed trajectory and that of the alternative scenario in which the nuclear reactors would not have been shut down early (the counterfactual). It assesses the costs associated with the more intensive use of conventional thermal power plants and the increased imports resulting from the nuclear phase-out. The authors analyze the shutdown of 10 reactors (out of the 17 initially operating) between 2011 and 2017. The originality of the study is that it is not limited to production costs and aggregate carbon emissions. It also integrates the spatial dispersion of effects in terms of local air pollution. By combining data on hourly and plant by plant operating volumes and costs between 2010 and 2017 with information on electricity demand and prices, local weather conditions and primary energy prices, the authors calculate what the hourly output per plant would have been if the government had not ordered the closure of the ten reactors. They deduce the additional costs incurred in terms of primary energy consumption and environmental damage. They end up with some estimates of the effect of the closure decision on the average production of thermal power plants (+15%), on imports (+37%) and on wholesale prices (+4%). As the four major industrial groups owning nuclear power plants also owned coal-fired power plants, they were little penalized by this energy substitution. However, the higher prices were indeed a cost for German consumers, estimated by the authors at $1.6 billion per year. But this is not the main cost. The impact on health and the climate must also be considered.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	<b>Local pollution and excess mortality</b>
</p>
<p>
	The combustion of fossil fuels causes emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> and pollutants with local health effects (SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub> and fine particles). According to the study cited, the replacement of nuclear power plant production resulted in an additional 12% for each of these emissions. The additional carbon dioxide emissions amount to 36 million tons per year, which, based on a social cost of carbon of $50/tCO<sub>2</sub>, represents an additional cost of $1.8 billion per year.
</p>
<p>
	But the most important effect comes from additional local pollution: it would have caused an excess mortality of 1,100 individuals per year. This number is calculated from a geographical analysis of the populations living around the thermal power plants, the variation in local production induced by the government decision and estimates of the harmfulness of local pollution (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24332274">ESCAPE project</a>). It only considers residents in Germany, without integrating the effects in neighboring countries. Taking a value of $7.9 million as the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318790641_Income_Elasticities_and_Global_Values_of_a_Statistical_Life/fulltext/597f45b6aca272d568188301/Income-Elasticities-and-Global-Values-of-a-Statistical-Life.pdf">price of a German's life</a>, the authors of the study estimate that the additional cost of the closure decision due to local pollution amounts to $8.7 billion per year.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Benefits of closure</b>
</p>
<p>
	The costs are therefore substantial. What about the benefits? By closing the country's nuclear power plants, the German government wants to eliminate the risk of accidents and solve the problem of waste treatment and storage. The evaluation of the induced gain depends on the accident probabilities retained and on the way in which the <a href="https://www.liberation.fr/checknews/2019/04/20/est-il-vrai-que-l-accident-nucleaire-de-fukushima-n-a-cause-aucun-mort_1720075">populations</a> in the vicinity of the damaged plants are taken care of (evacuation, re-housing, care, etc.). Current estimates are around <a href="https://www.mech.kuleuven.be/en/tme/research/energy_environment/Pdf/wpen2013-14.pdf">$3 per MWh</a>. As the exit policy has resulted in a reduction of 53 TWh/year in nuclear generation, the estimated gain is less than $200 million per year, far from the annual cost of $12 billion resulting from the addition of the additional cost of production ($1.6M), the additional CO2 emissions ($1.8M) and the additional mortality linked to local emissions ($8.7M).
</p>
<p>
	*
</p>
<p>
	*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *
</p>

<p>
	Assessing the economic and environmental impact of a nuclear power plant is not easy. It requires approximate assumptions that are open to criticism. But even if one can think that the costs are overestimated and the gains underestimated by the study cited above, the gap between the two is so great that it is difficult to see how the decision to close could be justified on a purely techno-economic level. However, in hindsight, even in possession of these data, it is likely that the anxiety-producing potential of the images of the earthquake/tsunami/reactors-meltdown sequence looping through the 24-hour news channels would have led the German government to take the same decision. The scattering of illnesses and deaths caused by local pollution considerably reduces their weight in the face of an event such as Fukushima, where we find the ingredients of the classic tragedy: unity of place, unity of time and unity of action. It is a psychological fact that explains why political rationality often frees itself from economic and environmental analysis.

      <p>
        It happened.
      </p>
      <p>
        The email every app developer dreads:
      </p>
      <p><img src="https://directmemo.io/images/blog/1/rejection-e2a3c6a88dbf773961f19d543c955055.png?vsn=d" alt=""></p><p>
        I had done everything right:
      </p>
      <p>
        -- I tackled a problem I had from my 5 years of working remotely: <span>the difficulty of privately sharing team-wide tasks, announcements, and reminders.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        -- I found my first customer on Twitter before writing a line of code.
      </p>
      <p>
        -- I even shipped quickly and iterated.
      </p>
      <p><img src="https://directmemo.io/images/blog/1/tweet-1c7e0b96d0e0d70d03aa4b661afb9531.png?vsn=d" alt=""></p><p>
        I checked all the boxes they teach you in Startup School!
      </p>
      <p>
        I tried to reason with them, or get some direction on how to get approval:

        No dice.
      </p>
      <p>Time to get scrappy.</p>
      <p>In a moment of brash inspiration, I tweeted at Stewart Butterfield (Slack's CEO) basically pleading my case</p>
      <p>No response.</p>
      <p>Sidenote: I deleted that tweet, but Stewart - if you’re reading this, give me a 5-minute chat any time, any place!</p>
      <p>My next move was to scour Twitter for phrases related to “Slack team tasks”, “Slack mass-messaging”, etc. and reach out directly to as many people as possible.</p>
      <p><img src="https://directmemo.io/images/blog/1/tweet2-9e15582f560fc65c73ec2c8461ff9e5a.png?vsn=d" alt=""></p><p>I ended up finding a 2-year-old tweet by Ryan Hoover (Founder of Product Hunt) about a browser plugin that served a similar purpose, but not very well.</p>
      <p>To get his attention, I posted the app to Product Hunt, and asked him for feedback as a reply to his original tweet:</p>
      <p><img src="https://directmemo.io/images/blog/1/hoover-fa7a1492ebc3de3e203a5b3f80d7cac7.png?vsn=d" alt=""></p><p>No response, again :/</p>
      <p>Next I created <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/direct-memo" target="_blank">an Indie Hackers profile</a> with a post linking to the Product Hunt page, which led to a good number of upvotes.</p>
      <p>Sidenote: I’ve found the IndieHacker community to be one of the most supportive and welcoming on the internet - a testament to the leadership team and Rosie Sherry, the community manager. If you’re interested in community building, <a href="https://rosieland.substack.com/" target="_blank">her newsletter</a> is a must-read.</p>
      <p>Upvotes trickled in, until something awesome and unexpected happened. Ryan upvoted my post!</p>
      <p><img src="https://directmemo.io/images/blog/1/upvote-5751a7e7165c8c5e0cb3245eda22e5bb.png?vsn=d" alt=""></p><p>Obviously, app signups surged.</p>
      <p>Users signed up from large corporations, small businesses, universities, and everything in between.</p>
      <p>Industries ranged from watch-makers to fantasy sports commissioners, to CEOs.</p>
      <p>The thrill was intoxicating, and it hasn’t died down. A month later I still jump out of bed to check on new signups every morning!</p>
      <p>Moral of the story: When things don't go as planned, get scrappy and put yourself in a position to get lucky.</p>
      <p>Next I’ll be experimenting with other ways to grow, like social media ads. Are there any courses or websites you recommend for learning how to do them well?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>C++17 introduced <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/new/operator_new">an alignment argument</a> to <code>::operator new()</code>. It's important to note that if you allocate something using aligned new, you <strong>absolutely must</strong> deallocate it <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/delete">using aligned delete</a>, or the behavior is undefined. LLVM 10.x takes advantage of this alignment parameter, if the compiler supports it. That means if you are compiling on Windows with MSVC set to C++14, <code>__cpp_aligned_new</code> is not defined and the extra argument isn't passed. Otherwise, if it's compiled with MSVC set to C++17, <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/User:D41D8CD98F/feature_testing_macros"><code>__cpp_aligned_new</code> is defined</a> and the extra argument is passed.</p><p>There's just one teeny tiny little problem - <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/6d2f73f821ed5ea584869924b150ac2e6e65c12e/llvm/include/llvm/Support/Compiler.h#L568">the check was in a header file</a>.</p><p>Now, if this header file were completely internal and LLVM itself only ever called <code>::operator new()</code> from inside it's libraries, this wouldn't be a problem. As you might have guessed, this was not the case. LLVM was calling <code>allocate_buffer()</code> from inside header files. The corresponding <code>deallocate_buffer</code> call <em>was</em> inside the same header file, but sadly, it was called from a destructor, and <em>that</em> destructor had been called from inside one of LLVM's libraries, which meant it didn't know about aligned allocations… <strong>Oops!</strong></p><p>This means, if your program uses C++17, but LLVM was compiled with C++14, your program will happily pass LLVM <strong>aligned memory</strong>, which LLVM will then pass into <strong>the wrong delete operator</strong>, because it's calling the unaligned delete function from C++14 instead of the aligned delete function from C++17. This results in strange and bizarre heap corruption errors because of the mismatched <code>::operator new</code> and <code>::operator delete</code>. Arguably, the real bug here is LLVM calling any allocation function from a header file in the first place, as this is just begging for ABI problems.</p><p>Of course, one might ask why a C++17 application would be linking against LLVM compiled with C++14. Well, you see, the <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-10.0.0">prebuilt LLVM binaries</a> were compiled against C++14… <strong>OOPS!</strong> Suddenly if you wanted to avoid compiling LLVM yourself, you couldn't use C++17 anymore!</p><p>Luckily <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/7aaff8fd2da2812a2b3cbc8a41af29774b10a7d6"><strong>this has now been fixed</strong></a> after a bunch of people complained about the extremely unintuitive errors resulting from this mismatch. Unfortunately, as of this writing, <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/">LLVM still hasn't provided a new release</a>, which means you will still encounter this problem using the latest precompiled binaries of LLVM. Personally, I recompile LLVM using C++17 for my own projects, just to be safe, since LLVM does not gaurantee ABI compatibility in these situations.</p><p>Still, this is a particularly nasty case of an unintentional ABI break between C++ versions, which is easy to miss because most people assume C++ versions are backwards compatible. Be careful, and stop allocating memory in header files that might be deallocated inside your library!</p></div></div>]]>

It’s an important characteristic of successful tech companies, so investors often ask about it when you try to raise money.</p><p>Defensibility questions sound like <em>‘once you’re big, how will you stay big?’</em>, <em>‘once you’re&nbsp;winning, how will you keep winning?’</em>, or the slightly misleading <em>‘what stops other people doing this?’</em>.</p><p>Founders tend to think a good answer might be <em>‘what we do is hard to do’</em>. They mix hard with defensible. But hard is not defensible.</p><p>Why? There are two kinds of hardness: Math hard – the hardness of working something out; and Bodybuilding hard – the intrinsic hardness of doing certain things. Both can buy you time, but are never enough.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-70effda3d90febe5484b"><div><p>Working new things out is hard, but that doesn’t mean once something has been worked out it’s hard to do. Things that are hard to come up with but easy to copy are ‘Math hard'.</p><p>Many mathematics problems take a long time to figure out how to solve. But, once you have a method, often the answer can be verified quickly and the method can be learned easily. Pythagoras needed to be smart to invent his theorem, but now children learn it in school. Other Math Hard things include recipes, designs, and new ideas.</p><p>Unless Pythagoras could have kept his method a secret, which is difficult to do, his theorem wouldn’t have helped him build a defensible company. Even school kids can copy it.</p><p>This is like startup ideas for a new kind of user experience or interface – they’re hard to figure out, hard to keep secret (especially if your users experience the secret), and easy to copy.</p><p>But what if you could keep the secret? After all, ‘trade secrets’ can be kept for a while if you’re careful.</p><p>The problem is, the more success you have with your secret, the more effort other people will put in to discover it. You might be really smart, and have worked really hard, but there are lots of smart people who will work hard to be successful. It’s unrealistic to think that you’ll ever have a totally unique insight, let alone one other people couldn’t come up with if they really wanted to.</p><p>If this kind of insight were the defensibility criterion necessary for starting a successful company, by definition almost no-one would ever start one. No matter the ingenuity of your invention, you’re going to end up competing on some other dimension.</p><p>Math Hardness, the hardness of working stuff out, at best buys you time. How much time? Sadly, some amount of time that’s inversely proportional to how much success you’re having. The more valuable your secret turns out to be, the less time you have left.</p><p>The other kind of hardness is the intrinsic hardness of doing certain things. Some things are difficult to do, even if everyone knows how to do them. This is Bodybuilding Hard.</p><p>Achieving a bodybuilder’s physique isn’t complicated, no matter what the endless range of supplements suggests. You need to: exercise frequently with heavy weights; and consistently eat a protein rich diet. Neither is a secret or complicated to understand. Most people, in shape or not, know this stuff. The problem is that doing these things is intrinsically hard. It requires strenuous activity that’s much less fun than seeing friends over beers and burgers.</p><p>Most valuable achievements are Bodybuilding Hard. Learning a new skill, becoming wealthy, being a good partner – all require effort. Practically everyone knows more or less how to achieve these things, but few actually do. That’s why there is a supplement shortcut for every industry: pointy guitars; self help books; and magazines with fancy bedroom techniques.</p><p>Bodybuilding Hard startups are everywhere. On demand services, marketplaces, ecommerce – they’re the backbone of Rocket Internet’s portfolio. They don’t have Pythagorean secrets. These businesses are a pain to run, requiring the coordination of thousands of people and complex operations.</p><p>Without a secret, beating everyone else is hard. But bodybuilding isn’t economically self-sustaining&nbsp;if&nbsp;you’re&nbsp;just&nbsp;good: you need to be the best. Despite small differences, the winner still takes it all.</p><p>Hence, bodybuilding is riddled with steroids and techniques to eek out tiny advantages. Bodybuilding startups are no different — only their steroids are cash, experience, and thousands of traumatised former bankers and consultants.</p><p>The more success you have through doing something Bodybuilding Hard, the more people are going to be incentivised to try to do the same thing. If it’s a startup worth starting, eventually the payoff must outweigh the hardness. And once it’s clear it does, your competition will bring steroids.</p><p>Bodybuilding Hardness, like Math Hardness, buys you time. How much time? Once again, some amount of time inversely proportional to how much success you’re having. The better it’s going, the less time you have left.</p><p>Both types of hardness are good ways to get started. Doing something hard buys you a window of opportunity to succeed. But, once you’re big, something else has to keep you there.</p><p>Defensibility doesn’t imply hardness in the long run, even if hardness is useful in the beginning. For the best companies, things get easier after the hard part.</p><p>Their long term advantage doesn’t require new insights or ongoing effort: it’s too hard to compete like this once the stakes are high enough. Their advantage is unique resource accumulation – like Google’s datasets or Apple’s brand, or scale-enabled product differentiation – like Uber’s liquidity or Amazon’s delivery infrastructure. You need to snowball.</p><p>Doing something hard can put you ahead of your competition, but it isn’t the hardness that will keep you there.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1553598693305_327084"><div><p>Thanks to the EF team for reading drafts of this.

<p>The importance of testing in modern software development is really hard to overstate. Delivering a successful product is not something you do once and forget about but is rather a continuous recurring process. With every line of code that changes, software must remain in a functional state, which implies the need for rigorous testing.</p>
<p>Over time, as the software industry evolved, testing practices have matured as well. Gradually moving towards automation, testing approaches have also influenced software design itself, spawning mantras like test-driven development, emphasizing patterns such as dependency inversion, and popularizing high-level architectures that are built around it.</p>
<p>Nowadays, automated testing is embedded so deeply within our perception of software development, it’s hard to imagine one without the other. And since that ultimately enables us to produce software quickly without sacrificing quality, it’s hard to argue that it’s not a good thing.</p>
<p>However, despite there being many different approaches, modern “best practices” primarily push developers specifically towards <em>unit testing</em>. Tests, whose scope lies higher on <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html#TheTestPyramid">Mike Cohn’s pyramid</a> are either written as part of a wider suite (often by completely different people) or even disregarded entirely.</p>
<p>The benefit of this approach is often supported by the argument that unit tests provide the most value during development because they’re able to catch errors quickly and help enforce design patterns that facilitate modularity. This idea has become so widely accepted that the term “unit testing” is now somewhat conflated with automated testing in general, losing part of its meaning and contributing to confusion.</p>
<p>When I was a less experienced developer, I believed in following these “best practices” to the letter, as I thought that would make my code better. I didn’t particularly enjoy writing unit tests because of all the ceremony involved with abstractions and mocking, but it was the recommended approach after all, so who am I to know better.</p>
<p>It was only later, as I’ve experimented more and built more projects, that I started to realize that there are much better ways to approach testing and that <strong>focusing on unit tests is</strong>, in most cases, <strong>a complete waste of time</strong>.</p>
<p>Aggressively popularized “best practices” often have a tendency of manifesting cargo cults around them, enticing developers to apply design patterns or use specific approaches without giving them a much needed second thought. In the context of automated testing, I find this prevalent when it comes to our industry’s unhealthy obsession with unit testing.</p>
<p>In this article I will share my observations about this testing technique and go over why I believe it to be inefficient. I’ll also explain which approaches I’m currently using instead to test my code, both in open source projects and day-to-day work.</p>
<p><em>Note: this article contains code examples which are written in C#, but the language itself is not (too) important to the points I’m making.</em></p>
<p><em>Note 2: I’ve come to realize that programming terms are completely useless at conveying meanings because everyone seems to understand them differently. In this article I will be relying on the “standard” definitions, where unit testing targets smallest separable parts of code, end-to-end testing targets software’s outermost entry points, while integration testing is for everything in-between.</em></p>
<p><em>Note 3: if you don’t feel like reading the entirety of the article, you can skip to the end for the summary.</em></p>
<h2>Fallacies of unit testing</h2>
<p>Unit tests, as evident by the name, revolve around the concept of a “unit”, which denotes a very small isolated part of a larger system. There is no formal definition of what a unit is or how small it should be, but it’s mostly accepted that it corresponds to an individual function of a module (or method of an object).</p>
<p>Normally, when the code isn’t written with unit tests in mind, it may be impossible to test some functions in complete isolation because they can have external dependencies. In order to <em>work around</em> this issue, we can apply the dependency inversion principle and replace concrete dependencies with abstractions. These abstractions can then be substituted with real or fake implementations, depending on whether the code is executing normally or as part of a test.</p>
<p>Besides that, unit tests are expected to be pure. For example, if a function contains code that writes data to the file system, that part needs to be abstracted away as well, otherwise the test that verifies such behavior will be considered an integration test instead, since its coverage extends to the unit’s integration with the file system.</p>
<p>Considering the factors mentioned above, we can reason that <strong>unit tests are only useful to verify pure business logic inside of a given function</strong>. Their scope does not extend to testing side-effects or other integrations because that belongs to the domain of integration testing.</p>
<p>To illustrate how these nuances affect design, let’s take a look at an example of a simple system that we want to test. Imagine we’re working on an application that calculates local sunrise and sunset times, which it does through the help of the following two classes:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>LocationProvider</span> <span>:</span> <span>IDisposable</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>HttpClient</span> _httpClient <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>HttpClient</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    
    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>string</span> locationQuery<span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>

    
    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>Dispose</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> _httpClient<span>.</span><span>Dispose</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>SolarCalculator</span> <span>:</span> <span>IDiposable</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>LocationProvider</span> _locationProvider <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>LocationProvider</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    
    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>SolarTimes<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetSolarTimesAsync</span><span>(</span><span>DateTimeOffset</span> date<span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>Dispose</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> _locationProvider<span>.</span><span>Dispose</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Although the design above is perfectly valid in terms of OOP, neither of these classes are actually unit-testable. Because <code>LocationProvider</code> depends on its own instance of <code>HttpClient</code> and <code>SolarCalculator</code> in turn depends on <code>LocationProvider</code>, it’s impossible to isolate the business logic that may be contained within methods of these classes.</p>
<p>Let’s iterate on that code and replace concrete implementations with abstractions:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>interface</span> <span>ILocationProvider</span>
<span>{</span>
    Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>string</span> locationQuery<span>)</span><span>;</span>

    Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>LocationProvider</span> <span>:</span> <span>ILocationProvider</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>HttpClient</span> _httpClient<span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>LocationProvider</span><span>(</span><span>HttpClient</span> httpClient<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        _httpClient <span>=</span> httpClient<span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>string</span> locationQuery<span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>public</span> <span>interface</span> <span>ISolarCalculator</span>
<span>{</span>
    Task<span>&lt;</span>SolarTimes<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetSolarTimesAsync</span><span>(</span><span>DateTimeOffset</span> date<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>SolarCalculator</span> <span>:</span> <span>ISolarCalculator</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>ILocationProvider</span> _locationProvider<span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>SolarCalculator</span><span>(</span><span>ILocationProvider</span> locationProvider<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        _locationProvider <span>=</span> locationProvider<span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>SolarTimes<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetSolarTimesAsync</span><span>(</span><span>DateTimeOffset</span> date<span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>By doing so we were able to decouple <code>LocationProvider</code> from <code>SolarCalculator</code>, but in exchange our code nearly doubled in size. Also note that we had to drop <code>IDisposable</code> from both classes because they <strong>no longer own their dependencies</strong> and thus have no business taking responsibility for their lifecycle.</p>
<p>While these changes may seem as an improvement to some, it’s important to point out that the interfaces we’ve defined serve <strong>no practical purpose other than making unit testing possible</strong>. There’s no need for actual polymorphism in our design, so, as far as our code is concerned, these abstractions are <em>autotelic</em> (i.e. abstractions for the sake of abstractions).</p>
<p>Let’s try to reap the benefits of all that work and write a unit test for <code>SolarCalculator.GetSolarTimesAsync</code>:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>SolarCalculatorTests</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>[</span><span>Fact</span><span>]</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> <span>Task</span> <span>GetSolarTimesAsync_ForKyiv_ReturnsCorrectSolarTimes</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        
        <span>var</span> location <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Location</span><span>(</span><span>50.45</span><span>,</span> <span>30.52</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
        <span>var</span> date <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>DateTimeOffset</span><span>(</span><span>2019</span><span>,</span> <span>11</span><span>,</span> <span>04</span><span>,</span> <span>00</span><span>,</span> <span>00</span><span>,</span> <span>00</span><span>,</span> TimeSpan<span>.</span><span>FromHours</span><span>(</span><span>+</span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

        <span>var</span> expectedSolarTimes <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>SolarTimes</span><span>(</span>
            <span>new</span> <span>TimeSpan</span><span>(</span><span>06</span><span>,</span> <span>55</span><span>,</span> <span>00</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
            <span>new</span> <span>TimeSpan</span><span>(</span><span>16</span><span>,</span> <span>29</span><span>,</span> <span>00</span><span>)</span>
        <span>)</span><span>;</span>

        <span>var</span> locationProvider <span>=</span> Mock<span>.</span><span><span>Of</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ILocationProvider</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>(</span>lp <span>=&gt;</span>
            lp<span>.</span><span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> Task<span>.</span><span>FromResult</span><span>(</span>location<span>)</span>
        <span>)</span><span>;</span>

        <span>var</span> solarCalculator <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>SolarCalculator</span><span>(</span>locationProvider<span>)</span><span>;</span>

        
        <span>var</span> solarTimes <span>=</span> <span>await</span> solarCalculator<span>.</span><span>GetSolarTimesAsync</span><span>(</span>date<span>)</span><span>;</span>

        
        solarTimes<span>.</span><span>Should</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>BeEquivalentTo</span><span>(</span>expectedSolarTimes<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here we have a basic test that verifies that <code>SolarCalculator</code> works correctly for a known location. Since unit tests and their units are tightly coupled, we’re following the recommended naming convention, where the test class is named after the class under test, and the name of the test method follows the <code>Method_Precondition_Result</code> pattern.</p>
<p>In order to simulate the desired precondition in the arrange phase, we have to inject corresponding behavior into the unit’s dependency, <code>ILocationProvider</code>. In this case we do that by substituting the return value of <code>GetLocationAsync()</code> with a location for which the correct solar times are already known ahead of time.</p>
<p>Note that although <code>ILocationProvider</code> exposes two different methods, from the contract perspective <strong>we have no way of knowing which one actually gets called</strong>. This means that by choosing to mock a specific one of these methods, we are making an <strong>assumption about the underlying implementation</strong> of the method we’re testing (which was deliberately hidden in the previous snippets).</p>
<p>All in all, the test does correctly verify that the business logic inside <code>GetSolarTimesAsync</code> works as expected. However, let’s expand on some of the observations we’ve made in the process.</p>

   <p><!--<img align="left" src="../pics/motherboard-and-hands-320.jpg" alt="Motherboard and Hands" style="max-width:100%;height:auto; padding:15px;">-->I think Covid-19 has re-emphasized the value of self-reliance
      to many of us.  During this pandemic, we have been through
      periods when we couldn't simply pick up a phone and call someone 
      to come to our home to make repairs.  We may also have been 
      unable to go to a local shop to get help.  Since so much of our 
      personal business must now be conducted on line, finding inexpensive 
      computers and making basic repairs to our own computers 
      are becoming important life skills.  Without them, we may be unable 
      to stay connected to the world, to attend school, to work, or even to 
      buy food without risking exposure to a potentially deadly disease.</p>

   <p>Fortunately, repairing a computer or buying a cheap used one is not as 
      difficult as many people seem to believe.  All that is needed is the 
      will to learn to do these things in a hands-on way.  Individuals must 
      be willing to take the risks associated with trying to repair 
      their own computers or buying used computers on line.  For most people, 
      I think this is the stumbling block that they never overcome.  
      What separates the people who can do these things from those who 
      cannot is not intelligence.  It is nothing more than need and 
      interest sufficient to get them past the stumbling block.  
      If you are willing to learn, you will win the battle for 
      computer self-reliance.  I will not tell you that you will not be 
      frustrated at times.  I will only say that, if you keep trying, you 
      will learn these skills.</p>

   <p>In this article, I will outline the knowledge and skills that are 
      necessary to solve most basic computer repair problems.  But first, I 
      will explain one simple step that you can take right now to have a 
      working computer in your home at all times.</p>

   <p>Have a working backup computer in your home to use in the event of 
      the death or loss of your primary 
      computer.  A backup computer need not be expensive.  In fact, you can 
      buy a useful, used computer on Ebay for around $50.  The role of this 
      computer is only to get you on line to do research or to buy parts or 
      other necessities until you can get your primary computer working 
      again, or until you can buy another computer.  A rather 
      <a href="https://cheapskatesguide.org/articles/surf-internet.html">old computer</a> is capable of meeting 
      these needs.  Some of you may want to use a cellphone for this, and 
      that will work if your cellphone service includes a data plan.  However, 
      for reasons that will become clear later, a fully-functioning computer 
      would be better.  I have written several articles on

   <p>Now, let me talk about what you need to know to make basic computer 
      repairs.  If you take good care of your computer, the only computer 
      repair that you are likely to need that is not basic is the 
      replacement of your motherboard.  So, if your computer is completely 
      dead or stops booting at the BIOS screen (both symptoms of a bad 
      motherboard), it is most likely time to buy another computer.  If any 
      life at all remains in your computer--if you hear beep codes (beeping 
      sounds when you turn on your computer), see a repeating 
      pattern of flashing 
      lights, or see an error message on the monitor--you may be looking at 
      a computer that you can repair with basic skills.  Below, are the 
      skills that everyone can learn and then use to make basic computer 
      repairs.  Everyone should be able to:</p>
   <br>

   <div>
   <center><h2>Basic Computer Repair Skills Everyone should have</h2></center>
   <ul>
      <li>Diagnose basic computer problems</li>
      <li>Identify compatible parts for a computer</li>
      <li>Research repair methods on line</li>
      <li>Make basic changes to a computer's BIOS settings</li>
      <li>Create a bootable Linux USB drive</li>
      <li>Re-install software</li>
      <li>Replace a hard drive or solid state drive</li>
   </ul>
   </div>
   <p>When you think about it, that is a rather short list.  I think that a
      simple lack 
      of desire is the only thing that prevents most people from obtaining 
      these skills.  In this article, I will not teach you these skills.  I 
      will tell you what you need to know and a little about how to find 
      that knowledge.  I will tell you how to develop the skills.  And, in 
      some cases, I will outline basic repair procedures and tell you how 
      to fill in the details yourself.</p>
   <h2>Diagnosing Basic Computer Problems</h2>
   <p>Most symptoms of computer problems are pretty obvious.  Your keyboard 
      stops working.  A USB connector stops working.  Your computer's monitor 
      doesn't light up.  A message appears on your monitor saying that no 
      operating system was found.  Your computer's sound stops working.  
      The question is not whether a problem exists but whether it is 
      a software problem or a hardware problem.</p><p>The easiest way to rule out a hardware problem is to boot your 
      computer from a reliable, bootable Linux USB flash drive.  If the 
      problem does not go away, then you most likely have a hardware 
      problem.  One obvious exception is that the problem will go away if 
      your hard drive is bad.  I recommend creating a bootable Linux Mint 
      USB flash drive, making sure it works with every piece of hardware on 
      your computer, and setting it aside for when you need it.  Another
      benefit of having a Linux USB flash drive is that if your hard
      drive dies, you will still be able to use your computer to get online.</p>

   <p>If the problem is caused by software, an online search will give you 
      possible sources and procedures to follow to narrow down the problem 
      to one source.  If an error message appears, use an online search 
      engine to search for that exact error message with quotes around it.  
      If you have no error message, you may have more difficulty finding 
      information about the exact source of your problem.  This process can 
      sometimes take several hours, but you are likely to eventually find 
      hints that will lead you to solutions for most computer software 
      problems, especially if the software is common.</p><h2>Identifying Compatible Parts for Your Computer</h2>
   <p>On a modern laptop computer, the battery and hard drive are the only 
      parts that are likely to fail that you can replace with basic 
      skills.  In over 30 years of owning computers, I have never had a 
      single stick of RAM fail.  I have had RAM sticks that have become 
      unseated from their connectors and needed to be pushed back into 
      place.  Beep codes or flashing lights can give you a hint that RAM 
      has become unseated.  Search on line for "computer beep codes" to find 
      the specific beep codes for your computer.</p> 

   <p>You generally only need to know three things to locate a 
      hard drive or Solid State Drive (SSD) that is compatible with your 
      computer: the hard drive's width, its thickness, and the type of 
      connector to which it connects.  You need to buy a replacement hard 
      drive that will physically fit into the space in your computer, and  
      the connector of the hard drive must connect to the connector on your 
      computer's motherboard.  These days, all spinning hard drives are 
      either 2.5 or 3.5 inches wide with SATA connectors.  Most 
      regular-sized desktop computers have 3.5 inch hard drives, but a 
      laptop will never have a 3.5 inch hard drive.  Laptops have either 2.5 
      inch spinning hard drives or some kind of SSD.  If your computer has 
      an SSD, you will have to open up your computer and look at the SSD's
      connector.  Unfortunately, these days, there are a small number of 
      solid state drive connector types that have the same physical 
      connections but are different electrically.  In my opinion, this was 
      a very poor design decision.  Luckily, these SSD's are the only 
      example in the computer industry of which I am aware of this being 
      allowed to occur.  Find a picture of your SSD's connector online and see 
      what type of connector the online source says it is.  Wikipedia is 
      a good place to look for this type of information.  Once you have 
      identified the type of connector on your SSD, see what Wikipedia says 
      about its electrical arrangement.  Do not try to use an SSD with a 
      different type of electrical arrangement, because this is likely to 
      damage the replacement SSD and your computer.</p>
   <h2>Researching Computer Repair Methods on Line</h2>
   <p>When your computer develops a problem, you can almost always find a 
      procedure on line for solving it.  First, you need to know <i>what</i> to 
      do to repair a generic computer with the specific problem you are 
      seeing.  You can read on line about <i>what</i> to do to repair the 
      problem on a generic Windows, Mac, or Linux computer.  Then, if the 
      problem is a hardware problem, you need to know <i>how</i> to 
      physically accomplish the repair of your specific model of computer.  
      A Youtube video can be beneficial for this.  An example of 
      what I mean by "<i>how</i> to physically repair" is the following.  When 
      you open the back of your laptop, what screws do you have to unscrew 
      to release the hard drive?  Do you pull the hard drive straight out 
      perpendicularly from the back of the laptop?  Or, do you slide it 
      parallel to the back of the laptop …</p></div></div>

<p>Do you like language? I'm not crazy about spending a lot of time learning a new language but I'm endlessly fascinated with the way new languages are created and old ones disappear.</p>
<p>John McWhorter is too. He's been studying this for many decades. I love hearing about how idioms and odd phrases happen, both in English and other languages. Are African-Americans creating a new pronoun? Did the original settlers of Appalachia speak with an English/Scottish/Irish accent? What are some of the most complex languages on the planet, and how did they get that way?</p>
<p>Every week is cool new subjects like that. John's also a show tunes fan, so he freely mixes in classic Broadway show tunes and other older masterpieces along with the chat. One of my favorite podcasts ever. I always look forward to the new installment.</p>            </div>

<pre>https://hnrss.org/whoishiring/jobs?q=React+Native
</pre>
<h3 id="user-feeds">User Feeds</h3>
<p>If you don’t want to miss a post or comment by a given user, you can subscribe to that user’s feed:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/submitted?id=USERNAME # posts
https://hnrss.org/threads?id=USERNAME   # comments
https://hnrss.org/user?id=USERNAME      # everything
</pre>
<h3 id="thread-feeds">Thread Feeds</h3>
<p>A feed of new comments on a particular post can be found at:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/item?id=THREAD_ID
</pre>
<p>With <code>THREAD_ID</code> the numerical ID found in the URL when viewing the comments page.</p>
<h3 id="feed-options">Feed Options</h3>
<p>You can modify any feed’s output using URL parameters. Multiple parameters can be applied at the same time by joining them with an ampersand.</p>
<h4 id="activity-parameters">Activity Parameters</h4>
<p>You can apply a <code>points=N</code> or <code>comments=N</code> parameter to any feed to filter the results so only entries with more than N points or comments are shown:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest?points=100
https://hnrss.org/ask?comments=25
</pre>
<p>You can also combine both parameters:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/show?points=100&amp;comments=25
</pre>
<p>Unfortunately, <code>/newcomments</code> <a href="https://github.com/algolia/hn-search/issues/55#issuecomment-73599729">does not work</a> with a <code>points=N</code> parameter.</p>
<h4 id="search-parameter">Search Parameter</h4>
<p>By default, searches on posts only look at titles. If you want to search against the submitted URLs themselves, use the <code>search_attrs</code> parameter.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<pre># Search for posts with "WordPress" in the title only
https://hnrss.org/newest?q=WordPress

# Search for posts with 'WordPress' in the URL only
https://hnrss.org/newest?q=WordPress&amp;search_attrs=url

# Search for posts with 'WordPress' in the title or URL
https://hnrss.org/newest?q=WordPress&amp;search_attrs=title,url

# Don't restrict search attributes at all. This searches for posts
# containing 'WordPress' in all attributes indexed by Algolia. This was
# the behavior of searches prior to June 3, 2015
https://hnrss.org/newest?q=WordPress&amp;search_attrs=default
</pre>
<h4 id="link-parameter">Link Parameter</h4>
<p>By default, the RSS <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element points to the submitted article’s URL. The <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element can be changed to point to the Hacker News comment page by appending <code>link=comments</code> to the end of the URL. For example:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest?link=comments</pre>
<h4 id="description-parameter">Description Parameter</h4>
<p>You can disable the <code>&lt;description&gt;</code> element entirely by passing the <code>description=0</code> parameter:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest?description=0</pre>
<h4 id="count-parameter">Count Parameter</h4>
<p>By default, feeds return 20 RSS items. This can be increased via the <code>count=N</code> parameter:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest?count=50</pre>
<p>There is a hardcoded limit of 100 entries, so keep that in mind.</p>
<h4 id="feed-formats">Feed Formats <sup>new</sup></h4>
<p>By default, feeds come back as RSS. But if you add “.atom” or “.jsonfeed” to any endpoint you’ll receive the contents in <a href="https://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/atom.html">Atom</a> or <a href="https://jsonfeed.org/">JSON Feed</a>, respectively.</p>
<pre># The front page as Atom
https://hnrss.org/frontpage.atom

# "Ask HN" with 10 or more comments as JSON Feed
https://hnrss.org/ask.jsonfeed?comments=10
</pre>
<p>Note: These formats are a lot less battle-tested than the RSS format. If you see any wonkiness or they don’t play nicely with your feed reader, please <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss/issues/new">open an issue</a> with as much information as possible. Thanks!</p>

<h2 id="colophon">Colophon</h2>
<p>hnrss.org is served by nginx on DigitalOcean. HTTPS is provided by Let’s Encrypt. DNS is provided by Namecheap.</p>
<p>As of September 2018, the feeds are generated using the <a href="https://gin-gonic.github.io/gin/">Gin</a> web framework. From May 2014 to August 2018, the feeds were generated using the <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> web framework.</p>
<h2 id="repositories">Repositories</h2>
<p>A brief primer on the various repositories that make up hnrss.org:</p>
<p>When hnrss.org was created in May 2014, code and documentation lived inside the <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss">edavis/hnrss</a> repository.</p>
<p>In April 2017, the documentation was revamped, migrated into Hugo, and was given its own repository at <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss-docs">edavis/hnrss-docs</a>. The built assets were copied into the <code>docs/</code> folder on <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss">edavis/hnrss</a> and published at <a href="https://edavis.github.io/hnrss/">https://edavis.github.io/hnrss/</a>.</p>
<p>In August/September 2018, hnrss.org underwent a rewrite from Flask to Gin. This new code lives at <a href="https://github.com/edavis/go-hnrss">edavis/go-hnrss</a>.</p>
<p>So, as of September 2018, that’s the state of play. The documentation source lives at <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss-docs">edavis/hnrss-docs</a>. The Gin source that powers hnrss.org lives at <a href="https://github.com/edavis/go-hnrss">edavis/go-hnrss</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss">edavis/hnrss</a> contains the Flask code that powered the site from May 2014 to August 2018 as well as the <code>docs/</code> folder that contains the built HTML copied from <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss-docs">edavis/hnrss-docs</a>.</p>
<p>At some point I’d like to simplify all of this and run everything out of one repository, but it’ll do for now.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>AWS SDK maintains and publishes SDK for over 110+ services with simultaneous and multiple updates on all SDKs each day. They have achieved what interestingly all big companies strive for, launching new APIs seamlessly and effortlessly. During AWS’s flagship entertainment packed conference <strong>“Re</strong><strong>:Invent</strong><strong>,</strong> the SDKs are updated with new APIs that were just announced in less than 2 hours for the world to use.</p><p>To interact with any of AWS services you need to use a AWS SDK in either python, JAVA or any other language your software is in.</p><p>I have been an engineer in the PHP SDK for AWS which is open-sourced on Github and anyone can look at the code published by the AWS teams. AWS manages over 8 SDKs including SDK for <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java">JAVA</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby">ruby</a>, <a href="https://github.com/boto/boto3">python</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js">javascript</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php">PHP</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go">go</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-cpp">C++</a> and few other languages.</p><p>Generally, it requires a significant number of engineers to manage just one SDK. To make sure all APIs and features are available across all SDKs is a big feat. In this post, we are going to talk about how to scale the SDK and how AWS is able to achieve perfect synchronicity across all SDKs without sloshing the SDKs team with manually updating each SDK.</p><h2>How does the AWS SDK works?</h2><p>All of the SDKs have two parts one is the core and another one has all the service-specific code. The core of the SDK handles various features such as “Signing each request using AWS’s Sigv4 protocol”, security features, SSL handling, multi-threading, asynchronous requests, waiters, paginators, and a ton more features.</p><p>The other part of each SDK is based on “model” files specific to each service. All model files are exactly similar across each SDK.</p><p>The difference is very evident in AWS’s python SDK which is divided into two different repositories “boto” and “botocore”.</p><p>All the model files are built on <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenApi</a> protocol to some extent and are compatible with <a href="https://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> API Protocols.</p><p>Here is a JSON definition for DynamoDB in AWS PHP SDK with name “<a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/blob/master/src/data/dynamodb/2012-08-10/api-2.json">api-2.json</a>” and &nbsp;the exact same file also exists in Boto SDK as well with name “<a href="https://github.com/boto/botocore/blob/develop/botocore/data/dynamodb/2012-08-10/service-2.json">service-2.json</a>“</p><p>At AWS each service will release these JSON model files which specify all information related to each API &amp; service. Each SDK handles these files a bit differently as compared to other SDKs. PHP SDK loads these JSON files dynamically in each client to allow various APIs while JAVA SDK will pre-build each of these methods into concrete classes.</p><p>Each AWS team maintains and releases these service-specific model file, which are then consumed by each SDK team in the way they would like.</p><h2>Show Me The Code!</h2><p>I am sure these look like magic to you like it looked to me when I first saw it. So let’s dig into the code. We will look at PHP SDK example as that is team I was part of for over a year and know in and out of the SDK.</p><p>We will look at the AWS Lambda’s invoke method.</p><pre><code>"Invoke":{
      "name":"Invoke",
      "http":{
        "method":"POST",
        "requestUri":"/2015-03-31/functions/{FunctionName}/invocations"
      },
      "input":{"shape":"InvocationRequest"},
      "output":{"shape":"InvocationResponse"},
      "errors":[
        {"shape":"ServiceException"},
        {"shape":"ResourceNotFoundException"},
        {"shape":"InvalidRequestContentException"},
        {"shape":"RequestTooLargeException"},
        {"shape":"UnsupportedMediaTypeException"},
        {"shape":"TooManyRequestsException"},
        {"shape":"InvalidParameterValueException"},
        {"shape":"EC2UnexpectedException"},
        {"shape":"SubnetIPAddressLimitReachedException"},
        {"shape":"ENILimitReachedException"},
        {"shape":"EC2ThrottledException"},
        {"shape":"EC2AccessDeniedException"},
        {"shape":"InvalidSubnetIDException"},
        {"shape":"InvalidSecurityGroupIDException"},
        {"shape":"InvalidZipFileException"},
        {"shape":"KMSDisabledException"},
        {"shape":"KMSInvalidStateException"},
        {"shape":"KMSAccessDeniedException"},
        {"shape":"KMSNotFoundException"},
        {"shape":"InvalidRuntimeException"}
      ]
    }</code></pre><p>The above API is expecting an “InvocationRequest” object and returns a “InvocationResponse” object.</p><p>This is how the “InvocationRequest” is defined.</p><pre><code>"InvocationRequest":{
      "type":"structure",
      "required":["FunctionName"],
      "members":{
        "FunctionName":{
          "shape":"NamespacedFunctionName",
          "location":"uri",
          "locationName":"FunctionName"
        },
        "InvocationType":{
          "shape":"InvocationType",
          "location":"header",
          "locationName":"X-Amz-Invocation-Type"
        },
        "LogType":{
          "shape":"LogType",
          "location":"header",
          "locationName":"X-Amz-Log-Type"
        },
        "ClientContext":{
          "shape":"String",
          "location":"header",
          "locationName":"X-Amz-Client-Context"
        },
        "Payload":{"shape":"Blob"},
        "Qualifier":{
          "shape":"Qualifier",
          "location":"querystring",
          "locationName":"Qualifier"
        }
      },
      "payload":"Payload"
    }</code></pre><p>This is the response object.</p><pre><code> "InvocationResponse":{
      "type":"structure",
      "members":{
        "StatusCode":{
          "shape":"Integer",
          "location":"statusCode"
        },
        "FunctionError":{
          "shape":"String",
          "location":"header",
          "locationName":"X-Amz-Function-Error"
        },
        "LogResult":{
          "shape":"String",
          "location":"header",
          "locationName":"X-Amz-Log-Result"
        },
        "Payload":{"shape":"Blob"},
        "ExecutedVersion":{
          "shape":"Version",
          "location":"header",
          "locationName":"X-Amz-Executed-Version"
        }
      },
      "payload":"Payload"
    },</code></pre><p>The PHP SDK auto-generates code for each of these request and response object and here how the code would look:</p><pre><code>$result = $client-&gt;invoke(array(
    // FunctionName is required
    'FunctionName' =&gt; 'string',
    'InvocationType' =&gt; 'string',
    'LogType' =&gt; 'string',
    'ClientContext' =&gt; 'string',
    'Payload' =&gt; 'mixed type: string|resource|\Guzzle\Http\EntityBodyInterface',
    'Qualifier' =&gt; 'string',
));</code></pre><p>Even the docs are automatically generated from the model files.</p><p>So the various SDK team will not need to write any code “manually” at all for any of these service updates. The service teams,( in this case, AWS Lambda) just needs to make sure that the model file they are creating is error free. The SDK will be able to auto-generate any updates to existing clients as well as auto-generating code for new APIs and services.</p><p>The best part of the SDK team is that is is completely open-sources and is directly integrated into various AWS services.</p><p>API Gateway allows you to deploy Swagger (also knows as OpenAPI Standards) models and then use the APIs to directly generate SDKs with all the features that are already inbuilt into the AWS SDKs.</p><p>I hope this will prove helpful in designing your SDKs for your services. In any SDK the focus should be on creating a model file that is compliant with “OpenApi” standards. By having a standard model for APIs, it will get super easy and fast to launch various SDKs in various languages with very little development time.</p><div><div><div><p><a href="https://dailyjag.com/profile/admin/" rel="author"> <img alt="" src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/33563973b6f338002e574f30a3f94788?s=80&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/33563973b6f338002e574f30a3f94788?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" height="80" width="80"> </a></p><div> <p><span>  </span> <span> <span>Member since</span> <time datetime="2019-02-25 10:02"> August 16, 2011 </time> </span></p></div></div><p><span>I am an android developer, hacker, web developer, professional blogger and a complete tech freak.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>February 2015</h3><p>I was working for a startup based in Jerusalem called Curiyo. Back then I had a nice routine: I wake up around 6 am, go to the gym with my buddy, come back to my room to take a shower, eat a bowl of salad and then leave for work. I get to work around 9 am, leave around 5 to meet friends, hang out, or do whatever activity I was planning for that evening.</p><p>In September of the same year, I went on my first trip abroad. I went with my best friend from high school on a 2-week trip to Italy. And as they say, I caught the travel bug. After that trip, all I could think about was planning the next ones and when I could fly again. And since then, I started traveling literally every month.</p><p>One day, I found a blog post about digital nomads and remote work. "This is it, this is what I want!", I said to myself, and the race began to figure out how I could make that happen. A couple of months later, I landed my first remote job with Toptal and signed up for a 3-month trip around southeast Asia (SEA). And in September 2016 -a year after my first trip- I was in Thailand working remotely, enjoying the beach, drinking fresh coconut water, and calling myself a digital nomad.</p><p>"Work hard, play harder": that is the digital nomad slogan. Each day’s schedule looked different from the day before, depending on what I felt like doing or what the group I’m with is planning. In other words, it’s impossible to have a fixed routine, you have to be flexible and dynamic. Otherwise, you will either have to choose between FOMO or doing a shitty job at your work so you don’t miss whatever fun others are having.</p><h3>February 2017</h3><p>After my 3-month trip to SEA, it was time to go back to Jerusalem to see my family and plan the next move. I wasn’t excited to go back, I grew up in Jerusalem and till that point, it’s where I spent all my life. It was so hard and boring after what I’ve experienced, I just came back after spending 3 months in heaven.</p><p>Suddenly there were no more beaches, no more parties, or random strangers to hang out with. There was a lot of free time thatI had no idea what to do with. All I was doing every day was leaving my parents’ house, go to the university campus where I spent five years getting my computer engineering degree, and work till it’s so hard to keep my eyes open.</p><p>I filled all the free time I had with work. I created an outsource web development company with a friend and worked 14h a day 7 days a week, I became a workaholic. I was hoping that by creating a successful business I will have the means to escape my city and move elsewhere to go back to the heavenly life I had for a short period.</p><p>After 3 months of long days and restless nights mishmash, I realized that wasn’t what I wanted. Of course, I still wanted to build my own business, but I didn’t like the path I was taking. And one day I found myself writing this:</p><p>I woke up late, as usual, tried to open my exhausted eyelids. I had skipped the usual question “What’s the plan for today?” and left my bed. It has been almost 3 months since the last time I answered that question, after the first week of going back to Jerusalem it was the same day repeating itself over and over again. Wake up, go to the university campus, meet the same people, and work for 12-14 hours.</p><p>Everything was the same that day except one thing, one thought. When suddenly I found myself shouting out loud to myself “Oh shit, I’m not happy, FUCK!” after a voice inside my head asked: “Are you happy?”. The answer was obviously no. I just realized I was on auto-pilot and forgot to ask myself such a trivial question. “If you are not happy, what is the point?” I kept asking myself for the rest of the day.</p><p>Work was just my way to escape reality and fill my free time. All that made me wonder: do I have to bury myself in work and live miserably now so that my future self can be happy?&nbsp;</p><p>Probably many of you will say “yes”, or maybe you will hesitate a bit before saying “no”. But that doesn’t change the fact that it is actually what we all do somehow. All of us work hard today hoping that tomorrow, next week, next month, or a year from now we will be happy, satisfied, and fulfilled.</p><p>This led me to another question that has changed everything: <strong>what is the point of chasing big dreams and goals if I'm not enjoying the way to get there?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I didn’t have a clear answer to this question so, in a way or another, my answer was <strong>procrastination</strong>. On one side, I wanted to build a business and create great things. On the other side, I didn’t want to work (hard) on anything as long as I don’t know how to be happy while doing it!</p><h3>June 2017</h3><p>After several months and hustling paperwork, I moved to Germany, and my digital nomad life was on again. Since then, I’ve spent the last 3+ years, traveling around the world, exploring, having fun, and creating memories. I was living the dream that many people dream of. A was living a life with no routine whatsoever, wake up whenever I want, work whenever I want, and tomorrow is always an unplanned adventure.</p><p>You can say everything was perfect, but still, the old dream was bugging me, I want to build and create a successful business, my own business. I never liked the idea of working for someone and trading my time for money. And between fun and procrastination, I was trying to build stuff and bootstrap ideas, but things were always falling between the cracks. With a lifestyle like that, it’s really hard to say no to the sunny beach outside and go work 10 hours on a side project. So as a result, procrastination became my new lifestyle.</p><h3>March 2020</h3><p>I left Mexico for a 2-week trip to San Francisco, I had a lot of traveling planned for this year. Things would have stayed on the same path as before for at least another couple of years if it wasn’t for COVID-19.<br></p><p>Two weeks into the pandemic, I found myself without work and without anything else to do. No travel, no friends around, nothing. This time, I didn’t only have a lot of free time, but all my time became free time. History got a chance to repeat itself, and I had a decision to make. Do I want to re-live 2017 all over again? Do I want to keep myself busy with side projects and endless work?&nbsp;<br></p><p>The feeling from 3 years ago was still fresh in my memory that I didn’t want to fall into that trap again. That was an opportunity I had to take advantage of. I was living alone with no distraction of any kind, It was a chance to rediscover myself and what I really want.</p><p>My goal was to bootstrap a business while having a work life balance. I didn’t want to spend 14 hours on my laptop and feel like it was sucking the life out of me. I believed it was possible to bootstrap without falling into the workaholism swamp.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eed2ff36d85f3277043492b/5f06d0eb03257a01af20a5e4_iZLNJNTTrlnhbqu6GYvnavIObyReSuyqU1-_DJxGfOeSpFmF8hzwy3AryXXXt0pxgt7dn0EkcqU2AAEDMG8i5AS7HAfEUP0GlsyIOdpqtN07TOSJopLFwNzxQ3HwUjMJw5YSN36s.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Earlier this year I was somewhere on the bottom left side. To shift toward the right I had to deal with my procrastination problem. Since nothing I’ve tried before worked for me, I decided to learn everything I can about the subject and challenge myself to write a book about it, this book! I’m trying to prove to myself (and others) that it’s possible to live in the middle, a place where you can be productive and happy.</p><p><strong>“A bird in the hand is worth t̶w̶o̶ ten in the bush”</strong></p><p>My best friend, who is running an online business with ~$300k ARR, is on the opposite side of the curve. He is the most dedicated hard working person I know, but he’s not happy. When I asked him about it, he said he doesn’t believe it’s possible to have that balance. For him, you can’t be productive (grow fast enough) and happy at the same time. His goal is to have a big stable business by age 40 so he can relax and enjoy life then.</p><p>I don’t want that, I don't want to build a business if my happiness is the price. I don't want to live on 30% happiness for the promise that my future self will be 100% in five or ten years. It's not only that 100% happiness is not realistic, but I also believe my future self will still be stuck on the same hamster wheel convincing himself that he needs another 5 years to get to the imaginary perfect happiness.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eed2ff36d85f3277043492b/5f06d0edf9a94c0bc0e6cd9f_Ngrb7PW6OqzpCoN3VZ8zAT8vHN_BKz_ZRkF_1Ze-89S6gTlwS6qyz89AWZIy-r5M6aleCzSf5xq-qp0OG1qkgdq14HcQdSlY1F6TkBny8CtjNETh2sdP4f0dgcuKCAnqFIVf3wiu.gif" alt=""></p></figure><p>Workaholism will blind you, you no longer see the big picture, you have no time to think and re-think, and you work for the sake of the work itself. And without a proper system and regular stops where you pause to double-check where you are heading, the wheel will just spin faster and faster until it eventually spits you out and throws you against the wall.</p><p>I know, sometimes you have something you are so excited about and it doesn’t feel like work. But pure excitement doesn’t last forever. Eventually, you will have to work on other boring and less exciting parts of your project. And once that initial excitement fades away, you either quit or close your eyes and hit the gas pedal to become a workaholic zombie.</p><p>However, life is not easy and you can’t always accomplish things while relaxing and taking it easy. Sometimes you have no other option but to push so hard, for days, weeks, or even months. The problem starts when you have no idea when you are going to lift your foot off the gas pedal to look around and see where you are going and check if you should make a turn and change directions.</p><p>So let’s glue all pieces together. A Procrastinator has this <strong>Instant Gratification Monkey (1)</strong> who wants immediate rewards, to have fun, and enjoy the moment without giving a shit about the future. A workaholic has a <strong>Panic Monster (2)</strong> who wants to work so hard and sacrifice everything today so you can be happy tomorrow.</p><p>The answer to the question: “How do you chase big dreams and without depriving yourself happiness?” is the same answer to the question: “Where could your instant gratification monkey meet your panic monster?” You need both.The monkey is as important as the monster, we’ll see that in the chapter “The Productive Procrastinator”. While in other chapters, we try to find that meeting point, as the sole purpose of this book is not to help you just be a productive person but a <strong>happy</strong> productive person.</p><p>1,2:&nbsp;originally presented in Tim Urban's <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html">blog post</a></p><p>‍<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eed2ff36d85f3277043492b/5ef900053c15adf3558a9fb8_1*Bx1xIfh3q-_hY0LzmbLePg.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>📕 This chapter is …</p></div></div>

                <div>
                    <p>Once you start working with international clients you'll run into many issues you will never experience when contracting for clients in the same country.</p><p>Language barriers, time zone differences or different cultures which could lead to different styles of communicating or different expectations to name just a few. </p><p>But the biggest one might be accepting payments. Cross-border payments are usually costly (both in fees and unfavorable exchange rates), take a long time to be processed and are sometimes even just hard to make as it's not a very common use case for most business owners. There's also different laws, taxes and payment methods.</p><p>The pandemic has made remote work a lot more common and many freelancers now have to deal with this new set of problems.</p><p>I have been working remotely since 2016 and worked for clients all over the world, used dozens of payment methods and dealt with both major and smaller currencies and want to share what I've learned over this period in terms of accepting payments.</p><p>Before we start, it's important to know there's no single best option as each situation is different. Payment frequency, invoice size, where each party is incorporated and many other variables might play a role in which payment method is best for your situation.</p><p>That being said, in every situation we want the same things. Make it easy for the client to pay you, make it easy for yourself to receive the money and do both of these in a timely and inexpensive way.</p><h2 id="international-bank-transfers">International Bank Transfers</h2><p>By far the most common payment method for domestic payments is to use a wire transfer. This works well for domestic payments but is very expensive and slow for cross-border payments.</p><p>Most banks charge a flat fee for processing international transfers but will also convert the money from the client's currency to yours at an exchange rate that is more expensive for you than the actual current exchange rate. My post about <a href="https://blog.jurn.io/international-payments-freelancers/">international transfers</a> explains the hidden costs of these payments more in-depth.</p><p>So before you ask your clients to transfer the money to your account, check with your bank what fees and exchange rates they use for the transfer. Some banks also give you the option to open a foreign currency account, if you regularly take payments in the same currency this could save you a lot in currency exchange fees.</p><h3 id="transferwise">TransferWise</h3><p>One of the best alternatives I found is to use <a href="https://transferwise.com/invite/u/joernv2">TransferWise</a>. TransferWise allows you to hold and accept multiple currencies and have local bank details in many different countries. You can then transfer the money you received at the mid-market exchange rate into your own currency and pay it out to your own bank account with low fixed fees.</p><p>Your client can thus transfer the payment to a local bank account like they would normally do for domestic payments. You can exchange this at a much better rate than banks would offer you and withdraw it to your own bank account for a low and transparent fixed fee.</p><p>This method offers the advantages of bank transfers without the downsides and has in my experience been both the cheapest and best way to accept payments for most situations.</p><p>If you are your client are in a country that is not supported by TransferWise you can also use <a href="https://www.payoneer.com/">Payoneer</a> which works in a very similar way and supports more countries around the world, albeit with higher fees than TW offers.</p><h2 id="credit-cards">Credit Cards</h2><p>Another very common payment method and one that is incredibly easy to pay with for your clients, credit cards.</p><p>Using online payment processors like Stripe, you can easily create an invoice along with a payment link where you client can pay using their credit card. The fees are pretty high, 3.4%+$0.50 per successful card charge and an additional 2% fee is applied if currency conversion is required so you have to be willing to accept high fees for speed and convenience.</p><p>Accepting credit cards is usually only worth it if you sent lots of small invoices and want a convenient way for you clients to pay these. </p><h2 id="paypal">PayPal</h2><p>PayPal was one of the pioneers in the payments industry but I'd strongly recommend using another option whenever possible. </p><p>Accepting payments via PayPal is easy. You can quickly generate a payment link for the client to sent with your invoice and you can easily create a PayPal account, no matter what country you are located in.</p><p>Unfortunately, their fees are very high (both the fixed fees and the currency conversion cost) and they are known for arbitrarily holding funds without good reason. Which they are allowed to do under their own ToC for up to 6 months(!).</p><p>If some of the better payment methods aren't available to you, PayPal might be the best option you have available but for most people it's probably better to steer clear of them. Even banks usually offer a better exchange rate than PayPal does.</p><h2 id="checks">Checks</h2><p>Most people outside of the US probably have never used a check to receive or make a payment so this could be quite a shock when your US client offers you to pay you using one.</p><p>My advice is to avoid these at all costs and talk to your client about setting up an alternative payment method. </p><p>Most non-US banks do not even have the option to cash these out and if they do it's very expensive. Checks, especially international ones, take a long time to arrive after they are mailed to you, they might get lost in the mail or sent to the wrong address, you (likely) need to mail these to your bank once you receive the check to cash it out and you still have to pay the unfavorable exchange rate.</p><p>In my personal experience, it will take around 4-6 weeks in total before the money from the client arrives in your account and you'll pay a very high fee for it.</p><p>Luckily these are becoming less common and I've head the good fortune of not having to deal with one of these for 2 years already.</p><h2 id="escrow">Escrow</h2><p>Escrow transfers are usually only worth it for selling big-ticket items where you need to transfer digital assets such as a domain. The fees are very high but it removes a lot of the risk when you work with a client that you haven't built up any trust with. </p><p>You should view Escrow as taking out an insurance, you accept a higher fee for less risk.</p><h2 id="cryptocurrency">Cryptocurrency</h2><p>Last time I wrote an article about cross-border payments <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22854120">some people commented</a> that crypto was the obvious solution here as there is no currency conversion and the transfer fees are very low. </p><p>I'd figure it's best to address this head-on this time; Although I love the concept of cryptocurrency, it's just not practical to use it for most freelancers. </p><p>Unless you work for a very high-tech startup, it's extremely unlikely someone in the company knows how to use one of these cryptocurrencies or will get permission to buy crypto and transfer it.</p><p>They are also extremely volatile, even though the transfer fees or currency exchange fees of conventional payment methods will cost you more, I have also never lost 10% of my company's liquid assets in a few minutes.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>As remote freelancers we are spoiled for choice nowadays and we have many different options to use depending on what situation we find ourselves in.</p><p>I have used every single option I discussed in the article and they all have their own pros and cons. There is no "one size fits all" solution here and you'll need to do some research to see what works best for the type of business that you run.</p><p>I've found that for my situation I most often end up using TransferWise to accept payment, convert the currency and deposit it to the bank account where my company is incorporated. </p><p>Whether this works best for you is something you will need to research for yourself based on your company and location.</p>

<p>Hello! 👋 My name is Jen and I’m the founder, engineer, designer and customer support at <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/">Lunch Money</a>, a personal finance and budgeting web app.</p>

<p>In short, I am a company of one. I answer the customer support emails and I code and deploy new features. I also manage the <a href="https://developers.lunchmoney.app/" target="_blank">API docs</a> and <a href="https://support.lunchmoney.app/" target="_blank">knowledge base</a>, poke around the logs when there are issues, write the <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/sample_newsletter" target="_blank">bi-monthly newsletters</a> and I designed the logo!</p>

<p>As the company scales, so too must all aspects of my work which I break down into 4 parts: customer support, engineering, product and marketing.</p>

<p><strong>Finding opportunities for process optimization is honestly one of the more fun parts of running a business</strong>. I greatly attribute these to how I’ve been able to stay both solo &amp; sane up until now, currently with 600+ users and $45,000 ARR. In this post, I’m excited to share some of my most successful strategies along with anecdotes from my experience working on Lunch Money.</p>



<p>In the last 14 days, here’s what I got done across all departments:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Product:</strong> Launched an internal beta testers program and two sets of new features to test</li>
<li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Wrapped up a 2-week long refactor of some core components on the client-side</li>
<li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Launched a major feature: advanced transaction filters</li>
<li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Closed 13 tickets related to feature improvements and bug fixes</li>
<li><strong>Marketing:</strong> Sent out a newsletter outlining the latest new features</li>
<li><strong>Marketing:</strong> This blog post</li>
<li><strong>Marketing:</strong> Added new pages to the marketing site (<a href="https://lunchmoney.app/features/rules">Rules</a> and <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/features/collaboration">Collaboration</a>) and updated the icons in <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/features">Features</a></li>
<li><strong>Support:</strong> Received 239 inbound support tickets and sent out 358 emails</li>
</ul>

<p>What makes all this work bearable for me is the fact that there is so much variety (which, of course, is the spice of life!). I love being able to switch between tasks to keep the job interesting and my mind refreshed while still being productive overall.</p>

<p><em>Case in point: I just finished a major refactor and pushed out 2 major features to beta, so writing this blog post right now feels like a vacation for my brain.</em></p>

<p>To state the obvious, I enjoy being hyper-efficient (without burning myself out, of course). Even though I am a single person, I can still automate, optimize and parallelize processes.</p>



<h2 id="implement-safeguards">Implement safeguards</h2>

<p><i>Ah, the blissful beginnings of Lunch Money when I’d push code directly to production several times a day.</i></p>

<p>At 500+ users now, those days are long gone and I’ve since needed to adopt the more boring but responsible approach of implementing safeguards to prevent shipping faulty code.</p>

<p>For one, <b>I’ve been thoroughly reviewing my own code before every change</b>. Every major feature, improvement and bug fix lives in a feature branch that I still, by habit from the corporate days, prepend with <code>jen/</code>. After verifying everything works great locally, I make sure to take a break first, whether that’s working on a completely unrelated task, going for a meal or going to bed. The point of this is to ensure that I’m code reviewing with a clear head.</p>

<p>While adhering to these standards of code reviewing myself may add extra time to my overall process, it potentially saves hours of bug-fixing, answering related support tickets and self-loathing (I’m half-kidding here) down the line if I accidentally ship bad code.</p>

<center><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New phase of Lunch Money– no more pushing major features straight to production 🤯😂 <a href="https://t.co/RYsz7BnU3L">https://t.co/RYsz7BnU3L</a></p>— Jen (@lunchbag) <a href="https://twitter.com/lunchbag/status/1256987437600927744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 3, 2020</a></blockquote> </center>

<p><b>I also recently implemented an internal beta-testing program open to Lunch Money subscribers.</b> With more users accessing my app on a regular basis, the stakes are higher to ship a version that’s as bug-free as possible.</p>

<p>As an engineering team of one, it’s nearly impossible to always get it right the first time, despite having tests (what if I missed an edge case?) or testing locally extensively (how I think my users will use a feature is not always so).</p>

<p>The beta-testing program has provided some additional benefits. It’s nice to have a cohort of users with whom I can have a more candid conversation about Lunch Money and it’s also a great way to show users that their feedback is valued!</p>

<h2 id="automate-later-than-you-need-to">Automate later than you need to</h2>

<p>While automating tasks can save a lot of time in the long-term, it doesn’t always make sense to automate right off the bat.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/is_it_worth_the_time.png"><span>Obligatory XKCD comic (<a href="https://xkcd.com/1205/" target="_blank">link</a>)</span></p>

<p>Automating too late is not a bad thing. I’ll have done the manual work enough times to understand how to eventually automate the task and what edge cases to look out for. I equate it to doing a job yourself before hiring someone– it’s always better to grok the requirements first to some degree so you can understand how to best utilize who you’ve brought on (and appreciate them more!).</p>

<p>I manually triggered the emails for bi-monthly account summaries for months because I wasn’t confident the sending cadence was reasonable. After observing open rates and collecting user feedback, these are now automated to go out on the 5th &amp; 25th of every month.</p>

<p>Something that I’m glad I didn’t spend the time to automate at all was the referral program. If an existing user refers a new user and the new user subscribes to a plan, then both users will receive credit for 1 month.</p>

<p>In the end, the referral program only brought on 11 extra users. It was not a pain at all to manually process rewards for those who did. If I had spent time conjuring up all the edge cases and automating this process, it would not have been worth the time investment.</p>

<h2 id="keep-low-hanging-fruits-in-the-back-pocket">Keep low-hanging fruits in the back pocket</h2>

<p>In my task management system, I use a tag (🍏) to denote which tasks are low-hanging fruits. For the uninitiated, low-hanging fruits are quick tasks that are easy to knock out, such as one-liners or 5-minute fixes.</p>

<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/YP1Jb0JNc7kqFDbdjm/giphy.gif"></p>

<p>I find that keeping these around and tackling them on days when you feel generally unmotivated can really help raise spirits. Still being able to get something completed and shipped is a great way to get out of a slump.</p>



<h2 id="timing-marketing-pushes">Timing marketing pushes</h2>

<p>At Lunch Money, a big part of the business is using the services of Plaid for bank syncing. Plaid charges on a monthly basis which means that if a user signs up on April 30, connects a bank account immediately and doesn’t end up subscribing at the end of their 14-day trial, they will charge me for this user in both April &amp; May’s invoices.</p>

<p>This realization coupled with my intense aversion to paying more than I need to has shaped a lot of practices at Lunch Money.</p>

<p>For one, the data retention policy used to be 30 days which means if your trial ends and you didn’t put in your billing information, your data will be deleted in 30 days. This certainly guarantees that I’ll be overpaying for churned users and is the reason why the data retention policy has since been revised to 5 days.</p>

<p>In total, a user who does not end up subscribing can spend up to 26 days in the Lunch Money system. This comprises of a 14-day trial, the potential for a 1 week trial extension and a 5 day grace period. Assuming enough users connect their bank accounts, the best way to minimize my costs for churned users is to ensure their lifetimes are within one calendar month.</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/calendar-1.png"></p>

<p>As a result, I always schedule marketing pushes such as blog posts and product launches in the first few days of the month. When I came to this realization, my next Plaid bill went down for the first time.</p>

<h2 id="merging-marketing-and-engineering-for-a-combo-win">Merging marketing and engineering for a combo win</h2>

<p>Taking this a step further, the perk of having a spike in new users is that their trial periods more-or-less overlap. Usually when a new user signs up, they will poke around the product and maybe send in a bug report, a feature request or another piece of feedback. If I reply and address their feedback by putting in a fix or shipping their requested feature within days, more often than not, they end up converting into a happy customer.</p>

<p>I’ve therefore identified the following cycle to maximize potential conversions from spikes in user signups:</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/gantt-2.png"></p>

<p>After a marketing push, let’s say a product launch, I will see an immediate increase in signups lasting about 3 days and then slowly trailing off.</p>

<p>Over the next few days, I’ll start hearing from these new users via support tickets. I prioritize responding to them and I get to work. Showing these users that I’m committed to improving Lunch Money based on their feedback is a great and honest sales tactic.</p>

<p>About 3 days before the initial wave of user trials ends, I wrap up my engineering sprint and send out a newsletter detailing the latest features and improvements. This re-enforces to new users that the product is under continuous development.</p>

<p>Finally, I have a drip campaign that automatically notifies users a few days before their trial expires and on the actual date of expiry. This period of time is when I typically see most users convert 🤞.</p>



<p>I used to think that if I were to hire someone, it would first be a customer support agent but I’ve since been moving away from that idea. Users are constantly surprised (in a good way!) when they realize the founder is responding to their bug reports or feature requests directly.</p>

<p><strong>Consistently providing great customer support is a long-term investment for Lunch Money</strong> as it is undoubtedly a great way to turn customers into champions. As I receive and respond to support tickets, I’m also able to identify and overhaul the common sources of trouble for users.</p>

<p>I’ve always believed that customer support would be the most important and the hardest part of the business to scale, especially if I have the goal of staying a company of one.</p>

<p>Corroborating data from <a href="https://emailmeter.com/">EmailMeter</a> and my database, it seems my changes are making a difference. Despite a growing user base, inbound support emails remain fairly steady!</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/screen-shot-2020-05-21-at-4-20-15-pm.png"><span>Handling support on my own should be sustainable at least for the foreseeable future!</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" id="content">By  · <span itemprop="datePublished" content="2020-07-08">Jul 8, 2020</span> · 8 minute read<div><article itemprop="articleBody" id="content"><p>Today I noticed <a href="https://reddit.com/">New Reddit</a> was asking to use DRM. So I went on a source code analysis journey! See the <a href="https://smitop.com/post/reddit-whiteops.md">main post</a> for more details.</p><p>It appears Reddit uses <a href="https://whiteops.com/">White Ops</a> for fingerprinting and ad fraud prevention (but only sometimes, I think it’s an A/B test). See this beautified code:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>const</span> <span>t</span> <span>=</span> <span>e</span>.<span>user</span>.<span>account</span> <span>?</span> <span>Jt</span>()(<span>e</span>.<span>user</span>.<span>account</span>.<span>id</span>).<span>toString</span>() <span>:</span> <span>void</span> <span>0</span>,
    <span>s</span> <span>=</span> document.<span>createElement</span>(<span>"script"</span>);
<span>s</span>.<span>src</span> <span>=</span> Object(<span>es</span>.<span>a</span>)(<span>"https://s.udkcrj.com/ag/386183/clear.js"</span>, {
    <span>dt</span><span>:</span> <span>"3861831591810830724000"</span>,
    <span>pd</span><span>:</span> <span>"acc"</span>,

    <span>si</span><span>:</span> <span>"d2x"</span>
}), document.<span>head</span>.<span>appendChild</span>(<span>s</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>This code is only run if the <code>show_white_ops</code> feature flag is enabled (don’t know how to force this to be true), which is why I assume the tracking is done by <a href="https://www.whiteops.com/">WhiteOps</a>.
Further research into the <code>https://s.udkcrj.com/ag/386183/clear.js</code> file reveals that it ends up loading another script, <code>https://s.udkcrj.com/2/4.71.0/main.js</code>. For reference, here is <a href="https://smitop.com/whiteops-main.js">the beautified source code I saw and analyzed</a>.</p><p>Note: here is a function I used to deobfuscate many strings in the code:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>const</span> <span>deob</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span> =&gt; <span>x</span>.<span>replace</span>(<span>/[A-Za-z]/g</span>, <span>function</span>(<span>e</span>) {

})
</code></pre></div><p>Note 2: Ozoki appears to be some sort of internal codename used by WhiteOps.</p><p>This very obfuscated script does many things, including (this is an incomplete list, I have missed many things):</p><ul><li>Communicates with <code>vprza.com</code> and <code>minkatu.com</code></li><li>Does device/OS detection</li><li>Attempts to detect if DevTools is open (looks at <code>__IE_DEVTOOLBAR_CONSOLE_COMMAND_LINE</code>)</li><li>Something weird with the <code>text-underline-offset</code> CSS property</li><li>Has the names of a bunch of ad servers, presumably as to not serve ads to bots</li><li>Attempts to create an <code>ActiveXObject</code> (only exists in old IE versions), and checks if the created ActiveX object <code>isSandboxed</code></li><li>Checks for <code>maxConnectionsPerServer</code> and <code>onhelp</code> properties on <code>window</code> (for browser engine detection I think)</li><li>Attempts to exploit an IE11 vuln!<ul><li>it checks the value of <code>document.documentMode</code>, which in IE11 is <code>11</code>. If it is, then it runs the obfuscated code:</li></ul></li></ul><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>// o == document.documentMode == 11

})
</code></pre></div><ul><li>this evaluates to <code>res://ieframe.dll/acr.js</code>, but only on IE. This string has only one purpose, exploiting the fact that you can put arbitrary HTML in the hash part of the URL and have it get evaluated, I beleive in a privledged context of some sort.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p><em>This post is the second in a four-part blog series by Peter Zaitsev, Percona Chief Executive Officer.</em></p>
<p>In this series, we are talking about Linux performance measurement, how to measure it right. Linux performance is a very broad topic, so we’ll focus on the four primary resources which are typically going to drive your system performance – obviously CPU, memory, disk storage, and network.</p>
<p>Other parts in this series include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ma.ttias.be/how-to-measure-linux-performance-avoiding-most-typical-mistakes-cpu/">Measuring Linux Performance: CPU</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ma.ttias.be/how-to-measure-linux-performance-avoiding-most-typical-mistakes-disk-storage/">Measuring Linux Performance: Disk</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ma.ttias.be/how-to-measure-linux-performance-avoiding-most-typical-mistakes-memory/">Measuring Linux Performance: Memory</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ma.ttias.be/how-to-measure-linux-performance-avoiding-most-typical-mistakes-network/">Measuring Linux Performance: Network</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of the disk, there are actually two things you have to take care of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disk space</strong> – simple, right? You don’t want to run out of disk space.</li>
<li>And disk as <strong>I/O performance</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="disk-space">Disk Space</h2>
<p>Starting from the simple tool – disk space.</p>
<p>I see a lot of people who do not understand the difference between size, the file length, and the disk usage. So, in this case, I created a test file of 16 gigabytes, but if you look at <code>du</code>, it only takes 4 kilobytes, because that is a sparse file, which is one giant 16-gigabyte hole.</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://ma.ttias.be/content/measuring-linux-performance/part-2/image1.jpg" alt="Example of disk size/filesize" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>Of course, you’re not likely to see this kind of a difference in the real world but you can, because there are a number of systems using sparse files for different things.</p>
<p>For example, in MySQL, due to some of the table compression that is used there may be a big difference between disk space used vs. file length that may be substantially different.</p>
<h2 id="io-performance">I/O performance</h2>
<p>Now when you speak about the disk I/O performance standpoint, you need to consider a number of things here.</p>
<p>Obviously, there is <strong>IOPS</strong> - how much it can do in the bandwidth. They are not quite replaceable, both can be the bottleneck, especially when it comes to the network-attached storage or slower buses. For example, it can be noticed that all SATA SSDs exactly deliver 500 megabytes a second because the SSDs are so fast, but SATA buses are so slow in this case, so that is the limit out there.</p>
<p>You also need to understand <strong>the different types of loads the disk reads, writes, or fsyncs</strong> , because we do have different latency and load implication.</p>
<p>In addition, your load concurrency is often referred to as a <strong>Queue Depth</strong> when it comes to the disk because concurrency is how many requests the system can process in parallel when big throughput is achieved that it is actually typical.</p>
<p>So, from typical mistakes: <em>“My Iostat Disk Utilization number has reached 100%"</em>. I have seen so many times this kind of being so much scared about this 100% when <em>“there is no way to go! Oh my gosh!"</em></p>
<p>The reality is that your <code>iostat</code> utilization number <strong>means the percent of the time when at least one I/O request was outstanding</strong>. It may make sense again for a single spinning drive in the last decade or last millennia, but it doesn’t really make sense for common storage we use those days.</p>
<p>It does not make sense for SSDs, it doesn’t make sense for RAIDs, it doesn’t make sense for NAS, it doesn’t make sense for cloud storage because they are very good at processing multiple requests at a time.</p>
<p>Performance, the latency at least, would not be impacted.</p>
<p>The points that should be highlighted here:</p>
<h3 id="1-separating-read-and-write-latency">1. Separating read and write latency</h3>
<p>Depending on your system, the difference between read and write latency may be very significant. Some systems actually have varied read latency, some have better write latency. In this case, what I do is compare their current latency to their kind of average latency, which you’ve seen on this system over the last period of time, so I can understand relatively easily that it’s abnormal.</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://ma.ttias.be/content/measuring-linux-performance/part-2/image2.png" alt="Disk I/O latency" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p><em>Comparing Current Latency to Historic Latency can help to see when the latency is abnormal</em></p>
<h3 id="2-the-disk-load-that-also-can-be-the-average-disk-use">2. The disk load, that also can be the average disk use</h3>
<p>It means how many requests are going on at the same time. Because if you’re really saturating your disks, queuing happens, and when this thing typically becomes quite high you should know what exactly your storage is expected to be able to optimally handle.</p>
<p>The problem is of course if you think about cloud storage, you don’t really know what the optimal concurrency is. They don’t tell you and that’s going to be implementation-dependent, which can change at any point any time.</p>

<h3 id="3-biolatency-block-device-latency">3. Biolatency: Block Device Latency</h3>
<p>The next thing is a biolatency, which again you can get from eBPF. You do not need to look at just the average latency, you can look at the distribution which can be done on an I/O device.</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://ma.ttias.be/content/measuring-linux-performance/part-2/image4.png" alt="Block device latency distribution" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>eBPF also has some tools where you can look at that on a file system level that is more interesting because that is where you can also see your cache efficiency as well as you can look at some more of the outliers.</p>
<p>So, this is the tool for ext4 and also one for XFS and some other common file systems.</p>

<![CDATA[A Few Catchy Philosophy Quotes That Are Often Misinterpreted]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<h2>1. "Man is a naturally political animal." - Aristotle (<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0058%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D1253a">Politics, Book 1</a>)</h2>

<h3>What people think it means</h3>

<p>1. People are drawn to "political associations to satisfy their social needs." (<a href="https://oll.libertyfund.org/quotes/164">source</a>), or...</p>
<p>2. People enjoy engaging in the ugly parts of politics, or...</p>
<p>3. People are meant to live in cities. (closest to the actual meaning)</p>

<h3>What it actually means</h3>

<p>To Aristotle, the words "natural" and "political" held special meanings that are not equivalent to what we mean today. The result is that this quote is closer in meaning to:</p>

<blockquote>"Human beings have an internal principle that necessarily leads us to collaboration rather than to independence, and as a result we are meant to live in cities."</blockquote>

<p>When we say "natural" today, we typically mean something that is not man-made. To Aristotle, "natural" refers to things that have a "nature":</p>

<blockquote>"within itself a principle of motion and stability in place, in growth and decay, or in alteration" (Aristotle 192b13)</blockquote>

<p>So when Aristotle says that something is "naturally" the case, through a modern lens he's saying something closer to it being the result of the laws of nature.</p>

<p>Second, by "a political animal," it's tempting to conclude that Aristotle simply means "suited for life in a polis" (city) or "conducive to starting a polis." But he goes on to say that "a human being is <span>more of a</span> political animal than is any bee or any gregarious animal [i.e., an animal that lives in a group]" (1253a8, emphasis mine). So Aristotle thinks that some gregarious animals are political animals, but not to the extent that human beings are. It seems unlikely that Aristotle would suggest that bees or gregarious animals are "suited for lives in a polis" to any degree. More likely, by "political," Aristotle means "working toward a common goal" or "collaborative."</p>

<p>Secular, modern readers would likely disagree with Aristotle's next passage. He argues that nature has "given us" the ability to speak and make moral judgments, and nature "does nothing pointlessly," so we are <span>meant</span> to collaborate on our moral judgments. With our modern understanding of evolution, nature doesn't "give us" features, and nature does sometimes do things "pointlessly." However, this is what Aristotle meant when he said we are "naturally political animals." So even if you agree with the actual meaning of the quote, you probably don't agree with Aristotle's reasoning.</p>

<h2>2. "If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?"</h2>

<h3>What people think it means</h3>

<p>When I hear this quote today, I find that people often use it to mean that even if no one observes a fact, it is still true. So it's used as a rhetorical question, with the answer being "of course it makes a sound!"</p>

<h3>What it actually means</h3>

<p>This quote is not directly from any philosophical text, but the question is derived from "A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge" by the Anglican bishop George Berkeley (namesake of UC Berkeley!). Here's the closest section, where Berkeley explains a counterargument and his response:</p>

<blockquote>"But say you, surely there is nothing easier than to imagine Trees, for instance, in a Park... and no Body by to perceive them. I answer, you may so, there is no difficulty in it: But what is all this, I beseech you, more than framing in your Mind certain Ideas which you call Books and Trees, and the same time omitting to frame the Idea of any one that may perceive them? But do not you your self perceive or think of them all the while?" (<a href="https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~dwilkins/Berkeley/HumanKnowledge/1734/HumKno.pdf">source</a>, pg. 18)</blockquote>

<p>I know that's confusing. Let's break it down. For context, Berkeley's famous phrase "esse est percipi" ("to be is to be perceived") is a summary of his philosophical position that objects as we know them cannot exist without the existence of minds to perceive them. (The gist is that everything we know about the object is known through our minds, so when you remove those characteristics, there's nothing left.)</p>

<p>In the first sentence, Berkeley is paraphrasing an objector who claims they are able to imagine trees that no one is perceiving. But Berkeley points out that the objector is simply thinking of the idea of trees ("certain Ideas which you call Books and Trees"), which only exist because the objector is thinking about them.</p>

<p>Since Berkeley believed in a Christian God, it's not clear whether he thought real objects could possibly exist without any perceiver at all, since God might always be watching. But to a secular reader of Berkeley's arguments, the consequence is that <span>the tree does not make a sound</span>, since sound is a perception, and the existence of a perception depends on the existence of a mind to perceive it.</p>

<h2>3. "God is Dead." (The Gay Science) - Nietzsche</h2>

<h3>What people think it means</h3>

<p>This quote might be interpreted as a proclamation of atheism.</p>

<h3>What it actually means</h3>

<p>Nietzsche presented this phrase to a group of atheists, claiming that it was new information for them. So it can't be a statement about atheism.</p>

<p>In this section of "The Gay Science", Nietzsche discusses how many of the underpinnings of Western society, particularly our moral philosophy, implicitly rely on the concept of God. With the rise of philosophical secularism that came with the Enlightenment, we can no longer rely on God to give life meaning and value, and everything that was built on the Christian faith is destined to "collapse" (GS 343). This is what it means for God to be "dead."</p>

			<p><span>I discovered the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/no/book/show/38714658-the-order-of-time">The Order of Time by Carlo Rovelli</a> a few years ago and it reignited my interest in Quantum Physics. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/24/carlo-rovelli-the-order-of-time-review">This is the original review that reeled me in. </a>The title caught my attention initially because the focus was on the concept of time. Time is a mysterious topic. It changes in unexpected circumstances, it’s perceived in different ways and scientists still ponder what it actually is. It turns out that time and quantum physics go hand in hand. The book is in three sections; the understanding of time in modern physics, what happens without time and finally the latest theories on time including Rovelli’s own research into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity#:~:text=Quantum%20gravity%20(QG)%20is%20a,effects%20of%20gravity%20are%20strong.">Quantum Gravity</a> which present some of the most recent theories in the field. </span></p>
<p><span>One of the intriguing things was the link between time and heat. As things heat up, thermal agitation increases, which leads to entropy and disorder. This can distinguish the past and the future. There are many surprising assertions about time (at least for me) that I won’t spoil for you.</span></p>
<p><span>The tone of this book is poetic. It’s always in awe of the amazing world we live in. The best part is that it simplifies very difficult concepts into something most people could understand, allowing for greater access. This can only be a good thing for technology research overall. </span></p>
<p><span>As much information as there is about the concept of time and the theories that exist, there are still many open questions. It leaves you feeling small, knowing there is so much we don’t know about our world. And finally, unlike most other science books, there’s only one equation mentioned (good news for some).</span></p>
<p><span>I’ll leave you with <a href="https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/wellbeing/carlo-rovelli-coronavirus-italy-life-death-psychology-419679">something recent by Carlo Rovelli talking about the pandemic reminding us we are only human and encouraging collaboration and science to overcome it.</a></span></p>

<p>Thread dump files tend to span for several hundreds of lines (sometimes a few thousands of lines). It is hard to conceive and assimilate all the information in the thread dump due to its verbosity. Flame Graph generated by <span><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fastthread.io/" target="_blank">fastThread</a></span> tool condenses all the information into one single compact flame graph format. It facilitates you to identify hot code paths quickly. In this article, let us learn how to use flame graphs generated by fastThread tool for effective debugging/troubleshooting purposes.</p>



<pre>If you would like to learn how to generate flame graph from java thread dumps, you can refer <a href="https://blog.fastthread.io/2020/06/23/flame-graph-from-java-thread-dump/">to this article</a></pre>



<h2>fastThread Flame graph features</h2>

<p><span><iframe width="736" height="414" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lLVOzy3gERM?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span></p>
</div></figure>



<p>Here are key features of the flame graph generated by fastThread application:</p>



<h3>1. Information on Mouse Hover:&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Stack traces are represented as a column of boxes, where each box represents a function (a stack frame). On mouse-over of boxes, a tooltip will be displayed. It will show the class name, method name, and line of the code that has been executed. More importantly, it will show the number of threads that are executing this line of code.</p>



<p><em><strong>Example:</strong></em><strong><em>&nbsp; </em></strong></p>



<pre><code>com.buggycompany.framework.concurrent.buyggycompanyCallable.call(buggycompanyCallable.java:82), thread count: 2467)</code></pre>

<p><strong><em>Fig: Hovering mouse generates tool tip indicating line of code that is executed</em></strong></p>



<h3>2. Flame Graph Color</h3>



<p>The background color for each box is not significant and is picked at random to be a warm hue. This randomness helps the eye to differentiate boxes, especially for adjacent thin “towers”.</p>



<h3>3. Box width</h3>



<p>The width of each box depends on the thread count. If the width of the box is sufficient, it displays the full function name. If not, either a truncated function name with an ellipsis is shown, or nothing.</p>



<h3>4. Click to zoom</h3>



<p>When a box is clicked, the flame graph zooms horizontally. This reveals more detail and often function names for the child functions.&nbsp;</p>

<![CDATA[Moving from TypeScript to Rust / WebAssembly]]>

<br/>
July 8, 2020 | https://nicolodavis.com/blog/typescript-to-rust/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://nicolodavis.com/blog/typescript-to-rust/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently decided to switch the engine of
<a href="https://boardgamelab.app/">Boardgame Lab</a> from TypeScript
to Rust. The application itself is an SPA written in Svelte.
I only switched the logic that updates the game state to Rust.
Here is a summary of my experience with the transition:</p><h2>Isomorphic Architecture</h2><p>One of the advantages of using JavaScript or TypeScript is
that you can run the same code on both client and server.
For <a href="https://boardgamelab.app/">Boardgame Lab</a>, this means
that the game state can be updated independently on both sides.
This results in a lag-free experience on the client
while still using the server as the authoritative source of
data.</p><p>With <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> taking off, you can get the same advantage
writing Rust. Instead of pushing client-side code to the server, we push server-side code to the client by compiling Rust
to WebAssembly.</p><p>This <a href="https://github.com/wasm-tool/rollup-plugin-rust">Rollup</a>
plugin allows you to import a <em>Cargo.toml</em> file into your
TypeScript codebase, allowing a seamless integration between
Rust and TypeScript code. The dev experience is almost as smooth
as writing TypeScript itself (for example, the browser refreshes
automatically when you change a line of Rust code).</p><p><a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen">wasm-bindgen</a>
facilitates serialization of Rust structs into JSON objects
and vice-versa.</p><h2>Limitations of TypeScript</h2><p>Coding in TypeScript has been a largely pleasant experience,
but switching to Rust immediately brought to light some of the
limitations of TypeScript.</p><h4>Strict Typing</h4><p>TypeScript is more of a type-hinter than a type-checker.
It primarily ensures that you’re not accessing fields that
you aren’t declaring via the type system (which is quite expressive). It also enables nicer autocomplete for your IDE.</p><p>However, it does not actually ensure that the data you are
manipulating corresponds to the type that you have declared
to represent it. For example, the data might contain <strong>additional fields</strong> or
even <strong>incorrect</strong> values for declared types.</p><h4>Data Validation</h4><p>You have to write data validation code to ensure that you’re
operating on correct data in TypeScript. You get this for
free in Rust, which will throw an error if you parse data
that doesn’t line up with the struct that is to hold it in
memory.</p><h4>Error Handling</h4><p>Rust’s <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-02-match.html">pattern matching</a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html">error handling</a> make it easy to
handle every code path that could result in an error, leading
to very robust code.</p><p>This leads to a great degree of confidence that if it compiles,
it’s probably not going to throw an error at runtime.</p><h2>Performance</h2><h4>WebAssembly is faster than JavaScript</h4><p>The initial rewrite without any performance optimizations
is already faster than the previous TypeScript codebase.
This doesn’t matter too much yet, but
<a href="https://boardgamelab.app/">Boardgame Lab</a> will eventually
ship with bots, so the performance will matter once
game trees need to be searched.</p><h4>The Rust server is leaner</h4><p>The multiplayer server receives updates from clients via
WebSockets and then:</p><ul><li>Updates its copy of the game state.</li><li>Broadcasts the client update to other clients.</li></ul><p>The previous server used <a href="https://github.com/websockets/ws">ws</a>, a popular library for NodeJS. The new version uses <a href="https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp">Warp</a> (Rust), which uses less memory
under the same load.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Overall, I’m pretty happy with the switch. I haven’t really
encountered much resistance from the borrow checker despite
being fairly new to Rust (I come from a C++ background, so
maybe that helps).</p></div></div>]]>

<p>In a palm-fringed, sunny bay in Panama, a revolution is taking place. This is the location of the first SeaPod manufacturing facility, where around 30 single family SeaPods are being pieced together from 3D-printed molds and lifted onto their foundations just over a kilometre from the shoreline.</p>
<p>The plan is that these will be self-sufficient homes that power themselves, produce their own hydroponic food and electricity, handle their own wastewater treatment, and even be fitted with an underwater coral nursery to support marine life. Air and water drones will courier trash, recycling, packages, food delivery and emergency medical support like defibrillators and medicine.</p>
<p>This is not science-fiction. If all goes ahead, by late Fall this year, Linton Bay Marina in Panama will house the first residential seasteading community in the world. </p>
<p>Seasteading, the concept of creating permanent dwellings at sea outside the territory claimed by any government, is not new, but some examples more credible than others. For instance, in the 1960's the founder of The Church of Scientology based much of the group's executive leadership on seasteads, before moving them back to land in the 1970's. In his 1992 book <em>The Millennial Project; Colonizing the Galaxy in Eight Easy Steps,</em> <a title="Marshall Savage" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Savage">Marshall Savage</a> discussed building tethered <a title="Artificial island" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_island">artificial islands.</a>  </p>

<p>Artisanopolis concept for the Seasteading Institute (c) Gabriel Scheare, Luke Lourdes Crowley and Patrick White</p>
<p>But recently the concept has gained traction with a more serious school of thought. In April 2019, the concept of floating cities as a way to cope with rising oceans was included in a presentation by the United Nations program UN-Habitat. In addition, a Dutch pro-choice non-profit named <a href="https://www.womenonwaves.org/en/">Women on Waves</a> uses seasteading as a way to circumnavigate abortion laws, using a commissioned ship that contains a specially constructed mobile clinic, the A-Portable. When WoW visits a country, women make appointments for an abortion or other reproductive health service, and are taken on board the ship. The ship then sails out approximately 12 miles to international waters where Dutch laws are in effect on board ships registered in the Netherlands.<sup id="cite_ref-5"></sup></p>
<p>This particular seastead in Panama is the brainchild of <a href="https://ocean.builders/about/">Ocean Builders</a>, a company co-founded by Silicon Valley bitcoin entrepreneur Chad Elwartowski, former Navy aeronautical engineer Rüdiger Koch and software developer Grant Romundt. This is not the first attempt at creating a long-term residential community. It came close, last year, when Elwartowski and his partner Supranee Thepdet moved into the first floating, octagonal seastead 12 miles off the coast of Phuket, Thailand.</p>
<p>They lived there for around two months, but after a video of them drinking champagne and inviting others to "join their ocean community" was published online, the Royal Thai Navy sent out a crew to remove their seastead as "a threat to Thai sovereignty". Elwartowski and his partner had already fled after a tip-off from a friend. </p>
<p>Two years prior, a floating island building company called <a href="https://www.blue-frontiers.com/en/">Blue Frontiers,</a> had signed a memorandum of understanding with French Polynesia to create the first semi-autonomous "seazone" for a prototype in 2017, not least on the grounds of fast-rising sea-levels as a potential life-line to hedge against global warming. But the project was later shelved indefinitely after local protests. </p>

<p>The seastead that was home to Chad Elwartowski and his partner Supranee Thepdet</p>
<p>This time, in Panama, they have the full support of the government, says Ocean Builders CEO Grant Romundt, over a Zoom call. "We will be working closely with Panama to identify any legal matters related to our floating homes. We wish to pursue a flagging system so that owners of the homes can hold a title and claim ownership of their new home fully backed by the legal system of Panama."</p>
<p>An advertisement on the Ocean Builders website is recruiting people to join the growing community, “entrepreneurs, aquapreneurs, technology enthusiasts, electronics hackers, marine biologists and other people that are passionate about developing new products and services that a city on the ocean would need.” </p>
<p>The 3D printer they are using to create the molds for the homes is huge, 20 feet by 16 feet, to build details down to the millimeter. The current pod design is engineered for 5 meter waves as the pods float about 2.5 meters above the waves, similar to an oil rig. The design for the SeaPods came from Dutch architect Koen Olthuis of Water Studio, an established designer of floating homes. </p>
<p>"We really don't feel waves like a normal boat would which is floating in the turbulent surface of the water, and when we go further out to sea we can scale our designs to withstand larger waves," says Romundt. Ocean Builders is working towards 3D printing the entire floating home which may take years of research and development. In the meantime, SeaPods are molded from 3D printed molds in a combination of plastic and foam and then covered with fiberglass. The Pods have an outer shell made of a white gel coat. On the interior, owners can choose between gel coat or a Corian artificial stone surface from Dupont.</p>
<p>During the first phase of sales, according to Romundt, the primary focus will be on tourism and businesses, through 'SeaBnBs', time shares and rentals. "We want as many people to experience our new homes as possible," he adds. </p>
<p><img height="501" width="890" src="https://www.bllnr.com/images/cache/86199cf33beb4e1e21cb4a752200ef37_w890.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Legalities</strong></p>
<p>Every land-based country has their own rules on how long they consider a person needs to be in their country to be deemed a resident of their country, either for legal, tax, health insurance or other purposes. But seasteading countries would be free of that obligation, said Romundt. "There is no requirement for how long someone would need to live on a seastead to be deemed a resident of that community." </p>
<p>To be considered as a country, a seasteading community would likely fly a maritime flag of a country similar to how boats are flagged under a country. This would give them some legal protections as they would theoretically be seen as a part of the country they are flagged under, explained Romundt. To be completely outside of a governments' jurisdiction a seasteading community would need to be 200 miles from land.</p>
<p>According to the non-profit think tank, the Seasteading Institute, many seasteading proponents are fed up with their country's outdated laws and welcome the idea to rewrite the rulebook for the 21st Century. </p>
<p>"The challenge with old governments is that obsolete laws don’t go away as fast as new laws are created. For instance, <a href="https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2016/Bills/A9999/5169_I1.HTM" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">a law that all horses on the highway must wear sleigh bells was not repealed in New Jersey until 2017</a>," said President of the Seasteading Institute, Joe Quirk.</p>
<p>"We need legal systems to evolve as rapidly as the cultures and technologies they govern, and Seasteading is a technology to accelerate the process by which smart laws are developed and dumb laws are deleted. Special Economic Zones are areas within existing countries that are given unique regulatory systems to increase prosperity. Think of them as legal islands created on land. <a href="https://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/wir2019_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">There are more than 4000 around the world, including more than 250 in the US</a>," he added. </p>
<p>Tom W. Bell, a professor of law at Chapman University, wrote a book proposing a new kind of Special Economic Zone known as a SeaZone, which will take the lessons learned from land-based zones and apply them in a floating zone. He said in the book, "Governments across the globe have begun evolving from lumbering bureaucracies into smaller, more agile special jurisdictions - common-interest developments, special economic zones, and proprietary cites. Private providers increasingly deliver services that political authorities formerly monopolized, inspiring greater competition and efficiency, to the satisfaction of citizens-qua-consumers. These trends suggest that new networks of special jurisdictions will soon surpass nation states in the same way that networked computers replaced mainframes."</p>
<p>While this is all good in an ideal, libertarian world, argues Emma Lindsay, a New York-based partner at international law firm Withers, escaping the nation state is difficult, even on the high seas, and in fact the laws of several countries could apply.  </p>
<p>She adds: "<span lang="EN-US">Individuals are subject to the laws of their state(s) of nationality no matter where they are. While not all of a state’s laws apply outside its territory, many do. The laws of the flag state of the seastead also apply.  All seagoing vessels are registered or licensed in a flag state which is deemed the nationality of the vessel. Panama is the world’s largest flag state by far.  Seasteaders also could be subject to the laws of any state that is harmed by their activities at sea, such as by pollution of surrounding waters. The current negotiation of a new UN treaty on conservation and sustainable use of the high seas has increased attention globally on this issue."</span></p>
<p>Withers is advising High Seas Alliance in its advocacy with states and other stakeholders negotiating the new treaty in New York.</p>

<p> <strong>Life In A Tax Haven</strong></p>
<p>The homes in Panama will be located in an anchorage close to a marina in calm, protected waters, as part of a trial run for a community further away in future. This allows for getting accustomed to living on the water while still being able to travel on land having easy access to groceries, supplies and the airport. Each home will be fitted with solar panels, a water filtration system and hydroponic farming to aim for as much self-sufficiency as possible.</p>
<p>One reason for trialling the concept in Panama is that it is a pure tax haven, meaning that it imposes no income, corporate, …</p></div></div>

It doesn’t have a sharp blade, an open flame, or jagged shrapnel. And it’s not dangerous because a bright orange sign proclaimed it so; but precisely the opposite. <em>Invisible</em> goes under the radar and over our heads, engaging no defenses and no fight-or-flight moment.</p><p id="viewer-3emtj">Because <em>invisible</em> doesn’t invoke urgency, less visible matters naturally seem distant, even nonexistent. What’ll get first dibs on my attention — the Amazon rainforest burning for months on end, or the candle burning in my living room? Probably the candle; not because it’s more <em>important</em> than the rainforest, but because it’s more readily <em>visible</em>.</p><p id="viewer-8hggc"><span>Visibility almost never exists on a level playing field. Why is SkyMall staring you in the face on a long flight? And why is Starbucks conveniently placed on the morning-commute-heavy side of the road? Particularly in commercial spaces, what you </span><em>see </em><span>is rarely coincidence. At any given moment, more than a few brands bid fiercely for your eyes — whether via the “</span><a href="https://www.cstoreproductsonline.com/general-merchandise/hitting-consumer-strike-zone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strike zone</a><span>” of convenience store shelves, the head of your search results, or slices of your Instagram timeline. So visibility becomes a point of leverage for those with capital —</span><strong>a differentiator between </strong><em><strong>winners </strong></em><strong>and </strong><em><strong>losers</strong></em><span>.</span></p><div id="viewer-vfg6"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.home.vujade.world/post/out-of-sight-out-of-mind" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_907433be8cb24d2a96f9f8be149bdaaf~mv2.jpeg/v1/fit/w_400,h_353,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_907433be8cb24d2a96f9f8be149bdaaf~mv2.jpeg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpeg"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 01-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 010-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 01-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 01-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 01.283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 010 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-ads28"><a href="http://www.joehollier.com/fiveonthat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></p><p id="viewer-e7ps3">Let’s rewind back to the candle and the rainforest. Who’s the winner there? For starters, it’s the company that sold me the candle. And as winners, they’re inclined to preserve the conditions that let them win. So the immense supply chain that turned crude oil, glass, and paper into a delightful candle (probably clearcutting a rainforest along the way) is deliberately made opaque to regulators and consumers like me. In other words, the <em>box</em> is kept <em>black</em>. With diminished visibility, the loser — the rainforest — is subject to further disadvantage. Thus, <strong>the black box preserves the existing divide between winners and losers.</strong></p><p id="viewer-fq9n4">But if you look a little closer, the winner-loser divide isn’t so black and white. Obviously I, as the owner of the candle, benefit from its black-boxedness. I can fill my living room with citrus blossom fragrances, blissfully ignorant of the polluted air it sends into the lungs of people and animals closer to the candle’s production. And though I may claim to support ecological policy reform, thereby aligning with the loser, my consumption choices say otherwise.</p><div id="viewer-602v0"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.home.vujade.world/post/out-of-sight-out-of-mind" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_83100eafdb1a4ead944746138bb13165~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_600,h_316,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_83100eafdb1a4ead944746138bb13165~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 01-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 010-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 01-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 01-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 01.283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 010 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-9pmb0"><a href="http://www.joehollier.com/fiveonthat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></p><h2 id="viewer-amq0v">Defense mechanisms</h2><p id="viewer-blqmb">Cognitive dissonance is inescapable in a world of black boxes. While they’re often vital to societal functioning — like the black box of democracy, as discussed in <a href="https://vujadeworld.substack.com/p/tangled" target="_blank" rel="noopener">part two</a> — they’re not necessarily moral. Underneath their murky surfaces, we know, are plenty of things we don’t want to see. But since our very lifestyles have molded around them, exposing their inner workings would threaten the way we live. To ward off anxiety and guilt, we construct defense mechanisms (on individual <em>and</em> societal scales).</p><p id="viewer-4nhpg">Take, for example, the moment you dispose of a piece of trash. From the moment it hits the bottom of the bin, a massive system comes to life — of garbage trucks, dumpsters, street cleaners, sanitation centers, and landfills — to whisk it out of your life as quickly as it came in. Or, it just lands on the side of the road…</p><p id="viewer-7h8d">In any case, our products <em>come from</em> and <em>return to</em> a sort of <strong>mental nowhereland</strong>; a cavity for unspoken thoughts to fester: “<em>this doesn’t exist after I’m done with it</em>,” or taken further, “<em>the Earth is abundant</em>.” Of course, these aren’t explicit views in our minds; they occupy the <em>negative space</em> — like shadows, or lies.</p><div id="viewer-a3v8v"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.home.vujade.world/post/out-of-sight-out-of-mind" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_ac3ced2b99534923a938a3d3c2c9b5e5~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1418,h_1418,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_ac3ced2b99534923a938a3d3c2c9b5e5~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 01-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 010-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 01-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 01-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 01.283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 010 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-b0mtt"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BhA8Dhejk9l/?igshid=18a1vwb87761x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></p><p id="viewer-eued3">And this is just for lifeless products.

And as this negative space crystallizes, <em>power</em> is encoded into <em>narrative</em>. <strong>Stories, after all, are the strongest defense mechanisms we have</strong>.</p><h2 id="viewer-bd1j1">The glass slipper</h2><p id="viewer-dnank">If <em>defense mechanisms</em> work best when they’re <em>invisible</em>, and <em>invisible is dangerous</em>, then what does that say about <em>stories</em>? That they’re <em>dangerous</em>? Well, sort of. <strong>Stories are most dangerous when they’re</strong> <em><strong>invisible</strong></em>.</p><p id="viewer-dfbfb">In their refined, packaged-up formats, stories are relatively benign. The danger in Disney fairy tales, for instance, stems from the societal narratives surrounding them — which they subtly reinforce. <em>Cinderella</em>, the movie, isn’t the problem; it’s the broader story of femininity, and the impossible challenge of fitting into the “glass slipper” of male expectations.</p><p id="viewer-63p5o">The symbols and mythology of a story, while potential tools for relaying the real issues at hand, also run the risk of obscuring those same issues. As a result, a story itself can be a sort of glass slipper. Beautiful, yet rigid; prompting conformity under the guise of transparency.</p><div id="viewer-b3cqt"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.home.vujade.world/post/out-of-sight-out-of-mind" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_2f350a6be9ea43bea2bed514c28e560a~mv2.gif/v1/fit/w_500,h_273,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_2f350a6be9ea43bea2bed514c28e560a~mv2.gif"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 01-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 010-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 01-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 01-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 01.283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 010 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-39jn9">Because they’re so easy to perpetuate, stories are the most manipulative of all black boxes. And the protective shell of narrative too often lets injustice off the hook. <strong>If the&nbsp;<em>content</em>&nbsp;of a story doesn’t adequately address its</strong> <strong><em>context</em>, a black box has been formed.</strong> These narrative black boxes, like the prison and the landfill, only reaffirm the conditions that produced them in the first place.</p><p id="viewer-9n9s0">Mark Zuckerberg famously <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Facebook_Effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>: “A squirrel dying in front of your house may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa.” Albeit tone-deaf rhetorically (such as his default to <em>dying</em> and <em>Africa</em>), this is, in fact, a <em>story</em>. And it’s not actually about squirrels, nor people in Africa.</p><p id="viewer-9csne">On the surface-level, it seems reminiscent of the candle/rainforest analogy — illustrating how we naturally prioritize what’s <em>visible</em> over what’s <em>important</em>. But Zuckerberg’s subtext is covertly self-reflexive. Visibility, according to the story, sits outside his locus of control. By focusing on a narrowly-defined “relevance” to our “interests,” he implies that all Facebook does is reflect our own natural tendencies. In a sly erasure of context, the squirrel analogy obscures Facebook’s troll-under-the-bridge role: how levied allotment of visibility is their entire profit model.</p><p id="viewer-dg8pl">If history is written by the victors, then <strong>stories are told by the winners</strong>. So behind every story, and thus behind every black box, there’s a winner. And the BIG winners — like Facebook, Google, and Amazon — not only tell stories, but they run the bidding wars for visibility itself. Space, whether on a shelf or a timeline, is fought for exclusively by those on the <em>outside</em> of the black box.</p><div id="viewer-9pui"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.home.vujade.world/post/out-of-sight-out-of-mind" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_ddef68de436249d8b3a7f9f9b4ab7580~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1382,h_1382,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_ddef68de436249d8b3a7f9f9b4ab7580~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 01-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 010-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 01-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 01-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 01.283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 010 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><h6 id="viewer-9h5iv"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5n1R8XJr83/?igshid=uzunevirh3bo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></h6><p id="viewer-i4hr">But now, the black boxes that have cocooned us for so long are beginning to crack.

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Online abuse of trust is one of the topics I’ve studied deeply, including significant work toward an unfinished <a href="https://levien.com/thesis/thesis.pdf">PhD</a>, and over two years working on a spam and abuse team at Google. These days my main work is on 2D graphics, but seeing patterns of misinformation about Covid-19 is bringing back interest and motivation to think about these topics.</p>

<p>As Covid-19 has been unfolding, I’ve spent significant time and energy trying to understand it, as I tend to do with threats in general. In so doing, I’ve developed some insight on how to tune media consumption patterns towards more truthful content and less misinformation.</p>

<h2 id="america-is-broken">America is broken</h2>

<p>The astonishingly poor national response to Covid-19 is heartbreaking. Given our incredible richness of resources, it is surprising that many of the failure modes resemble those from low-income countries: superstition, cult of personality, suppression of science, and straight up corruption. A common thread is misinformation and disinformation.</p>

<p>Our response to Covid-19 has been very much like driving a car with poorly-maintained brakes. We’ve done the equivalent of neglecting regular maintenance, ignoring the brake light on the dashboard, and choosing to not to pay attention to the squishy feeling of the brake pedal. It’s as if there’s a devil on our shoulder saying, “oh no, don’t get the brakes fixed, it might cost hundreds of dollars.”</p>

<p>I think it’s worth trying to understand <em>why</em> we’re in that position, but it’s beyond the scope of this blog post. Mass behavior of humans is pretty predictable, but individual choices can probably make some difference. I have no answers for those who <em>want</em> to listen to that devil (a big challenge in and of itself), but for those would prefer to listen to the angel instead, I have some tips.</p>

<h2 id="it-is-a-partisan-issue">It is a partisan issue</h2>

<p>I often see the plea “it is not a partisan issue” attached to factual arguments. I think this represents an aspiration: it <em>should</em> not be partisan. In 2020 America, the reality is that there is a powerful anti-science, anti-truth faction, and that faction makes up a large part of the composition of one of the political parties. It’s not 100% alignment, and I want to give credit where credit is due: for example, the moderate Republican governor of Massachusetts has embraced science and investment in public health, and the results in that state are one of the best in the country.</p>

<p>But in general, any factual argument that has bearing on a political question such as “should we invest in public health” or “should we restructure the economy away from carbon consumption” is now inherently partisan.</p>

<p>Much of the partisan content in media is around issues that are not very consequential, either pure entertainment, or (at least traditionally) between candidates or parties that have comparable ability to govern. I was hopeful that the life or death nature of Covid-19 would motivate the people who decide what appears in media to higher standards. But apparently, it’s just the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scorpion_and_the_Frog">nature of the scorpion</a>, they either can’t help themselves or just don’t care. Almost certainly, the media organization with the most blood on its hands is Fox News, which actively promotes an anti-health, pro-infection agenda. I don’t understand how they sleep at night.</p>

<p>Truth threatens a lot of existing power structures. If everybody woke up tomorrow and decided they were tired of being lied to, there would be seismic shifts of power. It’s worth thinking about who might be most affected by such a thing, and the kinds of things they do to keep it from happening.</p>

<h2 id="high-end-science-journalism">High-end science journalism</h2>

<p>I’m going to cover a range of information sources in this post, but there is a tl;dr: read up on actual science journalism by people who know what they’re talking about. Coverage by Science, Nature, and STAT News has been uniformly excellent. Good journalism is always teamwork, but I’ll also raise up the voices of particularly insightful individuals: <a href="https://twitter.com/sciencecohen">Jon Cohen</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kakape">Kai Kupferschmidt</a> of Science, <a href="https://twitter.com/amymaxmen">Amy Maxmen</a> of Nature, <a href="https://twitter.com/HelenBranswell">Helen Branswell</a> of STAT News. These are science journalists who have invested years in honing their craft.</p>

<p>I’ve also been impressed by coverage in The Atlantic. Their science content is quite good (thanks to top-notch contributors such as <a href="https://twitter.com/edyong209">Ed Yong</a>), but they also put the science in the context of American culture and politics. It is for this reason, I believe, that our President has <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2020/05/27/the-atlantic-saw-subscriptions-surge-after-trump-tweet/">singled them out</a> for criticism.</p>

<p>It’s interesting that these sources tend to be publications that have been around for a while (STAT News is a brand of the Boston Globe media group). It’s not exactly rocket science how to do this, you just need to find experienced, capable writers and pay them to do journalism, with editorial and institutional support. But in today’s hyper-capitalist society, sustaining such efforts is a struggle. If you can, try to support publications that do good work by subscribing, or donating in the case of non-profits.</p>

<p>For someone with a limited budget of time and attention, good science journalism is absolutely the best bang for the buck. The other recommendations in this post are for people who want to spend a little more effort to gain, hopefully, a little more insight.</p>

<h2 id="twitter">Twitter</h2>

<p>By far the most interesting experience I’ve had has been Twitter. What makes Twitter unique is its extremely wide dynamic range of information quality: both the worst of the worst and the best of the best are well represented. (An example of an information source of low dynamic range is an encyclopedia: almost every article is pretty good, garbage and brilliance both being rare)</p>

<p>A well-curated Twitter feed is one of the best information sources available today, and following random people on Twitter is one of the worst.</p>

<p>Even though it has no formal structure such as subreddits, Twitter functions as a set of overlapping communities, often described as “X Twitter” or “Y Twitter” (incidentally, a good explanation of how communities work on Twitter can be had in Jeff Jarvis’ <a href="https://buzzmachine.com/2020/05/11/a-conversation-with-nathan-allebach-steak-umms-voice/">interview of the voice behind Steak-umm</a>). There are many experts who generously share their knowledge and thoughts with us, and I’ve found that with a modest investment of time, it’s possible to follow along.</p>

<p>In one of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCud8VIawWp17jKl2Lp0VvlQ">Jeff Jarvis interviews</a>, they jokingly referred to “idiot Twitter,” and, though it was a joke, the concept has stuck with me. Twitter, like all social media properties, works by engaging very large numbers of people with content that appeals emotionally. The expert communities are far too small a fraction of Twitter’s traffic to be profitable for them, but they support them as a way to maintain the prestige of the platform. The replies of any popular post are filled with all manner of conspiracy theory, miracle cure, denial, blame, and, I think at least sometimes, active disinformation by those who would do us harm (it’s hard to tell the difference and the outcome is the same). I think of all that as “idiot Twitter” and just do my best to avoid it. I also see it everywhere, of course, not just Twitter, and the quantity of it is a good measure of the value in a social media platform.</p>

<p>Twitter has a delicate balance to maintain, as there are many aspects of the site design that push you toward “idiot Twitter” even when you’re trying to curate your experience to avoid it. One example that consistently frustrates me is the trending panel, as that seems to be about half composed of idiot Twitter. It’s addictive, even so, because it tempts you with the thrill of discovering things early. I’ve also found that it’s easier to avoid junk on the desktop site than the mobile app. I’m worried the experience will degrade; Quora stands as a cautionary tale of what can happen to a relatively respectable site when they pursue clicks at the cost of all else.</p>

<p>Whether it would be viable to develop a social network designed for quality of discussion is another topic beyond this blog. I’m not especially hopeful on this front, as it’s hard to see how it would be profitable. In any case, there’s not much value in wishing for the possibly impossible, as somebody seeking quality information can find it even today.</p>

<h3 id="list-curation">List curation</h3>

<p>One of the interesting features of Twitter is that people will curate and share lists of people they feel are worth following. My <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1239639611694911489">covid-19 list</a> is one such, and a lot of thought went into it: I’ve intentionally included people with a wide range of expertise (including, for example, <a href="https://twitter.com/j_g_allen">Joseph Allen</a> for his insight into healthy buildings and <a href="https://twitter.com/uche_blackstock">Dr. Uché Blackstock</a> for expertise on health equity). I’ve also deliberately excluded people from this list who express strong political views or often use an emotional tone. Because of the latter criterion, it’s missing people I personally feel are worth listening to, especially <a href="https://twitter.com/gregggonsalves">Gregg Gonsalves</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/JeremyKonyndyk">Jeremy Konyndyk</a>. As always, your mileage may vary. The goal of this particular list is not to be comprehensive, it’s to select a set of voices that have excellent signal to noise ratio; for a much more comprehensive list, see <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1237834151694303234">this one curated by Jeff Jarvis</a>.</p>

<p>One phenomenon I’ve noticed is that people at the top of these lists tend to recommend each other. I wouldn’t be surprised if some automated evaluation (perhaps based on eigenvalues) could yield a good curated list. That said, in my past research, I’ve found that any automatic metric with an incentive will be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">gamed</a>, and invariably will lift up self-promoters over quiet, thoughtful voices.</p>

<p>Speaking of self-promoters, two names do not belong on lists of top experts, but are often found there: Eric Feigl-Ding &amp; Laurie Garrett. Both are good communicators, but are also sloppy enough with their science to get called out regularly. Inclusion of these names is a sign that a list of experts is not especially carefully curated.</p>

<p>Another important warning sign is lack of inclusion of women and people of color; mainstream media is often guilty of this. Health equity is an especially important part of the …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p><em><center>Neil Postman (March 27, 1998)</center></em></p><hr>
      <p>Good morning your Eminences and Excellencies, ladies, and gentlemen. 
      </p><p>The theme of this conference, "The New Technologies and the Human 
      Person: Communicating the Faith in the New Millennium," suggests, of 
      course, that you are concerned about what might happen to faith in the new 
      millennium, as well you should be. In addition to our computers, which are 
      close to having a nervous breakdown in anticipation of the year 2000, 
      there is a great deal of frantic talk about the 21st century and how it 
      will pose for us unique problems of which we know very little but for 
      which, nonetheless, we are supposed to carefully prepare. Everyone seems 
      to worry about this--business people, politicians, educators, as well as 
      theologians. 
      </p><p>At the risk of sounding patronizing, may I try to put everyone's mind 
      at ease? I doubt that the 21st century will pose for us problems that are 
      more stunning, disorienting or complex than those we faced in this 
      century, or the 19th, 18th, 17th, or for that matter, many of the 
      centuries before that. But for those who are excessively nervous about the 
      new millennium, I can provide, right at the start, some good advice about 
      how to confront it. The advice comes from people whom we can trust, and 
      whose thoughtfulness, it's safe to say, exceeds that of President Clinton, 
      Newt Gingrich, or even Bill Gates. Here is what Henry David Thoreau told 
      us: "All our inventions are but improved means to an unimproved end." Here 
      is what Goethe told us: "One should, each day, try to hear a little song, 
      read a good poem, see a fine picture, and, if possible, speak a few 
      reasonable words." Socrates told us: "The unexamined life is not worth 
      living." Rabbi Hillel told us: "What is hateful to thee, do not do to 
      another." And here is the prophet Micah: "What does the Lord require of 
      thee but to do justly, to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy God." And 
      I could say, if we had the time, (although you know it well enough) what 
      Jesus, Isaiah, Mohammad, Spinoza, and Shakespeare told us. It is all the 
      same: There is no escaping from ourselves. The human dilemma is as it has 
      always been, and it is a delusion to believe that the technological 
      changes of our era have rendered irrelevant the wisdom of the ages and the 
      sages. 
      </p><p>Nonetheless, having said this, I know perfectly well that because we do 
      live in a technological age, we have some special problems that Jesus, 
      Hillel, Socrates, and Micah did not and could not speak of. I do not have 
      the wisdom to say what we ought to do about such problems, and so my 
      contribution must confine itself to some things we need to know in order 
      to address the problems. I call my talk <i>Five Things We Need to Know 
      About Technological Change</i>. I base these ideas on my thirty years of 
      studying the history of technological change but I do not think these are 
      academic or esoteric ideas. They are to the sort of things everyone who is 
      concerned with cultural stability and balance should know and I offer them 
      to you in the hope that you will find them useful in thinking about the 
      effects of technology on religious faith. 
      </p><p><b>First Idea</b> 
      </p><p>The first idea is that all technological change is a trade-off. I like 
      to call it a Faustian bargain. Technology giveth and technology taketh 
      away. This means that for every advantage a new technology offers, there 
      is always a corresponding disadvantage. The disadvantage may exceed in 
      importance the advantage, or the advantage may well be worth the cost. 
      Now, this may seem to be a rather obvious idea, but you would be surprised 
      at how many people believe that new technologies are unmixed blessings. 
      You need only think of the enthusiasms with which most people approach 
      their understanding of computers. Ask anyone who knows something about 
      computers to talk about them, and you will find that they will, 
      unabashedly and relentlessly, extol the wonders of computers. You will 
      also find that in most cases they will completely neglect to mention any 
      of the liabilities of computers. This is a dangerous imbalance, since the 
      greater the wonders of a technology, the greater will be its negative 
      consequences. 
      </p><p>Think of the automobile, which for all of its obvious advantages, has 
      poisoned our air, choked our cities, and degraded the beauty of our 
      natural landscape. Or you might reflect on the paradox of medical 
      technology which brings wondrous cures but is, at the same time, a 
      demonstrable cause of certain diseases and disabilities, and has played a 
      significant role in reducing the diagnostic skills of physicians. It is 
      also well to recall that for all of the intellectual and social benefits 
      provided by the printing press, its costs were equally monumental. The 
      printing press gave the Western world prose, but it made poetry into an 
      exotic and elitist form of communication. It gave us inductive science, 
      but it reduced religious sensibility to a form of fanciful superstition. 
      Printing gave us the modern conception of nationhood, but in so doing 
      turned patriotism into a sordid if not lethal emotion. We might even say 
      that the printing of the Bible in vernacular languages introduced the 
      impression that God was an Englishman or a German or a Frenchman--that is 
      to say, printing reduced God to the dimensions of a local potentate. 
      </p><p>Perhaps the best way I can express this idea is to say that the 
      question, "What will a new technology do?" is no more important than the 
      question, "What will a new technology undo?" Indeed, the latter question 
      is more important, precisely because it is asked so infrequently. One 
      might say, then, that a sophisticated perspective on technological change 
      includes one's being skeptical of Utopian and Messianic visions drawn by 
      those who have no sense of history or of the precarious balances on which 
      culture depends. In fact, if it were up to me, I would forbid anyone from 
      talking about the new information technologies unless the person can 
      demonstrate that he or she knows something about the social and psychic 
      effects of the alphabet, the mechanical clock, the printing press, and 
      telegraphy. In other words, knows something about the costs of great 
      technologies. 
      </p><p>Idea Number One, then, is that culture always pays a price for 
      technology. 
      </p><p><b>Second Idea</b> 
      </p><p>This leads to the second idea, which is that the advantages and 
      disadvantages of new technologies are never distributed evenly among the 
      population. This means that every new technology benefits some and harms 
      others. There are even some who are not affected at all. Consider again 
      the case of the printing press in the 16th century, of which Martin Luther 
      said it was "God's highest and extremest act of grace, whereby the 
      business of the gospel is driven forward." By placing the word of God on 
      every Christian's kitchen table, the mass-produced book undermined the 
      authority of the church hierarchy, and hastened the breakup of the Holy 
      Roman See. The Protestants of that time cheered this development. The 
      Catholics were enraged and distraught. Since I am a Jew, had I lived at 
      that time, I probably wouldn't have given a damn one way or another, since 
      it would make no difference whether a pogrom was inspired by Martin Luther 
      or Pope Leo X. Some gain, some lose, a few remain as they were. 
      </p><p>Let us take as another example, television, although here I should add 
      at once that in the case of television there are very few indeed who are 
      not affected in one way or another. In America, where television has taken 
      hold more deeply than anywhere else, there are many people who find it a 
      blessing, not least those who have achieved high-paying, gratifying 
      careers in television as executives, technicians, directors, newscasters 
      and entertainers. On the other hand, and in the long run, television may 
      bring an end to the careers of school teachers since school was an 
      invention of the printing press and must stand or fall on the issue of how 
      much importance the printed word will have in the future. There is no 
      chance, of course, that television will go away but school teachers who 
      are enthusiastic about its presence always call to my mind an image of 
      some turn-of-the-century blacksmith who not only is singing the praises of 
      the automobile but who also believes that his business will be enhanced by 
      it. We know now that his business was not enhanced by it; it was rendered 
      obsolete by it, as perhaps an intelligent blacksmith would have known. 
      </p><p>The questions, then, that are never far from the mind of a person who 
      is knowledgeable about technological change are these: Who specifically 
      benefits from the development of a new technology? Which groups, what type 
      of person, what kind of industry will be favored? And, of course, which 
      groups of people will thereby be harmed? 
      </p><p>These questions should certainly be on our minds when we think about 
      computer technology. There is no doubt that the computer has been and will 
      continue to be advantageous to large-scale organizations like the military 
      or airline companies or banks or tax collecting institutions. And it is 
      equally clear that the computer is now indispensable to high-level </p></div></div>

<p>It’s often said that you can tell a lot about a person by observing their living space. In a similar vein, I believe we can glean a lot about society by observing our own minds – where we store the individual thoughts, beliefs and values that form society’s collective structures. Unsurprisingly our headspace is often a product of our mind’s state, sitting somewhere along a spectrum of fulfilment to boredom at any one time. In this article I want to focus more on the latter, more specifically, how boredom as a pervasive state of mind has shaped our consumption habits. What we feed our minds for entertainment and why.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before I get into that though we have to clarify the relationship between boredom and consumption, or rather dispel a popular myth. Boredom isn’t resolved by quick, easy stimulation of the mind, instead boredom feeds off of it to grow even larger. You can think of it as drinking alcohol to quench thirst, in the immediate term you will feel hydrated only to realise it will leave you even more parched than before. Now that we’ve acknowledged this, bear in mind that today’s pace of life and technology has ensured that we do exactly that. Boredom is met with quick stimulus leaving an even larger craving in its wake, only to be met by quicker and easier stimulation, and so goes the cycle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today’s entertainment economy has adjusted to this fundamental transformation in our consumption habits – I call it a transformation because it has happened slowly but surely over several decades. And while the link isn’t obvious yet, it’s a large part of the reason you’ve been walking out of cinemas thinking “is it just me or were movies better a few years ago”. While I can’t surely say movies were better a few years ago, why, in an increasingly creative, technologically advanced society would viewers be left feeling this way post a movie experience?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The explanation for this lies in, you guessed it, boredom. Also to an extent, discovery and recommender systems but we won’t get into that now. To solve for boredom at scale, we have to appeal to the lowest threshold for stimulation. This objective to appeal to the lowest common denominator for stimulation quickly becomes a defining factor of our consumption habits. When Youtube launched in 2006 later to be acquired by Google, it signalled the start of a shift in consumable entertainment. User-generated entertainment was never before a comparable form of media for the masses. People didn’t watch vlogs and live streams while they ate dinner, they watched old school Tv shows and movies. But Youtube was successful because it was one of the first to address the quantity of entertainment required to “quench” boredom at scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Youtube and subsequent platforms like TikTok are naturally able to provide the lowest common denominator across the board – “there is something for everyone” – with the sheer quantity and diversity of user generated content (UGC) on these platforms. Hollywood movies though, don’t work on the function of quantity. Rather they work on high-quality production and creative output. Hollywood had to address the challenge of vying for eyeball time in an increasingly saturated ‘boredom market’. To do this, Hollywood had to begin considering what platforms like Youtube were doing, providing a quick dopamine hit whilst servicing the lowest common denominators that would attract the most people. Hollywood’s take on this has manifested into today’s mainstream film industry. This takes the form of ‘PG’ movies appealing to younger, broader audiences, through to the one-liners in marvel movies that seem to hit just right.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One other clear example of this is the influx of reboots over the last few years. Here, nostalgia is the common denominator these movies are targeting instead of focusing on the creation of new content. <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens </em>is probably a good example of this, basically a play by play of <em>A New Hope</em> – the first movie in the Star Wars franchise to release in the 1970s.</p>



<h3>How Quibi failed to read the room</h3>



<p>Quibi, Hollywood’s poster child for short-form video content, has been created for a mobile-only audience. It claims it competes with “free” forms of video like Youtube and TikTok that target viewers with time and attention constraints. This offering rests upon the assumption that viewers on current UGC platforms would prefer higher quality production.</p>



<p>If I Imagine the pitch-room for Quibi seed round investment – the pitch would have gone something like this. “We’re time poor/attention-deficit and addicted to the drip-drip release of dopamine that our smart-phones deliver unto us. As our consumption patterns arc away from the past – we are ever in search of easier to consume, easier to enjoy doses that slot into the (apparently) smaller spaces of discretionary time in our lives or minds – Youtube/TikTok have shown how hungry the people are for these short bursts of escape – but user-generated content can’t fill that gap at the scale and quality we can”</p>



<p>What QuiBi failed to understand is that the transformation in our consumption pattern wasn’t about short-form content with high-quality production but about fulfilling the need for stimulus created by boredom. In actual fact, our consumption patterns had fragmented into two formats. The first is “Hollywood” style productions, high-quality story driven content that requires greater cognitive participation (immersion). The second is lower quality production or user-generated content that we equate with easy, effortless consumption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anecdotally, you can abandon a YouTube video halfway and not feel dissatisfied for having wasted five minutes on it – a perk of non-immersive content. Comparatively, it would be difficult to abandon the type of high production content found on Quibi – where you’ve already committed to participating cognitively and are anticipating immersion – without feeling a little cheated of time and effort.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Immersion requires the cognitive expense of dedicating a set amount of time and a certain mindset to consume that content. This cognitive expense is at odds with the youtube or TikTok model, where spontaneous discovery and consumption also equate to spontaneous abandonment of that content without dissatisfaction. If Quibi wanted to replicate the spontaneous discovery and consumption, their focus should have been on scaling quantity that allows for spontaneity rather than spending 100,000 USD per minute of video. Imagine if there were 80,000 or 800,000 pieces of content rather than 8,000?&nbsp;</p>



<p>So then the absurdity of the following statement is apparent:</p>



<p>“We’re competing against free,” Jeffrey Katzenberg says referring to the likes of youtube and social media platforms like TikTok. “We have to offer something that is meaningfully, measurably, quantifiably, creatively different. They don’t know how to do what we do, with all due respect,…”</p>



<h3>Hollywood: Where tried and tested formulas often outweigh the cost of creative risks</h3>



<p>The lowest common denominator is easier to identify on YouTube where stimulus is dictated and served by ‘market’ forces, basically the consumption demands of users. On the other hand, Hollywood relies more heavily on a commercial push strategy informed by the smaller sample set of feedback available in audience scores. The cost of identifying the nature of demand is significantly larger in the latter compared to the throwaway cost of a YouTube production. Producers can easily move from one youtube video to the next without losing an arm and a leg.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The high cost of production in Hollywood doesn’t afford the same luxury, the same applies for Quibi’s production value. This then exacerbates a reliance on more obviously popular tropes, reboots are an easy out given that the particular world, plot or characters are already loved by audiences. This pushes production towards tried and tested formulas which are replicated year on year, where funny one-liners from marvel movies are a hallmark of Hollywood production now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Where optionality was limited in the 90s, early 2000s or any time before to the TV and Cinema, taking punts on new formats, stories or original productions seemed a less risky endeavour. In today’s world, there is far too much optionality and much slimmer margin for error.</p>
