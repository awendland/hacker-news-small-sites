<p>Have you ever wondered which pages people look at once they have landed on your site? How do they navigate? The same questions go for designing a new digital product. How do people click through your prototype? How do they navigate and interact with the designed solution? </p>



<p>If you are conducting a UX study, you can turn to <strong>Useberry </strong>for answers!</p>



<p>In this post, I want to show you a very cool feature called <strong>User Flow.</strong></p>



<p>With Useberry’s <strong>User Flow</strong> report you can learn about the path a visitor takes before reaching its destination while you are in the prototype phase of the design.</p>



<p>But, first things first.<br></p>



<h3>What is User Flow?</h3>



<p>User Flow visualizes the path a user follows from one screen to the next. It helps you understand the behavior of your users, how they interact with your prototype, and create a conversion funnel for it.</p>



<p>In other words, it is a graphical representation of which screens users utilize to complete a specific task, how they move around your prototype, and, most importantly, which screens they’re on when they decide to leave.</p>



<p>Let’s say a user lands on the “Home” screen, goes to the “About” screen, and then to “Contact Us” before leaving.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>The user path would then be <strong>Home -&gt; About -&gt; Contact Us.</strong></p></div>



<h3>Why is this important?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The User Flow report can indicate specific points where testers remained longer or got stuck perhaps and help you make changes to enhance the user experience. The easier testers can navigate through your prototype and complete your task, the happier visitors to your final product they’ll become.</p>



<p>Gaining a deeper understanding of how testers are interacting with your prototype can help you optimize your screens for maximum conversions.</p>



<p>This means that you’ll be able to see if there are any specific screens that made users leave your test/prototype. Once these screens have been recognized and then altered with more appropriate or engaging content, you can go back to the User Flow report to check if the number of drop-offs has declined.</p>



<blockquote><p><em>You know what you want and like, but to be effective in the UX industry you need to understand the desires of your prospective users.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Understanding the preferences of your target audience is the first step in optimizing your design for conversions. Your aim is to make it easy for your target audience to find and purchase your products and services.<br></p>



<p>Here are just a few of the user behaviors you can learn about with the User Flow report:</p>



<ul><li>Which paths do your testers favor?&nbsp;</li><li>Which screens have the highest drop-off rate?</li></ul>







<h2>What do they look like?</h2>



<p>If you are familiar with the Google Analytics User Flows then you have an idea of how complex (or simple) a User Flow might look.</p>

<h2>How to use User Flow Report in Useberry</h2>



<p>Now that you know what User Flow is and why it’s important, let’s see how you can find and use the report in Useberry and in your designs.</p>



<p>The best way to explain something is with an <strong>example</strong>.</p>



<p>So, let’s create a simple prototype of a music app and monitor how our potential users interact with/navigate through it in order to complete a simple task.</p>



<p>In the following example, we have a “simple” scenario.</p>



<p>We asked 10 testers to “<strong>Add a track to their wish list</strong>”.</p>



<p>The path that the users “should” take and where they “should” click in order to complete the task appears in the screenshot.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/expected-path.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/expected-path-1024x267.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/expected-path-1024x267.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/expected-path-300x78.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/expected-path-768x200.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Expected path users must follow to complete the task</figcaption></figure>



<p>The whole prototype that we are using appears in the following screenshot:</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/all-flow.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/all-flow-1024x573.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/all-flow-1024x573.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/all-flow-300x168.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/all-flow-768x430.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>For the purposes of this example, we created the prototype with <strong>Figma</strong> for which we used the <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Useberry plugin (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/788799088384104964/Useberry" target="_blank">Useberry plugin</a></strong>.<br></p>



<p><strong>Let’s start our test:</strong></p>



<p><strong>Task</strong>: Add a track to your favorites list&nbsp;<br><strong>Instructions</strong>: Navigate through the prototype and add a track to your wish list.<br><strong>Type of test:</strong> Single task<br><strong>Number of blocks used in Useberry</strong>: 2 (Single Task, Thank you)<br><strong>Audience</strong>: People from a Facebook group of music fans<br><strong>Number of testers</strong>: 10<br><strong>Time to get back results:</strong> 4 minutes<br><strong>Link to the test</strong>: <a href="https://app.useberry.com/preview/XT84tChQ/">https://app.useberry.com/preview/XT84tChQ/</a><br></p>



<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/test-results.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/test-results.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/test-results.png 865w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/test-results-300x162.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/test-results-768x415.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 865px) 100vw, 865px"></a></figure></div>



<p>OK, we have 60% success in the single task which means that 4 of our users couldn’t complete the task successfully.</p>



<p><strong>But WHY is this the case? </strong></p>



<p><strong>It was so obvious what they had to do, you might think.<br></strong></p>



<p>Let’s focus on the single task now and look at the results:<br></p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/single-task-results.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/single-task-results.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/single-task-results.png 872w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/single-task-results-300x243.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/single-task-results-768x623.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 872px) 100vw, 872px"></a></figure>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/stats.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/stats.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/stats.png 891w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/stats-300x106.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/stats-768x272.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 891px) 100vw, 891px"></a></figure></div>



<p>Ok, we can see that 4 users skipped the task.<br></p>



<p>Now, we have 2 options:</p>



<ul><li>Filter the results and watch the session recording of the specific users</li><li>View the user flow and find the pain area </li></ul>



<p>With 10 testers it’s easy to monitor the session recording of 4 users but <strong>on a larger scale</strong> – what would happen if we had more than 100 users?</p>



<p>So, let’s examine the User Flow in order to better understand what happened.</p>



<p>And the results are…</p>



<p>Lines and Curves.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1024x309.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1024x309.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-300x91.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-768x232.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Useberry’s User Flow of the test</figcaption></figure>



<p>This looks a bit complex (or not!) but let’s analyze it anyhow.</p>



<p>Let’s <strong>zoom in</strong> a little bit and explain what we can see here.</p>



<figure><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-19-at-4.29.52-PM-1024x713.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-19-at-4.29.52-PM-1024x713.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-19-at-4.29.52-PM-300x209.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-19-at-4.29.52-PM-768x535.png 768w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-19-at-4.29.52-PM.png 1106w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Think of the User Flow as a table.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every <strong>cell</strong> is an <strong>incremental navigation</strong> <strong>step</strong> and every <strong>row</strong> is a <strong>screen that appeared</strong> on the specific navigation step.</p>



<p>We then <strong>group unique screens with unique navigation steps</strong> and we create the User Flow.</p>



<p>Next to every screen, you will notice a number, and some screens may have a colored number below them. </p>



<p>The number next to the screen is the number of unique users who landed on the specific screen and the number below the screen is an event. </p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/event-explanation.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/event-explanation.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/event-explanation.png 662w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/event-explanation-300x235.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px"></a></figure></div>



<p>Here at Useberry, we capture 3 different events:</p>



<p><strong>Yellow event (Skip):</strong> Number of users who skipped the task on the specific step.<br><strong>Blue event (Success):</strong> Number of users who completed the task on the specific step.<br><strong>Red event (Drop-off):</strong> Number of users who dropped-off (totally closed) the test on the specific step.</p>







<p>Now, let’s go back to our example and the results that we have obtained.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1-1024x309.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1-1024x309.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1-300x91.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1-768x232.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Click the image to enlarge</figcaption></figure>



<p>In our User Flow example, we can see that we have <strong>multiple paths</strong> that users followed to complete their task.</p>



<p>(In this specific example, we don’t have users that closed the test before it ended which is why we don’t have red events.)</p>



<p>If we look carefully at the User Flow, we realize that we have 4 different screens that have events under them, which means that we have 4 different flows.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flow-with-paths.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flow-with-paths-1024x309.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flow-with-paths-1024x309.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flow-with-paths-300x91.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flow-with-paths-768x232.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>click image to enlarge</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Optimal Path</strong></p>



<p>Clicking the”Optimal path” button we can see the most common flow that users took in order to complete their task.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/optimal.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/optimal-1024x495.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/optimal-1024x495.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/optimal-300x145.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/optimal-768x371.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Optimal path</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Oh, wait…</strong></p>



<p>Those are the users that skipped the task!</p>



<blockquote><p>The “top path” is the most common user flow. It’s the series of screens seen by your typical tester. Every app has one. But not every designer knows what it is.</p></blockquote>



<p>Namely,  4 users took the <strong>exact specific path</strong> and these users skipped the task after they landed on a specific screen.</p>



<p>Bearing in mind the expected path and seeing that the optimal path is not the same as the expected path, we can <strong>quickly</strong> figure out that we need to modify our design in order to increase the success of the test.</p>



<p><strong>Let’s go a little deeper, though</strong>.</p>



<p>If we look carefully at the screen where testers split, we can see that that’s where we need to focus.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/spllited-titles.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/spllited-titles.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/spllited-titles.png 668w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/spllited-titles-274x300.png 274w" sizes="(max-width: 668px) 100vw, 668px"></a><figcaption>Click on the image to enlarge</figcaption></figure>



<p>We have 8 users who landed on <strong>screen A</strong> and 2 users who landed on <strong>screen B</strong>. On our expected path, the <strong>screen B</strong> is the “expected” screen. The users <strong>MUST</strong> go there in order to complete the task. </p>



<p>So, we have two options – change our design in order to lead these 8 users to <strong>screen B</strong> or design “something” on <strong>screen A</strong> to satisfy our users.</p>



<p>Now let’s see where the users clicked and <strong>why they split</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>How?</strong> </p>



<p>Just click “View Heatmaps” on the specific screen.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/splitted-heatmaps-2.png" alt="" width="603" height="680" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/splitted-heatmaps-2.png 603w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/splitted-heatmaps-2-266x300.png 266w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px"><figcaption><br>By clicking heatmaps on a screen you will see where the users clicked when they were on the specific screen and the specific path step</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>And the results are…</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/heatmap-1.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/heatmap-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/heatmap-1.png 400w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/heatmap-1-156x300.png 156w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></a></figure></div>



<p><strong>Aha… Interesting! </strong></p>



<p>It seems that our testers and our potential users, in order to add a track to their wish list, first navigate through the specific track. (makes sense!)</p>



<p>Well, a possible solution to this is to satisfy our users when they land on <strong>screen B</strong>. That’s why we changed the design and added a bar with the “add to wishlist” button on the specific screen and run a new test again.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-solution.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-solution-1024x851.png" alt="" width="580" height="482" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-solution-1024x851.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-solution-300x249.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-solution-768x638.png 768w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-solution.png 1063w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px"></a><figcaption>Before – After</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>Task</strong>: Add a track to your favorite list&nbsp;<br><strong>Instructions</strong>: Navigate through the prototype and add a track to your wish list.<br><strong>Type of test:</strong> Single task<br><strong>Number of blocks used in useberry</strong>: 2 (Single Task, Thank you)<br><strong>Audience</strong>: From a Facebook group of music fans<br><strong>Number of testers</strong>: 10<br><strong>Time to get back results:</strong> 4 minutes<br><strong>Link to the test</strong>: <a href="https://app.useberry.com/preview/hbtk48wW/">https://app.useberry.com/preview/hbtk48wW/</a></p>



<p>And the results of the <strong>new </strong>test are…</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alt-version-results.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alt-version-results.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alt-version-results.png 866w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alt-version-results-300x249.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alt-version-results-768x637.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 866px) 100vw, 866px"></a></figure></div>

<p><strong>Amazing!</strong> We actually increased our conversions!</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>We managed to find an issue in something we thought was obvious and we resolved it quickly with the help of the user-flows. </p>



<p>Running tests in the design phase helps you save time and effort and solve UX issues that never even occurred to you before.</p>



<p>Maybe the results of the test are obvious but this is just a demo and an example in order to explain what user-flow looks like and how it can help you resolve UX issues.</p>



<p>With more complex prototypes and more testers, the user-flow becomes more complex, too, but we are trying to add features to make it as friendly as we possibly can – it’s up to you if you want to dig into it.</p>



<p>So, happy designing and feel free to come forward with any suggestions!</p>

    <div><div><p>The intensification of dairy farming has been a concern of ours for many years, so we’ve been working hard to come up with a different solution. Our big idea? A new method of dairy farming that keeps the calves with their mothers to suckle. Our <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/ethical-dairy-system">ethical dairy model</a> is based around treating the animals, the land, our environment and the people who work here with respect and kindness.</p></div></div>
<div>
  <div><div><div><div about="" typeof="">
  <div>
    <div><div><div><p>In traditional dairy farms calves are removed from their mothers within a few hours of their birth - the stress this places on the cow is clear. So we wanted to find a way to keep calves with the cows and still have a financially viable farm. Put simply, we don’t want to have to choose between doing what’s right and staying in business.</p>
<p>As an organic dairy farm for more than twenty years our cows have already benefitted from some of the highest welfare standards in the UK, but we knew we could do even better. We built a new dairy, specially designed to house calves with their mothers, and we trialled the full cow with calf system for the first time in 2012. It taught us a lot, but financially cost us an awful lot.</p>
<p><span>However, the impact it made on cow contentment was staggering. All the animals were noticeably calmer and far more confident. <span>&nbsp;</span>After two to three months the calves became like teenagers, they loved playing with their pals and really only came back to mum when they wanted food!</span></p>
<p><span></span>We are determined to make our radical new model of dairy farming work, and by purchasing cheese from The Ethical Dairy you are helping to support it.</p>

  <div>
    <div><div><div><p>Since October 2016 our calves have stayed with their mothers for 5 to 6 months. We still milk them in that period, but only once a day.</p>
<p>We are still at the early stages of The Ethical Dairy project, but our new approach to dairy farming has already led to huge reductions in the use of <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/power-nature">antibiotics</a>, increases in <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/biodiversity-ethical-dairy">biodiversity</a> and <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/healthier-winter">healthier</a>, happier cows. Compared to an average dairy farm, already The Ethical Dairy has:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Cut greenhouse gas emissions by more than half</li>
<li>Reduced <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/coo-poo-power">energy</a> use by more than half</li>
<li>Cut <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/power-nature">antibiotic</a> use by 90%</li>
<li>Cut agro-chemical use by 90%</li>
<li>Doubled the productive life of cows</li>
<li>Increased our farm <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/biodiversity-ethical-dairy">biodiversity</a> five-fold</li>
<li>Increased the net amount of food in our <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/politics-food-production">food system</a> by 80%</li>
<li>Exceeded the highest standards of animal welfare</li>
</ul>
<p>The Ethical Dairy has been supported in its journey by many individuals through our crowdfunding campaign in the autumn of 2018, and by public funding, such as Dumfries and Galloway LEADER which is helping us to attend trade shows, events, and to market and promote our products. We are also grateful for support from the Food Processing, Manufacturing and Cooperation grant which has supported the development of our new cheese dairy.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><a href="https://console.dev/">Console</a> is starting as a free weekly newsletter highlighting the best tools for developers. We want to know how our list is performing, which means keeping an eye on some key metrics like active subscribers and unsubscribe rates. We can log into Mailchimp to see this data, but I wanted to get a quick daily update rather than forming a habit of constantly logging in.</p><p>We <a href="https://basecamp.com/guides/group-chat-problems">default to asynchronous communication</a> and use the chat room built into <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a> for informal socialising or posting non-critical links and comments. I check it each morning, so it seemed like a good place to post a status update.</p><p>Like most chat products <a href="https://github.com/basecamp/bc3-api/blob/master/sections/chatbots.md#create-a-line">Basecamp has a bot API</a> to send arbitrary messages into the chat. It is therefore easy to use <a href="https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/docs/fundamentals/">the Mailchimp API</a> to <a href="https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/api/lists/get-list-info/">pull the stats</a> and post them into Basecamp. This code just needs to run every morning.</p><p>Keeping <a href="https://blog.console.dev/console-tech-stack-2021/">our tech stack</a> as simple as possible is a priority. We don't have a complex product and dealing with servers, OS updates, database replication, etc is something we will put off as long as possible! However, a chat bot has to run somewhere. This is the perfect use-case for a serverless function - just write the code and let the platform deal with the infrastructure maintenance.</p><h2 id="azure-vs-google-vs-aws">Azure vs Google vs AWS</h2><p>I have <a href="https://davidmytton.blog/who-has-the-best-serverless-platform/">tried AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Azure Functions</a>, and have several personal utility functions running on both Google and Azure. Whilst I have been impressed with Google Cloud's database products, they are still behind when it comes to the breadth of functionality in their serverless functions product. Google doesn't support Rust and has no concept of custom runtimes like AWS and Azure do.</p><p>This meant it was down to AWS vs Azure. Both have excellent documentation, lots of language SDKs, and a large ecosystem of developers. However, I prefer the Azure web portal, like how they build in public on GitHub, and <a href="https://davidmytton.blog/fighting-over-who-has-the-greenest-public-cloud/">rate them best for environmental sustainability</a>. AWS is the more popular platform and Lambda/Azure Functions are competitive. I just prefer Azure.</p><h2 id="creating-a-python-serverless-bot">Creating a Python serverless bot</h2><p>I have been writing Python for over 10 years, so it was the default choice to create a simple serverless bot. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-python">Azure has native Python support</a>, the Basecamp API takes a simple HTTP POST, and <a href="https://github.com/mailchimp/mailchimp-marketing-python">Mailchimp has an official Python SDK</a>. </p><p>This meant that within a few hours I had written a function, created the Azure Resource Manager template, and configured GitHub Actions to automatically deploy on push. The bot was running and delivering us stats each morning.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/campfire-totorobot-python.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/campfire-totorobot-python.png 600w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/campfire-totorobot-python.png 825w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Python bot posting our daily Mailchimp stats into Basecamp.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="why-port-to-rust">Why port to Rust?</h2><p>Over Christmas I usually leave London to visit my family, however <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-55380644">the change in COVID-19 rules</a> meant that I could no longer leave the city. With some extra time, particularly in the quiet period between Christmas and New Year, I ended up spending several days playing around with <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>.</p><p>Although it has been around since 2010, Rust has become particularly popular in the last few years. <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted">Stack Overflow have listed it as the most loved language</a> since 2016.</p><p>I won't go into the standard Rust pitch of "better safety, concurrency, performance" - you can find detailed Rust <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03382-2">vs</a> Language X <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2015/5/27/rust-for-pythonistas/">posts</a> <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang/rust-vs-go">elsewhere</a> - but I did want to write up my experience as a Rust newbie.</p><h3 id="reason-1-fun-and-interesting">Reason 1: Fun and interesting</h3><p>My main reason for porting from Python to Rust was that it was fun and interesting! I like Python (which sits at #3 in the "most loved" 2020 ranking) because it is easy to start writing code and you can get things done quickly. It also enforces a particular coding style which means more consistent layout, spacing, indenting, etc.</p><p>Python doesn't make you think about concepts like static typing and memory management because it handles it for you. Rust is very different. It forces you to consider types, ensure all return cases are handled consistently, understand scoping, and many other things which are absent in Python. This is by design because it makes the resulting code much more robust.</p><p>Rust uses the concept of "<a href="https://sled.rs/errors">correctness</a>". It's not that Rust is "right" and Python is "wrong", but forcing you think about these concepts, and enforcing them before code will compile, helps to avoid errors:</p><blockquote>almost all (92%) of the catastrophic system failures are the result of incorrect handling of non-fatal errors explicitly signaled in software.<p>- <a href="http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~yuan/papers/failure_analysis_osdi14.pdf">Simple Testing Can Prevent Most Critical Failures: An Analysis of Production Failures in Distributed Data-intensive Systems</a></p></blockquote><p>The number of times I have found bugs in my Python code due to silly mistakes like typos or not handling a particular error case makes me appreciate Rust's approach. Better to invest more time in development rather than finding bugs and errors once code has been shipped to production. </p><p>I still need to write more extensive unit tests and mock the external API calls but tests are a core language feature. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-03-test-organization.html">Developers are encourged</a> to write tests inside the source that is being tested, with integration tests in a "tests" directory.</p><h3 id="reason-2-portability">Reason 2: Portability</h3><p>Neither AWS Lambda nor Azure Functions have native support for Rust, but they both support Custom <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-custom.html">Runtimes</a>/<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-other">Handlers</a>. This allows you to build a generic web endpoint which, if it can handle to standard HTTP requests and return a standard HTTP response, can be executed by the platform.</p><p>(This is true for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-custom-handlers#http-only-function">an HTTP triggered function on Azure</a>. Getting into more platform-specific function types, like a Timer or Queue trigger, means relying more on the platform features. This makes it more difficult to port away, but not impossible).</p><p>All languages have a range of frameworks that help building web endpoints, often with an embedded web server. Rust has <a href="https://actix.rs/">Actix</a> and <a href="https://rocket.rs/">Rocket</a>, <a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2020-07-04-choosing-a-rust-web-framework-2020-edition/">amongst others</a>. By creating generic HTTP endpoints, the application can be run anywhere. AWS Lambda has <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime">some experimental Rust language bindings</a>, but creating a set of generic web endpoints is better because it is not then tied to a specific platform.</p><p>This is not unique to Rust. Python has <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask</a> (or <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, for a more "batteries included" approach). However, Rust differs because it is a statically compiled language. This means the output is a binary that runs entirely independently, only requiring the system libc implementation. If you <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/platform-and-target-support/musl-support-for-fully-static-binaries.html">compile it with a musl target</a> it becomes 100% static and will therefore run on any Linux OS. </p><p>Statically compiled binaries have all their dependencies included executable. This means the binary should continue to run "forever", even if the platform changes. Indeed, because the application is completely isolated and separate from the platform, there is no reliance on specific system-installed packages. Both can be updated independent of each other. This can be partly achieved using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html">Python Virtual Environments</a>, but they are complex and have developer overhead (<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0582/">PEP-0582</a> aims to fix that). Static compilation is a more robust approach.</p><p>It is currently convenient to run this bot on Azure, but it would be trivial to move it to AWS or a generic web server. Using <a href="https://upx.github.io/">upx</a> to <a href="https://github.com/svenstaro/upx-action">compress the executable</a> means the final binary with a full embedded web server is just 2.5MB. This application is so lightweight it could even run on a Raspberry Pi in the office - I'd just need to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html">compile it for ARM</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/compressed-binary.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/compressed-binary.png 600w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/compressed-binary.png 670w"><figcaption>The final 100% static, upx compressed binary. Only 2.5MB.</figcaption></figure><p>This is definitely overkill for a chatbot project. There is no tangible benefit to statically compiling a few hundred lines of Rust vs deploying the same length Python code to Azure Functions. There are only a couple of dependencies! </p><p>But this is a great test project to learn how it works (see Reason #1 above). Internal tools tend to be built quickly and with less polish than software you intend to ship to customers. Yet they often last the longest in production because of how widely used they become. In some organizations it can be hard to justify spending expensive developer time on such projects, so investing in maintainabilty upfront is worth it.</p><h3 id="reason-3-developer-tooling">Reason 3: Developer tooling</h3><p>The overall experience of writing Rust is made much more enjoyable because of the developer tooling. Everything revolves around <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html">Cargo</a> which makes documentation, dependency management, linting, testing, and builds all part of the core language. Installing Rust using the standard rustup command also includes Cargo and there are several useful extras like <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy">Clippy</a> and <a href="https://github.com/RustSec/cargo-audit">Audit</a>.</p><p>This is a big win for developers because everything you need is available out of the box. Third-party packages can be found in the <a href="https://crates.io/">Crate registry</a>. The equivalent in Python, <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPI</a> and <a href="https://packaging.python.org/key_projects/#pip">pip</a>, does not feel as slick and wasn't even included with Python when I first started coding it (when setuptools/easy_install were the primary method of package management). You also have to be careful to use a Python virtual environment if you have a system managed installation of Python, otherwise you will end up installing system-level dependencies.</p><p>I'm a vim user so the official <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust.vim">rust.vim plugin</a> gives me autocomplete and in-editor checks, but the output from Cargo (warnings and errors) is very helpful and pinpointing problems. <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy">rust-clippy</a> is fun, too.</p><p>Where Python has an advantage is the number of libraries. PyPI has over 280,000 packages whereas Cargo has 53,000. Quantity is not an indication of quality, and Python has been stable longer, but it is reasonable to expect vendors to provide official Python SDKs. That is less common with Rust.</p><h2 id="challenges-learning-rust">Challenges learning Rust</h2><p>I wrote the Python bot in a few hours but it took me several days to get the Rust port working. This would be hard to justify if it wasn't a learning project, but everyone gets faster with experience.

			<p>GameStop Corp (GME) continues to rally today and is now up over +370% in 2021. GME shorts and longs are in a knockout battle being waged in the stock market as well asocial media platforms. Both sides are holding their ground with strong conviction, but in the end, one side will be the outright winner, and in the later rounds of this prize fight the long shareholders are way ahead on points.</p>
<p>GME short interest is $5.51 billion; 71.79 million shares shorted; 139.57% SI % Float; 58.26% S3 SI % Float; 31% stock borrow fee on existing shorts and new shorts are paying over 80% fee.</p>
<p>GME has now climbed to #12 in the short interest league table:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.shortsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Capture-9.png" alt="" width="641" height="465" srcset="https://www.shortsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Capture-9.png 641w, https://www.shortsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Capture-9-585x424.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px"></p>
<p>A year ago, GME short interest was $276 million; 63.98 million shares shorted (stock price was $4.32); 104.01% SI % Float; 50.98% S3 SI % Float. While shares shorted only increased by +12%, total dollars as risk have risen by +1,900%. A scarcity in stock borrow availability has limited the increase in shares shorted, but even as mark-to market losses we are not seeing a decrease in overall shares shorted. In fact, GME has the highest level of SI % Float for any equity worldwide (with short interest over $100 million).</p>
<p>GME is #1 in highest Short Interest % of Float:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.shortsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Capture-10.png" alt="" width="640" height="254" srcset="https://www.shortsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Capture-10.png 640w, https://www.shortsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Capture-10-585x232.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></p>
<p>GME’s SI % of float is over 100%, which is illogical as you cannot get five quarts of milk out of a gallon jug. In actuality, GME’s short interest is 58.26% if we include the “synthetic longs” that are created by short sales in the float calculation. A portion of these “synthetic longs” become lendable shares as they settle in&nbsp; lending programs (mutual funds and ETF providers), marginable retail accounts and rehypothicatable hedge fund accounts. Short selling therefore not only provides added daily trading liquidity but also stock loan liquidity which supports not only the ability to execute Alpha generating short trades but also liquidity for portfolio hedging strategies and derivative (option\swap) hedging.</p>
<p>Over the last 30 days we saw shares shorted increase by +1.53 million shares, worth $117 million, an increase of +2.18% as its stock price rose +281%. Over the last 7 days we saw shares shorted increase by +900 thousand shares, worth $69 million, an increase of +1.27% as its stock price rose +116%.</p>
<p>We are still seeing a short squeeze on existing older shorts, with these more value-based short sellers trimming or closing their positions due to large mark-to-market losses. But, for every short position that is closed, and stock borrow returned we are seeing extremely strong demand from new short sellers looking to initiate new short positions and capitalize on an Icarus like fall for a stock price that has soared too high. Brokers and Prime Brokers are looking into every nook and cranny to satisfy short selling demand.</p>
<p>Shorting GME has not been a profitable trade for short sellers. Shorts were down -$968 million in net-of-financing mark-to-market losses in 2020 and are already down -$5.05 billion in 2021, which includes a loss of -$876 million on today’s +16% intraday move (stock price $89.00).</p>
<p>At the moment, the prize fight is between momentum longs and momentum shorts, with the longs way ahead on points but shorts are looking for a knock-out in the later rounds. While long buyers are continuing to throw punches by continuing to bid up stock prices, short sellers do not have many haymakers left to throw as stock borrow supply curtails new short selling activity in size.</p>

<p>If GME’s stock price remains at these levels or continues to rise, both value and momentum shorts will be squeezed out of their positions and GME’s stock price will get the added boost of short buy-to-covers standing shoulder to shoulder with long buyers in driving up GME’s stock price. But if GME’s stock price faulters, shorts will hold on to their positions and scramble for any slivers of stock loan borrows they can garner as long buyers begin exiting their positions in order to lock in their recent outsized mark-to-market profits. If long shareholders do begin selling, there may be an avalanche of long sellers hitting the tape since no-one wants to see their mark-to-market profits melt away and be the last ones holding the bag. Either way, this is a heavy weight fight worth watching.</p>

    <p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/hermetic_world.jpg" alt="The world description from an hermetic point of view was always convoluted and full of retrospective to enforce meaning" loading="lazy"></p>

<p><em>The year of the Linux desktop is coming</em>, and it looks like a piñata of
micro-services. Let’s break it and see the candies inside.</p>

<ul>
  <li>systemd core — the building block framework abstracting basic functionalities</li>
  <li>A universal package manager with a single reposotiry where anyone can push</li>
  <li>flatpak/appimage/snap — containarized applications</li>
  <li>polkit and apparmor — granular security</li>
  <li>systemd-homed — movable home with an immutable base system</li>
  <li>wayland compositors — the graphical environment</li>
  <li>pipewire — media pipeline</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re bored you can leave now, that’s it. Otherwise, let me get more
ideas out, but nothing surprising to anyone that has been following RedHat,
the freedesktop.org, and systemd.</p>

<p>The key innovation of the picture I lay above is that every
layer in the system is now isolated and communicate with one
another through d-bus services. D-bus is <a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2020/07/06/dbus-polkit.html">fantastic in its own
right</a> and good at
abstracting functionalities.</p>

<p>All of these pieces need one another. Wayland compositors need pipewire
to be able to access media hardware, and pipewire needs polkit (or
similar mechanism) to select who can do that. Similarly, containarized
applications access the rest of the system through systemd services,
polkit, and pipewire.</p>

<p>What this leads to is a base system that is stable, a solid framework
to build on. The home is transportable inside a systemd-homed, along
with the containarized apps, proprietary or not.</p>

<p>The deep secret insider info I got tells me that this is a giant scheme
to get us all in a vendor lock-in. I can lie, this is the internet.<br>
Or better (or worse?), this is a new Android ecosystem.</p>

<p>Who’s going to nag when this is all done in the open; when the open
source movers are the implementers of the de-facto implementations;
when they keep piling the standards until nobody can follow them.</p>

<p>I believe the direction the Linux desktop is going towards will
bring more incentives for investments. Distributions uniqueness
won’t matter anymore as they’ll be centralized around a “store”
where devs will push directly. (<a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2020/03/29/distro-pkgs.html">see previous post about distros
roles</a>)</p>

<p>Leave a comment if you weren’t aware of this vision of how distros will
look in the future.</p>

  2021-01-27
</p>
<p>This is an update of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/28.html">the popular 2018 FAQ</a>.  Details
have changed, but the spirit of the project is the same.  If you've already
read this, see <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2021/01/philosophy-design.html">yesterday's post</a> for more color.</p>
<p>Whenever I announce a new <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=oil-release#oil-release">Oil release</a>, some readers are confused
by the project.</p>
<p>This post explains the project's motivation from several perspectives.  Because
Unix shell is an old and successful technology, there are many ways of looking
at it.</p>
 
<a name="introduction"></a>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Before explaining <em>why</em> I created Oil, let's review <em>what</em> it is.  You can
think of a Unix shell in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>As a text-based <strong>user interface</strong>.  You communicate with the operating
system by typing commands.</li>
<li>As a <strong>language</strong>.  It has variables, functions, and loops.  Shell programs
are text files that start with <code>#!/bin/sh</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this document, we'll think of Unix shells as languages.  The Oil project
actually has <strong>two languages</strong>: OSH and Oil.  Let's define these terms, along with
two others for context:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=posix-shell-spec#posix-shell-spec">POSIX shell</a> is a language defined by a standards body.
For example, Debian Linux and FreeBSD are both Unix operating systems that
provide POSIX shells.  Nearly all shells are POSIX-compatible: <code>bash</code>,
<code>dash</code>, <code>ksh</code>, etc.</li>
<li>GNU <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> is the most popular shell implementation in the world.
It was first released in 1989, and implements the POSIX standard plus many
extensions.  It's the default shell on most Linux distributions, runs on BSD
Unix variants, <a href="https://scriptingosx.com/2019/06/moving-to-zsh/">used to ship on Mac OS X</a>, and <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265900/everything-you-can-do-with-windows-10s-new-bash-shell/">runs on
Windows</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH</a> is a shell implementation that's part of the Oil project.
It's compatible with both POSIX and <code>bash</code>.  The goal is to run <strong>existing
shell scripts</strong>.  It's done so <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/15.html">since January 2018</a>, and has matured
in <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/releases.html">many regular releases</a> since then.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=oil-language#oil-language">Oil language</a> is a brand new, incompatible, shell
language.  The idea is to fix more than four decades of accumulated warts in
the Unix shell.  Many Unix users are angry that shell is so difficult, and
Oil aims to fix that.  (Example: Why is <code>x=1</code> different than <code>x = 1</code>?)</li>
</ul>
<p>More about the Oil language:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compared to POSIX shell and bash, Oil is <strong>easier to learn, write, and
debug</strong>.  It's designed for programmers who know Python, JavaScript, or Ruby,
but avoid shell.</li>
<li>Oil will do everything bash can, <strong>and more</strong>.  For example, it will have
dynamic types and structured data, not just strings.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/01/simplest-explanation.html">The Simplest Explanation of Oil</a>
shows examples of the language.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/idioms.html">Oil Language Idioms</a> compares
old shell code and new Oil code.  Importantly, the same interpreter runs both
styles.  It's useful to think of OSH and Oil separately, but there's a
<strong>gradual transition</strong> between the two.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best description of the project is on <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/">the home page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oil is our upgrade path from <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> to a better language and runtime.</p>
</blockquote>
<a name="frequently-asked-questions"></a>
<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p>This section paraphrases questions I've received and summarizes the answers.
In most cases, I link to the original comment thread, which you can read for
details.</p>
<a name="how-is-oil-different-than-bash-or-zsh"></a>
<h3>How is Oil different than <code>bash</code> or <code>zsh</code>?</h3>
<p>Oil is taking shell seriously as a <strong>programming language</strong>, rather than
treating it as a text-based UI that can be abused to write programs.</p>
<p>To see why this is valuable, consider these two groups of shell users:</p>
<ol>
<li>People who use shell to type a few commands here and there.</li>
<li>People who write scripts, which may get into the hundreds or even thousands
of lines.</li>
</ol>
<p>Oil is aimed at group 2.  If you're in group 1, there's admittedly <strong>no
reason</strong> to use it right now.</p>
<p>However, group 2 writes scripts for group 1 to use!  So I believe the benefits
of Oil will eventually bubble up.</p>
<p>In other words, I'm building a <strong>solid foundation</strong> for a few more decades of
shell usage.</p>

</ul>
<a name="i-dont-understand-why-not-use-a-different-a-programming-language"></a>
<h3>I don't understand.  Why not use a different a programming language?</h3>
<p>It's important to be compatible with existing code.  You might not personally
use shell as a programming language, but all Unix users still rely on big shell
programs.  It's often used at build time, but it's still used at runtime too,
e.g. on embedded Linux devices.</p>
<p>Some of this code is old, but much of it is <strong>new</strong>.  It's not a small amount
of code, either.  Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, a popular cluster manager from Google (released around 2014),
has <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.3.0/test/wild.wwz/cloud/kubernetes/index.html">48,000+ lines</a> of shell in its repo.</li>
<li>Many distros use the <a href="https://github.com/scop/bash-completion">bash-completion</a> project for interactive completions,
and it has <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.3.0/test/wild.wwz/shell/bash-completion/index.html">26,000 lines</a> of shell.</li>
<li>More examples: <a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/The-Biggest-Shell-Programs-in-the-World">The Biggest Shell Programs in the
World</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/7lsajn/oil_shell_03_release/drom6q4/">Original question and answer</a> (reddit.com)</p>
<a name="shouldnt-we-discourage-people-from-writing-shell-scripts"></a>
<h3>Shouldn't we discourage people from writing shell scripts?</h3>
<p>There are three problems with that:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It won't work</strong>.  It would be like trying to convince people who are paid
to write PHP not to write PHP.  Many people have wasted breath on that, but
important sites like Wikipedia are still written in <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">hundreds of thousands
of lines of PHP</a>.</li>
<li>Even if a new line of shell never gets written, there will still be a <strong>huge
installed base</strong> of shell scripts that you may need to understand (e.g. when
they don't work).</li>
<li>Shell is <strong>still the best tool</strong> for many jobs.  Most new "cloud" projects
rely on Linux system images, in VMs or containers, and shell is the ideal
language for creating such images.   Even if you use a framework like Chef
or Docker, you're still using bits of shell.</li>
</ol>
<a name="shouldnt-scripts-over-100-lines-be-rewritten-in-python-or-ruby"></a>
<h3>Shouldn't scripts over 100 lines be rewritten in Python or Ruby?</h3>
<p>That's a reasonable choice in some circumstances.  If everyone on your dev team
knows Python, maintaining a shell script can be more costly than maintaining a
Python script.</p>
<p>However, Python and Ruby aren't good shell replacements in general.  Shell is a
domain-specific language for dealing with <strong>concurrent processes</strong> and the
<strong>file system</strong>.  But Python and Ruby have too much abstraction over these
concepts, sometimes in the name of portability (e.g. to Windows).  They hide
what's really going on.</p>
<p>I encountered a nice blog post, <a href="https://medium.com/capital-one-developers/bashing-the-bash-replacing-shell-scripts-with-python-d8d201bc0989">Replacing Shell Scripts with
Python</a>, which, in my opinion, inadvertently proves the
opposite point.  The Python version is longer and has more dependencies.  In
other words, it's more difficult to write and maintain.</p>
<p>Also see the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2021/01/philosophy-design.html#the-biggest-misconception-shell-xor-python">The Biggest Misconception: Shell XOR Python</a> in <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2021/01/philosophy-design.html">yesterday's
post</a>.</p>

<a name="are-you-reinventing-perl"></a>
<h3>Are you reinventing Perl?</h3>
<p>It's true that Perl is closer to shell than Python and Ruby are.  For example,
the <code>perl -pie</code> idiom can take the place of <code>awk</code> and <code>sed</code>.  However, Perl isn't
an acceptable shell either:</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn't have true pipelines (of processes).  I believe you have to "shell
out" for this.</li>
<li>It doesn't have a concept of file descriptor state.  How do you write the
equivalent of <code>my_shell_func 2&gt; err.txt</code>, where <code>my_shell_func</code> can invoke
both functions and external commands?</li>
<li>Perl has a function called <code>grep()</code>, but the real <code>grep</code> is better for many
problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perl has been around for more than 30 years, and hasn't replaced shell.  It
hasn't replaced <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> either.</li>
<li>Perl 6 and Python 3 are both less-suited to shell-like problems than their
predecessors.  In other words, we still need a new shell.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it's true that, in some respects, Oil is retreading the same ground as
Perl.  But Oil is more faithful to shell, and its syntax uses fewer punctuation
characters.  In other words, it's less like "line noise".</p>
<p>Threads:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/7lsajn/oil_shell_03_release/drp7jv6/">Perl vs Shell</a> (reddit)</li>
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16228941">Are you reinventing Perl?</a> (Hacker News)</li>
</ul>
<a name="im-still-angry-and-i-dont-want-you-to-create-a-new-shell"></a>
<h3>I'm still angry, and I don't want you to create a new shell.</h3>
<p>You might be angry because you had to maintain a nasty shell script written by
a coworker.</p>
<p>If that's the case, you should be helping Oil succeed!  The only way to "kill
bash" is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reimplement it, then</li>
<li>Gradually migrate away from it.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is analogous to how Facebook is moving away from PHP by developing a
similar, but cleaner, language called <a href="http://hacklang.org/">Hack</a>.</p>
<p>Perl, Python, and Ruby have all existed for over 25 years, but they haven't
replaced shell.  New shell scripts are being written every day.</p>

<p>(Oil also has some similarity to <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>, which smoothed over some of
JavaScript's rough edges and added syntactic sugar, but didn't stray from its
core execution model.  CoffeeScript was a success because it influenced
subsequent versions of JavaScript.)</p>
<a name="should-i-limit-myself-to-posix-shell-scripts"></a>
<h3 id="limit-to-posix">Should I limit myself to POSIX shell scripts?</h3>
<p>I've seen this suggestion a lot, and there are entire books devoted to it.  If
your script is <strong>small</strong>, it may be a reasonable goal.</p>
<p>For bigger programs, limiting yourself to POSIX is not just inconvenient, it's
also an ill-defined and virtually untestable concept.  Evidence:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Debian project created a minimal shell variant called <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash">dash</a>, which
replaced <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>.  However, <code>dash</code> and the <a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/#scripts">Debian Policy on Shell
Scripts</a> both allow non-POSIX features, like <code>local</code>.  Local
variables are essential for writing maintainable shell scripts, but POSIX
doesn't mention them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most shells <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-bash/2018-01/msg00000.html">parse assignment builtins differently than other
builtins</a>, but the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=posix-grammar#posix-grammar">POSIX shell grammar</a>
has no notion of an assignment.  This issue surfaced as early as 2010, but as
of 2018, it's not in a published spec.</p>
<p>This issue <strong>isn't theoretical</strong> — <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash">dash</a> differ in
practice, but POSIX doesn't specify which is correct.</p>
<p>In other words, POSIX is incomplete and out of date.  (However, I've
discovered that shells are highly conformant with respect to things the
standard <strong>does</strong> specify.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As of 2021, I believe that OSH is a "better POSIX".  POSIX is a <strong>descriptive</strong>
specification and not a <strong>normative</strong> one. That means that it's an observation
of how popular shells like <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=ksh#ksh">ksh</a> and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> happened to behave at a certain
time.  In other words, it's a compromise.</p>
<p>Similarly, OSH is based on <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/06/22.html">extensive testing</a> of the behavior of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>,
<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash">dash</a>, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=mksh#mksh">mksh</a>, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=zsh#zsh">zsh</a>, and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=busybox#busybox">busybox</a> <code>ash</code>.  That is, it uses the
same philosophy as POSIX, but it specifies more of the language.  Roughly
speaking, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=spec-test#spec-test">spec tests</a> are an <strong>executable specification</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-bash/2018-01/msg00002.html">Tilde Expansion</a>: Another case where shells diverge in practice, but
POSIX is silent.</li>
</ul>

<a name="how-can-you-design-a-good-language-on-top-of-shell"></a>
<h3>How can you design a good language on top of shell?</h3>
<p>POSIX shell has global options that affect parsing and execution like <code>set -o noglob</code>.  And <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> extends them with options like <code>shopt -s lastpipe</code>.</p>
<p>Oil continues in the same vein, adding several shell options under <code>s…</code></p></div>

            The Culture War: Iain M. Banks’s Billionaire Fans    </h3>                    
<h4><strong>Why Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos love Iain M. Banks’ anarcho-communist space opera</strong>.</h4>



<p><strong>by Kurt Schiller</strong></p>



<p>Explicitly ideological fiction is as old as fiction itself. From ancient steles that boasted unconvincingly of the glorious defeat of the Sea Peoples to the biased histories of that ancient greek fabulist Herodotus, humans have always had a tendency to entangle ideology and entertainment.</p>



<p>And if anything, the last hundred years have only seen this tendency grow. Fiction—whether the written word or newer mediums—has remained a popular standard-bearer for ideologies as diverse as technocratic liberalism (<em>The West Wing</em>), free market right-libertarianism (<em>Atlas Shrugged</em>, <em>The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress</em>), socialism (<em>The Jungle</em>, <em>The Iron Heel</em>), and even violent white supremacy (<em>The Turner Diaries</em>, <em>The Camp of the Saints</em>). And in the 21st century, the ideological implications of media consumption have become as micro-targeted as the media themselves: if you are a “true American patriot”, you might consume such jingoistic potboilers as <em>13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi </em>or the suburbs-vs-antifa thriller <em>The Reliant</em>. If you are a god-fearing evangelical, perhaps <em>Assassin 33 A.D.</em> or the Kevin Sorbo-fronted <em>God’s Not Dead </em>series are more your speed. Seeking to seize the means? Perhaps you can first seize a controller and dig into <em>Tonight We Riot</em> or Disco Elysium.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="460" height="276" src="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iain-banks.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iain-banks.jpg 460w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iain-banks-300x180.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px"></figure></div>



<p>Meanwhile, the reverse has also become true: “If a particular piece of media reeks of ideological impurity,” the conventional wisdom seems to go, “why bother? Why would you let those toxic ideas into your head?”</p>



<p>For all that these notions of ideological contagion and symbology are hilariously overblown, there’s some truth to the matter. At times, reading or watching long-form fiction from someone to whom you are ideologically opposed can feel exhausting, draining, aggravating, and ultimately a bit futile—like being at a party where you simply don’t like anyone, don’t care about the discussions, and are annoyed at the food. There’s much to be gained by engaging with our rhetorical opponents… but, frankly, only up to a point.</p>



<p>What then are we to take from the distinct and quite public fascination of the two richest men in the world—Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, together worth more than $375 billion—with the sci-fi works of Iain M. Banks, an avowedly socialist author who set his far-future fiction in what might best be described as a post-scarcity, anarcho-communist utopia; a world where your Bezoses and your Musks are not just irrelevant, but actively sought out and disempowered by a society comprised of property-less workers and all-caring, mostly-benevolent A.I.s?</p>



<p>*  *  *  *  *</p>



<p>Iain M. Banks’s <em>Culture </em>series—consisting of 10 largely standalone novels and a handful of short stories published between 1987 and the author’s death in 2013—charts the intrigues, impacts, and subterfuges of a group of space-faring, far-future transhumans called The Culture.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In some ways, it’s an almost archetypal space opera. Tough-as-nails soldiers and shady sci-fi diplomats wage war across a variety of fantastical planets and megastructures. Massive, high-tech ships piloted by ultra-powerful self-aware A.I. called Minds have super-science duels among the stars. There are assassinations, revolutions, mass battles with hundreds of ships that play out on a grand scale (while taking only a fraction of a second in objective time).</p>



<p>At first glance, it seems like exactly what you’re imagining when you hear the phrase “space opera,” and so of course two super-wealthy spaceflight-and-sci-fi aficionados would be fans, right? After all, both men own private spaceflight contractors (Musk’s SpaceX and Bezos’s Blue Origin) and speak often of mankind’s future among the stars, with Musk <a href="https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/"><strong>proposing a mission to Mars</strong></a> and Bezos <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/11/18564655/blue-origin-jeff-bezos-space-moon-new-glenn"><strong>pitching a return to the moon and other intrasystem exploration</strong></a>. Seeking the stars seems to be in their blood (assuming it hasn’t been completely replaced with <a href="https://bloodknife.com/buy-happiness-here/"><strong>Soylent and whatever nootropics billionaires get</strong></a>).</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-12.01.23-AM.png" alt="" width="438" height="576" srcset="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-12.01.23-AM.png 536w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-12.01.23-AM-228x300.png 228w" sizes="(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px"></figure></div>



<p>Both men have found ways to conspicuously show their fandom: Musk by <a href="https://www.tor.com/2015/01/23/elon-musk-iain-m-banks-just-read-the-instructions/"><strong>naming SpaceX rockets after Banks’s tongue-in-cheek Culture ships</strong></a> (“Just Read The Instructions,” “Of Course I Still Love You”) and a “brain interface” loosely patterned after the Culture’s neural laces; Bezos by attempting to bankroll a big-budget TV series based on the books, although this latter effort was unceremoniously canceled after Banks’s estate abruptly backed out. (Probably a wise decision, given both the challenge of adapting the material and the absurdity of one of the most exploitative corporations in the world attempting to adapt proudly far-left sci-fi.)</p>



<p>Apart from official projects, both men have made public references to Banks’s work as well—not much, but enough to know that they either really have read it, or that they were well-briefed by their PR teams.</p>



<p>“The Culture series is certainly, in terms of more modern science fiction, one of my absolute favorites,” Jeff Bezos <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2018/jeff-bezos-isdc-space-vision/"><strong>told GeekWire in 2018</strong></a>, when asked about his love for the series. ”We’re not quite at that level technologically, we’ve a lot of work to do before we get there, but there’s a utopian element to it that I find very attractive.”</p>



<p>*  *  *  *  *</p>



<p>There are ultimately two things that set the <em>Culture </em>series apart from many of its peers.</p>



<p>The first is the literary bent of the prose. Space opera (and genre fiction in general) has never <em>actually</em> looked like the “lasers and explosions” stereotype it was saddled with, but it’s worth emphasizing the depth of Banks’s characterization and strange depictions of an uncanny future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Characters grapple with trauma, identity, and crisis, and they do so without losing sight of the visceral and pulpy thrill of space opera’s inherent adventure and intrigue. Moments of quiet contemplation and deep metaphysical quandaries abound, coupled with strange literary pretensions that wouldn’t seem out of place in magical realism or literary fiction—a vast machine the size of a planet made of interlocking, nested globes, each holding a separate society; a grief-sick partner who holds their pregnancy in stasis for the better part of a century in a strange act of penance and passive-aggression; a vast extra-dimensional object that resists all attempts to analyze, communicate, or attack it, nearly sparking an interstellar war. The stories of the Culture simultaneously have a very real sense of strangeness and a deep, complex humanist bent, as if picking the best bit from multiple genres without losing the sense and feel of each constituent part.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p><span><strong>Since he first came onto the literary scene in the mid-Eighties, Banks was an avowed and rather public socialist.&nbsp;</strong></span></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Perhaps this savvy genre-bending should come as no surprise, considering Banks was an established author of literary fiction before he broke through as a sci-fi writer. While he had always dreamed of writing sci-fi (and indeed wrote at least one Culture novel before breaking through as a lit-fic author), it wasn’t until his break-out literary novel <em>The Wasp Factory</em> (1984) that he was able to start selling his sci-fi manuscripts, eventually settling into a rhythm where he danced more-or-less annually between mind-bending literary fiction published under the name Iain Banks and epic sci-fi novels published under the name “Iain <em>M.</em> Banks.” (His family, Banks explained, was offended he hadn’t used his middle name—Menzies—on <em>The Wasp Factory</em>.)</p>



<p>The other thing that sets both Banks and his <em>Culture </em>books apart is their overt and uncompromising politics.</p>



<p>Since he first came onto the literary scene in the mid-Eighties, Banks was an avowed and rather public socialist. He was a member of the Scottish Socialist Party and a frequent interviewee for magazines like <em>Socialist Worker</em>, as well as an outspoken opponent of the Iraq War who campaigned for the impeachment of Tony Blair and, when that failed, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/may/25/hayfestival2007.hayfestival"><strong>shredded his passport and mailed the remains to 10 Downing Street</strong>.</a> He spoke openly, and passionately, about labor exploitation, anti-imperialism, the environment, and a host of other now-popular issues, most of which still languished on the edge of the discourse when Banks first hit the scene.</p>



<p>He was also never shy about intermingling his politics and his work. Indeed, he saw them as being one and the same. Nowhere is this more clear than in a <a href="http://www.vavatch.co.uk/books/banks/cultnote.htm"><strong>1994 essay titled “A Few Notes on the Culture,”</strong></a> which Banks posted to the Usenet group rec.arts.sf.written. The sprawling document is both an overview of the Culture and an exegesis on Banks’s own worldview; between paragraphs delving into the society’s naming conventions, technology, and democratic apparatuses, Banks waxed poetic about the deleterious moral impact of capitalism and market forces:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>“The market, for all its (profoundly inelegant) complexities, remains a crude and essentially blind system, and is – without the sort of drastic amendments liable to cripple the economic efficacy which is its greatest claimed asset – intrinsically incapable of distinguishing between simple non-use of matter resulting from processal superfluity and the acute, prolonged and wide-spread suffering of conscious beings.</em></p><p><em>It is, arguably, in the elevation of this profoundly mechanistic (and in that sense perversely innocent) system to a position above all other moral, philosophical and political values and considerations that humankind displays most convincingly both its present intellectual [immaturity and] – through grossly pursued selfishness rather than the applied hatred of others – a kind of synthetic evil.”</em></p><cite>Iain M. Banks, “A Few Notes on the Culture”</cite></blockquote>



<p>These same politics have been front and center in Banks’s conception of the Culture, a group he affectionately described as “hippie commies with hyper-weapons and a deep distrust of both Marketolatry and Greedism.”</p></div></div>

<p>I like poker, but I’m better at chess.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png" alt="Poker vs chess" width="499" height="451" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-347x314.png 347w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-694x628.png 694w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-768x695.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-1536x1389.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px"></a></p>
<p>Poker can be a lot of fun if you have a witty enough group of friends and a generous snack budget. There’s nothing worse than playing poker with a bunch of serious gamblers who think conversation and choice of hot wing spiciness are potential tells.</p>
<p>I like chess because nothing is hidden. I don’t like leaving things to chance, and I’m often foolish enough to believe I can figure out how to win if I have all the information.</p>
<p>In chess, there are no missing pieces. There isn’t a sneaky queen that your opponent can place on the board when you least expect it. Everything is in the open. The strategy and tactics are entirely determined by what is sitting in front of you in plain sight.</p>
<p>If I try to play poker the way I play chess, I’m going to lose. I can’t see all the cards. Information is hidden from me, and it’s information I need to make the right decisions.</p>
<p>If you can’t stand the uncertainty of poker, don’t do a startup. Don’t do an innovation project.</p>
<p>Innovation is like poker.</p>

<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11.png" alt="A group of people playing poker" width="599" height="441" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-427x314.png 427w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-853x628.png 853w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-768x565.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-1536x1130.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>

<h2>The Rules of Startup Poker</h2>
<p>This is not an ordinary game of poker. (So don’t worry if you’re not a poker player, this will still make sense.) I will stretch the analogy of Texas Hold ‘Em as far as I can in this special variation of Startup Poker.</p>
<p>Each player needs to pay the ante to play. This is a cheap game, so we’ll keep the ante at $1. Those are the costs of running an innovation project.</p>
<p>Each player gets dealt two cards that they can keep hidden. These cards represent the organization’s unique capabilities and business model — what they already have when they start.</p>

<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png" alt="A group of people playing poker part 2" width="599" height="450" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-418x314.png 418w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-836x628.png 836w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-768x577.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-1536x1154.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>As a normal Texas Hold ‘Em game progresses, the dealer will turn over additional cards in the middle of the table, which each player can use as part of their hand. First there are the three cards called “the Flop,” which are turned over at the same time. Then a fourth card is turned, which is called “Fourth Street” or “The Turn.” The last card is “the River.” Players can place bets before each of these rounds, trying to raise the stakes and force other players to fold.</p>

<p>In Startup Poker, all these shared cards represent the Market. The first three cards are “the Early Adopters.” The fourth card is “the Early Majority” and the last is “the Late Majority.” As the game goes on, the Market matures and players discover if they hold the winning hand.</p>
<p>The winner of the game is the person who has the best fit between the cards in their hand (which represents their business model) and the cards on the table (the Market). We can think of this as Product / Market fit or Business Model / Market fit.</p>

<p>The basic setup is the same, but remember, we are not playing regular Texas Hold ‘Em. Our rules are a bit different.</p>
<h2>Information Costs Money</h2>
<p>In Startup Poker, players have to ante another $1 every round to stay in. This is the cost of product development. (For our purposes, we are eliminating the standard Hold’em practice of “blinds,” which is a form of uneven antes.).</p>
<p>Additionally, instead of every round beginning by flipping over Market cards, players can get a preview by paying an additional $1 for each card. (In real poker, everyone sees the flipped card, but in our version you’re paying for a sneak peek.)</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png" alt="A poker player peeking at a flipped card" width="699" height="514" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-427x314.png 427w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-853x628.png 853w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-768x565.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-1536x1130.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px"></a></p>
<p>This is the equivalent of funding an <a href="https://kromatic.com/workshops/building-and-resourcing-teams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="innovation team" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked">innovation team</a> to gather Market information. This investment isn’t really just money, it’s blood, sweat, and tears. But since people * time = money, we’ll just use our poker chips to represent this investment. The team is really going out into the real world, talking to customers, putting up a landing page, or running some other form of experiment or research to gather information.</p>
<p>At that point, they have the option to kill the idea (fold) or persevere before a round of betting.</p>
<p>Should we go straight ahead and bet on our hand? Or should we buy a peek at the Market first?</p>
<h2>Bet It All in Waterfall</h2>
<p>We could just close our eyes and bet it all on our pair of jacks. This is the equivalent of <a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/lean-startup-in-the-enterprise-anti-pattern-the-lean-waterfall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">waterfall development</a>, where we place our bets and literally let the cards fall where they may.</p>
<p>We believe our cards are the correct ones for the Market, despite having not seen a single card from that Market. So we are placing a lot of faith in our business model and capabilities — our pair of jacks — and to be fair, that is a formidable hand.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png" alt="A player risking it all to bet in a poker game" width="599" height="405" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-465x314.png 465w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-929x628.png 929w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-768x519.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-1536x1038.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>But we’ve invested for the long hall, so we push it all in and check the snack bar while the hand plays out. But the Market isn’t kind. Our opponent starts with a 2 and a 4, but winds up closing a 2-6 straight with the 3, 5 and 6 from the Market. We lose to a weaker starting hand that ended up being better for that Market. We end up sitting in the corner binging on Pringles and lukewarm beer for the rest of the night while everyone else keeps playing, but that’s a risk of Waterfall.</p>
<h2>Information Has Value</h2>
<p>So instead of going all-in based on our business model and capabilities, should we buy that peek at the Market if we’re holding a pair of jacks?</p>
<p>The answer here is yes. Obviously so.</p>
<p>If everyone is sneaking a peek at the next card except you, you are at a huge disadvantage. Now they are playing chess because they can see more of the board. Meanwhile, you think you are still playing poker.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png" alt="A player playing chess blindfolded" width="512" height="565" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png 1812w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-285x314.png 285w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-569x628.png 569w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-768x847.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-1392x1536.png 1392w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></a></p>
<p>True, they still can’t see their opponents’ hole cards, so they don’t have all the information, but they have more than you.</p>
<p>So should you pay for the peek no matter what you are holding in your hand? Well, that depends on the cost.</p>
<h2>Don’t Play Every Hand</h2>
<p>If you start the game with a 2 of spades and a 9 of hearts, you have a bad hand. It’s not worth getting Market information because you are woefully unprepared for any Market. You might get lucky and find three twos on the board, but that’s a longshot. The odds are that someone else has a better hand. Just fold and play the next hand.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5.png" alt="2 Of spades and 9 of hearts" width="399" height="354" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-354x314.png 354w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-708x628.png 708w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-768x682.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-1536x1363.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px"></a></p>
<p>For large organizations, this is the equivalent of having an idea that is fundamentally mismatched with the company.</p>
<p>“Let’s make vegan hamburgers,” says the mining company.</p>
<p>This makes no sense. It is the 2/9 offsuit of business ideas. Let’s skip this idea and work on something with a little more promise.</p>
<h2>Pivoting</h2>
<p>In the real world, startups aren’t stuck with the cards that they are dealt. If something isn’t working with their business model, they can pivot.</p>
<p>You can also alter your product in Startup Poker, because after you peek at the cards on the board, we let you trade the cards in your hand — for a price. Each round, each player has the opportunity to trade in one card at a cost of $1. It’s an option to change your product / business model after you’ve gotten a taste of the market.</p>
<p>So let’s say you start with a pair of twos — one heart and one spade. You pay $3 to peek at three cards. They are the three, four, and five of hearts.</p>
<p>You might want to trade in your two of spades and get a new card from the deck, giving yourself a shot at a flush, a straight, or a straight flush.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png" alt="Early adopters vs business model" width="599" height="585" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-321x314.png 321w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-643x628.png 643w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-768x750.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-1536x1501.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>You are exercising an option to find a better fit with the Market. It’s only the information that you’ve gained by buying a peek at the Market that makes this pivot worthwhile.</p>
<h2>Arrogance</h2>
<p>Let’s face it, arrogance never helps in chess or in poker. Everytime I get cocky in chess, I lose.</p>
<p>Chess rankings are highly visible when playing. So when I relax for my lunchtime game and see that I’m playing someone with a rating 200 points below me, I know I’m going to win. Which is of course exactly when I’m going to lose.</p>
<p>I’m so confident in winning that I start checking my Slack messages while playing. Then I draft an email. Then I make some tea. I get distracted, forget my plan, and generally make a stupid mistake.</p>
<p>“Bad luck!” But there is no luck in chess — this is the folly of arrogance.</p>
<p>If we really wanted to make Startup Poker realistic, every player would be forced to drink 5 shots of bourbon before playing, then when they look at the two cards in their hand they’ll be convinced they have three of a kind. Every entrepreneur thinks they are the second coming of Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>Confidence is great. Good entrepreneurs don’t go into a market without some level of confidence. But arrogance allows your confidence to overrule your judgement.</p>
<h2>The Size of the Pot</h2>
<p>There’s another oddity to Startup Poker in that no one knows exactly how big the pot is. It is somewhat determined by the antes that people are paying in and the bets being made, but mostly it’s determined by the Market.</p>
<p>Of course, people can bet up the pot and force players to invest more to keep up. It’s the same as startups competing against each other. When one buys advertising, the others better match it or have a better strategy.</p>
<p>To calculate the value of the Market, we add up the value of the cards to determine the size of the pot (numbered cards are worth their face value, royal cards are worth $10, and aces are worth $15). So this makes buying Market information even more important.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png" alt="The size of the pot" width="699" height="356" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-600x306.png 600w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-1200x612.png 1200w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-768x391.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-1536x783.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px"></a></p>
<p>Don’t waste your money and time playing for a small pot.</p>
<h2>Crowded Markets</h2>
<p>Lastly, look at who is competing. It can be very compelling to play in a game with fewer people. Remember, the size of the prize is mostly determined by the Market, not the amount of competition. Unfortunately, in Startup Poker, players can join the game at any time.</p>
<p>When the dealer starts turning over Market cards, players who have not anteed up to that point can opt in. Of course at first they are at a disadvantage. They have missed at least one opportunity to get advanced information, and they’ve lost at least one opportunity to pivot. But they can still get into the Market — a Market that you’ve already invested in.</p>
<p>So if the first two cards the Market shows are a King and Jack, that’s $20 already in the pot. That might attract some latecomers to the game, and the competition might increase quickly.</p>

<p>Players who find themselves alone in a game at the early stages should still take advantage of the opportunity to get more information early, and to pivot if necessary. Even if …</p></div></div>

<p>A realistic look at Python web frameworks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you take a look around the blogosphere at various benchmarks for Python web frameworks, you might start to feel pretty bad about your own setup. Or, alternatively, super-hyped about the possibilities.</p><p>Consider, for instance, the incredible work of the guys at <a href="https://magic.io/blog/uvloop-blazing-fast-python-networking/">magic stack</a>, getting <strong>100,000 requests per second</strong> from <a href="https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop">uvloop</a> in a single thread. This is on par with compiled language like Go's performance.</p><p>But that benchmark doesn't really cover a fully fleshed out web framework, right? We need a lot more functionality and structure from our frameworks than reading and writing bytes. What about fully fleshed-out web-frameworks in python?</p><p>One such framework is <a href="https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic">Sanic</a>, which again has been shown to have similar performance: <strong>100,000</strong> requests per-second. Or there's <a href="https://vibora.io/">Vibora</a>. Not only does this claim to be a drop-in replacement for <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a>, but it also has its own templating engine. And it handles <strong>350,000 requests per second</strong>!</p><p>Even more mind-blowing is <a href="https://github.com/squeaky-pl/japronto">Japronto</a> which claims an insane <strong>1.2 million requests per-second</strong> in a single thread 🤯 trouncing the performance of other languages and frameworks:</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/squeaky-pl/japronto/master/benchmarks/results.png" alt="https://github.com/squeaky-pl/japronto"></p><p>Recently we've been doing a lot of work improving the performance of our Python APIs. Currently we're running <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a>, and we initially had a single question: <em>how can we serve more requests from a single worker thread? </em>But looking at these benchmarks had us asking more:</p><ol><li>Can we meaningfully compare them to our setup?</li><li>How realistic are they for a full production application?</li><li>Would we be better using one of these frameworks over Flask?</li></ol><p>In other words, how much should we trust these benchmarks? And to what extent should they influence our choice of technology?</p><p>In order to answer these questions, in this post, I benchmark a realistic Flask application along with it's <a href="https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic">Sanic</a> equivalent. I'm going to guess that most readers come from a background with one of the more "traditional" Python frameworks (<a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a> or <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>), and it's certainly more relevant to devs here at Suade Labs. For this reason, I run the Flask app in a number of different ways, to see what the best bang for our buck is: how performant can we make our application with (almost) zero changes to the code? Along the way we'll pick up some tips for the original question: <em>how can we serve more requests from a single worker thread?</em></p><p><strong>Sidenote: </strong>if you're new to Python's web frameworks, or its asynchronous libraries, take a look at [1] from the addenda at the bottom of this post for a quick explainer. This post mostly assumes you know these things.</p><h2 id="the-baseline">The baseline</h2><p>First let's run some simple "Hello, World!" benchmarks on our system to get a meaningful baseline for comparison. For reference, the Flask benchmarks on <a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r18&amp;hw=ph&amp;test=fortune&amp;l=zijzen-f">techempower</a> give 25,000 requests per second.</p><p>Here's our Flask app:</p><pre><code>app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def hello():
    if request.method == "GET":
        return "Hello, World!"

    data = request.get_json(force=True)
    try:
        return "Hello, {id}".format(**data)
    except KeyError:
        return "Missing required parameter 'id'", 400</code></pre><p>I ran it under a variety of conditions. First "raw" via <code>python app.py</code>, and then under <a href="https://gunicorn.org/">Gunicorn</a> with a single <code>sync</code> worker via <code>gunicorn -k sync app:app</code> and finally Gunicorn with a single <a href="https://github.com/gevent/gevent">gevent</a> worker via <code>gunicorn -k gevent app:app</code>. In theory Gunicorn should handle concurrency and dropped connections much better than the raw python, and using the gevent worker should allow us to do asynchronous IO without changing our code [2a]. We also ran these benchmarks under <a href="https://www.pypy.org/">PyPy</a>, which in theory should speed up any CPU-bound code without making any changes (if you haven't heard of PyPy see [2b] in the addenda below for a quick explanation and some terminology).</p><p>And what about Sanic? Well, here's the "rewrite" of our app:</p><pre><code>app = Sanic(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
async def hello(request):
    if request.method == "GET":
        return text("Hello, World!")

    data = request.json
    try:
        return text("Hello, {id}".format(**data))
    except KeyError:
        raise InvalidUsage("Missing required parameter 'id'")</code></pre><p>And here are the results:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/hello_world-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 1000w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 1161w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><div><p>Some technical details: I used Python 3.7 with the regular CPython interpreter and Python 3.6 with PyPy 7.3.3. At the time of writing, running 3.6 is the latest PyPy interpreter, and their Python 2.7 interpreter is faster in some edge cases, but as Python 2 is <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/">officially dead</a>, I don't believe it productive to benchmark. My system details are available in the addenda [3]. I used <a href="https://github.com/wg/wrk">wrk</a> to actually execute the benchmarks.</p><p>I'll break the results down in two parts. First: Sanic dominates, with 23,000 requests a second, although running our Flask app under Guncorn + gevent and PyPy does a pretty good job at keeping up. Second: what's going on with the performance range for our Flask app?</p></div><p>Under CPython, we see that using Gunicorn quadruples the number of Flask requests per second from 1,000 to 4,000 and using a gevent worker adds a mild (sub 10%) speed boost to this. The PyPy results are more impressive. In the raw test, it is churning through 3,000 requests a second; it received the same 4x speed boost from Gunicorn, getting us to 12,000 requests a second; finally with the addition of gevent, it cranks up to 17,000 requests a second, 17x more than the raw CPython version without changing a single line of code.</p><p>I was quite struck by the fact that gevent had such little effect on the CPython process - probably this is because the CPU is maxed out at this point. On the other hand, it seems that PyPy's better speed means it is still spending time waiting on system calls / IO, even under Gunicorn. Adding gevent to the mix means that it switches between concurrent connections, processing them as fast as the CPU will let it.</p><p>To get a real sense of this, I ran the benchmark whilst monitoring CPU usage. Here's a short test against the raw app under PyPy:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png 919w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>You can see that the program hops between CPU cores and rarely utilises 100% of a given core. On the other hand, here's part of a much longer test against the Gunicorn gevent worker under PyPy:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png 900w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Now it's evident that there is no switching between CPU cores (the process has become "sticky") and the individual core is being utilised to a far higher degree.</p><p><strong>Key takeaways</strong>: Sanic wins. PyPy is fast. Run your "traditional" app under Gunicorn.</p><h2 id="realistic-benchmarks">Realistic benchmarks</h2><div><p>The benchmark above, while fun, is pretty meaningless for real-world applications. Let's add some more functionality to our app!</p><p>First, we'll allow users to actually store data in a database, which we'll retrieve via an ORM (in our case <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a>, the de-facto stand-alone ORM in python). Second, we'll add input-validation to make sure our users get meaningful error messages, and that we're not accepting junk that crashes our app. Finally we'll add a response marshaller to automate the process of converting our database object to JSON.</p></div><p>We'll write a simple book store app, for a publishing house. We have a number of authors each writing zero or more books in several genres. For simplicity, each book has only a single author, but can have multiple genres - for example we could have a book which is in both the "Existential Fiction" and "Beatnik Poetry" categories. We're going to add 1 million authors to our database and roughly 10 million books. [4]</p><p>Our SQLAlchemy models look a little like this:</p>
<pre><code>class Author(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(UUIDType, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)
    ... # snip!

class Book(db.Model):
    author_id = db.Column(
        UUIDType, db.ForeignKey("author.id"), nullable=False, index=True
    )
    author = db.relationship("Author", backref="books")
    ... # snip!
</code></pre>
<p>To marshal these, we use <a href="https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Marshmallow</a>, which is a popular Python marshalling library. Here's an example of the Marshmallow model for the Author overview:</p>
<pre><code>class Author(Schema):
    id = fields.Str(dump_only=True)
    name = fields.Str(required=True)
    country_code = EnumField(CountryCodes, required=True)
    email = fields.Str(required=True)
    phone = fields.Str(required=True)
    contact_address = fields.Str(required=True)
    contract_started = fields.DateTime(format="iso")
    contract_finished = fields.DateTime(format="iso")
    contract_value = fields.Integer()
</code></pre>
<p>In our endpoints these are used for validating input and returning results like so:</p>
<pre><code>@bp.route("/author", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def author():
    """View all authors, or create a new one."""

    if request.method == "GET":
        args = validate_get(marshallers.LimitOffsetSchema())
        limit = args["limit"]
        offset = args["offset"]

        authors = Author.query.limit(limit).offset(offset).all()
        return jsonify(marshallers.authors.dump(authors))

    if request.method == "POST":
        author = Author(**validate_post(marshallers.author))

        db.session.add(author)
        db.session.commit()

        return jsonify({"id": author.id})
</code></pre>
<p>The full source code can be viewed in the <a href="https://github.com/olliemath/async_python">GitHub repo</a>. Here, the thing to note is that <code>marshallers.foo</code> is an instance of a <a href="https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Marshmallow</a> schema, which can be used both to validate a Foo input, for instance in a POST request, as well as to marshal Foo instances ready for returning as JSON.</p>
<p>In order to actually perform asynchronous database requests, some fancy footwork is required with patching libraries, which depends on which postgres connector you use. SQLAlchemy does not support this out of the box, and in fact its primary developer has a great post arguing that <a href="https://techspot.zzzeek.org/2015/02/15/asynchronous-python-and-databases/">an async ORM is not always a great idea</a>. Juicy technical details in addenda [5], but beware that just using a Gunicorn gevent worker will not necessarily get you what you want.</p><p>PyPy tends to suffer a performance hit when using C-extensions and libraries instead of pure python, conversely CPython should get a performance boost from the C-based libs. To take account of this I tested two different underlying database connectors: both <a href="https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2">psycopg2</a> and a …</p></div></section></article></div></div>

<!-- TODO: middle1 -->

  

    
    <div>
        <p>LONDON. <strong>Mr Pascal Soriot, CEO of AstraZeneca, why hasn't AstraZeneca been more specific on detailing the supply problem detected on its European plants? What exactly is the problem? &nbsp;</strong></p>

<div><p>“I think we have been relatively specific with the information. Of course, we are all very disappointed. We would like to produce more. I think we will deliver up to Europe in the month of February a reasonable quantity actually, very similar to what others have delivered on a monthly basis. But of course, it's less than expected and also because our vaccine is easy to use people expected more so we could scale up.&nbsp;Our team is working 24/7 to fix the very much issues of production of the vaccine itself. You have two steps in the production of a vaccine: one is you produce the vaccine itself. We call it a drug substance, the vaccine. Then, when we are finished with it, we move this into different plants where we put the vaccine into vials and we call that the drug product, the final product.&nbsp;For Europe the drugs substance is essentially produced in two plants, one in the Netherlands, one in Belgium. The drug product is actually produced in Italy and Germany. So from a drug product viewpoint, we have full capacity. We have zero problem. The current problems have to do with manufacturing the drugs substance”. &nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
“So maybe I need to give you a little bit of explanation as to how we manufacture those vaccines. Essentially, we have cell cultures, big batches, 1000-litre or 2000-litre batches. We have cell cultures inside those batches and we inject them with the virus, the vaccine, if you will. Then those cells produce the vaccine, it’s a biotechnology protection. Now, some of those batches have very high yield and others have low yield. Particularly in Europe, we had one site with large capacity that experienced yield issues. So it's essentially a question of when you scale up to the level we are scaling up to - &nbsp;something like this that's never been done. We are scaling up to hundreds of millions, billions of doses of vaccines at a very high speed".</p></div>

<div><p>“A year ago, we didn't have a vaccine. When you do that, you have glitches, you have scale-up problems. Therefore, the yield varies from one to three, by the factor of three. The best site we have produces three times more vaccine out of a batch than the lowest producing site. We do this with a series of partners: in the US, those partners are actually approved by BARDA, the US administration, the group that manages those things and manages the capacity”.</p></div><p>
"In the US, we also have issues of yield and essentially our engineers have worked with our partners to identify what the issues are. We believe we have sorted out the issues now. The issues are different, for instance, in Belgium: we believe it was more a question of downstream filtering because when you finish making the vaccine, you have to filter it. When you filter it, you put it into vials.&nbsp;Our partner in Australia for instance also had yield issues. And they have been in the vaccine business for 20 years. But it's complicated, especially in the early phase where you have to really kind of sort out all sorts of issues. We believe we've sorted out those issues, but we are basically two months behind where we wanted to be. We've had also teething issues like this in the UK supply chain.&nbsp;But the UK contract was signed three months before the European vaccine deal. So with the UK we have&nbsp; had an extra three months to fix all the glitches we experienced. As for Europe, we are three months behind in fixing those glitches. Would I like to do better? Of course. But, you know, if we deliver in February what we are planning to deliver, it's not a small volume. We are planning to deliver millions of doses to Europe, it is not small”.</p>

<div><p><strong>You say that EU is going to receive a reasonable quantity of doses by February. Could you please quantify this?</strong><br>
"First of all, as soon as we get an approval by EMA, in the next few days, we will be shipping at least three million doses immediately to Europe, then we'll have another shipment about a week later and then the third or fourth week of February. And the target is to deliver 17 million doses by February. So, I am just estimating roughly, that would mean like about 3 million doses for Germany, probably 2,5 million for Italy and something like 2 million for Spain. I don't know exactly what the precise allocation is, but it's based on the population of each country. If you're in Germany, you can vaccinate three million people in one month. It's actually not so bad especially for the people who are the most exposed and most at risk. That's not a small proportion. And if you apply the three month regimen, then in March, you can do the same again or more potentially because we are working hard to increase our goals. It's not as good as we would like to, but it's really it's not so bad”.</p><p>
&nbsp;
<strong>So Europe signed the contract too late, instead of the UK?</strong><br>
“I will not pass judgment on this. But I can only tell you the facts and the facts are that we basically signed an agreement with the UK three months before we did have it with Europe. Now, part of this can be easily explained. When we entered the agreement with Oxford, they had already been working with the UK government on this. So they had a head start. We were able to quite quickly take the UK supply chain and improve it. We had to modify the formula in the process, because Oxford gave us a process that needed to be modified to enable manufacturing at scale.&nbsp;Just think about, we've done all of this in months. Usually, it takes years. We got a manufacturing process that Oxford gave us, which was producing a good vaccine, but not at an industrial scale. It was just able to produce quantities for clinical trials. So then we had to modify the process to turn it into a process that could manufacture billions of doses. At a cost that is reasonable and at a speed that is reasonable".</p><p>
&nbsp;
"We had to change all of these. Then we had to do what we call technology transfer. So we go to each partner and we train them on the process. We train them on how to manufacture. And then, you know, some people are new to this process. It's like they learn the process. They don't know how to make the vaccine and they're not as efficient as others".</p><p>
&nbsp;
"So you may have lower productivity. That's why we have a productivity going from one to three. And so, unfortunately, it's really bad luck. Actually, there's nothing mysterious about it. But look, the sites that have the lowest productivity in the network are the sites that are supplying Europe. And quite honestly, I mean, we're not doing it on purpose. I'm European, I have Europe at heart. Our chairman is Swedish, is European. Our CFO is European. Many people in the management are European. So we want to treat Europe as best we can. You know, we do this at no profit, remember? We didn't go into this to try and make money or whatever. We would like to treat Europe as good as possible. I actually do believe we treated Europe fairly". &nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
"Now, let me give you another number. Our total capacity globally now is about 100 million doses a month.&nbsp;From February onwards we are able to make 100 million doses a month, that's not small. Most vaccines have 100 million doses a year, that already takes us on a 1,2 billion pace per year. We are going to keep growing. Of course, we are ramping up production and Europe is getting 17 percent of this global production in February for a population that is 5 percent of the world population.&nbsp; Now, from the beginning we took very seriously the approach that Europe took, which we thought was fair and we all took. In fact, the US didn't say that Europe said that. Europe said the vaccine is common good and everybody needs to get access at the same time globally. That's what we are doing. Europe is getting 17 percent of our global supply for a month for 5 percent of the world population. The problem is: 100 million doses is a lot, but we have 7,5 billion people in the world".</p><p>
&nbsp;
"We are in the ramp-up phase and basically it will improve, but it takes time. Having said all of this, I'm not looking for excuses, honestly.&nbsp; We take accountability. We want to do better and we're working day and night. Our people in manufacturing, we have hundreds of people, thousands of people now. Many of them didn't take any Christmas vacation. I'm not asking you feel sorry for us but you know, we're doing our very best. But it's a very complicated process and a big scale”. &nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
<strong>After the explanation you just gave at the same time it is striking the aggressive way which the EU has responded, even threatning to impose a new control on exports of activity out of Europe. Some are suggesting that you're selling your product to some other countries.&nbsp; </strong><br>
“The suggestion we sell to other countries to make more money is not right because we make no profit everywhere.That's the approach we took and we agreed on that. That’s the agreement we have with Oxford University.&nbsp;It's actually even written in a contract we have with Oxford University: that we will be at no profit. We have slightly different prices from one geographic to the other because the cost of goods may be different. We have a supply chain in Brazil, we have another one in Latin America, another one in South Asia. We have one in Japan. Of course, you know, local costs are different. So you've got slight variations, but more or less, it's about three to four dollars, more or less everywhere.&nbsp;It makes no difference. Zero difference. I understand we all want to be vaccinated. I think the populations of Europe, like everywhere else in the world, have been under so much stress with this pandemic for so long …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>Clean code is like clean garbage – it’s only truly clean if it doesn’t exist. In other words, the only clean code is <a aria-label="no code (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">no code</a>. Let’s start with an acknowledgment that a perfectly clean (empty) codebase is useless. With that in mind, our pursuit of clean code will necessarily consist of tradeoffs. We’ll trade usefulness for cleanliness, complexity for speed, ownership for ease of development, and abstractions for reusability.</p>
<p>DRY (don’t repeat yourself) code is often held aloft as an ideal in the quest for clean code. Before we jump in too deep, let me shamelessly plug my new computer science learning platform <a href="https://qvault.io/">Qvault</a>, check it out if you like CS and like to write code. With that over with, let’s explore why I think DRY can be a good <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/11/30/examples-of-heuristics-in-computer-science/">heuristic</a>, but far from an absolute.</p>
<h2>What is DRY Code?</h2>
<p>According to <a aria-label="Wikipedia (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Don’t repeat yourself</strong>&nbsp;is a principle aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns,&nbsp;replacing it with abstractions or using&nbsp;data normalization&nbsp;to avoid redundancy. Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.</p></blockquote>
<p>While this definition is fairly exhaustive, what I’ve found people <em>usually</em> mean when they say “DRY code” is that when you find yourself repeating pieces of logic you should instead create a reusable function, interface, class, etc, so that you only have to maintain one copy of it. For example, take the following API calls:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">export async function updateUserHandle(handle) {
  if (!isLoggedIn()){
    // redirect to login screen
    return;
  }
  let token = localStorage.getItem(jwtKey);
  let decodedToken = decodeJWT(token);
  const hoursDelta = 24;
  if (decodedToken.exp &lt; (Date.now() + hoursDelta*60*60) / 1000){
    refreshToken();
  }
  return await fetch(`${domain}/v1/users/handle`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      handle
    })
  });
}

export async function updateUserInterests(interestUUIDs) {
  if (!isLoggedIn()){
    // redirect to login screen
    return;
  }
  let token = localStorage.getItem(jwtKey);
  let decodedToken = decodeJWT(token);
  const hoursDelta = 24;
  if (decodedToken.exp &lt; (Date.now() + hoursDelta*60*60) / 1000){
    refreshToken();
  }
  return await fetch(`${domain}/v1/users/interests`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      interestUUIDs
    })
  });
}</code></pre>
<p>You may have noticed, but the beginning of those two API calls are nearly identical – they handle some basic logic that checks to see if the user is properly authenticated and sends that authentication in the request. This might not be a big deal with just two API calls, but what if we have 30? Or maybe 1000? Instead, we can DRY up this code by writing a simple <code>fetchWithAuth</code> function that will centralize all the client’s authentication logic in a single place:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">async function fetchWithAuth(url, params){
  if (!isLoggedIn()){
    // redirect to login screen
    return;
  }
  let token = localStorage.getItem(jwtKey);
  let decodedToken = decodeJWT(token);
  const hoursDelta = 24;
  if (decodedToken.exp &lt; (Date.now() + hoursDelta*60*60) / 1000){
    refreshToken();
  }
  if (!params.headers){
    params.headers = {};
  }
  params.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
  return await fetch(url, params);
}

export async function updateUserHandle(handle) {
  return await fetchWithAuth(`${domain}/v1/users/handle`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      handle
    })
  });
}

export async function updateUserInterests(interestUUIDs) {
  return await fetchWithAuth(`${domain}/v1/users/interests`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      interestUUIDs
    })
  });
}</code></pre>
<h2>Why wouldn’t you DRY out your code?</h2>
<p>Seems like a good idea to reduce code duplication right? Well, yes, in general it is. That said, lets look at some of the drawbacks that come along with too much centralization.</p>
<h3>1. Too many abstractions</h3>
<p>Sometimes code is the same at a given point in time, but later on, it becomes distinct in some way. It’s really hard to guarantee that duplicate code will remain perfect copies of each other forever. A hypothetical example of this would be if the Facebook and Instagram APIs had the exact same way to create a social post. Just because they’re <em>coincidentally</em> the same, probably doesn’t mean that the logic should only be written once.</p>
<p>The solution is likely to remain disciplined about splitting out code that, while it may be similar, is only <em>coincidentally</em> similar. Try to only merge code that’s <em>fundamentally</em> the same. A great example would be a math function like <code>log2</code>. That function should work for every case that you need to calculate a logarithm – each call is fundamentally the same.</p>
<h3>2. External dependency creation</h3>
<p>If two different projects share the same logic, it can often make sense to centralize it in a library package. While this is often a great idea, it can add overhead and can end up being more trouble than it’s worth. For example, even if the abstraction makes sense, you’re definitely adding at least the following complexity to the project:</p>
<ul><li>Management of the dependencies versions and running updates regularly</li><li>Requires multi-project updates in order to get a new change to a specific dependent</li><li>Often involves more remote infrastructure like NPM or PyPy</li><li>Gets harder to make “breaking” changes to the libraries core functions – requires a higher standard of code quality and architecture</li></ul>
<h3>3. Localization complexity</h3>
<p>When debugging or reading code, it would be easiest if the flow of logic started at the top of a file and flowed in a linear path. For example:</p>
<pre><code>START PROGRAM
INSTRUCTION 0
INSTRUCTION 1
INSTRUCTION 2
INSTRUCTION 3
END PROGRAM</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, in useful programs, we need functions, classes, methods, type definitions, etc. that force us to read and write code in a non-linear way. The goal should be to keep everything as linear as possible and sacrifice linearity and simplicity for reusability and separation of concerns as necessary. Every time we extract a chunk of code from a larger function into a smaller more encapsulated one, the code becomes just a little bit harder to follow.</p>
<p>With a highly compartmentalized project, when we see a function called <code>getUser</code>, if we want to <em>really</em> know what’s going on we have to peek into that function and remember the current context because we’re now looking at a different file. Obviously, the cognitive burden becomes greater and greater the more definitions you need to jump through.</p>
<h2>Takeaways – Code smells and hueristics</h2>
<p>Since no code is perfect, we can need to make use of some heuristics (rules of thumb), to try to work towards a cleaner codebase.</p>
<h3>1. WET code, or the rule of three</h3>
<p>WET is a better rule of thumb in my opinion than DRY.</p>
<p>WET stands for “write everything twice”, and forces you to think a bit harder about whether or not a piece of logic deserves an abstraction. The rule of three is an alternative that says you should even wait until you’ve written something three times before breaking it out.</p>
<h3>2. Is it testable?</h3>
<p>Most functions should be predictable and testable. They should behave like math functions or <a aria-label="pure functions (opens in a new tab)" href="https://qvault.io/2020/09/07/how-to-make-pure-functions-in-go/#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20Pure%20Function,of%20data%20outside%20the%20function)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">pure functions</a> – given a set of inputs you’ll always receive the same outputs, and the state of the program isn’t mutated. If the code you’re thinking about condensing into a function can be a pure function, then it’s likely a better idea than if it were an impure function.</p>
<p>Pure functions are really easy to write good unit tests for – if your abstraction is easily testable it’s more likely to be a good abstraction.</p>
<h3>3. Are there special cases or arguments only used by a fraction of callers?</h3>
<p>Take a look at the following example:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">function getArea(height, width){
  return height * width
}</code></pre>
<p>This is a great function! Its very simple, and obviously can be used to calculate the area of any shape. Here’s a bad example:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">function getArea(height, width, isTriangle){
  if (isTriangle){
    return (height * width) / 2
  }
  return height * width
}</code></pre>
<p>Special cases are bad news – I’m trying to be too abstract. Instead I should just create two separate functions:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">function getTriangleArea(height, width){
  return (height * width) / 2
}

function getRectangleArea(height, width){
  return height * width
}</code></pre>
<p>Have any more ideas for good rules of thumb? Let me know on <a href="https://twitter.com/wagslane" target="_blank" aria-label="Twitter (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter</a>! I’d love to update and improve this article.</p>

    <p>Turing machine programs are sometimes represented as directed graphs. The vertices of the graph are the program’s states and the edges are transitions between states. The program’s print and shift instructions are relegated to being labels for the edges. Here’s an example:</p>

<p><img src="https://nickdrozd.github.io/assets/2021-01-26-spaghetti-code-conjecture/green-graph.png" alt="img"></p>

<p>Suppose you have a Turing machine diagram, but you don’t have access to the print and shift instructions. All you have is the graph of the states and their transitions. I don’t know why you don’t have the prints and shifts, but you don’t. Maybe you’re looking at the diagram on an overhead projection and you forgot your glasses. Maybe the diagram was drawn on a whiteboard and somebody walked past and bumped into it and wiped away the instructions. Maybe you had the program on a deck of punch cards but you dropped them and the cards got out of order and now all you can recover are the state transitions. Way to go, you klutz. Try a rubber band next time.</p>

<p>What can you tell about a program given only its state transitions? Certainly it isn’t possible to figure out exactly what the progam does. There’s no way to tell how the machine will interact with the tape. But the program’s logical structure can be discerned. Look at the example above. States 1 and 2 do some kind of initialization for state 3. States 3, 4 and 5 form a loop. States 5, 6 and 7 form another loop. The 3-4-5 can, based on a decision made at state 5, extend to include 5-6-7 loop.</p>

<p>Why was 6 afraid of 7? Becase 7 ate 9. Neden 4 5 korkuyor? Çünkü 5 6 yedi. The one-two-three cat made it across the river, but the un-deux-trois cat sank.</p>

<p>Busy Beaver programs have state transition graphs too. What do you think they would look like in general? What kinds of properties would you expect a Busy Beaver graph to have?</p>

<p>As far as I know, this question was first posed by Joshua Zelinsky <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4916#comment-1850560">in a blog comment</a>. It seems like an obvious question when you hear it, but I haven’t seen any evidence that anyone had ever thought much about Busy Beaver graphs before that. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.03184.pdf">James Harland</a> pointed out that Busy Beaver graphs can’t be <em>disconnected</em> (that is, that there can’t be two nodes between which there is no undirected path), but didn’t go any further. <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/147554934.pdf">Ludewig, Schult, and Wankmüller</a> compiled an appendix of 100 long-running 5-state programs, each accompanied by a hand-drawn state transition diagram. Look at these nice graphs:</p>

<p><img src="https://nickdrozd.github.io/assets/2021-01-26-spaghetti-code-conjecture/uwe-graphs.png" alt="img"></p>

<p>They went to all the trouble of drawing all those diagrams, but their report doesn’t mention the graphs at all. Why not?<sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Zelinsky conjectured that all Busy Beavers graphs are <em>strongly connected</em> (that is, that for any two nodes, there is a directed route from one to the other). Call this the <strong>strongly connected graph conjecture</strong>. <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/bb.pdf">Scott Aaronson</a> made a broader and vaguer proposal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A related intuition, though harder to formalize, is that Busy Beavers shouldn’t be “cleanly factorizable” into main routines and subroutines – but rather, that the way to maximize runtime should be via “spaghetti code,” or a single n-state amorphous mass.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the <strong>Spaghetti Code Conjecture</strong>. On top of spaghetti, all covered with cheese, is the longest-running program of some fixed length. Like Aaronson says, it isn’t a formal statement. It’s a stand-in for a set of formal statements. It implies the strongly connected graph conjecture, for instance, and other statements too. Which statements? That’s a research program. Or maybe it’s a research programme.</p>

<p>I’ll say more about the Spaghetti Code Conjecture, but before that I want to look at an application. And before <em>that</em> I want to say something about the nature of “spaghetti code”.</p>

<p>It’s sometimes defined as code that uses <code>goto</code> statements. But that isn’t right. <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.103.6084&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Donald Knuth</a> uses <code>goto</code> in his programs, and he doesn’t write spaghetti code. “Spaghetti” is a logical property, not a syntactical one. It means that the code’s control flow is <em>convoluted</em> or <em>unduly complex</em>. It’s not enough for the control flow to be just <em>complex</em>, it has to be <em>unduly</em> complex. If the code is modeling something that is complex using control flow that is simple, it’s probably wrong. Spaghetti code has a control flow that is more complex than it needs to be.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, a lot of code that is written by professional programmers is spaghetti. Shocking, I know, but true. Spaghetti code is often not created intentionally. It can result from carelessness, or even a lack of taste. Here are two ways of setting a variable to some conditionally chosen value:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>## ternary expression ##################
</span>
<span>var</span> <span>=</span> <span>this</span><span>()</span> <span>if</span> <span>test</span><span>()</span> <span>else</span> <span>that</span><span>()</span>

<span>## if / else ###########################
</span>
<span>if</span> <span>test</span><span>():</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>=</span> <span>this</span><span>()</span>
<span>else</span><span>:</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>=</span> <span>that</span><span>()</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The ternary expression is obviously the better choice here. It has a simpler control flow. One assign statement, one path. The if-else block has two assign statements, each executed on a separate path. It’s spaghetti-er than the ternary. It’s also much more common. Is that a coincidence? A general lack of taste would explain the correlation. It could explain some other things too.</p>

<p>It really isn’t accurate to describe a Busy Beaver program as “spaghetti”. Spaghetti has a flimsy structure, great for slurping. You wouldn’t want to eat something with the structure of a Busy Beaver program. It would be unpleasant going down and unpleasant coming back up. And make no mistake, it would come back up.</p>

<p>Anyway, on to the application of the Spaghetti Code Conjecture. A program can be converted to a state transition graph by ignoring its print and shift instructions and considering only the states. Now go the other direction. Given an <em>n</em>-state <em>k</em>-color state transition graph, how many concrete programs correspond to it? In other words, how many ways are there to decorate the graph with print and shift instructions? There are <em>nk</em> transitions. Ignoring <a href="https://nickdrozd.github.io/2020/10/04/turing-machine-notation-and-normal-form.html">normalization</a>, each transition gets a left or right shift and one of the <em>k</em> colors. That makes <em>2k</em> decorations per transition, and so <em>2nk<sup>2</sup></em> programs per graph. Is that right? I hope so. That means 40 programs per graph in the ❺② case, and 54 programs per graph in the ❸③ case.</p>

<p>This fact can be applied to Busy Beaver searching. The naive search method generates all <em>n</em>-state <em>k</em>-color programs and then searches them. But the total number of programs gets out of hand fast, growing on the order of <em>O((nk)<sup>nk</sup>)</em>. A better way to do it is to generate the possible graphs first and then decorate them with instructions. The Spaghetti Code Conjecture can then be used at graph-generation time to discard graphs that seem unsuitable. (How many program graphs are strongly connected? I have no idea. That’s a sophisticated calculation, and I don’t know what I’m doing.) Discarding a few graphs means discarding a whole swath of programs. It can’t be overemphasized how many programs there are. Discarding them is like bailing water out of a ship. There is no choice but to get rid of a lot of them, and as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>This isn’t just idle speculation. I used the <em>graph decoration</em> technique along with Zelinsky’s strongly connected graph conjecture to find <a href="https://nickdrozd.github.io/2020/10/09/beeping-busy-beaver-results.html">the reigning ❹② Beeping Busy Beaver champion</a>. The conjecture has predictive power! So as far as <em>I’m</em> concerned, its value has already been proved.</p>

<p>Wait, did somebody say “proved”? Like, the conjecture has been formally proved? No, of course not. I doubt it can be proved at all. It might even be provably unprovable. But it could nevertheless be true. Busy Beaver searchers are interested in establishing lower bounds, not upper bounds. If a conjecture leads to better lower bounds, that’s good enough.</p>

<p>How much wood would a woodchuck chuck? Would a beaver eat spaghetti? Raccoons sure do love rummaging through my trash, I can tell you that.</p>

<p>Here’s an argument that the strongly connected graph conjecture is true. It’s not a real proof, just a suggestive argument. Argument by induction on the number states, with fixed <em>k</em> colors. 0- or 1-state programs are trivial and/or degenerate, so start with the base case of 2 states, <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>. Busy Beaver programs run on the blank tape, so the program starts in transition <code>A0</code>. If it stays in state <code>A</code>, then it will remain on transition <code>A0</code> forever, and is therefore junk. So <code>A0</code> must transition to <code>B</code>. Does <code>B</code> have any connections to <code>A</code>? If it doesn’t, then the program will spend the rest of its execution time in its <em>k</em> <code>B</code> transitions, and won’t be able to use the full <em>2k</em> transitions available. But surely such a program can’t be the ❷ⓚ Busy Beaver. Kinda QED on the base case. Next, the induction step. The <em>n</em>-state Busy Beaver is strongly connected. What about the <em>n+1</em>-state Busy Beaver? Suppose it isn’t strongly connected. For simplicity, suppose also that <em>n+1</em> is the least number of states for a Busy Beaver program whose state graph is not strongly connected. Every Busy Beaver program through <em>n</em> states is strongly connected spaghetti, but then some kind of structure gets introduced at <em>n+1</em>? Why? What kind of structure? Why <em>n+1</em>, and not earlier or later? It seems unlikely. The inductive step is kinda done, and that takes care of the loosey-goosey informal argument.</p>

<p>So we think that Busy Beaver program graphs should be strongly connected. What other properties should they have? I’m now going to enter into the territory of rank speculation and propose a few properties that seem like they should hold. Some caveats:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Busy Beaver programs need to halt, and that means they need to include a halt state (exactly one, in fact). Inclusion of the halt state makes for a lot of exceptions to otherwise general statements. I don’t feel like making that explicit, so just assume that the exception is there. This doesn’t apply to Beeping Busy Beaver programs, because <a href="https://nickdrozd.github.io/2021/01/14/halt-quasihalt-recur.html">they don’t indicate program termination in such a clumsy fashion</a>. In general, <a href="https://oeis.org/A337025">halt-free programs</a> will have a more pleasing graph structure than programs with a halt instruction.</li>
  <li>These conjectures are meant to apply <em>n</em>-state programs where <em>n</em> is “sufficiently large”. This is great for the conjecturer, as it …</li></ol></div></article></div></div></div>

<p><em>“Out of every hundred men, ten shouldn’t be there, eighty are just targets”</em></p>

<p><em>Heraclitus 535 - 475 BC.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>My posts on <a href="https://blog.eutopian.io/winning-systems--security-practitioners-2.-preparation/">Winning Systems for Cyber Security Practitioners</a> are my most popular. In them, I attempt to change your perspective on the relative importance of products and <a href="https://blog.eutopian.io/forget-solving-the-cyber-security-skills-shortage/">skills</a> in securing what’s precious to you. I make the case for using systems <a href="https://blog.eutopian.io/winning-systems--security-practitioners-1.-introduction/">(in the broadest sense of the word)</a> not goals. Systems aren’t new. They pre-date the product-era of today. From infrastructure to code, you can count on them. Products and vendors come and go. Skills are irregular and scarce. It is systems that are eternal and universal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you’ve taken my advice, you’ve factored default-deny, responsiveness, robustness, and resilience into your thinking. This post is about minimising your attack surface. In it, I explain what this means and why it may be our best hope for reducing vulnerability in practice. Finally, I’ll tell you what the world might look like if we took this winning system to its ultimate logical conclusion. Before we get there let’s begin at the beginning.</p>

<h4 id="the-problem">The Problem</h4>

<h5 id="1-codebase-size-quality">1: Codebase Size &amp; Quality</h5>

<p>According to the Software Engineering Institute, software developed in the USA has about 6000 defects per million lines of source code (MLOC)<sup id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> for high-level languages like Java and C#. High-quality code has 600 to 1000 defects per MLOC. Code of exceptional quality developed with the highest levels of assurance exhibits defects below 600 per MLOC. Between 1% and 5% of those defects are thought to be security vulnerabilities<sup id="fnref:2"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. Let’s apply that research to some well-known codebases and see what the numbers look like.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Software</th>
<th>MLOC</th>
<th>Vulns. (high est.)</th>
<th>Vulns. (low est.)</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>FreeBSD</td>
<td>9</td>
<td>2700</td>
<td>54</td>

<td>9000</td>
<td>180</td>

<tr>
<td>Facebook</td>
<td>65</td>
<td>19500</td>
<td>390</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The low estimates don’t look bad. There’s no chance they apply here. Even the high rate may be too conservative for contemporary Internet-based applications. Most technology companies optimise for the shortest time to market, because they have competition. They optimise for flexibility, because they don’t know what they’re building until they find product/market fit. Security, stability, and ease of maintenance (the conventional measures of software quality) are not high on the list of priorities.</p>

<h5 id="2-tractability-distributedness">2: Tractability &amp; Distributedness</h5>

<p>MLOC is a simplistic measure. Modern Internet applications consist of a mixture of software from a long and complex supply chain. Partly Open Source. Partly licensed. Partly offshore. Partly of unknown origin. Some code recent. Some ancient. Some developed with great care. Some slapdash. Modern web applications draw upon software in the form of services from a dozen places. Your application may be partly distributed even though you think of it as centralised.</p>

<p>Consider this <a href="https://blog.eutopian.io/the-stack/">blog</a>. It has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx">web server</a> and an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD">Operating System</a>. It uses cosmetic client-side javascript. It has an external comment section. Fonts and cookies come from Google. I should say something about SSL and DNS services. Without these, the site wouldn’t function. All this attack surface for some static text that looks much as it would have in the 1980s. Its puny code is distributed and diverse. It doesn’t even offer an application in the conventional sense. The simplest things have a larger attack surface than you think. Some numbers:</p>

<thead>
<tr>

<th>MLOC</th>
<th>Vulns. (high est.)</th>
<th>Vulns. (low est.)</th>

</tbody>
</table>

<blockquote>
<p>For OpenSSL nobody believes 194 CVEs represent anything other than a small fraction of the actual vulnerabilities. OpenSSL is mature and supposedly security-critical. It has a highly exposed codebase. It has a single design-purpose. What do you think the vulnerability rate is like for the average piece of software? Our high estimates don’t look high after all.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="3-informal-methods">3: Informal Methods</h5>

<p>Some vulnerabilities are design weaknesses or logic errors. Not buffer overruns. Not input validation problems. Not statistical errors. Not side-channel attacks. They are precedence bugs, off-by-one bugs, or errant state machine misbehaviour. Not the kind of flaw that static analysis is good at spotting. Not the kind of flaw you can easily patch away.</p>

<h5 id="4-unintended-consequences">4: Unintended Consequences</h5>

<p>I’ve said nothing about deployment practices, configuration, or administration. Even if you aren’t a developer, there’s no shortage of ways you can expose or create vulnerability as a consequence of individual configuration choices. Software has many layers and many settings. Unintended consequences arise from interactions between these settings and layers. Defaults are frequently a poor choice. Even documentation is sometimes misleading in a way that jeopardises security.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As code breadth, depth, diversity, and distributedness increases, so does scope for errors and vulnerability. These four problems are the reason why software is insecure.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="good-news-bad-news-luck-judgement">Good News Bad News, Luck &amp; Judgement</h4>

<p>The news isn’t all bad. Some part of the odds falls in our favour.</p>

<ul>
<li>Not all vulnerabilities are exposed by default.</li>
<li>Not all exposed vulnerabilities are exposed to unprivileged users.</li>
<li>Not all exposed unprivileged user vulnerabilities end in system compromise.</li>
</ul>

<p>Experience tells us we can’t draw comfort from this. There are many winning systems but luck is not one of them.</p>

<ul>
<li>What was hidden from exposure can be inadvertently revealed.</li>
<li>What was inaccessible to unprivileged users can slip within their reach.</li>
<li>What looked like a tiny hole, turns out to be a secret passage into the castle.</li>
</ul>

<p>What about judgement? The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) improves software quality and with it security. However, it provides only a marginal reduction in total vulnerability once we consider the sum of a deepening stack, spiralling dependencies, and increasing distributedness and diversity of code within real applications. If software quality is order and flaws are disorder, disorder is still increasing at a faster rate than order can be imposed. This isn’t an argument against S-SDLC, DevSecOps, Formal Methods, or any other software quality initiative. It’s an observation that these things are not an adequate braking force. We continue to roll downhill towards greater overall vulnerability.</p>

<p>Consider “as a service” providers. They carry their own vulnerable software, which they may improve. They also carry the vulnerable “genes” of all the other components, products, and 3rd party services they build upon. They have no meaningful control over this inheritance and only partial influence over whether those genes are “expressed” in their particular formulation of an architecture or service. Soon software will be everywhere, inside everything. Much of it vulnerable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The winning system is, therefore, the relentless limitation of attack surface. Whether it be by design, development, or deployment. Preferably all three. Don’t wait for software quality to improve. Count on it remaining lousy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="reducing-attack-surface-in-practice">Reducing Attack Surface In Practice</h5>

<p>This series is for practitioners, but it talks of systems. It does so because practices co-evolve with technology and technology becomes obsolete, invalidating practices with it. You can watch this happen in real-time. Professionals, products, and  companies struggle to stay relevant when customers move from traditional physical infrastructure to cloud to serverless.</p>

<p>Winning systems are eternal. They transcend the tech-de-jour. The IT industry hasn’t grasped this. That’s why job descriptions are still packed with vendor and product names. It’s why product companies fail to talk a language that business understands. It’s why I still think a classical Computer Science and Software Engineering background helps. It separates pristine theory from messy, proprietary, and perishable practice.</p>

<p>So let’s start with the pristine theory first before getting dirty with practices:</p>

<ul>
<li>For software which you must expose, expose only a small part.</li>
<li>For that small part:

<ul>
<li>Expose it only to a constrained group of users.</li>
<li>Expose only a necessary subset of its functionality.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For that subset:

<ul>
<li>Eliminate complexity, making it as simple as possible.</li>
<li>Apply the winning systems of least-privilege and default-deny.</li>
<li>If a given function can be achieved in a less risky way, take it.</li>
<li>Where complexity is unavoidable, treat that software with suspicion.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Remove unused or vestigial elements, they are a liability.</li>
</ul>

<p>The practical extent to which one can limit attack surface is case-specific. It depends upon the level of control you have over the software in question and the environment within which it runs. However, everyone can do something to limit their attack surface, even if your control is limited to that of a network or systems administrator.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><strong>^^^ PLEASE USE POST USING ABOVE LINK FOR MY “ONE-LINE IT JUST WORKS” ^^^</strong><br>
(IGNORE EVERYTHING BELLOW THIS AS IT’S THE ORIGINAL DEVELOPMENT WORK)<br>
===================================================================</p>
<p><strong>Everything from this point down is out of date as of: 3-30-2020</strong></p>
<p>This was my initial “netflix on the raspberry pi 4 development” blog post. Leaving it on here due to the comments, initial work, info for those interested, but I highly recommend using the easy method above (linked).</p>
<p>Last libwidevine extract: 3-29-2020 – v.4.10.1610.6 of libwidevine – EVERYTHING CONFIRMED WORKING</p>
<p><em><br>
Chromium has made substantial changes the way libwidevine (and a few major things around DRM) are loaded/used/etc. They have also made changes to the setting and reading of the user-agent propagation. For some time (~2 months or so) — the combination of this badly broke Netflix. It seems they have undone the lib loading in the last couple of versions, and user @Spartacuss discovered the user-agent fix.</em></p><p><em>The instructions here (as of 3-29-2020) work for: Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Disney+, Amazon Prime, Spotify, Pandora, and many others.</em></p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi 4 model with 4GB of RAM is the first cheap hardware that can provide a real “desktop-like” experience when browsing the web/watching Netflix/etc. However, if you have tried to run Netflix on the Pi, you have quickly entered the disgusting mess that exists around DRM, WideVine (Netflix being one example of something that needs it), and Chromium.</p>
<p>After hours and hours of effort, I finally discovered a quick and elegant solution that lets you use the <strong>latest default provided Chromium browser</strong>, without having to recompile anything in order to watch any WideVine/DRM (Netflix, Spotify, etc) content.</p>
<h2>Background and the DRM Problem</h2>
<p>If you are not familiar with this, the short version is that Netflix (and many others, ex: Spotify) use the WideVine “Content Protection System” – aka DRM, and if you want to watch Netflix or something else that uses it, you need to have a WideVine plugin+browse supported integration. Chrome, Firefox, and Safari make it available for x86/amd64 systems, but not for ARM since technically they don’t have ARM builds.</p>
<p>Chromium, the project Chrome is based on, does have an ARM build, but it does not include any DRM support, and technically it does not include widevine support by default (*caveat here, which helps us later)<br>
So long story short, the question becomes “how do you enable DRM/WideVine support in Chromium?”.</p>
<p>It seems there are two main solutions out there: use an old (v51, 55, 56, 60) version of Chromium which has been “patched” with widevine support (kusti8’s version seems to be the most popular one – except since the new Netflix changes, that also does not work), which requires uninstalling the latest Chromium available, installing the old/patched one, and dropping in older widevine plugins; the second option is to use Vivaldi – a proprietary fork of Opera which also has been “sort of patched”, but it still needs a valid libwidevinecdm plugin (see bellow) and it has it’s own issues (and also…it’s Opera…in 2019…who uses Opera?)</p>
<p>After a lot of research and trial and error, I discovered a much more elegant solution – use the extracted ChromeOS (armv7l – yay) binaries and insert them into Chromium + make everything think it’s ChromeOS (user agent)</p>
<h2>Netflix/Hulu/Spotify with the Default Raspberry Pi Chromium Browser</h2>

<p><strong>Enough theory – let’s do this in 2 quick steps!</strong><br>
0.) If you have tried Netflix/etc already, open Chromium and clear your browser history + cookies. Otherwise it will cache the “failed” DRM components.</p>
<p><strong>1.) Download the latest extracted ChromeOS <a href="http://blog.vpetkov.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/libwidevinecdm.so_.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">libwidevine</a> binary and extract it:</strong></p><!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

<p><strong>2.) Completely QUIT all Chromium windows.</strong><br>
Start Chromium with the new Application Menu under “Internet”: <strong>Chromium (Media Edition)</strong><br>
<del datetime="2020-03-30T00:52:10+00:00">Open a new tab, and go to: https://bitmovin.com/demos/drm You should be able to see the movie on the left. </del>(While this still works, it will show “No DRM” unless you set the Chromium user-agent from within the app – which breaks Netflix. BitMoving unfortunately looks for that first. Just go to Netflix/Your media source directly.)<br>
You can now play Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Spotify, Pandora, Disney+, Amazon Prime, and many others!</p>
<p>Please note that If you can see the video on the left, this means the DRM plugin has worked! From this point on, anything that does not work (ex: Netflix sometimes breaks after a browser update) is due to the site specifically filtering User Agents/doing other “tricks”. So for example, if Netflix does not work, Spotify, Pandora, Hulu, Amazon Prime, HBO, etc will still work. <del datetime="2020-03-30T00:52:10+00:00">The BitMovin website is the “real” test on wether the DRM plugin has worked.</del>(While still technically true, if your Chromium user-agent is not set from within the app itself, which breaks Netflix, BitMovin will show “No DRM” even though the DRM decryption works)</p>

<p>It seems the Pi’s raw CPU frequency is still not powerful enough for decoding 100% of the time. While 97-98% of the time is good enough, you will get the occasional “screen tearing” (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing), especially in scenes with fast motion.</p>
<p><del datetime="2020-04-07T04:18:34+00:00">Users Otaku, DM (and thanks to Luca for testing/extra info!) have found a solution which was mentioned on https://lb.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=246179 by user Greysvandir.<br>
I had to add a few more things and I created a compressed and slightly automated 😉 version:<br>
# sudo apt install -f compton<br>
$ mkdir -p ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi<br>
$ cd ~/.config &amp;&amp; wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dastorm/Compton-xfce-config/master/compton.conf<br>
$ cp -f /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart<br>
$ echo “@usr/bin/compton –backend glx” &gt;&gt; ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart<br>
$ echo “xrandr –output HDMI-1 –mode 1280×720” &gt;&gt; ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart<br>
The result is no tearing with 1080p@60fps video.<br>
</del></p>
<p><strong>(OPTIONAL) Get libwidevinecdm version</strong><br>
If you want to check your *actual* libwidevinecdm version, the easiest and quickest way is using user VMX’s elegant python solution:</p>

<p>Launching is hard. The product is never polished “enough”. There are always a hundred more tasks to be completed, and in the midst of a pandemic, it can seem impossible to get a product to the finish line.<br></p>
<p>Yet, we persevered.&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>We set a deadline of April 30th 2020 for our <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/tara-ai-1-0">v1.0</a>, and were all cylinders go, with dozens of completed sprints and pull requests from our team and 50 other teams in our early alpha. Best case scenario: my co-founder Syed and I expected a hundred other teams to sign up within a few weeks. Instead, post launch, thousands of workspaces were activated. In short, we were completely blown away by the response.<br></p>
<br>
<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dx44N4Jx3MeU-ccCvlLrdVZC79artXQ-ORaLC_l5q287H8w1bUvHZLHRkORWcbfdPEjk6B5aJhSJDmkv_moWoJ2hQufI-mas3TJrhN5gIXowR4rINJ0nd4oBaingIQ-dmErRs72M" alt=""></figure></div>

<p>Quickly, Tara AI went to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23033387">page 1 of Hacker News</a> and the outpouring of love and support began. We realized how large of a problem we had truly set to solve, and in 8 months, 20,000 of you worked with Tara to deliver:&nbsp;<br></p>
<ul><li>100,000 tasks</li><li>25,000 sprints</li><li>15,000 product requirements and</li><li>7,000 Github connections</li></ul>

<p>We heard from so many of you how you switched from the “clunk” of Jira, the “mess” of Asana, and how a tool that was built by engineers (for engineers) became your team’s “superpower” to develop and release faster.&nbsp;<br></p>

This is a decade-old concept that needs to end, 1- click is all it should take to start and run a sprint, or connect your project management software to source control.<br></p>
<p><strong>Tara will provide visibility and speed </strong>as you move quickly to deliver software. You should be able to zoom in/out within different concepts in your product delivery assembly line, and the tool should get out of your way as you deliver software.<br></p>
<p><strong>Tara should add predictability</strong> to your workflow. Predictably helping your team deliver on their tasks, sprints or pull requests, and providing indicators to do so. Continually delivering on your sprints, helps you deliver on your team’s monthly product milestones, which adds up to delivery on annual business goals for your organizations. In short, predictability in effort completed, and estimating effort, becomes integral to delivering on release timelines.</p>

<p><strong>So what’s next?</strong><br></p>
<p>In 2020, we received over 520 feature requests from a highly active community of power users via Intercom, email and our slack group. And, we saw sprints being created in just over 15 different languages. In 2021, we’re delivering:<br></p>
<p><strong>A smarter Tara.</strong>&nbsp;Developers have to manually change statuses and constantly provide updates to the rest of their team, to move tasks across the development pipeline. We’re building automation that works intuitively with your source control and development workflow, so that your tasks flow from branch creation (TODO) to merged pull requests (DONE). Teams will be able to provide their DOD (definition of done) and automatically move tasks in the hand-off from development to QA, from one engineer to the next.</p>
<p><strong>An improved interface. </strong>We’re making it even easier to search and filter through the platform with smart labels, to help prioritize your work. We’re also working on a new navigation that makes it faster to create tasks, product requirements or sprints, at any level, as your team delivers software from specification to release.<br></p>
<p><strong>Larger teams. </strong>Today, Tara is optimized for workspaces and teams of up to 30 developers. We’ve mindfully crafted the experience for small teams, yet we continue to hear from larger teams that are anxiously waiting to make the switch to Tara. Moving forward, we’re building functionality to support access controls and user management, along with reporting and quarterly/monthly milestone setting. Our mobile experience is also a part of this roadmap.<br></p>
<p><strong>More integrations. </strong>We’ve shipped several updates to our Github integration, alongside a new Gitlab integration. Next up, we’re working on more source control connections, to welcome teams from Bitbucket and other platforms. We’re also releasing our full-fledged Slack app, with reporting functionality and task creation, directly from Slack.</p>

<p>And, there’s more. We have an even larger roster of updates planned for 2021. To deliver on this ambitious roadmap, <a href="https://tara.ai/about/careers/">we’re hiring</a> engineers, designers and scientists looking to change productivity for developers.&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>We’re excited to see what you will continue to build with Tara. Here’s to our customers.</p>
<p>Onwards and upwards.</p>

			<p>The station’s atmosphere is maintained at pressure comfortable for the crew members, and a tiny bit of that air leaks over time, requiring routine repressurization from nitrogen tanks delivered on cargo resupply missions. In September 2019, NASA and its international partners first saw indications of a slight increase above the standard cabin air leak rate. The leak has presented no immediate danger to the crew or the space station. The crew isolated sections of the station to monitor pressure changes to find and repair this air leak starting in August 2020.</p>
<p>The Distran Ultra Pro acoustic camera displays the leak location and estimates equivalent pinhole leakage rates and limit of detection in real-time. This Swiss-made technology detects ultrasounds emitted by air flow as it rushes through small holes, seams, and cracks. The acoustic imaging is overlaid on an optical image in real time, offering clear pinpointing of leaks. Ultra Pro records vacuum and jetting ultrasounds emitted by any type of leak (steam, CO2, CH4, H2, etc.) offering a wide range of applications.</p>
<p>Tests have shown that Ultra Pro’s leak detection abilities are not impaired when the frequencies of noise-source energy are sufficiently far from the test frequency. Not all leaks produce ultrasound at the same frequency, and user selection of frequencies from 10-55 kHz is facilitated by an integrated, real-time spectrogram display. The Ultra Pro can potentially locate partially obstructed, hard-to-reach, or hidden leaks, potentially providing a great advantage as the ISS modules are filled with equipment racks, piping, cables, and experiment payloads.</p>
<p>Distran technology has been in use since 2013, mostly in the oil &amp; gas industry, chemical manufacturing, and power plants. This versatile device, which can also pinpoint partial discharges, saves time and gas or electric consumable costs as well as it provides a safe manner to check for leaks from a distance.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>When you develop a Python project, you need to install the project's dependencies. For a long time, tutorials and articles have told you to use a virtual environment to isolate the project's dependencies. This way you don't contaminate the working set of other projects, or the global interpreter, to avoid possible version conflicts. We usually have to do these things:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ python3 -m venv venv  
$ <span>.</span> venv/bin/activate   
<span>(</span>venv<span>)</span> $ pip <span>install</span> -r requirements.txt  </code></pre></div>
<p>There are also workflow tools that simplify this process, such as <a href="https://pipenv.pypa.io/">Pipenv</a> and <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a>. They create virtual environments for you without perception and then install dependencies into them. They are used by a wide range of users. A virtual environment contains a Python interpreter and has the same directory structure as a normal installation so that it can be used as if it were a standalone Python installation.</p>
<h2 id="the-problems-with-virtual-environments"><a href="#the-problems-with-virtual-environments" aria-label="the problems with virtual environments permalink"></a>The problems with virtual environments</h2>
<p>Virtualenvs help us isolate project dependencies, but things get tricky when it comes to nested venvs: One installs the virtualenv manager(like Pipenv or Poetry) using a venv encapsulated Python, and creates more venvs using the tool which is based on an encapsulated Python. One day a minor release of Python is out and one has to check all those venvs and upgrade them if required before they can safely delete the out-dated Python version.</p>
<p>Another scenario is global tools. There are many tools that are not tied to any specific virtualenv and are supposed to work with each of them. Examples are profiling tools and third-party REPLs. We also wish them to be installed in their own isolated environments. It's impossible to make them work with virtualenv, even if you have activated the virtualenv of the target project you want to work on because the tool is lying in its own virtualenv and it can only see the libraries installed in it. So we have to install the tool for each project.</p>
<p>I've been maintaining the Pipenv project as a collaborator for the past two years and became a member of PyPA in early 2020. I am always thinking if the virtual environment is really a must-to-have for Python projects, just like <code>npm</code>, it doesn't need a cloned <code>node</code> binary, but just a <code>node_modules</code> directory that is unique for each project.</p>
<h2 id="pep-582----python-local-packages-directory"><a href="#pep-582----python-local-packages-directory" aria-label="pep 582    python local packages directory permalink"></a>PEP 582 -- Python local packages directory</h2>
<p>The solution has been existing for a long time. <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0582/">PEP 582</a> was originated in 2018 and is still a draft proposal till the time I wrote this article, but I found out it is exactly what <code>node_modules</code> are in Python.</p>
<p>Say you have a project with the following structure:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>.
├── __pypackages__
│   └── 3.8
│       └── lib
└── my_script.py</code></pre></div>
<p>As specified in the PEP 582, if you run <code>python3.8 /path/to/my_script.py</code>, <code>__pypackages__/3.8/lib</code> will be added to <code>sys.path</code>, and the libraries inside will become import-able in <code>my_script.py</code>.</p>
<p>Now let's review the two problems I mentioned in the last section and see how they change with the power of PEP 582. For the first problem, the main cause is that the virtual environment is bound to a cloned Python interpreter on which the subsequent library searching based. It takes advantage of Python's existing mechanisms without any other complex changes but makes the entire virtual environment to become unavailable when the Python interpreter is stale. With the local packages directory, you don't have a Python interpreter any more, the library path is directly appended to <code>sys.path</code>, so you can freely move and copy it.</p>
<p>For the second, once again, you just call the tool against the project you want to analyze, and the <code>__pypackages__</code> sitting inside the project will be loaded automatically. This way you only need to keep one copy of the global tool and make it work with multiple projects.</p>

<p>Starting from the PEP, I made <a href="https://pdm.fming.dev/">PDM</a>, a new Python package manager and workflow tool that leverages PEP 582 to get rid of virtualenv entirely. It installs dependencies into the local package directory <code>__package__</code> and makes Python interpreters aware of it with <a href="https://pdm.fming.dev/#enable-pep-582-globally">a very simple setup</a>. It is not only an implementation of PEP 582 but also the only package manager that supports <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0621/">PEP 621</a>, a new metadata format based on <code>pyproject.toml</code> which becomes the standard recently. It is foreseen that pip will also gradually support this format. Besides, PDM uses the same dependency resolver as pip and has a full-featured plugin system, allowing for community-contributed plugins to enhance the functionalities.</p>
<p>In PDM, PEP 582 is not mandatory, you can also stick with virtualenv. PDM can detect <strong>existing</strong> venvs but not create new ones.</p>
<p>Another thing that is noteworthy is its dependency resolution mechanism -- it tries to lock versions that are compatible with the <code>requires-python</code> value of the project. Say your project requires Python 2.7 or 3.6 upper and you want to add <code>pytest</code> as a development dependency, in Pipenv(ver. <code>2020.11.15</code>) you have to pin <code>pytest = "&lt;5"</code> manually in <code>Pipfile</code>. And in Poetry(ver. <code>1.1.4</code>) if you run <code>poetry add -D pytest</code> you will get:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>The current project's Python requirement <span>(</span><span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>2.7</span>,<span>&lt;</span><span>3.0</span> <span>||</span> <span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>3.6</span>,<span>&lt;</span><span>4.0</span><span>)</span> is not compatible with some of the required packages Python requirement:
    - pytest requires Python <span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>3.6</span>, so it will not be satisfied <span>for</span> Python <span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>2.7</span>,<span>&lt;</span><span>3.0</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Yes, it tells you to upgrade your Python requires version. However, in PDM, you can lock successfully:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>❯ pdm <span>add</span> -d pytest
Adding packages to dev dependencies: pytest
✔ 🔒 Lock successful
Changes are written to pdm.lock.
Changes are written to pyproject.toml.
Synchronizing working <span>set</span> with lock file: <span>11</span> to add, <span>0</span> to update, <span>0</span> to remove

  ✔ Install atomicwrites <span>1.4</span>.0 successful
  ✔ Install colorama <span>0.4</span>.4 successful
  ✔ Install packaging <span>20.8</span> successful
  ✔ Install more-itertools <span>5.0</span>.0 successful

  ✔ Install pytest <span>4.6</span>.11 successful
  ✔ Install six <span>1.15</span>.0 successful
  ✔ Install wcwidth <span>0.2</span>.5 successful

🎉 All complete<span>!</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, <code>pytest</code> is pinned to <code>4.*</code> that is compatible with Python 2.7 and Python 3.6+.</p>
<p>For more features and demos, please refer to the <a href="https://pdm.fming.dev/">PDM's website</a> and <a href="https://github.com/frostming/pdm">GitHub repo</a>.</p>
<h2 id="some-random-words"><a href="#some-random-words" aria-label="some random words permalink"></a>Some random words</h2>
<p>You may have seen this <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">comic</a> before, there are already so many package managers in Python's world, do we need a new one? No, I think. Gladly we have seen many improvements in the Python packaging ecosystem and the official installer pip, such as <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517/">PEP 517</a>/<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/">PEP 518</a>, and the <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/announcement-pip-20-2-release/4863">new dependency resolver</a>, more to come in the future. But before the day comes, why not try something different from the traditional, why not make something new that makes at least myself happy. If you think so, PDM should be an option, hopefully.</p></div></div>]]>

<blockquote>“We have a war between two food systems, a traditional diet of real food and ultra-processed food“</blockquote>
<p><br>…<a href="https://twitter.com/RobertLustigMD/status/909205874098397184">tweeted</a>&nbsp;Dr. Robert Lustig, a fellow Professor at UCSF School of Medicine. He’s right. But I&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/DrSepah/status/909240257270267904">replied</a>&nbsp;with the inconvenient truth few are willing to admit: “processed foods have won the war.” That isn’t to say we should be hopeless about the obesity epidemic, but we must soberingly admit our current strategy for curbing it is doomed. But there is another way. When other strategies fail, clinicians sometimes use “<a href="http://www.uncommon-knowledge.co.uk/articles/uncommon-hypnosis/problems-paradoxes.html">paradoxical interventions</a>” where the problem is prescribed as the cure. So this is a radical manifesto about how processed foods have not only caused the obesity epidemic, but can also cure it. To paraphrase Robert Frost:</p>
<blockquote>“The only way out is through.”</blockquote>
<h2><strong>S.A.D.! The Standard American Diet is 2/3 Processed Foods</strong></h2>
<p>Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, Dean of the Tufts School of Nutrition, and colleagues published one of the most eye-opening <a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/3/e009892">studies</a> on the Standard American Diet (or what I humorously like to call “S.A.D.!”). Astonishingly, they showed that only 1/3 of calories come from ‘unprocessed’ (whole) foods anymore. The other 2/3 of calories come 10% from ‘minimally-processed’ foods (like cheese, which one could potentially make in a kitchen) and a staggering 57% from ‘ultra-processed’ foods (like Cheeze-It crackers, which can only be manufactured in a factory).</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2500/4432/files/SADgraphic_grande.png?v=1510353917" alt=""></p>
<p>The evidence is clear. By a 2:1 margin, processed foods have dominated whole foods in America like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7TjFqCDrDs&amp;lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3B8MFT53a8TtCwx8jXcL1LLw%3D%3D">Mayweather over McGregor</a>. It’s no wonder, processed foods are widely perceived as cheaper, tastier, and more convenient than whole foods. But what people don’t fully realize is that processed foods are actually a dominant technology developed by a multi-trillion dollar food industry, and we are never, ever going back to the pre-industrial way things were. We live in a world of transformative technologies, and in a nation where <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2016/millennials-are-top-smartphone-users.html">98% of Millennials</a> own ‘smart’ phones, our society will clearly never go back to ‘dumb’ phones and pagers. So why do we expect any differently with food?</p>
<h2><strong>What Works for Some, Does Not Work for Most</strong></h2>
<p>For an individual, it is obviously possible to eat 100% whole foods. There are lots of great success stories of people who transformed their entire diets, lost 100 lbs., got off of their medications, etc. But just because “it worked for me”, doesn’t mean it will work for everyone else, because not everyone can “just do what I did.” Any clinician who has actually worked with thousands of patients know that different people have different levels of readiness to change, will require different approaches, and as a result, some will simply do better than others. This is not to downplay the importance of individual responsibility. As I tell my own patients:</p>
<blockquote>“It’s not your fault that you came into my office, but it is your responsibility to walk out better.”</blockquote>
<p><br>Thus, we must balance individual responsibility with acknowledging the data that most don’t succeed on their own. Educating the majority of Americans to only eat whole foods, without addressing how to manage processed foods, is like teaching “abstinence only” sex education, and expecting most people to never engage in sexual activity until marriage. Educational strategies that don’t acknowledge human behavior are hopelessly ineffective. We must acknowledge people indulge, and teach them how to reduce harm when they do so.</p>
<h2><strong>Convenience is King, and is More Sustainable Long-Term.</strong></h2>
<p>The science suggests that though doctors admonish their patients to “eat right and exercise”, this advice alone generally fails to work. In fact, in the placebo/control group (designed to show no effect) of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1351026/">Diabetes Prevention Program clinical trial</a>, patients were counterintuitively instructed to lose 5-10% of their body weight. That’s because researchers knew they <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3135022/figure/F2/">wouldn’t lose any weight</a> anyway! Even the lifestyle (intensive counseling) and metformin (medication) groups, which did lose weight initially and significantly slow the onset of diabetes, eventually regained all the weight lost they lost after a decade.&nbsp;The temporary weight loss was still beneficial (reduced diabetes risk by 34% over 10 years), but would have been more powerful if the weight loss was maintained:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2500/4432/files/metformin_grande.gif?v=1510353972" alt=""></p>
<p>That’s because the law of inertia suggests any clinical treatment for obesity that expects patients to significantly do more work, instead of less, will eventually fail for most people in the long-term. Eating 100% whole foods was only sustainable for a society in a pre-industrial farming era, where the only foods we could eat were the whole foods we hunt, picked, and planted ourselves (that’s the real Omnivore’s Dilemma. Sorry, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/26/magazine/the-modern-huntergatherer.html">Michael Pollan</a>).</p>
<p>But most people no longer have the time, energy, or resources to eat three home-cooked meals per day. Modern households are no longer inter-generational, with fewer grandparents or stay-at-home spouses to bear the responsibility of communal food preparation. Even when TV dinners were introduced in the 1950s, they “<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=vP99yWtfovYC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">came as a great relief</a> for housewives burdened with baby-boom offspring.” Convenience is king. But it’s not just because we don’t have time to prepare whole foods, it’s because processed foods are so behaviorally irresistible.</p>
<h2><strong>Obesity is More of a Behavioral than a Biological Problem.</strong></h2>
<p>In the medical community, obesity is considered a symptom of a larger ‘metabolic syndrome’, which shows up externally, as belly fat, but also internally as high blood sugar, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and high blood fats. But these are actually symptoms of the root problem. While obesity is a complex, biopsychosocial issue with no easy explanation, the explosion in obesity rates suggest there’s something radical going on. &nbsp;If you look at this CDC time lapse of obesity rates from 1985-2010, most states went from &lt;10% obesity to &gt;30% obesity in the span of only 25 years!</p>
<p><iframe width="744" height="419" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ihSeSToXOw" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>So what’s going on? The main driver is that the way we eat has changed dramatically: with people cooking less, eating out more, and relying more on processed, carbohydrate-rich foods that drive insulin resistance. Thus, this data suggests that obesity is more of a behavioral problem than a biological problem. These foods also serve a psychological need. Despite the current opioid crisis, eating is actually America’s favorite narcotic: with <a href="http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2013/eating.aspx">38% of adults</a> reporting “they have overeaten or eaten unhealthy foods in the past month because of stress.”</p>
<h2><strong>Most Ultra-Processed Foods Are ‘Designer Drugs’. We’re Hooked.</strong></h2>
<p>Americans are victims of an ‘obesogenic’ environment that has them hopelessly hooked to the most irresistible designer drug the world has ever known: ultra-processed foods. In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Waistland-evolutionary-Weight-Fitness-Crisis-ebook/dp/B000W7KNDK/ref=pd_sim_351_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=0KHF98P7DGDENXB3A6CS">Waistland: A (R)evolutionary View of Our Weight and Fitness Crisis</a>, psychologist Deirdre Barrett argues out that human beings evolved to crave certain stimuli: fats, salts, and sweets, to help us survive and thrive through harsh times. “Big Food” companies exploited these natural cravings by designing processed foods that are far fattier, sweeter, and saltier than anything that normally exists in nature. Thus, processed foods are “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0034N7JI6/">supernormal stimuli</a>” purposefully designed to be addictive, and effectively outcompete whole foods on our tricked taste buds.</p>
<p>Lest you think this is a conspiracy theory — Big Food industry scientists have admitted they use such principles to create addictive foods. A New York Times article, “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/magazine/the-extraordinary-science-of-junk-food.html">The Extraordinary Science of Addictive Junk Food</a>”, revealed that companies like Frito-Lay use $30 million R&amp;D budgets to hire research staffs of 500+ scientists to create ‘frankenfoods’ like Cheetos. Cheetos include technologies like “vanishing caloric density,” which make them melt in your mouth so quickly “your brain thinks that there’s no calories in it . . . you can just keep eating it forever.” In light of such irresistible foods, why do we actually expect people to exercise self-control and just “<a href="https://vimeo.com/97370236">stop it</a>”?</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2500/4432/files/cheetos_large.jpg?v=1510354062" alt=""></p>
<h3><strong></strong></h3>
<h2><strong>All Drugs Aren’t Bad. All Processed Foods Aren’t Either.</strong></h2>
<p>In the modern era, we treat addiction as a disease, and often replace addictive and impure street drugs like heroin, with prescription opioid medications like methadone that are purified and better controlled to prevent deadly withdrawals and carefully wean people off. Street drugs and prescription drugs are both “drugs”, but can hardly be equated since the former often takes lives, while the latter can often give it back if properly prescribed and used.</p>
<p>Similarly, we can’t lump all processed foods together as being “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uh7l8dx-h8M">bad, m’kay</a>?” Minimally-processed foods like yogurt, butter, and cheese, have been made at home for millennia and also ultra-processed in factories more recently. Studies show dairy consumption is associated with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28318689">lower risk</a> of type 2 diabetes. The devil is always in the details though, and a ball of handmade mozzarella cheese is hardly the same thing as processed cheese slices that have so little actual cheese in them the FDA requires legally labeling them as “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processed_cheese#Legal_definitions">cheese product</a>.”</p>
<h2><strong>Intentions Matter: Processing for Health vs. Wealth.</strong></h2>
<p>So we should just avoid ultra-processed foods by avoiding all those chemical sounding ingredients we can’t pronounce, right? While this ‘chemophobia’ can be a helpful shortcut, it’s also not always accurate. If you analyze any whole food like a Kiwi, it’s technically made up of a lot of ‘chemicals’ that naturally exist in nature:</p>
<p>Just because a food is ultra-processed or fortified with added ingredients doesn’t inherently make it unhealthy. While the <a href="http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/exclusive_breastfeeding/en/">World Health Organization</a> educates mothers that breastfeeding for the first 6 months is the “optimal way of feeding infants”, it also acknowledges that infant formula can play an essential or supplementary role in keeping infants alive and healthy when mothers cannot breastfeed regularly. Thus, some ultra-processed foods are optimized for health more than cost or taste, due to tighter government regulations and more selectivity by consumers.</p>

it is secure."><div><p>We explain how CryFS works and why it is secure.</p><p>The description can be a bit technical in some points. If you're rather interested in using CryFS, take a look at the <a>CryFS Tutorial</a>.</p></div></section><section><div><h2>Storing data</h2><div><p><img src="https://www.cryfs.org/_next/static/images/storingdata-6e5ee2b5bc550e4d8be92cbcd80b9011.png" alt="Your files, metadata and directory structure are stored as a set of same-size blocks, encrypted, and stored in the cloud."></p><div><p>The goal of CryFS is not only to keep file contents, but also file sizes, metadata and directory structure confidential.</p><p>To hide file sizes, CryFS splits the content of a file into same-size blocks and encrypts these blocks individually.
A tree structure is used to remember how the blocks belong together to form a file.
This tree structure has very little overhead and itself is also stored using encrypted same-size blocks.
To hide file metadata and directory structure, they are also represented using encrypted same-size blocks.</p><p>Each encrypted block is stored as a file in the base directory, using a random ID as filename.
The base directory can then be set up to be synchronized with a cloud provider like Dropbox.
An attacker with access to the base directory can only see a set of same-size ciphertext blocks and can't see
contents, file sizes, metadata or directory structure of your data.</p><p>The blocks are encrypted using a block cipher chosen by the user. A random encryption key is generated when the filesystem is created.
This key is stored in a configuration file, which is then encrypted using the password chosen by the user.
Since it is encrypted, it can be stored together with the ciphertext blocks in the cloud, which is the default.
If you want to use an insecure (e.g. empty) password or don't trust the scrypt algorithm used for encrypting the configuration file, you can also keep the configuration file locally.</p></div></div></div></section><section><div><h2>Configuration File</h2><p>The base directory also contains a configuration file with the information CryFS needs to decrypt it.
This configuration file is encrypted and integrity-checked using the password chosen by the user, so an attacker cannot read or modify it.</p><p>The information stored in the configuration file includes the following.</p><ul><li><strong>[Cipher]</strong>: The cipher used (e.g. <var>aes-256-gcm</var>)</li><li><strong>[Encryption Key]</strong>: The encryption key used for encrypting blocks</li><li><strong>[Root Block ID]</strong>: The block ID for the block storing the root directory (entry point for the filesystem)</li></ul><div><div><p>The configuration file is encrypted twice, once with <var>aes-256-gcm</var> and once with the cipher chosen by the user.
This way, if the user doesn't trust <var>aes-256-gcm</var> for some reason,
they can choose another cipher and still be secure.
The keys for both encryption layers are generated from the user-chosen password using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt">scrypt</a>.</p><p>In detail, CryFS generates two keys <var>outer_key</var> and <var>inner_key</var> using scrypt and the user password.
It encrypts the configuration file using the user cipher and <var>inner_key</var>.
To the ciphertext, it prepends the name of the user cipher (so it knows how to decrypt it later) and encrypts
the result using <var>aes-256-gcm</var> and <var>outer_key</var>. This way, an attacker cannot see or manipulate which cipher is used.
As a last step, the scrypt configuration parameters are prepended, so CryFS knows how to configure scrypt when
decrypting the filesystem.
When decrypting the configuration file, CryFS first reads the scrypt parameters and regenerates both keys from the user password.
Then, it decrypts the first layer and reads the cipher chosen by the user.
Using this cipher, it decrypts the second layer and reads the configuration values.</p></div><p><img src="https://www.cryfs.org/_next/static/images/configfileencryption-3ae7bd61acfdd365aab16b721dbbcfad.png" alt="Configuration File Encryption Layers"></p></div><p>The integrity of the configuration file depends on <var>aes-256-gcm</var>.
This cipher is a standard cipher and believed to be very secure.
If, however, you don't trust the integrity of <var>aes-256-gcm</var> and want to use another cipher instead,
we recommend adding the <kbd>--cipher xxx</kbd> parameter each time you mount the filesystem.
This way, CryFS can check that the cipher used by the filesystem is the one you actually specified
and you don't have to rely on the <var>aes-256-gcm</var> integrity verification step.</p><p>Alternatively, you can store the configuration file outside of the base directory and not upload it into the cloud.<br>
This is possible using the <kbd>--config</kbd> parameter when calling CryFS.</p></div></section><section><div><h2>Security Analysis</h2><p>The security of CryFS has been proven in a <a href="https://www.cryfs.org/cryfs_mathesis.pdf">master's thesis</a>
and in a <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-61176-1_23">scientific paper published at DBSec 2017</a>

The works also contain a detailed description of the inner workings of CryFS.</p><p>The current version meets all security goals regarding confidentiality of file contents, size, metadata and directory structure.
The integrity goals mentioned in the thesis are also implemented as of version 0.10.0.
The 0.9.x versions protect the encrypted blocks from being modified by an attacker,
since they use an authenticated encryption scheme like <var>aes-256-gcm</var>,
but they don't prevent an attacker from rolling back the filesystem by replacing blocks with an earlier valid version of the same block yet.</p></div></section><section></section> <section></section></div></div>]]>

As it's the NAT or firewall that opens the destination port, this bypasses any browser-based port restrictions.</p><p>This attack takes advantage of arbitrary control of the data portion of some TCP and UDP packets <i>without</i> including HTTP or other headers; the attack performs this new packet injection technique across all major modern (and older) browsers, and is a modernized version to my original <a target="_blank" href="https://samy.pl/natpin/">NAT Pinning technique from 2010</a> (presented at DEFCON 18 + Black Hat 2010). Additionally, new techniques for local IP address discovery are included.</p><p>This attack requires the NAT/firewall to support ALG (Application Level Gateways), which are mandatory for protocols that can use multiple ports (control channel + data channel) such as SIP and H323 (VoIP protocols), FTP, IRC DCC, etc.</p><div>

<li>some browsers (Chrome) only divulge the local IP via WebRTC over HTTPS but some of our attacks require HTTP so we first redirect to the HTTPS version of the attack software to extract the local IP</li>
<li>we then redirect to the HTTP version with the local IP included in the URL if we were able to obtain it to bypass other cross-origin protection mechanisms (the <code>.local</code> mDNS/Bonjour address presented will not be useful for the attack)</li>

</ul></li>
<li>large UDP beacon sent from browser via WebRTC TURN authentication mechanism to non-standard port to attacker's server to force IP fragmentation with TURN <code>username</code> field stuffed

<li>victim NAT sees proper SIP REGISTER packet on SIP port or proper H.323 call forward packet (with no HTTP data), triggering ALG to open any TCP/UDP port defined in packet back to any victim host on the network
<ul>
<li>victim NAT rewrites SIP or H.323 packet, replacing internal IP with public IP, hinting to attacker exploit was successful</li>
<li>(v2) as H.323 call forwarding can direct to any other IP, packet can contain any internal IP of any other host on the victim's network, triggering the NAT to port forward to any system on the network</li>
<li>even if victim NAT normally rewrites source ports, the ALG will still be forced to port forward to the attacker's port of choice as it believes victim machine (or other machine on the network, entirely determined by attacker) opened that port and attacker sees new source port in arriving SIP/H.323 packet </li>
<li><b>attacker can now bypass victim NAT and connect directly back to any port on any machine on the network, exposing previously protected/hidden services and systems</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li><i>to investigate...perhaps by you?</i>
<ul>
  <li>non-malicious usage: this technique essentially gives browsers full TCP and UDP socket capability to communicate to any protocol locally on the system; the connection can be abstracted through a cloud server that connects back but the browser just talks to the cloud server as if it's the socket and makes browsers much more powerful to communicate on non-web-friendly protocols</li>
  <li>if testing in a virtual machine (VM) using shared networking (used to protect a host from attacks by routing it through the host, not letting it directly onto the network), if the packets make it out, the parent host machine is where the ports end up getting opened, not the VM ;)</li>
  <li>IP fragmentation allows full control of all data in the IP data section, meaning full control of the <b>UDP header</b>, including source/dest ports in the overflowed packet...what else could this abuse?</li>
</ul></li>

<h2 id="network-address-translation-nat">Network Address Translation (NAT)</h2>

<p>We use NATs (Network Address Translation) for several reasons. The most useful feature of NAT is that it allows a single public IP address to be shared among multiple systems. It does this by creating a local network, providing local IP addresses to all machines that connect, and when one of those systems reaches out to the Internet, it rewrites packets going out to use the public IP so responses come back to the NAT, and vice versa, rewriting destination IP to specific client's IP. </p>

<p>It's the responsibility of the NAT to differentiate connections to the same addresses/ports (google.com:443) from internal hosts as ultimately their outbound port, destination ip and source ip will all be the same. If two different internal peers attempt to connect from the same source port, modern NATs will alter one of the source ports (some networks do this to all TCP/UDP source ports).</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samyk/slipstream/main/img/lan.png" alt="NAT"></p>

<h3 id="connection-tracking">Connection Tracking</h3>

<p>From <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Netfilter">Wikipedia à la Wikiwand</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code>One of the important features built on top of the Netfilter 
framework is connection tracking. Connection tracking 
allows the kernel to keep track of all logical network 
connections or sessions, and thereby relate all of the packets
which may make up that connection. NAT relies on this 
information to translate all related packets in the same way, 
and iptables can use this information to act as a stateful 
firewall.</code></pre></div>

<p>If a machine behind your NAT sends a packet out and your router expects the remote host may respond, it keeps track of information, specifically the source and destination ports, source and destination IP addresses, and your internal IP, then returns any packets matching it back to your internal IP.</p>

<p>If another host on your LAN attempts to make the same connection with the same source and destination ports + IPs, your NAT wouldn't be able to discriminate it (the source IPs are different on your LAN but are rewritten to the same public IP on the WAN side), so it alters the source port, but rewrites it when sending back to you.</p>

<h3 id="application-level-gateway">Application Level Gateway</h3>

<p>ALGs allow NAT to track a multi-port protocol like FTP to go out from your system to an FTP server, then track when you request a file to be sent to your internal IP on a specific port, the ALG can rewrite the packet to include your public IP, then forward the FTP's server connection back to you. Had it not rewritten your IP, the FTP server would try to connect back to you on your internal IP (or not try at all if it expects the source IP to be the same as the signaling connection).</p>

<div>
<h3>Release Date:</h3><p>
January 26, 2021
</p><h3>Summary:</h3><p>
A serious heap-based buffer overflow has been discovered in sudo
that is exploitable by any local user. It has been given the name
<em>Baron Samedit</em> by its discoverer. The bug can be leveraged
to elevate privileges to root, even if the user is not listed in
the sudoers file. User authentication is not required to exploit
the bug.
</p><h3>Sudo versions affected:</h3><p>
Sudo versions 1.8.2 through 1.8.31p2 and 1.9.0 through 1.9.5p1 are
affected.
</p><h3>CVE ID:</h3><p>
This vulnerability has been assigned <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3156" onclick="getOutboundLink('http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3156');">CVE-2021-3156</a>
in the <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/" onclick="getOutboundLink('http://cve.mitre.org/');">Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures</a> database.
</p><h3>Details:</h3><p>
When sudo runs a command in <em>shell</em> mode, either via the
<strong>-s</strong> or <strong>-i</strong> command line option, it
escapes special characters in the command's arguments with a backslash.
The sudoers policy plugin will then remove the escape characters from
the arguments before evaluating the sudoers policy (which doesn't
expect the escape characters) if the command is being run in shell
mode.
</p><p>
A bug in the code that removes the escape characters will read
beyond the last character of a string if it ends with an unescaped
backslash character. Under normal circumstances, this bug would
be harmless since sudo has escaped all the backslashes in the
command's arguments. However, due to a different bug, this time
in the command line parsing code, it is possible to run <tt>sudoedit</tt>
with either the <strong>-s</strong> or <strong>-i</strong> options,
setting a flag that indicates shell mode is enabled. Because a
command is not actually being run, sudo does <strong>not</strong>
escape special characters. Finally, the code that decides whether
to remove the escape characters did not check whether a command is
actually being run, just that the shell flag is set. This inconsistency
is what makes the bug exploitable.
</p><p>
To test whether your version of sudo is vulnerable, the following
command can be used:
</p><pre>sudoedit -s '\' `perl -e 'print "A" x 65536'`
</pre><p>
If you receive a usage or error message, sudo is not vulnerable.
If the result is a <strong>Segmentation fault</strong>, sudo is
vulnerable.
</p><p>

</p><h3>Impact:</h3><p>
A local user may be able to exploit sudo to elevate privileges to
root as long as the sudoers file (usually /etc/sudoers) is present.
</p><h3>Workaround:</h3><p>
None. Sudo version 1.9.5p2 or a patched vendor-supported version
must be installed.
</p><h3>Fix:</h3><p>
The bug is fixed in sudo 1.9.5p2.
</p><h3>Credit:</h3><p>
Thanks to the Qualys Security Advisory team for their detailed bug
report and explanation of its implications.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>Fear and panic could destroy the city as much as plague itself. Many of the doctors fled, along with the rich and powerful; quacks preyed on the poor with their neverfail miracle drugs. Neighbours informed against each other. People lied to each other – and to themselves. Worse – there were stories of infected people deliberately concealing their telltale ‘tokens’ and going out into the streets trying to infect others.</p><p>-Daniel Defoe, <em>A Journal of the Plague Year</em> (1722)</p></blockquote><h5>Zeynep Tüfekçi is a force of nature whose intellectual range encompasses everything from academic sociology to the impact of social media on society to (more recently) the COVID mask and lockdown debates. Her book <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3hibL21">Twitter and Tear Gas</a></em> is a now-classic study of Internet-fueled protest, and she continues to write prolifically for <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/zeynep-tufekci">The New York Times</a> </em> and <em><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/zeynep-tufekci/">The Atlantic</a>. </em>In our lengthy interview—I completely ignored Substack warnings about email length—I unveil the jocular coinage ‘zeynepping’ to describe this unique blend of contrarian and wide-ranging embroilment in the burning issues of the day. She and I have had a year-long DM thread where we agree on basically nothing, except perhaps that McLuhan was right about the fundamentally oral dynamics of modern digital media (which we only mention in passing here, because of course we spent most of our time bickering). She agreed to publicize some of our disagreement in the longest <em>Pull Request</em> interview yet. Tüfekçi also recently started <a href="https://zeynep.substack.com/">her own Substack </a><em><a href="https://zeynep.substack.com/">Insight</a></em>.</h5><p><strong>From what you’ve told me, you started your career as a programmer but then you ended up doing a master's degree and PhD. But your claim to fame was the book on Twitter and the Middle East and its various convulsions, is that right?</strong></p><p>My first claim to fame was when Facebook started. It was just seen as a little college thing, and I started writing that it would scramble our understanding of privacy. It was just collapsing a lot of geographic boundaries, and since I was a college teacher, I could see it in the students’ experience; their mental model of what Facebook was and what it actually did to their experience of space and time. I remember one incident: I used to teach intro to sociology and it's a big lecture class, because that's how those things work. So I would assign little group assignments to break up the lecture. What if you were born a different gender? Or what if you were in a different family? Just very simple, simple stuff for students. And they got a passing grade so long as they turned in something. </p><p>So my TA at one point notices that a bunch of them have the same handwriting. Why on earth are they cheating, what is going on? So I called the group into my office, and they say: <em>What a coincidence we all have the same handwriting!</em> And I ask: <em>Do you know each other?</em> <em>No, we don't know each other</em>, they say. And I did something that I don't ever do: I looked them up on Facebook. And of course, they were all friends with each other, so I just showed them Facebook and I said: <em>Look, you're lying to me, you're all friends with each other</em>. They almost fainted in my office because the idea that their friendship could be documented and be visible to the outside world and that Facebook would be a vehicle for this was a completely alien and incomprehensible thing to these kids.</p><p>The most interesting thing to me was how could they not imagine the obvious thing that this is going to scramble their visibility and ruin their denial. They just had no idea. So I started doing some studies…</p><p><strong>What year was this?</strong></p><p>This was before the Arab Spring, I think my first studies where 2007 or 2008-ish?</p><p>I started saying stuff like: <em>Facebook, they're going to scramble privacy, they are changing how we understand primary and secondary social contacts and their visibility</em>. I started arguing that in some ways—and this is something you and I talk about a lot—this is taking people back to a more intrinsically human way of living, in which you don't lose contact with people. This idea that you've graduated from middle school, and then high school, and then go to a different city and never see those people again, that's kind of a weird 20th-century blip: that's not how humans have mostly lived. But at a scale that is not the same as your village or hunter-gatherer experience. It's got a little bit of this, a little bit of that, and it's going to scramble everything. I kept saying this is going to change the fabric of society, these tools are not these things that just sit outside of society. </p><p>And when the Arab Spring hit, then all of a sudden, because I’m from the Middle East, all of a sudden, people were like: <em>Oh, wait, there was somebody talking about this</em>, and everybody wanted an explanation. That’s when I started being able to do my current work as until then universities would hire me because I could do stats and math. The rest has been a blur.</p><p><strong>I recall first reading your work in the wake of the Arab Spring. The Western vibe at the time was definitely: </strong><em><strong>Isn't this just great and amazing?</strong></em><strong> </strong><em><strong>Twitter is central to this entire social turmoil</strong></em><strong>! Though in retrospect, it might not have had the centrality that Westerners imagined, in terms of the bigger picture…</strong></p><p>But it actually was really important. What's really funny is that a lot of these people are also my friends and people I had known because of the Middle Eastern democracy and dissident crowds. They got so sick of Western journalists asking them about Twitter and Facebook every day, they would just lie, and say: <em>It had nothing to do with any saying. Stop this bullshit. You know, we don't really use those tools</em>.</p><p>They would literally say that, and then they would be on the backchannel saying:<em> Wait, I think the Twitter trending algorithm changed,</em> because they were disassembling it, and they thought about it a lot. But they got so sick of the navel gazing about it because the West could only relate to them as Twitter users. So I wouldn't say it didn't play a key role: I think it played a major role in the upheaval. But it got framed in the West as a stupid question. You know, <em>was it Twitter or was it the people?</em> I felt like stabbing my eyes out when people ask those kinds of questions, so that's when I start writing about it.</p><h4>We have the same narrative about social media in the West now: When it's destabilizing to the people that the chattering classes don't like, it's great. And when it's destabilizing to the chattering classes, then it's terrible: we don't do <em>that</em> to <em>them.</em></h4><p><strong>Right. So the two claims are: This Twitter/Facebook thing is absolutely central. Again, the only way we can relate to these people is via their Twitter usage, otherwise, the local politics are not of vital interest from the Western perspective. And then secondly, that this was all a magnificent thing.</strong></p><p><strong>But as soon as those same disruptions visit the West in the form of Trump, Brexit, the </strong><em><strong>gilets jaunes</strong></em><strong>, etc. Suddenly: </strong><em><strong>Have we questioned whether overthrowing the state of affairs is actually such a great thing??</strong></em><strong> It's interesting to see the contrast between that sort of narrative and the one in 2016.</strong></p><p>We have the same narrative about social media in the West now: When it's destabilizing the people that the chattering classes don't like, it's great. And when it's destabilizing the chattering classes, then it's terrible: we don't do <em>that</em> to <em>them.</em></p><p>When Obama won in 2012, there were I don't know how many articles talking about how great his use of technology and data was. Which is why I started saying: <em>wait, wait, it's not about your candidate, this might not be that great, and there are all these problems</em>. Interestingly, when I started saying that—<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/opinion/beware-the-big-data-campaign.html">I wrote that </a><em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/opinion/beware-the-big-data-campaign.html">Times </a></em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/opinion/beware-the-big-data-campaign.html">op-ed</a>, which caused so much grief for me—I heard from so many tech people, from Obama people and big data people and Silicon Valley people, who told me that these tools were necessarily going to only be used by smart people, which were of course them, right? I mean, the whole tech world was completely convinced that the other side, so to speak, would never be smart like them. Really high level people in both the Obama administration and in Silicon Valley just thought: <em>you know, this is ours, this will always be ours, and it will always do our bidding.</em> And of course, anybody who knows history is jumping up and down saying <em>it doesn't do your bidding like that!</em> It's not your little pony that's gonna just destabilize things you happen to dislike at the moment and leave you alone. So here we are.</p><h4>I heard from so many tech people, from Obama people and big data people and Silicon Valley people, who told me that these tools were necessarily going to only be used by smart people, which were of course them, right?

Really high level people in both the Obama administration and in Silicon Valley just thought: <em>you know, this is ours, this will always be ours, and it will always do our bidding.</em></h4><p><strong>You and I both have the same hang ups, because we've had these conversations before, such as the conflict between literacy and orality, the weird warping of geography that social media causes, which to me is one of the biggest things I can't get my head around. </strong></p><p><strong>But just before we leave the topic of the Middle East: One thing <a href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/the-prophet-of-the-revolt">I asked Martin Gurri about</a> is how is it that a lot of these movements, unlike previous revolutionary movements, didn't quite congeal into any sort of lasting institutional change. The classic example is Occupy Wall Street and to a lesser extent the </strong><em><strong>Gilets Jaunes</strong></em><strong> which haven't really done anything in the political space. Arguably the only counter example is Spain with Podemos…</strong></p><p>In Spain, the group just broke off. They just said, we're gonna form a political party. And that's it. </p><p>If you skimmed my book, my theory there is that these movements look like past movements, in that they have these big massive street marches. But you're looking at something different, right? So if you look at a past big march, …</p></div></div>

                    <p>250+ Developers, SREs, DevOps, Architects and Product Managers have spoken: they struggle with releasing microservices into production. It remains a costly, manual, error-prone and nail-biting task for software teams. In our report we dive into challenges, trends and opportunities for improvement when it comes to releasing and validating software in production. </p><p>The survey spotlights the stark challenges SMBs and enterprises are facing as they pursue their cloud, Kubernetes and microservices journey. The need for release automation increases as systems become more complex (dependencies, highly distributed, different release frequencies) and the pressure from the business to release software faster (and more frequently) is higher than ever.</p><h3 id="kubernetes-and-microservices-have-become-mainstream">Kubernetes and Microservices Have Become Mainstream</h3><p>72% of participants say that they are using Kubernetes in production today and 16% says that they are evaluating or planning to use Kubernetes. Microservices are even more popular. 81% of participants say that they are using microservices in production today and 14% says they have plans to use microservices.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-26-at-17.01.14.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-26-at-17.01.14.png 600w, https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-26-at-17.01.14.png 1000w, https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-26-at-17.01.14.png 1001w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://vamp.io/state-of-cloud-native-release-orchestration-2021"><strong>Download the full report State of Cloud-Native Release Orchestration here.</strong></a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="majority-is-still-using-high-risk-release-strategies">Majority Is Still Using High-Risk Release Strategies</h3><p>Releasing in production is the process of taking running code and making it “live” and accessible to users, in a predictable and repeatable way. It's about paying particular attention to ensure that releasing a new version doesn’t result in a worse experience for your users. 86% of participants are still using high-risk release strategies such as rolling update, blue-green and big-bang releases. There is a strong lack of canary releasing capabilities with only 9% of participants using this low-risk release strategy. Canary releasing limits the number of users exposed to a bad release (known as limiting the blast radius) by gradually rolling out a new version of a service to a small, representative subgroup of <em><em>real</em></em> user traffic before rolling it out to the entire user base.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/2021/01/release-strategy-image.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/release-strategy-image.png 600w, https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/2021/01/release-strategy-image.png 723w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="release-validation-and-rollbacks-remain-a-manual-time-consuming-task">Release Validation and Rollbacks Remain A Manual, Time-Consuming Task</h3><p>Release validation is the process of making sure that released software that’s running in production is meeting the requirements in terms of performance, quality, customer experience and business KPIs. On average it takes 2.2 hours with 4 people engaged during the release validation process.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/2021/01/image-blog.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-blog.png 600w, https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/2021/01/image-blog.png 723w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Rollbacks are a critical part of your release strategy. When implemented right, it creates a safety net to protect your software teams and minimize the impact on the customer experience when issues are starting to occur. 53% of rollbacks are done manually with an average time to rollback of 45 minutes.</p><h3 id="dependency-management-is-the-biggest-challenge-when-it-comes-to-releasing-microservices">Dependency Management Is The Biggest Challenge When It Comes To Releasing Microservices</h3><p>The report revealed that dependency management is the biggest challenge when it comes to releasing microservices in production. Twenty percent of respondents struggle with dependency management, 14% struggle with internal processes and communication, and 10% find validating changing and testing microservices a challenge.</p><h3 id="the-state-of-cloud-native-release-orchestration-2021">The State of Cloud-Native Release Orchestration 2021</h3><p>This blog only scratches the surface of The State of Cloud-Native Release Orchestration, which dives into further topics including release metrics, business drivers to go Cloud-Native, most used monitoring tools and where companies are focussing on when it comes to improvements across the software delivery process in 2021. <a href="https://vamp.io/state-of-cloud-native-release-orchestration-2021">Download the full research report for free</a> and share with interested colleagues.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/2021/01/Group-70-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Group-70-1.png 600w, https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Group-70-1.png 1000w, https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/2021/01/Group-70-1.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://vamp.io/state-of-cloud-native-release-orchestration-2021"><strong>Download the full research report for free here.</strong></a></figcaption></figure>

		<p>It should come as no surprise that we here at Plex are media lovers. Consummate curators of all that streamy goodness. Voracious imbibers at the fount of all content. Okay, gross, but you get the point. Anyway, every so often an armchair Reddit philosopher comes forth to question some basic truths: “What exactly is the nature of ‘Media’?” they ask. And “How can Plex help us media lovers more fully consummate our curationship?” Okay, sorry, gross again. But it’s a fair question, and one that deserves a little more attention.</p>
<p>Not to date ourselves, but quite a few of us are products of the ‘80s and ‘90s. And when we think about the media that shaped our childhoods and young adult lives, there was one thing that defined us and made it clear that even though we were weird, at the very least we weren’t weird alone. That’s right: <em>stamp collections!</em></p>
<p>Oh wait. We meant VIDEO GAMES.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SYepu_5oSOc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3>In the beginning…</h3>
<p>The genesis of Plex saw us casting a disdainful eye over shelves of CDs, DVDs, and random files strewn over hard drives; we knew there had to be a better way to centrally organize and curate our media collections. A safe haven free from scratches and <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bewaring-of-the-green/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">green markers</a>. A place where we could Marie Kondo until every last poster and background was perfect, and then explore and play from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>But there was one category left on that media shelf, gathering dust. It was the old plastic cartridges for our beloved gaming consoles of yore. After all, in the years since our youth, fellow curators have managed to amass rich archives of gorgeous metadata for games, and the retro gaming community truly does run deep. It’s a fantastic movement, and after some soul searching and spiritual walkabouts, the answer arrived: this media belongs inside Plex!</p>
<p>We’ve actually kicked the idea around for years, and given that over the last year we’ve been looking for new ways to entertain and distract ourselves, we decided to finally make it happen. And we gotta say, the results are super cool! It’s so fun to see a collection of ROMs rendered as a Plex library with all the power of filtering, searching, and beautiful details pages, but of course that’s only half the picture…</p>

<h3>Let there be light!</h3>
<p>Video and audio streaming have always been our specialty. We’re blessed with some amazing engineers (among the best in the world!) working on this, and in general we’ve been laser focused on making that experience better.</p>
<p>However, over time we’ve seen some truly impressive developments in interactive game streaming tech. Please allow us to introduce our new partner <a href="https://parsec.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parsec</a>: With their underlying low-latency streaming technology, it was suddenly possible to offer <em>fully playable</em> game libraries within Plex.</p>
<h3>Let the library teem with games</h3>




<p>We’ve also partnered with the most hallowed name in retro games: Atari. With them on board as a partner we’re able to fully license a catalog of classic titles right out of the box. We’re talking Centipede. We’re talking Lunar Lander. We’re talking Motor Psycho!</p>

<p>On account of these partnerships and the licensing involved, Plex Arcade will be a separate subscription for <span data-pp-price-feature="arcade"></span> per month if you have a Plex Pass (and <span data-pp-price-feature="arcade"></span> per month if you haven’t made the leap to Plex Pass yet). Don’t know if you’ll like it? <a href="https://www.plex.tv/arcade/checkout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Try it free for 7 days</strong></a> (that’s a whole week among friends), no strings attached, and let us know what you think.</p>
<h3>Be fruitful</h3>
<p>Look. This effort is real, but if we’re honest it was conceived by a few passionate Plex Labs rats over scorpion bowls at <a href="https://www.mamasfishhouse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mama’s</a>. For now, we’ve convinced the powers-that-be to let us run with it, but we know it’s far from done and we see it as a kind of internal Kickstarter-type project.

<p>There are a few limitations you should be aware of: For now, the server only works on Windows and macOS (sorry, Parsec doesn’t offer their libraries on Linux or other platforms currently, meaning it is not available for servers running on Linux, NAS devices, or NVIDIA SHIELD); and gameplay is restricted to Android (mobile and TV), iOS, tvOS, and the Chrome web browser.</p>
<p>To get started, grab the latest Plex Media Server, and create a new Games library, just like you would for any of your existing media types. We’re working on relaxing these limitations, but for now they’re real.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><a href="https://samy.pl/slipstream/">NAT Slipstreaming</a> allows an attacker to remotely access any TCP/UDP service bound to <b>any system</b> behind a victim's NAT, bypassing the victim's NAT/firewall (remote arbitrary firewall pinhole control), just by the victim visiting a website.</p><p><em>animation generated with my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/samyk/drawio">fork</a> of <a target="_blank" href="https://draw.io/">draw.io</a>, allowing exportable edge context flow &amp; control in animations</em></p><p>NAT Slipstreaming exploits the user's browser in conjunction with the Application Level Gateway (ALG) connection tracking mechanism built into NATs, routers, and firewalls by chaining internal IP extraction via timing attack or WebRTC, automated remote MTU and IP fragmentation discovery, TCP packet size massaging, TURN authentication misuse, precise packet boundary control, and protocol confusion through browser abuse. As it's the NAT or firewall that opens the destination port, this bypasses any browser-based port restrictions.</p><p>This attack takes advantage of arbitrary control of the data portion of some TCP and UDP packets <i>without</i> including HTTP or other headers; the attack performs this new packet injection technique across all major modern (and older) browsers, and is a modernized version to my original <a target="_blank" href="https://samy.pl/natpin/">NAT Pinning technique from 2010</a> (presented at DEFCON 18 + Black Hat 2010). Additionally, new techniques for local IP address discovery are included.</p><p>This attack requires the NAT/firewall to support ALG (Application Level Gateways), which are mandatory for protocols that can use multiple ports (control channel + data channel) such as SIP and H323 (VoIP protocols), FTP, IRC DCC, etc.</p><div>
  <li>victim visits malicious site (or site with malicious advertisement)<!-- eg <a target=_blank href="https://samy.pl/slipstream/server">https://samy.pl/slipstream/server</a>--></li>
<li>internal IP of victim first must be extracted by browser and sent to server

<ul>
<li>internal IP attempted to be extracted via <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/">WebRTC</a> data channel over https</li>
<ul>
<li>some browsers (Chrome) only divulge the local IP via WebRTC over HTTPS but some of our attacks require HTTP so we first redirect to the HTTPS version of the attack software to extract the local IP</li>
<li>we then redirect to the HTTP version with the local IP included in the URL if we were able to obtain it to bypass other cross-origin protection mechanisms (the <code>.local</code> mDNS/Bonjour address presented will not be useful for the attack)</li>
</ul>
<li>if internal IP not divulged by WebRTC (Safari) or no WebRTC (&lt;= IE11), <strong>web-based TCP timing attack performed</strong>

<ul>
<li>hidden <code>img</code> tags to all common gateways (eg <code>192.168.0.1</code>) are loaded in background</li>
<li><code>onerror/onsuccess</code> events attached to <code>img</code> tags</li>
<li>if any TCP RST (onerror) returned by gateway, or SYN + HTTP response (onsuccess), within a few seconds (before TCP timeout triggers onerror), we've detected valid subnet</li>
<li>re-perform timing attack across all IPs on detected subnets (/24), measuring time to onerror/onsuccess firing</li>
<li>fastest response is likely internal IP, though all responses are considered victim internal IP candidates and attacked</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>large TCP beacon sent via hidden form and automatic HTTP POST to attacker "HTTP server" bound to a non-standard port to force TCP segmentation and maximum MTU size discovery of the victim's IP stack
<ul>
<li>attacker TCP server sends <a target="_blank" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793#section-3.1">Maximum Segment Size</a> TCP Option to massage victim outbound packet sizes (<a target="_blank" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793#section-3.1">RFC 793 x3.1</a>), allowing control of how large browser TCP packets will be</li>
</ul></li>
<li>large UDP beacon sent from browser via WebRTC TURN authentication mechanism to non-standard port to attacker's server to force IP fragmentation with TURN <code>username</code> field stuffed
<ul>
<li>we perform a similar attack as our TCP segmentation, but over UDP as IP fragmentation will occur and provide different values than TCP segmentation</li>
<li>victim MTU size, IP header size, IP packet size, TCP header size, TCP segment sizes detected by server and sent back to victim's browser, used later for packet stuffing</li>
</ul></li>
<li>(v1) "SIP packet" in new hidden form generated, containing internal IP to trigger Application Level Gateway connection tracking
<ul>
<li>"HTTP POST" to server on TCP port 5060 (SIP port) initiated, avoiding <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/samyk/chromium/blob/2d57e5b8afc6d01b344a8d95d3470d46b35845c5/net/base/port_util.cc#L20-L90">restricted browser ports</a></li>
<li>POST data is "stuffed" to exact TCP segment size / packet boundary, then “SIP packet” appended and posted via web form</li>
<li><b>victim IP stack breaks the POST into multiple TCP packets, leaving the "SIP packet" (as part of POST data) in its own TCP packet without any accompanying HTTP headers</b></li>
<li>if browser alters size of multipart/form boundary (Firefox) or packet size changes for any other reason, size change is communicated back to client and client auto-resends with new size</li>
<li>when opening UDP port, SIP packet is sent over TURN protocol inside specially crafted <code>username</code> field forcing IP fragmentation and precise boundary control</li>
</ul></li>
<li>(v2) "H.323 packet" using TCP-based STUN (bypassing patches for v1 and browser port restrictions) connection generated, containing internal IP to trigger Application Level Gateway connection tracking, but forcing a redirect to <strong>any other host on the network</strong> in a "call forwarding" packet
<ul>
<li>"H.323 call forward" to server on TCP port 1720 (H.323 port) initiated, avoiding <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/samyk/chromium/blob/2d57e5b8afc6d01b344a8d95d3470d46b35845c5/net/base/port_util.cc#L20-L90">restricted browser ports</a>, despite the port being blocked -- port evasion performed by using WebRTC STUN feature which does not respect the restricted port list</li>
<li><code>username</code> field is "stuffed" to exact TCP segment size / packet boundary, then “H.323 packet” appended and posted via web form</li>
<li><b>victim IP stack breaks the POST into multiple TCP packets, leaving the "H.323 packet" (as part of STUN data) in its own TCP packet without any accompanying HTTP headers</b></li>
<li>if browser alters size of multipart/form boundary (Firefox) or packet size changes for any other reason, size change is communicated back to client and client auto-resends with new size</li>
</ul></li>
<li>victim NAT sees proper SIP REGISTER packet on SIP port or proper H.323 call forward packet (with no HTTP data), triggering ALG to open any TCP/UDP port defined in packet back to any victim host on the network
<ul>
<li>victim NAT rewrites SIP or H.323 packet, replacing internal IP with public IP, hinting to attacker exploit was successful</li>
<li>(v2) as H.323 call forwarding can direct to any other IP, packet can contain any internal IP of any other host on the victim's network, triggering the NAT to port forward to any system on the network</li>
<li>even if victim NAT normally rewrites source ports, the ALG will still be forced to port forward to the attacker's port of choice as it believes victim machine (or other machine on the network, entirely determined by attacker) opened that port and attacker sees new source port in arriving SIP/H.323 packet </li>
<li><b>attacker can now bypass victim NAT and connect directly back to any port on any machine on the network, exposing previously protected/hidden services and systems</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li><i>to investigate...perhaps by you?</i>
<ul>
  <li>non-malicious usage: this technique essentially gives browsers full TCP and UDP socket capability to communicate to any protocol locally on the system; the connection can be abstracted through a cloud server that connects back but the browser just talks to the cloud server as if it's the socket and makes browsers much more powerful to communicate on non-web-friendly protocols</li>
  <li>if testing in a virtual machine (VM) using shared networking (used to protect a host from attacks by routing it through the host, not letting it directly onto the network), if the packets make it out, the parent host machine is where the ports end up getting opened, not the VM ;)</li>
  <li>IP fragmentation allows full control of all data in the IP data section, meaning full control of the <b>UDP header</b>, including source/dest ports in the overflowed packet...what else could this abuse?</li>
</ul></li>

<h2 id="network-address-translation-nat">Network Address Translation (NAT)</h2>

<p>We use NATs (Network Address Translation) for several reasons. The most useful feature of NAT is that it allows a single public IP address to be shared among multiple systems. It does this by creating a local network, providing local IP addresses to all machines that connect, and when one of those systems reaches out to the Internet, it rewrites packets going out to use the public IP so responses come back to the NAT, and vice versa, rewriting destination IP to specific client's IP. </p>

<p>It's the responsibility of the NAT to differentiate connections to the same addresses/ports (google.com:443) from internal hosts as ultimately their outbound port, destination ip and source ip will all be the same. If two different internal peers attempt to connect from the same source port, modern NATs will alter one of the source ports (some networks do this to all TCP/UDP source ports).</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samyk/slipstream/main/img/lan.png" alt="NAT"></p>

<h3 id="connection-tracking">Connection Tracking</h3>

<p>From <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Netfilter">Wikipedia à la Wikiwand</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code>One of the important features built on top of the Netfilter 
framework is connection tracking. Connection tracking 
allows the kernel to keep track of all logical network 
connections or sessions, and thereby relate all of the packets
which may make up that connection. NAT relies on this 
information to translate all related packets in the same way, 
and iptables can use this information to act as a stateful 
firewall.</code></pre></div>

<p>If a machine behind your NAT sends a packet out and your router expects the remote host may respond, it keeps track of information, specifically the source and destination ports, source and destination IP addresses, and your internal IP, then returns any packets matching it back to your internal IP.</p>

<p>If another host on your LAN attempts to make the same connection with the same source and destination ports + IPs, your NAT wouldn't be able to discriminate it (the source IPs are different on your LAN but are rewritten to the same public IP on the WAN side), so it alters the source port, but rewrites it when sending back to you.</p>

<h3 id="application-level-gateway">Application Level Gateway</h3>

<p>ALGs allow NAT to track a multi-port protocol like FTP to go out from your system to an FTP server, then track when you request a file to be sent to your internal IP on a specific port, the ALG can rewrite the packet to include your public IP, then forward the FTP's server connection back to you. Had it not rewritten your IP, the FTP server would try to connect back to you on your internal IP (or not try at all if it expects the source IP to be the same as the signaling connection).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>New research gives patients with <span>PTSD</span> the power to restore their own patterns of brain activity</p><div>
    <div>
          <div property="content:encoded"><p><strong>LHSC: University Hospital&nbsp;-&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In a new study at Lawson Health Research Institute (Lawson) and the University of Geneva, researchers showed that a technique called brain training can be used to restore patterns of brain activity and reduce symptoms of hyperarousal in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (<span>PTSD</span>).</p>
<p>Individuals with <span>PTSD</span> often experience more random patterns of brain activity. A leading symptom of <span>PTSD</span> is hyperarousal, which is associated with defensive responses to stress or triggers. A technique to restore patterns of brain activity to a more balanced order and reduce hyperarousal therefore holds promise as a potential treatment.</p>
<p>With the brain training technique, also called neurofeedback, patients exercise their own brain activity through a circular neurofeedback loop, which acts as a mirror to display brain activity. This is done through a brain-computer interface that records brain signals through sensors on the scalp. Since brain activity is displayed on screen, users can complete brain training exercises in ways similar to a gym workout.</p>
<p>In this study, led by Lawson’s Dr. Ruth Lanius, the goal was for patients with <span>PTSD</span> to reduce the intensity of the brain’s dominant brain wave - the alpha rhythm. Patients used neurofeedback to visualize their brain activity as they played a simple video training game. The 30-minute game consisted of a space ship displayed on a starry background. When patients were successful in reducing their alpha rhythm, the space ship moved forward.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>“Patients reported reducing the dominant brain wave by concentrating their attention towards the visuals on screen. This seemed to propel the spaceship forward,” said Dr. Ruth Lanius, a scientist at Lawson and a psychiatrist at London Health Sciences Centre. “This is consistent with prior research that suggests the alpha rhythm is reduced with increased processing of attention.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The researchers were surprised to find the reduction in alpha rhythm resulted in lasting changes. After the initial reduction, the alpha rhythm rebounded, or increased, to levels matching those found in healthy individuals. Patterns of brain activity were restored to a more proportional balance that is associated with healthy brain function.</p>
<p>Following&nbsp;these sessions, patients experienced a decrease in hyperarousal. “This is very significant. Neurofeedback may give patients the power to restore their patterns of brain activity and improve symptoms of psychiatric illness,” said Dr. Lanius, who is also a professor in the Department of Psychiatry at Western University’s Schulich School of Medicine <span>&amp;</span> Dentistry. “This means that existing mechanisms of the human brain may be harnessed for therapy, providing an alternative to pharmaceutical and brain stimulation therapies.”</p>
<p>Dr. Lanius and her collaborators are currently continuing this research with a larger group of patients with <span>PTSD</span>. Patients in this study will complete multiple sessions of brain training to determine whether positive effects can be sustained long-term.</p>
<p>The study, “<a href="http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/09/12/cercor.bhw285.abstract" rel="nofollow">Neurofeedback tunes scale-free dynamics in spontaneous brain activity</a>”, was published in the journal <em>Cerebral Cortex</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>20,000 had died as a result of the tsunami by the time I spoke with Joi. Three reactor cores had melted. Unknown to most at the time, sixteen radioactive <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-49379-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plumes</a> were sweeping across the Fukushima countryside. Families across the nation, some being <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK253930/table/tab_6-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relocated</a> and all glued to the news, were asking: Are we safe? Should we stay indoors? Can our children drink the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3701991/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">milk</a>?</p>
<p>There were no clear answers, but there was plenty of speculation. Datasets available to the government and power company were withheld from the public. Scientists across the world, eager to evaluate the situation, were left guessing.</p>
<p>That day in March 2011, Joi told me that he and a small cast of characters had assembled a rough plan for <em>Open Global Sensing</em>. I’d just left Microsoft where, in my role as Chief Software Architect, I’d started and nurtured a new product called <em>Azure</em>. “We could use your cloud and data expertise. Will you join us?</p>

<p>A few weeks later 15 of us <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/seanbonner/5629245498/in/album-72157626383390989/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">met</a> in Tokyo, came together around a mission, and set off to Akihabara. Within days, a volunteer’s car had been <a href="https://safecast.org/2011/04/first-safecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">armed</a> with a laptop, a GPS, and a high-quality Geiger counter. The team began mapping radiation levels and uploading them as CC0-licensed data for all the world to see. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-0434-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Citizens became scientists</a>, and <a href="https://safecast.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Safecast</a> was born.</p>

<p>Over 10 years, using more than two thousand sensors, more than ten thousand volunteers have worked to gather a <a href="https://map.safecast.org/?y=37.28&amp;x=139.7&amp;z=8&amp;l=0&amp;m=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rapidly growing dataset and map</a> of hundreds of millions of data points. During that time, the team has used commercial IoT technology to create <a href="https://safecast.org/devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ten generations of sensors</a> – some fixed, some mobile. Some measuring radiation, some air quality. Some hard-wired, some solar powered. With support of several <a href="https://safecast.org/donate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generous benefactors</a>, Safecast’s citizen scientist volunteers have managed to build one of the largest open environmental datasets in existence.</p>
<figure><a href="https://map.safecast.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    <img src="https://blues.io/blog/images/safecast-map.png" alt="Screenshot the live map at Safecast.org"> </a><figcaption><a href="https://map.safecast.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But gathering that data was far, far too difficult. If we’re to benefit from a world of devices that are cloud-connected from birth, IoT needs a new soul.</p>
<h2 id="surfing-the-public-airwaves">Surfing the Public Airwaves</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I came to believe that the only viable business model for large-scale cellular IoT is the <em>Kindle’s Whispernet</em> model, where the lifetime cost of cellular is simply embedded into the cost of the product.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Low data-rate applications don’t need the complexity of Linux, containers, or edge computing. For these solutions, AI/ML is best done in the cloud, with microcontroller-based device design focused on simplicity, reliability, low power, and low cost.</p>
<p>The earliest Safecast devices recorded their data onto SD cards. We embraced Bluetooth for mobile phone-based upload, and then <a href="https://www.semtech.com/lora/what-is-lora" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LoRa</a> and <a href="https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LoRaWAN</a> for fixed location backhaul. LoRa is an amazing technology, and we came close to becoming addicted due to its low power and low cost. But being a global project with a low density of devices, each time we deployed a sensor we ended up needing to build our own network – a consuming undertaking that was greatly complicated by the fact that LoRa chips and concentrators and spectrum rules vary around the world.</p>
<p>The answer, of course, was to use the globally-harmonized public airwaves of cellular.</p>
<p>But what a nightmare! Cellular has huge power draw; it’s a significant challenge for hardware developers to build battery-powered cellular devices. Cellular modems have arcane interfaces and are extremely awkward for developers to deal with. Carriers and cloud providers now (rightfully) require device certificates, TLS, and firmware update, adding even more complexity to the simple task of uploading just a little bit of data.</p>
<p>What’s more, the cellular business model of charging “per month per device” is fundamentally flawed for narrowband cellular IoT, where devices are very high-volume, low-cost, and may even be discarded. Charge the user? Charge the vendor? Charge even when it’s broken? I came to believe that the only viable business model for large-scale cellular IoT is the <em>Kindle’s Whispernet</em> model, where the lifetime cost of cellular is simply embedded into the cost of the product. For the user, <em>it just works</em>.</p>
<h2 id="a-simple-data-pump">A Simple Data Pump</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re counting on you software folks to solve that problem, Ray.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For many applications – including Safecasts’s – all you need is a simple <em>data pump</em>. Take a little bit of data, perhaps hourly or daily, format it in a simple way, like JSON, and deliver it securely to a cloud-based app via REST. Is that too much to ask?</p>
<p>Before investing more time and energy on this problem at Safecast, I began to talk to others in the industry. Does anybody have a simple way of dealing with low-power cellular from a developer perspective? No one did.</p>
<p>Next, I decided to talk with a number of the thousands of commercial and industrial customers I’ve met with over the years. I heard horror stories about how they tried cellular and gave up. Stories of how they tried Wi-Fi, and now want to bail because it’s a complete <a href="https://www.inc.com/will-yakowicz/a-smart-refrigerator-can-take-down-your-business.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cesspool</a>. To a customer, they were all stories of frustration.</p>
<p>I happen to be very close to the leadership of a few cellular carriers, and so I pressed them: How are you (as an industry) going to realize the promise of cellular if it’s so difficult for developers to use?</p>
<p>Their answer? “We’re counting on you software folks to solve that problem, Ray.”</p>
<p>And so began another journey.</p>
<h2 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Today’s opportunity is not just about improving our own interactions, but in learning how best to collaborate <em>with machines</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In building Lotus Notes, Groove, and Talko, I’ve spent decades of my career building software in the field of <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-encyclopedia-of-human-computer-interaction-2nd-ed/computer-supported-cooperative-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Computer-Supported Cooperative Work</a>. In the soul of that software was the aspiration to improve outcomes by qualitatively improving interactions among co-workers.</p>
<p>Today’s opportunity is not just about improving our own interactions, but in learning how best to collaborate <em>with machines</em>. Distributed networks of sensors can enable us to know what’s happening in our environment; in our fleets; in our patients; in the COVID vaccination delivery chain; in our food supply; in our HVAC systems; at the entrances to our offices.</p>
<p>Sensors and controls will be ubiquitous in business. They should give us greater <em>situational awareness</em> and should empower us to work together more effectively and serve customers more effectively.</p>
<p>In starting and leading Blues Wireless, my objective is to make it possible for every organization to be able to collaborate with machines to improve their business and improve the world, through visibility, transparency, and control.</p>
<p>We’ve built a few new components – the <a href="https://blues.io/products/"><em>Notecard</em></a> and the <a href="https://notehub.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Notehub</em></a> – that have the potential to fundamentally change the game in the cellular world. With its Safecast roots, simplicity and <em>IoT for good</em> are at the soul of the Notecard.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://blues.io/blog/images/notecard.png" alt="Close-up photo of the Notecard."> <figcaption>
            <p>Our first product, the Notecard.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But with my own roots being in the commercial world, they’re packaged it in a form that you can use to embed this <em>cloud data pump</em> in your product. Your machine.</p>
<p>Perhaps something that notifies you when a rodent trap or dumpster needs to be emptied, to keep our alleys clean. Or something that sends an alert when the power goes out on a fridge full of medication. Or something that takes action when a low-income tenant’s home gets too cold.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with fancy expensive devices that do edge computing and local AI, but we love dumb old devices at Blues. We love ‘brownfield’ and we love retrofits. The simpler, the cheaper, the broader, the better.</p>
<p>Because it’s our dream that by monitoring the environment at a personal, grassroots level, we can be better educated and in touch with our earth. We’re committed to help make that happen.</p>
<p>But it’s also our dream that by adding simple inexpensive monitors for our food, our fuel, our fridges, our health, that the benefits of the ‘cloud’ and the ‘edge’ can extend to everyone, including the old, the disadvantaged, and the under-served.</p>
<p>It’s our dream that once you see how easy it is to make your product <em>cloud connected from birth</em>, that this little cloud data pump – the Notecard – might <em>itself</em> turn out to be the soul of a new machine: yours.</p>

<p>At the start of December, I switched jobs to a new games company. While I really enjoyed being a lead programmer at my previous company, I found it difficult to combine both my leadership and programming responsibilities. I ended up feeling like I wasn’t doing my best work on either. My calendar often looked like Swiss cheese, with small meetings interspersed throughout my day. I’ve taken a step back on my leadership responsibilities now, so I can focus more on writing code.</p>



<p>But since my new job didn’t start for another six weeks, I decided to run an experiment on myself. I’ve always been curious about whether an 8-hour workday was actually optimal for me. Now that I had no boss to report to and no coworkers to keep in the loop, why not try cutting my work hours in half? My hope was that I would be able to achieve some kind of momentum on my personal project. I’m happy to report this was definitely the case and that I’ve learned a lot, more than can fit in a single blog post!</p>

<p>My game <em>Up There They Love</em> has been in production in some shape or form for almost three years now. While I had always intended for it to be a “forever project”, something that I could always return to when inspiration struck, it also felt kind of stuck in development hell. Games are meant to be played and I never got to the point where players could actually do that.</p>



<p>To explain it briefly, <em>Up There They Love</em> is an adult visual novel combined with a character management sim and a sexy card game. I designed all of the mechanics, programmed the whole game myself, and have done most of the writing. While friends have helped out over the years, this has always been a solo project. And yes, I’m <a href="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/programming/building-a-tech-stack-for-my-visual-novel/">building my own engine</a>.</p>



<p>The state of the game in early December last year was that the character management sim had been (mostly) implemented already, but the visual novel had not received a lot of love and the card game was just an idea; it hadn’t been designed at all.</p>



<p>So now that I had some time between work assignments, I wanted to see how much I could get done on my game if I fully committed to it. Would I be able to implement the core loop of my game and finally get something playable?</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In this three-part series, I will explain some of the strategies I employed during this period and how effective they were for my productivity.</p>







<p>This experiment did not form in a vacuum. I had recently read the book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37880811-make-time" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37880811-make-time">Make Time</a> and I felt highly inspired to try it out. What makes this book so great is that it isn’t about applying One Neat Trick that will instantly fix your entire life but instead asks you to pick a few things that suit your style of working from a list of 80 different tactics.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/maketime.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/maketime-1024x768.jpg" data-src="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/maketime-1024x768.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/maketime-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/maketime-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/maketime-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/maketime.jpg 1280w" data-sizes="(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px" srcset="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/maketime-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/maketime-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/maketime-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/maketime.jpg 1280w"></a></figure>



<p>There were a number of tips that I implemented immediately, but I also wanted to try out a few ideas of my own. Specifically, I wanted to see how far I could get by working very intensely on my game, but for only four hours a day.</p>



<p>I wanted to do all of my work between 8 AM and noon, have lunch, and then do something else for the rest of the day. The idea being that I could get a lot done on my game while also having more time for other activities that bring me joy, like lazily watching my shows on the couch.</p>



<p>I’m happy to report that this experiment was a resounding success. I was able to make <em>incredible </em>progress on my game while also streaming a season and a half of the brilliant superhero drama <em>The Boys</em>.</p>



<p>So how did I do all that?</p>







<p>One of the recommendations from <em>Make Time</em> is to turn off all notifications on your phone and other devices except those that you explicitly <em>want</em> to be interrupted by. The default on your phone is to interrupt you whenever, it’s high time to challenge that notion!</p>



<p>I decided to turn off all notifications except Google Calendar (meetings), LoseIt (diet tracking reminders), and WhatsApp (family &amp; friends). I also explicitly logged out of Twitter in the morning, which added some friction to wasting time on that website.</p>



<p>Next, I wanted to meticulously plan my mornings. I’m a morning person and get up at 6 AM every day, but I’m not always spending that time wisely. I decided to map out the two hours between 6 AM and 8 AM to an exact schedule:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-1024x576.png" data-src="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-1024x576.png" alt="" data-srcset="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-300x169.png 300w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-768x432.png 768w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine.png 1280w" data-sizes="(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px" srcset="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-300x169.png 300w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-768x432.png 768w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine.png 1280w"></a></figure>



<p>I’m able to do this is that I don’t have any children, I no longer have a commute, and my wife likes to sleep in until at least 8:30 AM. I’m therefore able to perfectly control my schedule in the morning, which definitely makes me an outlier. So don’t feel bad if you cannot apply this type of schedule to your own mornings!</p>



<p>My morning routine acknowledges my Twitter addiction, but I also explicitly block out time for planning my day. This does not always work out <em>perfectly</em>, but it does give me a much better chance of having a productive day.</p>







<p>Even though I no longer had any teammates to interrupt me, I still blocked out the time between 8 AM and noon in my calendar every day for doing focused work. This ensured that I would be in the right headspace and allow me to focus on getting stuff done. I would clear the notification from my phone when I started working, which helped me to get in the groove.</p>



<p>I stuck to this schedule for six weeks while waiting for my new job to begin. And the main thing I found is that I had to unlearn a lot of bad habits. It turns out that a lot of time at work is usually <a href="https://nesslabs.com/illusion-of-productivity">spent on busywork</a>! When I’m stuck on a problem at work, I tend to distract myself with e-mails or checking Twitter. But when your workday is only four hours, you really can’t afford to do that!</p>



<p>That’s why adding a bit of friction to Twitter was really useful. When I got stuck on a problem in one area, I would instead switch contexts to another area of my game. For example, I would work on the UI design when I was stuck on a coding problem and work on making temp art when I couldn’t figure out the game design.</p>



<p>Because I have ADHD, I find it very easy to slip into what the ADHD community calls “hyperfocus”. This is a mental state in which the whole world fades away and nothing becomes more important than the work in front of you. Getting into hyperfocus is in fact so easy for me to do that my main issue has always been getting <em>out</em> of this mental state. Setting a strict deadline helps with that: I can use my hyperfocus to get a lot done and I stop working when it’s time for lunch.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I did not always follow my own advice. There were definitely days that I worked beyond my four-hour limit. And I just want to put it in writing: <em>every time I did that was a mistake</em>. I did not get more done and instead just made myself jittery and anxious for no good reason. Hyperfocus is an extremely tiring mental state, it’s not possible to sustain it for more than a few hours without a serious crash the next day.</p>







<p>Working four hours a day for six week gave me 120 hours of time devoted to my game, or three full-time weeks. But I feel I got more done than that would imply. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Some of my accomplishments:</p>



<ul><li>All major gameplay systems implemented!</li><li>Implemented card game prototype in the actual game</li><li>Closed the gameplay loop from placement to night gameplay and back again</li><li>Created new temp art for 2 / 3 characters</li><li>Added code generation for widgets, screens, and Sass files</li><li>Converted most CSS to use <a href="https://css-tricks.com/abem-useful-adaptation-bem/">ABEM</a> naming scheme</li><li>Fixed not being able to use <a href="http://blog.bahraniapps.com/gifcam/">GifCam</a> to capture footage</li><li>Added base widget class that renders itself when internal state changes (future blog post material!)</li><li>Converted all widgets and screens in the game to use new base class</li><li>Added localization system and used it for all new screens in the game</li><li>Perfected nightly build system using <a href="http://www.buildout.org/en/latest/">buildout</a></li><li>Added animations to <a href="https://twitter.com/mrhands31/status/1349311128468398083">night gameplay</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mrhands31/status/1352583568262914049">task outcome</a> screens</li></ul>







<p>It’s clear to me that I can get a lot done if I focus on reducing distractions and focus my efforts where it matters. Now that I’m gainfully employed again, I don’t think it will be acceptable for me to tell my boss that I would like to do all of my work in four hours yet get paid for eight. But I will definitely carry some of the learnings from this experiment with me.</p>



<p>What I intend to do now is roughly divide my workday in two: mornings are for <strong>focused </strong>work like coding and solving technical problems, while afternoons are for <strong>collaborative </strong>work like writing documentation and doing code reviews. But since I’ll be working from home in the foreseeable future, I will definitely be sticking to my morning routine!</p>



<p>In the next parts of this series, I will discuss how I figure out my task priorities and how I used public accountability to keep myself motivated.</p>

        <p><strong>Hi! Dan and Nathan here.</strong> Early in 2020, we launched the Everything Bundle, a Substack devoted to productivity and business strategy. We started with two newsletters, Superorganizers and Divinations, written and produced by just us. Almost twelve months later, we now have eight newsletters in the bundle, written by some of the smartest, most accomplished practitioners in tech and startups: Li Jin, Tiago Forte, Nat Eliason, Jerry Colonna, and Sherrell Dorsey.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>The response has been far better than we ever anticipated: the Everything Bundle has been read by over 750,000 people, it has almost 2,400 paid subscribers, and has cracked the top 10 on Substackâ€™s paid newsletter leaderboard. To us, the signal is clear that there is value in a bundle like this. Readers want access to a place that consistently delivers business writing from a variety of perspectivesâ€”for one subscription price.</p>

        <p>Weâ€™re proud of what weâ€™ve built so far, but we think itâ€™s just the start. Today we want to share where weâ€™re going, what we stand for, and why we exist. But first, a few announcements:</p>

        <h5>The Everything Bundle is now Every.</h5> 
        <p>We started by covering productivity and strategy, and our hope is to cover every industry and job role, every broad theme and niche interest. Weâ€™ve picked the name Every as one that reflects that scope.&nbsp;</p>

        <h5>Weâ€™re structured as a writer collectiveâ€”a new model for a media company.</h5>
        <p>Weâ€™ve been doing it for almost a year, and now weâ€™re ready to talk about it. A writer collective is a way to write thatâ€™s somewhere between starting a Substack and working for <em>The New York Times</em>. We give our writers financial upside in the work they do and the freedom to build their own creative vision, but we also support them with distribution to an audience, editorial support, and an advance on their subscription revenue if they need it. Weâ€™re excited to see ideas like this becoming <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/25/business/media/brick-house-journalism-cooperative.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">part</a> of the <a href="https://www.axios.com/forbes-paid-newsletter-subscriptions-ab423ae1-0b90-4863-acad-40a373adce80.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">zeitgeist</a>: we believe it is the best structure to support diverse voices, uncover undercovered topics, and create quality writing that can help our readers think differently about business and solve real-world problems.</p>

        <h5>Weâ€™ve moved onto our own homegrown platform.</h5> 
        <p>Our business wouldnâ€™t exist without Substack, and we think the world of them, but weâ€™re excited to announce that Every will be run on a platform we built ourselves. Weâ€™re technology people. And as weâ€™ve grown, we keep coming up with ideas to make our product and business better. So we decided to build our own CMS, one that works differently from anything that already exists, and gives us the freedom to evolve it however we want as we seek new ways to meet the needs of our audience.&nbsp;</p>

        <h5>Weâ€™ve raised a pre-seed round from Eric Stromberg at Bedrock and a group of ambitious angels.</h5>
        <p>Weâ€™ve known Eric for many years, and because heâ€™s a former founder in the space and a&nbsp; current investor in The Athletic, Cameo, and Dipsea, we think heâ€™s the perfect person to help us build our vision.</p>

        <p>Weâ€™re building Every because we believe there is someone in every industryâ€”from wealth management to waste managementâ€”whose eyes sparkle when they talk about their work. These people are ambitious, and they are curious. They think of business as a subject that is intellectually interesting, and as an activity that can be pursued not just for personal gain, but also as an expression of soul. They care deeply about what they do because they see how it connects to the lives of the people they serve: they can tell you how everything in the world depends on their job getting done.</p>

        <p>You have never heard of most of these people, but they are out there. We hope to find them and bring them to our readersâ€”by writing about them, and by writing with them. We believe by doing so, we can help build a better world: the stories told today become the businesses built tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Weâ€™ve dedicated ourselves to this mission because we believe great business writing is currently too rare. Weâ€™d love to walk you why we think itâ€™s rare, and how a writer collective can help make more of it.</p>

        <h2>Why is great business writing rare?&nbsp;</h2>
        <p>There is more business writing on the internet than a single mind can fathom. Much of it is amazing, but as we all sadly know, thereâ€™s a lot that isâ€¦ not. Weâ€™re all burned and burdened by the glut of â€œthink pieces,â€� advertorials, and hastily composed posts that donâ€™t reach for nuance or complexity.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>We think this happens for three primary reasons.</p>
        <h4>1 - Great business writing requires multiple skills</h4>
        <p>To write something great about business, you have to know something worth writing about, and you need to be able to write about it in a compelling way. Unfortunately, the number of people who can do both is vanishingly small.</p>
        
        <p>        
          <img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/static/rare-venn.jpg">
        </p>

        <p>Most of the people who know what theyâ€™re talking about donâ€™t write. Writing is hard, itâ€™s time consuming, and, honestly, itâ€™s agonizing. You canâ€™t take a magic pill and suddenly wake up as a compelling writerâ€”you just have to spend years and years doing it. Itâ€™s a craft.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>On the other hand, there are many skilled writers who donâ€™t have enough business knowledge. Or they simply donâ€™t have the time to dive deeply enough into their subject to do it justice. Which brings us to our second point.</p>

        <h4>2 - Writers are pressured to publish too often</h4>
        <p>Great writing takes time. Yes, thereâ€™s the time it takes to write and edit. But it also takes time to experience things worth writing about, to reflect, and to learn. Thereâ€™s no shortcut or trick that can solve this constraint. Thatâ€™s why the best writing, often found in books and magazines, develops over months, if not years.</p>

        <p>Of course that timescale is rare on the internet. Writers who work for ad-supported digital publications often need to produce daily, if not multiple times a day. Solo paid newsletters need to publish at least weekly, if not 2-3 times a week. Weâ€™ve done this ourselves, and some of our favorite writers do it with a level of quality and consistency that boggles the mindâ€”but itâ€™s grueling. You get burned out. We did.</p>

        <p>When youâ€™re burned out, you forget what inspired you to start writing in the first place. You scroll through Twitter â€œlooking for ideasâ€� and contemplate a career change to carpentry, until, defeated, you curl into a nap. You realize that your sense of curiosity, rather than driving your work, is currently in hidingâ€”which brings us to our third point.</p>

        <h4>3 - Most writing is chasing clout, rather than insight</h4>
        <p>Every writer wants clout. But when you prioritize clout over curiosity, the work suffers. You try to play up popular narratives. You worry about keeping up.&nbsp; You look at what everyone else is writing about, and you try to write the same thingâ€”but better. You opine on every trending topicâ€”even when you donâ€™t have anything new to add to the conversation. You say dumb things to get attention. (Okay, to be fair, we have <a href="https://every.to/divinations/quibi-will-be-a-multi-billion-dollar-355585" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">done that</a> ourselves, but at least hopefully in an interesting way ðŸ™ˆ.)</p>

        <p>This strategy can attract attention, but it leaves readers unsatisfied, and doesnâ€™t age well. Itâ€™s like blowing counterclockwise into a hurricane and claiming credit when it reaches a Category 5. Aiming directly for clout is all about profiting from trends, rather than creating them. Itâ€™s about answering questions that have already been asked, not about asking new questions.</p>

        <p>When you put all of these forces togetherâ€”an arena that requires multiple skills to succeed, the incessant pressure to publish, and the human tendency to chase cloutâ€”you end up with a lot of writing thatâ€™s kind of like cotton candy. It tastes good at first, but it gives you a stomachache after a while. Worse, it creates a narrative ecosystem that rewards folks who already have money and an audience, rather than reflecting the best of what our community knowsâ€”and wants to knowâ€”about the world.</p>

        <p>So, what to do? Write together, rather than alone.&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>How writing together solves these problems</h2>
        <p>Writing together isnâ€™t trending right now, but itâ€™s actually pretty great.&nbsp;</p>

        <ol>
         <li>When you write together, you donâ€™t need one person to have both business knowledge and writing talent. You can find one person who has business knowledge and another person who has writing skill, and then create systems that support them writing together. Now youâ€™ve unlocked both business experience and writing talent in a way that wasnâ€™t possible before.</li>
         <li>When you write together, you donâ€™t have to publish so often that you risk burning out. Instead, the group can share the load. That means each writer has time to produce higher quality work, but readers still get content on a consistent schedule.</li>
  
         <li>And finally, when you write together, you can form a culture that pushes you to write from a genuine sense of curiosity, expertise, and interest, rather than clout-chasing. You can hold each other accountable to this when you veer away from it, and you can encourage each other to pursue the fragile little sparks of inspiration that turn into the best pieces. You start to care more about the respect of the community youâ€™re part of than about mindlessly moving numbers.&nbsp;</li>
       </ol>

       <p>Of course, weâ€™re not the first people to discover the merits of writing in groupsâ€¦&nbsp;</p>

       <h2>Magazines. Youâ€™ve invented magazines.</h2>
       <p>Turns out, traditional publishers have already solved this problem! Wouldnâ€™t it be ironic if the future of media looked exactly like the past? A great unbundling, resulting in a speedy rebundling into the exact same structures that existed before?</p>

Load balancing is the activity of effectively distributing traffic load across multiple servers.</p><p>This is how we achieve highly available applications that help us achieve scaling effectively.</p><h2>What is load-balancing?</h2><p><span>- Advertisement -</span> <ins data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1198872678846288" data-ad-slot="2989761355"></ins> </p><p>Since nobody can afford a web server overload, we scale out our backend servers to multiple machines. The aim is to have a distributed architecture and to avoid having all users connecting to a single server and choke it up. Therefore we distribute the incoming traffic by making use of a load balancer.</p><figure><img src="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-1024x582.png" alt="load balancing" width="762" height="433" srcset="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-1024x582.png 1024w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-300x170.png 300w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-768x436.png 768w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-696x395.png 696w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing.png 1070w" sizes="(max-width: 762px) 100vw, 762px"></figure><p>The load balancer thus becomes a key component in our architecture, diverting traffic based on different techniques that we will discuss later in this post. Its main responsibility is to avoid convergence of traffic and thus avoiding choking of the system.</p><p>Load balancers thus become the first point of contact for the client requests.</p><p>There can be multiple load balancers in a system as well. One each for various tiers of the application. This would help handle the separate application tiers more effectively and also scale them independently if needed.</p><figure><img src="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-1024x472.png" alt="load balancing multiple tiers" srcset="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-1024x472.png 1024w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-300x138.png 300w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-768x354.png 768w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-696x321.png 696w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers.png 1276w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>It is also important to mention that when a load balancer redirects to a particular location, it might not hit an application server. It might hit another load balancer that is implemented at a location-based cluster in a data center if we were scaling globally.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>If a server goes down, the load balancer also ensures that no traffic is directed to that server until it is back up and running. This is done by performing health checks that ensure the load balancer is only sending traffic to servers that are online.</p><p>But how do we decide which machine the user will land upon?</p><h2>Types of load balancing</h2><p>There are three types of load balancing:</p><ol><li>DNS load balancing</li><li>Hardware-based load balancing</li><li>Software-based load balancing</li></ol><p>As with everything, there are pros and cons to either of the approaches. Let us discuss them in detail.</p><h2>DNS load balancing</h2><p>DNS load balancing is the most commonly used technique for load balancing. Instead of having dedicated hardware for resolving which server to redirect to, a nameserver is responsible for managing traffic.</p><p>The nameserver has a list of IP addresses that correspond to the various servers that can be routed to. Every time someone queries for a particular domain, the nameserver returns this list of IP addresses and changes the order of the addresses. The reordering is done in a round-robin fashion. Thus, every new request is routed to a different machine in a round-robin order And the load gets distributed among different servers.</p><p>The reason a list of IP addresses is returned and not a single IP address is to have a failover strategy. If the first IP address does not respond in a stipulated amount of time, the client can call the next IP address in the list.</p><p>Though this is a popular strategy, it has its limitations too. What the strategy does not factor in is the existing load on the server, the processing time of the server, their online status, etc.</p><p>Another limitation of this technique is that IP addresses are cached on the client machine’s DNS resolver. This can be mitigated by setting a low TTL (time to live, or how long to store the mapping for). But it is a tradeoff since longer TTL means clients do not know about changes and shorter TTL may improve accuracy but increases DNS processing and DNS caching was implemented to mitigate that in the first place. Also, the client might choose to disregard your TTL value altogether. So it is not guaranteed.</p><p>Another limitation is of possibly routing to a machine that is not functional will exist. Though most cloud services these days do provide health checks along with DNS balancing these days, but it might not be true for all services.</p><p>The most common use case for this type of load balancing is for distributing traffic across multiple data centers, possibly in different regions. It is also preferred by companies because it is a cost-effective solution and easy to deploy.</p><h2>Hardware-based load balancing</h2><p>As the name suggests, we use physical appliances as a load balancer. They sit in front of the application servers and handle the distribution of traffic.</p><p>These are highly performant pieces of hardware that factor in the number of open connections, how much compute is being utilized and several other parameters to decide where to route the traffic to.</p><p>Having dedicated hardware to take care of load balancing is highly performant. It also is efficient since a dedicated machine is responsible for evaluating load distribution. The throughput is fast because of the specialized processors. It also provides the benefit of increased security since physical access to the hardware can be limited by the organization.</p><p>But hardware is expensive to purchase, to set up and it requires maintenance and regular updates. It can also require network specialists since it can be a lot of work to do for a developer.</p><p>Another disadvantage is that we have to factor in the scenarios where there is extreme peak traffic and plan for purchasing hardware accordingly. This is not the case for software-based load balancers.</p><h2>Software-based load balancing</h2><p>Software-based load balancing is the process of installing load balancing software on cost-effective hardware and VMs. They are cheaper and provide more flexibility than the hardware ones. They can also be provisioned and upgraded easily.</p><p>The major benefit of software-based load balancers over DNS load balancers is the flexibility and the advanced configuration options. We can configure load balancing on the basis of multiple parameters like cookies, HTTP headers, CPU utilization, memory consumption, network load, etc. We will discuss the different algorithms that can be implemented in detail later.</p><p>A benefit of the software-based approach over the hardware one is that we can scale beyond the initial capacity by just adding more VM based instances. No need to buy additional specialized hardware. We also would have to plan ahead of time for peak traffic if we were buying specialized hardware to manage it. In the cloud, there are no hardware balancers, and you purchase more virtual machines to fulfill your needs. This ends up being cheaper.</p><p>There are many “software-balancers as a service” services out there that allow us to use them without any configuration of our own. Or we can install the software from one of the open-sourced versions ourselves. <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/haproxy/haproxy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HAProxy</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nginx/nginx" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nginx</a> are fairly common ones that many enterprises use as well.</p><p>Since there are a lot of ways in which the software-based load balancers can be configured, we will discuss the major algorithms to do so next.</p><h3>Traffic routing algorithms used by software balancers</h3><p><strong>Round Robin: </strong>Similar to DNS based routing, a software uses a list of IP addresses and rotates through this list on every request. Nothing else is taken as a parameter.</p><p><strong>Weighted round-robin</strong>: A modified variation of the round-robin in which the traffic is routed in a weighted manner. The weights are determined by the server’s traffic capacity and compute capabilities. Thus, machines that can handle more traffic get more of it relative to those that can handle less.</p><p><strong>Least connections:</strong> Traffic is redirected to the machine that has the least amount of current network connections. Similar to the previous one, there are two approaches. One assumes that all requests to a server take equal server resources. The other takes into account the server’s traffic capacity and compute capabilities while making the decision of least open connections.<br>This approach is a good candidate for scenarios where the connections are long-term ones and stay open for larger durations, such as live streams or gaming applications.</p><p><strong>Random:</strong> The load balancer picks two servers randomly and then using the least connections mechanism, sends the request to the one that gets selected.</p><p><strong>Hash-based: </strong>A key is defined on the basis of which distribution takes place. The key could be the client IP address, or the request URL, or both. Hashing the IP ensures that the requests from an IP are always redirected to the same server. This is useful in cases where the server has some in-memory data/cache about the user’s information.</p><p><strong>Least time:</strong> This builds up on the least connections method. The traffic is redirected to the server with the fewest active connections and the lowest average response time.</p><p>And that is all there is to know about the basics of load balancing. Load balancing plays a prominent role in distributed architectures and helps in scaling our applications. It also helps improve responsiveness and achieve high availability.</p><p>If you have any queries, feel free to drop a comment below.</p></div></div></div>]]>

        <p>We rendered the <a href="https://tranco-list.eu/">top 1 million pages</a> on the web, tracking every conceivable performance metric, logging every error, noting every requested URL. To our knowledge this produces the first dataset that connects performance, errors, and library use on the web. In this article we analyze what the data can tell us about creating high performance web sites.</p>
        <div>
            <p><b>1M </b> pages visited
            </p>
            <p><b>65</b> metrics per page

        <p>Can you do better than our analysis? We <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/indexhtml/web-performance-metrics">published the dataset to Kaggle</a>, so you can crunch the numbers yourself.</p>
        <h2>Why render a million web pages?</h2>
        <p>
            A common sentiment these days is that the web is somehow slower and buggier than it was 15 years ago. Because of an ever-growing pile of JavaScript and frameworks and webfonts and polyfills, we've eaten up all the gains that faster computers, networks and protocols have given us. Or so the argument goes. We wanted to check if this was actually true and try to find what common factors are causing slow and broken websites in 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
            The high level plan was simple: Scripting a web browser, having it render the root page of the top 1 million domains, and logging every conceivable metric: render times, request counts, repaints, JavaScript errors, libraries used, etc. With all this data, we can ask questions about how one factor correlates with another. What factors contribute most to slow render times? Which libraries are correlated with long time-to-interactive? What are the most common errors, and what's causing them?
        </p>
        <p>
            Gathering the data was a matter of writing a bit of code to use Puppeteer to script Chrome, firing up 200 EC2 instances, rendering a million web pages over the weekend, and praying that you've actually understood how AWS pricing works.
        </p>

        <h2>Overall numbers</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Protocol use for root HTML document</b></li>

            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 3 (0.08%)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>HTTP 2 is now more common than HTTP 1.1, but HTTP 3 is still rare. (Note: We're counting anything using the QUIC protocol as HTTP 3, even if Chrome sometimes reports this as HTTP 2 + QUIC.) This was for the root document, for linked resources the protocol numbers look a bit different.</p>

        <p>There's a handful of scripts that are linked on a large portion of web sites. This means we can expect these resources to be in cache, right? Not any more: Since Chrome 86, <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/10/http-cache-partitioning">resources requested from different domains will not share a cache</a>. Firefox is planning to implement the same. Safari has been splitting its cache like this for years.</p>

        <h2>What makes the web slow: Predicting time-to-interactive</h2>

        <p>
            Given this dataset of web pages and their load time metrics, it would be nice to learn something about what it is that makes web pages slow. We'll investigate the dominteractive metric, which is the time it takes before the document becomes interactive to the user. The simplest thing we could do is just to look at the correlation of each metric with dominteractive.
        </p>

        <p>
            <img src="https://catchjs.com/images/blog/errs-and-perf/dominteractive-correlation.png" alt="Correlations with dominteractive">
            </p><blockquote>Correlations of metrics with dominteractive</blockquote>
        
        <p>
            Essentially every metric is positively correlated with dominteractive, except the 0-1 variable indicating HTTP2 or greater. Many of these metrics are also positively correlated with each other. We need a more sophisticated approach to get at individual factors contributing to a high time-to-interactive.
        </p>

        <p>Some of the metrics are timings, measured in milliseconds. We can look at their box-plot to get an idea of where browsers are spending their time.</p>
        <div>
            <p><img src="https://catchjs.com/images/blog/errs-and-perf/timings-box-plot.png" alt="Box plot of web page timings"></p><blockquote>Box-plot of timing metrics. The orange line is the median, the box goes from the 25th to the 75th percentile.</blockquote>
        </div>
        <p>
            One way to get at the individual factors contributing to a high time-to-interactive is to do a linear regression, where we predict dominteractive from other metrics. That means we assign a weight to each metric and model the dominteractive time of a page as the weighted sum of the other metrics, plus some constant. An optimization algorithm sets the weights so as to minimize the prediction error over the whole dataset. The size of the weights found by the regression tells us something about how much each metric contributes to the slowness of the page.
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll exclude timing metrics from the regression. If we spend 500ms establishing a connection, that adds 500ms to dominteractive, but this is not a particularly interesting insight. Timing metrics are fundamentally <em>outcomes</em>. We want to learn what causes them.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Regression coefficients for metrics, predicting dominteractive</b></li>

        </ul>
        <p>
            The numbers in parenthesis are the regression coefficients learned by the optimization algorithm. You can interpret these as having units of milliseconds. While the exact numbers should be taken with a grain of salt (see note below), it is interesting to see the scale assigned to each feature. For example, the model predicts a 354ms slow down for every redirect needed to deliver the main document. Whenever the main HTML document is delivered via HTTP2 or higher, the model predicts a 477ms lower time-to-interactive. For each request triggered by the document, it predicts an additional 16 ms. 
        </p>

        <p>
            When interpreting regression coefficients, we need to keep in mind that we're operating on a simplified model of reality. Time-to-interactive is not in fact determined by a weighted sum of these input metrics. There are clearly causal factors the model has no chance of discovering. Confounding variables is clearly an issue. As an example, if loading the main document with HTTP2 is correlated with loading <i>other</i> requests over HTTP2, then the model will bake this advantage into the weights for main_doc_is_http2_or_greater, even if the speed up comes from requests other than the main document. We need to be cautious when mapping what the model says onto conclusions about reality.
        </p>

        <h3>What is the effect of HTTP protocol version on dominteractive?</h3>
        <p>Here's a fun plot of dominteractive split by the HTTP protocol version used to deliver the root HTML page.</p>
        <div>
            <p><img src="https://catchjs.com/images/blog/errs-and-perf/dominteractive-by-protocol.png" alt="Box-plot of dominteractive split by HTTP protocol version"></p><blockquote>Box-plot of dominteractive split by HTTP protocol version of the first request. The orange line is the median, the box goes from the 25th to the 75th percentile. The percentages in parenthesis are the fraction of requests made with this protocol.</blockquote>
        </div>

        <p>There's a tiny number of sites still delivered over HTTP 0.9 and 1.0. And these sites happen to be fast. It seems we can't disentangle the fact that protocols have gotten faster with the effect that programmers will happily consume this speed-up by delivering more stuff to the browser.</p>

        <p>This is for the protocol version used to deliver the root HTML page. What if we look at the effect of the protocol for resources linked in that document? If we do a regression on number of requests by protocol version, we get the following.</p>

        
        <p id="full-rs-expand"><a onclick="expandRs()">View regression code <span></span></a></p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><b>Regression coefficients for number of requests by protocol version, predicting dominteractive</b></li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http2_requests (14.18)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http3_requests (22.05)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http1_1_requests (25.14)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http1_0_requests (61.18)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If we were to believe this, we would conclude that moving requested resources from HTTP 1.1 to 2 gives a 1.8x speed-up, while going from HTTP 2 to 3 causes 0.6x slow down. Is it really true that HTTP 3 is a slower protocol? No: A more likely explanation is that HTTP 3 is rare, and that the few resources that are being sent over HTTP 3 (e.g. Google Analytics) are things that have a larger than average effect on dominteractive.</p>

        <h3>What is the effect of type of content on dominteractive?</h3>
        <p>Let's predict time-to-interactive from the number of bytes transferred, split by the type of data being transferred.</p>

        
        <p id="full-ts-expand"><a onclick="expandTs()">View regression code <span></span></a></p>
        

        <ul>
            <li><b>Regression coefficients for kilobytes transferred by request initiator, predicting dominteractive</b></li>

<p>In the past four years, I wrote three eBooks about programming. It’s like an
addiction.</p>
<p>I would be terrible at talking about writing techniques, so I won’t. But the
content is not everything when you write an eBook. You have to care about
creating <strong>beautiful files to release</strong>: PDF, ePub, Kindle…</p>
<p>Here is the story of how I built my eBooks, especially
<a href="https://gum.co/use-hooks">the last one</a>. After some trial and errors, in the
end, I used the same recipe as the two previous ones, and it involves a
fantastic tool: <strong>Pandoc</strong>.</p>

<p>I wanted my last eBook to be a practical guide, not an academic manual. So I
imagined a very <strong>custom design</strong>, with a <strong>dark theme</strong> and many colors (it is
not designed to be printed).</p>
<p>Since it was about coding, I also wanted to include some source code examples
with <strong>syntax highlighting</strong>.</p>
<p>Bust most of all, I wanted an efficient workflow.</p>

<p>I intended to release a first version of the book ASAP, then iterate thanks to
readers’ feedback and new ideas I had. For this reason, I wanted to focus on the
content and on the appearance <strong>independently</strong>.</p>

<p>I didn’t want to spend time on the presentation each time I updated the content.
I’m a web developer; it wouldn’t occur to me to edit my CSS each time I update
the HTML content. Same here.</p>

<p>I thought: why not just use <strong>MS Word</strong> or its Apple version, <strong>Pages</strong>? Well, I
tried. It didn’t go well.</p>
<p>You can customize pretty much everything you want. Every color, font family,
font size… But it gets trickier when you want to include source code.</p>
<p>Since I wanted to have syntax highlighting, the <em>less bad</em> solution I found was
to copy and paste from VS Code. At first, it looked (kind of) okay, but as soon
as I wanted to modify it, it went terribly: the formatting was lost, spaces were
inserted where I didn’t want them…</p>
<p>Definitely, these tools are not made to write content with embedded source code.</p>
<p>I also tried <strong>Illustrator</strong> and its open-source alternative,
<a href="https://www.scribus.net/"><strong>Scribus</strong></a>.</p>
<p>It was worse.</p>
<p>I admire people able to use these applications. They seem to require a lot of
training and practice. Unfortunately, I intended to release my book in the next
two years, so I didn’t have time to learn them. 😉</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m used to writing content using <strong>Markdown</strong>. Or in <strong>Slack</strong>. Or in
<strong>Notion</strong> (for this blog post). Today, we have such perfect tools for
writing. I didn’t want to struggle each time I update some examples.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, in the end, I relied on the tool I used for my previous books: <strong>Pandoc</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> is a command-line tool whose main feature is
converting some text (usually Markdown) to another format: HTML, ePub, PDF, etc.</p>
<p>I used it for my other books, and it’s perfect for “academic” work (thesis,
research articles). But I wasn’t sure that creating something a bit more
original, with shiny colors and such, was possible.</p>
<center>
<blockquote data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I spent around 5 hours to write the content, and lost the same amount of time looking for a publishing software or Saas to generate beautiful PDF for developer-oriented content, with source code. The winner ended being the good old Pandoc 😅</p>— Sébastien Castiel (@scastiel) <a href="https://twitter.com/scastiel/status/1338477555272331265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 14, 2020</a></blockquote>
</center>
<p>To write the content, I could now write using Markdown, with the basic
formatting options I needed: titles, italic, source code… And the source code
was highlighted!</p>
<p>By the way, syntax highlighting is themeable, and I really wanted to use
<a href="https://draculatheme.com/">Dracula</a>, which I already used for my VSCode. So I
created
<a href="https://gist.github.com/scastiel/4c409156ad4bc6a6dbbfe2abbd163671#file-dracula-theme">a custom theme</a>
for it. 🙂</p>

<p>The only thing I find problematic with Pandoc is
<a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html">its documentation</a>. It contains a lot of
information, but it’s on one page.</p>
<p>One page!</p>
<p>So you scroll, then scroll, and scroll again. And when you want to find
something, you do Cmd/Ctrl+F, type “color”, oh cool, there is something. Then
you realize you’re in the section concerning the generation of some obscure and
unknown document format…</p>
<p>Anyway, you can usually find what you’re looking for. I’d just prefer if it used
something more modern, such as Gitbook or Docusaurus, to maintain the
documentation and make it easier to navigate.</p>

<p>Pandoc is very good at generating HTML or an ePub file. You can give it some CSS
to customize anything you want. It would be a dream if you were able to do the
same to generate a customized PDF.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is slightly more complicated…</p>

<p>To generate PDFs, Pandoc uses <em>pdflatex</em>, which relies on
<strong><a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a></strong>. The LaTeX language is used to write
documents with a powerful but unusual syntax. These documents are then converted
to PDF, Postscript, etc.</p>
<p>So, a little like Pandoc. But with a weird syntax instead of beautiful Markdown.</p>
<p>Long story short, if you want to customize the PDF rendered by Pandoc with
<em>pdflatex</em>, you don’t have a choice: you need to provide some LaTeX code, a bit
like CSS.</p>
<p>And I didn’t want to spend several months learning LaTeX—it’s truly fantastic,
you can do anything you want with it. So I did what every good developer hates
doing: search on Google and copy-paste pieces of code.</p>
<p>Here is, for example, how I managed to have the book title in the page footer:
(sorry if you are a LaTeX guru, it probably will hurt your eyes)</p>
<pre><code><span>\usepackage</span><span>{</span><span>fancyhdr</span><span>}</span><br><span>\pagestyle</span><span>{</span>fancy<span>}</span><br><span>\fancyhf</span><span>{</span><span>}</span><br><span>\lfoot</span><span>{</span><br>  <span>\begin</span><span>{</span><span>tikzpicture</span><span>}</span><span>[</span>overlay,baseline=<span>{</span>(0,0)<span>}</span><span>]</span><br>  <span>\node</span><span>[</span>rectangle, outer sep=0pt, text=white, anchor=west <span>]</span><br>    (pageno)<br>    <span>{</span>A React Developer’s Guide to Hooks, © Sebastien Castiel<span>}</span>;<br>  <span>\draw</span><span>[</span>fill=comment, draw=comment<span>]</span><br>    (<span>[</span>xshift=-<span>\oddsidemargin</span>-1in<span>]</span>pageno.north west)<br>      rectangle<br>    (<span>[</span>yshift=1.5pt<span>]</span>pageno.south east);<br>  <span>\end</span><span>{</span><span>tikzpicture</span><span>}</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Well, to be fair, it would have been much more straightforward if I just wanted
the book title. But I wanted it in an indigo rectangle starting from the far
left of the page.</p>

<p>Still, most of the time, I was able to get what I wanted. It just took more time
than I wanted to spend on it.</p>
<p><em>You can find here
<a href="https://gist.github.com/scastiel/4c409156ad4bc6a6dbbfe2abbd163671#file-header-tex">the complete LaTeX header file</a>
I used for my book. I cleaned it a little and added some comments.</em></p>
<p>Although I didn’t interact with them, I’m sure the LaTeX community is fantastic
because you can find many resources on the Internet: answers on forums,
tutorials, manuals, etc.</p>

<p>I think the last time I used the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html">GNU make</a> utility was like
ten years ago. I had this idea that it was only used by C or C++ projects.</p>
<p>If you never heard of <strong>GNU make</strong>, it’s a utility program to run specific
commands to generate files. It’s mostly used to compile and build programs, but
you can use it for any command.</p>
<p>My first intuition was to write a shell script to generate my book in several
formats. Quickly, I realized a <strong>Makefile</strong> would make more sense:</p>
<ul>
<li>I had <em>content</em> files and <em>resource</em> files (images, the LaTeX header, for
example)</li>
<li>I needed to generate intermediate files, such as the cover as a PDF from a PNG</li>
<li>Some formats (ePub) were used to create other formats (Kindle)</li>
</ul>
<p>Using a Makefile, I regenerated only the needed parts, based on which files were
updated since the latest build. I could run <code>make pdf</code>, <code>make epub</code>,
<code>make mobi</code>, or just <code>make</code> to generate all formats.</p>
<p>Here is the portion of my Makefile used to generate the <em>ePub</em> and <em>mobi</em>
(Kindle) files:</p>
<pre><code>BOOK_TITLE <span>=</span> A\ React\ Developer’s\ Guide\ to\ Hooks\ -\ Sebastien\ Castiel<p><span>epub</span><span>:</span> dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.epub<br>  <span>@</span>echo <span>'✅  ePub'</span></p><p><span>kindle</span><span>:</span> dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.mobi<br>  <span>@</span>echo ‘✅  Kindle’</p><p><span>dist/<span>$</span>{BOOK_TITLE}.epub</span><span>:</span> dist content/*.md images/* resources/dracula.theme resources/metadata.xml resources/epub.css<br>  <span>@</span>pandoc content/foreword.md content/ch*.md content/resources.md \<br>  --output<span>=</span>dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.epub \<br>  --highlight-style resources/dracula.theme \<br>  --standalone \<br>  --epub-metadata<span>=</span>resources/metadata.xml \<br>  -c resources/epub.css \<br>  --epub-cover-image<span>=</span>cover.png \<br>  --toc --toc-depth<span>=</span>1 \<br>  --metadata title<span>=</span><span>"A React Developer’s Guide to Hooks"</span></p><p><span>dist/<span>$</span>{BOOK_TITLE}.mobi</span><span>:</span> dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.epub<br>  <span>@</span>kindlegen dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.epub -o <span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.mobi &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1</p></code></pre>
<p>Okay, maybe slightly overkill for my needs, but I felt so powerful! 💪🏻</p>
<p><em>You can find
<a href="https://gist.github.com/scastiel/4c409156ad4bc6a6dbbfe2abbd163671#file-makefile">here the complete Makefile</a>
for my book.</em></p>

<p>I embedded the examples’ source code in a small <strong>React</strong> application to run
them locally. The user can start it by running <code>yarn start</code> and navigate easily
through them.</p>
<p>Now, I feel a bit silly not to have thought of using
<a href="https://storybook.js.org/">Storybook</a>, which could have been a perfect
solution.</p>

<p>I created the cover using Apple Pages, sufficient for what I wanted to do. I
should <s>probably</s> definitely hire someone to create a more professional one.</p>

<p>I often design graphics using <strong><a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a></strong> (for
example, the banner for the <a href="https://gum.co/use-hooks">Gumroad page</a>), even if
at the end I manipulate and generate bitmap images. I know it’s not its first
purpose, but I find it easier to use than Gimp or commercial alternatives.</p>
<p>If you know a better choice, please please please tell me!</p>

<p>From the beginning, I really wanted a custom presentation with a dark theme.</p>
<p>Now, I realize this wish took me a lot of extra time. And I would have preferred
spending that time on the content. Plus, I don’t know if the readers actually
like this theme or not…</p>
<p>Also, it may have been better to focus first on the <strong>web support</strong>.
<a href="https://v2.docusaurus.io/">Docusaurus</a> could do an excellent job: readers could
navigate the sections, search for keywords, etc.</p>
<p>The PDF or ePub version would be secondary content: available, but maybe with a
generic appearance. So what?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the end, if the user finds the content useful, shouldn’t it be all that
matters?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will probably consider this change soon. Plus, I’d like to create a <strong>course</strong>
(without video) from the book’s content…</p>
<p>Regarding the workflow with Pandoc, I’m quite satisfied with it. Writing using
Markdown is lovely to focus on the content without caring how it will render.
And since Markdown is text, it’s easy to keep track of the history using Git. 🙂</p>

<p>I like poker, but I’m better at chess.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png" alt="Poker vs chess" width="499" height="451" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-347x314.png 347w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-694x628.png 694w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-768x695.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-1536x1389.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px"></a></p>
<p>Poker can be a lot of fun if you have a witty enough group of friends and a generous snack budget. There’s nothing worse than playing poker with a bunch of serious gamblers who think conversation and choice of hot wing spiciness are potential tells.</p>
<p>I like chess because nothing is hidden. I don’t like leaving things to chance, and I’m often foolish enough to believe I can figure out how to win if I have all the information.</p>
<p>In chess, there are no missing pieces. There isn’t a sneaky queen that your opponent can place on the board when you least expect it. Everything is in the open. The strategy and tactics are entirely determined by what is sitting in front of you in plain sight.</p>
<p>If I try to play poker the way I play chess, I’m going to lose. I can’t see all the cards. Information is hidden from me, and it’s information I need to make the right decisions.</p>
<p>If you can’t stand the uncertainty of poker, don’t do a startup. Don’t do an innovation project.</p>
<p>Innovation is like poker.</p>

<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11.png" alt="A group of people playing poker" width="599" height="441" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-427x314.png 427w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-853x628.png 853w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-768x565.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-1536x1130.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>

<h2>The Rules of Startup Poker</h2>
<p>This is not an ordinary game of poker. (So don’t worry if you’re not a poker player, this will still make sense.) I will stretch the analogy of Texas Hold ‘Em as far as I can in this special variation of Startup Poker.</p>
<p>Each player needs to pay the ante to play. This is a cheap game, so we’ll keep the ante at $1. Those are the costs of running an innovation project.</p>
<p>Each player gets dealt two cards that they can keep hidden. These cards represent the organization’s unique capabilities and business model — what they already have when they start.</p>

<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png" alt="A group of people playing poker part 2" width="599" height="450" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-418x314.png 418w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-836x628.png 836w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-768x577.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-1536x1154.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>As a normal Texas Hold ‘Em game progresses, the dealer will turn over additional cards in the middle of the table, which each player can use as part of their hand. First there are the three cards called “the Flop,” which are turned over at the same time. Then a fourth card is turned, which is called “Fourth Street” or “The Turn.” The last card is “the River.” Players can place bets before each of these rounds, trying to raise the stakes and force other players to fold.</p>

<p>In Startup Poker, all these shared cards represent the Market. The first three cards are “the Early Adopters.” The fourth card is “the Early Majority” and the last is “the Late Majority.” As the game goes on, the Market matures and players discover if they hold the winning hand.</p>
<p>The winner of the game is the person who has the best fit between the cards in their hand (which represents their business model) and the cards on the table (the Market). We can think of this as Product / Market fit or Business Model / Market fit.</p>

<p>The basic setup is the same, but remember, we are not playing regular Texas Hold ‘Em. Our rules are a bit different.</p>
<h2>Information Costs Money</h2>
<p>In Startup Poker, players have to ante another $1 every round to stay in. This is the cost of product development. (For our purposes, we are eliminating the standard Hold’em practice of “blinds,” which is a form of uneven antes.).</p>
<p>Additionally, instead of every round beginning by flipping over Market cards, players can get a preview by paying an additional $1 for each card. (In real poker, everyone sees the flipped card, but in our version you’re paying for a sneak peek.)</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png" alt="A poker player peeking at a flipped card" width="699" height="514" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-427x314.png 427w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-853x628.png 853w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-768x565.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-1536x1130.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px"></a></p>
<p>This is the equivalent of funding an <a href="https://kromatic.com/workshops/building-and-resourcing-teams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="innovation team" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked">innovation team</a> to gather Market information. This investment isn’t really just money, it’s blood, sweat, and tears. But since people * time = money, we’ll just use our poker chips to represent this investment. The team is really going out into the real world, talking to customers, putting up a landing page, or running some other form of experiment or research to gather information.</p>
<p>At that point, they have the option to kill the idea (fold) or persevere before a round of betting.</p>
<p>Should we go straight ahead and bet on our hand? Or should we buy a peek at the Market first?</p>
<h2>Bet It All in Waterfall</h2>
<p>We could just close our eyes and bet it all on our pair of jacks. This is the equivalent of <a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/lean-startup-in-the-enterprise-anti-pattern-the-lean-waterfall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">waterfall development</a>, where we place our bets and literally let the cards fall where they may.</p>
<p>We believe our cards are the correct ones for the Market, despite having not seen a single card from that Market. So we are placing a lot of faith in our business model and capabilities — our pair of jacks — and to be fair, that is a formidable hand.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png" alt="A player risking it all to bet in a poker game" width="599" height="405" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-465x314.png 465w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-929x628.png 929w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-768x519.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-1536x1038.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>But we’ve invested for the long hall, so we push it all in and check the snack bar while the hand plays out. But the Market isn’t kind. Our opponent starts with a 2 and a 4, but winds up closing a 2-6 straight with the 3, 5 and 6 from the Market. We lose to a weaker starting hand that ended up being better for that Market. We end up sitting in the corner binging on Pringles and lukewarm beer for the rest of the night while everyone else keeps playing, but that’s a risk of Waterfall.</p>
<h2>Information Has Value</h2>
<p>So instead of going all-in based on our business model and capabilities, should we buy that peek at the Market if we’re holding a pair of jacks?</p>
<p>The answer here is yes. Obviously so.</p>
<p>If everyone is sneaking a peek at the next card except you, you are at a huge disadvantage. Now they are playing chess because they can see more of the board. Meanwhile, you think you are still playing poker.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png" alt="A player playing chess blindfolded" width="512" height="565" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png 1812w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-285x314.png 285w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-569x628.png 569w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-768x847.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-1392x1536.png 1392w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></a></p>
<p>True, they still can’t see their opponents’ hole cards, so they don’t have all the information, but they have more than you.</p>
<p>So should you pay for the peek no matter what you are holding in your hand? Well, that depends on the cost.</p>
<h2>Don’t Play Every Hand</h2>
<p>If you start the game with a 2 of spades and a 9 of hearts, you have a bad hand. It’s not worth getting Market information because you are woefully unprepared for any Market. You might get lucky and find three twos on the board, but that’s a longshot. The odds are that someone else has a better hand. Just fold and play the next hand.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5.png" alt="2 Of spades and 9 of hearts" width="399" height="354" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-354x314.png 354w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-708x628.png 708w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-768x682.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-1536x1363.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px"></a></p>
<p>For large organizations, this is the equivalent of having an idea that is fundamentally mismatched with the company.</p>
<p>“Let’s make vegan hamburgers,” says the mining company.</p>
<p>This makes no sense. It is the 2/9 offsuit of business ideas. Let’s skip this idea and work on something with a little more promise.</p>
<h2>Pivoting</h2>
<p>In the real world, startups aren’t stuck with the cards that they are dealt. If something isn’t working with their business model, they can pivot.</p>
<p>You can also alter your product in Startup Poker, because after you peek at the cards on the board, we let you trade the cards in your hand — for a price. Each round, each player has the opportunity to trade in one card at a cost of $1. It’s an option to change your product / business model after you’ve gotten a taste of the market.</p>
<p>So let’s say you start with a pair of twos — one heart and one spade. You pay $3 to peek at three cards. They are the three, four, and five of hearts.</p>
<p>You might want to trade in your two of spades and get a new card from the deck, giving yourself a shot at a flush, a straight, or a straight flush.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png" alt="Early adopters vs business model" width="599" height="585" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-321x314.png 321w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-643x628.png 643w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-768x750.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-1536x1501.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>You are exercising an option to find a better fit with the Market. It’s only the information that you’ve gained by buying a peek at the Market that makes this pivot worthwhile.</p>
<h2>Arrogance</h2>
<p>Let’s face it, arrogance never helps in chess or in poker. Everytime I get cocky in chess, I lose.</p>
<p>Chess rankings are highly visible when playing. So when I relax for my lunchtime game and see that I’m playing someone with a rating 200 points below me, I know I’m going to win. Which is of course exactly when I’m going to lose.</p>
<p>I’m so confident in winning that I start checking my Slack messages while playing. Then I draft an email. Then I make some tea. I get distracted, forget my plan, and generally make a stupid mistake.</p>
<p>“Bad luck!” But there is no luck in chess — this is the folly of arrogance.</p>
<p>If we really wanted to make Startup Poker realistic, every player would be forced to drink 5 shots of bourbon before playing, then when they look at the two cards in their hand they’ll be convinced they have three of a kind. Every entrepreneur thinks they are the second coming of Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>Confidence is great. Good entrepreneurs don’t go into a market without some level of confidence. But arrogance allows your confidence to overrule your judgement.</p>
<h2>The Size of the Pot</h2>
<p>There’s another oddity to Startup Poker in that no one knows exactly how big the pot is. It is somewhat determined by the antes that people are paying in and the bets being made, but mostly it’s determined by the Market.</p>
<p>Of course, people can bet up the pot and force players to invest more to keep up. It’s the same as startups competing against each other. When one buys advertising, the others better match it or have a better strategy.</p>
<p>To calculate the value of the Market, we add up the value of the cards to determine the size of the pot (numbered cards are worth their face value, royal cards are worth $10, and aces are worth $15). So this makes buying Market information even more important.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png" alt="The size of the pot" width="699" height="356" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-600x306.png 600w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-1200x612.png 1200w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-768x391.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-1536x783.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px"></a></p>
<p>Don’t waste your money and time playing for a small pot.</p>
<h2>Crowded Markets</h2>
<p>Lastly, look at who is competing. It can be very compelling to play in a game with fewer people. Remember, the size of the prize is mostly determined by the Market, not the amount of competition. Unfortunately, in Startup Poker, players can join the game at any time.</p>
<p>When the dealer starts turning over Market cards, players who have not anteed up to that point can opt in. Of course at first they are at a disadvantage. They have missed at least one opportunity to get advanced information, and they’ve lost at least one opportunity to pivot. But they can still get into the Market — a Market that you’ve already invested in.</p>
<p>So if the first two cards the Market shows are a King and Jack, that’s $20 already in the pot. That might attract some latecomers to the game, and the competition might increase quickly.</p>

<p>Players who find themselves alone in a game at the early stages should still take advantage of the opportunity to get more information early, and to pivot if necessary. Even if …</p></div></div>

Using the <code>Entrypoint</code> and <code>Cmd</code> you discovered earlier, you can execute the intended startup command and see how the application is failing.</p><p>Depending on the container you’re running, it may be missing many of the tools necessary to debug your problem like: curl, lsof, vim; and if it’s someone else’s code, you probably don’t know which version of linux was used to create the image. We typically try all of the common package managers until we find the right one. Most containers these days use Alpine Linux (apk package manager) or a Debian, Ubuntu (apt-get package manager) based image. In some cases we’ve seen Centos and Fedora, which both use the yum package manager.</p><p>One of the following commands should work depending on the operating system:</p><ul><li><code>apk</code></li><li><code>apt-get</code></li><li><code>yum</code></li></ul><p>Dockerfile maintainers often remove the cache from the package manager to shrink the size of the image, so you may also need to run one of the following:</p><ul><li><code>apk update</code></li><li><code>apt-get update</code></li><li><code>yum makecache</code> </li></ul><p>Now you need to add the necessary tools to help with debugging. Depending on the package manager you found, use one of the following commands to add useful debugging tools:</p><ul><li><code>apt-get install -y curl vim procps inetutils-tools net-tools lsof</code></li><li><code>apk add curl vim procps net-tools lsof</code></li><li><code>yum install curl vim procps lsof</code></li></ul><p>At this point, it’s up to you to figure out the problem. You can edit files using vim to tweak the container until you understand what’s going on. If you forget all of the files you’ve touched on the container, you can alway kill the pod and the container will restart without your changes. Always remember to write down the steps taken to get the container working. You’ll want to use your notes to alter the Dockerfile or add commands to the container startup scripts. </p><h2 id="debugging-your-containers">Debugging Your Containers</h2><p>We have created a simple script to get all of the debuging tools, as long as you are working with a container that has curl pre-installed:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>/bin/sh -c </span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>curl</span><span> -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/releaseapp-io/container-debug/main/install.sh</span><span>)</span><span>"</span></p></pre></div><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>In this article, we’ve learnt how to spot and investigate the CrashLoopBackOff errors in containers.

<p>Client, executives, and business owners always have one question at the start of a software project:</p>



<h4><em>“When will it be done?”</em><em></em></h4>



<p>If you’ve been working in software development for more than a month, you know this question is a trap.</p>



<p>Software development isn’t an assembly line where each task is measured down to the second. You’re creating a product that’s literally never existed before. There will always be uncertainty about the timeline.</p>



<p>Even so, software development is a business, so we have to accommodate the people we build software for.</p>



<p>They need the best estimate we can give them, and we need to avoid promising something we can’t deliver.</p>



<p>Which brings me to the focus of this article:</p>



<h4><em>How can I create an estimated timeline that my stakeholders will accept—but won’t lead to unrealistic deadlines for me and my team?</em><em></em></h4>



<h2>Ideal Days vs. Story Points: Two Common Methods</h2>



<p>GRAPHIC</p>



<p>In the quest to create better project estimates, developers have come up with all kinds of systems.</p>



<p>Two very common ones are:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Ideal days (or similar time-based estimates)</li><li>Story points</li></ol>



<p>Both can be used to create project timelines, and both have their pros and cons.</p>



<p>One method is reliable, data-driven, and stable.</p>



<p>The other?</p>



<p>You can make it work. But it’s a bit more like crossing your fingers and hoping for the best.</p>



<h2>1. Ideal Days: Advantages and Disadvantages</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1259" src="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-8-scaled.jpg" alt="Ideal Days: Advantages and Disadvantages" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-8-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-8-300x148.jpg 300w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-8-1024x504.jpg 1024w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-8-768x378.jpg 768w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-8-1536x756.jpg 1536w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-8-2048x1008.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></figure>



<p>Here’s a simple definition of for the ideal days method of estimating work:</p>



<h4><em>Ideal days is an estimate of the number of days your team would take to complete a project if they worked on nothing else and had no interruptions.</em><em></em></h4>



<p>In this context, “interruptions” means anything that causes the team to stop work on the project, including team meetings, training, other projects, illness, etc.</p>



<p>For example, a team of three developers might estimate a total of 45 ideal days to complete a project. If they had no interruptions and worked on nothing else, that would be an estimated timeline of 15 days.</p>



<p>No team exists without at least <em>some</em>&nbsp;interruptions.</p>



<p>For that reason, many teams might estimate somewhere between 20 and 30 days in this situation, depending on how optimistic (or realistic) they are.</p>



<h3>Pros of Ideal Days</h3>



<p>There are two main pros to the ideal days method:</p>



<ul><li>It’s concrete and intuitive</li><li>Clients and outside stakeholders understand it immediately</li></ul>



<p>When you tell a client, “this project should take 20 days,” you don’t have to educate them about the process you’re using or a new idea. They already understand the concept of time estimates expressed in hours, days, or months.</p>



<p>In most cases, clients and outside stakeholders will ask for an estimate given in days, weeks, or months—which is the main reason the ideal days method is so popular.</p>



<h3>Cons of Ideal Days</h3>



<p>There are three major problems with the ideal days method:</p>



<ul><li>Human beings are scientifically proven to be outrageously bad at estimating how long things will take;</li><li>Ideal days are often calculated based on the ideal case scenario, not a data-backed review of actual work completed on similar projects;</li><li>In practice, software teams often miss their promise date when using the ideal days method.</li></ul>



<p>This is not news to developers, of course. It’s no secret that we’re all bad at estimating time.</p>



<p>Despite these drawbacks, though, ideal days remain a popular method of estimating time. That brings us to the other most popular method: Story points.</p>



<h2>2. Story Points: Advantages and Disadvantages</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1270" src="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-scaled.jpg" alt="Story Points: Advantages and Disadvantages" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-300x149.jpg 300w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-1024x508.jpg 1024w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-768x381.jpg 768w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-1536x762.jpg 1536w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-2048x1016.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></figure>



<p>Here’s a definition of story points:</p>



<h4><em>Story points are an estimate of the effort—not time—required to complete a task within a larger project.</em><em></em></h4>



<p>As you probably know if you’re reading this article, the term “story points” comes from the idea of user stories, a key idea within Scrum and Agile project management methodologies.</p>



<p>If you’re creating a new report for small business owners, for example, your user story might say:</p>



<p><em>As a small business owner, I want a daily report of my revenue for the previous day.</em><em></em></p>



<p>Story points are the estimates of the effort it will take to build all the features needed to create the experience described in the user story.</p>



<h3>Story Points Use a Relative Scale</h3>



<p>Story points are often assigned using the Fibonacci numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc.) or some other relative scale.</p>



<p>We may not know <em>exactly</em>&nbsp;how big a task is, but we know that changing a background from blue to green might be a 1 while building a new drop-down menu might be a 3 by comparison.</p>



<h4><em>Importantly, you should </em><em>never, ever</em><em>&nbsp;mix story points with ideal days or any other time-based estimation method. That includes the common practice of pegging story points to a certain number of hours or days (e.g., “One story point = one day”).</em><em></em></h4>



<p>Doing so strips your team of the most powerful reason to use story points—increasing your velocity.</p>



<h2>Pros of Story Points</h2>



<p>High-performance software teams don’t operate at one speed.</p>



<p>Instead, as they work their way through a project, they find ways to do it better, faster, and with less waste.</p>



<p>That means two vitally important things for your team:</p>



<ul><li>After you’ve been through three sprints, you will have a <em>very</em>&nbsp;strong understanding of how fast the team is moving—its velocity;</li><li>The velocity will increase over time as the team finds new ways to complete the work faster and with less waste.</li></ul>



<p>For example, it may take your team five days to complete the first 100 points of a project.</p>



<p>If so, your <em>velocity</em>&nbsp;over that first week is 100.</p>



<h3>Story Points Example Estimate</h3>



<p>Say you’re using one-week sprints for a 1,000 point project.</p>



<p>After three sprints, the team completes 104, 109, and 117 story points, respectively.</p>



<p>That’s an average velocity of 110, which is very strong evidence of the team’s capacity for this particular project <em>even with</em>&nbsp;normal interruptions. This is in stark contrast to the ideal days method, which assumes no interruptions and no other priorities.</p>



<p>You can now go to your stakeholders and confidently report that the 1,000 point project should be complete in a total of nine weeks.</p>



<p>If your team is increasing its velocity as it works (as it should!) there is a very good chance you’ll be able to deliver the project <em>ahead</em>&nbsp;of your promised delivery date.</p>



<h2>The Cons of Story Points</h2>



<p>While story points have many advantages, there are a few downsides, including:</p>



<ul><li>Story points are abstract and difficult to understand;</li><li>You might not be able to make a good timeline estimate right at the outset of a new project;</li><li>You’ll have to work hard to educate clients about the method and communicate with them often about the team’s progress.</li></ul>



<p>The abstract nature of story points means you’ll have to work much harder at communicating with clients, executives, and outside stakeholders.</p>



<p>At the beginning of the project, they’ll want you to tell them <em>exactly</em>&nbsp;how long the project will take—along with how much it will cost.</p>



<p>And in truth, you won’t <em>really</em>&nbsp;have an accurate estimate for them. It will be three sprints before you have an accurate velocity number you can use to make a data-backed projection.</p>



<p>For that reason, your initial estimates will be more uncertain than your estimates once you get the team moving.</p>



<p>That issue will be a point of concern for many clients, salespeople, or executives. They’ll want a firm timeline <em>before</em>&nbsp;they approve the project.</p>



<p>Luckily, there’s a straightforward way to create high-quality initial estimates even before you have a data-backed velocity number.</p>



<h3>How to Create an Initial Delivery Estimate Using Story Points</h3>



<p>The good news is: initial estimates using the story point method aren’t any less uncertain than the ideal days method.</p>



<p>If your team has completed similar projects to the one being proposed, review the completed sprint boards, then use the velocity the team achieved on those projects as a starting point for your estimate.</p>



<p>This lets you create realistic, data-backed estimates for the timeline of your project, ones that will get more accurate as you begin the project and start completing the work.</p>



<p>As a bonus, if you review the completed sprint boards of similar projects with your client or stakeholders as you give them your initial estimate, it will make you look like you <em>really</em>&nbsp;know what you’re doing.</p>



<p>Data-driven methods have that effect on people. 🙂</p>



<h3>Story Points Create Better Outcomes</h3>



<p>Despite its downsides, we believe story points create better outcomes for everyone involved in software development, including:</p>



<ul><li>Fewer last-minute overtime or weekend work;</li><li>More on-time projects;</li><li>Happier clients;</li><li>Happier developers;</li><li>Less overtime and write-offs—which leads to more profitable projects.</li></ul>



<h2>Use Time Tracking with Story Points for Full Visibility Within Your Sprints</h2>



<p>Story points are awesome for scoping and planning work, and velocity (once you have a real number based on at least iterations) is the most accurate way we know to calculate project timelines.</p>



<p>Together, story points and velocity are the antidote to fussy clients who want to know: “How long will this take!?”</p>



<p>Internally, however, once you’re inside a sprint, story points leave a gap in your visibility to the work being completed.</p>



<p>For example, imagine your team sets 20 points of work for a two-week sprint.</p>



<p>In Scrum, you never move a task to “complete” until it’s fully complete—ready for the user to use.</p>



<p>Five days into a ten-day sprint, you might still have 20 points remaining as “unfinished” on the sprint board.</p>



<p>You’re halfway through the sprint, but you have no information about how it’s going. You have 20 points of work remaining, but will it take five days to complete as you planned? Three days? 15 days?</p>



<p>At this point in the sprint, you have no data to make that projection.</p>



<p>It’s a bit like waking up in the morning, looking at your clock, but the only data you see is the year. It’s useful to know what year we’re in, but it doesn’t tell you if you’re running …</p></div></div>

<p>The early 1990s were a great time to be a kid. There was the ever present threat of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_close_calls">nuclear annihilation</a>, we were constantly being reminded that <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094291/">Greed was Good</a>, and it marked the advent of truly portable computing.</p>

<p>Sure, laptops had been <a href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/03/08/the-1978-xerox-notetaker-the-first-computer-to-be-used-on-a-commercial-flight-xerox-vintagecomputing-history/">available for a while by that point</a> - albeit at a price which would financial cripple small countries - but the first part of the final decade of the 20th century saw the arrival of computing devices which would actually fit in your pocket.</p>

<p>There was a kid in every school whose Dad had been given one by his work, decided it was too complex, and who <em>palm</em>ed it off to their offspring in the misguided belief it would help them organise their busy juvenile lives.</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_Series_3">Psion 3</a> had a keyboard and a screen. It had an address book, database software, contact managers, calculators, agendas, and world clocks - everything the high-powered 80's corporate executive could ever need to organise his high-powered 80s executive life.</p>

<p>To adolescents in the schoolyard, it had limited practical utility beyond being cool as hell - it could be flipped shut, and it could fit in your pocket.
</p>
<p>
Granted, owning one of these bad boys would not grant an amazing degree of popularity to the possessor, and the technological gap between the home and office computers of the day and the popular palmtops, meant that it would only ever be of limited utility.
</p>

<p>Regardless, the palmtop computers were so cool as to be ice cold, and I have long wanted one which could be genuinely useful, fill the gaps left wide open by even the best mobile phones, and perform as well as a desktop PC. I wanted a   <a href="https://cyberdeck.cafe/">cyberdeck.</a></p>

<p>This led to a spree of purchases of Linux-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netbook">netbooks</a> and EeePCs in the early to mid 2000s - all of which were abandoned as underpowered, locked-down limited-use-case wastes of money not long after.</p>

<table>

<p>The dream of a cyberdeck died - or at least fell into a coma - until the Raspberry Pi came on the scene.</p>

<p>It was ultra-low power, tolerable performance, and cheap as chips. Pi-based Cyberdecks began appearing on reddit in the (incredibly long) run-up to the release of CDPR's <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>.</p>
<p>I even made my <a href="https://www.cyberpunks.com/super-simple-dirt-cheap-diy-portable-raspberry-pi-laptop/">own, super cheap, super low-tech version</a> which was published on another site.</p>

</tbody></table>

<p>But the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Pi</a>, excellent though it is, is a little <em>too</em> low powered to be used as a daily driver. Yes, you can use it as your main machine, but you’ll soon feel that it’s lacking… something.</p>

<p>And so, up until yesterday, I was using a 14” Dell E7470 for my everyday work and play, and carrying a Linux powered Oneplus 3 as my phone and for my mobile computing needs. The Oneplus, running <a href="https://www.ubports.com/">Ubuntu Touch</a> is great if privacy is your main concern, but as pocket sized computing platform, it’s just not there.</p>

<p>And then yesterday morning I smashed the screen of my Dell. Disaster! I write for a living, I work from home and I have deadlines. The repair is going to cost around 80 quid if I do it myself, and I would be offline for over a week. If a similar disaster occurred under normal circumstances, I’d work from the local library, but due to the current pandemic, that isn’t really an option.</p>

<p>Chinese hardware company GPD advertises the <a href="https://amzn.to/3iOQEoH">P2 Max</a> as “The world’s smallest Ultrabook,” and it is. There was also one for sale less than a mile away from me.</p>

<p>Money changed hands (at a suitable social distance), and I took my new purchase home with me.</p>

<h4> What's in the box?</h4>

<p>It’s a hella small box, and in it is a hella small, gunmetal grey laptop. It’s of comparable size to one of the palmtops of old, and I can pretty much cover the whole thing with one of my hands.</p>

<p>Open the lid, and there is a keyboard will full-sized keys. Just not very many of them.</p>

<p>There’s the usual QWERTY layout, cursors, CAPS, and numericals - but there a few noticeable absences. Only one shift, Alt and Ctrl, for instance. This isn’t a big deal as one hand can easily span the entire keyboard. There are no function keys either. The mousepad is about as small as it can be while still being usable. Again that’s OK as this tiny GPD ‘ultrabook’ comes with a 10 point touchscreen, and most of the time I use a USB optical mouse anyway.</p>

<p><img src="https://thecrow.uk/assets/gpd_P2_max_is_tiny.png" alt="Honestly, it's really small!"></p>

<p>The device is powered by a standard Type C USB of the same type I use to charge my mobile, and in return, offers two Type A USB ports (one on each side), a micro HDMI port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. It’s not the most expansive array of ports, but it keeps the size and weight down.</p>

<p>The screen itself is a work of wonder. At 8.9 inches, it can support resolutions of up to 2560 x 1600 px. That’s insane. No-one on Earth has eyesight good enough to comfortably read text that small for an extended period. Yes, it’s just about do-able, and the text itself is perfectly formed, but eyestrain will quickly become an issue. After spending an evening at 1920 x 180, I eventually set it to an easy 1440 x 900 px.</p>

<p>So, it’s a teeny tiny laptop with a great screen and a good keyboard, but is it an ultrabook?</p>

<p>GPD certainly thinks so - it’s the machine’s headline selling point. Personally, I’m not even sure what an Ultrabook even <em>is</em>, apart from being a somewhat flexible marketing term.</p>

<h4>Specs matter</h4>

<p>Earlier, I mentioned the netbooks i previously owned. They failed as proto-cyberdecks because they were just not up to the task of everyday computing. They weren’t even really up to the task of basic web browsing.</p>

<p>The GPD P2 Max is different. The model I now own came with a 512GB SSD, and a solid 16GB of DDR4 RAM. That’s pretty solid. The processor is an eighth gen Intel. On paper at least, it’s similar to my currently unwell Dell.</p>

<p>Windows 10 Home edition booted to desktop in a few seconds -long enough for me to verify the specs before installing my OS of choice.</p>

<p>The Ubuntu Linux install took around 10 minutes, and i3 wnt quickly on top of that. I was able to retrieve the conf files from my old machine over SSH, and just like that, I was home.</p>

<p>Yes, it took a few minutes to get used to the keyboard, and I kept banging my fingers into the touchscreen and acidentally stealing focus, but meh. A person gets used to these things.</p>

<h4>Performance</h4>

<p>The best way of judging the performance is to tell you exactly how I’m using the machine at the moment, and how I’ve used it in the single day since it’s been in my house.</p>

<p>Right now, I’m writing this article in Atom on Workspace 5.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>On workspace 1, I have three XFCE terminals open - running Bashtop, TaskWarrior, and an SSH to my Pi which is tailing my access logs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace two has a Firefox window with 27 open tabs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace three has another Firefox window with a dozen or so tabs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(Workspaces one, two and three open automatically with their contents intact on boot.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace four has an incognito Firefox window, in which I’m doing research I probably won’t want to reference again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace six is running a <a href="https://thecrow.uk/why-does-this-site-look-like-crap-getting-used-to-life-with-jekyll/">Jekyll</a> local server in a terminal, automatically updating the preview of this article on workspace four.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace seven is running a script which periodically checks for comments on this blog and brings them to my attention.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Workspace eight, I have <a href="https://thecrow.uk/freelancing-in-a-time-of-quarantine-and-why-rss-is-the-greatest/">QuiteRSS</a>, checking for writing jobs on my behalf.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In workspace nine, I’m conducting a war of attrition against Matthias Corvinus of the Hungarian Empire in <em>Civilization VI</em>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Is the GPD P2 Max capable? Hell yes. I’m using it exactly how I used my old laptop. I’ve been playing games through Steam. I’ve been  Windows games using WINE. I’ve been productive and I’ve been having fun.</p>

<p>And when I’ve finished, I can pick it up and put it in my pocket. Even better, the screen is covered with Gorilla Glass 4, so the accident which happened to my Dell can never happen again.</p>

<p>It’s a cyberdeck.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>We have written a lot about the blind spot the US venture ecosystem has for <a href="https://digitstodollars.com/2019/09/30/3042/">semiconductors</a> (<a href="https://digitstodollars.com/2020/08/10/not-a-drop-for-you/">and here</a>) and hardware more generally. We recently helped a venture firm conduct due diligence on an electronics company, which put us in the awkward position of having to walk in someone else’s shoes. Sympathy for the devil, and all that. In our posts we have attempted to be fair, pointing out that US VCs are making sensible economic decisions albeit on a short-sighted viewpoint. Investing in hardware is much more capital intensive and thus risky than investing in software. In this post, we want to work through some of the math behind that. </p>



<p>Let’s say we have a company, Unicorn Electronics, that wants to build The SmartHorn <sup>TM</sup>, a device that magically solves customers’ problems perfectly. How do we get the company to “escape velocity” – positive cashflow sufficient to fund the company’s immediate growth needs?</p>



<p>First, Unicorn needs to design the Horn. Depending on how complex the device is this can cost anywhere from $100,000 to $1 million, from a third party design shop. Some people can do this design themselves, others are going to need outside help. For our purposes, let’s say the Horn design costs $500,000. This amount gets the company the “blueprints” and a few prototypes.  </p>



<p>But most devices today are fairly complex. Even if the hard computation is done in the cloud or in the app, the device itself needs to be able to function, to be programmed and to communicate with the Internet. That means firmware. This is low-level software, and not only is their no standard “firmware” programming language or operating system, pretty much every chip company has its own instruction language. Hiring firmware engineers is not that expensive in dollars, but it can be very expensive in time. Here’s a typical scenario. The design shop hands the firmware designers some prototypes. The firmware team finds a bug that requires a new wire or capacitor. So the design firm has to build (by hand) a new prototype. The firmware team then finds that two of the chips are not speaking to each other – the Bluetooth and the temperature sensor for instance. Is the problem in one chip or the other or somewhere in the wiring in between? Often this will mean the design team needs to spin up yet another prototype. And since these teams are likely in different cities, if not different countries, every re-spin loses days in shipping and re-work. </p>



<p>So far, we have spent $500,000 and a month on the design, and $100,000 and four months on firmware.</p>



<p>Now we have to find a manufacturer. This company will need to create tools and molds as well as designing a manufacturing flow. They can do this fairly quickly, but as they are operating on expensive machine tools, they will have minimum quantity requirements. These can be as low as a few thousand units, but here is where the costs really start to add up. </p>



<p>Let’s say the SmartHorn costs $100 in parts and manufacturing, but the manufacturer requires a minimum of 5,000 units. Then the tricky part becomes sourcing parts. The global electronics supply chain is incredibly tight right now. <a href="https://digitstodollars.com/2020/10/27/what-is-happening-to-the-supply-chain/">We wrote about this back in October</a>, and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/business/auto-factories-semiconductor-chips.html">New York Times was catching up last week</a>. Lead times for many parts can be several months, and frustratingly it is hard to predict with often some of the lowest value parts in the shortest supply. So add $500,000 (5,000 units X $100 BOM) and four months. </p>



<p>Then we enter into a whole sea of minutiae. The device will need various certifications UL, FCC, etc. Add $50,000, but fortunately this can be done while the manufacturing is ramping up. But there are bigger costs as well such as insurance. Most distributors (i.e. retail) and enterprise customers will want the company to maintain a range of insurance policies, tack on another $50,000 or so. Then we have to factor in shipping and customs and taxes, so maybe $20 per device. </p>



<p>Next up, the company has to factor in warranties and returns. The accountants have requirements for setting reserves for these, but a rough rule of thumb (sufficient for our purposes here only) is 10% of the costs of the materials needs to be set aside to cover the cost of returns and replacements. </p>



<p>Finally, the company has to contend with marketing. This amount can range from nothing to A Lot, depending on whether they are selling to consumers or to a single large enterprise customer. A basic PR budget and some content marketing runs about $50,000, plus or minus. </p>



<p>Adding this up we have the following budget:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Item</td><td>Amount</td><td data-align="center">Time</td></tr><tr><td>Design</td><td>$500,000</td><td data-align="center">1 Month</td></tr><tr><td>Firmware</td><td>$100,000</td><td data-align="center">4 Months</td></tr><tr><td>Manufacture</td><td>$500,000</td><td data-align="center">4 Months</td></tr><tr><td>Certification</td><td>$50,000</td><td data-align="center"></td></tr><tr><td>Insurance</td><td>$50,000</td><td data-align="center"></td></tr><tr><td>Shipping </td><td>$100,000</td><td data-align="center">1 Month</td></tr><tr><td>Marketing</td><td>$50,000</td><td data-align="center"></td></tr><tr><td>Sub-total Cost of Goods Sold</td><td>$1,350,000</td><td data-align="center"></td></tr><tr><td>Warranty Reserve</td><td>$135,000</td><td data-align="center"></td></tr><tr><td><strong>TOTAL</strong></td><td><strong>$1,485,000</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>9 Months</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>All of this has to take place before the company can collect any revenue, unless they have done some form of crowdsourcing. So just to break even the company has to charge $297/unit, and to get a 50% gross margin the retail price would need to be $594. </p>



<p>We also need to factor in software costs. For this example, we will assume Unicorn Electronics does their own app and back-end software. The company could probably build all of the hardware and software with a team of ten people. If the average salary is $150,000 year (assume some expensive onshore talent and some less expensive offshore talent), the total comes out to $1.5 million for a year. </p>



<p>So $1.485 million in hardware costs and $1.5 million for headcount, for a total of $2.985 million. The company then sells 5,000 units for $594 a piece or $2.97 million in revenue and yielding a net <em><strong>loss</strong></em> of ($15,000). Hardware can be dispiriting.</p>



<p>The good news is that there is a heavy fixed costs component to this model, so tweaking a few variables can have a big impact. For instance, if they raise prices by $6/unit to an even $600, the net profit goes to $15,000 (positive). Sell an additional 1,000 units and the net profits are close to half a million dollars. If they sell 100,000 units then the company has a path to becoming a true Unicorn. There is a lot of leverage in the model, which is why people keep trying to build hardware. </p>



<p>That being said, the realities of hardware can be daunting. Take the $3 million the company needs to get a product out the door, a similarly sized team could build a software application that can potentially grow much faster and they would still have a million dollars to do customer acquisition. Compounding this, the software would come with a recurring revenue stream. The trouble with hardware is that for the company to grow, they have to come out with the Smart Horn 2 and the Smart Horn 3, and go through all of the above again, and again. </p>



<p>Hardware has immense financial leverage, but the upfront costs and more crucially the time required are daunting. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><figure><div></div></figure><section><div itemprop="articleBody"><p><a href="https://rudderstack.com/blog/the-complete-customer-data-stack/">Your data warehouse is the platform your customer data stack is built on</a>. It acts as a robust central system for driving critical business decisions while maintaining a unified source of truth for your entire organization. Businesses are constantly looking to improve their product or marketing strategies to get an extra edge over their competitors. Data warehouses help you get that competitive edge by serving analytical data to make fact-based decisions that drive innovation and business growth. While teams turn those analysis-driven insights into strategies and tactics, it’s tough to activate the warehouse’s actual data that the insights are based on.</p>
<p>To make it easier to utilize and activate all of the analytics your teams build, we’re launching a new feature called RudderStack Warehouse Actions. Warehouse Actions enables you to leverage processed customer data stored in your data warehouse and directly route this enriched information to your entire customer data stack.</p>
<p>In this post, we detail Warehouse Actions. We explain how configuring your warehouse as a data source can fully unlock your data’s value, how Warehouse Actions works, some of its benefits, and how to set it up in RudderStack.</p>
<div> <p> <iframe title="" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iafB9gyoWtc?rel=0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p> </div>
<h2>Why Warehouse Actions?</h2>
<p>Data warehouses are an indispensable tool as they enable decision-makers to access data quickly through business intelligence tools, SQL clients, and other analytical applications. Without a data warehouse in place, you are forced to rely on the individual (siloed) applications you use and the raw data from each for analysis. </p>
<p>A warehouse helps guarantee that your data is unified, consistent, and high-quality by eliminating duplicate records, errors, and inconsistent information. It also enables your teams to perform deep analysis and modeling on your data, something that is nearly impossible without a warehouse.  Given the quality of the data in your warehouse and your teams’ can derive from it, it makes sense to use the customer data in your warehouse to activate your customer tools. </p>
<p>Warehouse Actions makes feeding customer insights into your customer data pipelines easy by turning tables into event streams that can trigger activation in your downstream customer tools. </p>

<p>RudderStack makes it easy to collect data from different sources, event and non-event, and securely ingest them into your warehouse. Once data is successfully ingested, your teams can then apply advanced queries or models to generate valuable data composites (either tables or views) that are frequently materialized (aka written) as their tables and stored in your data warehouse. For example, <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/">dbt</a> can be used to transform data within your warehouses by simply writing select statements. dbt turns these select statements into tables and views.</p>
<p>With Warehouse Actions, any updates to the analytics-derived datasets that live in your warehouse can be collected by RudderStack and pushed as events to all of your customer tools.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Using a Warehouse Actions</h2>
<p>Even if collected and unified across multiple touchpoints, customer event data may lack the necessary information to build complete or enriched customer profiles. Event data alone doesn’t give context into any of the information stored in your customer master data, campaign data, or even your advertising data. When you have data from sources beyond events that could make your customer profiles better or enable deeper, more meaningful analysis, you need a data warehouse. Your warehouse is where you can combine all of these different types of customer data to define better customer profiles and derive more meaningful insights from more in-depth analysis. With Warehouse Actions, you can route the customer insights in your data warehouse to third-party tools for further activation. </p>
<p>For example, when running a new marketing campaign, you are often challenged with gathering the “right data” for personalized emails,  push notifications, or targeted audiences. This “right data” often starts with simple data, such as name and email address, and then expands to complex customer data, including behavioral traits, products viewed, subscriptions enrolled, and so on. All of the data you need to make the “right data” is either already in your data warehouse or easily could be. </p>
<p>Warehouse Actions lets you action on the “right data”, routing the outputs of your team’s analysis to all of your customer tools. As a result, it is significantly easier to help your marketing teams build and automate things like customized recommendations for campaigns. Also, it allows your product team to build win-back flows for users likely to churn. </p>

<p>We will use a real-world example to walk through how to set up Warehouse Actions. Let’s say your company wants to use the number of log-ins over seven days to calculate a lead score for new users. Multiple log-ins will increase the lead score. </p>
<p>Let’s also say that because you use RudderStack Event Stream and RudderStack Cloud Extract, you have the log-in event data from your website, iOS app, and Android app, as well as the lead records from Salesforce in your warehouse. You can use SQL (or another method of querying the data) to build a simple model for calculating each lead score. The result is a table in your warehouse that lists Salesforce leads and their associated score. </p>
<p>In Snowflake, the query to calculate lead score and produce a table might look something like this: </p>

<p>With Warehouse Actions, you can easily pull the updated lead profiles from the table in Snowflake back through RudderStack and send them to Salesforce, meaning your sales team will have the most up-to-date status on new signups. Because the table is translated into an event stream, you can also route it to any other tools that need the lead score, like marketing automation and customer experience platforms. </p>
<p>Configuring Warehouse Actions is simple and only takes a few minutes.</p>

<h2>Pachyderm Uses Warehouse Actions to Automate Their Onboarding E-mails</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.pachyderm.com/">Pachyderm</a>, an enterprise-grade, open-source data science platform, implemented Warehouse Actions for lead qualification. After creating an account, the first action Pachyderm wants their customers to do is create a workspace. They encourage users to do this in a series of drip emails sent through <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/">HubSpot</a>, but they don’t want these drip emails to go out to customers that have already created a workspace. This data is already in their data warehouse, and now, with Warehouse Actions, they can automatically exclude these customers from this drip email series.</p>

    <p>2021-01-26 08:59:23+00:00</p>
    <p><a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/">Wayland</a> is the “new” (13 years old already) display server technology on Linux, which is supposed to replace
the antiquated X11. It promises better security, performance, portability, everything, compared to X11, and
it sure does deliver, provided that you’re not using <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/">unsupported graphics cards</a>.
You can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIctzAQOe44">this talk / rant about X11</a> to get an idea about how bad it is.</p>

<p>Some power users also haven’t switched to Wayland because their window manager doesn’t have a
Wayland equivalent (XMonad, Awesome, Bspwm and the others, all having their unique feature-set). Some may wonder “hmm maybe I can port it myself”. I wrote this post to make you (re)consider that.</p>

<p>One of the main ideas of Wayland is that it’s merely a specialised IPC protocol, and the communication is
strictly between the clients (applications on your screen mainly) and the server.</p>

<p>The server is what we are interested in now. Unlike X11, where the server is X.Org and the window manager
is just an X11 client with special privileges, on Wayland the window manager is also a server and a compositor. In fact, the correct terminology is “Wayland compositor”. This piece of software has the
task of doing everything it wants with the clients, which is usually among the lines of showing them
on the screen and giving them inputs events from your keyboards, mice, touchscreens etc. In fact, <a href="https://mir-server.io/">no one
stops you from leaving window management as an API</a>.</p>

<p>On my laptop, I prefer using GNOME under Wayland, because it has the most stable, fully-featured and “just works”
experience there is. However, I wanted a better way of organising windows on my screen than leaving them
shuffled around. Tiling was also not good, because every time you launch a new window, the others get
shrunk to fit, which is not good on a small laptop display.</p>

<p>Luckily I discovered <a href="https://github.com/paperwm/PaperWM">PaperWM</a>. It’s perfect for laptops, instead of
shrinking your windows, it just renders them off-screen. To switch between one or the other you can just
flick three fingers on the touchpad. It’s great. It’s also “glossy” and polished and has great UI and animations.</p>

<p>It has some disadvantages though, mainly concerning its speed. I find it sluggish, and it’s no surprise that
like all other GNOME Shell extensions, it’s a JavaScript behemoth. PaperWM still uses the GNOME Tweener
framework for its animations, which is entirely written in JS. Because of that, it needs to communicate with the main
GNOME compositor process on each operation. And because we’re talking animations, said operations happen
for <em>every frame</em>. That means there is JS executed for every frame, 60 times a second. It’s horrible!</p>

<p>BTW nowadays GNOME uses animations implemented in C (since GNOME 3.34), the “GNOME runs JS on every frame” statement is for the most part false today.</p>

<p>Because of the inefficiency of PaperWM, it also means that it drains my battery quickly, which is bad for a laptop!</p>

<p>So, because I am a student with a lot of free time, together with <a href="https://alexge50.com/">Alex</a> we figured we shall develop a scrollable tiling (PaperWM-like) Wayland compositor. It’s called <a href="https://gitlab.com/cardboardwm/cardboard">Cardboard</a> (get it??). It also has the nicety of
being controlled and configured by a remote control program, like bspwm.
Neither Alex nor I had experience with any kind of Wayland development. However, I wrote <a href="https://tudorr.ro/software/windowchef/">an X11 window manager</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/tudurom/disputils/">some XRandR querying utilities</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tudurom/ruler">a window rule daemon</a>. Alex has experience
with <a href="https://git.alexge50.com/a/gie">graphics programming</a> and <a href="https://github.com/alexge50/libwatchpoint">C++ devilry</a>.</p>

<p>Our “tech stack” was <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots">wlroots</a>, which is an exceptional Wayland compositor library (apart from its lack of documentation). The description from the README is spot on:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>About 50,000 lines of code you were going to write anyway.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I (because I wrote most of the Wayland-interfacing code) realised soon that there is still a lot of boilerplate involved in writing a compositor, much more than for an X11 window manager,
namely setting up your own rendering code, registering and storing input devices and screens in your own data structures, passing input events to windows, calculating bounds for bars
and other overlays (courtesy of <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlr-protocols/blob/master/unstable/wlr-layer-shell-unstable-v1.xml"><code>layer-shell</code></a>) and others. X11 handles all of this for you,
the window manager just reacts to events regarding window inputs to establish its behaviour. With Wayland, you handle everything, even with wlroots. The upside is that if you don’t like the way X11 does something
(which is a given), not only that you can do it in your own way on Wayland, you are required to do so.</p>

<p>Because we weren’t really prepared for what writing a compositor involved, we thought that it must be approached like a “normal” program: split code into modules, each with their own responsibilities, call wlroots to do its thing, the usual stuff.
We are writing a program in our way and wlroots lets us “interface with Wayland”. Or so we thought.</p>

<p>We were as careful as possible to separate responsibilities into different structures / classes, yet we ended up with most functions taking a pointer to <code>Server</code> as their first parameter.
<code>Server</code> is a singleton holding all the other “sub-modules” in it. It represents the compositor itself. The reason most functions need <code>Server</code> is that everything is related to everything,
not because of a mistake in structuring the code, but by design. This is what a compositor requires, the problem of writing a compositor is somewhat complex because it has a great deal variables ranging
from input events, drawing on the screen, creating behaviours that the user leverages, reacting to application events. All of them can affect the other, you can not separate the thing into modules.
The best you can do is separate the code in different files and folders based on some criteria, like grouping data structures with related routines.</p>

<p>As an example, let’s take damage tracking. For starters, because the compositor is also tasked with rendering the content and displaying it on the screen, we have some rendering code that runs on every frame.
Damage tracking is tracking which areas of the screen have changed in an amount of time. An example would
be typing a letter in the terminal. The place where the cursor is changes to the letter you typed, and the cursor advances.
If there is no change, the frame is not rendered, as it would look
exactly the same as the previous one, which would be a waste of processor time.
This way, instead of re-rendering everything 60 times a second (I assume that you use a common display), we can render and paint as little as possible to account for the changed region.
You can read <a href="https://emersion.fr/blog/2019/intro-to-damage-tracking/">an introduction to damage tracking</a> written by one of the main developers of wlroots.</p>

<p>I have just implemented the most basic form of damage tracking: do not render the frame if nothing on the screen changes.
It doesn’t track the damage itself, just that it exists.
To do this, I first added a <code>wlr_output_damage</code> object to my <code>Output</code> structure:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct Output {
</span>    struct wlr_output* wlr_output;
    struct wlr_output_damage* wlr_output_damage;
<span>+   struct wlr_box usable_area;
</span>    ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This structure tracks the damage accumulated per-output, as rendering is also per-output (this means that you can use screens of different refresh rates, yay!). However, to make this initial attempt at
damage tracking easier, I decided to trigger rendering for all attached outputs. I added a <code>set_dirty()</code> function to the <code>OutputManager</code> class that does just that:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>OutputManager</span><span>::</span><span>set_dirty</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>auto</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>output</span> <span>:</span> <span>outputs</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>wlr_output_damage_add_whole</span><span>(</span><span>output</span><span>.</span><span>wlr_output_damage</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This marks every output as entirely damaged, and as such triggers a render.</p>

<p>With this function set into place, I had to identify when does the “screen” change, namely when a window “commits” (changes its contents) and when a window is moved. The window move is one example
of the way everything is related to everything in the …</p></article></div>

    <p>You may have heard that TypeScript has been taking the web development space by storm in the <a href="https://2018.stateofjs.com/javascript-flavors/typescript/">last</a> <a href="https://2019.stateofjs.com/javascript-flavors/typescript/">few</a> <a href="https://2020.stateofjs.com/en-US/technologies/javascript-flavors/">years</a>, bringing to it static types. I believe the same thing is starting to happen in the world of Python, where type checkers like <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a>,  <a href="https://pyre-check.org/">Pyre</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/pyright">Pyright</a> are increasingly used, at least where Python is used by companies to write large systems.</p>

<p>For the last several releases of Python, there have been an increasing number of type checking features added to each release by various PEPs:</p>




<p>The traffic on <a href="https://mail.python.org/archives/list/typing-sig@python.org/">typing-sig</a>, the mailing list where most major new typing features are proposed and designed, has also been seeing increasing traffic year over year.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I personally have found type checking to be very useful when working on large Python applications<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. It helps me find numerous small errors that are introduced during regular development<!-- such as import errors-->. Sure, most of these errors would be caught by the automated tests that I write for each new feature anyway<!-- TODO: footnote+link to TDD or similar practice? -->, but the type checker can find a whole bunch of errors all at once without even running the program, which decreases cycle times when adding new features:</p>

<p>Without type checking I tend to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write a bunch of new code.</li>
<li><strong>Repeat 4-6 times, in rapid succession:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Run program to manually test.</li>
<li>Find basic error (like a missing import).</li>
<li>Fix basic error.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Debug/fix deeper errors in the new code.</li>
</ul>


<p>But <em>with</em> type checking I can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write a bunch of new code.</li>
<li><strong>Run the type checker. Get a report of 4-6 basic errors. Fix basic errors immediately.</strong></li>
<li>Debug/fix deeper errors in the new code.</li>
</ul>


<p>I appreciate this increased productivity that type checking gives me when working on large programs. And I hope that more Python users try type checking for themselves, especially as Python gains an increasing number of related features in recent releases. It’s an exciting time to be a Python developer!</p>

Definitely!</p><p>Rust has multiple extremely fast web frameworks – Rocket, Actix Web, and Yew – and you can use the one that matches your needs and preferences.</p><h3 id="rocket">Rocket</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket">Rocket</a> is the most accessible web framework in the Rust ecosystem for beginners. It is highly customizable and helps you kickstart a new application quickly. At the same time, it avoids a lot of unnecessary boilerplate. Rocket also has many features included, which means that you won’t need to go far from the framework to build everything you need.</p><p>In contrast to Actix Web, the framework runs on nightly Rust – the “experimental” version of the language.</p><h3 id="actix-web">Actix Web</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/actix/actix-web">Actix Web</a> is usually thought to be more performant and stable than Rocket. Underneath, it works with the actor model used in <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/introduction-to-erlang#process-oriented">Erlang</a> and <a href="https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/actors.html">Akka</a>.</p><p>In contrast to Rocket, it’s less “batteries included”, meaning that you will most likely need to use third-party libraries for extra functionality.</p><h3 id="yew">Yew</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/yewstack/yew">Yew</a> is a Rust framework for creating web apps with WebAssembly. Among its main benefits, it lists a component-based framework like in React and Elm, outstanding performance because of the multi-thread support, and JavaScript interoperability.</p><p>As of now, it is not production-ready but should be an excellent choice for side projects and internal tooling, especially if you want to work with WASM.</p><h3 id="zola">Zola</h3><p>If you need something quick and simple to serve a static website, <a href="https://github.com/getzola/zola">Zola</a> is a fantastic tool to create fast and scalable web pages without any other dependencies or JS bloat.</p><h3 id="warp">Warp</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp">Warp</a> is a web server framework written in Rust. In comparison to Rocket and Actix, it is rather slim for a web framework and will provide you only with basic functionality out of the box.</p><h2 id="game-development">Game development</h2><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/cu/cubf89sc.2_(36)_(1).jpg" alt="Rust game development" loading="lazy"></p><p>Rust is exceptional for game development for the same reason that C++ is: it is predictably performant. Here are some of the engines you can use to build your own Rust game.</p><h3 id="bevy">Bevy</h3><p>Two of the main Rust game engines are Bevy and Amethyst. Among them, <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy">Bevy</a> is the newer and cooler one. It is a simple, data-driven engine and can essentially be called Amethyst 2.0 since it is heavily inspired by it.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qjc0V58lB7A" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>For more info on Bevy, you can check out the <a href="https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/introduction/">Bevy book</a>.</p><h3 id="amethyst">Amethyst</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst">Amethyst</a> is the more mature one of the two and, because of that, has more features that you might need for a large-scale project and better integrations with 3rd party libraries. But, Bevy is catching up fast. If you are searching for an engine for your new project, I’d recommend looking at them both and seeing which one you like better.</p><h3 id="ggez">ggez</h3><p>If you are searching for something simple to start off, <a href="https://github.com/ggez/ggez">ggez</a> is a lightweight cross-platform game framework for making 2D games with minimal friction.</p><hr><p>If you want to read more on game development in Rust, check out <a href="https://arewegameyet.rs/">Are we game yet?</a></p><h2 id="operating-systems">Operating systems</h2><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/zd/zdu35vif.3_(34)_(1).jpg" alt="Rust operating systems" loading="lazy"></p><p>Rust is an excellent alternative to C in operating system development since it offers the same level of performance while taking care of memory safety.

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1607550167012_219370"><div><p>Today a lot of valuable digital construction data (BIM data and beyond) is locked up in closed proprietary data formats which are bound to aging software packages developed by a single software vendor. As a result, stakeholders in the construction process (e.g. contractors, sub-contractors, estimators, specification writers, owners, facility managers, etc.) are unable to fully leverage the BIM data to make better decisions or optimize their processes. Some of the negative results are miscommunication and misunderstanding between stakeholders, inaccurate estimation, change orders, scheduling and planning conflicts, errors in constructability, and so on.</p><p>Two decades ago, it was common practice for data formats to be only read and written by a single piece of software, on a single platform. This is no longer adequate.</p><p>As the internet has grown in importance, and as computing devices have become more specialized, well-designed open data exchange formats such as PDF, HTML, JPEG, MP3, MP4, and XML have become crucial to the effective exchange of data.</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1607550167012_228680"><div><p>So what is an open format, why is it good for the construction industry? First, according to Wikipedia:</p><blockquote><p><em>An open format is a file format for storing digital data, defined by a published specification usually maintained by a standards organization, and which can be used and implemented by anyone. For example, an open format can be implemented by both proprietary and free and open-source software, using the typical software licenses used by each. In contrast to open formats, closed formats are considered trade secrets.</em></p></blockquote></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606975570419_24188"><p><h3>Open Formats are Good for Customers</h3></p></div></div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1607435564498_23818"><div><p><em>As a customer, it is risky to build a dependency on technology based on a single vendor’s closed format. </em>Users place themselves entirely at the mercy of one business: their pricing, tooling, and support. This has proven to be a real problem for customers that have their data locked up behind a walled garden that they must pay exorbitant amounts of money to have limited access to it.</p><p>This is a relic of an older business model from the time when most computing was done in isolation on a single machine.

We carefully evaluated many different file formats before starting our journey. The four primary contenders for 3D BIM interchange into real-time which we evaluated were: FBX, glTF, USD, and IFC.</h3></p></div></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606976253291_13454"><p><a href="https://help.autodesk.com/view/FBX/2020/ENU/%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0"><strong>FBX</strong></a><strong> (FilmBox File Format)</strong> is a widely used file format originally from Kaydara and is now owned and maintained by Autodesk. It has become the default asset transmission format in the games industry. Even though FBX has a free SDK, it is not open format. Reading and writing FBX files requires the binary SDK and it cannot be ported to web-browsers. FBX was originally designed for animation data. It does not do a good job of conveying the semantics of BIM data and is inefficient at handling large geometry.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606976375619_14778"><p><a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/specification/2.0"><strong>glTF</strong></a><strong> (GL Transmission Format)</strong> is an open data exchange format for 3D geometry and animation data that was designed specifically for WebGL. The glTF format is a difficult specification to fully support (for reading and writing) and requires custom extensions to support BIM data and geometry data channels beyond a limited initial set.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606976477826_42054"><p><a href="https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/docs/index.html%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0"><strong>USD</strong></a><strong> (Universal Scene Description)</strong> is a framework for authoring and rendering 3D scenes composed from multiple sources.

IFC was started in 1994 by a consortium of 12 companies led by <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/">Autodesk</a>.</p><p>IFC was designed to express parametric surfaces and solids and their associated BIM data. This means that to make a rendering, the parametric surfaces and solids must go through a very lengthy conversion process into a triangular representation appropriate for rendering by the GPU (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit">Graphical Processing Unit</a>). The GPU specializes in drawing lists of triangles very quickly. The conversion of a parametric surface to a triangular format is called “triangulation” or “tessellation”.</p><p>The process of triangulating complex intersecting parametric surfaces is very time consuming for a computer, and hard to do correctly. It requires a specialized library, called a geometry kernel. With the goal of reducing the time required to display the geometry, this made IFC unacceptably inefficient for us.</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606976621178_36617"><p><h3>Our Findings Left Us Searching for More Answers</h3></p></div></div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606976943187_17825"><p>We found that these formats required too much complexity to parse large scale BIM projects correctly and efficiently on low-power devices, and they had no built-in mechanism to carry the structured BIM data.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remote work is trending. But the remote revolution started long before the pandemic and will stay powerful even after the hype subsides. As with any change, how well you adapt and improve will determine whether you get the better of remote work or run back to offices once the external factors go away.</p> <p>I decided to go remote 3 years ago and I'm glad I did. My last workplace was BriteCore, a remote-first company based in the US. And tomorrow, I'll be joining Doist, a pioneer in the world of remote work. I have gone through a lot of interview processes in the recent years.</p> <p>This article is an attempt to answer the why, what and how of remote work. The intended primary audience are developers from developing countries like me (I'm from Bangladesh) who do not want to relocate right now but wants to work on exciting products and teams all over the world. The general ideas apply to all professions that can be carried out remotely and to professionals anywhere in the world.</p> <h2 id="why-remote"> Why Remote</h2> <h3 id="better-opportunities"> Better Opportunities</h3> <p>Going remote means your employment is not limited to your physical location anymore. That opens up a world of opportunities. You can work for your dream company or with the colleagues and experts that you cherish. And all of it while staying in the place you like with the people you love. If you are the nomad type, this gives you great flexibility.</p> <h3 id="better-financial-gain"> Better Financial Gain</h3> <p>💵 Remote work opens up much better opportunities with much better compensations if you're, like me, living in a developing country. The compensations are generally much better than the local industry.</p> <p>📈 The high exchange rates between the powerful currencies and the local ones allow you to leverage the asymmetry and save much more. In fact, you can end up with a higher net savings per month than someone earning more than you in expensive places like San Francisco or London for example.</p> <p>📉 Tax rates are also generally lower and most developing countries have generous rebates if you're bringing in foreign remittance.</p> <p>✅ Even if you're living in a developed country, remote work saves you a good amount from commute, lunch and everything in between that comes with showing up in an office.</p> <h3 id="better-self-actualization"> Better Self-actualization</h3> <p>Remote work allows you to do deep work and puts you in control of your routine and interruptions. In a world of constant connectivity, the option to go deep as needed can give you an unfair advantage in knowledge based work that reward craftsmanship and superior skills. Read the interesting book titled <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deep Work by Cal Newport</a> to learn more about this.</p> <h2 id="the-remote-skillset"> The Remote Skillset</h2> <p>Remote work comes with its share of challenges. You need to adapt and overcome these challenges to thrive in a remote work environment for the long term. And the process starts with adopting the remote skillset.</p> <p>I use a handy mnemonic  to summarise the skillset essential for remote work. I call it the <strong>IBM CI</strong>. IBM, as you probably know, is the name of a famous company and CI or <em>Continuous Integration</em> is a term developers are quite familiar with.</p> <p>The mnemonic comes from <strong>I</strong>ndependence, <strong>B</strong>alance, <strong>M</strong>astery, <strong>C</strong>ommunication and <strong>I</strong>mpact. I borrowed it from <a href="https://doist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doist</a>. So, all credit goes to the awesome team there. I just came up with the mnemonic to remember it better. You can find it in any of their job descriptions. Their <a href="https://blog.doist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog</a> is chalk-full of great articles on remote work. Subscribe to the blog to get the best out of it.</p> <p>I'll only touch on two aspects that encompass everything else.</p> <p><strong>Manager of One</strong>: Going remote means you're unlikely to have colleagues by your side. If you're working from home, it can be quite a challenge to put a boundary between work and non-work time. You're in charge of yourself and your schedule. So, you need to be able to do it well if you want to succeed in remote work in the long term.</p> <p>I borrowed the term <em>Manager of One</em> from Basecamp, a pioneer and advocate of remote work. The ability to manage yourself is pivotal to a successful remote career. Read more about it on Basecamp's <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1430-hire-managers-of-one" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> on the topic.</p> <p><strong>Communication</strong>: Bulk of the communication in remote work happens in the written medium. You need to harness your ability to express your thoughts and ideas clearly in the written form to thrive in a remote setting. This is also going to be the primary mode of making connections with colleagues across the company. You don't need to become a literary genius though. Clear and concise technical writing goes a long way. <a href="https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1208930197702995968" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This tweet </a>sums up a  lot of great points.</p> <p>The tone gets lost in transmission in written medium. It's always good to pay extra attention to not come off harsh. Warm your messages with emojis 😃</p> <p>Most remote settings will have a diverse workforce. It's important that you stay sensitive to cultural diversities and refrain from saying anything that may be acceptable in your culture but not in others. Avoid using swear or curse words in all settings even if you deem it to be informal. I have had a manager in the past who would use the f-word in meetings. Please don't!</p> <p>As for technical skills, I advice to work on-site when starting out if possible. Most remote jobs expect you to do your job with minimal supervision. It's easier to find jobs and perform better when you have some experience under your belt.</p>  <p>Remote work means managing yourself well. Most of your communication will happen online and it is expected that you'll be using a lot of collaboration tools. Here are some of my suggestions to organise yourself better and produce quality output.</p> <p>📝 Use a task management tool. Put all your tasks as they pop up in your list and plan them accordingly. I use <a href="https://todoist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Todoist</a> for this but any tool that you're comfortable with works, even pen and paper.</p> <p>📓 Use an app for writing and taking notes. I prefer <a href="https://ia.net/writer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iA writer</a> for long documents and <a href="https://evernote.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evernote</a> for quick notes synced across devices. But again, anything that you're comfortable with works fine.</p> <p>🛠 Familiarise yourself with communication tools like Slack, Teams, etc if not already. Most companies use one for communication. While there's not much of a learning curve, you should at least know that they exist. Same for project management tools like Jira, Trello and so on.</p> <h2 id="shades-of-remote"> Shades of Remote</h2> <p>This section is more focused on developer jobs. Remote work can mean a lot of things for a developer. It can be consulting, freelancing, working for steady clients or full time contracts with companies. I'll categorise them in 3 buckets and list some resources where you can find opportunities for that category.</p> <h3 id="freelancing-platforms"> Freelancing Platforms</h3> <p>You can freelance on projects remotely on freelancing platforms. Examples include Upwork, Freelancer, etc where you can join, create a profile and start bidding on projects.</p> <p>While this is a good option to work on projects you're interested in, I tend to prefer not working on them as a career choice. All clients are not the same, so it needs a lot of calibration every time you start a new project.</p> <p>Clients generally choose these platforms for cost optimisation. So, the engineering standards are generally a bit lower and the deadline pressures are more intense.</p> <p>This also means variable workload and variable income, which makes planning your time and life harder. But I have worked on projects intermittently on Upwork before and it can be a good path to pursue if it suits you.</p> <p>Here's a list of popular freelancing platforms:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://www.upwork.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upwork</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.fiverr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fiverr</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.freelancer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Freelancer</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.guru.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guru</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.peopleperhour.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">peopleperhour</a></li></ul> <h3 id="agency-platforms"> Agency Platforms</h3> <p>Some platforms employ a vetting process and only allow successful candidates on their platforms. For the lack of a better word, I call them agency platforms. These platforms are on the rise and I see new ones every now and then.</p> <p>Once you're on the platform, you may have to bid for projects again or you may be paired with companies depending on the type of the platform. But you'll be working as a member of the platform and the platform will take a cut off your earnings.</p> <p>One major downside of both these types of platforms is that you don't get any paid time offs (PTO). If you don't work, you don't get paid. You don't get any other perks or benefits either. But once you get yourself on these platforms, it may be easier to land clients or contracts (and better ones) than on platforms mentioned in the first category. Remember to check reviews before joining. Do not join if you don't like their practices.</p> <p>Here's a list of some platforms in this category:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://www.toptal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toptal</a></li> <li><a href="https://x-team.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X-Team</a></li> <li><a href="https://turing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turing</a></li> <li><a href="https://triplebyte.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TripleByte</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.vettery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vettery</a></li> <li><a href="https://6nomads.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">6nomads</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.crossover.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crossover</a></li></ul> <p>This list is not exhaustive and there's a lot of other platforms like these. I haven't worked on any of these, so do your review before you decide to join.</p> <h3 id="remote-companies"> Remote Companies</h3> <p>Remote-first or full-remote companies fall in this category. The number of such companies is increasing rapidly, thanks to the pandemic. You can apply to these companies directly from their job posts and work as independent contractors after you successfully complete their recruitment process.</p> <p>I prefer this category of remote work because you get to work for the company directly. Generally, the teams and cultures are better in companies who hire directly.</p> <p>Similarly, the compensations and benefits are better as well. Most of them will provide PTOs and have good practices around remote work.</p> <p>Some popular companies that hire remotely are:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://doist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doist</a></li> <li><a href="https://zapier.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zapier</a></li> <li><a href="https://buffer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buffer</a></li> <li><a href="https://gitlab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gitlab</a></li> <li><a href="https://automattic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automattic</a></li> <li><a href="https://basecamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Basecamp</a></li></ul> <p>There are many job forums and aggregate websites that you can subscribe to for job openings in remote companies. You can create email subscriptions according to your choices. Here's a list of some popular remote job forums:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://weworkremotely.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">We Work Remotely</a></li> <li><a href="https://remoteok.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RemoteOK</a></li> <li><a href="https://angel.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AngelList</a></li> <li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/jobs?r=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stack OverFlow jobs</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/remote-jobs-SRCH_KO0,6.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glass Door Jobs</a></li> <li><a href="https://remotecircle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RemoteCircle</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RemoteJobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit Remote Jobs Forum</a></li> <li><a href="https://remotive.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remotive</a></li> <li><a href="https://jobs.underpin.company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Underpin</a></li> <li><a href="https://remote.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote.co</a></li> <li><a href="http://remote4me.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote4Me</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/remote-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn jobs</a></li> <li><a href="http://remotepython.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote Python</a></li></ul> <p>These platforms are great for job search.

							<p>One of my favorite makefile debugging tricks is this rule for printing out the value of a variable:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">print-%:
        @echo '$*=$($*)'</span></pre>
<p>
Throw this into a GNU make makefile and then print any <span><span face="Courier New">make</span></span> variable you like by invoking targets like <span><span face="Courier New">print-MAKE_VERSION</span></span>:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">ericm@chester:/tmp$ gmake print-MAKE_VERSION
MAKE_VERSION=3.81</span></pre>
<p>
You can imagine how handy this is when diagnosing issues with your makefiles.  Here’s how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li><span><span face="Courier New">print-%</span></span> defines a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Pattern-Rules"><i>pattern rule</i></a> that matches any target that starts with the characters <span><span face="Courier New">print-</span></span>.</li>
<li>In the context of a pattern rule, the <span><span face="Courier New">$*</span></span> variable expands to the <i>stem</i> of the target, that part which matched the <span><span face="Courier New">%</span></span> in the pattern.  In my example above, that corresponds to <i>MAKE_VERSION</i>.</li>
<li>GNU make variable expansion rules allow for variable references <i>inside</i> variable names, so <span><span face="Courier New">$($*)</span></span> expands first to <span><span face="Courier New">$(MAKE_VERSION)</span></span>, and finally to the value of the <span><span face="Courier New">MAKE_VERSION</span></span> variable.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Makefile injection with <span face="Courier New">-f</span></h3>
<p>
The <span><span face="Courier New">print-%</span></span> rule is a slick hack, but it’s a nuisance to have to modify a makefile just to use it.  Worse, you might not even be able to modify the makefile.  Fortunately, there’s a solution:  the <span><span face="Courier New">-f</span></span> command-line option.  You’re probably familiar with it — that’s how you tell gmake to use a different makefile than the default <span><span face="Courier New">Makefile</span></span> when it starts.  For example, if you have a  makefile named <span><span face="Courier New">build.mak</span></span>:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">gmake -f build.mak</span></pre>
<p>
What you may not know is that you can use <i>multiple</i> <span><span face="Courier New">-f</span></span> options on the command line.  GNU make will read each file in turn, incorporating the contents of each just as if they were included with the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Include"><span><span face="Courier New">include</span></span></a> directive.  We can create a simple makefile called <span><span face="Courier New">printvar.mak</span></span> containing nothing but our <span><span face="Courier New">print-%</span></span> rule, then inject it into any makefile we want like this:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">gmake -f printvar.mak -f Makefile print-MAKE_VERSION</span></pre>
<h3>A shell script to save typing</h3>
<p>
The combination of the <span><span face="Courier New">print-%</span></span> rule and the <span><span face="Courier New">-f</span></span> command-line option is powerful, but it’s unwieldy — too many characters to type.  The solution is a shell script wrapper:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">#!/bin/bash

filename=""
if [ -f GNUmakefile ] ; then
  filename="GNUmakefile"
elif [ -f makefile ] ; then
  filename="makefile"
elif [ -f Makefile ] ; then
  filename="Makefile"
fi
if [ -n "$filename" ] ; then
  vars=""
  for n in $@ ; do
    vars="$vars print-$n"
  done
  gmake -f $filename -f printvar.mak $vars
else
  echo "No makefile found" 1&gt;&amp;2
  exit 1
fi</span></pre>
<p>
Save that in a file called <span><span face="Courier New">printvars</span></span> somewhere on your <span><span face="Courier New">PATH</span></span> and you can do things like this:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">ericm@chester:/tmp$ printvars MAKE_VERSION COMPILE.cc
MAKE_VERSION=3.81
COMPILE.cc=g++    -c</span></pre>
<h3>Advanced <span><span face="Courier New">make</span></span> variable diagnostics</h3>
<p>
Beyond simply printing the value of a variable, GNU make 3.81 has three built-in functions that allow introspection on variables, which you can add to the <span><span face="Courier New">print-%</span></span> rule for additional diagnostics.</p>
<p>
First is the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Origin-Function"><span><span face="Courier New">$(origin)</span></span></a> function, which tells you how a variable was defined.  For example, if a variable <span><span face="Courier New">FOO</span></span> was inherited from the environment, <span><span face="Courier New">$(origin FOO)</span></span> will give the result <span><span face="Courier New">environment</span></span>.  Variables defined in a makefile will give the result <span><span face="Courier New">file</span></span>, and so forth.</p>
<p>
Next is the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Flavor-Function"><span><span face="Courier New">$(flavor)</span></span></a> function, which tells you the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Flavors">flavor of the variable</a>, either <span><span face="Courier New">simple</span></span> or <span><span face="Courier New">recursive</span></span>.</p>
<p>
Finally is the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Value-Function"><span><span face="Courier New">$(value)</span></span></a> function, which gives you the <i>unexpanded</i> value of the variable.  For example, if you have variables like this:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">FOO=123
BAR=$(FOO)</span></pre>
<p>
<span><span face="Courier New">$(value BAR)</span></span> will give the result <span><span face="Courier New">$(FOO)</span></span>, rather than the fully-expanded <span><span face="Courier New">123</span></span> that you might expect.</p>
<p>
With these additions, the <span><span face="Courier New">print-%</span></span> rule now looks like this:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">print-%:
	@echo '$*=$($*)'
	@echo '  origin = $(origin $*)'
	@echo '  flavor = $(flavor $*)'
	@echo '   value = $(value  $*)'</span></pre>
<p>
And here’s how it looks in action:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">ericm@chester:/tmp$ printvars MAKE_VERSION COMPILE.cc
MAKE_VERSION=3.81
  origin = default
  flavor = simple
   value = 3.81
COMPILE.cc=g++    -c
  origin = default
  flavor = recursive
   value = $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) $(TARGET_ARCH) -c</span></pre>

      <p>We’ve joined <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/making-twitter-a-better-home-for-writers.html?utm_campaign=The%20week%20in%20newsletters&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. This is big news for people who use Revue, people who will start using Revue and the whole team who built it. So in this email I wanted to go a little deeper than just this news. And that’s what email does better than any other platform. It lets you go deeper with a wide audience, both in your relationship and in your thinking. Add nuance, context, speak personally.</p><p>That experience inspired us to build the first version of Revue. We wanted to make sending an email newsletter as simple and enjoyable as Tweeting. That core goal has never changed, but the world around us sure has.</p><p>Email has become a much more important publishing platform. The publishing world is working even harder at its re-invention. And we’re proud to be part of that. Today, Revue makes it easy for a wide variety of creators and publishers to send a newsletter — and make money from it.</p><p>We help them find an audience, create a deep connection and grow without limits.</p><p>Today, we serve a spectrum of customers, from ambitious media upstarts like The Markup to independent creators like Scott Melker and even large legacy publishers like Germany’s Madsack. And while different, all of them come to Revue for one purpose: to transform how we share and absorb content.&nbsp;</p><p>They want to change the way publishing works. Who gets heard and who gets paid. And that’s what connects their goals to us, the people who build Revue.</p><p>The folks over at Twitter are amazing partners who believe in and add to our mission. Thanks to them we can invest more, build faster, and get better for you.</p><p>Thanks to our joining Twitter, we can make publishing on email even more accessible. As a first step, we’re excited to share some updates that will improve the way you can build and get paid for your content:</p><p>🤝 Starting a newsletter on Revue is now free</p><p>🤝 On paid newsletters, we only charge 5%</p><p>We’ve made these changes so that everyone can be a creator on Revue, with the opportunity to scale their newsletters and a paying audience without the added fees or obstacles that can limit growth.</p><p>One important element to our customers success is giving you full control. You own your audience, your content, your brand. You can send from your own domain. You can connect Revue to hundreds of other tools without coding. And of course we have an API for you to build on.</p><p>We are also building a version of Revue for larger creators and publications. They have even more control, This version offers features like fully custom designs and tools to help them manage their audience, cross-promote newsletters and include subscription offers.</p><p>For now, we’ll continue to operate as a standalone business. But expect to hear more about how we’re working with Twitter soon as we look at more ways to help you grow faster, be discovered more easily and build even deeper connections.</p><p>Our goal is to create the single best place in the world for media businesses of the future to start, to grow big and to innovate. There is a lot to do, so we’ll keep working on it — along with all the people who use Revue.</p><p>🧡</p><p>Martijn, Founder</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/img/posts/react-as-generator-engine.webp" alt="Post cover image"><p>React permanently changed the way how developers write web-apps. Personally, we love React and knew it would solve many pain points we faced with Nunjucks. Therefore in the last <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/shape-up-process/issues/1">cycle</a> we integrated it as a template rendering engine into our <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator">Generator</a>. This post is a short introduction for developers who write or plan to write templates for AsyncAPI specification using React. It also includes a comparison with the default Nunjucks renderer.</p><h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2><p>Your React template requires <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk">@asyncapi/generator-react-sdk</a> as a dependency. You need it to access the <strong>File</strong> component required as a root component responsible for rendering a file. Furthermore, it provides some common components to make your development easier, like <strong>Text</strong> or <strong>Indent</strong>.	</p><p>Let's consider a basic React template file as the one below called <strong>MyTemplate.js</strong>:</p><p>The exported default function returns the <strong>File</strong> component as a root component that the <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator">Generator</a> uses to figure out what file it should generate. In the example above, we overwrite the default functionality of saving the file as <strong>MyTemplate.js</strong>, and we set <strong>asyncapi.md</strong> as the filename. Using the <strong>Text</strong> component, we specify what content should be rendered inside the file. The content of the resulting file is: <code>Some text that should render as is\n</code>. Notice the <strong>\n</strong> character at the end. It is automatically added after the <strong>Text</strong> component.</p><blockquote><p>For further information about components and their props, see the <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk">Generator React SDK</a>.	 </p></blockquote><p>The <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator">Generator</a> doesn't use React renderer by default. You need to specify in the template configuration that your template is based on React. For that, change the <strong>renderer</strong> field of <strong>generator</strong> object inside the template's <strong>package.json</strong> file:</p><p>You can find more information about the Generator configuration <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator/blob/master/docs/authoring.md#configuration-file">here</a>.	 </p><h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2><p>The process of creating content from React components consists of two steps: transpile and render.	 </p><p>The SDK has a custom transpiler which ensures that any directory in template's <strong>template</strong> folder are transpiled using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup">Rollup</a>. Rollup helps bundling all dependencies and transpile them into CommonJS modules. This is required because this library will be used through NodeJS (by AsyncAPI Generator) which does not understand these new modules natively and we do not want to limit the developer in which syntax they prefer nor how they want to separate code.</p><p>Also, SDK has its own reconciler. It traverses through each element in the template structure and transforms it into a pure string. Prop <code>children</code> is always converted to a regular string and stored in the <code>childrenContent</code> prop in each component. Check the below example, to see how it works. In addition, you can also see how to apply the composition to templates using components:</p><p>There are some restrictions:</p><ul><li>React hooks feature is not allowed.</li><li>HTML tags are not supported.</li><li>React internal components like <code>Fragments</code>, <code>Suspense</code>, and others are skipped.</li></ul><h2 id="comparison-with-nunjucks">Comparison with Nunjucks</h2><p>The AsyncAPI generator still uses <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/">Nunjucks</a> as a default render engine. It's a templating language, heavily focused on string literals, filters (similar to bash pipes), and partials called macros.	</p><p>The next sections compare how you can accomplish certain things in Nunjucks and React. For more complex examples, see the <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/template-for-generator-templates">template-for-generator-templates</a> repository with examples based on React and compare those with <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/template-for-generator-templates/tree/nunjucks">nunjucks</a> branch.</p><h3 id="creating-reusable-parts">Creating reusable parts</h3><p>It may sound obvious, but when writing any code, even a template, a programmer wants to create reusable parts that separate repeating logic.</p><p>In Nunjucks, you can reuse parts of the template using <strong>macros</strong>, in React, using <strong>components</strong>. Imagine that you are writing a template that produces Markdown content. You need to create a reusable macro/component that renders a list from an array of strings.</p><p>Using Nunjucks you can write the code below:</p><p>Using React you can write the code below:</p><p>Looking at both examples we see that in Nujucks we operate on string literals, it means that when passing data to a macro, you always need to know what type of data the macro takes. In React we operate on JS objects/variables. By this, your IDE should always inform you what value, of what type, you must pass to component. Additionally, you must place Nunjucks's macro inside the <strong>partials</strong> folder of the template. Using React, you can put your components wherever you want.</p><h3 id="using-third-party-packages">Using third party packages</h3><p>Using helper functions from third-party packages, in Nunjucks you must apply them as <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator/blob/master/docs/authoring.md#filters">filters</a>. For example, you want to use one function from <a href="https://github.com/esamattis/underscore.string">Underscore.string</a> library like <strong>cleanDiacritics</strong>, which replaces diacritic characters with closest ASCII equivalents. To do this, you must create a function inside <strong>filters</strong> folder to convert the function to Nunjucks's filter:</p><p>And then you can use this function inside your template/macro:</p><p>The main problem with this solution is that it creates an unnecessary boilerplate - you must create a function in a separate file. Another problem is that you operate on the name of this helper function which means you must always remember what filters you have included in your template.</p><p>In opposite, in React you can use <code>Underscore.string</code> directly in your template:</p><p>It is worth mentioning that when using packages in this way, you always operate on the reference to the function, not on its name, so you know what functions you have in the file's scope.</p><h2 id="cons--pros">Cons &amp; Pros</h2><p>Like any solution, React has its advantages as well as disadvantages.</p><h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3><ul><li>Using React, you use JS directly. You don't need to learn custom Nunjuck's syntax, only how React works under the hood.</li><li>It provides better debugging functionality that is not possible with Nunjucks.</li><li>It provides better error stack traces.</li><li>Better tools support development. You write templates in JavaScript, you use a reference to functions/variables, and therefore your IDE can tell you what you can use in a given scope.	</li><li>Provides better support for separating code into more manageable chunks/components. You don't need to create <strong>partials</strong> folder. You can create React component wherever you want, also next to the template's source code.</li><li>You can easily test your components. It is difficult with Nunjucks. You can split template file into separate chunks and test them in separate test cases.</li></ul><h3 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h3><ul><li>Common pain when writing templates with React is related to indentations and new lines. However, we have several helpers in SDK to make your life easier, like <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk/blob/master/src/components/Indent.tsx"><code>Indent</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk/blob/master/src/components/Text.tsx"><code>Text</code></a> components.</li><li>Some people don't like to mix logic inside template files, so probably React won't be friendly for them.</li><li>HTML tags at the moment are not supported. The developer must write them as a string literal, like <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/template-for-generator-templates/blob/main/components/ListChannels.js#L18">here</a>.</li></ul><h2 id="resources">Resources</h2><p>We use React render engine already in three official AsyncAPI templates:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/template-for-generator-templates">template-for-generator-templates</a> template showcases features of <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator">the AsyncAPI Generator</a>, including the React renderer. It shows how to write templates, reusable parts (components), what are the recommended patterns. It has simple and complex examples. You can also check how the same things could be done using Nunjucks in <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/template-for-generator-templates/tree/nunjucks">this</a> branch.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/markdown-template">markdown-template</a> is written using React. It generates documentation into a Markdown file.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/ts-nats-template/">ts-nats-template</a> is re-written using React to generate a TypeScript NATS client.</li></ul><p>If you want to check the source code of React renderer, go to the <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk">official repository</a>.</p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>There is a long way ahead of us to stabilize React as a render engine. We know about problems that make it unpleasant to write templates using React, such as indents or new lines, but we will work on that. Additionally, we have a couple of improvements on our list that will allow things like <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk/issues/10">File Templates</a> to be simplified in the Generator. We also plan to support <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk/issues/3">TypeScript</a>.</p><p>We are waiting for your feedback.</p><p>Happy coding!</p><blockquote><p>Cover photo is from <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080179/"><code>Drunken Master</code></a> movie.</p></blockquote></article></div>]]>

<p>In Appsmith, our developer users define business logic by writing any JS code in between <code>{{ }}</code> dynamic bindings almost anywhere in the app. They can use this while creating SQL queries, APIs, or triggering actions.
This functionality lets you control how your app behaves with the least amount of configuration. Underneath the hood, the platform will evaluate all this code in an optimized manner to make sure the app remains performant yet responsive.</p>
<p>Let us take an example of binding a query response to a table widget.</p>
<p>It all starts with the binding brackets <code>{{ }}</code> . When the platform sees these brackets and some code in it, in a widget or action configuration, it will flag the field as a dynamic field so that our evaluator can pick it up later. In our example let us bind usersQuery to usersTable</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1608182443695/gunous9nM.png?auto=compress" alt="Screenshot_2020-12-05_at_2.46.08_PM.png"></p>
<p>Since we have added this binding in our tableData field, we will flag this field and store it in our widget config</p>
<pre><code>
{
  <span>"usersTable"</span>: {
        ...
        <span>"tableData"</span>: <span>"{{
            usersQuery.data
                .map(row =&gt; ({
                    name: row.name,
                    email: row.email
                }))
            }}"</span>,
        <span>"dynaminBindingPathList"</span>: [
            {<span>"key"</span>: <span>"tableData"</span>}
            ...
        ]
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the background, our evaluation listener, always keeps a lookout for such events that would need an evaluation. For our example, this is a scenario that definitely needs an evaluation, so it kicks off our evaluator.</p>
<p>We pass on our current list of app data constructed in what we call as <code>DataTree</code> to the evaluator thread and patiently wait to hear back from it ⏱</p>
<pre><code>
{
    <span>"usersQuery"</span>: {
        <span>"config"</span>: {...},
        <span>"data"</span>: [...]
    },
    <span>"usersTable"</span>: {
        <span>"tableData"</span>: <span>"{{
            usersQuery.data
                .map(row =&gt; ({
                    name: row.name,
                    email: row.email
                }))
            }}"</span>,
        <span>"dynaminBindingPathList"</span>: [{<span>"key"</span>: <span>"tableData"</span>}]
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>For performance reasons, we run our evaluation process in a separate background thread with the help of <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API">web workers</a>. This ensures that evaluation cycles running longer than 16ms do not hang up the main thread giving the app bandwidth to always respond to user events.</p>
<p>Inside the thread, the event listener gets a wake-up call and gets to work. </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Get differences</strong>: First it will calculate differences in the <code>DataTree</code> from the last time. This will ensure we only process changes and not the whole tree.</p>
<p>  In our example, we would see the <code>usersTable.tableData</code> has changed and <code>usersTable.dynamicBindingPathList</code> has a new entry.</p>
<p>  It takes each difference, filters any un-important changes, and processes the rest.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Get evaluation order with dependency map</strong>: It also maintains a <code>DependencyMap</code> between various entity properties. The evaluator will notice if any bindings have changed and recreate the sort order accordingly.</p>
<p>  For our example, we will infer that <code>usersTable.tableData</code> now depends on <code>usersQuery.data</code>. This means that the query response should always be evaluated before we can evaluate the table data and that whenever we see a change in the query response, we need to re-evaluate the table data as well</p>
<pre><code>  
  {
      ...
      <span>"usersTable.tableData"</span>: [<span>"usersQuery.data"</span>]
  }

  
  [
      <span>"usersQuery.data"</span>,
      <span>"usersTable.tableData"</span>
  ]
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Evaluate:</strong> After creating an optimized evaluation order, we will evaluate the update the tree, in that said order. Evaluation happens via a closed <code>eval</code> function with the whole <code>DataTree</code> acting as its global scope. This is why we can directly reference any object in our <code>DataTree</code> in our code.</p>
<pre><code>  

  <span>const</span> code = <span>`
    usersQuery.data.map(row =&gt; ({
      name: row.name,
      email: row.email
    }))
  `</span>;

  <span>const</span> scriptToEvaluate = <span>`
    function closedFunction () {
      const result = <span>${code}</span>;
      return result
    }
    closedFunction()
  `</span>;

  <span>const</span> result = <span>eval</span>(scriptToEvaluate);
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Validate and parse:</strong> We always want to make sure the values returned after evaluation to be in the right data type that the widget expects. The ensures the widget always gets predictable data even if your code has returned some errors. This is also needed for any function down the line in the evaluation order, if it refers to this field, will always get a reasonable data type to work with.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And that completes it. At the end of this, we will have a fully evaluated <code>DataTree</code> that we can then send back to the main thread and start listening for any new event to do this whole process again.</p>
<pre><code>
{
    <span>"usersQuery"</span>: {
        <span>"data"</span>: [...] 
    }
    <span>"usersTable"</span>: {
        <span>"tableData"</span>: [...]
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Our main thread gets an event saying the evaluation is complete, with the new evaluated <code>DataTree</code> which it stores in the app redux state. From here, the widgets pick up their data and render it.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1608182466454/vym6oXaQG.png?auto=compress" alt="Screenshot_2020-12-05_at_2.46.22_PM.png"></p>
<h3 id="summarizing-our-philosophy">Summarizing our philosophy</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pull vs Push:</strong> While building a low code app builder for varied developers, we thought hard about how the written code works with the rest of the platform. We wanted configuration to be easy to start yet powerful when it needed to be. For this reason, we went with a Pull based architecture rather than Push.</p>
<p>  What this means is that in most places, you won't have to think about how the data will get to a field. You write code that pulls everything from the global <code>DataTree</code> and sets it to the field where you write it. This way the moment the underlying data changes, it get propagated to all the fields dependant on it and you as a developer do not have to orchestrate ui changes.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong> One-way data flow:</strong> Since we are built on top React.js and Redux, we strongly embrace the one-way data flow model.</p>
<p>  What this means is that you cannot set a table's data directly to that field from some other part of the app. If you do need to update the table, you will have to trigger the query to run, which will then cause the table to re-render with the new data. This helps the code you write easy to reason about and bugs easy to find. It also encapsulates each widget's and action's logic in itself for good separation of concern.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>Before we begin, I have an announcement to make regarding the future of this podcast. Beginning February 1st, <em>The Grant Williams Podcast</em> will become part of the copper membership tier of my new website, <a href="https://grant-williams.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grant-williams.com</a>. Now, the copper tier will include every future episode of the end game, the super terrific happy hour and the narrative game, as well as access to a series of special one-on-one conversations I’ll be having with a group of truly extraordinary people throughout the rest of this year, beginning with my dear friend and mentor, Anthony Deden of Edelweiss Holdings. At the site, you’ll also find a silver tier, which in addition to access to <em>The Grant Williams Podcast</em>, will include a year subscription to my monthly newsletter, <em>Things That Make You Go Hmmm…</em> But you can find out a lot more about all that by visiting <a href="https://grant-williams.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grant-williams.com</a>. And now on with the show.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>Something that’s fascinated me over the last 12 months has been how keen people are to hear my views on cryptocurrencies in general and Bitcoin in particular. I’ve tried to lay out my position as clearly as I can over that year. And I’ll do the same again here. I understand the bull case for crypto very, very well. In many ways, it’s a similar case to the one I’ve been making myself over the years for gold. Because of that, I’ve been predisposed to be bullish on Bitcoin, but like anything I come across that looks interesting, I maintain what I view as a healthy level of skepticism until I’ve had any fears allayed. As far as Bitcoin goes, I’m just not quite there yet. There are things which concern me about its long-term viability. And so until I can have those questions answered to my satisfaction, Bitcoin, to me, remains a highly speculative asset.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>The difficulty I’ve found in getting my questions answered stems largely from the binary opinion set that I’ve found wherever I’ve searched for those answers. Bitcoin, it seems is either going to eat the world or it’s a complete Ponzi scheme. And finding a space between those two opinions where my possible answers might lie, has proven very difficult for me. Last week, an extremely negative article about Tether, the supposedly dollar-backed stablecoin, did the rounds and from the commentary and discussion around that article, the idea of a debate rose organically on FinTwit, a debate that I was asked to moderate. Needless to say in my own search for answers to my questions, I was happy to oblige. And so here we are.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>Joining me today are Mike Green of Logica Funds, a man with a towering intellect and a decidedly negative view of Bitcoin (and Tether for that matter). And Nic Carter, co-founder of Castle Island Ventures &amp; CoinMetrics and another man in position of some serious intellectual firepower, but who sees Bitcoin in a completely different and extremely positive light. But the idea here is to offer both sides of the Bitcoin debate, a chance to speak and engage respectfully with the other, in the hopes of providing anybody listening with something to either challenge their own assumptions, answer nagging questions they might have, or simply provide them with some good old fashioned confirmation bias. The goal isn’t to change anybody’s mind about Bitcoin, although who knows, maybe that can actually happen in either direction, but rather to have a thoughtful, respectful conversation about what is… No matter which side of the debate you find yourself on the hottest topic in finance right now. So let’s get to it. A conversation with Mike Green and Nic Carter.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>Gentlemen, welcome both of you to this special podcast that kind of arose organically. And I’m absolutely delighted that the two you were willing to take the time to come on and talk about this because there’s been so much said and written about Bitcoin, obviously, on both sides and right at the top of the show, I’m going to position myself and explain to everybody where I am because I think that’s important for the guy in the middle to understand. I like to refer myself as a ‘bit skeptic’. I understand the potential promise of Bitcoin. I’ve heard some very smart people say very smart things about… A lot of which resonates with me from my time in the precious metals space, but I have questions that I just don’t really… There are things that just don’t quite click with me.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>There are problems that I worry about and what I’ve found when I’ve been on the fringes of this space is that, it’s difficult to get thoughtful, considered answers that… Particularly on Twitter. Thoughtful, considered answers, that don’t just degenerate very quickly into a slanging match from both sides. So to have two thoughtful guys like you, join me on the podcast is a real treat for me. So thank you both for doing that.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>What we’re going to do, I think, is start talking about Bitcoin. And then as part of the conversation that I want to discuss, however, briefly, or however long it takes, the recent Tether piece, the doomsday piece, which got everybody’s in a flat a few days ago. So I think what I might do is start with you, Nic. And just to give us really your kind of introduction to Bitcoin and your thoughts on what it is and what it potentially could be. And perhaps any of the things that trouble you about it, if there is anything, in fact.</p><p>Nic Carter:</p><p>Sure. Yeah. And thanks so much for moderating, Grant. I’m a big fan of your show. And Mike, thanks for agreeing to the debate as well. I’m really excited to talk with you. A fan of yours as well. So from my perspective, I’ve been sort of professionally involved in Bitcoin probably since about 2017. It was when I joined Fidelity as their Bitcoin analyst, right. So I was probably one of the first folks on Wall Street sort of be a dedicated Bitcoin guy. Prior to that, I was just an enthusiast, right. I was an amateur Bitcoiner. I mean, there wasn’t really a crypto industry before that, right. And now, my current affiliation is partner at a venture fund and we invest in startups building on public blockchains. So, I certainly believe in this stuff, putting my capital to work, and I believe in the vision of the future that includes cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Nic Carter:</p><p>The way I see Bitcoin is, it’s kind of two things in one. It is a protocol for sending value through communications medium and encoding value and information. And it’s also an asset. It’s a monetary asset and I would compare it to commodity. So I would say it’s a non-state monetary commodity. It’s something that stores value over time and space. And it’s an independent system of property rights where rather it proposes a state independent system of property rights. So you don’t need an established legal system or a police force or the state to enforce the rights. The rights are enforced through cryptography. And so in that respect, it’s sort of contextually important. So in some cases where you have a functioning financial system, functioning legal system, that has no risk of expropriation, you have no need for Bitcoin, right.</p><p>Nic Carter:</p><p>So in the US, that would characterize most people. They’re puzzled by it. They don’t really see the need for a Bitcoin because everything works great here for now, at least. In other countries where property rights are not really respected and you have inflation or devaluations, or just simply people’s funds, banks accounts get seized on a frequent basis, then maybe there is more of a need for a non-state system. So those are the countries where we’re seeing some adoption of Bitcoin. You also see plenty of Americans getting exposure to it, maybe an anticipation of a future time when it becomes super relevant or just out of the speculative mania too.</p><p>Nic Carter:</p><p>But quite briefly, that’s how I see it. I think it’s important for there to be non-state monetary technologies. I think Bitcoin is extremely promising and it improves upon gold in some really critical respects, particularly along the domain of auditability, verifiability and taking physical settlement, which is where I think it really improves upon gold. But I think if you are positively disposed towards gold, you should probably take a look at Bitcoin because it’s really similar in some of its critical features. Although, of course, not the same thing by any means. So that’s my sort of very short description of Bitcoin.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>Yeah. It’s really interesting. And I think my time spent in the precious metal space where my… I was originally exposed to Bitcoin, I saw the similarities between the Bitcoin proposition as it was then, and the things that gold has. I definitely have a few questions about those supposed improvements upon gold, which we’ll get into later on. But I want to turn it over to Mike. Mike, just if you can, your… Because, obviously, your view on Bitcoin is the polar opposite to Nic’s. And so I’m curious to get an overview of that and the things that concern you the most. And then we can perhaps dive into some of these things.</p><p>Mike Green:</p><p>So it’s interesting because I actually don’t think that we are necessarily polar opposites. I think that we have very strongly divergent opinions in terms of the value of it. So my introduction to Bitcoin happened back in 2012, my wife likes to point out that she expressed interest in buying it at $25 and wanted to put $10,000 in. And I said, “Well, why don’t we actually put money in that matters?” And so do $100,000. And she, of course, said that’s far too much and did nothing with it, right. Now, my view on Bitcoin for a very long time was get yourself to neutral. Own enough that it’s not going to make you crazy rich and own enough that you’re not sitting there with an incredible amount of FOMO as you watch others get rich around you.</p><p>Mike Green:</p><p>I changed that view in 2020 for a very, very simple reason, which is, as I began to see the dynamic of Americans express the view that Bitcoin was the solution to an overly aggressive central …</p></div></div></div></div>

  <div>
    <p>I’ve been a contributor to GNU projects for many years, notably both GCC and GNU libc, and recently I led the effort to make the first release of Autoconf since 2012 (<a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf/2020-12/msg00002.html">release announcement for Autoconf 2.70</a>). For background and context, see <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/834682/">the LWN article my colleague Sumana Harihareswara of Changeset Consulting wrote</a>.</p>
<p>Autoconf not having made a release in eight years is a symptom of a deeper problem. Many GNU projects, including all of the other components of the Autotools (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/">Automake</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/">Libtool</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/">Gnulib</a>, etc.) and the software they depend upon (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/m4/">GNU M4</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU Make</a>, etc.) have seen a steady decline in both contributor enthusiasm and user base over the past decade. I include myself in the group of declining enthusiasts; I would not have done the work leading up to the Autoconf 2.70 release if I had not been paid to do it. (I would like to say thank you to the project funders: Bloomberg, Keith Bostic, and the GNU Toolchain Fund of the FSF.)</p>
<p>The Autotools are in particularly bad shape due to the decline in contributor enthusiasm. Preparation for the Autoconf 2.70 release took almost twice as long as anticipated; I made five beta releases between July and December 2020, and merged 157 patches, most of them bugfixes. On more than one occasion I was asked why I was going to the trouble—isn’t Autoconf (and the rest of the tools by implication) thoroughly obsolete? Why doesn’t everyone switch to something newer, like <a href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a> or <a href="https://mesonbuild.com/">Meson</a>? (See the comments on Sumana’s LWN article for examples.)</p>
<p>I personally don’t think that the Autotools are obsolete, or even all that much more difficult to work with than some of the alternatives, but it <em>is</em> a fair question. Should development of the Autotools continue? If they are to continue, we need to find people who have the time and the inclination (and perhaps also the funding) to maintain them steadily, rather than in six-month release sprints every eight years. We also need a proper roadmap for where further development should take these projects. As a starting point for the conversation about whether the projects should continue, and what the roadmap should be, I was inspired by Sumana’s book in progress on open source project management (<a href="https://changeset.nyc/resources/getting-unstuck-sampler-offer.html">sample chapters are available from her website</a>) to write up a <q>strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats</q> analysis of Autotools.</p>
<p>This inventory can help us figure out how to build on new opportunities, using the Autotools’ substantial strengths, and where to invest to guard against threats and shore up current weaknesses.</p>
<p>Followup discussion should go to <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/autoconf">the Autoconf mailing list</a>.</p>

<h2 id="strengths">Strengths</h2>
<p>In summary: as the category leader for decades, the Autotools benefit from their architectural approach, interoperability, edge case coverage, standards adherence, user trust, and existing install base.</p>
<ul>
<li>Autoconf’s feature-based approach to compiled-code portability scales better than lists of system quirks.</li>
<li>The Autotools carry 30+ years’ worth of embedded knowledge about portability traps for C programs and shell-based build scripting on Unix (and to a lesser extent Windows and others), including variants of Unix that no other comparable configuration tool supports.</li>
<li>Autoconf and Automake support cross-compilation better than competing build systems.</li>
<li>Autoconf and Automake support software written in multiple languages better than some competing build systems (but see below).</li>
<li>Autoconf is very extensible, and there are lots of third-party <q>macros</q> available.</li>
<li>Tarball releases produced by Autotools have fewer build dependencies than tarball releases produced by competing tools.</li>
<li>Tarball releases produced by Autotools have a predictable, standardized (literally; it’s a key aspect of the <q><a href="https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/index.html">GNU Coding Standards</a></q>) interface for setting build-time options, building them, testing them, and installing them.</li>
<li>Automake tries very hard to generate Makefiles that will work with <em>any</em> Make implementation, not just GNU make, and not even just (GNU or BSD) make.</li>
<li>The Autotools have excellent reference-level documentation (better than CMake and Meson’s).</li>
<li>As they are GNU projects, users can have confidence that Autotools are and will always remain Free Software.</li>
<li>Relatedly, users can trust that architectural decisions are not driven by the needs of particular large corporations.</li>
<li>There is a large installed base, and switching to a competing build system is a lot of work.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="weaknesses">Weaknesses</h2>
<p>In summary: Autoconf’s core function is to solve a problem that software developers, working primarily in C, had in the 1990s/early 2000s (during the Unix wars). System programming interfaces have become much more standardized since then, and the shell environment, much less buggy. Developers of new code, today, looking at existing configure scripts and documentation, cannot easily determine which of the portability traps Autoconf knows about are still relevant to them. Similarly, maintainers of older programs have a hard time knowing which of their existing portability checks are still necessary. And weak coordination with other Autotools compounds the issue.</p>
<h3 id="autoconf">Autoconf</h3>
<ul>
<li>Autoconf (and the rest of the Autotools) are written in a combination of four old and difficult programming languages: Bourne shell, the portable subset of Make, Perl, and M4. Competing build systems tend to use newer, more ergonomic languages, which both makes it easier for them to get things done, and makes it easier for them to attract new developers.</li>
<li>All the supported languages except C and C++ are second-class citizens.</li>
<li>The set of languages that are supported has no particular rationale. Several new and increasingly popular compiled-code languages (e.g.&nbsp;Swift and Rust) are not supported, while oddities like Erlang are.</li>
<li>Much of that 30 years’ worth of embedded knowledge about portability traps is obsolete. There’s no systematic policy for deciding when some problem is too obsolete to worry about anymore.</li>
<li>Support for <em>newer</em> platforms, C standard editions, etc. is weaker than support for older things.</li>
<li>Autoconf’s extensibility is unsystematic; many of those third-party macros reach into its guts, and do things that create awkward compatibility constraints on core development. Same for existing <code>configure.ac</code>s.</li>
<li>The code quality of third-party macros varies widely; bad third-party macros reflect poorly on Autoconf proper.</li>
<li>Some of the ancillary tools distributed with Autoconf don’t work well; most importantly, autoupdate (which is <em>supposed</em> to patch a <code>configure.ac</code> to bring it in line with current Autoconf’s recommendations) is so limited and unreliable that it might be better not to have it at all.</li>
<li>Feature gaps in GNU M4 hold back development of Autoconf.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-autotools-as-a-whole">The Autotools as a whole</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are few active developers and no continuing funders.</li>
<li>GNU project status discourages new contributors because of the paperwork requirements and the perceived lack of executive-level leadership.</li>
<li>There is no continuous integration and no culture of code review. Test suites exist but are not comprehensive enough (and at the same time they’re very slow).</li>
<li>Bugs, feature requests, and submitted patches are not tracked systematically. (This is partially dependent on <a href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/sysadmin/the-fsf-tech-team-doing-more-for-free-software">FSF/GNU infrastructure improvements</a> which are indefinitely delayed.)</li>
<li>There’s a history of releases breaking compatibility, and thus people are hesitant to upgrade. At the same time, Linux distributions actively want to force-upgrade everything they ship to ensure architecture support, leading to upstream/downstream friction.</li>
<li>Guide-level documentation is superficial and outdated.</li>
<li>Building an Autotools-based project directly from its VCS checkout is often significantly harder than building it from a tarball release, and may involve tracking down and installing any number of unusual tools.</li>
<li>The Autotools depend on other GNU software that is not actively maintained, most importantly GNU M4, and to a lesser extent GNU Make.</li>
<li>Coordination among the Autotools is weak, even though the tools are tightly coupled to each other. There are portions of codebases that exist solely for interoperability with other tools in the toolchain, which leads to overlapping maintainer and reviewer responsibility, slow code review and inconvenient copyright assignment processes multiplying, and causing confusion and dropped balls. For instance, there is code shared among Autoconf, Automake, and/or Gnulib by copying files between source repositories; changes to these files are extra inconvenient. The lack of coordination also makes it harder for tool maintainers to deprecate old functionality, or to decouple interfaces to make things more extensible; maintainers do not negotiate policies with each other to help. For instance, Autoconf has trouble knowing when it is safe to remove internal kludges that old versions of Automake depend on, and certain shell commands (e.g.&nbsp;aclocal) are distributed with one package but abstractly belong to another.</li>
<li>Division of labor among the Autotools, and the sources of third-party macros, is ad-hoc and unclear. (Which macros should be part of Autoconf proper? Which should be part of Gnulib? Which should be part of the Autoconf Macro Archive? Which should be shipped with Automake? Which tools should autoreconf know how to run? Etc.)</li>
<li>Automake and Libtool are not nearly as extensible as Autoconf is.</li>
<li>Unlike several competitors, Automake <em>only</em> works with Make, not with newer build drivers (e.g.&nbsp;Ninja).</li>
<li>Because Automake tries to generate Makefiles that will work with <em>any</em> Make implementation, the Makefiles it generates are much more complicated and slow than they would be if they took advantage of GNU and/or BSD extensions.</li>
<li>Libtool is notoriously slow, brittle, and difficult to modify (even worse than Autoconf proper). This is partially due to technical debt and partially due to maintaining support for completely obsolete platforms (e.g.&nbsp;old versions of AIX).</li>
<li>Libtool has opinions about the proper way to manage shared libraries that Linux distributions actively disagree with, forcing them to kludge around its code during package builds.</li>
<li>Alternatives…</li></ul></div></article></div></div>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Artificial Bodies and the Promise of Abstraction:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>A conversation with Peter Wolfendale</span></span></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></section><p><span><span><span><span><span>© Scott Eaton</span></span></span></span></span></p><div id="comp-kiemep60" data-testid="richTextElement"><p><span>Please can you start by saying a few things about the rise of embodiment within contemporary philosophy? It seems to me to be mainly used as a corrective against: 1) the Cartesian notion of an immaterial mind, and 2) the materialist tendency to place the mind in the brain. But what are the main positive claims that defenders of embodiment are making?&nbsp;</span></p>



<p>I think that the meaning of the term “embodiment” in philosophical circles is deceptively diverse, and that those who champion the concept are motivated by concerns that overlap less than is often appreciated. If they are unified by one thing, it is a rogues’ gallery of common enemies. Although Descartes is the most reviled of these, his errors are often traced back to some original sin perpetrated by Plato. However, in order to make sense of these conceptual crimes, it’s worth first distinguishing the <span>explanatory</span> concerns of cognitive science and artificial intelligence from the <span>normative </span>concerns of political and social theory, while acknowledging that both of these are downstream from more general <span>metaphysical</span> concerns regarding the difference and/or relation between matter and mind. So, though there are many purely metaphysical objections to the Platonic dualism of intelligible and sensible worlds, and the Cartesian dualism of mental and physical substances, what really unites the embodiment paradigm is their objection to the outsized role that Plato, Descartes, and their inheritors give to “the life of the mind” in explaining how we make our way in the world, and establishing which aspects of it we should value. For want of a better word, we might call this “intellectualism”.</p>



<p>This “life of the mind” is distinguished by the capacity for <span>abstract thought</span>. This is to say that it abstracts away from concrete features of the context in which thinking occurs: it is <span>theoretical</span>, or unconstrained by the practical problems posed by our bodily environment; and it is <span>contemplative</span>, or independent of the sensorimotor capacities through which we interact with this environment. Both Plato and Descartes take mathematics to exemplify this sort of thinking, and on that basis, thought <span>as such</span>. Mathematical theorems are not strictly about anything in our physical environment, and they can be verified even if they’re not applicable to it, in ways that needn’t involve interacting with it. This being said, what really distinguishes Descartes from Plato is his conviction that the physical world can be accurately <span>represented</span> by mathematical models, and thus that our experiences can be treated as internal representations akin to such models. There are other problematic aspects of the Cartesian picture, but this will do for now.</p></div><section id="comp-kiemep621"><div data-testid="columns"><div id="comp-kiemep64"><div data-mesh-id="comp-kiemep64inlineContent" data-testid="inline-content"><div data-mesh-id="comp-kiemep64inlineContent-gridContainer" data-testid="mesh-container-content"><p id="comp-kiemep661" data-testid="richTextElement"><h2><span>WHAT REALLY DISTINGUISHES DESCARTES FROM PLATO IS HIS CONVICTION THAT THE PHYSICAL WORLD CAN BE ACCURATELY REPRESENTED BY MATHEMATICAL MODELS</span></h2></p></div></div></div></div></section><div id="comp-kiemep68" data-testid="richTextElement"><p><span>So, what are the main explanatory objections to intellectualism?</span></p>



<p>There are two. On the one hand, its opponents claim that intellectualism ignores the vast majority of human cognition: most of our lives are spent carrying out tasks and navigating obstacles whose contours are determined by the way our body fits into its environment, rather than reasoning our way from premises to conclusions. Making a cup of tea in an unfamiliar kitchen is a more representative instance of our problem-solving capacity than demonstrating the infinity of primes. On the other, they claim that intellectualism has its priorities backwards: rather than treating this sort of “skilled coping” as a deficient form of abstract cognition, we can only understand the latter by showing how it emerges from the former. Even our ability to imagine complex geometric constructions has at some point been bootstrapped from a basic bodily grasp of orientation and gesture.</p>



<p>The most important targets of these complaints are the classical computational theory of mind in cognitive science and what gets called “good old-fashioned AI” (GOFAI). These see cognition as principally a matter of rule-governed symbol manipulation not unlike mathematical reasoning. They are opposed by a range of “4E perspectives”, so called because they emphasise some combination of the <span>embodied</span>, <span>embedded</span>, enactive, and <span>extended</span> dimensions of cognition. The extent to which these diverge from traditional views varies, but, in rough order, the points of contention are: 1) the extent to which cognition is dependent on features of the body outside of the brain (e.g., the structure of sensory organs), and features of the environment outside of the body (e.g., the availability of cognitive resources), 2) whether the concepts of computation and representation are irredeemably intellectualist (e.g., if they can account for pre-linguistic “meaning”), and 3) whether dependence implies constitution (e.g., if my notebook is part of my mind).</p>



<p><span>What about the normative objections?</span></p>



<p>Again, there are two. On the one hand, opponents claim that intellectualism reflects and reinforces implicit social hierarchies: those who have historically enjoyed the luxury of theoretical contemplation have done so because the practical problems and bodily processes it abstracts away from have been taken care of for them, often by groups who have been systematically <span>identified</span> with their bodies and bodily capacities, such as women, slaves, and colonised peoples. The disembodied Cartesian ego is an illusion engendered by ignorance and privilege. On the other, they claim that intellectualism devalues significant sources of human knowledge: there are forms of “lived experience” and “situated knowledge” that are valuable even if they aren’t (and possibly can’t be) articulated in a manner that divorces them from the embodied contexts in which they occur (e.g., their emotional valence). This Cartesian false-consciousness doesn’t simply impact the way we treat others, but even the way we treat ourselves, potentially disconnecting us from our embodied existence.</p>



<p>The idea that privileging the mind over the body is associated with other sorts of illicit privilege (e.g., economic, racial, sexual, etc.) is now fairly widespread in contemporary feminist and critical theory. However, there are a variety of philosophical frameworks drawn from the Continental tradition that get used to articulate, elaborate, and offer solutions to this problem. Roughly speaking, the main strands are Spinozist (Deleuze, Affect Theory, etc.), Nietzschean (Foucault, Butler, etc.), and phenomenological (Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, etc.), though there is much cross-pollination. The first is characterised by the metaphysical tenor of its critique, proposing some form of materialist monism as an alternative to the dualisms of Plato and Descartes. The second is characterised by its focus upon social dynamics, providing an analysis of the way bodies are “ensouled” by the internalisation of patterns of thought and action. But the last provides the greatest point of overlap with the explanatory concerns discussed above, as it provides a detailed introspective analysis of the body’s involvement in the constitution of experience. Phenomenology has had a marked influence on 4E approaches to cognition, and is responsible for the concept that straddles and sometimes connects all these varying concerns, namely, “the lived body”.</p></div><div id="comp-kiemep6b" data-testid="richTextElement"><p><span>The idea of the lived body suggests that the body is not just a causal bridge between ourselves and the world, but rather that the body is our engagement with the world in a way that serves as a condition for the emergence of our subjectivity. This suggests that only a “proper” body will be fit for this purpose – no ersatz or artificial alternative will do. Embodiment is in fact “real meat” embodiment. Is this a fair picture, both in phenomenology and in the other frameworks you discuss above?</span></p>



<p>Though not every proponent of embodiment will go so far as to insist on an essential link between mind and meat, I think it’s fair to say that this is where the rhetoric of embodiment leads. To some extent, this is because it aligns with other philosophical and political goals, such as undermining pernicious distinctions between human and animal or diagnosing dangerous fantasies implicit in the very suggestion that minds could be uploaded into computer simulations. However, there are some arguments for the claim, and I’ll try to tease out the general pattern of these as I see it. But first, it’s worth saying something more about the idea of the lived body.</p>



<p>The cornerstone of the phenomenological tradition is the idea that the<span> content</span> of explicitly articulated representations, such as declarative sentences or mathematical models, depends upon a more primitive form of <span>meaning</span> implicit in ordinary conscious experience. This gets formulated in slightly different ways by Husserl, Heidegger, and Merleau-Ponty, but they essentially agree that our many and varied representations are able to pick out the same <span>object</span> (e.g., galaxies, spleens, recessions) across changes in time, shifts in perspective, differences of opinion, and diverging interests, only because the referential frameworks they deploy (e.g., star charts, anatomy, econometrics), are so many layers arranged on top of those simple <span>unities</span> that tie together our everyday activities (e.g., places, obstacles, tools). My coffee cup is unified as something I can reach out and grasp, but this grasping is not a carefully planned sequence of muscle movements guided by a mechanical understanding of shapes and forces, it is a single fluid movement in which my fingers fit themselves to the cup’s contours without so much as a second thought. What distinguishes the “lived body” from the “biological body” is not simply that it is not yet an object of scientific representation, but rather that it is what ties everything together in the last instance. It is the <span>origin</span> of all intentional …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

This resulted in a decoupling of the two busbars in the Ernestinovo substation, which in turn separated North-West and south-east electric power flows in this substation. As shown in Figure 1 below, North-West bound lines which remained connected to one busbar, connect Ernestinovo to Zerjavinec (Croatia) and Pecs (Hungary), while South-East bound lines which remained connected to another busbar, connect Ernestinovo to Ugljevik (Bosnia-Herzegovina) and Sremska Mitrovica (Serbia).</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ca35232da145a366158c9b4df33d787e40d621c9/129ad/assets/graphics/uploads/system-separation-figure-2.jpg" alt="" title="Figure 1 - Decoupling of two busbars in Ernestinovo"></p><p><em>Figure 1 - Decoupling of two busbars in Ernestinovo</em></p><p>The separation of flows in the Ernestinovo substation, lead to the shifting of electric power flows to neighbouring lines which were subsequently overloaded.

At the same time, the frequency in the South-East Area initially increased up to 50.6 Hz before settling at a steady state frequency between 50.2 Hz and 50.3 Hz as illustrated in Figure 4 below:</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/af53041f1f9915046a980de1662f685154376b5c/670b8/assets/graphics/uploads/forth.png" alt="" title="Figure 4 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021 right after the disturbance and during resynchronisation"></p><p><em>Figure 4 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021 right after the disturbance and during resynchronisation</em></p><p>Due to the low frequency in the North-West Area, contracted interruptible services in France and Italy (in total around 1.7 GW) were disconnected in order to reduce the frequency deviation. These services are provided by large customers who are contracted by the respective Transmission System Operators (TSOs) to be disconnected if frequency drops under a certain threshold. In addition, 420 MW and 60 MW of supportive power were automatically activated from the Nordic and Great Britain synchronous areas respectively. These countermeasures ensured that already at 14:09 CET the frequency deviation from the nominal value of 50 Hz was reduced to around 0.1 Hz in the North-West area (Figure 4).</p><p>In order to reduce the high frequency in the South-East Area, automatic and manual countermeasures were activated, including the reduction of generation output (Eg. automatic disconnection of a 975 MW generator in Turkey at 14:04:57). As a consequence, the frequency in the South-East Area returned to 50.2 Hz at 14:29 CET and remained within control limits (49.8 and 50.2 Hz) until the resynchronisation of the two separated areas took place at 15:07:31.6 CET.</p><p>Between 14:30 CET and 15:06 CET the frequency in the South-East area was fluctuating between 49.9 Hz and 50.2 Hz due to the rather small size of the South-East Area where also several production units were disconnected (Figure 5). During this period, the frequency in the North-West Area fluctuated far less and remained close to the nominal value, due to the rather large size of the North-West Area. This frequency behaviour is a subject of further detailed investigation.</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/83de537eb517d8e18789e4116bb3561294bf39c8/a45a4/assets/graphics/uploads/graph_nw_se_03_1400h-1515h.jpg" alt="" title="Figure 5 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021 for the complete duration "></p><p><em>Figure 5 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021 for the complete duration</em></p><p>The automatic response and the coordinated actions taken by the TSOs in Continental Europe ensured that the situation was quickly restored close to normal operation. The contracted interruptible services in Italy and in France were reconnected at 14:47 CET and 14:48 CET respectively prior to the resynchronisation of the North-West and South-East areas at 15:08 CET.</p><p>ENTSO-E continues to keep the European Commission and the Electricity Coordination Group, composed of representatives of Member States, informed and updated with detailed results of the preliminary technical analyses.</p><p>Based on the preliminary technical analyses presented above, a formal investigation following the legal framework under the Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/1485 of 2 August 2017 (System Operation Guideline) will be established, whereby National Regulatory Authorities and ACER are invited to join with TSOs in an Expert Investigation Panel.</p><p>In line with the provisions of the mentioned Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/1485 of 2 August 2017, ENTSO-E will present the results of the investigation to the Electricity Coordination Group and will subsequently publish a report once the analysis is completed.</p><hr><p><strong>Note:</strong> All figures and details about the sequence of the events are still subject to final investigation and possible changes.</p><p><strong>Questions and answers</strong></p><p>What is a system separation?</p><p>The transmission grids of the countries of Continental Europe are electrically tied together to operate synchronously at the frequency of approximately 50 Hz. An event on 8 January 2021 caused the Continental Europe synchronous area to separate into two areas, with an area in the South-East of Europe being temporarily operating in separation from the rest of Continental Europe.</p><p>Is this the first time such an event happens in Continental Europe?</p><p>The Continental Europe synchronous area is one of the largest interconnected synchronous electricity systems in the world in terms of its size and number of supplied customers. Such a kind of event can happen in any electric power system. System resilience and preparedness of system operators in charge have a decisive impact on the consequences of such events. A separation of the synchronous area with a much larger disturbance and impacts on customers took place in Continental Europe on the 4 November 2006. This event was extensively analysed and led to a number of substantial developments, like the European Awareness System (EAS) which is a platform allowing TSOs to exchange operational information in real time, enabling them to react immediately in case of unusual system condition. The TSOs are therefore well prepared in order to coordinate and manage such events and limit the consequences. This preparedness and a permanent observation of the system frequency allowed to resynchronize the two separated areas in a very short period of time.</p><p>How are countermeasures coordinated in Continental Europe in case of frequency deviations?</p><p>In Continental Europe, procedures are in place to avoid system disturbances and especially large frequency deviations with the risk of uncoordinated disconnection of customers or generation. The TSOs Amprion (Germany) and Swissgrid (Switzerland) are responsible for these procedures in their role as synchronous area monitor (SAM) in Continental Europe. The SAM continuously monitors the system frequency. In case of large frequency deviations, they inform all TSOs via the European Awareness System (EAS) and launch an extraordinary procedure for frequency deviations to coordinate countermeasures in a fast and effective manner in order to stabilize the system. One step of this procedure is a telephone conference by Amprion, Swissgrid, RTE (France), Terna (Italy) and REE (Spain). This teleconference took place at 14:09 CET on 8 January 2021. In the telephone conference, the situation was evaluated, the TSOs informed about countermeasures which were already activated. The TSOs of the North-West and South-East Area also coordinated the actions for reconnection in order to reach one synchronous area in Continental Europe again.</p><p>Were end customers disconnected? Were there any other consequences?</p><p>Customers in the order of 70 MW in the North-East Area and in the order of 163 MW in the South-East Area were disconnected. Due to the high resilience of the interconnected network and the rapid response of European TSOs, the security of operation and electricity supply was not endangered further. An important contribution to stabilizing the system was delivered by the previously contracted interruptible services, which were activated in France and Italy. Such contracts which have been agreed with customers allow the TSO to temporarily and automatically reduce the electrical consumption depending on the situation with the electric power system in real-time.</p><p>What is an electrical busbar?</p><p>A busbar is an electrical junction in a substation, which connects overhead lines, cables and transformers through electrical switches. Usually, there are several busbars in a substation, which can be connected by a busbar coupler. Are there special devices protecting the equipment in a substation? Various devices protect the equipment in a substation. One of them is an overcurrent protection relay, disconnecting automatically the equipment (Eg. overhead line or cable) if the electrical …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>Most of the 300,000 + plant species have leaves, and the function of all of them is to perform photosynthesis.&nbsp; They are the ultimate source for all of the oxygen and food for the rest of the food chain and help regulate the global carbon and water cycles.&nbsp; They are also nutrition superstars.&nbsp; To figure out why greens are good for you and whether all leaves are equal in this regard, we need to take quick look at global leaf structural variability and broad evolutionary patterns in the species that make their way onto our tables.<span id="more-937"></span></p>

<p>Across the global flora leaves are extraordinarily structurally variable.&nbsp; They vary in size from a tiny duckweed leaf to a huge palm frond, and in thickness from a thin lettuce leaf to a thick leaf of a succulent aloe or pine needle.&nbsp; We don’t fully understand yet why leaves are so structurally variable across species. My colleagues and I <a title="Osnas et al. Science 2013" href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2013/03/27/science.1231574" target="_blank">recently published a paper</a> demonstrating that across the global flora leaf nutrient concentrations and physiological rates of maximum photosynthetic carbon gain and respiratory carbon loss change in proportion to leaf area more strongly than they change in proportion to leaf mass.&nbsp; We demonstrate the consequences of this area-proportionality of leaf traits for how we measure, analyze and use these leaf traits in models of the global carbon cycle.</p>

<p>Of relevance here, however, is that the high area-proportionality of leaf traits simply means that the parts of the leaf that are most beneficial for humans (digestible protein, vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, digestible fiber) are likely proportional in many species to the leaf’s photosynthetic apparatus, which is clustered in a relatively thin band of cells beneath the epidermis (see image). &nbsp;Adding thickness to a leaf doesn’t necessarily add nutritious tissue and might instead add mostly fibrous, indigestible structural material (see agave photo below). &nbsp;This does not mean that the thinner the leaf, the more nutritious it is; this is just a general tendency across all plants. &nbsp;Scaled up to the level of the whole plant, though, we see that leaves have the highest ratio of nutritious material (digestible protein, vitamins and minerals, fiber) to indigestible material (for most species). &nbsp;Some fruits probably come close, but fruit is rare, and leaves are abundant.</p>

<p>One of the key variables modulating area- vs mass-proportionality of leaf traits is leaf mass per unit leaf area (LMA), which increases with leaf thickness and density. &nbsp;Lettuce leaves have very low LMA, pine needles and holly leaves have high LMA.&nbsp; Although there is very little data on the subject, the leaves that we eat tend to fall on the low end of the global LMA spectrum, shown here for a global dataset of more than 2500 wild species.</p>

<p>Leaf tenderness—reducing LMA–is certainly a trait that has undergone selection in cultivated varieties.&nbsp; In species with varietals that have undergone selection on different structures, the varieties in which selection has been directed at the leaves invariably have more tender, less bitter, and larger leaves than do varieties in which selection has been directed at different structures, such as the roots.&nbsp; For example, chard has larger and more tender greens than do beets (both <i>Beta vulgaris</i>, Caryophyllales); celery grown for stalks and leaves is more tender than the aboveground portion of the celery varietal grown for its root (both <i>Apium graveolens</i>, Apiales); and Siberian kale varieties have more tender leaves than do rutabaga varieties (both <i>Brassica napus</i>, Brassicales).</p>

<p>Kale and collards, grown for their leaves, have leaves that are more tender than those of conspecific <i>Brassica oleracea</i> grown primarily for other structures:&nbsp; kohlrabi, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts (and for those of you keeping track at home, in the <a title="The extraordinary diversity of Brassica&nbsp;oleracea" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/05/the-extraordinary-diversity-of-brassica-oleracea/" target="_blank"><i>B. oleracea</i></a>, <a title="Thanksgiving turnips and the diversity of the genus&nbsp;Brassica" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/598/" target="_blank"><i>Brassica</i></a>, and<a title="The most political vegetables: A whirlwind tour of the edible&nbsp;crucifers" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/the-most-political-vegetables-a-whirlwind-tour-of-the-edible-crucifers/" target="_blank"> Brassicaceae posts</a>,<i> </i>I erroneously lumped all kales into <i>Brassica oleracea</i>—<a title="Brassica napus kales" href="http://seedambassadors.org/Mainpages/still/napuskale/napuskale.htm" target="_blank">some of them are <i>B. napus</i></a>, including my favorite variety: Red Russian kale).&nbsp; Don’t dare throw out your beet, celeriac, rutabaga or <i>B. oleracea </i>greens, though, if you’re lucky enough to get them—they need a bit more cooking or tenderizing, but they’re still delicious and nutritious.&nbsp; At least put your celery root greens in stock.&nbsp; LMA also varies within a varietal based on growing conditions.&nbsp; Leaves grown in sun have higher LMA than leaves grown in shade.&nbsp; The impact of growing conditions within species, however, will have to wait for another time.</p>
<p>LMA is hardly the only determinant of which species make it onto our plates.&nbsp; Otherwise, we’d have our pick of hundreds of species on the low-LMA end of the global curve.&nbsp; Instead, we can put most of our greens species on a fairly legible phylogenetic tree in need of only a few disclaimer paragraphs of omissions.</p>

<p>Like many phylogenetic trees of more than a handful of species, this tree of our “greens species” commits sins of both commission and omission in the interest of producing a readable image. Omission because the species on the tree do not comprise an exhaustive list of species whose leaves people around the globe regularly consume. Commission because I included a few unusual items, such as sweet potato leaves (<i>Ipomoea</i>, Solanales), and pea shoots (Fabales), and a few taxa are single representatives of a large group.&nbsp; Sister to sweet potato on the tree, for example, is the entire family Lamiaceae, the mints.</p>

<p>We mostly use leaves from the mints as herbs and spices:&nbsp; peppermint and spearmint (<i>Mentha </i>sp.), basil (<i>Ocimum</i> sp.), thyme (<i>Thymus</i> sp.), oregano and marjoram (<i>Origanum</i> sp.), rosemary (<i>Rosmarinus</i> sp.), lemon balm (<i>Melissa</i> sp.), lavender (<i>Lavandula</i> sp.), shiso (<i>Perilla frutescens</i>), bee balm (<i>Monarda</i> sp.), and mountain mint (<i>Pycnanthemum</i> sp.).&nbsp; Also, scallions are the only representatives on the tree from the genus <i>Allium</i> in the monocot order Asparagles, which includes many edible species, the leaves of some of which are regularly employed:&nbsp; garlic, <a title="A look at&nbsp;leeks" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2013/03/03/a-look-at-leeks/" target="_blank">leeks</a>, ramps, and onions.</p>
<p>I included some of the more exotic greens in the greens tree both to avoid rousing the ire of their champions and because I was a bit shocked that some large, charismatic orders that feature prominently in the diet at large are reduced to single entries on the greens tree or are gone altogether, meaning we primarily use roots, stems, fruits or seeds from these clades, not leaves.&nbsp; Granted, this “greens tree” is mostly a tree of “greens obtained from Whole Foods and summer farmer’s markets in the continental United States.”</p>

<p>I’ve included a few weedy, wild things that I pick regularly and that one can actually occasionally pay money for at the farmer’s market:&nbsp; nettle (<i>Urtica dioica</i>, Rosales), chickweed (<i>Stellaria media</i>, Caryophyllales), miner’s lettuce (<i>Claytonia perfoliata</i>, Caryophyllales), purslane (<i>Portulaca oleracea</i>, Caryophyllales), and dandelion (<i>Taraxacum officinale</i>, Asterales).&nbsp; Largely, however, I’ve omitted species whose leaves are technically edible, at least in small doses at some point in their life cycle, but that are reduced to curiosities at the modern American table, not staples.&nbsp; Therefore, please hold your fire if you’re shaking your fist at the tree because it omits the young beech (<i>Fagus grandifolia</i>, Fagales), sassafras (<i>Sassafras albidum</i>, Laureles), or violet (<i>Viola odorata</i>, Malpighiales) leaves you like to nibble on when you hike east of the Mississippi. Fern fiddlehead (assorted Polypodiales) enthusiasts, too, forgive me. &nbsp;We use some leaves to prepare other food: &nbsp;banana leaves and corn husks to wrap&nbsp;<em>tamales</em>, and palm fronds and fig leaves to wrap fish for baking or grilling. &nbsp;I salute these leaves, but they’re not on the tree. &nbsp;Some are gone simply because I didn’t have room, such as many of the <a title="The most political vegetables: A whirlwind tour of the edible&nbsp;crucifers" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/the-most-political-vegetables-a-whirlwind-tour-of-the-edible-crucifers/">crucifer greens</a>, and asterids chrysanthemum, borage and comfrey (although those last two haven’t been placed to order yet and would therefore have been difficult to place within the asterids anyway).</p>

                    <p>An alarm clock for the rest of us</p><p>It’s a brand new year, which means I should really start writing a new post.
I’ve been wanting to for a while, but we’ve been in lockdown for two months now and Google Analytics is the only indication that I’m not alone on the planet, and most of that is bots anyway.
I’ve decided to take a page out of the book of my friend, <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/">James Stanley</a>, who both does cool things <em>and</em> actually writes about them, so I’m starting to document all my projects again.</p>
<p>Given my non-frenetic, slow-paced lifestyle, I’ve long had a non-burning need.
I don’t use an alarm to wake up, as I start work late, but I still want to know what time it is when I wake up, just to see if it’s way too early and I can go to sleep again.
A few days a week I have tennis and need to get up early, but if it’s windy or rainy or very cold, the practice gets canceled and I want to know before I’m awake enough to not be able to go to sleep again.</p>
<p>To accommodate this lifestyle, I’ve traditionally turned to my mobile phone, but that has some disadvantages.
Namely, the screen is too bright and wakes me up when I check the time, and I’m too obsessive to not check all my messages instead of falling asleep when I see the notifications on the screen.
I’ve long thought that a bedside alarm clock would be perfect for me, but I couldn’t find one that fulfilled all my requirements:</p>
<!-- break -->

<ul>
<li>I needed something that had a screen that would always be always lit, so I could check the time with one eye and half a brain awake, in the complete darkness of the bedroom.</li>
<li>A screen that wasn’t too bright and wouldn’t disturb sleep, but that would also be legible in direct sunlight, so I could see the time during the day.
This meant adaptive brightness.</li>
<li>Octagonal shape so I can lay it down on its side (or at 45°) instead of having to crane my neck up to check the time when lying down (I really did think of everything).</li>
<li>Weather forecast for the next hour or two, so I can reliably fail to wake up for tennis when not necessary.</li>
<li>Annoying beeper for alarms.</li>
<li>Less annoying built-in LEDs that would increase in brighness for a few minutes before an alarm went off, so I can wake up less annoyed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the result:</p>
<div><p><a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/glamorshot2.jpg" data-lightbox="gallery"><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/glamorshot2-small.jpg"></a></p><p><span>Look at this sexy thing.</span></p></div><p>Sexy.</p>
<h2>Designing this thing</h2>
<p>Conceptually, making an alarm clock to fulfill these requirements isn’t hard.
You take a small OLED screen, an ESP8266, connect them together, add some LEDs and a buzzer, and you’re done!
Since the hardware was more-or-less straightforward, I started with designing the octagonal case:</p>
<div><p><a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/clock-back.png" data-lightbox="gallery"><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/clock-back-small.png"></a></p><p><span>The back of the clock.</span></p></div><p>The OLED screen has four mounting holes, so I designed the mount around them.
For the ESP8266, I use a WeMos D1 Mini board, as it’s quite small and nice to work with.
I initially thought I’d have to connect the WeMos to the four pins of the screen with wires, but I discovered that if you kinda squint, you can get four of the ESP8266’s pins to match up with the screen’s pins and in the correct order, which means I could solder the ESP8266 behind the screen module directly, which simplified the wiring by a lot.</p>
<div><p><a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/mockup.jpg" data-lightbox="gallery"><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/mockup-small.jpg"></a></p><p><span>Look at that subtle off-white coloring.</span></p></div><p>While designing the clock, I created a quick mockup of the screen as I wanted it to show.
I decided I wanted the hour to be displayed in as big letters as possible, since this screen is small, and the other elements I wanted were wind speed, temperature and weather forecast for the next hour.</p>
<p>The other components left to add were a photoresistor (for sensing ambient light), a buzzer and a LED strip.
They were all straightforward to add, the resistor is connected to the ESP8266’s analog pin, and the buzzer and LED strip to some other free pins.</p>
<h2>The software</h2>
<p>The software was the slightly trickier part in this build, although that was pretty straightforward too.
I needed multiple components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting the time somehow (there’s no real-time clock on the ESP8266 and I didn’t want to add one).</li>
<li>Dimming the screen in a pleasing manner.</li>
<li>Getting the weather forecast and current weather.</li>
<li>Connecting to WiFi and autoupdating.</li>
<li>Annoying me into wakefulness in a satisfactory manner.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The clock</h3>
<p>There’s an old Chinese saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>To know the time, you must first connect to the internet.</p>

<p>Luckily, connecting to the Internet is very easy with tzapu’s <a href="https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager">excellent WiFiManager</a> library.
The clock creates an access point, you join it with your phone or computer, give it your WiFi network’s password, and you’re done.</p>
<p>After connecting, an NTP library can fetch the time every so often from the closest server, so the clock is always up to date.
It was important to me that this clock is solid enough to trust with my most important wake-up alarms, and it achieves this goal admirably (unless the internet connection is down).</p>
<p>That also takes care of autoupdates, since I have a simple, secure autoupdate machine I set up using <a href="https://gitlab.com/stavros/espota-server">ESPOTA-server, an autoupdate server I wrote for the ESP8266</a>.
The clock checks for a new update every day, and automatically downloads and installs it.
This way, distributing updates will work reliably, even to millions of devices, for when you realize that collecting all the users’ personal data is slightly monetizable.</p>
<h3>The dimming</h3>
<p>After a bit (or a lot) of searching, I finally found how to dim the OLED screen, and another important feature was well on the way of being implemented.
Because it was rather hard to find, I’ll post the code here, along with the appropriate SEO keyword for people to be able to find it.
Here is the code for dimming an SSD1306-compatible, I2C 128x64 OLED screen:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>void</span> <span>brightnessTask</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>brightness</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Set the brightness of the SSD1306 OLED screen with this hack.</span>
    <span>// From https:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFpXfSnDNSY.</span>
    <span>// `brightness` should be a value between 5 (for some reason) and 255.</span>
    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>SSD1306_SETCONTRAST</span><span>);</span> <span>//0x81</span>
    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>brightness</span><span>);</span>

    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>SSD1306_SETPRECHARGE</span><span>);</span> <span>//0xD9</span>
    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>

    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>SSD1306_SETVCOMDETECT</span><span>);</span> <span>//0xDB</span>
    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Once I discovered that, the rest of the dimming was easy:
I would just read the ambient light from the photoresistor and set the screen’s brightness according to the photoresistor’s value.</p>
<p>Another job <del>well</del> done.</p>
<h3>The weather</h3>
<div><p><a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/glamorshot1.jpg" data-lightbox="gallery"><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/glamorshot1-small.jpg"></a></p><p><span>What a beauty.</span></p></div><p>Getting the weather was easier than I thought.
<a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeather</a> has a simple API, which accepts a pair of coordinates and gives you the current weather and forecast for that location.
It only took a few minutes to fetch that data on the clock, and then I spent some time positioning them on the screen and turning the forecast into an appropriate icon so it could be displayed on the small screen.</p>
<p>To display the icons, I used <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library/overview">Adafruit’s always helpful GFX library</a> and converted the OpenWeather icons to a format more suitable for display on a monochrome screen.
This took a bit of trial and error, as I wanted the icons to be easily distinguishable at a glance, even though their size was 12x12 pixels and just one color.
In the end, I think they worked out well, as it’s easy to tell if it’s raining or not.</p>
<h3>The wakefulness</h3>
<p>So the initial plan here was to have a buzzer buzz loudly and annoyingly in an attempt to wake me up.
However, I am a pretty light sleeper, and I hate loud and annoying sounds (surprisingly), so I wanted this to be a last resort.
The solution I came up with here is the following:</p>
<p>Say I want to set the alarm for 9:30, just in time to be ten minutes late for tennis.
The LEDs would start glowing very faintly at 9:20, slowly increasing in intensity over the next ten minutes, at which point they’d reach maximum.
If I still wasn’t up by then, the buzzer would begin beeping at the top of its lung, hopefully waking me up reliably.
This seemed like a pretty good algorithm, and one that would both wake me up pleasantly and reliably.</p>
<p>There was only one problem:
The clock doesn’t have any buttons or controls or any way for me to enter the alarm time.
I could create a web server where I could configure alarms, but I figured I’d rather get a rooster instead, so I did neither and just made an alarm clock that cannot alarm.
This symbolizes the futility of human existence and its incessant search for meaning in a cold and unfeeling universe that’s ultimately profoundly devoid of such, and then you die.</p>
<p>Not having to wake up to a buzzer is cool, though.</p>
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>Overall, I’m pretty happy with this clock!
I can now open an eyelid, look at the time and fall asleep again, which is a massive quality-of-life improvement over the previous “fuck sleep I’ve got Instagram likes” situation.
The octagonal shape is a killer feature, I keep the clock angled 45° (as in the photo) and it really is the perfect angle for reading it while lying down.</p>
<p>One thing I’d like to improve in the future is to add a battery, because right now it’s solely USB powered and will obviously die if there’s a power outage. Adding a small LiPo battery and a charger circuit will be pretty easy and will ensure that the clock can keep running for hours even without power.</p>
<p>The source code is here:</p>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/stavros/do-not-be-alarmed">https://gitlab.com/stavros/do-not-be-alarmed</a></p>
<p>It’s not very complete, so use it at your own risk, and I haven’t really added deployment details, but it should be very easy to build with one PlatformIO command.</p>

							<p><em>TLDR: DuckDB now has full-text search functionality, similar to the FTS5 extension in SQLite. The main difference is that our FTS extension is fully formulated in SQL. We tested it out on TREC disks 4 and 5.</em></p>

<p>Searching through textual data stored in a database can be cumbersome, as SQL does not provide a good way of formulating questions such as “Give me all the documents about <strong>Mallard Ducks</strong>”: string patterns with <code>LIKE</code> will only get you so far. Despite SQL’s shortcomings here, storing textual data in a database is commonplace. Consider the table <code>products (id INT, name VARCHAR, description VARCHAR</code>) - it would be useful to search through the <code>name</code> and <code>description</code> columns for a website that sells these products.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>We expect a search engine to return us results within milliseconds. For a long time databases were unsuitable for this task, because they could not search large inverted indices at this speed: transactional database systems are not made for this use case. However, analytical database systems, can keep up with state-of-the art information retrieval systems. The company <a href="https://www.spinque.com/">Spinque</a> is a good example of this. At Spinque, MonetDB is used as a computation engine for customized search engines.</p>

<p>DuckDB’s FTS implementation follows the paper “<a href="https://hannes.muehleisen.org/SIGIR2014-column-stores-ir-prototyping.pdf">Old Dogs Are Great at New Tricks</a>”. A keen observation there is that advances made to the database system, such as parallelization, will speed up your search engine “for free”!</p>

<p>Alright, enough about the “why”, let’s get to the “how”.</p>

<h3 id="preparing-the-data">Preparing the Data</h3>
<p>The TREC 2004 Robust Retrieval Track has 250 “topics” (search queries) over TREC disks 4 and 5. The data consist of many text files stored in SGML format, along with a corresponding DTD (document type definition) file. This format is rarely used anymore, but it is similar to XML. We will use OpenSP’s command line tool <code>osx</code> to convert it to XML. Because there are many files, I wrote a bash script:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>
<span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> latimes/xml
<span>for </span>i <span>in</span> <span>$(</span><span>seq</span> <span>-w</span> 1 9<span>)</span>
<span>do
        </span><span>cat </span>dtds/la.dtd latimes-<span>$i</span> | osx <span>&gt;</span> latimes/xml/latimes-<span>$i</span>.xml
<span>done</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This sorts the <code>latimes</code> files. Repeat for the <code>fbis</code>, <code>cr</code>, <code>fr94</code>, and <code>ft</code> files.</p>

<p>To parse the XML I used BeautifulSoup. Each document has a <code>docno</code> identifier, and a <code>text</code> field. Because the documents do not come from the same source, they differ in what other fields they have. I chose to take all of the fields.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>duckdb</span>
<span>import</span> <span>multiprocessing</span>
<span>import</span> <span>pandas</span> <span>as</span> <span>pd</span>
<span>import</span> <span>re</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now that we have a dataframe, we can register it in DuckDB.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># create database connection and register the dataframe
</span><span>con</span> <span>=</span> <span>duckdb</span><span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>database</span><span>=</span><span>'db/trec04_05.db'</span><span>,</span> <span>read_only</span><span>=</span><span>False</span><span>)</span>
<span>con</span><span>.</span><span>register</span><span>(</span><span>'documents_df'</span><span>,</span> <span>documents_df</span><span>)</span>

<span># create a table from the dataframe so that it persists
</span><span>con</span><span>.</span><span>execute</span><span>(</span><span>"CREATE TABLE documents AS (SELECT * FROM documents_df)"</span><span>)</span>
<span>con</span><span>.</span><span>close</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This is the end of my preparation script, so I closed the database connection.</p>

<h3 id="building-the-search-engine">Building the Search Engine</h3>
<p>We can now build the inverted index and the retrieval model using a <code>PRAGMA</code> statement. The extension is <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/full_text_search">documented here</a>. We create an index table on table <code>documents</code> or <code>main.documents</code> that we created with our script. The column that identifies our documents is called <code>docno</code>, and we wish to create an inverted index on the fields supplied. I supplied all fields by using the ‘*’ shortcut.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>con</span> <span>=</span> <span>duckdb</span><span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>database</span><span>=</span><span>'db/trec04_05.db'</span><span>,</span> <span>read_only</span><span>=</span><span>False</span><span>)</span>
<span>con</span><span>.</span><span>execute</span><span>(</span><span>"PRAGMA create_fts_index('documents', 'docno', '*', stopwords='english')"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Under the hood, a parameterized SQL script is called. The schema <code>fts_main_documents</code> is created, along with tables <code>docs</code>, <code>terms</code>, <code>dict</code>, and <code>stats</code>, that make up the inverted index. If you’re curious what this look like, take a look at our source code under the <code>extension</code> folder in DuckDB’s source code!</p>

<h3 id="running-the-benchmark">Running the Benchmark</h3>
<p>The data is now fully prepared. Now we want to run the queries in the benchmark, one by one. We load the topics file as follows:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># the 'topics' file is not structured nicely, therefore we need parse some of it using regex
</span><span>def</span> <span>after_tag</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>,</span> <span>tag</span><span>):</span>
    <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>findall</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>'&lt;'</span> <span>+</span> <span>tag</span> <span>+</span> <span>r</span><span>'&gt;([\s\S]*?)&lt;.*&gt;'</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>m</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>].</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>''</span><span>).</span><span>strip</span><span>()</span>

<span>topic_dict</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>with</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>'../../trec/topics'</span><span>,</span> <span>'r'</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span>
    <span>bs_content</span> <span>=</span> <span>bs</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>(),</span> <span>"lxml"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>top</span> <span>in</span> <span>bs_content</span><span>.</span><span>findChildren</span><span>(</span><span>'top'</span><span>):</span>
        <span>top_content</span> <span>=</span> <span>top</span><span>.</span><span>getText</span><span>()</span>
        <span># we need the number and title of each topic
</span>        <span>num</span> <span>=</span> <span>after_tag</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>top</span><span>),</span> <span>'num'</span><span>).</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>' '</span><span>)[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span>
        <span>title</span> <span>=</span> <span>after_tag</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>top</span><span>),</span> <span>'title'</span><span>)</span>
        <span>topic_dict</span><span>[</span><span>num</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>title</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This gives us a dictionary that has query number as keys, and query strings as values, e.g. <code>301 -&gt; 'International Organized Crime'</code>.</p>

<p>We want to store the results in a specific format, so that they can be evaluated by <a href="https://github.com/usnistgov/trec_eval.git">trec eval</a>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># create a prepared statement to make querying our document collection easier

        SELECT docno, score
        FROM scored_docs
        WHERE score IS NOT NULL
        ORDER BY score DESC
        LIMIT 1000)
    """</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>Now that we have created our ‘results’ file, we can compare them to the relevance assessments <code>qrels</code> using <code>trec_eval</code>.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>./trec_eval <span>-m</span> P.30 <span>-m</span> map qrels results
map                     all 0.2324
P_30                    all 0.2948
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Not bad! While these results are not as high as the reproducible by <a href="https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/regressions-robust04.md">Anserini</a>, they are definitely acceptable. The difference in performance can be explained by differences in</p>
<ol>
  <li>Which stemmer was used (we used ‘porter’)</li>
  <li>Which stopwords were used (we used the list of 571 English stopwords used in the SMART system)</li>
  <li>Pre-processing (removal of accents, punctuation, numbers)</li>
  <li>BM25 parameters (we used the default k=1.2 and b=0.75, non-conjunctive)</li>
  <li>Which fields were indexed (we used all columns by supplying ‘*’)</li>
</ol>

<p>Retrieval time for each query was between 0.5 and 1.3 seconds on our machine, which will be improved with further improvements to DuckDB. I hope you enjoyed reading this blog, and become inspired to test out the extension as well!</p>

							<p>Today, the Norwegian Data Protection Authority issued an advance notification of a 100 million NOK (€ 9 600 000) fine to the dating app Grindr, as a result of a legal complaint filed by the Norwegian Consumer Council. </p><p>- This is a milestone in the ongoing work to ensure that consumers’ privacy is protected online. The Data Protection Authority (Datatilsynet) has clearly established that it is unacceptable for companies to collect and share personal data without user´s permission, Finn Myrstad, director of digital policy in the Norwegian Consumer Council said.</p>
<p>In 2020, the Norwegian Consumer Council <a href="https://www.forbrukerradet.no/side/new-study-the-advertising-industry-is-systematically-breaking-the-law/">revealed how many apps collect and share large amounts of sensitive information</a> without users’ knowledge. Based on these findings, the Consumer Council filed legal complaints, together with&nbsp;noyb, the European Center for Digital Right,&nbsp;against the dating app Grindr and five commercial partners for breaches of the&nbsp;General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>The Data Protection Authority has now upheld the Consumer Council’s&nbsp;complaint&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.datatilsynet.no/en/news/2021/intention-to-issue--10-million-fine-to-grindr-llc/">issued an advance notification of a 100 million NOK&nbsp;</a>(€ 9 600 000)&nbsp;one-time&nbsp;administrative&nbsp;fine, which amounts to 10 percent of Grindr’s global annual revenue.&nbsp;Grindr has until February 15th&nbsp;to provide comments or remarks&nbsp;on the decision.</p>

<p>-  This is excellent news and sends a clear signal that it’s illegal to monitor consumers without their consent 24/7 to collect and share their data. The GDPR does have teeth and consumer groups stand ready to act against those who break the law, Monique Goyens, Director General of The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC), said.</p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">– The message is simple: ‘take it or leave it’ is not consent. If you rely on unlawful ‘consent’ you are subject to a hefty fine.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The decision from the Norwegian Data Protection Authority&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">rules</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;that Grind</span><span data-contrast="auto">r</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;users were not given sufficient information about how personal data was collected and shared onward&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">with</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;third part</span><span data-contrast="auto">y companies</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">Consumers&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">had to accept data sharing with third parties in order to use the app.</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">–&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">It is&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">great</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;that the Norwegian Data Protection A</span><span data-contrast="auto">u</span><span data-contrast="auto">thority&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">is taking</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;a lead</span><span data-contrast="auto">ing</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;role in enforcing the General Data Protection Regulation in Europe.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">–&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">There are many examples of how&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">personal data is used to manipulate everything from elections to targeting gambling ads against individuals struggling with addiction.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Lately, there’s been renewed interest in clean, simple technology
built to help us focus. Protocols like <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/">Gemini</a> strip away
the chaos of the web. Hardware hackers fit screens in
<a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://onezero.medium.com/smarter-mirrors-and-how-theyre-made-327997b9eff7">mirrors</a> and build beautiful minimalist displays to
<a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://onezero.medium.com/the-morning-paper-revisited-35b407822494">read the news</a>, display data neatly in a <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://onezero.medium.com/meet-accent-352cfa95813a">picture
frame</a>, or provide a <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://healeycodes.com/hacking-together-an-e-ink-dashboard/">daily summary</a>. Hidden amongst
these many awesome projects is the <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://remarkable.com/">reMarkable 2</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve been using the reMarkable for the past month or so and it is a
seriously solid device. I use it mainly to take notes, at which it
excels. The e-ink display is the best I have ever seen, barely ever
refreshing the entire screen and almost entirely without the temporary
artifacts that plague similar devices. The pencil is comfortable to
use – slightly fuzzy – and, interestingly, entirely passive: it never
needs to charge. Given that it’s meant to replace your paper, it
shouldn’t be too surprising that the tablet’s also incredibly thin.</p>
<h2 id="cornellnotes"><a href="#cornellnotes" aria-label="Anchor link for: cornellnotes">##
</a>
cornellNotes</h2>
<p>In one of my classes, I’m required to take Cornell notes. On what may
be a related note, it’s a terrible class. Regardless, I need to get an
A and so notes I shall take. The reMarkable comes with a built-in
Cornell notes template. It’s slightly different than the format I’m
used to, but it fits the bill well enough.</p>
<p>It’s hard to describe the experience of using the device. I would
say that it feels shockingly natural. Using it to take notes feels
like writing on a clipboard with none of the usual annoyances – the
paper sliding, having finite pages; and all the benefits of a digital
device – sending files via email, OCR, a select-and-drag tool, etc.
It’s convenient, feels nice, and performs well. Most importantly, it
makes me <em>excited</em> to use it every time I turn it on.</p>
<h2 id="worksheet"><a href="#worksheet" aria-label="Anchor link for: worksheet">##
</a>
workSheet</h2>
<p>In another class, the instructor distributes worksheets every once in
a while to complete during class. Now that we’re in distance learning
due to COVID, these are <code>pdf</code>s – perfect for use with the reMarkable.</p>
<p>I download them onto my laptop, upload them through the app, and
voila. Look Mom, no scratch paper! I can write directly on the
worksheet. I’ve only started doing it this week, and it’s amazing.
Sure, there are programs on the computer that allow you to write
on a <code>pdf</code>, but doing math with a trackpad sounds like torture. With
the reMarkable, it’s enjoyable.</p>
<p>That’s the device’s biggest impact. I used to hate writing by hand.
I would beg my teachers to let me type assignments so I didn’t have
to use a pencil – what am I, a caveman? Now, my paper has superpowers.</p>
<h2 id="notkindle"><a href="#notkindle" aria-label="Anchor link for: notkindle">##
</a>
notKindle</h2>
<p>It’s also a suprisingly good reading device, with native support for
<code>epub</code>s and <code>pdf</code>s. It doesn’t have a backlight, but to be fair
neither do actual books so I’m not too bothered. The default font size
is quite large, and the UI is really minimal which makes for peaceful,
undistracted reading. I own two Kindles already, but I’ve taken to
using the reMarkable instead for a number of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>There’s no ads or tracking. On Kindle there’s an ad on the bottom
of the homescreen, which expands to the whole screen when you turn it
off – plus it sends every move you make to live forever with Big Papa
Bezos. Not so with the reMarkable.</li>
<li>The screen on the reMarkable is physically larger. Though sometimes
the compact size of my Kindle comes in handy, like when traveling,
having a nice big display is definitely an advantage. My Kindle is
closer to a large phone, and the reMarkable is definitely a tablet.</li>
<li>The reMarkable is a fairly open device. The Kindle, on the other
hand, is locked down and dripping with DRM (fairly easy to break but
still an encumberance).</li>
</ol>
<p>The developers have also made a browser extension for Chromium-based
browsers called <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/read-on-remarkable/bfhkfdnddlhfippjbflipboognpdpoeh">Read on reMarkable</a>, which I would love to see
the insides of but is unfortunately closed-source. Basically, it takes
any webpage, turns it into an <code>epub</code>, and sends it off to your device.
I love it and use it near constantly: whenever I run into anything on
HN that is either really long, or I just want to save for later, I
hit a button and it sends it to the tablet. Again, just incredibly
convenient.</p>
<h2 id="jailbreak"><a href="#jailbreak" aria-label="Anchor link for: jailbreak">##
</a>
jailBreak</h2>
<p>This section is titled “jailbreak,” which is actually a bit of
misnomer because the reMarkable runs Linux and you can <code>ssh</code> into it
with ease. It’s also not too fitting because I’m not just going to
talk about modifying the device, but also about official accessories.
My device came with a <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2/folios">Book Folio</a> and <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2/markers">Marker</a> in the
box, which is pretty good value. I did find out while writing this
that they offer a “Marker Plus” that comes with a built-in eraser. It
is, unfortunately, out of stock currently but I plan on buying it once
it returns in “January 2021,” so supposedly sometime in the next week
or so.</p>
<p>Ok now time for the jailbreak-y stuff. There’s an active community on
Freenode, an unofficial <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://remarkablewiki.com/">wiki</a>, and an <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/reHackable/awesome-reMarkable">Awesome list</a>.
All of these are really great resources for cool stuff you can do with
your device, and I’m planning to begin experimenting with them in the
coming weeks. My first goal is to get <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/koreader/koreader">KOReader</a> running so I
can sync my extensive Calibre library to the device. I’m going to
avoid adding any <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/reHackable/awesome-reMarkable#games">games</a> so as not to add additional complexity
to a device that aims to remove distractions, and proceed slowly so I
don’t brick my fancy new toy. Stick around to see how that goes.</p>
<h2 id="ps"><a href="#ps" aria-label="Anchor link for: ps">##
</a>
pS</h2>
<p>The recently published fairly viral <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://surma.dev/things/ditherpunk/index.html">Ditherpunk article</a>
by <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://surma.dev/">Surma</a> gives a really interesting overview of image
dithering. After reading the article, I noticed that the reMarkable
itself uses dithering to “fade off” your writing and make it look
like pencil. Neat.</p>
<p>Also, comparing the reMarkable to the Kindle makes me want to
jailbreak that too – I’ll find some time to look into that soon.</p>

            <div>
                


<div>
<p>- Our preliminary conclusion is that Grindr has shared user data to a number of third parties without legal basis, said Bjørn Erik Thon, Director-General of the Norwegian Data Protection Authority.</p>
<p>Grindr is a location-based social networking app for gay, bi, trans, and queer people. In 2020, <a href="https://www.forbrukerradet.no/side/complaints-against-grindr-and-five-third-party-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Norwegian Consumer Council filed a complaint against Grindr</a> claiming unlawful sharing of personal data with third parties for marketing purposes. The data shared include GPS location, user profile data, and the fact that the user in question is on Grindr.</p>
<p>Our preliminary conclusion is that Grindr needs consent to share these personal data and that Grindr’s consents were not valid. Additionally, we believe that the fact that someone is a Grindr user speaks to their sexual orientation, and therefore this constitutes special category data that merit particular protection.</p>
<p>- The Norwegian Data Protection Authority considers that this is a serious case. Users were not able to exercise real and effective control over the sharing of their data. Business models where users are pressured into giving consent, and where they are not properly informed about what they are consenting to, are not compliant with the law, said Bjørn Erik Thon, Director-General of the Norwegian Data Protection Authority.</p>
<h2>Invalid consents</h2>
<p>The Norwegian Data Protection Authority considers that as a general rule, consent is required for intrusive profiling and tracking practices for marketing or advertising purposes, for example those that involve tracking individuals across multiple websites, locations, devices, services or data-brokering. The same applies where a commercial app wishes to share data concerning users’ sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Users were forced to accept the privacy policy in its entirety to use the app, and they were not asked specifically if they wanted to consent to the sharing of their data with third parties. Furthermore, the information about the sharing of personal data was not properly communicated to users. We consider that this was contrary to the GDPR requirements for valid consent.</p>
<p>- Grindr is seen as a safe space, and many users wish to be discrete. Nonetheless, their data have been shared with an unknown number of third parties, and any information regarding this was hidden away, Thon added.</p>
<h2>Could result in highest Norwegian DPA fine to date</h2>
<p>An administrative fine should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.</p>
<p>- We have notified Grindr that we intend to impose a fine of high magnitude as our findings suggest grave violations of the GDPR. Grindr has 13.7 million active users, of which thousands reside in Norway. Our view is that these people have had their personal data shared unlawfully. An important objective of the GDPR is precisely to prevent <em>take-it-or-leave-it</em> “consents”. It is imperative that such practices cease, Thon emphasised.</p>
<p>We have found that Grindr has a worldwide annual turnover of at least USD $ 100&nbsp;000&nbsp;000. This means that our proposed fine will constitute approximately 10 % of the company’s turnover.</p>
<p>Our investigation has focused on the consent mechanism in place from the GDPR became applicable until April 2020, when Grindr changed how the app asks for consent. We have not to date assessed whether the subsequent changes comply with the GDPR.</p>
<h2>Not a final decision</h2>
<p>The document we have issued to Grindr is a draft decision. Grindr has been given the opportunity to comment on our findings within 15 February 2021. We will make our final decision once we have assessed any remarks the company may have.</p>
<p>Our draft decision concerns the free version of the Grindr app.</p>
<p>The Norwegian Consumer Council also filed complaints against five of the third parties receiving data from Grindr: MoPub (owned by Twitter Inc.), Xandr Inc. (formerly known as AppNexus Inc.), OpenX Software Ltd., AdColony Inc., and Smaato Inc. These cases are ongoing.</p>

<p>We made it into Iceland today! (No pictures of me in this post – I have horrible bed head at the moment, recovering from jet lag.)</p>



<p>As Americans, if we want to visit Iceland, we have a few choices:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Just drop in as a tourist for 90 days</strong> – except this is off-limits now due to the COVID19 travel bans</li><li><strong>Get a work permit and stay for years</strong> – this is what we’d originally planned to do when <a href="https://ozar.me/2020/10/were-planning-to-move-to-iceland-for-a-while/">I first shared that we were moving to Iceland for a while</a>. I had signed on to work part-time for an Icelandic company, a few days per month, in order to get a conventional work permit. However, my soon-to-be-employer had a shakeup, and rather than find another employer, we opted to…</li><li><strong>Get <a href="https://work.iceland.is/working/icelands-remote-work-long-term-visa">Iceland’s new teleworker visa</a></strong> – which lets you stay for 6 months per year as long as you’re from a country that wouldn’t normally need a tourist visa, and you can prove that you have a remote job that makes at least around $100K USD per year.</li></ul>



<p>The good news of using the teleworker visa:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_in_Iceland">Iceland’s internet infrastructure</a> is fantastic, with full 1Gbit/sec fiber available all over the country, making it easy to work remotely</li><li>I don’t have to work for someone else, and I don’t have to go into an office, so I can limit my possible exposure to COVID19</li><li>It doesn’t affect our tax status – we don’t have to pay extra income taxes in Iceland, just our normal US income taxes back home</li></ul>



<p>The bad news:</p>



<ul><li>It’s only good for 6 months per year – they’ve talked about raising that, but for now it’s still just 6 months</li><li>It’s not eligible for a permanent residency permit – if I’d have had a regular work permit and stayed for 4 years straight (less vacations), we could have gotten a permanent residency permit, so we were planning to build a house in Iceland – that’s off for now</li></ul>



<h3>The teleworker visa application process</h3>



<p>The <a href="https://www.utl.is/index.php/en/long-term-visa-for-remote-workers-and-their-family-members">teleworker visa application</a> is pretty simple, but can’t be done online: you have to send over real paper forms and passport photos. I would highly recommend shipping your application via a shipping company that includes signed proof of delivery and tracking. If you need help with the application process, <a href="https://www.workfromiceland.com/remotework">WorkFromIceland.com</a> offers an advisory package, but it costs thousands of dollars. (We didn’t use it, but I was tempted.)</p>



<p>After Iceland’s Directorate of Immigration receives your application, it goes into a bit of a black hole. We didn’t get email confirmation that our application was received, and <a href="https://www.utl.is/index.php/en/processing-time-and-applications-being-processed">Iceland’s immigration status page</a> doesn’t show what range of teleworker visas they’re working on. That page is only updated about once a month – if you apply, I’d recommend using a service like <a href="https://distill.io/">distill.io</a> to watch the page for changes.</p>



<p>We received approval via email after 5 weeks to process, but we had a few folks talking to the Iceland government on our behalf, so that might have sped things up. As we worked through the final logistics with the Directorate of Immigration, we found out that we were literally the very first people to get approvals for this new visa!</p>



<p>Iceland sends you a signed email confirmation, at which point you’re eligible to enter the country. You show this email to passport control as you enter Iceland, they check their databases, and in you go.</p>



<h3>Quarantining in Iceland</h3>



<p>Obviously this situation is very fluid, and I’m writing about the January 2021 situation. If you’re reading this later, check <a href="https://www.covid.is/english">covid.is</a> for the latest coronavirus travel restrictions.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="139" height="300" src="https://ozar.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Negative_COVID_19_test-139x300.png" alt="" srcset="https://ozar.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Negative_COVID_19_test-139x300.png 139w, https://ozar.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Negative_COVID_19_test-277x600.png 277w, https://ozar.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Negative_COVID_19_test-600x1299.png 600w, https://ozar.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Negative_COVID_19_test-768x1663.png 768w, https://ozar.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Negative_COVID_19_test.png 1125w" sizes="(max-width: 139px) 100vw, 139px"><figcaption>I passed!</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>72 hours before you fly into Iceland, you have to <a href="https://visit.covid.is/">register for your free COVID19 test</a> and download the <a href="https://www.covid.is/app/en">Rakning C-19 app</a>. Iceland tracks you by your cell phone number, and the app helps the country do contact tracing.</p>



<p>When you arrive, you get a free COVID19 test at the airport. Because they’ve got testing gear centralized in one location, you get your results back in the app quickly – ours took just about 8 hours.</p>



<p>From the airport, you have to go into quarantine for 5 days. There are a set list of hotels that accept quarantining guests, or you can go to your house. You’re allowed to pick up a rental car, and if you have a long drive ahead of you, you can stay overnight in a quarantine hotel first before setting off on your journey – but only one night. Because there are storms in the north where we need to go, we decided to just do the whole quarantine at an approved hotel instead. Room service!</p>



<p>After 5 days, you get another free COVID19 test. (The date, time, and location are sent to you via email &amp; via the Rakning-C19 app within a day of you starting quarantine.) After you receive the all-clear from your second test’s results, then you’re done with quarantining. We’ll drive up north, settle into our rental house, set up my home studio. I’m teleworking again, teaching training classes starting February 1. Oh I think I’m supposed to say 1 Feb now. I’m European. (raises pinkie finger)</p>



<p>I’m not teleworking too hard though: during our stay here, we’re working 2 weeks a month, and spending the rest of the time seeing the amazing sights of Iceland.</p>



<p>If you’ve got any questions about the application process or arriving into Iceland, let me know.</p>

<p>I have a hobby. I like citing papers that provide strong evidence that is directly in opposition to what the authors claim. Lucky me, because PNAS just published a paper that fits snuggly into this category. It’s titled <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/4/e2016976118#sec-13">“Experienced well-being rises with income, even above $75,000 per year”</a>. An even better title would have been “Income is a poor gauge for well-being; don’t bother”.</p>



<p>This is the central figure:</p>



<figure><a href="https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1024x1013.png" alt="" width="475" height="469" srcset="https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1024x1013.png 1024w, https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-300x297.png 300w, https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-768x760.png 768w, https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-202x200.png 202w, https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image.png 1034w" sizes="(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px"></a></figure>



<p>Whoa! The paper doesn’t fail to mention (multiple times) how this is virtually a perfect linear relationship between well-being and log(income). The authors conclude that people with higher income are more satisfied with life and experience more well-being!</p>



<h2>The real-life version of this graph</h2>



<p>Let’s see what this graph looks like with a linear x-axis and with simulated raw data (see code below). The black dots are simulated individual participants from the study, assuming that statistical assumptions are met. Their exact distribution along the x-axis is not known (the author did not publish raw data), but that doesn’t matter. It only matters how the dots are dispersed for a given income. </p>

<p>You are one of the black dots. You could be one of the other black dots. But income does virtually nothing to lower or improve people’s well-being or life satisfaction. Income explained 1.5% and 4% of the variance in Well-Being and Life Satisfaction respectively (see code below).</p>



<blockquote><p>Income explained 1.5% and 4% of the variance in Well-Being and Life Satisfaction respectively</p></blockquote>



<h2>Extreme income rise = extreme happiness?</h2>



<p>Let’s study the most extreme case: you have an annual income of just $15,000. But now you get to jump into the life of a rich person all the way to the other side of the (linear) graph with an annual income of $480,000. The result of this 32-fold increase in income is expected to be:</p>



<ul><li>Life Satisfaction: 62% used to rate higher than you. Now only 35% does! But there’s a 24% chance that you will be <em>less</em> happy than before.</li><li>Experienced Well-Being: 58% used to rate higher than you. Now only 40% does! But there’s a 33% chance that you will be <em>less</em> happy than before.</li></ul>



<p>Hmm, hardly the extreme happiness rush that one might expect would expect from reading the paper and the ensuing media coverage. It’s a vanishingly small effect, considering the extremeness of this example. </p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I think it’s fairer to say that we’ve now learned that this paper is solid evidence that income is a really poor gauge for happiness. Someone once wrote a song about this:</p>



<figure><img src="https://25.media.tumblr.com/bf7724c5134e8d05cef1d8431e8c1ad1/tumblr_mh1jcs8zyE1rhssuho1_500.gif" alt="money can't buy me love the beatles gif"><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://wifflegif.com/gifs/51599-money-cant-buy-me-love-the-beatles-gif">https://wifflegif.com/gifs/51599-money-cant-buy-me-love-the-beatles-gif</a></figcaption></figure>



<h2>Code</h2>



<p>Computing quantiles and probability of deterioration is simple. The z-score is your score relative to the whole population in units of standard deviations. So just the results for Life Satisfaction were obtained by reading off the extremes of the graph and computing the associated quantiles in R: <code>pnorm(-0.3)</code> and <code>pnorm(0.4)</code>. Probability of negative income change is then just <code>pnorm(-0.3, 0.4)</code>.</p>



<p>The plots are fairly straightforward too. First, let’s simulate the raw data:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="r" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group=""># Data
N = 33391  # Number of participants
incomes = exp(seq(log(15000), log(480000), length.out = N))  # x-axis of Figure 1
trend_wb = seq(-0.2, 0.25, length.out = N)  # Linear, read off Figure 1
trend_ls = seq(-0.3, 0.4, length.out = N)   # Linear, read off Figure 1
z_wb = rnorm(N, trend_wb)  # z-score is standard normal
z_ls = rnorm(N, trend_ls)  # z-score is standard normal

# Merge the data in long format
df = data.frame(
  incomes,
  z = c(rnorm(N, z_wb), rnorm(N, z_ls)),
  outcome = c(rep("Experienced Well-Being", N), rep("Life Satisfaction", N))
)
</pre>



<p>Now let’s plot it:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="r" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">ggplot(df, aes(x = incomes, y = z)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1, size = 0.3) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = c(trend_wb, trend_ls), color = outcome), lwd = 2) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 75000, lty = 2, lwd = 1, color = "#555555") + 
  facet_wrap(~outcome) + 
  #scale_x_continuous(trans = "log", breaks = c(15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 480) * 1000) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 480) * 1000, labels = scales::label_number_auto()) + 
  labs(x = "Houshold income", y = "z-scored well-being") + 
  theme_bw(13) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
</pre>



<p>If you want to verify other results, you can fit the linear models to the (simulated) data and see that we can approximately replicate the r-values reported in the paper (r = 0.17 and r = 0.09) and that this correspond to 4% and 1.5% variance explained, respectively:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="r" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">summary(lm(z_ls ~ log(incomes)))
summary(lm(z_wb ~ log(incomes)))</pre>



<p>I leave it as an exercise to the reader to filter out <code>nonlow_incomes = incomes[incomes &gt; 30000]</code> and assess the predictive performance (<code>lm(z_ls ~ log(nonlow_incomes)</code>).</p>

<h3>Anna Novakov and T. Novakov</h3>
<p><em>like a yellow silken scarf, the thick fog hangs along the quay[1]</em></p>
<p>In the 1880s, London’s frequent and well-documented episodes of fog were a phenomenon unique to England’s most densely populated, diverse, and industrialized urban center. The spectacular nature of the embankment fog, often described by eyewitnesses as changeable and even colorful, caught the imagination of many artists and writers who saw in these atmospheric manifestations a symbol of modernity and the role of industrialization on an evolving urban space. While the illusive city, shrouded in winter fog, created the perfect backdrop for mysterious, criminal activity, it also proved to be a compelling inspiration for those who read the fog as a more positive symbol of London’s cosmopolitan status. In this essay, we seek to interrelate some artistic and literary references to the fog with contemporary explanations addressing the causes of this atmospheric phenomenon. Through this interdisciplinary approach, we hope to shed light on the physical, artistic and even psychological implications of Victorian air pollution.[2]</p>
<p>Expansions of industrial activity during the later half of the 19th century resulted in frequent and severe air pollution episodes. In London, the smoke that billowed as a result of domestic and industrial coal burning began mixing with existing natural fog. Charles Dickens wrote in Bleak House that “smoke lowering down from chimney-pots, making a soft black drizzle, with flakes of soot in it as big as full-grown snowflakes –- gone into mourning, one might imagine, for the death of the sun.”[3] The resulting smog (word coined from smoke + fog), was often sited by both visitors and locals as an optical experience unique to London. These low-laying fogs reduced visibility in the city to less than a mile while resulting in the loss of up to fifty percent of the sunshine in the winter months.[4] Thomas Hardy mentions it is in his 1900 poem “The Darkling Rush” as</p>
<p>I leant upon a coppice gate,<br>
When Frost was spectre-gray,<br>
And Winter’s dregs made desolate<br>
The weakening eye of day.<br>
The tangled bine-stems scored the sky<br>
Like strings of broken lyres,<br>
And all mankind that haunted nigh<br>
Had sought their household fires.[5]</p>
<p>While writer Arthur Symons wrote that “In London, men work as if in darkness, scarcely seeing their own hands . . . and not knowing the meaning of their labour.”[6] French writer Joris-Karl Huyseman likewise wrote in 1884 that “A rainy, colossal London smelling of molten metal and of soot, ceaselessly streaming and smoking in the fog now spread out before his eyes . . . All this was transpiring in vast warehouses along the river banks which were bathed by the muddy and dull water of an imaginary Thames . . . while trains rushed past at full speed or rumbled underground uttering horrible cries and vomiting waves of smoke, and while, through every street, monstrous and gaudy and infamous advertisements flared through the eternal twilight.”[7]</p>
<p>In Jayati Gupta’s essay “London Through Alien Eyes,” published in Literary London: Interdisciplinary Studies in the Representation of London, he references Madame Krishnabhabini Das’ 1880s London experiences. She noted that “this sort of fog persists through the day and assumes different hues – sometimes ashen – sometimes black – sometimes yellow.” Another eye witness L.C.W. Bonacina gave this insightful description of yellow fog’s evolution “A really bad nineteenth century fog appeared early in the morning as a thick white mist, like the country fog, only dirtier. With the lighting of the fires it would soon become yellow and pungent, irritating the throat and eyes, till midday the continued outpouring of chimney products would have turned the fog a sooty brownish black causing the darkness of night.” Furthermore he added that, “During summer months major fogs were virtually unknown in the nineteenth century just as they are in the twentieth.”[8]</p>
<p>These, and other more contemporary reports most often described the yellow hue prevalent in London fog. Oscar Wilde noted the yellow hue in his poem “Impression du Matin”:</p>
<p>The Thames nocturne of blue and gold<br>
Changed to a Harmony in grey:<br>
A barge with ochre-coloured hay<br>
Dropt from the wharf: and chill and cold<br>
The yellow fog came creeping down<br>
The bridges, till the houses’ walls<br>
Seemed changed to shadows and St. Paul’s<br>
Loomed like a bubble o’er the town.[9]</p>
<p>Bonacina’s chromatic observations can certainly be credited to the predominance of domestic coal burning. Tars from low temperature coal combustion in the morning were yellow. The yellow tar, created in the morning, was soluble in fog water and thus colored the fog droplets creating the appearance of chromatic fog. Later in the day, emissions from industry, steam locomotives and ships increased coinciding with the darkening fogs. Tar produced in these higher temperatures took on a dark brown coloration. Atmospheric chemist Peter Brimblecombe proposed the following three possible origins for the yellow fog: (i) light scattering by smoke particles above the fog such that it was illuminated by yellowish light, (ii) the gas and weak electric light gave the fog a yellowish hue at night, and (iii) tarry compounds actually colored the fog, giving preference to the latter possibility.[10]</p>
<p>Victorian writers, noted with some frequency additional chromatic effects produced by the modern fog. In 1899, an article was published in The Artist magazine that read “There’s nothing to be seen like it ever – in any town in Europe. They say it’s due to the smoke and it may be; but just look at it. Look at the purple and crimson, the scarlet and gold . . . until with just the tiniest fleck of pink it sinks into the palest green.”[11] Aaron Watson, in an article in the Magazine of Art, suggests that the city “enfolds all ugliness in a purple haze.”[12] Charles Dickens in his novel Our Mutual Friend notes that “Even in the surrounding country it was a foggy day, but there the fog was great, whereas in London it was, at about the boundary line, dark yellow, and a little within it brown, and then browner, and then browner, until at the heart of the City — which call Saint Mary Axe – it was rustic black.”[13]</p>
<p>Visual artists, such as French painter Claude Monet, witnessed the yellow fogs as well as a variety of additional chromatic atmospheric effects. For Monet, London’s varied fogs were a spectacular manifestation of turn-of-century city life -– an optical phenomenon that he captured in a well documented and frequently referenced series of canvases.</p>
<p>London was a magical place for Monet. He beamed “I so love London! But I love it only in winter. It’s nice in summer with its parks, but nothing like it is in winter with the fog, for without the fog, London wouldn’t be a beautiful city. It’s the fog that gives it its magnificent breadth. Those massive, regular blocks become grandiose within that mysterious cloak.”[14] In 1900 he added that “The weather is magnificent but unsettled . . . I can’t begin to describe a day as wonderful as this. One [colored] marvel, after another each lasting less than five minutes, it was enough to drive one mad. No country could be more extraordinary for a painter.”[15]</p>
<p>The constantly changing chromatic effects of London’s fog were unusual and bear little resemblance to contemporary atmospheric phenomena. To understand this unique development it is vital to discuss the evidence for these chromatic fogs. Taking into account the lack of scientific, measurement-based observations, we would like to employ artistic production, such as Monet’s Thames series, as indirect evidence –- source material that forms the basis for a broader explanatory discussion of this form of air pollution.</p>
<p>Between 1898 and 1901, Monet made numerous extended trips to London. Working from an upscale Savoy Hotel suite, he created numerous paintings of the Waterloo and Charing Cross Bridges. As an accomplished and sensitive colorist, Monet found himself captivated by London’s fog and its spectacular optical appearance, which he referred to as l’enveloppe. Of particular relevance to this essay is Monet’s description “The fog in London assumes all sorts of colors; there are black, brown, yellow, green, [and] purple fogs.”[16] Was the colored fog depicted in these paintings and referenced in written accounts a subjective interpretation of the London’s cityscape or documentary evidence of London’s timely and transient atmospheric effects?</p>
<p>These hazy, colorful paintings are certainly marvelous Impressionist interpretations of the city’s skyline. The chromatic effects that Monet was trying to capture in the bridge scenes were fleeting and momentary. The changeable weather conditions of the morning fog and winter color palette, forced the artist to work on stacks of canvases at the same time. Monet recalled that “At the Savoy Hotel . . . from which I looked at my points of view, I had up to a hundred canvases under way –- of the same subject. By searching among the sketches feverishly, I chose one of them that didn’t differ too much from what I saw; despite everything, I altered it completely. When work was finished, I would notice, in moving my canvases, that I had overlooked precisely the one that would have suited me best and which I had at hand.”[17] Monet’s artistic output and his frantic attempts to capture fleeting effects are visual evidence of the changing and colorful atmospheric effects he witnessed.</p>
<p>For Monet, the Waterloo Bridge took on many manifestations depending on the time of day and visual effects of the fog. The bridge appears as mauve semi-circles in the Chicago Art Institute’s version of the Waterloo Bridge. The painting foreground focuses our eye on surface effects of undulating droplets of colored water. Receding into the background, factory chimneys reinforce the arches of the bridge while further bisecting Monet’s composition. …</p></div></article></div></div></section></div></div></div>

A <strong>Platformer</strong> investigation has found:</em></p><ul><li><p><strong>Signal appears to have more than 40 million users, up from approximately 20 million last month</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>The company is actively developing features related to user names and cryptocurrency payments, potentially creating new avenues for abuse</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>At least one employee quit Signal in recent weeks over concerns that the 6-year-old company does not have a content policy and has resisted developing one</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton has become heavily involved in daily operations, interviewing engineers and writing code</strong> </p></li><li><p><strong>CEO Moxie Marlinspike tells Platformer: “The thing about software is that you never can fully anticipate everything. We just have to be willing to iterate.”</strong></p></li></ul><p>On January 6th, WhatsApp users around the world began seeing a pop-up message notifying them of upcoming changes to the service’s privacy policy. The changes were designed to enable businesses to send and store messages to WhatsApp’s 2 billion-plus users, but they came with an ultimatum: agree by February 8th, or you can no longer use the app.</p><p>The resulting furor sparked a backlash that led Facebook-owned WhatsApp to delay the policy from taking effect until May. In the meantime, though, tens of millions of users began seeking alternatives to Facebook’s suite of products. Among the biggest beneficiaries has been Signal, the encrypted messaging app whose development is funded by a nonprofit organization. Last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/signal-brian-acton-talks-about-exploding-growth-monetization-and-whatsapp-data-sharing-outrage/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">according to one research firm</a>, the six-year-old app had about 20 million users worldwide. But in a 12-hour period the Sunday after WhatsApp’s privacy policy update began, Signal added another 2 million users, an employee familiar with the matter told me. Days of temporary outages followed.</p><p>The pace has hardly relented since. Signal leapt to No. 1 in the app stores of 70 countries, and it continues to rank near the top of most of them, including the United States. While the company won’t confirm the size of its user base, a second employee told me the app has now surpassed 40 million users globally. And while Signal still has a small fraction of the market for mobile messaging — Telegram, another upstart messenger, <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1352368555711365121">says it added 90 million active users in January alone</a> —&nbsp;the rapid growth has been a cause for excitement inside the small distributed team that makes the app.</p><p>Adding millions of users has served as a vindication for a company that has sought to build a healthier internet by adopting different incentives than most Silicon Valley companies.</p><p>“We're organized as a nonprofit because we feel like the way the internet currently works is insane,” CEO Moxie Marlinspike told me. “And a lot of that insanity, to us, is the result of bad business models that produce bad technology. And they have bad societal outcomes.” Signal’s mission, by contrast, is to promote privacy through end-to-end encryption, without any commercial motive.</p><p>But Signal’s rapid growth has also been a cause for concern. In the months leading up to and following the 2020 US presidential election, Signal employees raised questions about the development and addition of new features that they fear will lead the platform to be used in dangerous and even harmful ways. But those warnings have largely gone unheeded, they told me, as the company has pursued a goal to hit 100 million active users and generate enough donations to secure Signal’s long-term future.</p><p>Employees worry that, should Signal fail to build policies and enforcement mechanisms to identify and remove bad actors, the fallout could bring more negative attention to encryption technologies from regulators at a time when their existence is threatened around the world.</p><p>“The world needs products like Signal — but they also need Signal to be thoughtful,” said Gregg Bernstein, a former user researcher who left the organization this month over his concerns. “It’s not only that Signal doesn’t have these policies in place. But they’ve been resistant to even considering what a policy might look like.”</p><p>Interviews with current and former employees, plus leaked screenshots of internal deliberations, paint a portrait of a company that is justly proud of its role in promoting privacy while also willfully dismissing concerns over the potential misuses of its service. Their comments raise the question of whether a company conceived as a rebuke to data-hungry, ad-funded communication tools like Facebook and WhatsApp will really be so different after all.</p><p><strong>II.</strong></p><p>Like a lot of problems, this one started with an imperative familiar to most businesses: growth.</p><p>Encrypted messaging has been a boon to activists, dissidents, journalists, and marginalized groups around the world. Not even Signal itself can see their messages —&nbsp;much less law enforcement or national security agencies. The app saw a surge in usage during last year’s protests for racial justice, even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21280112/signal-face-blurring-tool-ios-android-update">adding a tool to automatically blur faces</a> in photos to help activists more safely share images of the demonstrations. This kind of growth, one that supported progressive causes, was exciting to Signal’s roughly 30-member team.</p><p>“That's the kind of use case that we really want to support,” Marlinspike told me. “People who want more control over their data and how it's used — and who want to exist outside the gaze of tech companies.”</p><p>On October 28th, <a href="https://signal.org/blog/group-links/">Signal added group links</a>, a feature that has become increasingly common to messaging apps. With a couple of taps, users could begin creating links that would allow anyone to join a chat in a group as large as 1,000 people. And because the app uses end-to-end encryption, Signal itself would have no record of the group’s title, its members, or the image the group chose as its avatar. At the same time, the links make it easy for activists to recruit large numbers of people onto Signal simultaneously, with just a few taps.</p><p>But as the US presidential election grew closer, some Signal employees began raising concerns that group links could be abused. On September 29th, during a debate, President Trump had told the far-right extremist group the Proud Boys to “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-race-and-ethnicity-donald-trump-chris-wallace-0b32339da25fbc9e8b7c7c7066a1db0f">stand back and stand by</a>.” During an all-hands meeting, an employee asked Marlinspike how the company would respond if a member of the Proud Boys or another extremist organization posted a Signal group chat link publicly in an effort to recruit members and coordinate violence.</p><p>“The response was: if and when people start abusing Signal or doing things that we think are terrible, we'll say something,” said Bernstein, who was in the meeting, conducted over video chat. “But until something is a reality, Moxie's position is he's not going to deal with it.”</p><p>Bernstein (disclosure: a former colleague of mine at Vox Media), added, “You could see a lot of jaws dropping. That’s not a strategy —&nbsp;that’s just hoping things don’t go bad.”&nbsp;</p><p>Marlinspike’s response, he told me in a conversation last week, was rooted in the idea that because Signal employees cannot see the content on their network, the app does not need a robust content policy. Like almost all apps, its terms of service state that the product cannot be used to violate the law. Beyond that, though, the company has sought to take a hands-off approach to moderation.</p><p>“We think a lot on the product side about what it is that we're building, how it's used, and the kind of behaviors that we're trying to incentivize,” Marlinspike told me. “The overriding theme there is that we don't want to be a media company. We’re not algorithmically amplifying content. We don’t have access to the content. And even within the app, there are not a lot of opportunities for amplification.”</p><p>At the same time, employees said, Signal is developing multiple tools simultaneously that could be ripe for abuse. For years, the company has faced complaints that its requirement that people use real phone numbers to create accounts <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/9kaxge/how-to-use-signal-without-giving-out-your-phone-number-a-gendered-security-issue">raises privacy and security concerns</a>. And so Signal has begun working on an alternative: letting people create unique usernames. But usernames (and display names, should the company add those, too) could enable people to impersonate others — a scenario the company has not developed a plan to address, despite completing much of the engineering work necessary for the project to launch.</p><p>Signal has also been actively exploring the addition of payments into the app. Internally, this has been presented as a way to help people in developing nations transfer funds more easily. But other messaging apps, including Facebook and China’s WeChat, have pursued payments as a growth strategy.</p><p>An effort from Facebook to develop a cryptocurrency, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/26/facebook-rebrands-libra-wallet-service-calibra-to-novi/#:~:text=Today%2C%20Facebook%20announced%20that%20Calibra%20has%20a%20new%20name%2C%20Novi.&amp;text=The%20Libra%20blockchain%20is%20supposed,%E2%80%9Cvia%E2%80%9D%20(way).">now known as Diem</a>, has been <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2019/11/05/libras-regulatory-hurdles-appear-taller-after-house-hearing/">repeatedly derailed</a> by skeptical regulators.</p><p>Marlinspike has served as an adviser to MobileCoin, a cryptocurrency built on the Stellar blockchain designed to make payments simple and secure —&nbsp;and, potentially, impossible to trace. “The idea of MobileCoin is to build a system that hides everything from everyone,” <em><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mobilecoin-cryptocurrency/">Wired</a></em><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mobilecoin-cryptocurrency/"> wrote of the project in 2017</a>. “These components make MobileCoin more resistant to surveillance, whether it's coming from a government or a criminal.”</p><p>People I spoke with told me they regard the company’s exploration of cryptocurrency as risky since it could invite more bad actors onto the platform and attract regulatory scrutiny from world leaders.&nbsp;</p><p>Marlinspike played down the potential of crypto payments in Signal, saying only that the company had done some “design explorations” around the idea. But significant engineering resources have been devoted to developing MobileCoin integrations in recent quarters, former employees said.&nbsp;</p><p>“If we did decide we wanted to put payments into Signal, we would try to think really carefully about how we did that,” Marlinspike said. “It’s hard to be totally hypothetical.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>III.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Signal’s growth imperatives are driven in part by its unusual corporate structure. The app is funded by the Signal Foundation, which was created in 2018 with a $50 million loan from WhatsApp co-founder …</p></div></div>

    <p>Over the past several weeks, GameStop stock has traded more like a cryptocurrency than a failing mall-based retailer.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/gme.png" alt="GameStop"></p>

<p>What is going on here?</p>

<p>In one sentence: Institutional investors short GameStop (i.e., the prevailing wisdom, at least until the past few weeks) are playing a game of chicken with retail investors &amp; contrarian institutions who are long. [1]</p>

<h3 id="the-current-situation">The Current Situation</h3>

<p>GameStop is a video game retailer; it has been in decline for several years now. Video games have moved to an online, direct-to-consumer distribution model. Foot traffic in malls (where most GameStops are located) was down even before COVID; many mall-based retailers are struggling.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, over the course of 2020 this led to GameStop becoming one of the <a href="https://www.highshortinterest.com/">most shorted stocks</a> on Wall Street.</p>

<p>However, there were early signs that GameStop was undervalued. Michael Burry (of <em>The Big Short</em> fame) <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gamestop-michael-burry-big-short-stock-next-gen-discs-2019-8">took a large long position in 2019</a>, claiming video game discs are not entirely dead. In August 2020, Roaring Kitty (a.k.a. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DeepFuckingValue/">u/DeepFuckingValue</a> on Reddit) published a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alntJzg0Um4">video</a> detailing why GameStop was a good play based on its fundamentals – a future short squeeze would just be the icing on the cake.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/michael_burry.jpg" alt="Michael Burry"></p>

<p>On January 11th, Ryan Cohen (founder of <a href="https://www.chewy.com/">Chewy</a>, which sold to PetSmart for $3.35 billion), <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chewy-co-founder-joins-gamestops-board-after-pushing-overhaul-11610378574">joined GameStop’s board</a> after his investment firm built up a 10% stake in the company. At this point, retail investors, especially those on the popular subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/">Wall Street Bets</a> went crazy. They highlighted that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/">GameStop was now a growth play</a>. It is now led by a previously successful founder, its online business is growing at a 300% rate, and it is in the process of turning around its core business. [2] As such, GameStop should be valued at a Venture Capital multiple of 10x+ revenue, rather than a measly 0.5x revenue.</p>

<p>This narrative is compelling. Despite short sellers warning otherwise, GameStop has continued to climb in price. All of the GameStop options issued (with a high strike price of $60) were in the money on Friday (1/22/2021), trigging a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2txra/that_was_a_margin_call/gk87z17/">gamma squeeze</a> as institutions who had written the options rushed to cover their positions. GameStop closed Friday at $65.01.</p>

<p>On Monday (1/25/2021), GameStop opened at $96.73, spiked at $159.18 (likely because of another gamma squeeze), [3] then crashed with pressure from institutional shorts, closing at $76.79 (still up 18% day-over-day).</p>

<p>But the bulls aren’t finished with GameStop. These gamma squeezes are nothing compared to what will be coming: the near-mythical “Infinity Squeeze”. Most famously seen with <a href="https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/">Volkswagen in 2008</a>, when short sellers are forced to cover their positions due to a margin call, the price of the stock rapidly rises (hypothetically to infinity) since the number of shares shorted exceeds the number of shares available to buy.</p>

<h3 id="the-allure-of-wall-street-bets">The Allure of Wall Street Bets</h3>

<p>Can a subreddit comprised of retail investors really move the market like this? I doubt it – all of the big swings in this stock have been caused by institutions. What this subreddit does is <strong>control the narrative</strong>.</p>

<p>First unveiled to the mainstream finance world in a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-26/reddit-s-profane-greedy-traders-are-shaking-up-the-stock-market">February 2020 Bloomberg article</a>, Wall Street Bets is profane (as I’m sure you’ve noticed if you clicked any of the links in this post). But Wall Street Bets isn’t some sinister, market-manipulating entity. Rather, it is a virtual water cooler for individual retail investors to post memes – and emojis, oh so many emojis – about their investments.</p>

<p>Reading Wall Street Bets feels like the discussion at a middle school cafeteria table circa 2000. Redditors on Wall Street Bets (who refer to themselves affectionately as “autists” or “retards”) [4] encourage one another to have “diamond hands” (💎 🤲), the will to stay strong and not sell a stock when things are going poorly. Contrast this with the “paper hands” (🧻 🤲) of those who are weak-willed and sell a stock based on market sentiment. Companies are headed “to the moon” (🚀). Bears are not mentioned without the adjective “gay” (🌈 🐻). Self-deprecating cuckold references to “my wife’s boyfriend” abound.</p>

<p>Despite this language (or perhaps because of it), Wall Street Bets is one of the most entertaining and informative places on the internet. People post meaningful analysis of companies that are undervalued and why they are investing. Browsing the subreddit, you get a crash course on concepts that you would otherwise learn only at a buy-side firm or working as an options trader: EBITDA multiple, book value, delta hedging, implied volatility.</p>

<p>But the most compelling aspect of Wall Street Bets is in its name: the bets. The ability to gain (or lose) a life-changing amount of money – with screenshots to prove it – creates an environment similar to that of the casino floor. And if Wall Street Bets is the casino floor, then Wall Street itself is the house.</p>

<p>The same emotion that caused us to root for the thieves in <em>Ocean’s 11</em> is what makes Wall Street Bets so enticing. Put frankly, Millennials are tired of getting fucked by the man. When you’re underemployed with $100,000 in student loan debt, your financial situation feels overwhelming. You really don’t want to take the advice of your parents or CNBC talking heads [5] to invest 10% of your salary for a 4% annual return. At that point, what’s another $5,000? Might as well buy some short-dated GME calls.</p>

<p>For those of use who don’t fit the underemployed Millennial archetype, Matt Levine’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-04-30/if-you-re-bored-you-can-trade-stocks">Boredom Markets Hypothesis</a> applies. COVID has required us to work from home, without much ability to spend for travel, dining, or entertainment. Putting money into Robinhood is a decent substitute – with the added bonus of it being an “investment”, rather than consumption. In an age where the Fed will print seemingly unlimited money to prop up capital markets, better to be irrational exuberant as a part of the market than be left out of the party.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/money_printer.jpg" alt="money printer go brrrrr"></p>

<p>Further, the narrative presented by the GameStop trade in particular is compelling. It allows the small retail investor to play a role in market events normally only played out at the hedge fund scale (a short squeeze was a key plot element in Season 1 of <em>Billions</em>). The short sellers in this case aren’t particularly sympathetic: Andrew Left of <a href="https://citronresearch.com/">Citron Research</a> released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEi2axM4hwI">video</a> in which he lays out the bear case for GameStop. His main argument was a smug appeal to authority, essentially claiming “Wall Street knows better than you people on message boards”. [6]</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/short_squeeze.jpg" alt="Billions Short Squeeze"></p>
<p>Billions, IRL (image via <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2016/02/09/billions-for-the-99-episode-4-what-it-means-to-face-a-short-squeeze/?sh=5d3100f36d69">Forbes</a>)</p>

<p>So sure, Wall Street Bets is irreverent, has irrational exuberance, and is guilty of hero worship (Elon Musk and more recently Ryan Cohen). But it also provides a sense of community during the stresses of COVID and provides a compelling way for the little guy to stick it to the man.</p>

<p>As Keynes reminded us (in the most overused finance quote of all time): <em>“The markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.”</em> When enough people believe in a vision, it can cause that vision to manifest itself. <a href="https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/gamestop-and-the-dangerous-game-of-gamma-squeezes-15546125">Wall Street is scared</a> that retail investors can manifest their own vision, rather that the one dictated by the major financial players.</p>

<h3 id="what-george-soros-got-right">What George Soros Got Right</h3>

<p>The entire GameStop scenario is a case study in reflexivity. [7] Reflexivity is the idea that our perception of circumstances influences reality, which then further impacts our perception of reality, in a self-reinforcing loop. Specifically, in a financial market, prices are a reflection of traders’ expectations. Those prices then influence traders’ expectations, and so on.</p>

<p>This may seem obvious to some, but it flies in the face of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis">efficient-market hypothesis</a>. As Soros states,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>What makes reflexivity interesting is that the prevailing bias has ways, via the market prices, to affect the so-called fundamentals that market prices are supposed to reflect. [8]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does this mean for GameStop? Because of traders’ bullish sentiment, a previously failing company is now in the position where it can leverage the overnight increase in value to make real, substantive changes to its business. GameStop can pay off debt through the issuance of new shares or make strategic acquisitions using its newly-valuable shares. [9] A struggling company could become solid simply not because of a change in the underlying business, but because investors <strong>decided it should be more valuable</strong>.</p>

<p>Reflexivity may be the best way to understand the 21st Century. <a href="https://emerging.substack.com/p/peak-reflexivity">Passive investing is an example of reflexivity in action</a>. [10] So is winner-take-all venture investing. Uber raised an absurd war chest, causing more investors to want to pile in, which led to more fundraising and eventually a successful IPO. The fact that Uber has not yet turned a profit, yet today has a $100 billion market cap, cannot be explained with traditional financial thinking, but can be explained by reflexivity.</p>

<p>The internet and instant communication only accelerates these trends. Instances of reflexivity like the strange market movements we’ve seen with GameStop are happening more and more – not only in financial markets, but also in the political and social realm, to incredible effect.</p>

<p>When Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016, I distinctly remember writing in my journal: <em>“Anything is possible.”</em> I was blown away that this complete buffoon of a man, someone who the Huffington Post <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/a-note-about-our-coverage-of-donald-trumps-campaign_n_55a8fc9ce4b0896514d0fd66">refused to cover as politics</a> meme-d his way into the presidency. He was a joke, until suddenly, in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulpa">Tulpa-esque</a> twist…he wasn’t. Similarly, internet conspiracy theories spread via Facebook memes manifested themselves in the real world when Trump supporters <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_storming_of_the_United_States_Capitol">stormed the Capitol</a> a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>Our perception shapes reality. And when enough people agree on a specific perception, it becomes reality. [11] As we become more and more connected, discourse will expand and and accelerate. We’re going to see some strange things become reality.</p>

<p>Even, perhaps, hedge funds going bankrupt and newly-minted …</p></div></div>

January 25, 2021 | https://www.weskao.com/blog/how-to-instantly-show-your-value | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.weskao.com/blog/how-to-instantly-show-your-value">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-f7b3cf53449abc80ad4f"><div><p>Happy new year from Toronto!</p><p>I’ve compiled my favorite ways to convey your product’s value prop. These apply to products and brands, but feel free to apply this to people too. These work for job interviews, selling yourself as a consultant, etc.</p><p><strong>Use before-and-after</strong>: <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/comparisons-heighten-drama" target="_blank">Everyone loves a good before-and-after contrast</a>. Before-and-afters are a powerful application of the idea of “show not tell.” That’s why you see so many before-and-afters when scrolling through your feed: weight loss (not-your-best self vs toned/healthy), home renovation (dingy bathroom vs shiny new renovation), messaging copy (bad writing vs strong writing), etc. A before-and-after is like a jump cut that skips all the boring parts--it emphasizes contrast, which heightens drama and interest. When talking about yourself, show what a project was like before you arrived and what it looked like after your contributions.</p><p><strong>Show, not tell</strong>: I recently came across AI-driven software that reduces background noise on calls. The thing that caught my eye on their homepage is the toggle “on” and “off” button where you can hear a sound sample without their tool versus how much sharper the sound is with their tool. It was pretty incredible and instantly sold me. As a marketer, I’m always on the lookout for <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/case-study-dissecting-an-everyday-story" target="_blank">when I change my mind</a>. It’s hard to change people’s minds, so when it happens successfully, try to learn what worked. Think of how you can demonstrate the value of your product like this.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610079443099_26862"><div><p><strong>Experiential, temporal, sensory</strong>: It’s hard for most brands to describe your product’s value quickly. It’s especially hard if your product has an experiential, temporal, or sensory component.&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><em>Experiential</em>: How do you convey a sense of community and belonging? The altMBA had this challenge. In-person courses had websites that showed photos of participants drawing on post-its and pointing at white boards. But our course was entirely online. Photos of people sitting at a computer would hardly do justice. We ended up using screenshots of Zoom gallery view among other things. Not perfect, but we chose to rely less on photography and more on other design elements given this constraint.</p></li><li><p><em>Temporal</em>: How do you convey the value of your product if it lasts 10x longer than competitors who are selling for cheaper? How do you convey the value or benefit of your product if there’s no immediate benefit in a world that loves instant gratification? Think of examples of products you’ve purchased where there’s less immediate value but more long-term value, and how the value prop was positioned.</p></li><li><p><em>Sensory</em>: How do you convey smell through a computer screen? How do you convey how good your weighted blanket feels? To solve this, consumer products will focus more on the emotion, less on the product features. For body wash, the brand doesn’t talk about how the sulfates will get you clean, how it smells, and the ounces of product you get. They talk about taking a moment for yourself.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Don’t worry about correct grammar</strong>. Go ahead and break grammar rules. The only thing that matters is that your customer takes action and you build trust in the process. I add that last part about building trust because you want to aim for conversion, but not destroy your brand equity in the process. It’s a delicate balance per the <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/brand-marketing-vs-performance-marketing" target="_blank">Brand vs Performance Marketing Spectrum</a>.</p><p><strong>Increase desire, don’t just decrease friction</strong>: People jump through hoops for things they want. Did you pick your spouse because they were the most convenient option? No, you picked them despite needing to overcome obstacles. We tend to focus on removing friction because it feels comfortable and there’s a checklist of ways to do it. There’s less of a formula for <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/increasing-desire-vs-decreasing-friction" target="_blank">increasing desire</a>--which makes it all the more worthwhile because there’s upside potential that fewer people attempt to tap into.</p><p><strong>Be/Have/Do</strong>: This is one of my favorite frameworks for showing transformation. You want to show how your product helps a brand transform. What does your product let your customer be that they weren’t before? What do customers have that they didn’t have before? What can they do now that they couldn’t do before? This is a good exercise to focus your value proposition and generate talking points for business development, sales, and marketing copy.</p><p><strong>Aim for “No brainer status”</strong>: You need to aim for an instant yes. Not a yes after a hundred hours of nurturing. Think about what features, benefits, and value would make this an instant yes for your prospective customers. By the way, even if you think it’s an instant yes, you’ll still need to work at getting the yes. <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/everything-takes-longer-than-you-think-so-plan-accordingly" target="_blank">Everything takes longer than you think</a>. The reason to aim for a no brainer status is because this is like a rubber band. We’re stretching it, but it will snap back a bit.</p><p><strong>Do what makes their eyes light up (ELU)</strong>: You should have your pitch ready, but <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/eyes-light-up-elu" target="_blank">watch out for what makes people’s eyes light up</a>. What makes them lean in? You can tell when someone doesn’t really care about what you’re saying. Then there are moments when suddenly a spark of aliveness flashes in their eyes because you just said something they care about. Watch for ELU.</p><p><strong>Avoid backstory scope creep</strong>: This applies to showing your value via email, pitches, or conversations. Remove the 90% of stuff that’s only moderately relevant, and be ruthlessly focused on the 10% that’s most relevant to your audience. Talking about your camping trip? <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/start-right-before-you-get-eaten-by-the-bear" target="_blank">Start right before you almost get eaten by a bear</a>. Not a detailed agenda of the days leading up to arriving at camp.</p><p><strong>Consider overhauling and starting from scratch</strong>: If you’re struggling to describe your value, figure out <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/how-to-fix-limbo-copywriting" target="_blank">if the problem is the marketing or the underlying idea</a>.</p><p><strong>Focus on what your customer wants to hear about, not what you want to talk about</strong>: This is an easy way to figure out what to trim from your talking points. You think, “I have so much to talk about. Where do I start??” Start by asking yourself what would change your audience’s behavior for the better. I call this principle <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/strategy-not-self-expression" target="_blank">Strategy, Not Self-Expression</a>.</p><p><strong>Choose the right heuristics and design to appeal to people like us</strong>: Upon landing on a site, most customers are judging you within a few seconds. “People like us” refers to whatever group you might identify with. For example, people like us could be thoughtful, design-conscious knowledge workers at tech startups.</p><p>What’s a product that instantly sold you? I’m curious and would love to know…</p></div></div></div>]]>

                    <p>One solution is to buy a decommissioned cargo ship, and then strand it on a very shallow part of the sea, on international waters. You need really deep pockets and an adventurous spirit to succeed with this, but what an exciting adventure it would be!</p>
                    
                    <h2>Finding a ship</h2>
                    <p>The ship has to be large enough to become a small island where you can live permanently, and sustain yourself through growing of food. It also has to be large enough to not get turned over in a storm. This leaves us with large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_tanker" target="_blank">oil tankers</a>. They are flat bottomed, and have several <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_the_oil_tanker" target="_blank">compartments</a> for the cargo which will make them more stable in rough seas.</p>
                    <p>To know the price of decommissioned ships we can look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_breaking" target="_blank">ship breaking yards</a>. In <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@22.4365831,91.7317171,15z" target="_blank">Chittagong, Bangladesh</a>, there is one of the biggest ship grave yards in the world, where they run the ships full speed onto the shore, and the locals are busy cutting them up into pieces and selling it as scrap metal.</p>
                    <p><i>Below: The coastline of Chittagong is lined with ships.</i></p>
                    <p><img src="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/ChittagongShipGraveyard.jpg"></p>
                    <p><i>Below: Zooming in you can see how the ships are being cut to pieces.</i></p>
                    <p><img src="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/ChittagongShipGraveyard2.jpg"></p>
                    <p>The scrap metal companies buy a medium size ship for around <a href="http://www.jimbojack.com/Countries/Bangladesh/Bangladesh_Chittagong_Ship-breaking_Yards.htm" target="_blank">$10 million</a>. Add to that the cost of sailing the ship to its final destination.</p>
                    <p>What remains is to contact shipping companies, and add yourself to the wait list of one of their vessels.</p>
                    <h2>Destination</h2>
                    <p>The challenge is to find a part of the ocean that is very shallow, but on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_on_the_Law_of_the_Sea" target="_blank">international waters</a>, which is 22 km (12 nautical miles) from the shoreline. To be safe, it should also be out of each country's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_economic_zone" target="_blank">exclusive economic zone</a>, which is 370 km from the shoreline.</p>
                    <p><i>Below: Waters (light blue) outside of any country's exclusive economic zone (dark blue).</i></p>
                    <p><img src="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/ExclusiveEconomicZones.jpg"></p>
                    <p>If possible it should be in a climate that makes farming easy, in a part of the world not afflicted by piracy, and in relatively calm waters.</p>
                    <p>How shallow does the ocean have to be? The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(hull)" target="_blank">draft</a> of a reasonably large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panamax" target="_blank">Panamax</a> class tanker is 10 to 15 m.</p>
                    <p>To find the shallow parts of the oceans, we can use <a href="https://www.google.com/earth/" target="_blank">Google Earth</a>&nbsp;to visualize data about seamounts (mountains in the oceans) from <a href="http://www.seaaroundus.org/" target="_blank">SeaAroundUs.org</a>, and then match this with the EEZ areas, as a user has done at the <a href="http://www.seasteading.org/forum-list/topic/natural-breakwaters-avoiding-waves-geography/" target="_blank">Seasteading.org</a> web site.</p>
                    <p>I have saved the data files here for future reference: <a href="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/ExclusiveEconomicZones.kmz">ExclusiveEconomicZones.kmz</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/SeamountsUnder100m.kmz">SeamountsUnder100m.kmz</a>.</p>

                    <p>The Vitoria-Trinidade site looks like the easiest and safest option, and also the least afflicted by storms.</p>
                    <p>The ship could possibly be sailed slowly into position, and then sunken to rest on the ocean floor, by initially filling the tanks with water, and then replacing it with rocks sourced from the bottom.</p>
                    <p>But this requires the ocean floor to be reasonably flat, which might prove difficult, so a more realistic approach would be to anchor the ship using several huge anchors and long chains, and then filling up the bottom of the ship with ballast to make the ship behave well in storms.</p>
                    <p>On top of the deck you fill up with soil and plant trees and have various types food production. A Panamax ship has a deck of around 280 x 30 m, which is 8,400 m2, or the size of a soccer field.</p>
                    <p>Fresh water is made by desalination of sea water. Solar panels provide electricity. For housing the existing bunks of the ship is used.</p>
                    <p>Some obvious considerations include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Protection from intruders.</li>
                        <li>Having sustainable food production.</li>
                        <li>Protection from storms and high waves.</li>
                        <li>Hull maintenance, to save it from deteriorating in the saline water.</li>
                        <li>Carefully examining the site to look for geological problems (under water volcanoes, active fractures, etc).</li>
                    </ul>

<p>The War on Drugs is a massive failure. As neuroscientist and Columbia University Professor Dr. Carl Hart writes in his latest book, <em>Drug Use for Grown-Ups: Chasing Liberty in the Land of Fear</em>, “the American taxpayer spends approximately $35 billion each year fighting this war, yet the drugs in question remain as plentiful, if not more so, than they were in 1981, when the sum total of America’s annual drug-control budget was a mere $1.5 billion.” The difference now, Hart describes, is that today, tens of thousands of people are dying from drug-related overdoses—with opioids being the “primary culprit.” But it’s not that simple, when the “opioid crisis” in particular is, in reality, “a crisis of data collection and reporting.” In this account, Hart digs below the surface to re-evaluate the American relationship to drugs, while shedding light on his own personal relationship to drugs, as well. Both captivating and controversial, we caught up with Dr. Hart to talk about drugs and parenting, policy, addiction, and more.&nbsp;</p>

What’s one thing you really want readers to glean from it?&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p>CH: The thesis of the book is very simple: It’s about liberty so long as you don’t disrupt other people’s ability to pursue their liberty. I want people to understand that liberty and the pursuit of happiness are protected in our founding document. It’s the core of being American.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="h-in-the-book-you-re-very-open-about-your-own-drug-use-what-s-that-like-coming-out-of-the-drug-closet-as-a-professional-and-as-a-parent"><span id="In_the_book_youre_very_open_about_your_own_drug_use_Whats_that_like_coming_out_of_the_drug_closet_as_a_professional_and_as_a_parent"><strong>In the book, you’re very open about your own drug use. What’s that like, coming out of the drug closet, as a professional and as a parent?</strong></span></h2>
<p>That’s a big question I have to face and I still struggle with it. The most important point for me is that I live like the man that I claim to be, and that means that I have to think about how my children see me. They know that I take care of my responsibilities with them and that I care about our broader community. They see people suffering, being vilified, and persecuted for being labeled a drug user—and they know their father is standing up on behalf of those people, who have been cast away in society, and they feel good about it. As long as they feel good, I feel good. My primary concern is my family, and my children in particular.&nbsp;</p>

I think before he thought I would remember, my dad would sometimes smoke “herb” in front of me before I was old enough to register the observation.

<p>My drug use is still personal and private. It’s like asking, “have your children seen you have sex?” I’m 54 years old, I’m not a child, and so I engage in grown-up behaviors in which my children will not observe me. I don’t observe them doing certain things, either. I only care about them being safe and taking care of themselves.</p>

At the same time, it’s a good opportunity to model a responsible, healthy relationship to drugs (be it heroin, cannabis, or even alcohol). How do you reconcile this with the query from those who might bring up the argument that trying drugs, like heroin, will automatically lead to addiction?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p>There’s a lot in that question, so let’s unpack the first major point: How do you model responsible drug behavior? First of all, I don’t think of drug-taking behavior as abhorrent or unique. It’s just behavior. How do you model behavior? Well, what do responsible people do?&nbsp;</p>
<p>They keep their appointments, they make their obligations. And with drugs, you set aside time for that activity, and you know how long it takes for you to engage in that activity, and once it’s over, you carry out the other responsibilities you have. It’s not different from any other behavior—this is the big lie that’s so hard to undo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And this notion that one hit and you’ll become addicted is nonsense: That point is always overstated. If a person is already irresponsible, then if they take heroin, they might also be irresponsible with their heroin use. How responsible a person is will tell how well they handle those other behaviors; it predicts how well they will do heroin or pay their bills. So their drug behavior, whether heroin or cannabis, is not unique from other behaviors.</p>

<p><strong><em>Read: <a href="https://doubleblindmag.com/end-the-war-on-drugs-psychedelics-drug-decriminalization/">Where Will Psychedelics and Other Drugs Be Decriminalized Next?</a></em></strong></p>

<h2 id="h-so-when-we-talk-about-drug-legalization-and-people-ask-what-about-the-addicts-what-do-you-say"><span id="So_when_we_talk_about_drug_legalization_and_people_ask-what_about_the_addicts-what_do_you_say">So when we talk about drug legalization and people ask—”what about the addicts?”—what do you say?</span></h2>

<p>In the U.S. and around the world, when we think about addiction, people tend to blame the drug—the substance, itself—for causing addiction, and that’s a limited and inaccurate approach. The majority of people who use any drug are not addicted: That tells you that you have to look beyond the drug with people who meet criteria for addiction. You’ll find that people who already have psychiatric disorders, or limited economic opportunities, are more likely to have the criteria for drug addiction. It’s not the drug that you have to focus on, but those other factors, regardless of whether they’re using the drug or not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part of the problem with the drug discussion is that addition has hijacked the conversation, such that we only talk about drug addiction when talking about drug use. It’s like only talking about car crashes when we talk about automobiles. It’s ridiculous. So we have to change that, and that’s what I’m trying to do. If when we talk about drug use and we gave addiction proportional treatment of the topic, it wouldn’t be talked about that often. It’s a concern, but the reason people are addicted is not because of the drug.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>When we think about addiction, people tend to blame the drug—the substance, itself—for causing addiction, and that’s a limited and inaccurate approach. The majority of people who use any drug are not addicted: That tells you that you have to look beyond the drug.</p></blockquote>

<h2 id="h-so-if-the-majority-of-drug-users-are-not-problematic-drug-abusers-how-did-drug-use-and-abuse-get-conflated"><span id="So_if_the_majority_of_drug_users_are_not_problematic_drug_abusers_how_did_drug_use_and_abuse_get_conflated">So if the majority of drug users are not problematic drug “abusers,” how did drug use and abuse get conflated?</span></h2>
<p>When we think about the addiction narrative, the reason many of these substances are prohibited is American racism. One of the primary motivating factors behind alcohol prohibition was dislike of the Germans; remember this was around the time of World War I. When we think about cocaine, to vilify it, its negative effects were associated with Black people. When we wanted to vilify opioids, we paired it with the Chinese. All of this media hysteria was inaccurate—lies and misinformation. By connecting horrible acts with those groups and the drugs they used, the media reports and politicians gained standing. They oftentimes used white women as the object of their protections, so they were protecting white women and children from being corrupted with these drugs. Once they were corrupted, they would intermingle with those other racial groups—so they really tied the potential for addiction with these drugs, hoping to make people fearful of taking them in their quest to protect primarily white women. That’s how we have this connection.</p>

And how do we define drug abuse, versus drug use, to begin with?</span></h2>
<p>We define it as when people have certain symptoms in which they have disruptions in their functioning: They may not be meeting their occupational obligations, their family obligations, or other obligations. They may be actively trying to quit and having a hard time. They may experience some negative effects from their drug use, whether physiological or social, and they are disturbed by all these symptoms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They, themselves, must be disturbed by these symptoms. Such as, you may engage in behavior and your significant other may not like it, but you may not be troubled by the behavior or it may not actually be a problem. So the person, themself, must be distressed by these symptoms, too. The person’s own perspective is important.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our country, each of us are guaranteed life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We often think about those rights as guarantees in jingoistic terms, as opposed to unpacking how serious and noble those ideas are, and so I’m trying to remind people that everyone has those unalienable rights. That means they can’t be taken away from them, as long as they don’t disrupt other people’s ability to pursue their rights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I had a relative who had a drug problem, I’d be hard pressed to find a place in the U.S. where I would send them—in large part because, too often, those places focus their energies on the drug itself, as opposed to those other psychosocial factors, such as whether that person has housing, health care, or gainful employment (that is, employment that would be appropriate for their age, education, ability to support a family, all those things). Does the person have other psychiatric illnesses or problems going on? All those factors are far more important than the drug itself. And too often the drug rehab centers focus on the drug itself and miss the boat.</p>

<p>For one, why are we missing the boat when we talk about opioids? We are getting it wrong because there is money in getting it wrong. There are grants now to deal with the so-called opioid crisis. This is an economic strategy, as opposed to making sure people have gainful employment. Police organizations get grants. NGOs get grants to deal with opioids. Coroners, medical examiners, everyone is getting money to deal with it. Everything they do, they see opioids because that’s where the spotlight is shining—if you’re looking for something, you’ll find it.</p>
