<p>Suppose you double-click on a file on your computer. You're doing this so you can open the file and work with it. But does your operating system know what that means? How does it know <em>what</em> to open the file <em>in</em>? Let's look at some solutions that have been proposed over the years to solving this issue.</p>
<p>(fun fact: this originally started as a touchup of <a href="https://invisibleup.com/articles/2/">one of my oldest articles</a> before just kinda becoming this whole <em>thing</em>, so expect a bit of retreading.)</p>
<h2>Nothing</h2>
<p><img alt="IBM 709 in use" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/34/IBM709.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>Used in</strong>: Early mainframes such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_704">IBM 704</a>, etc.</p>
<p>(Image credit: <a href="https://www.computer-history.info/Page4.dir/pages/IBM.704.dir/">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a>)</p>
<p>What's a "file", anyways? It's a sequence of bytes on a disk, possibly floppy. Or a tape. (Cassette or paper, your choice.) Or on stacks of cards with holes in them. Or toggled in by hand on a front panel.</p>
<p>File types weren't relevant because <em>files</em> weren't really a thing. In the mainframe era, you typically 
1. loaded a program on to your computer from punch cards or a tape
2. fed input into that program either from a teletype terminal or from a different tape/card deck
3. received output from the teletype, a line printer, or yet another tape/card deck</p>
<p>Computers weren't complicated enough where there was any confusion as to what a file on a certain medium <em>was</em>, simply because there was so little to work with. If you had a stack of punchcards, that was your "file". Hope you labeled the box you put it in!</p>
<p>Tapes are more interesting, because they hold substantially more data. (A whopping 5.76 megabytes, stored on 3/4 of a kilometer of magentic tape. How exciting!) That said, storing more than one file on a tape was a strange task. Operating systems weren't really a <em>thing</em> yet. The best that existed were programming languages such as FORTRAN or COBOL that had statements for hardware tasks such as reading from or writing to a tape or punch card. For example, <a href="http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Fortran/102649787.05.01.acc.pdf">here's the manual for FORTRAN for the IBM 704.</a> We have several commands such as <code>READ</code> (from the punch card reader), <code>READ TAPE</code>, <code>PUNCH</code> (new cards), <code>PRINT</code> (to the printer), etc.</p>
<p>On the IBM tape units of the time (ex: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_727">IBM 727</a>), tapes were separated into <em>files</em> and <em>records</em>. In FORTRAN, records were created on every <code>WRITE TAPE</code> command, and could be read with <code>READ TAPE</code> later. Records could be overwritten by using the <code>BACKSPACE</code> statement and then writing again. Files were collections of records, and could be created with an <code>END FILE</code> command.</p>
<p>As an aside, later programming languages such as C still share their heritage from this era. This is why we draw text to the screen with <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/"><code>printf</code></a> which long ago would have literally printed to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletype_Model_33">teletype terminal</a>, why we read files using <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/rewind/"><code>rewind</code></a>, <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/fseek/"><code>fseek</code></a>, <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/fread/"><code>fread</code></a>, and <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/fwrite/"><code>fwrite</code></a> as if we were on a tape drive still. Even <a href="http://www.asciitable.com/">ASCII</a>, the encoding most commonly used for the basic Latin alphabet, has code points for file, group, record, and unit separators. (This may also be related to block terminals, something that will be discussed in a future article.)</p>
<p>As mainframes moved onto more advanced batch processing and later interactive time-share operating systems like UNIX, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/360_and_successors">OS/360</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Terminal_System">Michigan Terminal System</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incompatible_Timesharing_System">ITS</a>, etc., they gained more sophisticated methods of dealing with files than raw tape drive access. But then came the microcomputers.</p>
<h2>Type Codes</h2>
<p><img alt="Apple DOS file listing" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/34/appledos.gif"></p>
<p><strong>Used in</strong>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_DOS">Apple DOS for Apple II</a> (1978-1980), <a href="https://www.hpmuseum.org/hp28c.htm">HP-28</a> and <a href="https://www.hpmuseum.org/hp48s.htm">HP-48</a> series, etc.</p>
<p>We have floppy disks now. They can store a lot of files, rename them, delete them, etc. without too much issue. There's this neat computer called the Apple II that just came out. It uses these new-fangled disks, so it needs to figure out how to store files on it.</p>
<p>The way that Apple DOS (the Apple II's disk operating system for most of it's life) stored files is somewhat interesting. Each file has a name (up to 30 characters) and also a <em>type code</em>. 8 of them were defined but only 4 of them mattered:</p>
<ul>
<li>I (Integer BASIC program)</li>
<li>A (Applesoft BASIC program)</li>
<li>B (Binary files; either assembled programs or data)</li>
<li>T (ASCII text files)</li>
</ul>
<p>Apple DOS had some specific commands that interacted with these types. For instance, the <code>RUN</code> command worked on both Interger BASIC and Applesoft BASIC programs, and chose which one to use. <code>BRUN</code>, <em>binary run</em>, only worked on binary files. <code>OPEN</code>, <code>READ</code>, <code>WRITE</code>, and <code>CLOSE</code> all worked only on ASCII text files.</p>
<p><strong>The types more served as a way to help the operating system more so than you.</strong> This is especially evident in the late 80's and early 90's HP calculators such as the HP-28c and the HP-48GX. These calculators didn't have disks, but they did have persistent memory that could store objects into folders much like a computer.</p>
<p>These calculators used Reverse Polish Notation. Essentially, you do math by placing objects on the stack and then executing commands, which take things from the stack and put a new thing on. An <em>object</em> in RPN is something you placed on the stack. The HP-48's Advanced User's Reference Manual lists 32 distinct types, including real numbers, complex numbers, character strings, arrays, lists, variable names, executable programs, graphics objects, directories, etc. A <em>command</em> could be, say, <code>ADD</code> or some fancy plotting calculus stuff. Whatever they were, they needed to know what types they were dealing with so that they could either reject the input or properly work with it.</p>
<p>Like the Apple II, just having an integer for a type is perfectly okay because the types don't serve the user. They're just there so the operating system knows what a given chunk of bytes on the stack <em>is</em>. There are a few reserved spots for custom types, but for the most parts new types aren't expected to ever be added, nor should they be.</p>
<h3>File Extensions</h3>
<p><img alt="CP/M disk listing as seen on an Amstrad CPC" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/34/cpm.gif"></p>
<p><strong>Used in</strong>: AMSDOS (Amstrad CPC), CP/M, MS-DOS, etc.</p>
<p>Microcomputers really started to gain in popularity with the likes of the ZX Spectrum, the Amstrad CPC and the Commodore 64 among others. These were fairly cheap and simple computers. When first launched, these came with nothing but cassette tape inputs, as disks were too expensive.</p>
<p>On these computers, you'd attach a cassette player using a standard AUX cord (although some, like the CPC, had a cassette player built in), and the computer would instruct you when to start and stop the tape. These cassette players usually came with a little counter that rolled up as the tape progressed, to help you tell where the tape was. When you insert a tape, you reset the counter to zero. When you want to <em>make</em> a file, you'd write down what the counter read, then save the file. To <em>load a specific file</em>, you'd seek the tape until you're at the location you've written down, then start reading.</p>
<p>More advanced computers such as the Amstrad CPC instead saved <a href="http://www.cpcwiki.eu/index.php/AMSDOS_Header">a header</a> with each file containing, among other things, a file name and extension. If asked for a specific file it could just read the tape until it found it. Later these computers gained disk drives, and any ad-hoc tape fiddling was replaced with a proper file system such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table">FAT</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_File_System">MFS</a> that stored <em>where</em> a file was on a given disk and <em>what is was called</em>.</p>
<p>File codes are limited. It is nigh-on impossible to add more ones. What you have is what you got. So... what if we just made the codes out of letters? A couple of them? And they could be anything. Then programmers could come up with whatever file extensions they want and that's okay.</p>
<p>Suppose, in MS-DOS, you have a file named <code>REPORT.TXT</code>. <code>REPORT</code> is the file name, <code>TXT</code> is the extension. <strong>File extensions give an easy, consistent indicator of what a file contains.</strong> A <code>TXT</code> file contains text, a <code>BMP</code> file is a bitmap, etc. </p>
<p>Some file extensions, like <code>EXE</code>, <code>BAT</code>, <code>SYS</code> and <code>COM</code> had special meaning much in the same way that the Apple DOS codes had special meanings, but other than that they're just there to help the user. <strong>The user had to manually choose which program to use.</strong> This allowed for the user to choose what view or editor to use depending on what would be the most helpful. Unfortunately, there were no default programs. If the user didn't know which program, say, a <code>VIZ</code> file is for, they're out of luck. Is it a visualization? Some manga thing? The digital manifestation of a cute internet ghost who's staying up way too late geeking out about old computers? <em>The world may never know...</em></p>
<h3>Creator Codes</h3>
<p><strong>Used in:</strong> Classic Mac OS</p>
<p><img alt="File properties dialog on Classic Mac OS" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/34/macinfo.gif"></p>
<p>Let's hop on over to the Macintosh for a quick second. It was a newfangled thing in 1984, and it had the opportunity to reinvent the wheel and break compatibility with CP/M and mainframe traditions. And so it did.</p>
<p>The original 128K Macintosh used 400K floppy disks, a not-completely-terrible amount of space for the time. It used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_File_System">MFS</a>, which didn't support directories but <em>did</em> support files. It was also completely graphically driven. The Finder was supposed to be the primary way of interacting with files, and the <code>File &gt; Open</code> command could launch the program that made the file. How'd it do that?</p>
<p><strong>Instead of file extensions, the Macintosh used type and creator codes</strong>. These were 4-byte identifiers, much like file extensions, but there were two of them each with a different meaning. The type code was mean to represent the format the data was stored in, used to filter files in the Finder's "Open" dialog. The creator code was meant to indicate the application that created the file, and used by the Finder to choose which specific application to launch. Now, these weren't normally visible to the user. They just saw the file name and a icon for that type.</p>
<p>To do that, the system kept a database of codes and their associated icons and programs. When ran for the first time or moved from disk to disk, <strong>the Finder would read the program data and register in a database what creator codes and file types it supported.</strong> The Finder would then save this information on the disk containing the application. Later, <strong>when the user opened a file, the OS would check its type and creator code against its stored list to determine which application to use.</strong> This worked pretty well.</p>

      <p>All is quiet at Greta Thunberg's home on Kungsholmen in Stockholm. On this day one year ago she was at sea, on a catamaran in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Now she has just come home from school. Labrador Roxy is asleep on the couch, and Moses, the golden retriever, has crashed out on the floor. A thousand-piece jigsaw puzzle is spread out over the kitchen table on which Greta lays edge pieces while waiting for Sir David to appear on the computer monitor.</p>
        
    
  
    

        
    
  
    

      <p><strong>This fall, she is the main character</strong> in Nathan Grossman's feature film Greta. He has recently released the film and the book A Life on our Planet.</p>
      <p>In the introduction to the film, Sir David says:</p>
      <p>”The natural world is disappearing. The evidence is all around us, it is happened in my lifetime. I have seen it with my own eyes.”</p>
      <p>The story starts in 1937, the year he turned 11.</p>
      <p>Then: Wilderness on 66 percent of the Earth, a carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere of 280 ppm.</p>
      <p>And now? Wilderness on 35 percent of the Earth, a carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere of 415 ppm.</p>
      <p>Just like climate change and the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/11/covid-19-pandemics-nature-scientists/">ongoing pandemic</a>, the loss of biodiversity is part of a major sustainability crisis caused by humans.</p>

      <p><strong>The computer pings</strong>, and Gretas kitchen is filled with a familiar voice coming from the speakers. A voice usually accompanied by pictures of vast savannas, colorful coral reefs and mighty animals cheerfully says:</p>
      <p>”Hello, Greta!”</p>
        
    
  
    

        
    
  
    

      <p>DN's Head of Culture Björn Wiman leads the conversation by link from home.</p>
      <p><strong>Björn Wiman: ”Sir David, how is life for you during the pandemic?”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>David Attenborough:</strong> ”Well, it is not so bad. I am lucky to have a garden. It is not a big garden, but it is a garden, and it has a pond. I get food delivered once a week. And I have a lot to do: I can write here and I record, doing my voiceovers while watching the programs on a screen. So I have been pretty active... I have not actually left the house in eight and a half months, which is extraordinary. But I cannot complain.”</p>
      <p><strong>”Greta, I know that films and documentaries like the ones Sir David has made were what got you interested in this subject from the start.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Greta Thunberg:</strong> ”Yes, that is right. It was by watching documentaries and films that I was introduced to the climate crisis and the environmental crisis. That is how I learned and linked the facts to start with. It was a big eye-opener for me.”</p>

      <p><strong>”This conversation is about two parts of the same major crisis: Climate change and the mass extinction of other species on Earth. My impression is that the climate crisis sometimes takes up a disproportionate amount of space and that too little attention is focused on the interaction between these two crises. Do you agree?”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>GT:</strong> ”These crises are interconnected. We cannot communicate one crisis without communicating the other. Unfortunately, the media today works in such a way that we want simple and click-friendly headlines. That can make it difficult to explain complex issues, and this is a very complicated issue. We need to connect the information: This is not one crisis, it is not two or three separate crises. This is a symptom of a much bigger issue.”</p>

      <p><strong>GT:</strong> ”No, I do not think there is too much focus on nature. I think there is too little focus on nature.”</p>

      <p><strong>”Does that also apply to the ”solution side” of this problem? You sometimes hear ‘the solution can be found in new technological systems’ or ‘the solution is that we change our way of life’.”</strong></p>

Fishing has a set of problems, carbon dioxide emissions have different problems, the way we treat agricultural land. The fuel and energy industries have their own challenges. So there is not just one miraculous action that allows us to say, ‘Right, bingo, there we have it! We have resolved the issue.’ It is not like that! There are millions of issues.”</p>
      <p><strong>GT:</strong> ”Exactly. Sometimes it feels like we are wasting the little time we have now by arguing about what solution is best. ‘We shouldn not be doing this because this is better.’ As if we had a choice! As if we can decide for ourselves what we need to do, and as if there is one magical solution that will fix everything. We need to get away from that narrative, we need to leave that idea behind us.”</p>
      <p><strong>DA:</strong> ”Yes, I agree. And at the end of the day, you know, it is a big world. The only thing we can do – what you, Greta, are particularly good at – is to ensure that people around the world see what the problem is. We have to be persistent, and we have to make sure there is a large democratic multitude of voices saying 'do something, do something, do something'. We have to keep that choir alive, or those with power will not react. But even when they do react, it is extremely difficult to reach agreement on how we should treat the oceans or the atmosphere.”</p>
      <p><strong>GT:</strong> ”Yes. For a crisis as complex as this one, which we do not fully understand – for there will always be things we are unaware of – we must bring together all the experts. We have to deal with the crisis as a crisis and work together from there. We cannot expect to have all the answers delivered to us, for someone to say, ‘This is what we need to do. This is going to solve the problem.’ We have to find the answers along the way.”</p>

      <p><strong>DA:</strong> ”Yes. And we cannot expect it to happen overnight, or in a year, or even in a decade. That we are going to solve all the problems. But there have been major changes already... I remember that ten years ago it was considered strange to invest in wind power and solar panels. But it actually happened! And veganism – you are a vegan, Greta – I mean: It has happened! So changes are happening, they are not sufficient, and they are not dramatic enough, but... We all move in our own circles, so it is hard to generalize. But in my circles I meet far more people who understand the problems now, far more people who do what they can in their own lives.”</p>

<p><strong>Monopoly Technology Platforms are Colonizing Education</strong></p>
<p><strong>By Larry Kuehn</strong></p>
<p>The exposés of abuse by social media corporations like Google and Facebook have finally brought attention to the dangers of monopolies over our communications. The way these monopolies have been colonizing public education has, however, gone almost unnoticed. This is rampant privatization sneaking in as essential to “21<sup>st</sup> Century learning.”</p>
<p>The top five global capital corporations are technology platforms—Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook. Platforms are a host for a variety of services and uses. All of the big five platform corporations have become too large in a short period of time to have any significant competition outside of this group. They compete against one another, adding services to secure their monopoly by offering users everything they do online.</p>
<p>If a new service is developed that seems to be gaining users, or that competes with an element of their platform, it is purchased and integrated into the platform—avoiding new competitors. Alternatively, they use their massive resources to develop a comparable app and push the potential competitor aside.</p>
<p>Snicek, in <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Platform+Capitalism-p-9781509504862"><em>Platform Capitalism</em></a>, points out that the development of these monopolies “introduces new tendencies within capitalism that pose significant challenges to a post-capitalist future.” Building public cooperative platforms becomes an impossible dream.</p>
<p>No surprise—these platforms have moved to colonize education. Public education represents a big chunk of potential revenue. Just as importantly, schools are where one can find most of the future potential consumers and users of the platform services.</p>
<p>Colonization is a process where a significant force moves into an area and dominates. It takes over not only the production and resources, but imposes—often by stealth and power—the processes and approaches and even values of the social and cultural environment. And, dominate is what the monopoly platforms are on track to do in public education.</p>
<p><img src="http://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/G-Suite-For-Education-400x200.png" alt="" width="262" height="131" srcset="https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/G-Suite-For-Education-400x200.png 400w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/G-Suite-For-Education-768x384.png 768w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/G-Suite-For-Education.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 262px) 100vw, 262px">The most successful colonizer has been Google. A recent report indicates that Google’s <em>G-Suite for Education</em> is being used by half the teachers and students in the U.S. Canada is fast approaching the same level of use. It includes a range of free software tools that can be used by students and teachers—word processing, presentations, spread sheets and the like. G-Suite incorporates “Classroom,” an integrated learning management system that keeps track of grades, attendance and more. And, of course, YouTube is linked to student use.</p>
<p>New elements are added frequently. “Google Sites” is promoted for student e-portfolios, because “every student should publish for the world.” Google acquired Workbench, integrated with Google Classroom to give “lessons connected to a variety of ‘maker’ activities focused on STEM.” It is part of Google’s plan to “help schools and educators address their universal needs around education content.”</p>
<p>Google, rather than democratic public institutions, therefore shapes what is on offer. Google’s position as colonizer is strengthened by the hardware increasingly used in schools—the Google Chromebook. <img src="http://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/CB_canada.max-1000x1000-400x222.png" alt="" width="346" height="192" srcset="https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/CB_canada.max-1000x1000-400x222.png 400w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/CB_canada.max-1000x1000-768x425.png 768w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/CB_canada.max-1000x1000.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px">It is less expensive than other computers because much of what it needs to operate is supplied by Google in the cloud—operating software, applications and memory. No need to build those into the computer.&nbsp; According to market reports, Chromebooks make up the majority of all computers sold to schools in the U.S. and are marketed globally.</p>
<p>However, one must have a gmail account to use these Google tools—so if a parent wants to protect the privacy of their child and refuses a gmail account that kid is left out while the rest of the class works away on their Chromebook and other Google tools. (See <a href="http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/4497822/GAFE-Information-Letter-and-Consent-Form-page2.pdf">here</a> the kind of consent form parents are asked to sign, giving Google access to acquire and store student information outside of Canada.)</p>
<p><img src="http://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2018-12-31-at-4.20.52-PM-400x70.png" alt="" width="657" height="115" srcset="https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2018-12-31-at-4.20.52-PM-400x70.png 400w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2018-12-31-at-4.20.52-PM-768x135.png 768w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2018-12-31-at-4.20.52-PM-1024x180.png 1024w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2018-12-31-at-4.20.52-PM.png 1238w" sizes="(max-width: 657px) 100vw, 657px"></p>
<p>Google has even taken up teaching “internet safety,” with a program aimed at reaching 5 million students. Its core is a game for students in Grades three to six to teach them to avoid “schemers, hackers and other bad actors.” However, as critics point out, it doesn’t talk about privacy concerns when users’ personal information and actions are tracked online. Google conveniently ignores its role as a “bad actor.”</p>
<p>A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1474904116654917">Swedish study </a>of Google’s strategy concluded that “By making an implicit demarcation between two concepts (your) ‘data’ and (collected) ‘information’ Google can disguise the presence of a business model for online marketing and, at the same time, simulate the practices and ethics of a free public service institution.”</p>
<p>In “<a href="http://2017trends.hackeducation.com/data.html">The Weaponization of Education Data</a>,” Audrey Watters points out “the risk isn’t only hacking.&nbsp; It’s amassing data in the first place. It’s profiling. It’s tracking. It’s surveilling.”</p>
<p>Google isn’t alone in the business of colonizing education and student data—just the most successful so far. One competitor is Microsoft 365 Education, with a promise of “empowering every student on the planet to achieve more” and that it will “unlock limitless learning.”</p>
<p>It’s not an accident that it is “Microsoft 365” that is being pushed. It offers a cloud-based software and cloud storage for your work. It is the new business model for Microsoft: they don’t sell you software, you rent it—and you keep paying for it. And your work isn’t saved on your own computer, so you have to keep up your subscription. Like Google, they are hoping that students will keep using their tools when they finish being students.</p>
<p>Microsoft is imitating much of what Google offers, but by charging for the service rather than trading it for data. It offers apps, educator training and STEM lessons “to enrich science, technology, engineering and math classes.” They offer “budget friendly” Windows 10 devices with licences for Microsoft 365 Education.</p>
<p>The other major tech corporations have programs as well. Apple, for example, was the first into education with the Apple IIe and the “Apple Classroom of Tomorrow” way back in the 1980s. More recently it depended on the ease of use of the iPad, despite its cost, to sell classroom sets along with Pearson curriculum in an <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/05/los-angeles-edtech/">ill-fated project with Los Angeles schools</a>.</p>
<p>Venture capitalists are hoping to find the magic app that will make a fortune. The potential market is indicated by expenditure of hundreds of millions each year on developing new products. The “winners” are likely to be bought up by one of the major corporations—or find their product idea taken by the monopolies.</p>
<p>Not enough attention is paid by education authorities or researchers to the shaping and distortion of education that is possible—even likely—by this colonization of education by technology monopolies.</p>

<span>DESCRIPTION</span>              
     <span>VisiData</span> is an easy-to-use multipurpose tool to explore, clean, edit, and restructure          
     data. Rows can be selected, filtered, and grouped; columns can be rearranged, trans-           
     formed, and derived via regex or Python expressions; and workflows can be saved, doc-          
     umented, and replayed.

<p>I used <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb</a> for years in Russia, Germany, and the United States. All the time, the experience was great. At some point, I read a <a href="https://amzn.to/3o9JywH">book about Airbnb</a> to understand the company better.</p>

<p>For Thanksgiving week (November 21-29), five of my friends and I rented a house in Las Vegas.</p>

<p>The total price for nine days: <strong>$2543</strong>.</p>

<p>Previously people went to Vegas to spend time in casinos or walk on The Strip. This year, <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">the pandemic</a> made it impossible.</p>

<p>It was not a problem for us. We did not plan to socialize; we were going rock climbing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105731932/red-rock">Red Rocks</a>, located next to Vegas, is an excellent place for traditional, sport, bouldering, multi-pitch climbing.</p>

<p>The plan was for some people to take days off and climb every day, and for others to work three days remotely and join the gang during the rest.</p>

<h2 id="incident">Incident</h2>

<p>We moved in on Saturday night. The next morning, excited, we woke up at 6am, had breakfast, verified that we closed back and front doors and at 7am drove to the Red Rocks Park.</p>

<p>We had a fantastic day of climbing, but after the sunset, we went home to realize that the window in one of the rooms was open and some of our belongings had disappeared.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Three work Macbook Pro (I do not include the price, they are replaced by our employees for free)</li>
  <li>One personal <a href="https://amzn.to/33uWB3F">Macbook Pro</a> ($1550)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/2JCZWqE">Oculus Quest 2</a>. I just bought it. Really cool. Wanted to share the experience. ($399)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/2VnyrUt">GoPro Hero 6</a> ($194)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/36oMMGz">Lenovo Tab 4, 10.1in Android Tablet</a> ($190)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3lms9is">Sony WH1000XM3 Noise Cancelling Headphones</a> ($348)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3qbPNSm">Bose Quietcontrol 30 Wireless Headphones</a> ($169)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3fVzzIh">Bose Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Headphones 700</a> ($339)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/37qgsSN">BlueTooth ledger</a> ($118)</li>
  <li>Two backpacks. (2 x $100)</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kz/an/pd/kzanpdzeno_6rkrjjgbrhbscbbs.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>I called the host, told her about the situation. She shared a set of images from the cameras and the next day sent the whole video.</p>

  </p>

<p>We believe this is what happened:</p>

<p>At 8:55am, two hours after we left, someone</p>
<ol>
  <li>Openly came to the front door.</li>
  <li>Knocked in the door.</li>
  <li>Waved Lexus car keys at the camera. (We do not have Lexus.)</li>
  <li>Ringed the bell.</li>
  <li>Waited to verify that no one was at home.</li>
  <li>Got to the back of the house.</li>
  <li>Put gloves and balaclava on.</li>
  <li>Checked if the back door was open. It was not.</li>
  <li>Checked if he can open the window. And it was possible.
10 Moved the pool chair below the window.</li>
  <li>Got into the house.</li>
</ol>

<p>We called the police, and in two hours an officer came. He was polite and professional. He got the list of the stolen items, our version of the incident in the written form, and left.</p>

<p>I was curious, how did the burglar open the window? I checked, and the answer was simple: <strong>the lock on the window was not operational.</strong> No need to break anything, anyone can open the window from the outside!</p>

<p>If the weather was warmer, we would probably try to open windows the night we came. In that case we would discover the problem, but the night was cold and we did not touch the windows.</p>

<p>Till this moment, I was chill. Bad things happen. Burglars get into houses, and no one could be protected from it. We were safe in this incident, and from the money perspective, our loss was not huge.</p>

<p>But the fact that the lock on that window was not functioning is an issue (few more windows had the same problem). If the front door lock was broken it would be worse but even windows that could not be locked are sketchy.</p>

<p>In general, I prefer to blame myself for bad things that happen to me. This time I cannot figure out what was my fault. For sure, we could check all the locks in the house, but it is an overkill.</p>

<p>I am ok with making mistakes and paying for them. But this time, we paid for the host’s errors and Airbnb’s as a company.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Host</strong>: the house was not ready for hosting the guests.</li>
  <li><strong>Airbnb</strong>: limitations of the onboarding policy. I believe there is a list of things that the house owner needs to mark to become a host, and either functioning window locks are not on the list, or it is not enforced.</li>
</ul>

<p>After we told the host about our discovery, she sent a person to lock all the windows completely. From now on, no one would be able to open them from inside or outside.</p>



<p>I wanted to reach out to Airbnb, tell them about the situation, and ask about the next steps.</p>

<p>Safety comes first. Hence I assumed that even if you are under stress and your brain is not functioning well, it is obvious how to contact the support team.</p>

<p>To my surprise, it is not the case.</p>

<p>I spent some time on the Airbnb website but could not figure out which phone number I should call.</p>

<p><strong>Message to AirBnb</strong>: It would be great if you simplify the design of the support page. When we talk about safety, it should be about efficiency and not about the visual appeal or cuteness level.</p>

<p>I would like it to be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I open the Airbnb website =&gt; I see an obvious button/link to the support page.</li>
  <li>I open the support page =&gt; I see an obvious button/link to the hotline phone number.</li>
</ul>

<p>I posted the tweet about the incident and tagged Airbnb and Las Vegas police in it.</p>

<blockquote>— Vladimir Iglovikov (@viglovikov) <a href="https://twitter.com/viglovikov/status/1330741490759266304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>A miracle happened. Airbnb contacted me and asked for my email to identify the account and to get more details.</p>

<p>My guess is that the Marketing team at Airbnb has alarms that trigger when someone mentions the company on social media.</p>

<p>Finally, after two hours, we got into the conversation about the incident, but the path to get there was not obvious at all.</p>

<p>Imagine how many people got into trouble in similar situations and did not leverage this communication channel?</p>

<p>I got an email:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My name is XXX, from the Airbnb claims team.</p>

  <p>I am contacting you regarding the incident that occurred during your reservation with YYY.</p>

  <p>As my colleague informed you in the previous email, we are only able to offer up to $500 for any stolen property. In order to proceed with this refund, I will need the following:</p>

  <p>*Original purchase invoice for the stolen items.</p>

  <p>This is requested as “proof of ownership”, if you don’t have the original purchase invoice, a picture of you where the item can be seen will also be accepted as proof of ownership.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All this story is not about money. But getting compensated for the host’s and Airbnb’s mistake with cash or AirBnB credits would be nice. It does not address the issue with window locks but sweetens the situation.</p>

<p>We interpreted the email as: “We will compensate up to $500 per stolen item”. Using the numbers from the invoices, it summed to $2600.</p>

<p>We collected invoices, sent them to Airbnb, and got the reply with words: “After additional review, I’m happy to report that we have just released a payout in the amount of $500 to your Airbnb account. You can confirm in your Airbnb Transaction History.”</p>

<p>The guess about up to $500 per item was overly optimistic.</p>

<p>After the end of the stay, I got a message from the host:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hi Vladimir,</p>

  <p>Thank you again for choosing our home for your vacation stay.</p>

  <p>I hope the home met (and even surpassed) your expectations. It was a sincere pleasure hosting you, and I really hope to host you again in the near future. I would be truly grateful for a 5 star review of your stay when you have a spare moment and I would definitely do the same for you.</p>

  <p>Also, please in the private comments if there is something, the home or myself can approve of please let me know.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand that this is a standard template, but under the circumstances, it sounds strange and
does not fit the story and overall experience.</p>

<p>I did not plan to share the actual address of the property. The harm to the renting business could be material. But after this text, I changed my mind. It does not look like the host plans to revise the house and look for things that can and should be fixed. For example, the front door lock is barely working. The door could be open with a good push.</p>



<p>We had a great vacation. The weather was good, and the red rocks are remarkable. We had a lot of fun and plan to come back sometime soon.</p>

<p>Work laptops were replaced. We accepted the loss of personal items.</p>

<p>The Airbnb experience was not as smooth as we expected. Our things got stolen, and even on the other days, we did not feel comfortable leaving belongings in the house.</p>

<p>The host was responsive, but it is not enough. Communicating with guests and collecting money should not be the only responsibility. It is worth inspecting the house and fixing things that do not work as expected proactively, without waiting till the universe gives you feedback.</p>

<p>Overall, I believe that staying at AirBnB is safe, and such incidents are the exception rather than the rule, but, for sure, Airbnb has some work to do to improve communication and increase the guests’ safety. The compensation of $500 for all the stolen items does not look fair either.</p>

<p>I would like to end the story with some action items like: “<strong>Next time, when I rent a place, I will do XXX</strong>.” Nothing reasonable comes to my mind.</p>

<p>When I sit in front of the computer in San Francisco, the only thing that comes to my mind is to build a Face Recognition system and check the burglar’s face in it. Something similar to Clearview. Machine Learning is my expertise; creating such a system is straightforward but will take some time. Tempting. Thinking about it.</p>

<p>What would be your action item after such an experience?</p>

<p>In Segmentâ€™s early days, we hit countless problems as a founding team. And at the time, I thought those problems were unique to our own special snowflake of a founding journey. I chalked it up to us being new grads and first-time founders.</p><p>But as I've worked with more and more startups, I've realized just how wrong I was.</p><p>Over the past five years, I've made about 25 different seed-stage investments. In doing so, it's taught me a <em>LOT</em> about the common errors that startup founders make. Even across different industries and levels of experience, I see founders hitting the exact same set of problems we encountered in the early days of Segment!</p><p>This post shares a handful of the top lessons that benefit todayâ€™s early stage founders. Itâ€™s a list of the things I wish weâ€™d figured out earlier at Segment. [1]</p><p>This sounds incredibly boring... but the #1 mistake I see startups making is that they donâ€™t set goals. If you take one thing from this post, it's that you should set goals for where you want to be.</p><p>For the longest time at Segment, we didn't have goals. We moved ahead in various (often random) directions, and we would launch features consistently... but we never really set goals at all.</p><p>As we grew the company, we started to lose momentum. Teams were spending time on a bunch of stuff that frankly just didn't really matter to the overall business.</p><p>It wasn't until we hired our VP Eng, Tido, that we finally started setting focused and audacious product goals. Just by verbalizing where we wanted to go and then grading our results, our velocity improved by an order of magnitude.</p><p>I don't care if you call them OKRs, sprints, or something else entirely. Just set a deadline when you want to have something done and a metric you want to move or some other concrete result.</p><p>When early stage founders do attempt to set goals, I often see them agonize over what specific goals to choose. In practice, a "pretty good goal" is way better than "no goals at all". Perfect is the enemy of good.</p><p>If you don't yet have product-market fit, your goal should probably be getting your first 3-5 customers using the product. If you've hit the level where you now have dozens of users, your goal should be growing by an order of magnitude. It's better to get in the habit of setting and driving towards goals rather than being too worried about their exact semantics. Worst case, you just pick a better goal later.</p><p>A great set of goals answers the question: <em><strong>"what would have to be true in order for us to feel good about our progress at the end of the month?"</strong></em><em> [2]</em></p><p>If each teammate can independently answer "what are our goals for the month?" in the same way, you'll know you've succeeded. If youâ€™re looking for prior art, read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Measure-What-Matters-Google-Foundation/dp/0525536221">Measure What Matters</a>. </p><p>If you strictly focus on making things true by a certain date, you are bound to make at least some progress towards your end result. </p><p>At the end of the day, every billion-dollar startup is really just the sum of many small deltas.</p><p>Let's get one thing straight: your investors won't know everything. But investors won't know <em>anything</em> if you don't keep them updated on how things are going.</p><p>For the longest time, we were fearful of our Segment investors, to the point that we wouldn't bother sending them emails unless they asked about us. I can say now with confidence that this was 100% the wrong approach.</p><p>We worried that investors would think that we were screwing up (true) and failing (true as well!). And while that might be the case, a founder-friendly investor won't think that way. Investors, especially angels, invested because they believe in <em>you</em>. If I didn't think a team would go somewhere, I wouldn't put money in.</p><p>With each investor, <strong>include the goals you're working towards, as well as the asks for them</strong>. I think monthly is about the right cadence for this in the early days, moving to quarterly around Series A/B time when you start partnering more with a few board members.</p><p>Simply writing the updates should clarify your own thinking tremendously. If it takes you more than 1-2h to put together an update on the most important things happening at the company, it's probably a sign that you should be doing more thinking about the big picture.</p><p>When asking for help, the things that our investors have been able to help us with evolved quite a bit over time. But here's a good rule of thumb for what to ask for:</p><ul><li><p><u>Seed/Pre-seed</u>: user-testing, intros to beta users, hiring</p></li><li><p><u>Series A</u>: hiring, early customers, go-to-market</p></li><li><p><u>Series B/C+</u>: comparables at other companies, senior/exec hires, specific expertise around things like management, infrastructure, systems, etc.</p></li></ul><p>Not all investors will be able to help with everything. But at the very least, sending them information will help you be top of mind. I've lost track of how many times a moment of serendipity where I'm catching up with an old friend has led to a meaningful conversation for a company I've invested in.</p><p>As an extra bonus, the strongest startups send these updates to everyone on their team. It's amazing how much putting the goals in writing helps everyone stay on the same page about what's most important.</p><p>One other note here: take pictures. I now wish we had far more pictures of Segment at every stage of the company. They help turn investor updates into cherished memories.</p><p>Okay, this lesson is taken directly from the YC playbook. And YET, I see so many founders (including YC founders) fail to launch their product. </p><p>If no one notices your launch... just ignore it and then launch again. If you're doing things right, you'll never run out of stuff to launch! [3]</p><p>Why is launching so important? Let me share a personal story...</p><p>We spent about 1.5 years building different iterations of analytics tools. For every iteration, we had a waitlist that users could sign up to use. We personally reached out to the users who we thought were the best fits, and then tried to set up time to use the product. </p><p>The result? Nobody cared. We had no users. We never launched. </p><p>When we finally launched Segment in it's current incarnation, we threw out that approach entirely. We put up a self-service flow, and let anyone who wanted to sign up for it.</p><p>That's when something strange happened... we attracted an entirely new set of developers who just were crawling out of the woodwork and excited to use the new product we'd built. They were coming from companies far outside of SV that we'd never heard of.</p><p>It floored me.</p><p><strong>Lesson learned: the people you happen to be talking to now are probably not the people who have the biggest problem in your space. Do everything you can to reach the folks with the biggest problem, and then, reduce any barriers they might encounter.</strong></p><p>I expect a bunch of you reading this post to ignore this advice, just like we did in the early days. It takes a certain confidence to launch something you've built and put it out there for the world to see. Ultimately though, the rewards are worth it. You'll see users coming from communities you've never even heard of.</p><p>Let me tell you a tale of two startups.</p><p><strong>Startup A</strong> is constantly putting up interesting content on their blog. Their founders are sharing product launches, engineering posts, and creatively brainstorming about what it takes to solve problems in their market.</p><p><strong>Startup B</strong> is operating in stealth. You can't find much about them online, but one of the founders reached out with a nice personalized email mentioning their funding by a top-tier VC. </p><p>Suppose you're looking for a job... do you pick Startup A or Startup B? In my experience, A almost always wins. Momentum is a compounding force.</p><p><strong>Unless you are working in a space that heavily depends on IP, you should probably be publishing more content about what you are doing.</strong> This could be open source, it could be a weekly newsletter, it could be a changelog. [4]</p><p>Whatever it is, it's going to help you both hire <em>and</em> attract customers. So much of the internet is merely about consuming, that just by putting ideas out there, youâ€™ll have a leg up on the competition.</p><p>In the early days of Segment, our <a href="https://segment.com/blog/show-hn-to-series-d/">user acquisition was powered by open source projects and blog posts</a>. But I've seen founders have success with Twitter, Substacks, Podcasts and a variety of different channels.</p><p>If you're looking for inspiration, the <a href="https://railway.app/changelog">Railway</a> and <a href="https://linear.app/changelog">Linear</a> changelogs are epic examples. Companies like <a href="https://baremetrics.com/blog/i-sold-baremetrics">Baremetrics</a> and <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/shareholder-update-q2-2020-and-july/">Buffer</a> differentiated themselves by just being open and honest. <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/globe">Stripe</a> and <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/behind-the-feature-the-making-of-the-new-auto-layout/">Figma's blogs</a> not only share what they build, but how they built it.</p><p>There are three big inputs that all startups need to continue growing</p><ol><li><p>product capabilities</p></li><li><p>customers and users</p></li><li><p>hiring</p></li></ol><p>I've put them in roughly the order that most teams encounter them. </p><p>Startups begin with a small product that has a modicum of utility. It starts attracting a handful of customers organically. And as more and more customers start using the product, the founders realize that they need extra help to stay on top of all of those requests.</p><p>Remember though, the real goal here is #2. Itâ€™s not the size of your team, itâ€™s the value youâ€™re able to provide to the world. [5]</p><p>I see hiring a big team before you have product-market fit as a red flag. If the company doesn't yet have a set direction, it's going to be harder to pivot with 10 people than it is with 3.</p><p>But, I've worked with startups who have traction and runway... and just seem to be spinning their wheels under load from existing customers.</p><p>I get it. Hiring isn't the most fun, especially for an introvert. It's a lot of interviewing and feeling like there's a lot of rejection. Rejecting people sucks. Losing candidates sucks. For many of our roles at Segment, we've had to talk with 50-100 different people to make an eventual hire.</p><p><strong>If you have 24 months of runway, and a clear list of things youâ€™d do if you had more copies of yourself: you probably aren't spending time to hire the people you need.</strong></p><p>At Segment, my co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/ivolo">Ilya</a> fulfilled this role. It was back in 2014, we were 12 people at the time, had raised a $10m Series A, and had $1m in revenue.</p><p>Thing…</p></div></div>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Semantic scene understanding is crucial for robust and safe autonomous navigation, particularly so in off-road environments. Recent deep learning advances for 3D semantic segmentation rely heavily on large sets of training data; however, existing autonomy datasets represent urban environments or lack multimodal off-road data. We fill this gap with RELLIS-3D, a multimodal dataset collected in an off-road environment containing annotations for <strong>13,556 LiDAR scans</strong> and <strong>6,235 images</strong>. The data was collected on the Rellis Campus of Texas A\&amp;M University and presents challenges to existing algorithms related to class imbalance and environmental topography. Additionally, we evaluate the current state of the art deep learning semantic segmentation models on this dataset. Experimental results show that RELLIS-3D presents challenges for algorithms designed for segmentation in urban environments. Except for the annotated data, the dataset also provides full-stack sensor data in ROS bag format, including <strong>RGB camera images</strong>, <strong>LiDAR point clouds</strong>, <strong>a pair of stereo images</strong>, <strong>high-precision GPS measurement</strong>, and <strong>IMU data</strong>. This novel dataset provides the resources needed by researchers to develop more advanced algorithms and investigate new research directions to enhance autonomous navigation in off-road environments.</p>

<h3 id="ontology">Ontology:</h3>
<p>With the goal of providing multi-modal data to enhance autonomous off-road navigation, we defined an ontology of object and terrain classes, which largely derives from <a href="http://rugd.vision/">the RUGD dataset</a> but also includes unique terrain and object classes not present in RUGD. Specifically, sequences from this dataset includes classes such as mud, man-made barriers, and rubble piles. Additionally, this dataset provides a finer-grained class structure for water sources, i.e., puddle and deep water, as these two classes present different traversability scenarios for most robotic platforms. Overall, 20 classes (including void class) are present in the data.</p>

December 5, 2020 | https://blog.streetwriters.co/how-to-write-good-metaphors/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.streetwriters.co/how-to-write-good-metaphors/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Metaphors are everywhere;&nbsp;in literature, visual arts, poetry, and films. Language, in a way, itself&nbsp;is a metaphor. But try to make one on the fly, and you will find out it is not easy. Creating a metaphor requires ingenuity and care. A small mistake can make a metaphor clumsy. So how does one write a good metaphor?&nbsp;Let’s find out.</p><h2>Why Metaphors are Important</h2><p>Metaphors make us understand things better. When feelings are involved or when something happens which has no proper words in our vocabulary, we need something to communicate our experience. Metaphors come in handy in such situations. For example, author F. Scott Fitzgerald wanted to describe good writing. He could simply say that good writing was hard or good writing is very difficult. But he chose to say it like this:</p><p><em>All good writing is swimming underwater and holding your breath.</em></p><p>The metaphor&nbsp;“swimming underwater while holding breath” opens a door for us into the experience of Fitzgerald as a writer. That was a very difficult thing to convey in plain words. A whole paragraph might have not sufficed. But here a metaphor has conveyed the meaning completely in a single sentence. Metaphors help us convey meaning by using similarities in different objects and experiences. They relate things with one another and the result is a new understanding of a certain thing. All good poetry and literature do this to create new meanings. Another example is this beautiful metaphor by Shakespeare:</p><blockquote><p>All the world's a stage,<br>And all the men and women merely players;<br>They have their exits and their entrances;<br>And one man in his time plays many parts.</p><p><em>As You Like It</em>, William Shakespeare</p></blockquote><p>Metaphors help us use all of our senses in reading a sentence. They make the experience of language more immersive. Take this sentence as an example:</p><blockquote><p>Time has not stood still. It has washed over me, washed me away as if I'm nothing more than a woman of sand, left by a careless child too near the water.</p><p><em>The Handmaid's Tale</em>, Margaret Atwood</p></blockquote><p>The writer could simply have said that time has changed me. But the use of sand and water as metaphors has given the whole experience a life of its own. We can hear in our minds the sound of waves when reading the sentence. We can imagine a woman of sand. Therefore, metaphors give a deeper meaning to our words. They can convey meanings for which sometimes whole pages are necessary and sometimes even a book is not enough.</p><blockquote><p>I'm a little pencil in the hand of a writing God.</p><p>Mother Teresa</p></blockquote><p>In this small sentence, Mother Teresa has conveyed the whole of her faith. We can get a glimpse of her intimate relationship with God. We can sense her metaphysical experience. This was not possible without the use of a metaphor.</p><p>Along with that, plain words can be boring for our minds. Our minds hate repetitiveness and mundaneness and loves newness and ingenuity. Metaphors give us this freshness and livens ordinary language. Language becomes more interesting.</p><blockquote><p>She herself is a haunted house. She does not possess herself; her ancestors sometimes come and peer out of the windows of her eyes and that is very frightening.</p><p><em>The Bloody Chamber, </em>Angela Carter</p></blockquote><p>Simply saying that there is an eerie feeling attached to her the writer could have told us about the character but using a metaphor makes it more interesting and memorable. In addition to that, Metaphors add vagueness and abstractedness to our language. This gives readers free rein to make their own interpretations.</p><blockquote><p><em>There's a bluebird in my heart that<br></em><em>wants</em><em> to get out<br></em><em>but</em><em> I'm too tough for him,<br></em><em>I say, stay in there, I'm not going<br></em><em>to</em><em> let anybody see<br></em><em>you</em><em>.</em></p><p><em>Bluebird</em>, Charles Bukowski</p></blockquote><p>Nobody has a clear idea of what the bluebird is in this poem and so people make their interpretations. Metaphors give us the freedom to read works in the context of our own Worldview.</p><h2>How to Write Good Metaphors?</h2><p>First of all, start thinking about the thing or experience you want to express. Concentrate on the idea and think about it deeply. Understand it thoroughly. How do you feel about the whole idea?</p><p>For example, you want to describe the scene of someone waking up for the first time to the sound of the coming train. Lean into the experience of someone peacefully sleeping in a cozy room under blankets in a comfy bed. Now imagine a train passing over with an ear-shattering sound. What will the character feel like? Imagine it. Now can you compare it to something else that is similar in its sudden experience?</p><p>For me, the scene of a car suddenly breaking through the bedroom wall is similar so I would construct my metaphor around that imagery.</p><p><em>He woke up and thought a car had crashed in his bedroom. Everything was moving. His heart was pumping. "Oh! It's the train!" he let out a sigh and shook his head.</em></p><p>Secondly, try using original metaphors in your writing or ones that are rare. Commonly used metaphors are dead in a sense. Some dead metaphors are given here as an example:</p><ul><li>It's raining cats and dogs.</li><li>I'm visiting an old flame.</li><li>He's loose cannon.</li><li>She found herself behind the eight balls.</li><li>He drives me up a wall.</li><li>She saw the light at the end of the tunnel.</li><li>Ticking time bomb</li><li>Tip of the iceberg</li><li>Slippery slope</li><li>Going the extra mile</li><li>Early bird</li><li>Icy personality</li><li>Turning in one's grave</li><li>About to explode (from anger)</li></ul><p>Here are some more complex examples of metaphors. Read them carefully so you can get an idea of how a metaphor works.</p><p><em>1. Books are the mirrors of the soul.</em></p><p>Virginia Woolf describes here the connection between an author and his/her books. Books describe the inner thoughts of the author's mind. That is an experience similar to seeing one's soul. A mirror reflects everything that is in front of it. It does not lie. This small sentence combines these two concepts perfectly to convey a beautiful meaning.</p><p>2. <em>"</em><em>But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun!"</em></p><p>Shakespeare is trying to describe the feeling of love that Romeo had for Juliet. The sun is a classic metaphor used in ancient literature to describe a lover.</p><p>3. <em>The parents looked upon Matilda in particular as nothing more than a scab. A scab is </em><em>something you have to put up with until the time comes when you can pick it off and flick </em><em>it away.</em></p><p>The author here depicts the anger Matilda's parents felt for their child using “a scab on skin”. A person puts up with it because it's painful and messy to remove it before time.</p><p>4. <em>"O Lord, You are our Father, We are the clay, and You, our potter; And all of us are the work of Your hand."</em></p><p>In this verse of the Bible, the feeling of helplessness and the might of the All-Mighty God is described. Helplessness is compared with the inertness of the clay. And the potter's hands are the workings of God.</p><p>5. <em>Alas,</em><em> and yet what are you, my written and painted thoughts! It is not long ago that you were still so many-</em><em>coloured</em><em>, young, and malicious, so full of thorns and hidden spices you made me sneeze and laugh and now? You </em><em>have already taken off your novelty and some of you, I fear, are on the point of becoming truths: they already look so immortal, so pathetically righteous, so boring! And has it ever been otherwise? For what things do we write and paint, we mandarins with </em><em>Chinese brushes, we immortalizers of things which let themselves </em><em>be</em><em> written, what alone are we capable of painting? Alas, only that which is about to wither and is beginning to lose its fragrance! Alas, only storms departing exhausted and feelings grown old and yellow! Alas, only birds strayed and grown weary in flight </em><em>who</em><em> now let themselves be caught in the hand in our hand! We immortalize that which cannot live and fly much longer, weary and mellow things alone! And it is only your afternoon, my written and painted thoughts, for which alone I have the </em><em>colours</em><em>, many </em><em>colours</em><em> perhaps, many many-</em><em>coloured</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>tendernesses</em><em> and fifty yellows and browns and greens and reds: but no one will divine from these how you looked in your morning, you sudden sparks and wonders of my solitude, you my old beloved wicked thoughts!</em></p><p>Here Nietzsche is describing the thoughts in the human mind which are immortal, ever-changing with infinite possibilities, and how impossible it is to define them truly words.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Good metaphors spice up any piece of art, be it a painting or a poem or a novel. Some writers use whole characters as forms of metaphors, others use symbolism. Learning to write a good metaphor can be a difference between a good piece and a great piece.

<p>This question often pops up, when you need a random direction vector to place things in 3D or you want to do a particle simulation.</p>



<p>We recall that a 3D unit-sphere (and hence a direction) is parametrized only by two variables; elevation <span data-display="false">\theta \in [0; \pi]</span> and azimuth <span data-display="false">\varphi \in [0; 2\,\pi]</span> which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system#Coordinate_system_conversions">can be converted to Cartesian coordinates as</a></p>



<p><span data-display="false">\begin{aligned}  x &amp;= \sin\theta \, \cos\varphi \\  y &amp;= \sin\theta \, \sin\varphi \\  z &amp;= \cos\theta \end{aligned} </span></p><p>If one takes the easy way and uniformly samples this parametrization in numpy like</p>



<pre><code>phi = np.random.rand() * 2 * np.pi
theta = np.random.rand() * np.pi</code></pre>



<p>One (i.e. you as you are reading this) ends with something like this:</p>

<p>While the 2D surface of polar coordinates uniformly sampled (left), we observe a bias of sampling density towards the poles when projecting to the Cartesian coordinates (right).<br>The issue is that the cos mapping of the elevation has an uneven step size in <em>Cartesian</em> space, as you can easily verify: <span data-display="false">cos^{'}(x) = sin(x)</span>.</p>



<p>The solution is to simply sample the elevation in the Cartesian space instead of the spherical space – i.e. sampling <span data-display="false">z \in [-1; 1]</span>. From that we can get back to our elevation as <span data-display="false">\theta = \arccos z</span>:</p>



<pre id="block-6ecb681a-6f13-49b9-8783-cebd81f25d08"><code>z = 1 - np.random.rand() * 2 # convert rand() range 0..1 to -1..1
theta = np.arccos(z)</code></pre>



<p>As desired, this compensates the spherical coordinates such that we end up with uniform sampling in the Cartesian space:</p>

<h2>Custom opening angle</h2>



<p>If you want to further restrict the opening angle instead of sampling the full sphere you can also easily extend the above. Here, you must re-map the cos values from <span data-display="false">[1; -1]</span> to <span data-display="false">[0; 2]</span> as</p>



<pre id="block-f289f7b0-bd4e-4ad9-9ebc-38537536d919"><code>cart_range = -np.cos(angle) + 1 # maximal range in cartesian coords

<a id="intro1"></a></p><h2>2k20 - a potential crisis in 2020 </h2>
<p>Modern browsers in 2020 will expect to 
	"connect HTTPS" only using TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 (this assumes that support for 
	everything from SSLv3 to TLSv1.1 will be removed)</p>

<p>While browsers are constantly being updated because of their financial 
	use in everything from on-line purchases to on-line investing and banking, 
many web servers are not. What is worse it this: many organizations, including 
	governments large and small, are slow to update software</p>

<p><span>comment:</span> Firefox has been warning for several months 
(today is 2019-08-25) that one of my servers is preferentially offering 
connections via TLS-1.0 (the lock icon is closed but is orange). Chrome and IE11 
each present a green lock icon.</p>
<h3><a name="openvms"></a>The OpenVMS ecosystem</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Two companies are currently supporting OpenVMS (but this is about to 
	change)<ul>
		<li>In 2014, HP transferred the rights to develop/support OpenVMS to VSI 
		(<a href="https://www.vmssoftware.com/">VMS Software Inc</a>)</li>
		<li>In 2015, HP split into two companies: HP (most desktop products) and 
		HPE (enterprise)</li>
		<li>HPE continued to support OpenVMS software contracts sold to HP customers 
		before 2015 (they also sold/supported VSI products)</li>
		<li>Early in 2019, HPE removed most OpenVMS stuff (documentation as well 
		as software) from their website including CSWS-2.2-1 (<a href="http://neilrieck.net/docs/openvms_notes_apache.html">Compaq Secure Web Services</a>) 
	based upon <span>Apache 2.0.63</span><ul>
			<li>For example, this link:
			<a href="http://h41379.www4.hpe.com/openvms/products/ips/apache/csws.html">http://h41379.www4.hpe.com/openvms/products/ips/apache/csws.html</a> 
		previously provided both software-downloads and product documentation 
		but now diverts you to this common landing page:
			<a href="https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=a00058693en_us">https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=a00058693en_us</a> 
		(in fact, all HPE OpenVMS software links now drop you here)</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>If you have an OpenVMS support contract with HPE, then you will be 
		able to request the latest version of file MOD_SSL (an Apache module for 
		CSWS) which is based upon OpenSSL-1.0L but does not implement TLSv1.3<ul>
			<li>HPE has announced the end of all OpenVMS support by the end of 2020.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Businesses requiring <strong>CSWS/Apache on OpenVMS</strong> should immediately 
	move their support contracts over to VSI where you will have access to a new version of CSWS 
	based upon <span>Apache 2.4.12</span><ul>
			<li><span>caveat:</span> you may be required to update your OS to OpenVMS-8.4-2 so do not wait until the last minute</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>For companies and/or hobbyists financially unable to move to VMS 
	Software Inc., your the only remaining option is to replace CSWS/Apache with WASD HTTPd 
	(the high quality web server from down-under) which is not based upon 
	Apache.<ul>
		<li>WASD already supports TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3</li>
		<li>"I think" support agreements may be available</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>This web-page will document my efforts to replace CSWS/Apache with WASD 
	HTTPd on a sacrificial laboratory system (we employ a lot of CGI including one SOAP-based 
	feed)</li>

<h2><a name="intro2"></a>Introduction to WASD HTTPd</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://wasd.vsm.com.au/">WASD</a> HTTPd - is a very high quality free 
	web 
		server from <a href="http://www.vsm.com.au/">VSM Software 
	Services</a> in Australia<ul>
		<li>it runs on all VMS and OpenVMS platforms: <span>VAX, Alpha, and Itanium</span></li>
		<li>it will run on <span>x86-64</span> when VSI finally 
		publishes a OpenVMS-9 for that CPU architecture</li>
		<li>it is NOT based upon Apache</li>
		<li>it is published with all the source code so if you can program 
			in C then you can improve/extend/tinker</li>
		<li>it can link to its own SSL libraries which already support TLS-1.3, or HP-SSL (based upon 
		OpenSSL-0.9 and lower), or HP-SSL1 (OpenSSL-1.0 and higher)</li>
		<li>excerpt from page-13 of the book <strong>OpenVMS with Apache, OSU, and WASD</strong>
		<p>
				The idea with WASD was to be a really good VMS-only server: Mark Daniel says, "I 
suffered a bit of a VMS cringe when amongst my UNIX colleagues (VMS was perceived 
to be a bit slow and cumbersome), so I have also endeavored to make WASD as fast 
and efficient as I could, avoiding C run-time library and even RMS code layers 
where it was feasible and worth it. I also wanted a similarly tight scripting 
environment and have spent a lot of time honing this aspect"</p>
		</li>
		<li><span>Trivia:</span> <strong>WASD</strong> = "Wide Area 
		Surveillance Division". WASD was previously known as <strong>HFRD</strong> 
		(High Frequency Radar Division) of Australia's Defense, Science and 
		Technology Organization</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<div>
	<p><strong><a id="executive"></a>Executive Summary</strong>:
	</p><ul>
		<li>What an unexpected surprise. WASD HTTPd is the fastest web server I 
		have worked on to date.<br>I am currently supporting web servers on these 
		production platforms...<table>

		</tbody></table>...and it appears that 
		WASD on the oldest hardware is able to out-perform Apache on the newest 
		hardware (caveat: I 
		haven't done any full-load stress tests just yet)</li>
		<li>WASD HTTPd is published with all the source code. This means that if 
		Adelaide gets hit with an asteroid you will be able to fix your 
		own code (provided you have access to the DECC "C compiler)</li>
		<li>The source code is mirrored in at least three other locations (see 
		asteroid comment)</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<h2><a id="firststeps"></a>First Steps</h2>
<ul>
	<li>download all the zip files you think you will need from here: <a href="https://wasd.vsm.com.au/wasd/">
	https://wasd.vsm.com.au/wasd/</a> (or the various mirror sites)<ul>
		<li><span>caveat:</span> do not skip any CUP (cumulative 
		update package) files. I wasted a 
		whole day trying to get both Server Admin and SYSUAF to work (I assumed 
		I was doing something wrong). I was only successful after I noticed, 
		then installed, the CUP file (probably need new 
		eyeglasses) </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>none of these files offer executables so you will need to download a 
	vanilla package (necessary to "compile-link" or just "link") as well as the 
	architecture-specific files</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="unzip"></a>Unzip then install</h2>
<p>Unzip</p>
<pre>$! DCL script to unzip WASD
$! this is an rx2660 (Itanium2)
$! CSWS/Apache is located on disk dka200 so that's where I'll put WASD
$!
$ define/job yada CSMIS$USER3:[ADMCSM.NEIL._WASD]	! files where downloaded here
$ set default DKA200:[000000]				! move to root of disk dka200
$ unzip yada:WASD1130.zip				! also creates folder [WASD_ROOT}
$ unzip yada:WASD1130-ia64.zip				!
$ set default [WASD_ROOT]				!
$ unzip yada:<span>WASD_CUP_1130b.ZIP</span> 			! do not forget this (or SYSUAF stuff won't work)
$ unzip yada:opensslwasd102r-ia64.zip			! optional</pre>
<p>Install (part 1) you need a DEC-C compiler to do perform step 1 so consider 
starting with step 2</p><br>

                <h3 id="who-makes-up-the-fi-re-movement">Who makes up the FI/RE Movement?</h3><p>Despite its relatively recent popularity, the FI/RE movement is still in many ways ambiguous. Who are these millionaires next door and what common traits are shared among them? Fortunately based off of data obtained from a survey conducted of nearly 1,400 individuals in the r/financialindependence subreddit, we can get a bit more insight into not only those who are pursuing FI/RE, but also those who have already achieved it. Special thanks to u/melonbalon for conducting the survey in the first place!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure><img src="https://www.thriftythoughts.io/content/images/2020/12/UNCLAIMED-PROPERTY--7-.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.thriftythoughts.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/UNCLAIMED-PROPERTY--7-.png 600w, https://www.thriftythoughts.io/content/images/2020/12/UNCLAIMED-PROPERTY--7-.png 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="insights-obtained">Insights Obtained</h3><p>So much data was obtained as part of this survey and the figures reported in the above visual only scratch the surface of valuable insights that could be drawn. Of note however are a couple items:</p><ol><li><strong>Commute times are very low.</strong> Over 20% of respondents noted that it takes last than 10 minutes to get to work. Additionally, nearly 70% had a commute of less than 30 minutes. It's likely that these smaller commute times result in less transportation costs which could be a motivating factor.</li><li><strong>Individuals who have already FI/RE'd are highly educated.</strong> Not only did nearly 85% of respondents have a college degree, but an additional 7% had multiple graduate degrees. Perhaps these individuals have more time for additional schooling post-retirement. It also could be the case that this additional education helped them FI/RE in the first place. Regardless, more schooling was expected in comparison to the respondent group that had not yet FI/RE'd simply given the older average age. </li><li><strong>Respondents favored urban and suburban environments equally. </strong>Additionally this ratio remained constant in both the pursuing FI/RE and FI/RE'd populations. I would have expected far more suburban living, but perhaps the increased cost of living in an urban environment is offset enough by the reduced transportation costs to be appealing.</li></ol>

<p><strong>UPDATE: While these are valid reasons, <a href="https://www.arencambre.com/iphones-are-inferior-to-android-phones-the-value/">scoring them suggests I should still switch to the iPhone</a>.</strong></p>



<p>I am on day 10 of using an iPhone. I came from the Android world.</p>



<p>The iPhone is deficient. I am leaning towards returning it.</p>




<h2><span id="Context"></span>Context<span></span></h2>



<p>Ten days ago, I switched from a Pixel 4 XL to the iPhone 12 Pro Max. I went with this iPhone model because it’s similarly sized to the Pixel 4 XL, plus I value photography.</p>



<h3><span id="Why_I_switched"></span>Why I switched<span></span></h3>



<p>I made the switch due to intellectual curiosity, to overcome limitations of the Pixel 4 XL, and to get on board with the rest of my family.</p>



<p>I am questioning this decision. While the iPhone helps me escape two Pixel 4 XL limitations, iOS’s regressions from Android feel like a heavy burden.</p>



<p>I am inside Apple’s return window, so I can return the iPhone for a full refund. It is tempting.</p>



<h3><span id="Android_only_has_two_worthwhile_brands"></span>Android only has two worthwhile brands<span></span></h3>



<p>My analysis relies heavily on my experience with the Pixel 4 XL. Much of what I say about Android applies to to top-tier Android manufacturers. Among the requirements of top-tier manufacturers is they deliver highly vanilla Android. This includes <a href="https://store.google.com/us/magazine/compare_pixel">Pixel </a>(Google’s in-house brand), <a href="https://www.oneplus.com/">OnePlus</a>, and more.</p>



<p><strong>Samsung is not a top-tier phone manufacturer.</strong> Its hardware is decent, but it has bad software. Samsung replaces Android’s best features with <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00078945/">poor, fussy substitutes</a>. It also adds annoying, pointless bloat. In other words, just to differentiate its brand, it <em>devalues its brand </em>by trashing up its core software.</p>



<p>The Bixby assistant is the best example of Samsung’s stupidity. It’s awful. Samsung killing Bixby might signal that it’s ready to take Android seriously. Until then, Samsung is simply not a top-tier manufacturer.</p>



<p>The Samsung example is important because Apple is the same: <strong>great hardware, bad software</strong>.</p>



<h2><span id="A_note_about_definitions"></span>A note about definitions<span></span></h2>



<p>The article’s language is sometimes imprecise. Truly, if you’re comparing Android to something in the Apple ecosystem, it would be iOS. But that is not how people talk about their phones, so I am using loose terminology in places.</p>



<p>If you’re a True Nerd™ and find my word use upsetting, just associate my word with its parent ecosystem.</p>



<p>This is how several terms are correctly used:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Word category</strong></td><td><strong>Android phone ecosystem</strong></td><td><strong>Apple phone ecosystem</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Operating system</td><td>Android</td><td>iOS</td></tr><tr><td>Manufacturers</td><td>Google, OnePlus, and more</td><td>Apple</td></tr><tr><td>Phone brand</td><td>Pixel (Google), OnePlus, and more</td><td>iPhone</td></tr><tr><td>Phone model (current generation)</td><td>For Pixel: Pixel 4A, Pixel 4A 5G, Pixel 5. For OnePlus: OnePlus 8T, OnePlus 8 Pro, OnePlus 8, OnePlus 7T. There are more current model from other manufacturers.</td><td>iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max, iPhone SE, and more</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Also, some Android features I enjoy are Pixel-specific. While Google freely distributes Android to other manufactures, it reserves some newer features for its own Pixel phones. Sometimes I may mistakenly generalize a Pixel-specific feature as an Android feature. Since Pixel-specific features often eventually end up on other phones, associating Pixel with Android is probably correct in the long run.</p>



<h2><span id="Where_Android_is_better"></span>Where Android is better<span></span></h2>



<p>Android is well thought out. It has a great UX. I really miss its great design.</p>



<h3><span id="Call_screening_Android_wins"></span>Call screening: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>Android’s <a href="https://support.google.com/phoneapp/answer/9118387?hl=en">built-in call screener</a> is excellent. It blocks calls it is confident are garbage. If the caller is in a gray area, it will ask the caller first to state the reason for calling, then show that to me on the screen where I can accept the call. And even if does nothing to the call, I can still use a <strong>Screen Call </strong>button to kick the call to a digital assistant, where the caller is invited to state the reason for the call.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2019/11/call_screen_assistant.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Example call-screen opportunity. (This image shamelessly <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/automatic-call-screen-google-pixel-phones/">stolen</a> from XDA Developers.)</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This may be mostly a Pixel feature right now. Google plans to <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/09/08/google-phone-will-soon-be-downloadable-from-play-store-verified-calls-feature-rolling-out/">extend</a> this to more Android brands. Because Samsung uses its own, poor quality dialer, it’s unclear how Samsung will get this feature.</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> Apple only has a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207099">crude tool</a>: block callers not in your contacts. You can’t report calls or texts as spam.</p>



<p>If you want to be more selective than Apple’s crude tool, and instead block specific spammers, you must add the spammers to your contacts. That’s dumb; it just clutters your contacts!</p>



<p>You can also subscribe to a third party service. That’s grating, because the phone should manage that itself, given that this is a years-old problem.</p>



<h3><span id="Browser_ad_blocking_Android_wins"></span>Browser ad blocking: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>On Android, browser ad-blocking is easy: Switch to the free <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Mozilla Firefox browser</a>. Inside Firefox, add the free <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/">uBlock Origin extension</a>. Then set Firefox as your default browser for happy browsing. Simple! (Android’s Chrome browser does not support extensions.)</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> Install the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adguard-adblock-privacy/id1047223162">AdGuard app</a>, jump through several fussy hoops in the <strong>Settings </strong>console’s <strong>Safari </strong>area, and get nagged about going to paid AdGuard. </p>



<p>Maybe I am fussing too much. The hassle is a one-time step, and AdGuard seems to work decently.</p>



<p>Part of the point of ad-blocking is to make YouTube worthwhile. That leads to my next point…</p>



<h3><span id="YouTube_ad_blocking_Android_wins"></span>YouTube ad blocking: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>To block YouTube’s ads on Android, just view all YouTube content in Firefox with the uBlock Origin extension. Easy!</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> While Safari + AdGuard = ads blocked on YouTube, it’s still a major regression from Android:</p>



<ul><li>Video quality <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/aom6ge/why_does_youtube_only_go_up_to_720p_on_mobile/">maxes out at 720p</a>.</li><li>Every YouTube video in Safari starts as low quality (360p). To change it, on <em>every video you watch</em>, you must wade through the settings menu, and it has to be done before you switch to full screen, because of the next bullet’s deficiency.</li><li>When you’re viewing a video in a browser and switch to full screen, Apple cancels the website’s native video player and forces you to use iOS’s default, bad, native video player. Want to double-tap and skip 10 seconds? Want to access the site’s in-video settings? Want any feature not supported by iOS’s dumbed down video control? Forget it! iOS nukes it in full-screen mode.</li></ul>



<p>Firefox Focus is not a solution. It doesn’t fix iOS’s deficiencies.</p>



<h3><span id="Universal_back_button_Android_wins"></span>Universal back button: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>For at least a decade, Android has had a back button at the bottom of all windows. This means the valuable concept of “take me back” is baked into the Android paradigm. Need to return where you were, in <em>any</em> app? Just tap the back button, on bottom left of the screen. Or use the back gesture (next section).</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> The back button is a mess.</p>



<p>In Safari, it’s on bottom left.</p>



<p>In most other apps, top left.</p>



<p>To get to the prior app that sent you to the current app, find a tiny button between the app’s top-left back button and the clock. And good luck on that; too much of the time, iOS lists a wrong or irrelevant prior app, especially if you got to your current app from a system notification.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="449" src="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1024x449.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1024x449.png 1024w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-300x132.png 300w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-768x337.png 768w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image.png 1225w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Even though the mini back button says otherwise, I was not sent to GroupMe by NPR One! I was sent there by a notification I tapped while NPR One was active.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Even worse, because the non-Safari back buttons are on the opposite end of the phone from where you hold it, you’re less precise with finger positioning. Therefore, when you intend to use a “back” feature, you’ll instead make the phone think you’re trying to pull down the notification area.</p>



<h3><span id="Gestures_Android_wins"></span>Gestures: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>Building on its native strengths, Android’s <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6073614?hl=en">gestures</a> are excellent. They edge out iOS with the back gesture, which I use a lot. No matter what app you’re in, swipe in from the phone’s right to go back. Simple!</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> Without a “back” gesture, you’re stuck fumbling with iOS’s haphazard back buttons.</p>



<h3><span id="Exiting_apps_Android_wins"></span>Exiting apps: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>In Android, you can exit apps with the back gesture or swiping up from the bottom. The back gesture is superior, because it can’t be confused with other gestures.</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> Your only choice is the swipe-up gesture, which sometimes conflicts with normal swipes one does in apps.</p>



<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>I don’t literally mean app-exiting in the computer-science sense. I mean more in a common-parlance sense: you’re out of the app and back to the home screen, or in another app that may have called the current app. One an app is no longer visible, and running in the background, Android and iOS both do fine managing it.</p>



<h3><span id="Ambient_display_Android_wins"></span>Ambient display: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>The Pixel has a great feature: even when you’re not using the phone, it shows the current time on the screen, along with some other useful information. This takes minimal power: thanks to the OLED screen, the main power use is when it lights up the specific pixels that show the time.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="1024" src="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-768x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-768x1024.png 768w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-225x300.png 225w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-1152x1536.png 1152w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-1536x2048.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"><figcaption>Ambient display. This Pixel 4 XL is not active. It’s basically in sleep mode. It uses minimal power to give me useful information on its OLED screen.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> While the iPhone also has an OLED screen, Apple has no similar feature. You have to tap the phone to see the time, which lights up the whole screen.</p>



<h3><span id="Treating_me_like_an_adult_Android_wins"></span>Treating me like an adult: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>Android’s UX language is simply clean. It’s intuitive, simple, and it just works.</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> iOS’s UX feels like a cartoon spoof of a phone OS. Naturally garish colors, toddler-like corner-rounding, goofy font sizes, etc. It’s like iOS’s design semantics were intended to tussle with our innate senses. Barf!</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="473" height="1024" src="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-473x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-473x1024.png 473w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-139x300.png 139w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-768x1662.png 768w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-710x1536.png 710w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-947x2048.png 947w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2.png 1284w" sizes="(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px"><figcaption>When a toddler breaks out crayons and designs a phone, this is what you get.</figcaption></figure>



<h3><span id="Application_organization_Android_wins"></span>Application organization: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>All newly installed Android apps go into the app drawer. This is an alphabetized list of apps, accessed by swiping up from a home screen (when you’re not inside an app).</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4-485x1024.png" alt="" width="485" height="1024" srcset="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4-485x1024.png 485w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4-142x300.png 142w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4-768x1621.png 768w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4-728x1536.png 728w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4-970x2048.png 970w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4.png 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px"><figcaption>Android app drawer. Simple. Organized. Appropriate icon density.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Suppose you have 150 apps. That is 30 rows of five icons each, all in alpha sort. It’s fast to find any application.</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> It wasn’t until <em>this year</em> that Apple delivered its poor ripoff of the app drawer. Before then, people were stuck with jumbled messes of icons on multiple home-screen pages.</p>

          Since we are on such a tight deadline, I am soliciting donations of <strong>1000$ or more</strong> from the following organizations and people. This is the only way we can realistically make it in time.
          <br>
          I can confirm that they are all eligible for <a href="https://sponsors.hexstreamsoft.com/about/#perks" target="_blank">Advanced Perks</a>, including <a href="https://sponsors.hexstreamsoft.com/about/#lifetime-perks" target="_blank">Lifetime Perks</a>.

          Please make sure to <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">sponsor me</a> from an account able to give out doublers, you should see a banner confirming this at the top (when logged in).
          <br>
          Also <strong>beware of prorating</strong>, which might significantly cut down your contribution if you are not careful. Any prorating will be announced on the checkout page, and you may need to sponsor at a higher tier to arrive at the amount that you intended to contribute.

        <p>Dear LispWorks, Dear Usha, Dear Franz, Dear Jans,</p>

        <p>
          One of the biggest divisions within the Common Lisp community remains largely unacknowledged. That is <strong>the division between <em>Open Source and Proprietary</em></strong>.
          <br>
          There is tremendous untapped, latent energy to unlock to help make Common Lisp successful, and we just need a slight paradigm shift to do so.
        </p>

        <p>
          <a href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1213964177657794577" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">We can make Common Lisp a top 5 programming language by 2040</a>, and this will be much easier to achieve if we unify our forces.
          <br>
          <strong><a href="https://cv.hexstream.expert/" target="_blank">Through my work</a>, I am working to dramatically expand the Common Lisp community, which is guaranteed to greatly benefit your business</strong>.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>You could boost my productivity almost beyond imagination just by providing me a tiny fraction of a normal salary!</strong>
          <br>
          For instance, 1000$/month would be basically infinite money in my current situation. How about you each contribute 500$/month for 6 months as a trial?
          <br>
          Of course, please consider starting with a large donation to the <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">Common Lisp Revival 2020 Fundraiser</a> before <strong>10 december 2020</strong>, as GitHub will double your contribution!
        </p>

        <p>
          I also urge you to open source more of your technology, not even necessarily out of pure generosity, but simply because it makes so much business sense!
          <br>
          For instance, you could send SHOCKWAVES throughout the world simply by open sourcing <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/products/capi.html" target="_blank">CAPI</a> and <a href="https://allegrograph.com/products/allegrograph/" target="_blank">AllegroGraph</a>!
          <br>
          Inherently, the more you open source, the more you stand to benefit from the great Open Source Marketing Machine!
        </p>

        <p>In fact, I almost wonder if you should also open source LispWorks and Allegro Common Lisp and transform yourself into a services company like Red Hat? It's really hard to compete with world-class open source implementations like <a href="http://sbcl.org/" target="_blank">SBCL</a> these days. But obviously, this would be a more long-term project, and I don't presume to understand your business better than you do or tell you what to do. I'm just suggesting ideas. We stand to greatly benefit from a healthy exchange of ideas.</p>

        <p>

        <p>Dear Common Lisp Foundation, Dear Dave,</p>

        <p>Thank you for giving birth to <a href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1041671580957466624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">one of the most important conversations in the Common Lisp community</a>!</p>

        <p>I have reason to believe that your understanding and appreciation for <a href="https://cv.hexstream.expert/" target="_blank">my crucial work within the Common Lisp community</a> has only been growing since this historic event.</p>

        <p>I believe you have the necessary knowledge and resources to be a key ally in <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">leading Common Lisp to unprecedented success</a>.</p>

        <p>Dear Paul Graham, Dear Y Combinator,</p>

        <p><a href="https://cv.hexstream.expert/" target="_blank">I have been almost entirely dedicating my life to Common Lisp since mid-2006</a> when I discovered Common Lisp, largely thanks to <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/" target="_blank">your essays</a>, especially <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html" target="_blank">Beating the Averages</a>. After spending 2 weeks reading your essays and researching Common Lisp, I went all-in on Common Lisp and completely abandoned Java. <strong>To this day, this has been the best and most determinant event in my life and I am deeply thanking you for it!</strong></p>

        <p>Basically, I've been running <a href="https://www.hexstreamsoft.com/" target="_blank">an unregistered Common Lisp startup</a> for 14 years. I am planning to register in 2022 at the latest. I have finally started experiencing <a href="https://cv.hexstream.expert/#hexstreamsoft-alexa-stats" target="_blank">some visible success</a> this year, as I am finally reaching the interesting point in the exponential curve. <strong>I am requesting your help to further accelerate and embolden this process.</strong></p>

        <p>
          Unfortunately, I believe the traditional Y Combinator process would not be a good fit for me, due to various reasons.
          <br>
          I am requesting a fairly insignificant amount of funding compared to your usual investments, but this would completely change my life.
        </p>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">I am the chief architect of the looming Common Lisp revolution.</a> The revolution would still happen even if you just decided to watch it unfold from afar, but I thought I would highlight your opportunity to lend it a bit of your vast resources and influence, thereby greatly empowering it. Everyone has much to gain from this happening. This is a traditional win-win-win scenario.</p>

        <p>I trust that your world-class expertise in startups will easily detect the amazing intrinsic value and potential of me and my startup.</p>

        <p>Dear Ergodox/ZSA, Dear Erez, Dear Tisha, Dear Florian,</p>

        <p>The <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> is truly revolutionary and life-changing! I predict that it (or its close descendants) will remain the best keyboard on the planet for decades to come!</p>

        <p>Thank you for implementing custom labels in <a href="https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/planck-ez/layouts/ABWNG/latest/0" target="_blank">Oryx</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1237462417577295873" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">as I requested</a>. Your email support is truly amazing, and I was surprised to find that indeed, we have already exchanged <strong>more than 100 emails in 9 months!</strong> I greatly value our great relationship, and here is a perfect occasion to go to the next level!</p>

        <p>
          The <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> is so damn great that I couldn't resist making <a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/hardware/planck-ez/#my-config" target="_blank">an advanced presentation for my custom keyboard layout</a>.
          <br>
          You were so impressed with it that you quickly offered to <a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/articles/planck-ez-interview/" target="_blank">interview me</a>, and I then proceeded to really pour my soul into that article, with quite impressive results I might say!</p>

        <p>
          The kicker? <strong>I did this while I was already late to launch <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">the Common Lisp Revival 2020 Fundraiser</a>! <em>Oh noes!!</em></strong> 🤣
          <br>
          But seriously, I just <em>couldn't wait</em> to share my passion for the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> with the world! That's how goddamn amazing it is!!
        </p>

        <p>I had already been using the TypeMatrix 2030 (a somewhat similar keyboard) for more than a decade, and the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> is at least 20x better! It's easy to infer that I'm probably going to stick to the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> or a close descendant for the next decade at least... As <a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/articles/planck-ez-interview/#alternative-to-qmk" target="_blank">previously stated</a>, I am planning to build much more powerful alternatives to <a href="https://qmk.fm/" target="_blank">QMK</a>, <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/wally" target="_blank">Wally</a> and <a href="https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/" target="_blank">Oryx</a>, all written in Common Lisp, of course. Admittedly, it would take at least a few years before I can start working on this, due to <a href="https://roadmap.hexstreamsoft.com/" target="_blank">more pressing priorities</a>. My <a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/hardware/planck-ez/#my-config" target="_blank">awesome Planck EZ layout presentation</a> is already a good first step towards an Oryx alternative, although it is not yet written in Common Lisp. (I would probably only support the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a>, since that's the only keyboard I find interesting...) <strong><a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/articles/planck-ez-interview/#stenography" target="_blank">I believe the Planck EZ will be the key to unlocking 100x productivity!</a></strong></p>

        <p>
          I think there is already an inherent and fundamental link between Common Lisp and the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a>:
          <br>
          <em>It's only fair to expect that the best programmers would gravitate not only towards the best programming language, but also the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">best keyboard</a>!</em>
          <br>
          Thankfully, we have a tremendous opportunity to make that connection even more concrete today!
        </p>

        <p><strong>As such, I would be extremely honored if you made a large donation to <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">the Common Lisp Revival 2020 Fundraiser</a> <em>before 10 december 2020</em> to help kickstart the Common Lisp revolution right now!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>
Naval Ravikant, founder of AngelList, describes his companyâ€™s shipping culture in one of his <a href="https://nav.al/build-a-team-that-ships">blog posts</a>. 
</p>
<p>
They like to keep projects to one person. And every person is responsible for shipping something every single week. 
</p>
<p>
Itâ€™s quite a polarizing culture. So much so that Naval makes explicit that their environment is wrong for most people. Theyâ€™re looking for independent people who can ship code and if you donâ€™t fit that type, you should go look elsewhere:
</p>


<blockquote>
    If they canâ€™t ship, release them. Our environment is wrong for them. They should go find someplace where they can thrive. Thereâ€™s someplace for everyone.
    <span>Naval Ravikant</span>
</blockquote>

<p>
I wish more companies would do this. When youâ€™re able to clearly outline your values, you tend to attract individuals that stick. 
</p>
<p>
And sometimes, itâ€™s just as important to list all the reasons why someone <em>wouldnâ€™t enjoy</em> working at a company as it is to list everything good about the company. 
</p>
<p>
Hereâ€™s an example from <a href="https://www.notion.so/Join-Levels-Remote-Head-of-Marketing-Growth-6e64dba240404eaea9160a48f1c5f24f">Levels Healthâ€™s</a> recent job description:
</p>

<center>
    <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_angellist/job_description.png" alt="">
</center>

<p>
Information like this is gold dust. Think about the countless <em>years</em> people waste working at companies that theyâ€™re not suited for. 
</p>
<p>
For instance, the role above would be a bad fit for me. Iâ€™m at a stage of my career where mentorship would be helpful and Iâ€™d like to execute on projects that are clearly defined in scope. 
</p>
<p>
If a company is not able to explain to me what would make someone a bad candidate for the role, then that would worry me. If youâ€™re not able to eliminate <em>anyone</em> for a role, then the job position itself has likely not been set up for success. 
</p>
<h2>Build a team that ships</h2>


<p>
I want to talk a bit more about AngelListâ€™s prolific shipping culture.
</p>
<p>
It reminds me of a ceramics experiment that was done (can be traced back to this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0961454733/?tag=codihorr-20">book</a>) in which the teacher divided the class into two groups. 
</p>
<p>
One group would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, whilst the other solely on its quality.
</p>
<p>
The grading procedure was simple:
</p>
<p>
<em>â€œOn the final day of class, the instructor would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the "quantity" group: fifty pound of pots rated an "A", forty pounds a "B", and so on. Those being graded on "quality", however, needed to produce only one pot - albeit a perfect one - to get an "A".â€�</em>
</p>
<p>
Fast forward to grading time. Can you guess what happened? 
</p>
<p>
It turns out that the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity:
</p>
<p>
<em>â€œIt seems that while the "quantity" group was busily churning out piles of work - and learning from their mistakes - the "quality" group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.â€�</em>
</p>
<p>
Naval acknowledges that shipping at the velocity they do is not ideal. They make mistakes and many of the features they release are half-baked. 
</p>
<p>
But it is also precisely <em>because</em> they ship so much that theyâ€™re able to get it right. Just like the â€œquantityâ€� group, the engineers at AngelList are constantly iterating and testing out their assumptions. 
</p>
<p>
Rather than always being in paralysis mode, they just build the damn thing. And if it doesnâ€™t work, they try again until it does. 
</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In September 2020, Brown University <a href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/2020/09/28/remote-students-receive-emails-brown-accusing-violating-code-student-conduct">accused students</a> of lying about their location; e.g.:</p>
<p><img src="https://jack.wrenn.fyi/blog/brown-location-surveillance/notice.png" height="auto" width="100%" alt="The University has learned that between September 14, 2020 and September 21, 2020 you were allegedly in the Providence area during which time your location of study was listed as remote. This alleged behavior is a violation of the Student Code of Conduct and the COVID-19 Campus Safety Policy. A copy of the Student Commitment to COVID-19 Community Health and Safety Requirements is attached for your review, along with this link to the COVID-19 Campus Safety Policy. failure to abide by these requirements is a violation of the Code of Student Conduct. 
Based on the details of the incident and your student conduct history, the Office of Student Conduct &amp; Community Standards has decided to allow you the opportunity to accept responsibility for the following prohibited conduct without having a COVID-19 Dean's Review Meeting:
• D.8 Failure to Comply
• D.13 Misrepresentation
"></p>
<p><strong>What was Brown's basis for these accusations?</strong></p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/2020/09/28/remote-students-receive-emails-brown-accusing-violating-code-student-conduct">interview with The Brown Daily Herald</a>, University Spokesperson Brian Clark said the University evaluated a variety of indicators, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>indications of building access,</li>
<li>indications of accessing private electronic services,</li>
<li>indications of accessing secure networks, and</li>
<li>reports from community members.</li>
</ol>
<p>The mechanics of that last indicator are pretty self-explanatory, but what about the others? <a href="https://it.brown.edu/services/type/canvas-learning-management-system">Canvas</a> <em>doesn't</em> <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/google-wants-to-know-your-location">Want To Know Your Location</a>. <strong>In this post, I'm going to break down the technical mechanisms behind each of these indicators.</strong></p>
<p>For the most part, I do not have insider knowledge on how Brown reached its decisions. Rather, I'm going to consider each of the indicators Brian Clark named, and describe the technical mechanisms to which Brown <em>could</em> have availed itself to generating location data.</p>
<h2 id="indications-of-building-access">Indications of Building Access</h2>
<p>This is an easy one. Brown's buildings are located on Brown's campus. Brown's campus is in Providence. If you are in Brown's buildings, you are on Brown's campus, in Providence. QED.</p>
<p>At Brown, building access is primarily regulated with electronic control systems (namely Software House's <a href="https://www.swhouse.com/products/software_CCURE9000.aspx"><strong>C•CURE 9000</strong></a> system), not mechanical keys.</p>
<p>Encoded on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_stripe_card#Track_2">track 2</a> of the magnetic stripe on every University ID card is a sixteen digit number that uniquely identifies the card:</p>
<p><img src="https://jack.wrenn.fyi/blog/brown-location-surveillance/brown-id-card-back.jpg" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Image of back of Brown ID card. A tall magnetic stripe runs across the entire width of the card."></p>
<p>Well, that's underwhelming — of <em>course</em> you can't <em>see</em> it! However, up until 2017 or 2018, this number was also <em>printed</em> on the front of ID cards, just above the card-holder's name:</p>
<p><img src="https://jack.wrenn.fyi/blog/brown-location-surveillance/brown-id-card-front.jpg" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Image fo the front of a Brown ID card, displaying the building access code: 6009553660926201"></p>
<p>This pseudo-random identifier (well, its last ten digits) are what uniquely identify you whenever you swipe your Brown ID card <em>anywhere</em>. And, if you lose your Brown ID card, this is the <em>only</em> thing that's changed when you're issued a replacement. Convenient! In contrast, when you lose your dorm room's mechanical key, Brown must replace (or rather, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rekeying">rekey</a>) the locks.</p>
<p>But, <em>also</em> unlike a mechanical key, <em>every</em> swipe of a Brown ID card is logged in a central database. <strong>The C•CURE 9000 lets administrators view the complete historical building access history of a person.</strong> Last Spring, Brown used this mechanism to identify and prod students who were slow to evacuate Providence.</p>
<h2 id="indicators-from-electronic-services">Indicators from Electronic Services</h2>
<p>University web services like Canvas <em>don't</em> directly ask you for your location. Nonetheless, accessing these services leaves a location finger print: your IP address.</p>
<p>Your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address">IP address</a> is a number that identifies your device (computer, phone, etc.) for the purposes of network routing. In principle, nobody but you and your internet provider know the <em>exact</em> mapping of your IP address to your physical address.</p>
<p>In practice, IP addresses can be used to <em>roughly</em> geolocate a device. Batches of IP addresses are associated <em>loosely</em> with geographic areas. Since every web service access leaves an IP address as a trace, there are tremendous incentives for advertisers to be able accurately identify what city or town an IP address is probably associated with.</p>
<p>Brown probably <em>isn't</em> analyzing the access logs of its <em>individual</em> web services (like Canvas). Rather, they need only to audit the access logs of its three identity access management (IAM) systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://workspace.google.com/">Google Workplace</a> IAM system is used to control access to your @brown.edu email, and to the various Google Drive services. <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/4580120?hl=en"><strong>Google Workplace</strong> provides administrators with login audit logs that include users' IP addresses.</a></li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.shibboleth.net/">Shibboleth</a> IAM system controls access to all <em>other</em> Brown web services, such as Canvas. It's what you think of as your "Brown account". Shibboleth is <em>very</em> flexible, and can be <a href="https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/IDP30/AuditLoggingConfiguration#AuditLoggingConfiguration-GenericFields">configured to log IP addresses</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://duo.com/">DUO</a> is used to provide two-factor authentication for Shibboleth logins. <a href="https://help.duo.com/s/article/1023?language=en_US#docs-internal-guid-0aa3b4ce-c686-7559-8814-1377592fce4a:%7E:text=Access%20Device">It too provides administrators with detailed access logs</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can partly view your Google Workplace login history for yourself by opening your Brown email and clicking "Details" in the bottom right-hand corner of the page; e.g.:</p>
<p><img src="https://jack.wrenn.fyi/blog/brown-location-surveillance/gmail-account-activity.png" height="auto" width="100%"></p>
<p>With <em>either</em> of these access logs in hand, Brown could then turn to any number of geolocation services (<a href="https://tools.keycdn.com/geo">like this one</a>) to guess your physical location.</p>
<h2 id="indicators-from-secure-networks">Indicators from Secure Networks</h2>
<p>This is another easy one. Brown's WiFI network <a href="https://jack.wrenn.fyi/blog/blog/brown-location-surveillance/Campus_Wireless_Coverage_Map_24x36_1.pdf">blankets Brown's campus</a>. Brown's campus is in Providence. If you are on Brown's WiFi network, you are on Brown's campus. QED.</p>
<p>What might surprise you is the sheer depth of surveillance that's capable with WiFi alone. This section will <em>barely</em> scratch the surface.</p>
<h3 id="identification">Identification</h3>
<p>Brown's WiFi routers each broadcast three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_set_(802.11_network)">service sets</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://it.brown.edu/services/type/wireless-network-brown">Brown</a></li>
<li><a href="https://it.brown.edu/services/type/wireless-network-eduroam">eduroam</a></li>
<li><a href="https://it.brown.edu/services/type/wireless-access-brown-guest">Brown Guest</a></li>
</ol>
<p>The Brown and eduroam networks require that you authenticate with your Brown account credentials. Brown University is thus able to identify the owner of any device connected to these networks.</p>
<p>While Brown Guest does <em>not</em> require authentication, it still provides mechanisms of identification. Your network devices broadcast a unique identifier called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address"><strong>MAC address</strong></a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://drawings.jvns.ca/mac-address/"><img type="image/svg+xml" src="https://drawings.jvns.ca/drawings/mac-address.svg" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Comic by Julia Evans. Text: Every computer on the internet has a network card. When you make HTTP requests with Ethernet/WiFi, every packet gets sent to a MAC address. (&quot;Wait, how do I know someone else on the same network isn't reading all my packets?&quot; &quot;You don't! That's one reason we use HTTPS &amp; secure WiFi networks.&quot;) Your router has a table that maps IP addresses to MAC addresses.  (Read about ARP for more.)
"></a></p>
<p>Brown <a href="https://it.brown.edu/computing-policies/network-connection-policy#32:%7E:text=CIS%20maintains%20a%20database%20of%20unique,a%20computer%20when%20it%20is%20necessary.">maintains databases of the MAC addresses of all connected devices</a>.</p>
<p>If you have ever connected to an authenticated network, Brown will be able to de-anonymize your connections to Brown Guest — <em>unless</em> your device implements <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address#Randomization">MAC address randomization</a>, which (as the name suggests) randomizes your device's MAC address on a per-network basis.</p>
<h3 id="localization">Localization</h3>
<p>Brown's access points log the MAC addresses of the devices that have connected to them. As of 2015, Brown retained these logs for at least several years — possibly indefinitely. Since there are so many access points on campus, which access point you are connected to can narrow your location down to a particular room. <strong>Combined, these logs paint a <em>very</em> accurate picture of your location on campus at any time.</strong></p>
<p>You do not need to be <em>actively</em> browsing the internet for Brown to know where you are via this mechanism. As you walk through campus, your phone likely <em>automatically</em> reconnects to the nearest available access point. If you are within a literal stone's throw of campus, you should assume that Brown can (roughly) identify your location.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you are in range of three or more of Brown's ARUBA access points, Brown can, in principle, precisely triangulate your location. This functionality is <a href="https://www.arubanetworks.com/pdf/technology/whitepapers/wp_Hybrid_WIDS.pdf">common</a> in enterprise-grade WiFi infrastructure. (If you've ever tried to run a "rogue" WiFi router in your dorm room and receive an angry knock on your door — this is the mechanism by which you were located.)</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Educational_Rights_and_Privacy_Act"><em>Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act</em></a> empowers students to request their education records from their University.</p>

<p>If you are a current Brown student and would like to go beyond my blog post and learn <em>exactly</em> how Brown University knows your location, <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/registrar/student-information-rightsferpa">file a FERPA request</a>. Brown University is obligated to respond within 45 days. You'll need to be specific with your request. I suggest requesting:</p>
<ul>
<li>the timestamps, MAC addresses and BSSIDs associated with your devices' connections to Brown University's wireless access points</li>
<li>the timestamps and locations associated with all building accesses conducted with your ID card</li>
<li>the login audit data associated with all Google Workplace, Shibboleth, and DUO authentications conducted by your accounts</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation"><em>General Data Protection Regulation</em></a> gives EU citizens and residents expansive control over how their personally identifiable information (PII) is used, and the right to request a copy of or the destruction of collected data. I believe these requests should be directed to <a href="https://compliance.brown.edu/">Brown's compliance office</a>. You might be able to do this even if you're a Brown alumni.</p>
<p><strong>If you attempt either of these steps, <a href="mailto:jack@wrenn.fyi">please get in touch</a>!</strong> I'm very curious as to what Brown is <em>actually</em> doing.</p>
<h2 id="bonus-surveillance-cameras">Bonus: Surveillance Cameras</h2>
<p>As of February 2020, <a href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/2020/02/21/cameras-installed-hegeman-hall/#post-2838338:%7E:text=The%20University%20uses%20approximately%20800%20cameras,with%20high%20crime%20activity%2C%20Porter%20said."><em>eight hundred</em> surveillance cameras monitor campus 24/7</a>. Brown has as about as many surveillance cameras as it has full-time faculty! This map documents a <em>mere seven percent</em> of Brown University's total camera surveillance capacity:</p>

<p><small>This map displays data from <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/about">OpenStreetMap</a>. <a href="https://pietervdvn.github.io/Staging/surveillance.html?z=17&amp;lat=41.82681&amp;lon=-71.4016">Help improve its accuracy!</a></small></p><p>Brown University has a longstanding policy governing the appropriate uses of its surveillance cameras. <strong>Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/2008/01/10/surveillance-cameras-on-campus-triple/#post-1679525:%7E:text=DPS%20would%20not%20release%20the%20University%E2%80%99s%20full%20policy%20on%20the%20surveillance%20camera%20system">this policy is secret</a>.</strong></p>
<p>While Brown probably does not <em>currently</em> have the capacity to both broadly and deeply inspect the firehose of data produced by these cameras, expect this to change in the near future. Axis Communications, Brown's primary supplier of surveillance cameras, <a href="https://www.axis.com/customer-story/3767">now touts cameras that can perform <em>on-board</em> facial recognition</a>. And Software House, the provider of the C•CURE 9000 access control system, has begun marketing the integration of facial recognition with its access control systems:</p>

<p>PostgreSQL, or Postgres for short, comes with many out-of-the-box features that make it very popular among developers and data engineers. Among the numerous benefits of implementing Postgres are that there are many approaches to take to scale your database horizontally or vertically—but that is a discussion for a whole different article. Postgres comes with plenty of add-ons and a strong community of developers behind it too for open-source support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Aside from plugins that you can quickly add a variety of tools and resources to your Postgres suite to expand the many functionalities of your Postgres database system to help you take your use of Postgres to the next level. This article shares the top 62 tools, plugins, and add-ons in that suite for you to improve your Postgres operations and productivity quickly and efficiently.</p>



<h2><strong>Graphical User Interface</strong></h2>



<p>Postgres doesn’t come with a native GUI, but that doesn’t mean you cannot manage your Postgres databases using a simple user interface. Web-based GUIs and tools for this specific purpose are easy to find.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/plt54JgoE56tK9XTfy0n77S5kbUU3yOsxHuFncLuPYsC32QWHl9NQUTVulFjqJupJRB5i-Uvwy3u9NF0liPb4C2BCrEjvxNcZfSaUe2kJtPap4fiC3INTgPJubPtRHRhwi3zFGTl" alt="#DataGrip" width="254" height="113"></figure>



<ol><li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Datagrip</a></li></ol>



<p>DataGrip is a tool that helps simplify managing multiple databases. It is compatible with multiple database systems, including PostgreSQL. You get a graphical interface for managing databases, running queries, and completing routine maintenance tasks. This tool is very popular at Cherre.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/D0s1cOPz_g7XyuUoASoiIubUy5ZC5w3F5dSNp9KGUWF1alKUJCH-DzzBdO0yK_fgvUmG9_L1K59jYcq3OWfgrICkU6ov5uV9ukGNZQycHZvllxvtMZLYI_QfQEj1rroavXbnLVeb" alt="#DBeaver" width="216" height="108"></figure>



<ol start="2"><li><a href="https://dbeaver.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DBeaver&nbsp;</a></li></ol>



<p>The latest version of DBeaver, 7.1.4, includes data editing features that are designed to be intuitive. DBeaver, however, offers more than data editing. It supports PostgreSQL and many other database systems.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/EIl8uFSl3bnrnLWOE5xbNYy_PLs0Gb1g5xC3CuhqGN_6Snr8DmyO0NI7BDxhRuKqqreLGm4hPwMTfA970hSC--k1D3UKg_xsNYk6qgnX5bTM9HFDX5IlPQhLTXC98UN3eEzLWuJu" alt="#Navicat" width="267" height="108"></figure>



<ol start="3"><li><a href="https://www.navicat.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Navicat for PostgreSQL</a></li></ol>



<p>Navicat is not a new name in the database landscape. Its product for Postgres is designed to offer you all the tools you need to manage complex databases. There are also data visualization tools available within.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/FQ2Tdygv9EVAvWLrJo8Ab9jA-L1cBtv3ek41rVaaVmCKLfYyHpJewvoy6dlmIiuNaLFODhsDHFdMfeotCx9cmcoBzxLFbpAN_efDh5s13Qzn2xFSXFfQkAmqlucDgfMf4wPhxzT6" alt="#Pgadmin" width="113" height="117"></figure>



<ol start="4"><li><a href="https://www.pgadmin.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pgadmin</a></li></ol>



<p>When it comes to keeping Postgres maintenance and management simple, Postgres has pgADmin. The web-based option now supports external configuration files and runs completely in the cloud. You can use it as a way to manage database clusters. However, it feels a little limited compared to a full gui.</p>



<ol start="5"><li><a href="https://www.valentina-db.com/en/studio-for-postgresql" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Valentina Studio for PostgreSQL</a></li></ol>



<p>Valentina Studio comes in different flavors, but even the free version is capable enough for managing multiple Postgres databases. It supports forms, can be integrated with CI/CD pipelines, and simplifies data transfer between databases.</p>



<ol start="6"><li><a href="http://phppgadmin.sourceforge.net/doku.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">phpPgAdmin</a></li></ol>



<p>MySQL has phpMyAdmin, and PostgreSQL has phpPgAdmin. If you are familiar with phpMyAdmin, then you will have no trouble using the Postgres version. The features and tools are relatively the same with a few adjustments.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/FHiWWzHKdvKOGEwdNi_FFJ4cmSFLW208aREpKrHw-fdNhR0AnIx7N5Rpe5_wVhnVpbGYfrF3dZJFVSjdse4ye7fXvVna-WxaW8oP94ZPEwl6VH5mOYfTCfoo12EQOp5mq8FgAc8A" alt="#Metabase" width="195" height="146"></figure>



<ol start="7"><li><a href="https://www.metabase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metabase</a></li></ol>



<p>Metabase is more of a data processing tool with advanced UIs. Rather than complex queries, it allows you to answer questions by visualizing insights collected from the PostgreSQL databases that you maintain.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Z1m1CLoiqrVOz1S1LHm1SJDB5RkgizMFx8mqRC-GWyMs7gfrhAMoCHwOe9yGqKGJpWYPxJM62NgdJVAKJy6NwbYcszplUaCl0o1SOs68VgNsjFIc_sljbRRimFGeJPIodS_Zqn3_" alt="#Slemma" width="240" height="80"></figure>



<ol start="8"><li><a href="https://slemma.com/connectors/database-reporting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Slemma</a></li></ol>



<p>Slemma is far from just another GUI for Postgres. It takes data visualization to another level by introducing automation. Reports from a series of entries can be generated automatically based on parameters and the kind of insights you want to get in return.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/vDAmrWbVqi9izoCkHpRiHKd7KC8sbos8p_L7tgBOLz-2EuI12hFg1BuhY9vgDfdyUGd__ChCmc37rpimb4LMqXPYnzLP7RHDqnU6_5PWA_B4UK5SZu6lEHxfZAwqSKcNxrGZF7CP" alt="#windwardstudios" width="331" height="76"></figure>



<ol start="9"><li><a href="https://www.windwardstudios.com/datasource/postgresql" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Windward Studios</a></li></ol>



<p>Windward is the last GUI tool on our list with a special trick up its sleeve: it can be integrated with Microsoft Office natively. You can use Office apps to design templates for reports or to visualize your report using data stored in Postgres.</p>



<h2><strong>Utilities</strong></h2>



<p>Utilities for Postgres are usually designed to do specific things. While PostgreSQL doesn’t require special maintenance, it is still a good idea to integrate good utilities into your database management workflow. The best utilities tools will certainly make your life as a database engineer easier.</p>



<ol><li><a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/pg_catcheck" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pg_catcheck</a></li></ol>



<p>System catalog corruption can be a huge problem that can bring an entire Postgres database down when it happens. Depending on the severity of the corruption, you may also lose entries and valuable information. Use pg_catheck to monitor for system catalog corruption.</p>



<ol start="2"><li><a href="http://www.pgbouncer.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pgBouncer</a></li></ol>



<p>As the name suggests, pgBouncer acts as the bouncer that prevents unauthorized access. The common use case for this tool is to manage connections, similar to a load balancer. While Postgres is relatively secure as long as you follow the best practices, having encrypted SCRAM secrets used for storing passwords is a good idea.</p>



<ol start="3"><li><a href="https://hypopg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HypoPG</a></li></ol>



<p>Hypotheticals are not always possible—and are certainly difficult to keep track of—and HypoPG is here to solve those challenges. It is basically a virtual index that doesn’t really consume cloud resources. It can also handle hypothetical partitioning.</p>



<ol start="4"><li><a href="https://www.postgis.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PostGIS</a></li></ol>



<p>PostGIS fills one specific hole, lack of native support for spatial information. Postgres users can now use PostGIS to use location information in queries. If your app relies on location data, this utility certainly helps.</p>



<ol start="5"><li><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/postgres-fdw.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Postgres_fdw</a></li></ol>



<p>Foreign-data wrapper makes accessing external Postgres databases possible. Postgres_fdw takes that idea one step further and makes the whole process easier.&nbsp; In short you can use objects from other databases, without having to sync the two together, Postgres_fdw inexpensively makes it look like it’s in both. After installing the utility, you can create a foreign server object and work with user mapping accordingly.</p>



<ol start="6"><li><a href="https://www.yohz.com/dbdoc_details.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DB Doc for PostgreSQL</a></li></ol>



<p>While launching a new app or distributing it to a client is a fairly straightforward process, making sure that the app is used properly—and is developed with care—is still difficult. DB Doc for PostgreSQL takes care of creating documentation for your projects.</p>



<h2><strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</strong></h2>



<p>Being able to utilize Postgres without having to manage the entire cloud infrastructure supporting it is something that many development teams want these days. Organizations turn to managed database services so that they can utilize the features of Postgres without the usual complications. Fortunately, there are several solutions being offered as Platform as a Service or PaaS.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/gxEUzL5xD9FYbEf-O1dSweSDqCeuqH29GAw6U5GyrdwRC_SO5VV4V9XPG3JysT_7F9kcsa-iE0r265pi6RwU5uzXM-tpSnsRHqLHsKTX7VlyNJC4Vx1grypmnH3oFvmQwyzQo2nW" alt="#AmazonRDSforPostgreSQL" width="118" height="132"></figure>



<ol><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL</a></li></ol>



<p>Amazon’s RDS is perhaps the most popular option of them all, offering cloud relational databases as managed services. It has Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL, which allows you to forget about storage, deployment cycles, availability, and backup while taking full advantage of what Postgres has to offer.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/nS9uoXzAn68iKWqAXzTgHzMuvjQHn1hmVqNshUIYCWstM0cHCt6EbVAdiormaASkc-li1fJ1JWz71885r6tTmODgpyRt6J_gYBjbT1W3jaQwoOjMMg7HPYBOBYhqb5UfvyS8QJro" alt="#aiven" width="173" height="91"></figure>



<ol start="2"><li><a href="https://aiven.io/postgresql" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aiven for PostgreSQL</a></li></ol>



<p>Aiven for PostgreSQL is another option when it comes to fully managed SQL databases. You can give the platform a try for free before switching to one of the paid plans that suit your needs best. Even better, Aiven runs on AWS, GCP, Azure, and other cloud ecosystems for better availability.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/iIeJzX5JFZAPYm24YDmJo3HzHIUgSfrhyGhrm15jrIPLNWot_qIWi3UDmEf7_2l2fn4Pxa2TsGECybWOVjqhOPiuRlNSyXiURZjhJT_Z9TAMg8bPSNEwyCrey_1jpPUCby_w8bAE" alt="#CloudSQLforPostgreSQL" width="137" height="128"></figure>



<ol start="3"><li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL</a></li></ol>



<p>Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL is Google’s version of managed relational databases in the cloud. As part of Google Cloud, Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL integrates well with other GCP services, plus it can be used to support apps running in a multi-cloud environment thanks to its comprehensive API.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/7ZleaQxKb5wx4XkzKSr7GNtUS2UEch28DRlFutxf3iS4Ai5-0qsFIv-M8oImaGQwLIKoWDxychrTKrgQebP-30aEA_AMuHy_prL3botCzH5qX5F9IrCTu0F2dvxaqY6olaoRk3Ww" alt="#AzureDatabaseforPostgrSQL" width="143" height="143"></figure>



<ol start="4"><li><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/postgresql/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Azure Database for PostgreSQL</a></li></ol>



<p>Amazon has one. Google has one. So it is not surprising to see Microsoft offering the Azure Database for PostgreSQL. Azure doesn’t just offer another PaaS for Postgres users, though. It leans heavily on scalability and offers intelligent performance recommendations—powered by machine learning—as one of its features.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/oEUtjqnAJ03bOJYbQwkiRuvcTTNe2Rd0hXx90YTR4ksZy60WEsiOeoAqZh6soY89yz2ifXnSwyryIuNfQSc_Ytrbo-7JeXi4Qs1wjdM3m20Ir-MtgmsHbU8baiND5WBHxTDHQ95s" alt="#DigitalOcean" width="132" height="132"></figure>



<ol start="5"><li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DigitalOcean Managed Databases</a></li></ol>



<p>For a more affordable option, DigitalOcean Managed Databases is the service you want to look into. It starts at only $15/month, but It offers easy setup, seamless maintenance, daily backups, and multiple redundancies to support your apps and microservices.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/E59LDZy3uUEiBAnPPFauhfT3q6tyvzWyWtrC0xKGyp_pbVurrhrCDo4ZQW2eTvVX03fdD8MsegQvb0VlaobAgX5R_pY60qItNr8b9ZweovwCHE-2wZNeKnvohMiXKmDLZ9yitemq" alt="#Heroku" width="198" height="110"></figure>



<ol start="6"><li><a href="https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-postgresql" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Heroku PostgreSQL</a></li></ol>



<p>Heroku PostgreSQL offers all the Postgres features you will ever need, but without making the entire platform cluttered or too complicated. Available in the United States and Europe, Heroku PostgreSQL is also affordable thanks to its nano and micro plans.</p>



<h2><strong>Applications</strong></h2>



<p>There are a lot of tools designed to make designing Postgres databases, creating relationships, managing tables, and organizing the entire PostgreSQL platform easier, but most of them are designed to offer specific features. In this part, we are going to take a look at the two Postgres applications that you can use for end-to-end database design and management.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/BNG9GB5GDj0UgmVKyLRJ2PFYbJBXPHemZTxuUfYYy3_WrsOTDydLH4eORC3gQwSQ6Bu38EGkcxzKd6N6yJ4emc88wRIhz9rQIZ-U6FrdXtxxRF21JdT2Toj9_vOWosaLeyTDG-ZA" alt="#agileBase" width="129" height="115"></figure>



<ol><li><a href="http://www.agilebase.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">agileBase</a></li></ol>



<p>AgileBase is famous for its low-code or no-code approach. You don’t have to be a database specialist—or any specialist for that matter—to build your own platform and support the application you want to deliver. AgileBase’s PostgreSQL features are designed as blocks and can be customized to your liking.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/4COODpGprHglQA440b4to0ipwxVG3SIqAZJNOyqHQ_aERyOUZENL9c6nFzn5ue05rXnVomRuQRV9pkeF_m9T6l8cX9vZ2ojPzYanMVYL2HJgjWgDa3ZfrRrFk2AXoCqmXb28SKF-" alt="#Dataedo" width="255" height="78"></figure>



<ol start="2"><li><a href="https://dataedo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dataedo</a></li></ol>



<p>Dataedo is all about simplicity. You can manage even the most complex Postgres database through the app’s simple user interface. Even relationships are displayed visually and can be edited as such. This is a great app to use if you don’t want complex database management to be a bottleneck in your pipeline.</p>



<h2><strong>High-Availability</strong></h2>



<p>A database always sits at the core of the application that uses it. Database failures and unreliable database systems are unacceptable because they tend to bring the entire application down with them. That is why PostgreSQL is best implemented in a highly available environment, and these tools are the ones to use if you want to monitor high availability.</p>



<ol><li><a href="https://daamien.github.io/PostgreSQL-Dashboard/">B</a><a href="https://daamien.github.io/PostgreSQL-Dashboard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">G</a><a href="https://daamien.github.io/PostgreSQL-Dashboard/">R</a></li></ol>



<p>The PostgreSQL Dashboard offers access to key metrics that make ensuring high availability easier. There is no need to go through logs manually. Insights are displayed visually and you can go straight to refining your cloud infrastructure to boost the reliability of your database system.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/THt0_k5TJV7ZBN8Evk-T8SDq_RMjV9WLgxMAHzjkfxFDer19sBClE-GQDwPNUtSqg3lclTrPQC48D46J2e6f72b4xArlJOO-SSusLTmXdNZ6FznQcBq24UGq3RDxKsHuKoroWXPy" alt="#Stolon" width="210" height="105"></figure>



<ol start="2"><li><a href="https://github.com/sorintlab/stolon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stolon</a></li></ol>



<p>Stolon is another native PostgreSQL management tool designed to make high availability more accessible. It adds features such as native support for Kubernetes and automatic service discovery, allowing multiple database instances to run …</p></div></div>

<p>The PDF producer meta data for the annual report PDF has been set to "Linux kernel 0.12.1 for Workgroups" and the PDF creator meta data element to "Sharp Zaurus XR-5000 (Maemo5) Edition". Somebody thought to better hide the real data and had some tongue-in-cheek ideas. Kudos.</p>

<p>But nicer would have been to use Open Source software to produce the report, not?</p>

<p>Running <code>strings 2020-Linux-Foundation-Annual-Report_113020.pdf | grep Adobe | wc -l</code> gives us 1229 lines and confirms the suspicion of the toolchain.</p>

<p>A stale <code>/Title (Annual Report 2020) /Producer (macOS Version 10.15.7 \(Build 19H15\) Quartz PDFContext)</code> has been forgotten in the document to tell us about the platform.</p>

<p>So, ladies and gentlemen, the Linux Foundation 2020 annual report has been produced on a Mac.</p>

<p>Running Adobe Creative Cloud on MacOS Catalina 10.15.7.</p>

<p>Which is proprietary software. Its kernel (and some userland pieces) are based on BSD. Not Linux.</p>

<p>The image on the front page also struck me as a bit odd ... using a ballpoint pen on the laptop screen?</p>

<p>Unbranded laptop.
Unbranded cup in the foreground.</p>

<p>All of that cries stock image so loud it hurts.</p>

<p>Google currently finds ~560 uses of the picture and any <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/support/article/Do-I-need-to-credit-Shutterstock-the-artist-when-I-use-Images-or-Footage">editorial use</a> nicely tells us that it is © <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/de/g/draganagordic">Dragana Gordic / Shutterstock</a>.</p>

<p>The image is "Smiling mom working at home with her child on the sofa while writing an email. Young woman working from home, while in quarantine isolation during the Covid-19 health crisis".</p>

I hope, if her laptop had been powered on, it would have run Linux. I mean, what else would still run on an old white MacBook with an Intel "Core 2 Duo" processor from 2008?</p>

<h2 id="why-do-i-care-about-this">Why do I care about this</h2>

<p>Recently I solved <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/issues/396">this</a> delta issue,
where the maintainer asked to switch from Travis CI to GitHub actions.</p>

<p>These are all the pull requests I’ve done if you want to have a look at this journey:
<a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/399">#399</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/400">#400</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/409">#409</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/411">#411</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/413">#413</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/417">#417</a>
and finally <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/418">#418</a>.</p>

<p>And yes..As you can see I like small incremental work and early feedback instead of giant pull requests. 😁</p>

<p>Anyway, the delta project has a lot of compilation targets and the binaries are automatically released in the
GitHub releases <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/releases">page</a> every time the project is tagged. Sweet. 😌</p>

<p><img src="https://www.marcoieni.com/2020/12/rust-makes-cross-compilation-childs-play/delta.png" alt="delta releases" title="Releases"></p>

<p>From an x86_64 architecture (TLDR: common 64 bit Intel or AMD processors) it is really straightforward to
compile for a different operating system with <code>cargo</code> if you are targeting the same architecture.
For example if you want to compile for macOS you just need to run:</p>

<pre><code>rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin
cargo build --target x86_64-apple-darwin
</code></pre>

<p>The problems start to arise when you want to compile for a different architecture, such as i686 (32 bit) or ARM processors.
In this case, you have to install some dependencies and set some environment variables, which may be painful.
For example, in the old continuous integrations scripts of delta,
<a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/blob/15d06cbf7584570ec3b5beaba99cb8898f9ec3dc/etc/ci/before_install.sh">this</a>
was the way dependencies were installed. Ugly, I know. As rust developers we are used to great tools,
so there must be a better way right?</p>

<h2 id="meet-cross">Meet Cross</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>“Zero setup” cross compilation and “cross testing” of Rust crates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the description of the <a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross">Cross</a> tool.</p>

<p>The TLDR is that it let you compile and test rust projects for architectures other than i686 and x86_64.</p>

<p>Instead of doing <code>cargo build --target &lt;YOUR_TARGET&gt;</code> you simply do <code>cross build --target &lt;YOUR_TARGET&gt;</code>.
Based on the target, in fact, cross will run a docker image that has all the right dependencies already
installed and configured by the rust-embedded team itself. 😉
And that’s it..just run <code>cargo install cross</code> and you are ready to cross-compile for all
<a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross#supported-targets">these</a> targets in rust, no other dependency
is required, except docker of course!</p>

<p>Obviously this was not an exhaustive overview about cross and I encourage you to have a look at the GitHub page
if you are interested.</p>

<h2 id="cross-in-github-actions">Cross in GitHub actions</h2>

<p>Of course, after a whole morning getting mad trying to setup weird ubuntu dependencies for the delta issue,
when I found out about cross I felt very stupid for not knowing it in advance and I tried to integrate it in the
Continuous Deployment delta pipeline.</p>

<p>It turns out that this is like the easiest thing in the world! The <a href="https://github.com/actions-rs/cargo">action-rs/cargo</a> action
I was already using had built-in <a href="https://github.com/actions-rs/cargo#cross-compilation">support</a> for cross.
Now I even felt more stupid, but anyway..you just need to set the <code>use-cross</code> variable to <code>true</code> and you are done!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/blob/e198c0d841d9fb660e59e0329235a8601b407c69/.github/workflows/cd.yml#L32-L37">This</a>
is the step that builds the whole delta project for all its different targets..easy, right? 😀</p>

<h2 id="cross-in-rust-github-template">Cross in Rust GitHub template</h2>

<p>You may or (probably) may not be aware of <a href="https://rust-github.github.io/">Rust GitHub Template</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rust GitHub Template is a template for cargo generate that aims to be a starting point suitable for the vast majority of rust projects that will be hosted on GitHub.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Beyond all its nice goodies, this template will setup Continuous Deployment for you, therefore whenever
you tag your project, it will be published on <code>crates.io</code> and the binaries will be released in the GitHub Releases page,
just like in delta. 😁</p>

<p>Until today, Rust GitHub template only supported x86_64 windows, linux and mac, but after I found out Cross I couldn’t resist
and I added support for i686 and aarch64 linux architectures, which are both two <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html">tier 1</a> rust targets.
In practice, this means your “old thinkpad” and “raspberry pi” users will thank you a lot. 😛</p>

<p><img src="https://www.marcoieni.com/2020/12/rust-makes-cross-compilation-childs-play/rust-gh.png" alt="gh template releases" title="Releases"></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-github/rust-gh-example/blob/01e0aae91f83e1e932f4498a0eddb2905c8fffc3/.github/workflows/cd.yml#L57-L63">This</a>
is an example of the resulting Continuous Deployment step.</p>

<p>And that was it, after I spent a lot of <em>very useful</em> time trying to setup compilation dependencies basically I just wanted to share my love for the <code>cross</code>
tool with the rest of the world in order to avoid this pain to as many people as possible. 😅</p>

<p>Thanks for reading this far! You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/MarcoIeni">twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/MarcoIeni">YouTube</a>, bye! 👋</p>

Transcend makes privacy laws easy for engineers and lawyers alike. In that spirit, we've transcribed this law into something easily referenceable.</p></span></p></div></div></div></section><section><div><div><div><div name="Section1"><h2>SEC. 1. Title.</h2><p>This measure shall be known and may be cited as "The California Privacy Rights Act of 2020."</p></div><div name="Section2"><h2>SEC. 2. Findings and Declarations.<!-- --> </h2><p>The People of the State of California hereby find and declare all of the following:</p><p>A. In 1972, California voters amended the California Constitution to include the right of privacy among the "Inalienable" rights of all people. Voters acted in response to the accelerating encroachment on personal freedom and security caused by increased data collection and usage in contemporary society. The amendment established a legal and enforceable constitutional right of privacy for every Californian. Fundamental to this right of privacy is the ability of individuals to control the use, including the sale, of their personal information.</p><p>B. Since California voters approved the constitutional right of privacy, the California Legislature has adopted specific mechanisms to safeguard Californians' privacy, including the Online Privacy Protection Act, the Privacy Rights for California Minors in the Digital World Act, and Shine the Light, but consumers had no right to learn what personal information a business had collected about them and how they used it or to direct businesses not to sell the consumer's personal information.</p><p>C. That changed in 2018, when more than 629,000 California voters signed petitions to qualify the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 for the ballot. In response to the measure's qualification, the Legislature enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) into law. The CCPA gives California consumers the right to learn what information a business has collected about them, to delete their personal information, to stop businesses from selling their personal information, including using it to target them with ads that follow them as they browse the internet from one website to another, and to hold businesses accountable if they do not take reasonable steps to safeguard their personal information.</p><p>D. Even before the CCPA had gone into effect, the Legislature considered many bills in 2019 to amend the law, some of which would have significantly weakened it. Unless California voters take action, the hard-fought rights consumers have won could be undermined by future legislation.</p><p>E. Rather than diluting privacy rights, California should strengthen them over time. Many businesses collect and use consumers' personal information, sometimes without consumers' knowledge regarding the business's use and retention of their personal information. In practice, consumers are often entering into a form of contractual arrangement in which while they do not pay money for a good or service, they exchange access to that good or service in return for access to their attention, or access to their personal information. Because the value of the personal information they are exchanging for the good or service is often opaque, depending on the practices of the business, consumers often have no good way to value the transaction. In addition, the terms of agreement or policies in which the arrangements are spelled out, are often complex, unclear, and as a result most consumers never have the time to read or understand them.</p><p>F. This asymmetry of information makes it difficult for consumers to understand what they are exchanging and therefore to negotiate effectively with businesses. Unlike in other areas of the economy where consumers can comparison shop, or can understand at a glance if a good or service is expensive or affordable, it is hard for the consumer to know how much his or her information is worth to any given business, when data use practices vary so widely between businesses.</p><p>G. The State therefore has an interest in mandating laws that will allow consumers to understand more fully how their information is being used, and for what purposes. In the same way that ingredient labels on foods help consumers shop more effectively, disclosure around data management practices will help consumers become more informed counterparties in the data economy, and promote competition, Additionally, if a consumer can tell a business not to sell his or her data, then that consumer will not have to scour a privacy policy to see whether the business is, In fact, selling that data, and the resulting savings in time is worth, in the aggregate, a tremendous amount of money.</p><p>H. Consumers need stronger laws to place them on a more equal footing when negotiating with businesses in order to protect their rights, Consumers should be entitled to a clear explanation of the uses of their personal information, including how it is used for advertising, and to control, correct, or delete it, Including by allowing consumers to limit businesses' use of their sensitive personal information to help guard against identity theft, to opt-out of the sale and sharing of their personal information, and to request that businesses correct inaccurate information about them.</p><p>I. California is the world leader in many new technologies that have reshaped our society. The world today is unimaginable without the internet, one of the most momentous inventions in human history, and the new services and businesses that arose on top of it -- many of which were invented here in California. One of the most successful business models for the internet has been services that rely on advertising to make money as opposed to charging consumers a fee. Advertising-supported services have existed for generations, and can be a great model for consumers and businesses alike. However, some advertising businesses today use technologies and tools that are opaque to consumers to collect and trade vast amounts of personal information, to track them across the internet, and to create detailed profiles of their individual interests. Some companies that do not charge consumers a fee, subsidize these services by monetizing consumers' personal information. Consumers should have the information and tools necessary to limit the use of their information to non-invasive, pro-privacy advertising, where their personal information is not sold to or shared with hundreds of businesses they've never heard of, If they choose to do so. Absent these tools, it will be virtually impossible for consumers to fully understand these contracts they are essentially entering into when they interact with various businesses.</p><p>J. Children are particularly vulnerable from a negotiating perspective with respect to their privacy rights. Parents should be able to control what information is collected and sold or shared about their young children and should be given the right to demand that companies erase information collected about their children.</p><p>K. Business should also be held directly accountable to consumers for data security breaches and notify consumers when their most sensitive information has been compromised.</p><p>L. An independent watchdog whose mission is to protect consumer privacy should ensure that businesses and consumers are well-informed about their rights and obligations and should vigorously enforce the law against businesses that violate consumers' privacy rights.</p></div><div name="Section3"><h2>SEC. 3. Purpose and Intent.</h2><p>In enacting this Act, It is the purpose and intent of the people of the State of California to further protect consumers' rights, including the constitutional right of privacy. The implementation of this Act shall be guided by the following principles:</p><h3>A. Consumer Rights</h3><p>1. Consumers should know who is collecting their personal information and that of their children, how it is being used, and to whom it is disclosed, so that they have the information necessary to exercise meaningful control over businesses' use of their personal information and that of their children,</p><p>2. Consumers should be able to control the use of their personal information, Including limiting the use of their sensitive personal information, the unauthorized use or disclosure of which creates a heightened risk of harm to the consumer, and they should have meaningful options over how it is collected, used, and disclosed.</p><p>3. Consumers should have access to their personal information and should be able to correct it, delete it, and take it with them from one business to another.</p><p>4. Consumers or their authorized agents should be able to exercise these options through easily accessible self-serve tools.</p><p>5. Consumers should be able to exercise these rights without being penalized for doing so.</p><p>6. Consumers should be able to hold businesses accountable for falling to take reasonable precautions to protect their most sensitive personal information from hackers and security breaches.</p><p>7. Consumers should benefit from businesses' use of their personal information.</p><p>8. The privacy interests of employees and independent contractors should also be protected, taking into account the differences in the relationship between employees or independent contractors and businesses, as compared to the relationship between consumers and businesses. In addition, this law is not intended to interfere with the right to organize and collective bargaining under the National Labor Relations Act. It is the purpose and intent of the Act to extend the exemptions in this title for employee and business to business communications until January 1, 2023.</p><h3>B. The Responsibilities of Businesses</h3><p>1. Businesses should specifically and clearly inform consumers about how they collect and use personal information and how they can exercise their rights and choice.</p><p>2. Businesses should only collect consumers' personal information for specific, explicit, and legitimate disclosed purposes, and should not further collect, use, or disclose consumers' personal information for reasons incompatible with those purposes.</p><p>3. Businesses …</p></div></div></div></div></section></main></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>The corner of the internet that I read is awash with posts about feature stores: systems that aim to be <a href="https://blog.feast.dev/post/what-is-a-feature-store">“the interface between models and data.”</a></p>

<p>This idea has been around for quite a while, but there are now an increasing number of companies that are building feature store platforms or products–the concept is becoming established in the machine learning system <em>operations</em> arena.</p>

<p>A few months ago, I built a feature store at <a href="https://monzo.com/">Monzo</a>; in light of that, I thought I’d share some of the thinking that motivated my team to need to build one and how I designed it.</p>

<p>As a broad summary: the feature store that I built does not solve for the many different use cases that you may hear about feature store products–our feature store focuses on regularly and safely transferring data between our analytics and production stacks.</p>

<p>Let’s begin!</p>

<h2 id="-isnt-a-feature-store-just-a-database">🤔 Isn’t a feature store just a database?</h2>

<p>Well, yes. But also no.</p>

<p>When I first started talking about the idea of a feature store internally, some feedback that I received was ‘we already do this–we just haven’t been calling them feature stores.’ Indeed, the emphasis of the name “feature store” has often been on the “<strong>store</strong>” aspect, which does make the whole thing sound like it is just a database. The word “<strong>feature</strong>” is often used to mean “some type of data” (e.g., a column in a table).</p>

<p>At Monzo, you can’t look at any corner of our <a href="https://qconlondon.com/london2020/presentation/modern-banking-1500-microservices">production infrastructure</a> without running into the key-value store we use, Cassandra. In our systems, it’s common for each microservice to have its own keyspace, and for individual services to collect, aggregate, and store the different types of data that they need.</p>

<p>We already had two patterns across several systems which looked like “feature stores:”</p>

<ol>
  <li>Services that receive a request, fan out a bunch of calls to other services, and then munge and store the resulting features. For example, we have a system that filters help articles, and caches features about users, who will be actively navigating the content.</li>
  <li>Services that consume events from streams to construct features about different entities. For example, we have a system that consumes events that occur when chat messages are sent and received, and can then serve requests for features about conversations (e.g., the number of turns).</li>
</ol>

<p>What this means is that data across our keyspaces is typically organised around the systems that they serve: we design a system first (e.g., a system for user accounts), and the features it holds follows from that design (data about user accounts).</p>

<h2 id="-whats-different-about-feature-stores">🧐 What’s different about “feature stores?”</h2>

<p>The idea of a feature store is different because it is a system that is meant to prospectively hold a <em>wide diversity</em> of data–nearly anything that could be valuable input to machine learning models. The “features” could even be the output of <em>other</em> machine learning models (predictions or embeddings).</p>

<p>I think this is an important point because this inverts how data is organised in a production system. With a feature store, you can build a separation of concerns between the systems that generate data and the aggregations of that data that are input into ML models. If you want stats about user accounts, you no longer need to know about user account system– you <em>just</em> query the feature store.</p>

<p>The main reason that is often stated for having a centralised place for features is that they are <em>meant to be reused</em> to solve different problems. For example, let’s say that I’m building a feature, like “average number of transactions in the last 7 days.” This feature could potentially be very useful to a whole host of <em>different</em> machine learning models. If we were going to store this data inside of the system that uses it, we may end up:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Having to rebuild the same feature in more than one place, and</li>
  <li>Making it very difficult to discover what features are available for reuse across problems.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="-pause-do-these-two-problems-actually-matter">⏸ Pause: do these two problems actually matter?</h3>

<p>Before I carry on to describe our feature store, I’ll pause to reiterate a word of warning that I mentioned in <a href="http://nlathia.github.io/2020/11/Why-ML-code.html">my last blog post</a>. Building something <em>twice</em> may, at first glance, sound like a waste of time. Folks pitching feature stores often tend to drive home that point. However, in some critical use cases, building something twice can help to validate the system’s correctness.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/danielchatfield">one of our Staff Engineers</a> told me, “the types of mistakes that you can make when writing SQL <em>are very different</em> from the types of mistakes you can make when writing Go.” Reimplementing a feature from SQL to Go provides us with two outputs which we can use for reconciliation: if both spit back the same number, we can be more confident the implementations are correct.</p>

<p>In short: the “only code things once” pitch doesn’t actually work for all use cases.</p>

<p>The second point, regarding discovering features for reuse across problems, is also contentious. You could imagine putting all of your features into a set of wide relational tables. At some point, centralising all of the data would come hand-in-hand with a loss of context about what that data means, and how it should be used. Once you have 1000s of features, a central list of them becomes difficult to navigate.</p>

<p>For example, if you had a feature that describes a user as <code>is_inactive</code>, what does that <em>actually</em> mean, and does that definition fit with the new use case?  How do you ensure that the feature store’s documentation for this remain lined up with the upstream system that is generating the raw data? How do you avoid ending up with multiple implementations of the same <em>concept</em>, expressed as variants of the same code, ad nauseam?</p>

<p>So the “discover all your features” is also a slightly trickier problem that “just put them all in one place.”</p>

<h2 id="-narrowing-down-the-problem-space">🔍 Narrowing down the problem space</h2>

<p>If you open up the website of your favourite company that is offering a feature store, it’s more than likely that they’ll have a list of five to ten (sometimes more!) problems that their feature store solves: integrations, data sources, consistency, monitoring, versioning, meta-data and documentation, training dataset creation, production serving, and so on.</p>

<p><em>It’s mind boggling.</em></p>

<p>Up front, I decided that I had no desire to migrate any of our existing systems to sit behind any kind of centralised “feature store” API. I didn’t want the feature store to become a replacement for things that already existed, or a behemoth that is owned by my (small) team. Instead, I learned about what we needed by looking for patterns in the machine learning models that we were shipping.</p>

<p>Specifically, we didn’t need a feature store until this year, when we ramped up how often we were designing and shipping machine learning models that were trained on tabular data (systems we built prior were very NLP-heavy).</p>

<p>When shipping tabular-based models, we kept finding that many of the features we would input into a model while training it were <em>not</em> readily available in our production infrastructure. A large part of this is because our <a href="https://cloud.google.com/customers/monzo">analytics stack</a>, where all of our Data Scientists and Analysts contribute, sits separately from our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/monzo/">production stack</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s a toy example: a customer’s account balance, accurate to this specific moment, is already available in production–so doesn’t need to be in a feature store. <em>But</em> aggregations on a customer’s balance (e.g., a customer’s 7-day average balance) were not, even though these numbers were already available in our <em>analytics</em>, based on SQL queries that Data Scientists had previously written.</p>

<p>We found that we already had an abundance of features in our analytics tables that, if used in production, would specifically be characterised by:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Having values that change “slowly.” These are different types of aggregations, like averages and counts, that we wanted to use, but specifically did not need them to be accurate up to the latest microsecond.</li>
  <li>Being easy to implement in BigQuery SQL, on our historical data, but would be harder (or, more simply, a lot of work) to rebuild and backfill in our production environment.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our problem, therefore, narrowed down to “we need a subset of the numbers, that only exist in our analytics, in production.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first couple of times that anyone in my team ran into this, we queried BigQuery directly from our services, and cached the results. Job done. Over time, the pattern started becoming clearer: we were bound to regularly need this <em>bridge</em> between BigQuery and Cassandra, and didn’t want to rebuild it every single time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This narrowed down the purpose and value-add for a building a feature store in our system: <em>enabling</em> the safe reuse of slow-changing features from our analytics, in production.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="-our-analytics-feature-store">🏪 Our analytics feature store</h2>

<p>What we have today is a system that automates the journey of shipping features between our analytics (BigQuery) and production (Cassandra) databases.</p>

<p>The process starts with a Data Scientist writing some SQL, as they usually do. They tag it as a query that builds a feature table. These tables are automaticaly scheduled and generated alongside all of our other analytics tables, at varying frequencies (daily, hourly, etc.), using Airflow. We use <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/">dbt</a>, and so each query will be written with <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/tests/">tests</a>.</p>

<p>By design, feature tables must specificy a <code>subject_type</code> column. This defines the entity that the feature described, such as a “user” feature or a “sort code” feature. The table must also have a corresponding <code>subject_id</code>, which is the actual ID of the user for that row. The schema of this table is replicated in the feature store Go service, because we do not want it to “blindly” ingest data.</p>

<p>The creation of feature tables is monitored: a cron jobs regularly checks whether those tables should be sync’ed into Cassandra. A table should be sync’ed if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It has been recreated (compared to the last time it was sync’ed), and;</li>
  <li>It passes data validation tests (i.e., it doesn’t accidentally have garbage in it);</li>
</ul>

<p>When a table needs to be sync’ed, it gets partitioned into batches and then exported as line-delimited JSON into …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Sometimes people ask me what they should learn to become a better programmer. I feel like the default recommendation here is usually an obscure programming language or a textbook on some high-powered machinery like ML. So I always feel a little bit embarrassed and boring when I instead suggest going really deep on what you already know: your main programming language, web framework, object-relational mapper, UI library, version control system, database, Unix tools, etc. It’s not shiny or esoteric, but for me, building a detailed mental model of those (and how they compare to alternatives) might be the learning that’s contributed most to my effectiveness as an engineer.</p><p>A coworker coined the phrase “blub studies” to refer to this sort of mundane, ultra-specific-seeming knowledge. “Blub” comes from a Paul Graham essay, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html" target="_blank">Beating the Averages</a>, in which Blub is a hypothetical middlebrow language whose programmers get defensive when Graham asserts that Lisp is superior. Blub studies is the study of what goes on in the guts of these boring, everyday systems—not the kind you get tenure for inventing, but the kind people actually use.</p><p>Blub studies is a never-ending treadmill of engineering know-how. It’s the fiddly technical details of how Git stores data, or how Postgres locking semantics <a href="https://gocardless.com/blog/zero-downtime-postgres-migrations-the-hard-parts/" target="_blank">caused your migration to bring down prod</a>, or why <code>pip install</code> failed <em>this</em> time. It’s what goes on inside the boiler rooms of your computer. There’s a seemingly infinite amount of it, full of bespoke details for you to stumble over, and that makes it, often, unbelievably frustrating. Experts in shiny fields like machine learning write shiny-sounding articles like <em><a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2018/01/31/a-theory-of-the-learnable/" target="_blank">A theory of the learnable</a></em>; experts in blub studies emit screeds like <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/" target="_blank">The Law of Leaky Abstractions</a> and <a href="https://www.stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks" target="_blank">Programming Sucks</a>.</p><p>In short, if you’re in search of generalizable knowledge that <a href="https://fs.blog/2019/02/compounding-knowledge/" target="_blank">compounds exponentially over time</a>, then blub studies looks like the crap you have to wade through to get to the good stuff. So it’s easy to see why people give up on understanding all the blub they’re surrounded by, except what they need to get the job done.</p><p>But for me, the opposite attitude has been more productive. <a href="https://blog.nelhage.com/post/computers-can-be-understood/" target="_blank">Computers can be understood</a>—even if it’s hard and takes a while. Blub studies is more generalizable than it seems, and has its own way of compounding over time, too. That makes it a lot more useful than you’d expect.<sup><label for="sn0">✻</label><span><span><sup>✻</sup>
Of course, there are useless parts of blub studies: if this essay gets you excited to memorize a bunch of command-line flags, consider <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/24/should-you-reverse-any-advice-you-hear/" target="_blank">reversing this advice</a>. But in my experience, it’s more common to neglect the useful parts of blubs, than to over-index on trivia.</span></span></sup></p><hr><p>The most straightforward benefit of blub expertise is that it saves you time. <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt/status/1305214228991750144" target="_blank">“You can’t apply those brilliant insights you learned from SICP if you don’t have the knowledge base and emotional fortitude to fight through <code>pip install</code> first."</a> If you know how Git’s internal model works, you can get your repository out of its borked state without spending hours on Stack Overflow.</p><p>This effect is larger than it might seem. If you’re working with a system you don’t understand, you’re limited to debugging via guess-and-check, which can be arbitrarily slow. A more efficient method would be to <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1265360282513281025?lang=en" target="_blank">get as much information as possible about your program’s execution</a> and then use that information to exclude most of the hypothesis space. But this requires a good understanding of both the system, and the tools available for inspecting it. If you’re tracking down, say, a networking problem, staring at some <code>tcpdump</code> output will often get you most of the way there, but only if you know how to interpret it and what to look for.</p><p>If you spend half your programming time debugging, and being a blub expert lets you debug twice as fast, then just the speed gain from blub expertise will let you increase your output by a third.<sup><label for="sn1">†</label><span><span><sup>†</sup>
If you think “half of programming time debugging” sounds high, imagine how much faster you’d be if all your code worked the first time.<p>Doubling debugging speed is probably a conservative estimate—you can save pretty much unlimited time via things like <a href="http://rachelbythebay.com/w/2020/10/14/lag/" target="_blank">“hmm, 40 milliseconds sounds like the timeout for Nagle’s algorithm, try setting <code>TCP_NODELAY</code>”</a>. I somewhat frequently debug tricky things 5x+ faster than coworkers, just because I’ve been working with our stack for a long time, so I know where to look for problems and how to quickly test hypotheses.</p></span></span></sup> That justifies a lot of time staring at <code>tcpdump</code> output! But there are also more subtle reasons I’ve gotten so much from blub studies. It’s both more general, lasts longer, and has more of a compounding effect, than I expected.</p><hr><p>Blub studies are surprisingly broadly applicable because, even if you’re learning about the details of some specific blubby system, that system’s design will contain a juicy non-blubby core of extractible general principles. Unlike many “general principles” people try to teach you, the ones you learn via blub studies are guaranteed to be important to at least one real-world system (the one you’re learning about). And you’ll see them realized in all their messy detail, which academic presentations often leave out.</p><p>Suppose your blub of choice is React. You might worry that learning the gory details will be useless if you ever move to a different part of the stack, or even a different web framework. And, yes, some of them will. But the core idea of React—writing pure render functions, using <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html" target="_blank">reconciliation</a> to make updates fast—is extremely powerful and general. In fact, it’s now been copied by the next generation of UI frameworks on both iOS (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/" target="_blank">SwiftUI</a>) and Android (<a href="https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose" target="_blank">Jetpack Compose</a>). Learning the principles behind React makes it easier to learn those other frameworks. In fact, it can even be a useful source of ideas to “import” from one to the other. At Wave, for instance, we’ve gotten a lot of mileage out of importing ideas from <a href="https://relay.dev/" target="_blank">Relay</a> into our mobile apps.</p><p>This is a good example of an idea that, as far as I know, you can <em>only</em> learn about through blub studies. Academia didn’t give much attention to React-style UI programming. In fact, it doesn’t seem to view user-interface programming paradigms as a particularly interesting object of study at all. People do sometimes publish on it but, for instance, I couldn’t find any courses on it in MIT’s extensive course catalog.<sup><label for="sn2">‡</label><span><span><sup>‡</sup>
You could argue that this is because UI programming is “too applied” and one shouldn’t expect it to be covered in an academic curriculum. But computer science covers many other equally-“applied” areas, like networking, databases, operating systems, and graphics.</span></span></sup></p><hr><p>Blub studies also compound more than you’d naively expect, in two ways. First, knowing about one blub makes it easier to learn about alternative blubs that serve the same purpose—like the React/SwiftUI example above. Second, knowing more about one blub helps you learn blubs in <em>adjacent</em> parts of the stack more quickly.</p><p>Once, while pair programming with a more junior coworker, we were writing a complicated SQLAlchemy query. My coworker used <code>user.name</code> (the <code>name</code> field of an object stored in the <code>user</code> variable) instead of <code>User.name</code> (the <code>name</code> field of the <em>class</em> <code>User</code>) and was wondering why her query gave the wrong results. I tried to explain the “magic” by which <code>User.name</code> was an instance of <code>Column</code> while <code>user.name</code> was a simple <code>str</code>. I went around in circles for a little while until I eventually explained Python’s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/descriptor.html" target="_blank">descriptor protocol</a> to her (the language feature SQLAlchemy uses to enable the “declarative” ORM syntax). At that point, everything clicked—and I realized that Python’s <code>__dunder__</code> methods are the key to decoding quite a lot of “magical” seeming code. If you learn the Python language features well, lots of complicated libraries will become a lot easier to understand.</p><p>I had a similar experience myself with Kubernetes. The first time I tried to learn it, it was a bewildering morass of jargon—all those namespaces and containers and Pods and Deployments and Services and Ingresses just to get a simple HTTP server running! Then I read <a href="http://intronetworks.cs.luc.edu/" target="_blank">a networking textbook</a> and everything made much more sense. The (arguably) most complicated parts of Kubernetes exist to solve networking-related problems—allowing hundreds of containers to talk to each other independently while hosted on a much smaller set of computers—so the networking textbook gave me a schema onto which I could hang all my Kubernetes factoids. Once I knew how Linux’s IP routing, iptables, and network namespaces worked, it was much easier for me to understand what exactly something like “kube-proxy” was doing.</p><p>If you know enough different blubs, you can end up at the point where you don’t even need to look things up to figure out how they’re (probably) implemented. An experienced Python programmer can guess immediately how SQLAlchemy’s “declarative” ORM works under the hood. That’s the point when your blub expertise will really start compounding—almost as soon as you start working with something new, you’ll start figuring out how it works and extracting the kernel of generally-interesting ideas.</p><hr><p>Because of this compounding effect, the most important step toward becoming a blub master is to kickstart your “blub flywheel”—the virtuous cycle of blub accumulation—however you can. That means starting with whichever blubs are the easiest or most motivating to learn, and branching out from there. For me, the easiest place to start has been with blubs I’m already using at my day job. I have a couple strategies for getting the most out of those.</p><p>First, I’ll try to <em>go deeper than necessary</em>. If I really want to ship something, it’s easy to give into temptation to, say, Google an error message, copy-paste a fix from Stack Overflow, and move on with my day. But it often doesn’t take that much longer to actually read the error message, understand what it means, and try to figure out <em>why</em> that Stack Overflow answer fixed my problem. Similarly, if I’m stuck in a tricky yak shave, I’ll bias against “guess-and-check” style …</p></article></div>

<p>It was in the ’90s and shareware was still cool. I had written a couple of small shareware programs and I was worried about bugs related to dates and times.</p>

<p>So I wrote a new program called DateDesist.</p>

<p>DateDesist allowed me to test how my program would behave on specific dates. It was a fairly simple command line program. What it did was change the date on the machine, execute the program to be tested, wait a few seconds, then restore the date and exit.</p>

<p>It worked incredibly well for testing date-based shareware and making sure that programs expired when they were intended to.</p>

<p>I found it useful for my own testing and wanted to release it for other developers. So I package it up and released it on a bunch of shareware sites such as Tucows, SoftSeek and Freeware Home.</p>

<p>Sometime later I went looking for a <em>crack</em> for a piece of software that I was having trouble getting. I pulled up HotBot (my preferred search engine at the time) and quickly found what I was looking for. I downloaded the archive and took a look at the files inside.</p>

<p>There, I found the typical readme file with a short description of the program it was intended to crack and some ASCII art with the name of the cracking crew. Also included was a copy of my original DateDesist executable and a batch file to launch the target program on a specific date.</p>

<p>Now curious, I searched the web again for other cracks made by the same crew. To my surprise DateDesist had been used in dozens, maybe hundreds, of different cracks that were released by this group. I checked other cracks from other groups on the same sites and found DateDesist used in a significant number of them.</p>

<![CDATA[Running Erlang Releases Without EPMD on OTP 23.1]]>

December 5, 2020 | https://blog.erlware.org/epmdlessless/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.erlware.org/epmdlessless/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <div>
        <p>Erlang/OTP deployments that want to provide shell access or cluster nodes relied
on something called the Erlang Port Mapper Daemon (EPMD), a separate process
that handled all distribution mechanisms. Previous attempts at working around
this requirement used third party dependencies such as
<a href="https://github.com/tsloughter/epmdless">epmdless</a> and required specific
configuration arguments to the VM to setup. This was not ideal and was easy to
get wrong.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.erlang.org/news/141">Erlang/OTP 23.1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/erlware/relx/releases/tag/v4.2.0">relx 4.2</a> (included in <a href="https://blog.erlware.org/epmdlessless/">Rebar3 3.14.3</a>) it is now possible
to conveniently run Erlang releases without relying on EPMD for opening a
remote shell or clustering nodes. This is particularly going to make Erlang releases
simpler to configure in locked down environments, and easier to use with containers.</p>
<p>EPMD is a separate process that is started, if
not already running, when an Erlang node boots with distribution enabled –
meaning <code>-sname</code> or <code>-name</code> is passed to the boot command. The new node <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/erl_dist_protocol.html#epmd-protocol">talks to
the EPMD process</a> to register its name with a port that the node will also bind
to. When a node wants to connect to another one it must look up the port the other
node is listening on through EPMD. This is required both for
clustering nodes together and connecting a remote shell on the command line –
which is essentially the same as clustering because a new node is started before
attaching to the remote node to bring up a shell on that node.</p>
<p>Bypassing EPMD has been made possible through a couple new options added to <code>erl</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/commit/c21bbb6136a1f4d343c3cf53476107e78221a68f"><code>-erl_epmd_port P</code></a>: Configures the port this node will listen on and use when
connecting to remote nodes.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/commit/7a7c90be0e87cb3b4920de5aaf215c4b9cebcb30"><code>-dist_listen false</code></a>:
Setting this keeps the node from binding to the port, preventing it from
acting as a server, and instead uses the port only for connecting to remote
nodes. The use case for this is when opening a remote shell <code>-remsh &lt;node&gt;</code>
(<code>remote_console</code> in the release script) to a local node.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/commit/61b1ad3c57f4e92fb9b55f97b9ffd9dee80067e2"><code>-[s]name undefined</code></a>:
Passing <code>undefined</code> for the short or long name of a node generates a unique node
name and sets additional flags, <code>-dist_listen false -hidden -dist_auto_connect never</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>An extra option has also been added to <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/man/erl_call.html"><code>erl_call</code></a> :</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/commit/ce4fcf0640d81a268c15af339a888406b757ced5"><code>-address P</code></a>:
Sets the address and/or port to connect to the running Erlang node. This
removes the need to look up the remote node or to even specify its name when
running <code>erl_call</code>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/commit/3a57ed212befae5d0e03569408849e8a72122911"><code>-R</code></a>: Tells <code>erl_call</code> to use a dynamic random name for the hidden node it starts.</li>
</ul>
<p>As of OTP 23.1+ the <code>relx</code> generated release script uses <code>erl_call</code> instead of
the custom <code>escript</code> <code>nodetool</code> when the commands <code>rpc</code> and <code>eval</code> are used to
run code on a running node.</p>
<p>These options are used automatically by the release shell script when starting a
node, opening a remote shell or interacting with the running node through <code>rpc</code>
and <code>eval</code>. The only change you as a user must make to run your release without
<code>epmd</code> is to set the OS environment variable <code>ERL_DIST_PORT</code>.</p>
<p>When <code>ERL_DIST_PORT</code> is set in the environment the option to not start EPMD
(<code>-start_epmd false</code>) is added to the <code>erl</code> arguments automatically, along with
<code>-erl_epmd_port ${ERL_DIST_PORT}</code>. The <code>ERL_DIST_PORT</code> is also used by
<code>erl_call</code> with <code>-address ${ERL_DIST_PORT}</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tsloughter/epmdlessless">epmdlessless</a> is an example project
that comes with a
<a href="https://github.com/tsloughter/epmdlessless/blob/main/docker-compose.yml">docker-compose.yml</a>
setup that makes it simple to play with these new features. Note that no changes are
required to <code>vm.args.src</code> to disable EPMD or set a port to use, the only
configuration done is through the environment variable <code>ERL_DIST_PORT</code> in
<code>docker-compose.yml</code>:</p>
<pre><code>    ...
    environment:
      - ERL_DIST_PORT=8001
    ...
</code></pre><p>Note that each node must listen on the same port because setting
<code>-erl_epmd_port P</code> tells Erlang both what port to listen on and what port to use
when connecting to other nodes.</p>
<p>After cloning the repo, build the Docker image and start 3 nodes (<code>node_a</code>, <code>node_b</code>, <code>node_c</code>):</p>

<p>It is important to note that this requires every node to listen on the same
port, which requires every node to have its own IP. If this isn’t an option, or
for whatever reason you need to use separate ports for nodes, then <a href="https://github.com/tsloughter/epmdless">epmdless</a>
is an option to replace EPMD and track the node to port mapping. But if you are
running with containers in an environment like Kubernetes you can now keep EPMD
from running in each container by simply upgrading Erlang and Rebar3, and
setting the <code>ERL_DIST_PORT</code> environment variable.</p>

<p>Security researchers are alarmed: the already-notorious Trickbot malware has been spotted probing infected computers to find out which version of UEFI they're running. This is read as evidence that Trickbot has figured out how to pull off a really scary feat.</p>
<p>To understand why, you have to understand UEFI: a fascinating, deep, philosophical change to our view of computers, trust, and the knowability of the universe. It's a tale of hard choices, paternalism, and the race to secure the digital realm as it merges with the physical.</p>
<p>Computers were once standalone: a central processing unit that might be augmented by some co-processors for specialized processes, like a graphics card or even a math co-processor.</p>
<p>These co-pros were subordinate to the CPU though. You'd turn on the computer and it would read a very small set of hardcoded instructions telling it how to access a floppy disk or other storage medium for the rest of the boot sequence, the stuff needed to boot the system.</p>
<p>The hardwired instructions were in a ROM that had one job: wake up and feed some instructions to the "computer" telling it what to do, then go back to sleep. But there's a philosophical conundrum here.</p>
<p>Because the world of computing is adversarial and networked computing is doubly so: there are people who want your computer to do things that are antithetical to your interests, like steal your data or spy on you or encrypt all your files and demand ransom.</p>
<p>To stop this, you need to be able to examine the programs running on your computer and terminate the malicious ones. And therein lies the rub: when you instruct your computer to examine its own workings, how do you know if you can trust it?</p>
<p>In 1983, Ken Thompson (co-creator of C, Unix, etc) was awarded a Turing Award ("computer science's Nobel Prize"). He gave a fucking bombshell of an acceptance speech, called "Reflections on Trusting Trust."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rdriley/487/papers/Thompson_1984_ReflectionsonTrustingTrust.pdf">https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rdriley/487/papers/Thompson_1984_ReflectionsonTrustingTrust.pdf</a></p>
<p>Thompson revealed that he had created a backdoor for himself that didn't just live in Unix, but in the C compiler that people made to create new Unix systems.</p>
<p>Here's what that means: when you write a program, you produce "high-level code" with instructions like "printf("Hello, World!");". Once your program is done, you turn it into machine code, a series of much shorter instructions that your CPU understands ("mov  dx, msg" etc).</p>
<p>Most programmers can't read this machine code, and even for those who can, it's a hard slog. In general, we write our code, compile it and run it, but we don't examine it. With nontrivial programs, looking at the machine code is very, very hard.</p>
<p>Compilers are treated as intrinsically trustworthy. Give 'em some source, they spit out a binary, you run the binary. Sometimes there are compiler bugs, sure, and compiler improvements can be a big deal. But compilers are infrastructure: inscrutable and forgotten.</p>
<p>Here's what Thompson did: he hid a program in his compiler that would check to see whether you were compiling an operating system or a compiler. If you were compiling an OS, it hid a secret login for him inside of it.</p>
<p>If you were compiling a compiler, it hid the program that looked for compilers or operating systems inside of it.</p>
<p>Think about what this means: every OS you compiled had an intentional security defect that the OS itself couldn't detect.</p>
<p>If you suspected that your compiler was up to no good and wrote your own compiler, it would be compromised as soon as you compiled it. What Thompson did was ask us to contemplate what we meant when we "trusted" something.</p>
<p>It was a move straight out of Rene Descartes, the reasoning that leads up to "I think therefore I am." Descartes' "Discourse on the Method" asks how we can know things about the universe.</p>
<p>He points out that sometimes he thinks he senses something but is wrong – he dreams, he hallucinates, he misapprehends.</p>
<p>If all our reasoning depends on the impressions we get from our senses, and if our senses are sometimes faulty, how can we reason at all?</p>
<p>Descartes wants a point of certainty, one thing he <em>knows</em> to be absolutely true. He makes the case that if you can be certain of one thing, you can anchor everything else to this point and build up a massive edifice of trustable knowledge that all hangs off of this anchor.</p>
<p>Thompson is basically saying, "You thought you had descartesed your way into a trustable computing universe because of the axiom that I would never poison your lowest-level, most fundamental tools.</p>
<p>"<em>Wrong</em>.</p>
<p>"Bwahahahaha."</p>
<p>(But, you know, in a nice way: an object lesson to serve as a wake-up call before computers fully merged with the physical world to form a global, species-wide digital nervous system whose untrustworthy low-level parts were foolishly, implicitly trusted).</p>
<p>But processors were expensive and computers were exploding. PCs running consumer operating systems like Windows and Mac OS (and more exotic ones like GNU/Linux and various Unices) proliferated, and they all shared this flawed security model.</p>
<p>They all relied on the operating system to be a faithful reporter of the computer's internals, and operated on the assumption that they could use programs supervised by the OS to detect and terminate malicious programs.</p>
<p>But starting in 1999, Ken Thompson's revenge was visited upon the computing world. Greg Hoglund released Ntrootkit, a proof-of-concept malware that attacked Windows itself, so that the operating system would lie to antivirus programs about what it was doing and seeing.</p>
<p>In Decartesspeak, your computer could no longer trust its senses, so it could no longer reason. The nub of trust, the piton driven into the mountainface, was made insecure and the whole thing collapsed. Security researchers at big companies like Microsoft took this to heart.</p>
<p>In 2002, Peter Biddle and his team from Microsoft came to EFF to show us a new model for computing: "Trusted Computing" (codenamed "Palladium").</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020805211111/https://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2002/jul02/0724palladiumwp.asp">https://web.archive.org/web/20020805211111/https://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2002/jul02/0724palladiumwp.asp</a></p>
<p>Palladium proposed to give computers back their nub of Descartesian certainty. It would use a co-processor, but unlike a graphics card or a math co-pro, it would run before the CPU woke up and did its thing.</p>
<p>And unlike a ROM, it wouldn't just load up the boot sequence and go back to sleep.</p>
<p>This chip – today called a "Secure Enclave" or a "Trusted Platform Module" (etc) – would have real computing power, and it would remain available to the CPU at all times.</p>
<p>Inside the chip was a bunch of cool cryptographic stuff that provided the nub of certainty. At the start of the boot, the TPM would pull the first stages of the boot-code off of the drive, along with a cryptographic signature.</p>
<p>A quick crypto aside:</p>
<p>Crypto is code that mixes a key (a secret known to the user) with text to produce a scrambled text (a "ciphertext") that can only be descrambled by the key.</p>
<p>Dual-key crypto has two keys. What one scrambles, the other descrambles (and vice-versa).</p>
<p>With dual-key crypto, you keep one key secret (the "private key") and you publish the other one (the "public key"). If you scramble something with a private key, then anyone can descramble it with your public key and know it came from you.</p>
<p>If you scramble it <em>twice</em>, first with your private key and then with your friend's public key, then they can tell it came from you (because only your private key's ciphertexts can be descrambled with your public key).</p>
<p>And <em>you</em> can be certain that only they can read it (because only their private key can descramble messages that were scrambled with their public key).</p>
<p>Code-signing uses dual-key crypto to validate who published some code.</p>
<p>Microsoft can make a shorter version of its code (like a fingerprint) and then you scramble it with its private key. The OS that came with your computer has a copy of MSFT's public key. When you get an OS update, you can descramble the fingerprint with that built-in key.</p>
<p>If it matches the update, then you know that Microsoft signed it and it hasn't been tampered with on its way to you. If you trust Microsoft, you can run the update.</p>
<p>But…What if a virus replaces Microsoft's public keys with its own?</p>
<p>That's where Palladium's TPM comes in. It's got the keys hardcoded into it. Programs running on the CPU can only ask the TPM to do very limited things like ask it to sign some text, or to check the signature on some text.</p>
<p>It's a kind of god-chip, running below the most privileged level of user-accessible operations. By design, you – the owner of the computer – can demand things of it that it is technically capable of doing, and it can refuse you, and you can't override it.</p>
<p>That way, programs running even in the most privileged mode can't compromise it.</p>
<p>Back to our boot sequence: the TPM fetches some startup code from the disk along with a signature, and checks to see whether the OS has been signed by its manufacturer.</p>
<p>If not, it halts and shows you a scary error message. Game over, Ken Thompson!</p>
<p>It is a very cool idea, but it's also very scary, because the chip doesn't take orders from Descartes' omnibenevolent God.</p>
<p>It takes orders from Microsoft, a rapacious monopolist with a history of complicity with human rights abuses. Right from that very first meeting the brilliant EFF technologist Seth Schoen spotted this (and made the Descartes comparison):</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021004125515/http://vitanuova.loyalty.org/2002-07-05.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20021004125515/http://vitanuova.loyalty.org/2002-07-05.html</a></p>
<p>Seth identified a way of having your cake and eating it too: he proposed a hypothetical thing called an "owner override" – a physical switch that, when depressed, could be used to change which public keys lived in the chip.</p>
<p>This would allow owners …</p></div></article></div>

<hr>

<p>Most serious programmers have heard of Donald Knuth,
the man who coined the term <em>analysis of algorithms</em> in 1968
and pioneered many of the computer science fundamentals we use today.
Knuth is perhaps most famous for his ongoing magnum opus,
<em>The Art of Computer Programming</em>.</p>

<p>When the first volume of TAOCP was released that same year,
it was printed the way most books had been since the turn of the century:
with <em>hot metal</em> type.
Each individual letter was cast from molten lead,
then arranged into its line.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Matrixcase-bembo-16pts.jpg" alt="Monotype matrix case" height="400">
<figcaption>
A case of letter molds—or <em>matrices</em>—used by the Monotype caster,
the most commonly-used machine for printing books in the days of hot metal type.
Its main contemporary, the Linotype, molded entire lines at a time,
and was often used for printing newspapers.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These lines were clamped together to form pages of the book,
which were finally inked and pressed against paper.
By March of 1977, Knuth was ready for a second run of TAOCP, Volume&nbsp;2,
but he was horrified when he received the proofs.
Hot metal typesetting was an expensive, complicated, and time-consuming process,
so publishers had replaced it with phototypesetting,
which works by projecting characters onto film.
The new technology, while much cheaper and faster,
didn’t provide the same level of quality he had come to expect.</p>

<p>The average author would have resigned themselves to the change and moved on,
but Knuth took great pride in print quality,
especially for the mathematics in his books.
Around this time, he discovered an exciting new technology:
digital typesetting.
Instead of working with metal or film,
letters and shapes were built from tiny dots,
often packed together at over 1,000 per inch.
Inspired by this burgeoning tech and frustrated with the current state of affairs,
Knuth set off on one of the greatest yak shaves of all time.
For years, he paused all work on his books to create his own
digital typesetting system.
When the dust settled in 1978, Knuth had the first version of
<span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>It’s hard to understand how much of a revolution <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 was,
especially looking back from a time where anybody with a copy
of Word can be their own desktop publisher.
Adobe’s PDF wouldn’t exist for another decade, so Knuth
invented a device-independent format, DVI.
Scalable fonts were uncommon at the time, so Knuth created a system,
<span>METAFONT</span>
, to rasterize his characters into dots on the
page.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>
Perhaps most importantly, Knuth and his graduate students designed algorithms
to automatically hyphenate and justify lines of text into
beautifully-typeset paragraphs.</p>

<p>Here is where the timelines diverge.
In one, <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 was just the beginning.
Computer typography evolves rapidly as the decades go by,
building on Knuth’s prior work and
taking advantage of the million-fold increases we’ve seen in computing power.
Browsers, e-readers, and word processors deliver beautiful type
to every person who looks at a screen, with almost no effort from authors.</p>

<p>In the darker timeline… none of this happens.
<span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 is still some of the best we’ve got for computer typesetting.
It’s seen some impressive improvements,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>
but its core hasn’t changed much in decades.
To this day,
it doesn’t lay out more than one page at a time because 1980s computers didn’t
have enough RAM to do any better.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>
Almost no other software—except for a handful of professional layout
programs like Adobe InDesign—leverages any of the advances
<span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 made in line breaking and hyphenation.
Layout in Word, browsers, and even e-readers is a sad joke.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://assets.bitbashing.io/images/exa.png" alt="Mobile browser layout example" height="400">
<figcaption>
State of the art text layout in today's browsers. Mind the gaps.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I’m not sure what to make of this.
Maybe most people, outside a small cadre of designers and
enthusiasts, just don’t care about typography very much.
After all, the human brain is incredibly good glossing over minor details and
im<span>p</span>erfections when reading.
But even the design world seems largely unaware or indifferent to Knuth’s work.
Despite collaborations with famous type designers like Hermann Zapf,
you’ll find no mention of him in renowned books and documentaries on
the subject.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>
And parametric font families—just like the ones <span>METAFONT</span>
 offered in 1983—are
heralded in 2017 as “a new era of type design”.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>
It’s bizarre.</p>

<p>Good typography can make almost anything more enjoyable to read,
and it feels like such a shame that better layout isn’t
available to the masses
when so much of the groundwork was laid almost forty years ago.
In an age when the average American reads from a screen they keep in their pocket
dozens of times a day,
and where each one of those devices holds more processing power than you could
fit in several rooms back when Donald Knuth
wrote <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
, surely we can—and <em>should</em>—do better.</p>

        The Note is a gap analysis document.
        It identifieds the next steps
        for enabling
        Wide Color Gamut (WCG)
        and
        High Dynamic Range (HDR)
        on the Open Web Platform.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>The initial commercial application of Color Science
        (principally colorimetry, rather than color appearance modelling)
        to the reproduction of color
        was concerned with surface colors
        such as painted or printed objects,
        lit by a single illuminant.
        The achievable luminance range was thus constrained
        to the luminance of a perfect diffuse reflector
        (practically, an unprinted sheet of good paper)
        at the high end,
        and the densest printed or painted black
        that could be achieved without the paper tearing or deforming,
        at the darkest end. This produced luminance ranges
        from as low as 20:1
        to as high as 90:1 (Fairchild, p.399 [[Fairchild-CAM]]).
        The achievable Chroma range was also limited
        by the vibrancy of mass-produced paints and inks,
        and the prohibitive cost of using additional spot colors
        to extend the gamut.
        <!-- add UCS diagram of coated and uncoated FOGRA21 and 39 -->
        Self-luminous displays, in that commercial environment,
        were primarily used at low luminances
        for soft proofing of an eventual printed product,
        and were intended to replicate the appearance of a viewing booth.
      </p>

      <p>Over time, self-luminous displays were seen
        as a worthy color management target in their own right:
        for computer displays,
        for the display of digital photography,
        for digital cinema,
        and for the consumption of media such as television and movies in the home.
        The luminance range increased:
        media consumed in near-dark environments such as the cinema
        could have much deeper blacks,
        while media consumed in dim to normal viewing environments
        enjoyed an increased peak white luminance of 200 to 300 cd/m².
        The darkest blacks in such environments were constrained by viewing flare,
        which is why the sRGB standard mandated a viewing flare of 5%,
        typical for glossy glass CRT displays of the time;
        coupled with a peak luminance of only 80cd/m²
        the luminance range was still relatively modest.
        The introduction of matt LCD and OLED screens,
        and the commercial success of HDTV, increased the dynamic range somewhat,
        but it was still comfortable encoded in 8 bits per gamma-corrected component.
        This is referred to as <b>Standard Dynamic Range (SDR)</b>.
        The achievable Chroma range for sRGB and Rec.709 HDTV, although extending beyond that of printed material at the primaries, was also relatively modest.
        Wider gamut displays were available professionally,
        covering most of the Adobe 1998 RGB™ colorspace,
        but wre typically not found in a home or office environment.
        <!-- sRGB gamut on UCS diagram -->
      </p>

      Commercial availability of displays covering the Display P3 gamut
      (a derivative of DCI P3 used for digital cinema,
      but altered to account for a non-dark viewing environment,
      with an sRGB transfer curve ,and D65 white point)
      meant that <b>Wide Color Gamut (WCG)</b> displays became commonplace
      on laptops, external monitors, mobile phones, and even watches.
      WCG requires a modest increase in the
      number of bits per gamma-corrected component,
      from 8 to 10 or 12 (for the widest gamut
      in common use for content delivery,
      Rec.2020).

      <p>The deployment of 4k and then 8k television,
      accompanied by digital content delivery,
      brought not only a similarly increased color gamut
      to the media space, but also a greatly increased dynamic range
      of 4000:1 or more.
      Increased phosphor efficiency and purity,
      together with bright and modulatable backlights,
      brought <b>High Dynamic Range (HDR)</b> into widespread use.
      Computers, however, remained limited to SDR for the most part.</p>

      <p>
        The human visual system can,
        with appropriate adaptation,
        function over an enormous luminance range —
        from starlight or moonlight at 0.01 cd/m² and  0.1 cd/m²,
        through the dim lighting at dawn and dusk (10 cd/m²),
        office lighting (100 cd/m²),
        modern displays (800 cd/m²),
        overcast daylight (1,000 cd/m²),
        bright daylight (10,000 cd/m²)
        and full direct sunlight (100,000 cd/m²).
        However, the full range cannot be simultaneously percieved
        in the same scene
        at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two main
        systems defined for HDR video:
        Hyprid Log Gamma (HLG), developed by BBC and NHK, and
        Dolby Perceptual Quantizer (PQ).
        While improvement in video quality has driven the innovation of HDR,
        support for content on the web more generally, e.g., for static images,
        the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element, and in CSS in general, is still
        needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Add a brief description of PQ and HLG approaches, including: use of
        metadata, absolute vs relative brightness, proprietary vs open standard,
        etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        The BBC has published a frequently-asked questions document
        [[hdr-hlg-faq]] that gives a high level introduction to HDR, and the
        PQ and HLG solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fredrik Hubinette from Google has written a useful document
        [[hdr-chrome]] that discusses the issues with presenting, and in
        particular compositing, SDR and HDR content. This was presented at
        TPAC 2017. It considers both PQ and HLG. (<a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/11/07-colorweb-minutes.html">minutes
          of the TPAC 2017 meeting</a>)
      </p>

      <p>
        On the web, SDR, and HDR content using both HLG and PQ is expected to
        coexist, potentially within the same page, as authors can include
        arbitrary content in their web pages. An example is a page that contains
        multiple embedded videos, or their poster images. This raises the
        question of how to composite content with different color spaces and
        dynamic range encodings.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>
        Support for HDR and WCG on the web is important to allow color and
        luminance matching between HDR video content and surrounding or
        overlaid graphic and textual content in web pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some specific goals include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Ensure support for HDR encoded video as a first class citizen on the
          web, including both HLG and PQ, with appropriate rules defined for
          composition of content.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enable support for HDR static images, texual content, and graphics
          rendered via Canvas or SVG.
        </li>
        <li>
          Promote understanding of HDR graphics issues among the web developer
          community.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There are a number of specifications potentially impacted by HDR.
        One of the purposes of this document is to identify all documents that
        are possibly affected, so that we can review them and determine any
        changes needed.

      <h2>Specifying Colors in Web Pages</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>CSS Color Module</h3>
        <p>
          CSS defines several ways of specifying the colors to use in web
          pages, in the CSS Color Module specifications. The current Recommendation is
          Level 3 [[css-color-3]], and its successor, Level 4, is becoming stable
          and starting to be implemented [[css-color-4]].
          The various methods in Level 4 cover WCG but not HDR, and are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>sRGB (Red, Green, Blue), using the <code>rgb()</code> and <code>rgba()</code> functions</li>
          <li>Named colors, from early HTML and X11, e.g., 'aqua', 'black', 'blue', 'fuchsia', etc</li>
          <li>HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness), using the <code>hsl()</code> and <code>hsla()</code> functions</li>
          <li>(*) HWB (Hue, Whiteness, Blackness), using the <code>hwb()</code> function</li>
          <li>(*) Lab and LCH (Lightness, Chroma, Hue), using the <code>lab()</code> and <code>lch()</code> functions</li>
          <li>(*) Profiled, device-dependent colors:
            <ul>
              <li>predefined colorspaces: <code>display-p3</code>, <code>a98-rgb</code> (compatible with Adobe® RGB (1998)), <code>prophoto-rgb</code>, <code>rec-2020</code> </li>
              <li>calibrated colorspaces, using <code>@profile</code> to link to an ICC profile.
              This is not limited to RGB: <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-4/#cal-cmyk">CMYK and wide-gamut print spaces</a> are also covered.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Items marked (*) are new in Level 4. <code>rgb()</code>,
          <code>named colors</code>, <code>HSL</code> and <code>HWB</code>
          all resolve to sRGB. The others are WCG.
          To date, all of these are SDR colorspaces.</p>
        <p>
          Section 12 in [[css-color-4]] is titled "Working Color Space", and
          currently empty. It is intended to cover compositing multiple colorspaces.
          There is as yet no consensus on whether this should be per-document or a per-element property;
          nor on whether a single value is appropriate for all operations.
          We need to define how should compositing work, if
          there is HLG, PQ, and SDR content present. The [[hdr-chrome]]
          discussion document provides useful input. This will require defining
          where black, media/paper white, and peak whites (full-screen and small-area hilights)
          map in the various spaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          The draft CSS Color Module Level 4 [[css-color-4]],
          adds WCG support. Rec. 2020 is covered, but only for SDR.
          The range of CIE Lightness (in Lab and LCH)
          is not constrained to 100,
          and a figure of 400 …</p></section></section></div>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>In the classical world, it is quite common that we could make an exactly the same copy of something. However, in the quantum world, the laws of physics impose a severe restriction on copying: It is impossible to make a perfect copy of an unknown state.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss the No-Cloning Theorem in quantum theory.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="kronecker-product-inverse-transpose-property">Kronecker Product Inverse-Transpose Property</h4>

<p>Conjugate transposition are distributive over the Kronecker product:</p><p>

\[(A \otimes B)^{\dagger} =  A^{\dagger} \otimes B^{\dagger}\]

\[\begin{align}
(A \otimes B)^{\dagger} &amp;= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    A_{0,0}B &amp; A_{0,1}B &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{0,n-1}B \\
    A_{1,0}B &amp; A_{1,1}B &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{1,n-1}B \\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
    A_{m-1,0}B &amp; A_{m-1,1}B &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{m-1,n-1}B \\
\end{bmatrix}^{\dagger} 
\nonumber\\
&amp;= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    (A_{0,0}B)^{\dagger} &amp; (A_{1,0}B)^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; (A_{m-1,0}B)^{\dagger} \\
    (A_{0,1}B)^{\dagger} &amp; (A_{1,1}B)^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; (A_{m-1,1}B)^{\dagger} \\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
    (A_{0,n-1}B)^{\dagger} &amp; (A_{1,n-1}B)^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; (A_{m-1,n-1}B)^{\dagger} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\nonumber\\
&amp;= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    \overline{A_{0,0}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \overline{A_{1,0}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; \overline{A_{m-1,0}}B^{\dagger} \\
    \overline{A_{0,1}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \overline{A_{1,1}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; \overline{A_{m-1,1}}B^{\dagger} \\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
    \overline{A_{0,n-1}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \overline{A_{1,n-1}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; \overline{A_{m-1,n-1}}B^{\dagger} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\nonumber\\
&amp;= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    A_{0,0}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; A_{0,1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{0, m-1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} \\
    A_{1,0}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; A_{1,1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{1, m-1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} \\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
    A_{n-1,0}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; A_{n-1,1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{n-1,m-1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\nonumber\\
&amp;=
A^{\dagger} \otimes B^{\dagger} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="kronecker-product-mixed-product-property">Kronecker Product Mixed-Product Property</h4>

<p>Let $A \in \mathbb{C}^{m \times n}$, $B \in \mathbb{C}^{r \times s}$, $C \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times p}$, and $D \in \mathbb{C}^{s \times t}$, then</p><p>

\[(A \otimes B)(C \otimes D) = (AC) \otimes (BD)\]

</p><p>This has been proved in <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Kronecker-Product-In-Circuits/">Kronecker Product In Circuits</a>.</p>

<h4 id="inner-product-expansion-property">Inner Product Expansion Property</h4>

<p>Suppose $|x\rangle$ is any unit vector whose $|x|^2 = \langle x | x \rangle = 1$. We have $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle = (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |) (| x \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle)$</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
(\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |) (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle) &amp;= (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle)^{\dagger} (|\phi\rangle \otimes |x\rangle) \\
&amp;= (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} \otimes | x \rangle^{\dagger}) (|\phi\rangle \otimes |x\rangle) \\
&amp;= (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger}|\phi\rangle) \otimes (| x \rangle^{\dagger}|x\rangle) \\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \otimes \langle x | x \rangle\\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \otimes 1\\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle\\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="unitary-matrix-preserves-inner-product">Unitary Matrix Preserves Inner Product</h4>

<p>Given two complex vectors $x$ and $y$, multiplication by unitary matrix $U$ preserves their inner product.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle Ux, Uy \rangle &amp;= \langle x, y \rangle
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Using the definition of inner product,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle Ux, Uy \rangle &amp;= (Uy)^{\dagger} (Ux) \\
&amp;= y^{\dagger}U^{\dagger} U x \\
&amp;= y^{\dagger}(U^{\dagger} U) x \\
&amp;= y^{\dagger} I x \\
&amp;= y^{\dagger} x \\
&amp;= \langle x, y \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h3 id="no-cloning-theorem">No-Cloning Theorem</h3>

<p>In quantum mechanics, copy, as it is the same to other quantum operators except measurement operators, is an reversible and linear operator.</p>



<p>Given any unknown normalized quantum state $| \phi \rangle$, and the copy operator $U$, we are supposed to have the following mathematical expression if we are going to copy the quantum state $| \phi \rangle$ to another system whose quantum state is $|x \rangle$ before copy.</p><p>

\[| \phi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle \xrightarrow[]{U} | \phi \rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle\]

</p><p>We would like to write this transformation into equation.</p><p>

\[U (| \phi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = | \phi \rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle\]

</p><p>Without loss of generality, we could have another state $| \psi \rangle$ that is applied to the copy operator.</p><p>

\[U (| \psi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = | \psi \rangle \otimes |\psi\rangle\]

</p><p>Note that for $| \psi \rangle$ we also used $|x\rangle$ which $| \phi \rangle$ is using, meaning that before copy, the â€œvacantâ€� system is always the same. This is something we could guarantee.</p>



<p>We examine the inner product of $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ using the copy property and all the properties in the prerequisite section.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle \phi | \psi \rangle &amp;= (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |) (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle) \\
&amp;= \big(U (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |)\big) \big(U (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle)\big) \\
&amp;= (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle \phi |) (| \psi \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| \psi \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle)^{\dagger} (| \phi \rangle \otimes | \phi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} \otimes | \psi \rangle^{\dagger}) (| \phi \rangle \otimes | \phi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} | \phi \rangle ) \otimes (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} | \phi \rangle ) \\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \otimes \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Because $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle$ is scalar, we further have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle \phi | \psi \rangle &amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \otimes \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Solving the above equation, we have $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle = 0$ or $1$.</p>



<p>Because $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ could be any arbitrary unknown states, $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle = 0$ or $1$ could never be satisfied.</p>



<p>Therefore, there is no general quantum copy operator that makes copy of any unknown state.</p>

<h3 id="more-restrict-no-cloning-theorem">More Restrict No-Cloning Theorem</h3>

<p>In quantum theory, $| \phi \rangle$ and $c | \phi \rangle$, where $c$ is a non-zero complex number, represent the same physical state. If $|c \phi|^2 = 1$, then $| \phi \rangle$ and $c | \phi \rangle$ only have phase difference.</p>



<p>For example, $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ have exactly the same probability of collapsing to $| 0 \rangle$ and $| 1 \rangle$. However, $| \phi \rangle$ has phase $\varphi_1$ while $| \psi \rangle$ has phase $\varphi_2$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
| \phi \rangle &amp;= \cos \frac{\theta}{2} | 0 \rangle + e^{i\varphi_1} \sin \frac{\theta}{2} | 1 \rangle \\
| \psi \rangle &amp;= \cos \frac{\theta}{2} | 0 \rangle + e^{i\varphi_2} \sin \frac{\theta}{2} | 1 \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>More restrict No-Cloning Theorem states that â€œcopyingâ€� any unknown state while abandoning the phase is not possible either.</p>



<p>Suppose we have such â€œcopyâ€� operator, the mathematical expression for â€œcopyâ€� will be as follows.</p><p>

\[U (| \phi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = e^{\varphi} | \phi \rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle\\
U (| \psi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = e^{\varphi^{\prime}} | \psi \rangle \otimes |\psi\rangle\]

</p><p>Similarly, we have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle \phi | \psi \rangle &amp;= e^{\varphi} e^{\varphi^{\prime}}\langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2 \\
&amp;= e^{\varphi + \varphi^{\prime}} \langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>The norm of the two sides should be equivalent.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle| &amp;= |e^{\varphi + \varphi^{\prime}} \langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2| \\
&amp;= |e^{\varphi + \varphi^{\prime}}| |\langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2| \\
&amp;= 1 |\langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2| \\
&amp;= |\langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2| \\
&amp;= |\langle \phi | \psi \rangle |^2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Solving the above equation, we have $|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle | = 0$ or $1$.</p>



<p>Because $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ could be any arbitrary unknown states, $|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle | = 0$ or $1$ could never be satisfied.</p>



<p>Therefore, there is no general quantum â€œcopyâ€� operator that makes â€œcopyâ€� of any unknown state that has lost the phase information.</p>

<h3 id="transportation">Transportation</h3>

<p>Since it is not possible to do copy in quantum world, how about transportation?</p>



<p>Concretely, given any unknown normalized quantum state $| \phi \rangle$, and the transportation operator $U$, we are supposed to have the following mathematical expression if we are going to transport the quantum state $| \phi \rangle$ to another system whose quantum state is $|x \rangle$ before transportation.</p><p>

\[U(| \phi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = | x \rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle\]

</p><p>Note that although it is called transportation, it is more like a switch, where the two system states, one unknown and one known, got switched.</p>



<p>Without loss of generality, we could have another state $| \psi \rangle$ that is applied to the transportation operator.</p><p>

\[U(| \psi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = | x \rangle \otimes |\psi\rangle\]

</p><p>Similarly, we compute the inner product of $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle \phi | \psi \rangle &amp;= (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |) (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle) \\
&amp;= \big(U (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |)\big) \big(U (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle)\big) \\
&amp;= (\langle x | \otimes \langle \phi |) (| x \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| x \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle)^{\dagger} (| x \rangle \otimes | \phi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| x \rangle^{\dagger} \otimes | \psi \rangle^{\dagger}) (| x \rangle \otimes | \phi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| x \rangle^{\dagger} | x \rangle ) \otimes (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} | \phi \rangle ) \\
&amp;= \langle x | x \rangle \otimes \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
&amp;= 1 \otimes \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

      <p>C and C++ as languages have a few things separating them from each other, mostly in their minute details and, occasionally, larger feature sets like designated initializers. But there is a disturbingly high amount of C++ that can simply do C’s job far better than C<!--more-->, including when it comes to solving some of the biggest problems facing the evolution of C and C++.</p>

<p>Let’s take a contemporary problem plaguing both C and C++, affecting everyone from standard library maintainers to project developers, that has been going on for the last 20 or so years: <code>intmax_t</code>.</p>



<p>The concept behind <code>intmax_t</code> is simple enough: it is the largest integer type that your implementation and its standard library support in conjunction. Here is a few things <code>intmax_t</code> controls inside the implementation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>numeric literals are preprocessed according to what <code>intmax_t</code> can handle (C and C++);</li>
  <li>it is the maximum number of bits that can be printed portably, e.g. with <code>printf("%j", (intmax_t)value)</code> (C and C++);</li>
  <li><code>intmax_t</code> is the largest type for which <code>std::numeric_limits</code> applies, including most types up to and including that type (C++ only);</li>
  <li><code>intmax_t</code> underpins <code>std::chrono</code>’s casts and similar (e.g. no information is lost during conversions out of and into the system) (C++ only);</li>
  <li>and, there are a set of integer operations provided by the standard library (like absolute value and quotient / remainder operations) that can be done with the maximum bit precision available to the implementation (C and C++).</li>
</ul>

<p>These properties forge the basis of <code>intmax_t</code>’s purpose. Lossless storage, pass-through operations, and more can all be achieved by relying on this implicit contract of the type. Since it is a type definition, the “real” integer type underneath it can be swapped out and people relying on it can be upgraded seamlessly!</p>



<p>We cannot upgrade seamlessly.</p>

<p>C has a much higher commitment to not breaking old code and keeping “developers close to the machine”. What this actually translates to for most Application Binary Interfaces is very simplistic “name mangling” schemes (i.e., none), <a href="https://twitter.com/__phantomderp/status/1329960075096694790">weak linkers</a>, and other shenanigans. The end result is that we expose C developers to platform details that become invisible dependencies for their code that must be preserved at all costs. For example, let’s take a C Standard function that uses <code>intmax_t</code>, <code>imaxabs</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>intmax_t</span> <span>imaxabs</span><span>(</span><span>intmax_t</span> <span>j</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and, let’s try to figure out how we can upgrade someone off of this usage without breaking their code too badly. We will try fixing this in both C and C++.</p>



<p>Taking <code>intmax_t</code>, let’s do a no-brainer usage case: calling a function with <code>intmax_t</code> input and return types. The syntax and usage ends up looking like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include &lt;inttypes.h&gt;
</span>
<span>int</span> <span>main</span> <span>()</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>intmax_t</span> <span>original</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>intmax_t</span><span>)</span><span>-</span><span>2</span><span>;</span>
	<span>intmax_t</span> <span>val</span> <span>=</span> <span>imaxabs</span><span>(</span><span>original</span><span>);</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span><span>)</span><span>val</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Easy enough! But, there’s also a hidden dependency here, based on how the code is compiled. While many people compile their C standard library as a static library and only generate final binary code for what they use as to have a “self-contained” binary, the vast majority of the shared ecosystem depends on shared libraries/dynamically linked libraries for the standard. This means that when a program is milled through an operating system at program startup, the “loader” runs off to find the symbol <code>imaxabs</code> inside some system library (e.g., <code>/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.27.so</code> for an “amd64” system). Harmless enough, right? Well, it turns out to be a bit of a problem in practice, because the name <code>imaxabs</code> is all that’s used in C to figure out what subroutine to talk with in some shared library,</p>

<p>and that name is completely inadequate.</p>

<p>Consider the following scenario:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The glibc maintainers decide they’re going to change from <code>long long</code> as their <code>intmax_t</code> and move to <code>__int256_t</code> for most platforms, because most platforms support it and they have a lot of customers asking for it.</li>
  <li>They upgrade the <code>libc</code> to its next version for various Linux distribution, and everyone links against it when they look for the default <code>libc</code>.</li>
  <li>You have an application. Your code was not changed or updated, so it was not recompiled. It calls <code>imaxabs</code>. The argument it passes is a <code>long long</code>, because that was the type at the time you last compiled and shipped your software.</li>
  <li>The <code>imaxabs</code> used to lookup the function to call finds the version that takes a <code>__int256_t</code> in the new <code>libc</code>.</li>
  <li>Different registers are used to pass and return the function value than expected by the <code>imaxabs</code> function call in the <code>libc</code> binary, because your application is in <code>long long</code> mode but glibc expects a <code>__int256_t</code>.</li>
  <li>All hell breaks loose.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is one of the manifestations of what is called an “Application Binary Interface (ABI) Break”. ABI Breaks are generally undetectable, silent breaks that occur within the runtime of a program that completely destroy any dependency your program has on that functionality for correctness. It typically happens when a subtle detail – the registers used to negotiate a large integral value between a shared library and its application, the amount of padding a structure might have on a certain build, the ordering and layout of class members, the interpretation of bits even if the layout or passing convention of a type never changes, and even more – changes.</p>

<h2 id="but-c-is-abi-stable">“But C Is ABI-Stable?!”</h2>

<p>Not necessarily. C is a simple language, and it both sells itself on and prides itself as such. So much so, that it’s even part of the <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2021.htm">language’s rolling charter</a>. There’s barely any name mangling because there’s no overloading. If you want “virtual functions” you need to hand-craft your virtual table structure and initialize it yourself. There’s barely any lookup or entity negotiation: what you write – <a href="https://twitter.com/thingskatedid/status/1328918322507706368">however scary or cursed</a> – is what you get, in a general sense. (No, it’s not “portable assembly”. Compilers tear C code apart and make it far more efficient than the code people stuff into it. It’s not even a direct model of the machine anymore: just an abstract one.)</p>

<p>Still, sometimes even C can’t get away from it. The function <code>imaxabs</code> relates to exactly one entity that, for historical reasons, was pinned to a function taking and returning a <code>long long</code>. Upgrading it means dealing with this schism between what the user expects (<code>intmax_t</code> that got upgraded and can print <code>__int128_t</code>/<code>__int256_t</code>) with old, non-recompiled code that maintains the old invariant (<code>long long</code>, a 64-bit number).</p>



<p>Okay, so symbols can be repurposed between library versions that lead to ABI breaks. What are the ways to defend against such a world, in C?</p>

<h2 id="macros">Macros?</h2>

<p>Macros! Object-like macros are fun. You could do something like this…</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#define imaxabs __glibc228_imaxabs
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>… as a way to provide the <code>imaxabs</code> function. It is a bit like artisanal, hand-crafted, free-range, and organic ABI versioning (or, as I have affectionately come to call it: personal masochism to make up for language failures). This mostly works, until… it doesn’t!</p>

<h3 id="714">§7.1.4</h3>

<p>This is the “ABI Breaks Guaranteed” section in the C Standard. It’s real name is “§7.1.4 Use of library functions”. Reproduced below is the relevant piece that condemns us, emphasis mine:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any function declared in a header may be additionally implemented as a function-like macro defined in the header, so if a library function is declared explicitly when its header is included, one of the techniques shown below can be used to ensure the declaration is not affected by such a macro. <strong>Any macro definition of a function can be suppressed locally by enclosing the name of the function in parentheses</strong>, because the name is then not followed by the left parenthesis that indicates expansion of a macro function name. For the same syntactic reason, it is permitted to take the address of a library function even if it is also defined as a macro. <strong>The use of <code>#undef</code> to remove any macro definition will also ensure that an actual function is referred to</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only can a user suppress a function-like macro invocation by using the same trick used on <code>&lt;windows.h&gt;</code> like <code>(max)(value0, value1)</code>, but the C Standard Library permits them to also undefine function names:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// implementer code: inttypes.h</span>
<span>#define imaxabs __glibc228_imaxabs
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// user code: main.c</span>
<span>#include &lt;inttypes.h&gt;
</span>
<span>#undef imaxabs // awh geez
</span>
<span>int</span> <span>main</span> <span>()</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>intmax_t</span> <span>val</span> <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>;</span>
	<span>intmax_t</span> <span>absval</span> <span>=</span> <span>imaxabs</span><span>(</span><span>val</span><span>);</span> <span>// awH GEEZ</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span><span>)</span><span>absval</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Mmm……</p>

<h3 id="implementation-specific-strategies">Implementation-specific strategies</h3>

<p>Alright, the C Standard basically loads a double barrel and brings our only standardized mitigation strategy out back behind the barn. What’s left? Well, implementation-specific insanity, that’s what:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>extern</span>
<span>intmax_t</span>
<span>__glibc228_imaxabs</span><span>(</span><span>intmax_t</span><span>);</span>

<span>__attribute</span><span>((</span><span>symbol</span><span>(</span><span>__MANGLE</span><span>(</span><span>__glibc228_imaxabs</span><span>))))</span>
<span>extern</span>
<span>intmax_t</span>
<span>imaxabs</span><span>(</span><span>intmax_t</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is pseudo-code. But, wouldn’t you believe it, some implementations actually do things very similar to this to get around these problems! The things they do are far more involved, like actually dropping down to the level of the linker and creating symbol maps and other exceedingly painful workarounds. The sed scripts and the awk scripts and the bash starts coming out, people are doing lots of text processing to get symbol names and match them to versioned symbol names…</p>

<p>It’s a mess.</p>

<p>Still, given the mess, it does save us from the problem. In C code you get to use “the real name” <code>imaxabs</code> as Our Lord and Savior intended, the binary gets linked to <code>___glibc228_imaxabs</code>, and everyone’s happy. There’s only one problem with this kind of fix…</p>

<p>It’s Quality of Implementation (QoI).</p>

<p>QoI is great for the pure, theoretical standard. We get to write sexy narratives in the C standard and call them “Recommended Practice”, with little footnotes furtively implying a more wonderful world while waggling our eyebrows seductively at hot, young developers in our area. Just come along, it’s going to be so great, we’re going have soooooo much fun, just go with that lovely little implementation right over there, you’re making such fine progress, enjoy yourself and come back soon my …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Being the internet-dabbling dilettante that I am, I often gaze longingly at the front page of Hacker News, wondering when my own content will reach it and <del>waste</del> merit the time of others. But alas, my time is precious, and I can't spend all day refreshing the browser to see when I've achieved my goal. Let's set something up to do that for me.</p>
<p><strong><em>Mission:</em></strong> Write a script that scans the front page of HN for the presence of this blog post. If we detect it, update this blog post, including the time from when it reached the front page. Run the script(s) periodically for a day before accepting inevitable defeat.</p>

<h2><a href="#how-is-this-going-to-work">How is this going to work?</a></h2>
<p>Nothing fancy here - let's approach each of these steps individually before gluing them together:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a <code>go</code> script that scrapes the front page of HN for our post.</li>
<li>Create a <code>bash</code> script that calls the <code>go</code> script (and can tell whether it found our post or failed).</li>
<li>Create a periodically running job that runs the <code>bash</code> script.</li>
<li>
<p>Add conditional behaviors to the <code>bash</code> script:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the <code>go</code> script succeeds in finding our post: modify our post markdown (succeeded!), create a <code>git</code> commit, and push to <code>github</code> to trigger a deploy. Clear the job!</li>
<li>If the <code>go</code> script fails (and we're out of time): modify our post (failed), create a <code>git</code> commit, and push to <code>github</code> to trigger a deploy. Clear the job!</li>
<li>If the <code>go</code> script fails (and we have time left): log some information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deploy the blog post, submit it to HN, and start the script!</li>
<li>Keep my computer awake and return in 24 hours.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can test the little pieces by handing the <code>go</code> script existing or fictional targets to search for on the front page of HN.</p>
<p>Sweet! Nothing to it but to do it. A few things to keep in mind before we start:</p>
<h4>High Level Caveats</h4>
<ol>
<li>I'm going to use <code>launchd</code> as my job scheduler because I'm working on a Mac. If you're on Linux, <span id="aside-os-scheduler" aside-content="Swapping in your own OS-specific scheduler is an exercise left to the reader! systemd is probably a reasonable place to start. 😇">you're going to need to use something else.<sup><a href="#aside-os-scheduler-note">1</a></sup></span></li>
<li>We will consider the "front page" to be anything in the top 30, since that's what loads on desktop before paginating. I may end up keeping track of "peak height reached", to salve my bruised ego - TBD.</li>
<li>We're going to run the script every 10 minutes for a day and then give up. Judging from the front page of HN <em>at this moment</em>, it looks like nothing is up there that's more than 24 hours old. If we don't reach the front page by then, we're fine with that.</li>
<li>We're going to write the results from running the script to a log file we can check later.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although there are practical applications of periodically scraping websites and doing things with the data, this is obviously not one of them. Let's get to it.</p>

<h2><a href="#scraping-hacker-news">Scraping Hacker News</a></h2>
<p>Here's what I'm envisioning running the <code>go</code> script will look like:</p>

<h2><a href="#spinning-up-a-periodic-job">Spinning up a periodic job</a></h2>
<p>Half the fun of this is getting my computer to check regularly for me instead of pounding <code>cmd + r</code>. I initially looked into using <code>cron</code> and <code>crontab</code>, and saw the following when I ran <code>man crontab</code>:</p>
<div><p>...(Darwin note: Although cron(8) and crontab(5) are officially supported under Darwin, their functionality has been absorbed into launchd(8), which provides a more flexible way of automatically executing commands.  See launchctl(1) for more information.)</p></div>
<p>I figure that this is a quiet way of saying "might be deprecated soon" so I'm going to use the more contemporary set of tools (<code>launchd</code>) for our script.</p>
<p>How can we create a <code>launchd</code> job? I feel like I've done this in a past life, but I followed <a href="https://medium.com/@chetcorcos/a-simple-launchd-tutorial-9fecfcf2dbb3">this useful walkthrough</a> by <a href="https://medium.com/@chetcorcos">Chet Corcos</a> to refresh my memory. For <a href="https://www.launchd.info/">reference</a>:</p>
<div><p>(launchd is) a unified, open-source service management framework for starting, stopping and managing daemons, applications, processes, and scripts.</p></div>
<p>...and <code>launchctl</code> is the command line tool we can use to start and stop those processes. We're basically going to create an <code>XML</code> file describing when to run our job and how frequently, and add it to the set of jobs that my computer is already running periodically using <code>launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/foo</code>. Unsurprisingly, we can unload the script with <code>launchctl unload ...</code>, referencing the same filepath.</p>
<p>Here's what my basic job looks like (<code>~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.gc.navel.plist</code>):</p>

<p>Simple enough - the <code>XML</code> file is a set of key value pairs that define a script to run (<code>ProgramArguments</code>), a frequency to run at (<code>StartInterval</code>, measured in seconds), and some output paths and environment information (<code>WorkingDirectory</code>, <code>EnvironmentVariables</code>, etc.). Note that right now we've configured the job to run every 10 minutes, which we may want to tweak for debugging later. Also notice that the <span id="aside-directory-structure" aside-content="Obviously your directory structure might look completely different, so do what makes sense if you're following along at home.">working directory doesn't match<sup><a href="#aside-directory-structure-note">3</a></sup></span> the output paths I've referenced, and that I've moved the script to a separate directory too. I don't really want this code living in the repo for my blog, even though that's where we want to run the script (to possibly modify the markdown post and push with <code>git</code>).</p>
<div data-language="shell-session"><pre><code><span><span>$</span> <span><span>cd</span> ~/home</span></span>

<p>Nice. We've enabled <code>RunAtLoad</code>, so the script will run immediately. Let's see that everything still "works" by loading the job and checking <code>out.log</code> and <code>err.log</code>:</p>
<div data-language="shell-session"><pre><code><span><span>$</span> <span>launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.gc.navel.plist</span></span>
<span><span>$</span> <span><span>cd</span> ~/home/navel</span></span>
<span><span>$</span> <span><span>cat</span> out.log</span></span>
<span>Running navel.sh

</span><span><span>$</span> <span><span>cat</span> err.log</span></span>
<span>/Users/scott/home/navel/navel.sh: line 6: go: command not found
/Users/scott/home/navel/navel.sh: line 6: go: command not found</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Aha - it doesn't look like the job knows how to run <code>go</code> commands. We need to make sure that the <code>&lt;EnvironmentVariables/&gt;</code> <code>ENV</code> value includes our <code>go</code> binary. Easy enough to fix:</p>
<div data-language="shell-session"><pre><code><span><span>$</span> <span><span>which</span> go</span></span>
<span>/Users/local/go/bin/go</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So lets add <em>the directory where</em> <code>go</code> <em>is located</em> (<code>/Users/local/go/bin</code>) to the end of our set of directories to look for executables (<code>PATH</code>) in the <code>plist</code> file:</p>
<div data-language="xml"><pre><code>...
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>key</span><span>&gt;</span></span>EnvironmentVariables<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>key</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>key</span><span>&gt;</span></span>PATH<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>key</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

<p>Once more, with feeling:</p>
<div data-language="shell-session"><pre><code><span><span>$</span> <span>launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.gc.navel.plist</span></span>

<p>It takes a few seconds on my machine to fetch the results, we're waiting a bit with <code>sleep</code> before we check for results. But it worked! So let's add some slightly more complex behaviors based on the result of the script running.</p>

You will then pay back your investors over time via an income share agreement.</p><h3>About <strong>Income Share Agreements</strong></h3><p>An Income Share Agreement (ISA) allows for individuals to seek funding without requiring their investors to take a massive risk.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br>We found that many Friends and Family funding rounds and Pre-Seed funding rounds by startup founders happen when the business is still incredibly risky. With an incredibly high chance of failure, it is almost always a bad investment to make. At these early stages of a venture, the investors are usually investing based on their confidence in the founder more than any other factor. With that in mind, we believe it makes sense to provide founders with an investment vehicle that matches investors’ thought processes. That is where Income Share Agreements (ISAs) come into play. An ISA allows for investors to invest in a founder, with the potential to profit from the founder’s success. This means that an investor could profit if the founder is successful with their second or even third venture, instead of the investor’s money completely riding on the founder’s first venture.&nbsp;<br>‍<br>While this investment vehicle is not wiped out when an entity goes out of business, it also does not put a founder into long-term debt. There is no guarantee that a founder will pay back the entire amount of the initial investment, making the investment potentially more risky than a standard loan. But, since the investment does not go away with an entity, the investment is potentially less risky than an equity investment.<br>‍<br>We believe that ISAs are most useful when a startup founder needs capital to build their Minimum Viable Product, which is typically where a Friends and Family round happens.&nbsp;<br>‍<br>We also believe that ISAs are great alternatives to loans and are versatile to fit many different applications. From our research and customer development initiatives, we have found people who want to utilize ISAs for startup funding, working capital as a freelancer, student financing, debt refinancing or consolidation, and many other applications.&nbsp;</p><h2>ISA Examples</h2><p><strong>Basic Terms of an ISA</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Dollar amount of investment</p></li><li><p>Percentage of income each year</p></li><li><p>Max duration of income sharing</p></li><li><p>Capped pay-back amount</p></li></ul><p><strong>Example of an ISA and two scenarios</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>You borrow $100k</p></li><li><p>Terms are 10% of income for 10 years, 3x pay-back cap</p></li></ul><p><em>Scenario 1</em></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>You start making money from your business 2 years after getting funded through Invest In Me’s ISA.</p></li><li><p>You make $100k/yr for the next 5 years and then sell your business, making $10m from the sale.</p></li><li><p>You have paid back $50k from your annual income and $250k from the sale of your business, hitting the 3x cap on the ISA.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p><em>Scenario 2</em></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>You work on your business for 3 years, making no money. Your business fails and you decide to move on and get a job.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>You make $60k/yr for the next 10 years. (Duration of the ISA is deferred while you were starting out and not earning anything.)</p></li><li><p>You have paid back $60k from your annual income and the ISA ends, leaving you debt-free.</p></li></ul><p>‍</p><p><strong>Other terms an ISA could contain</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Delay start of “duration” until first annual income over $40k happens</p></li><li><p>Years of under $40k income are exempt and deferred, extending the “duration”</p></li><li><p>Protections against stashing income in an S-corp to avoid paying on an ISA</p></li><li><p>Protections against taking a minimal income in order to “ride out” the term of the ISA before taking dividends from your business or selling it for a profit</p></li><li><p>No prepayment penalty, but also no prepayment discount on the capped pay-back.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Audit rights of personal tax returns, pay stubs, and bank statements.</p></li></ul><h2>Why are we doing this?? 🤯</h2><div><p>Invest In Me is currently providing a way for startup founders to raise capital through an easier means. Our future will add to this and continue on our mission to increase people's access to capital.</p><p>Our intentions are to build a crowd-lending platform to allow for anyone to raise capital from the crowd via income share agreements.

In fairness, I feel like Xooglers get a bad rap. Since in my limited experience, I have noticed this to be just as true for folks from any other tech company - AirBnb, Uber, Stripe, or similar.</p><p>It’s not uncommon for humans to draw comparisons or use past learning to inform a future decision. It’s something I faced too after my time at Intercom. Then every time, I began a sentence with “At my place…” I mentally put a dollar in a jar while feeling a rush of cringe through my body. On the one hand, I felt horrible for not bringing a rational, unbiased mind to a conversation. On the other hand, I considered the comparison a useful thought experiment to tease out the details.</p><p>Drawing from a past experience, naming a company, technology, or referencing a white paper are also some ways of bringing credibility to the table while sharing an honest opinion. In fairness, I looked back to all kinds of experiences, especially the ones with lessons learnt.</p><p>The problem to avoid here is not to get into a rut of doing something just because that’s how X company or team operated in the past. Or because it makes the decision process more comfortable, so you patch the problem at hand and move on to the next things.</p><p>You may notice that often what is also being proposed is a solution that more or less addresses the problem. Still, folks get too involved in solutionizing, so they miss the sight of the original problem. Going back to first principles is a nice way to reset the ground. Asking questions like “Does this address the problem, we are facing here today?” or “What problem is it trying to solve?” can be helpful.</p><p>One thing to remember is not giving yourself a hard time. Its also why companies hire people with past experiences so you can bring that knowledge and expertise to help solve current problems.</p><p>A smart person once said, “The important thing is not to stop questioning”. And I think that’s what matters at the end of the day is to be able to innovate while being fair.</p></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>December 05, 2020</p></header><p>At scale, any failure that can happen will eventually happen. Hardware failures, software crashes, memory leaks - you name it. The more components you have, the more failures you will experience.</p><p>This nasty behavior is caused by <em>cruel math</em> - given an operation that has a certain probability of failing, as the total number of operations performed increases, so does the total number of failures. In other words, as you scale out your application to handle more load, the more failures it will experience.</p><p>To protect your application against failures, you first need to know what can go wrong. Assuming you are using a cloud provider and not maintaning your own datacenter, the most common failures you will encounter are caused by single points of failure, the network being unreliable, slow processes, and unexpected load.</p><h2 id="single-point-of-failure"><a href="#single-point-of-failure" aria-label="single point of failure permalink"></a>Single Point of Failure</h2><p>A single point of failure is the most glaring cause of failure in a distributed system - it’s that one component that when it fails brings down the entire system with it. In practice, distributed systems can have multiple single points of failure.</p><p>A service that to start up needs to read its configuration from a non-replicated database is an example of a single point of failure - if the database isn’t reachable, the service won’t be able to start. </p><p>A more subtle example is a service that exposes a HTTP API on top of TLS and uses a certificate that needs to be manually renewed. If the certificate isn’t renewed by the time it expires, then most clients trying to connect to it wouldn’t be able to open a connection with the service. </p><p>Single points of failure should be identified when the system is architected before they can cause any harm. The best way to detect them is to examine every component of the system and ask what would happen if that component were to fail. Some single points of failure can be architected away, e.g., by introducing redundancy, while others can’t. In that case, the only option left is to minimize the blast radius.</p><h2 id="unreliable-network"><a href="#unreliable-network" aria-label="unreliable network permalink"></a>Unreliable Network</h2><p>When a client make a remote network call, it sends a request to a server and expects to receive a response from it a while later. In the best case, the client receives a response shortly after sending the request. But what if the client waits and waits and still doesn’t get a response? </p><p>In that case, the client doesn’t know whether a response will eventually arrive or not. At that point it has only two options, it can either continue to wait, or fail the request with an exception or an error.</p><p>Slow network calls are the <a href="https://robertovitillo.com/default-timeouts/">silent killers</a> of distributed systems. Because the client doesn’t know whether the response is on its way or not, it can spend a long time waiting before giving up, if it gives up at all. The wait can in turn cause degradations that are extremely hard to debug. </p><h2 id="slow-processes"><a href="#slow-processes" aria-label="slow processes permalink"></a>Slow Processes</h2><p>From an observer’s point of view, a very slow process is not very different from one that isn’t running at all - neither can perform useful work. Resource leaks are one of the most common causes of slow processes.</p><p>Memory leaks are arguably the most well-known source of leaks. A memory leak manifests itself with a steady increase in memory consumption over time. Run-times with garbage collection don’t help much either - if a reference to an object that isn’t longer needed is kept somewhere, the object won’t be deleted by the garbage collector. </p><p>A memory leak keeps consuming memory until there is no more of it, at which point the operating system starts swapping memory pages to the disk constantly, all the while the garbage collector kicks in more frequently trying its best to release any shred of memory. The constant paging and the garbage collector eating up CPU cycles make the process slower. Eventually, when there is no more physical memory, and there is no more space in the swap file, the process won’t be able to allocate more memory, and most operations will fail.</p><p>Memory is just one of the many resources that can leak. For example, if you are using a thread pool, you can lose a thread when it blocks on a synchronous call that never returns. If a thread makes a synchronous, and blocking, HTTP call <a href="https://robertovitillo.com/default-timeouts/">without setting a timeout</a>, and the call never returns, the thread won’t be returned to the pool. Since the pool has a fixed size and keeps losing threads, the pool will eventually run out of threads. </p><p>You might think that making <em>asynchronous</em> calls, rather than a synchronous ones, would mitigate the problem in the previous case. But, modern HTTP clients use socket pools to avoid recreating TCP connections and pay a <a href="https://robertovitillo.com/what-every-developer-should-know-about-tcp/">hefty performance fee</a>. If a request is made without a timeout, the connection is never returned to the pool. As the pool has a limited size, eventually there won’t be any connections left to communicate with the host.</p><p>On top of all that, the code you write isn’t the only one accessing memory, threads and sockets. The libraries your application depends on access the same resources, and they can do all kinds of shady things. Without digging into their implementation, assuming it’s open in the first place, you can’t be sure whether they can wreak havoc or not.</p><h2 id="unexpected-load"><a href="#unexpected-load" aria-label="unexpected load permalink"></a>Unexpected Load</h2><p>Every system has a limit to how much load it can withstand without scaling. Depending on how the load increases, you are bound to hit that brick wall sooner or later. But one thing is an organic increase in load, which gives you the time to scale your service out accordingly, and another is a sudden and unexpected spike.</p><p>For example, consider the number of requests received by a service in a period of time. The rate and the type of incoming requests can change over time, and sometimes suddenly, for a variety of reasons:</p><ul><li>The requests might have a seasonality - depending on the hour of the day the service is going to get hit by users in different countries.</li><li>Some requests are much more expensive than others and abuse the system in ways you didn’t really anticipate for, like scrapers slurping in data from your site at super human speed.</li><li>Some requests are malicious - think of DDoS attacks which try to saturate your service’s bandwidth, denying access to the service to legitimate users.</li></ul><h2 id="cascading-failures"><a href="#cascading-failures" aria-label="cascading failures permalink"></a>Cascading Failures</h2><p>You would think that if your system has hundreds of processes, it shouldn’t make much of a difference if a small percentage are slow or unreachable. The thing about faults is that they tend to spread like cancer, propagating from one process to the other until the whole system crumbles to its knees. This effect is also referred to as a <em>cascading failure</em>, which occurs when a portion of an overall system fails, increasing the probability that other portions fail.</p><p>For example, suppose there are multiple clients querying two database replicas A and B, which are behind a load balancer. Each replica is handling about 50 transactions per second.</p><p>{width: 75%}

This feedback loop of doom can repeat several time.</p><p>Cascading failures are very hard to get under control once they have started.

                    <h2>How long does it take to walk 1 mile?</h2>
<p>As both research and actual scientific measurements, an average adult will walk 1 mile in 15 to 18 minutes at moderate to a brisk pace. Or in other words, 3 to 4 miles per hour.</p>
<p>This is a general measure for a healthy adult between 20 and 50 years old, at dry weather, on relatively flat terrain, with no destruction from cars and other environments.</p>
<p>If you are either less healthy or subjected to any of the environmental distractions, your speed, of course, will be lower.</p>
<h2>Average walking speed by age group and gender</h2>
<p>There is little difference between male and female, with males walking on average 2% faster.</p>
<p>The table below shows the speed of walking based on age and gender:</p>
<pre><code>| Age      | Sex    | Meters per second | Miles per hour |
|----------|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| 20 to 29 | Male   | 1.36              | 3.04           |
|          | Female | 1.34              | 3.0            |
| 30 to 39 | Male   | 1.43              | 3.2            |
|          | Female | 1.34              | 3.0            |
| 40 to 49 | Male   | 1.43              | 3.2            |

<h2>Benefits of walking</h2>
<p>There has been a great deal of research that showed that walking brings a huge advantage to humans. To both <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0013916518800798">physical, and mental well being.</a> The benefits are as follows:</p>
<p>Physical:</p>
<ul>
<li>Burning calories. A direct way to reduce and to control your weight.</li>
<li>Lower glucose level and blood sugar levels. <a href="https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/early/2013/06/03/dc13-0084">Research</a> has focused on short walks, where it helped reduce glucose intolerance.</li>
<li><a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/45/12/987?sid=fe62a8c5-430b-4506-b854-20b62e8a5e9e">Help deal with infection and possibly Covid.</a></li>
<li>Help boost immune function.</li>
<li>Give additional energy to do other tasks due to increased efficiency of nutrients absorption and conversion.</li>
<li>Prolonging life. There is a <a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/52/12/761">research that showed</a> evidence of having a relationship between physical activity and overall life expectancy. </li>
<li>Strengthen the heart. Even 20 minutes of daily walking has shown to reduce the risk of stroke by at least 20%.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mental:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es903183r">Improving self esteem</a> by 45%.</li>
<li><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es903183r">Improving mood</a> by 54%.</li>
<li>Additional time on focusing on self-education with educational podcasts and books. <a href="https://digitalcommons.georgiasouthern.edu/nyar_savannah/2020/2020/90/">Research</a> has shown that it leads to better learning of the material, longer retention, better engagement in post-walk discussions, better behaviour and mood, AND improved health literacy.</li>
<li>Improving <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10413200.2020.1815100">goal setting</a> in other areas by targeting non-specific goals which in consequence lead to better results.</li>
<li>Walking helps you get your thoughts in order. Whenever you are alone with yourself, and you are unable to really look at the phone, you are finally able to understand what is happening with yourself with no distractions.</li>
<li>Improve the creative part of the brain. While walking, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-14435-001">research showed</a>, that it is easier to come up with great ideas.</li>
<li>Save money on medications. With the amount of food, we consume and with costly medicine, walking and doing exercises can help you save money and nerves.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Covid and sitting time</h2>
<p>In the world of pandemics and covid, it has been evident that humans are sitting more and more and do less and less exercises. There is a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221133552030214X">great research</a> that shows that 2020 has caused a sharp increase in average sitting time. The data is staggering.</p>
<p><code>Overall, 42.6% of participants reported sitting for &gt; 8 h/day (95% CI: 41.2%–44.0%) and 72.5% (71.2%–73.7%) reported being either sufficiently (150–300 MVPA minutes) or highly active (&gt;300 min).</code></p>
<p>If you want to boost your health and still to be able to keep up with a busy schedule walking or running can be the best idea for spending your free time. In the world where only entertainment inside your house is minimal. If being glued to the screen is no longer an option, than being outside can boost your health and your mental capabilities immensely.</p>

<h2>Tips on how to start walking</h2>
<h3>How to make walking a habit?</h3>
<p>The walk starts with the first step. It would be best if you did not put huge goals onto yourself. Start somewhere small, then later you can always adjust based on how you feel.</p>
<p>Start by putting on clothes(plus a mask) and go outside. Going back to your apartment would feel bad at that point.</p>
<p>Next, you should walk around your building or up and down the street.</p>
<p>Next, you walk around the block and later you can finally go for huge walks that can be a couple of hours long.</p>
<p>Don’t try to start at the last step that would only make you quit before you get the full benefit of the habit.</p>
<p>Peg your walking habit to something else. If you go for a coffee every morning, go to a coffee house that is further away. If you are usually riding a tube to work, start the journey at the stop further away from you</p>
<h3>Identify as a walker</h3>
<p>If you would like to start walking you need to think of <strong>how do you become a walker.</strong></p>
<p>You need to make sure you identify as someone who goes on walks, then keeping up with the habit will be much easier.</p>
<p>Next time someone asks you, whatever you do any exercises or what you love doing with your free time, you need to want to say that you love walking. At that point, you will be able to keep on walking and improving your health immensely.</p>
<h2>How much walking per week is enough?</h2>
<p>I think that it is tough to give a simple number for everyone, but if you are in the age range of 18-50, then:</p>
<ul>
<li>150 to 300 minutes per week is an ideal level if you are walking with moderate speed</li>
<li>75 to 150 minutes per week if you are walking with a brisk pace.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t think that doing extra physical exercise will be useless. In contrast, anything above that time limit will give even higher benefits to your health, so take the timing above as a general guideline. Do as much as you want.</p>
<h2>Personal tips on walking more</h2>
<h3>Wake up earlier</h3>
<p>Right now it is very easy to blame everything on covid and health, but not many people <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/how-to-wake-up-early">wake up very early in the morning</a>, that gives people that live in the city an ability to walk as much as they want, even in usually crowded spaces.</p>
<p>Also, your excuse of not having enough time can not be reinforced if you have an extra hour in the morning.</p>
<h3>Get a pet (dog)</h3>
<p>Even though it can seem like a lousy idea, multiple research papers show a relationship between owning a dog and the number of steps you do daily. If you are struggling to make time, your favourite pet will make you find time for walks.</p>
<p><img alt="man and dog walking in forest autumn" src="https://i.gyazo.com/5e16de8c0474f84f4285df88fab28c14.jpg"></p>
<h3>Podcasts and Audiobooks</h3>
<p>I love learning and listening to books. I do it all the time even when I am at home at my desk, so a change of pace for me is always going for an extended walk where I can do the same thing.</p>
<p>What I discovered is that I understand and remember information much better when I have consumed it while walking. That makes me spend twice as little time and getting twice the result. </p>
<p>Podcasts have been my go-to method of getting new relevant news and information in my field of expertise. Since I have started a habit of walking, I have been on top of my field and able to implement solutions that I would have never thought of otherwise.</p>
<h3>Music</h3>
<p>I also love discovering new music. Sometimes when I really need to get my head around something I go for a brisk walk with my favourite songs. This helps me to unwind and later really understand the problem.</p>
<p>Most of the time while on the walk, I solve the problem that I had, and in my experience would off taken me much more time to solve.</p>
<h3>Walking groups</h3>
<p><img alt="walking groups picture" src="https://i.gyazo.com/26609ccb0d7ae90e9f746389479a32b0.jpg"></p>
<p>Sometimes socialising can be hard and especially when all of your friends are on the lockdown and all of the socialising places, such as restaurants, are closed. </p>
<p>That is where walking groups can come into play! You can find someone who is staying healthy and being diligent with their health and walk together! That will allow you to catch up and have social interaction, that we humans require.</p>
<h5>So what this means?</h5>
<p>Now you have a social responsibility in your habit, and the whole activity can let you be more motivated to do it.</p>
<p>Also, walking groups normally allow you to meet new people and to bond better with existing relationships.</p>
<p>Also, walking groups is a great way to speed up your walking pace and improve your health.</p>
<h2>How do I get better at walking?</h2>
<p>If you would like to improve the speed at which you walk, there are multiple ways to do so:</p>
<ul>
<li>As mentioned above, walking groups are amazing for giving you a speedup of pace, just make sure to not overdo it.</li>
<li>Walking poles (tracking poles) are an easy way to speed up the pace. They are especially useful for those with back or leg injury, that immensely help reduce the stress on joints and back as well as speed up the pace. There is a lot of research behind use cases and benefits of using them.</li>
<li>Treadmills. If you are unable to properly walk in the wild or in the park, get yourself a treadmill. Although they can be expensive, some are very cheap and immensely powerful alternatives provide the same result. You don’t need something overly expensive. Treadmills are great for controlling your pace as well as letting you support yourself with the rails that are at either side of the treadmill.</li>
<li>Have an open goal. Whenever you are walking, the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10413200.2020.1815100">research has shown</a> that having an open goal to where you want to walk or for how long will extend the amount of walking that you will eventually do.</li>
<li>Keep track of your metrics. Understanding what your heart rate and your pace are, is vital for your well being and motivation. Seeing that you have improved over a period of time is the greatest motivator there is.</li>
<li>Strive towards a 13 minutes per mile goal. The 13 minutes per mile has been shown to be the meeting point between fast walkers and the joggers. As …</li></ul></div></div>

      <b>Improbable Inspiration</b><p>
      The future of software may lie in the obscure theories of an
      18th century cleric named Thomas Bayes.

      </p><p>

      By LESLIE HELM, Times Staff Writer

      </p><hr>
      <p>

      When Microsoft Senior Vice President Steve
      Ballmer first heard his company was planning to make a huge
      investment in an Internet service offering movie reviews and
      local entertainment information in major cities across the
      nation, he went to Chairman Bill Gates with his concerns.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, Ballmer has billions of dollars of
      his own money in Microsoft stock, and entertainment isn't
      exactly the company's strong point.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Gates dismissed such
      reservations. Microsoft's competitive advantage, he responded,
      was its expertise in "Bayesian networks."

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asked recently when computers would finally
      begin to understand human speech, Gates began discussing the
      critical role of "Bayesian" systems.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask any other software executive about
      anything "Bayesian" and you're liable to get a blank
      stare.

      </p><p> 

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is Gates onto something? Is this
      alien-sounding technology Microsoft's new secret weapon?

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quite possibly.
      
      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bayesian networks are complex diagrams that
      organize the body of knowledge in any given area by mapping out
      cause-and-effect relationships among key variables and encoding
      them with numbers that represent the extent to which one
      variable is likely to affect another.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Programmed into computers, these systems can
      automatically generate optimal predictions or decisions even
      when key pieces of information are missing.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Microsoft in 1993 hired Eric Horvitz,
      David Heckerman and Jack Breese, pioneers in the development of
      Bayesian systems, colleagues in the field were surprised. The
      field was still an obscure, largely academic enterprise.

      </p><p>
 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today the field is still obscure. But scratch
      the surface of a range of new Microsoft products and you're
      likely to find Bayesian networks embedded in the software. And
      Bayesian nets are being built into models that are used to
      predict oil and stock prices, control the space shuttle and
      diagnose disease.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Artificial intelligence (AI) experts, who saw
      their field discredited in the early 1980s after promising a
      wave of "thinking" computers that they ultimately
      couldn't produce, believe widening acceptance of the Bayesian
      approach could herald a renaissance in the field.

      </p><p>
      
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bayesian networks provide "an
      overarching graphical framework" that brings together
      diverse elements of AI and increases the range of its likely
      application to the real world, says Michael Jordon, professor of
      brain and cognitive science at the Massachusetts Institute of
      Technology.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft is unquestionably the most
      aggressive in exploiting the new approach. The company offers a
      free Web service that helps customers diagnose printing problems
      with their computers and recommends the quickest way to resolve
      them. Another Web service helps parents diagnose their
      children's health problems.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The latest version of Microsoft Office
      software uses the technology to offer a user help based on past
      experience, how the mouse is being moved and what task is being
      done.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If his actions show he is distracted,
      he is likely to need help," Horvitz says. "If he's
      been working on a chart, chances are he needs help formatting
      the chart."

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Gates likes to talk about how computers
      are now deaf, dumb, blind and clueless. The Bayesian stuff helps
      deal with the clueless part," says Daniel T.  Ling,
      director of Microsoft's research division and a former IBM
      scientist.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bayesian networks get their name from the
      Rev. Thomas Bayes, who wrote an essay, posthumously published in
      1763, that offered a mathematical formula for calculating
      probabilities among several variables that are causally related
      but for which--unlike calculating the probability of a coin
      landing on heads or tails--the relationships can't easily be
      derived by experimentation.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early students of probability applied the
      ideas to discussions about the existence of God or efforts to
      improve their odds in gambling. Much later, social scientists
      used it to help clarify the key factors influencing a particular
      event.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it was the rapid progress in computer
      power and the development of key mathematical equations that
      made it possible for the first time, in the late 1980s, to
      compute Bayesian networks with enough variables that they were
      useful in practical applications.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bayesian approach filled a void in the
      decades-long effort to add intelligence to computers.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the late 1970s and '80s, reacting to the
      "brute force" approach to problem solving by early
      users of computers, proponents of the emerging field of
      artificial intelligence began developing software programs using
      rule-based, if-then propositions. But the systems took time to
      put together and didn't work well if, as was frequently the
      case, you couldn't answer all the computer's questions clearly.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later companies began using a technique
      called "neural nets" in which a computer would be
      presented with huge amounts of data on a particular problem and
      programmed to pull out patterns. A computer fed with a big stack
      of X-rays and told whether or not cancer was present in each
      case would pick out patterns that would then be used to
      interpret X-rays.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the neural nets won't help predict the
      unforeseen. You can't train a neural net to identify an incoming
      missile or plane because you could never get sufficient data to
      train the system.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In part because of these limitations, a slew
      of companies that popped up in the early 1980s to sell
      artificial intelligence systems virtually all went bankrupt.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many AI techniques continued to be
      used. Credit card companies, for example, began routinely using
      neural networks to pick out transactions that don't look right
      based on a consumer's past behavior. But increasingly, AI was
      regarded as a tool with limited use.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, in the late 1980s--spurred by the early
      work of Judea Pearl, a professor of computer science at UCLA,
      and breakthrough mathematical equations by <a href="http://www.hugin.dk/">Danish researchers</a>--AI
      researchers discovered that Bayesian networks offered an
      efficient way to deal with the lack or ambiguity of information
      that has hampered previous systems.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Horvitz and his two Microsoft colleagues, who
      were then classmates at Stanford University, began building
      Bayesian networks to help diagnose the condition of patients
      without turning to surgery.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The approach was efficient, says Horvitz,
      because you could combine historical data, which had been
      meticulously gathered, with the less precise but more intuitive
      knowledge of experts on how things work to get the optimal
      answer given the information available at a given time.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Horvitz, who with two colleagues founded
      Knowledge Industries to develop tools for developing Bayesian
      networks, says he and the others left the company to join
      Microsoft in part because they wanted to see their theoretical
      work more broadly applied.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the company did important work for
      the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and on medical
      diagnostics, Horvitz says, "It's not like your grandmother
      will use it."

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft's activities in the field are now
      helping to build a groundswell of support for Bayesian ideas.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "People look up to Microsoft," says
      Pearl, who wrote one of the key early texts on Bayesian networks
      in 1988 and has become an unofficial spokesman for the
      field. "They've given a boost to the whole area."
                     
      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A researcher at German conglomerate Siemens
      says Microsoft's work has drawn the attention of his superiors,
      who are now looking seriously at applying Bayesian concepts to a
      range of industrial applications.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scott Musman, a computer consultant in
      Arlington, Va., recently designed a Bayesian network for the
      Navy that can identify enemy missiles, aircraft or vessels and
      recommend which weapons could be used most advantageously
      against incoming targets.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Musman says previous attempts using
      traditional mathematical approaches on state-of-the-art
      computers would get the right answer but would take two to three
      minutes.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But you only have 30 seconds before the
      missile has hit you," says Musman.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; General Electric is using Bayesian techniques
      to develop a system that will take information from sensors
      attached to an engine and, based on expert opinion built into
      the system as well as vast amounts of data on past engine
      performance, pinpoint emerging problems.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft is working on techniques that will
      enable the Bayesian networks to "learn" or update
      themselves …</p></span></td></div></div>

Types work the <strong>same way</strong>, we classify program values based on the behaviour we’d like them to have. E.g. <code>int</code> for numbers that can be multiplied together, <code>string</code> for streams of characters that can be concatenated together.</p><p>The role of the type-checker is to prevent undesirable behaviour from happening - like concatenating <code>int</code>s or multiplying <code>string</code>s together - these operations make no sense so shouldn’t be allowed.</p><p>Most practical languages use types in one form or another. Some languages like Haskell are <em>statically</em> typed, meaning that the compiler checks the types at <em>compile-time</em>. You might argue, what about languages like JavaScript? There’s no compile-time type-checking there. These languages are <em>dynamically</em> typed, that is values are tagged with types and we check types at <em>runtime</em>, and throw a runtime error if types are mismatched. The runtime error acts as a very late safety check, stopping you just before you try to access a field of something that is <code>undefined</code>. So even JavaScript has types under the hood.</p><p>This all means that at some point, your fancy new language will likely implement some form of type-checking. With Bolt, I’ve chosen to implement <em>static</em> type-checking, i.e. the type-checking is another stage of our compiler.</p><p>Right now this all feels a little hand-wavey. What we need to do is take our high-level goal of “preventing undesirable behaviour” and formalise this. We want a list of rules to check a program against, and then if it passes those, we know our program is safe.</p><p>Enter <em>type systems</em>.</p><h2 id="type-systems"><a href="#type-systems" aria-label="type systems permalink"></a>Type Systems</h2><p>A type system consists of a set of rules, or <em>typing judgements</em>, that assigns a type <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">t</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> to an expression <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>e</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">e</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.

We could have equally written this as <code>let x : t = e</code> - where the programmer <em>annotates</em> <code>x</code> with type <code>t</code>. e.g. <code>let x : int = 1 + 2</code>.</p><p>These lead to different typing algorithms - in the first case the compiler <em>infers</em> that <code>1+2</code> has type <code>int</code>, and in the second case, the compiler has to <em>check</em> that <code>1+2</code> has type <code>int</code> (since we specified the type <code>int</code> of <code>x</code>).</p><p>As you might imagine, type inference means that the programmer has to write fewer type annotations, but it is much more complex for the compiler - it’s like filling a Sudoku from scratch versus checking a Sudoku solution is valid. OCaml and Haskell are examples of languages with type inference baked in.</p><p>In practice, most statically-typed languages do require some type annotations, but can infer some types (e.g. the <code>auto</code> keyword in C++). This is like completing a partially solved Sudoku puzzle and is much easier.</p><p>For Bolt, we’re going to infer types <em>within</em> a function or method definition, but require programmers to annotate the parameter and return types. This is a nice middle ground.</p><div><p><span>example_function.bolt</span></p><div><pre><p><span>function</span><span> int </span><span>something</span><span>(</span><span>int x</span><span>,</span><span> bool y</span><span>)</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> z </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>...</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>...</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Okay, enough theory, let’s get to implementing this type-checker!</p><h2 id="implementing-a-type-checker"><a href="#implementing-a-type-checker" aria-label="implementing a type checker permalink"></a>Implementing a Type-checker</h2><h3 id="just-give-me-the-code"><a href="#just-give-me-the-code" aria-label="just give me the code permalink"></a>Just give me the code!</h3><p>You’ll need to clone the Bolt repository:</p><div><div><pre><p><span>git</span><span> clone https://github.com/mukul-rathi/bolt</span></p></pre></div></div><p>The <a href="https://github.com/mukul-rathi/bolt">Bolt repository</a> <code>master</code> branch contains a more complex type-checker, with support for inheritance, function/method overloading and generics.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As in the lovely child’s quote found on the internet —</p><blockquote><p>I know everything. Except anything I don’t.</p></blockquote><p>— we think that we see everything around us. But we don’t. There are so many things that greatly affect our lives, yet we don’t aware of them. One type of such things is deep inside us — the flaws of our own thinking. Here is my top list of those flaws.</p><h2 id="1-wishful-thinking-conservatism-and-conformism"><strong>1. Wishful thinking, conservatism and conformism</strong></h2><p>By <em>wishful thinking</em> I don’t mean optimism, which is rather speculation about the future. Wishful thinking is when we put more weight on the present knowledge that is pleasant to us, and at the same time ignore the knowledge that is not so nice. For example, people like to ignore the knowledge that puts them in a bad light. This is clearly seen in toxic relationships, where an abuser justifies his actions by “the care” of its victim. A dictator probably thinks that he is doing the best for its nation, while completely ignoring his incapabilities and bad doings. The same is true for groups of people or even nations. An invasion is commonly portrayed as liberation.</p><p>On the other hand, anyone who had experienced an addiction probably knows how it can alter decision-making. “Vodka is an antiseptic, didn’t you know? Let’s drink those bottles so we’ll be healthier!” Gambler thinks that he is going to make money, so his family will be happy. An ordinary gamer thinks that other real affairs are not that important, so it’s ok to spend more time on the game.</p><p>This is just few examples, but such thinking is so common that I don’t think a single book will be enough to collect all different “use cases”.</p><hr><p>Another flaw of our thinking is <em>conservatism</em> — an insufficient ability to change our common views and beliefs with the new data, new evidence. This is understandable — changing basis views leads to a reconsideration of all related knowledge. An enormous amount of rebuilding is required. Our biological brains just can’t do that in a short time, also it’s much harder with age. Because of this, we give much more weight to old knowledge rather than new evidence, thus making a conservatism bias.</p><p>In our rapidly changing world, this problem will have even more impact.</p><hr><p><em>Conformism</em> is when we weigh our knowledge in accordance with our community. The effect of this is highly underrated. An ordinary human thinks that “her thoughts are her own”, without realizing to what extent they are shaped by a community. I think that we’re all conformists to some degree. And it’s hard to imagine what’s that means not to be. This is proved by numerous experiments with a group of actors and one unsuspicious testee, where actors trick the testee to make some ridiculous statements or to do some crazy actions, like the one described <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP22DpYYh8">here</a>. We are social creatures.</p><p>An extreme version of conformist thinking is the one imposed by religion. I’m not against religions in general, they can be useful, but a blind belief, an unquestioning subordination to “sacred” authorities — that’s just a disaster for a clear mind. A clear mind should have the ability to stress any dogmas.</p><h2 id="2-binary-black-and-white-thinking-overgeneralization"><strong>2. Binary (black-and-white) thinking, overgeneralization</strong></h2><p>Good-evil, smart-stupid, beautiful-ugly, tall-short, fast-slow, and so on and on. We think in binary terms. Our language reflects that. And some people are stuck very hard in such thinking. The worst case of it is <em>all-or-nothing</em> thinking, when any result other than the best is considered as a failure. It causes stress and depression in people. They don’t realize anymore why the world is so mean to them. They stop seeing how many gradients are there, and also how colorful our world is.</p><p>A similar flaw is <em>overgeneralization</em>. We put into the same category very broad types of information. Prejudice, labeling, stereotypes are all related to overgeneralization.</p><h2 id="3-self-projecting-thinking"><strong>3. Self-projecting thinking</strong></h2><p>Mind reading is an ability that everyone would like to have. It would be so easier to communicate. Also, it’s an advantage if we could read the thoughts of our rivals. While we can’t do it in reality, we’re still trying to predict other people’s thoughts, both in collaboration and confrontation.</p><p>To make such predictions we use two main assumptions:</p><ol><li>Other people see the same things as we do.</li><li>Other people are like us, thus their way of thinking is similar to ours.</li></ol><p>Based on these assumptions we use our way of thinking to deduce the thoughts of others. And this is very natural since we have to model another person’s thinking somehow. But the only model that we have is ours. It’s the only model that we can use. So, we essentially project our mind into another person’s head.</p><p>This has a fatal flaw. Because both main assumptions are only half true. While we see the same bits of the world, perception is a way more complex process. From bits we see high-order patterns, but they can be very personal. People could see different patterns and focus on different things. Also, the same bits (e.g. colors) can cause different emotions. Associations are also personal. The way we do conclusions is also very different in people because every person has its own experience, principles, beliefs, preferences, etc. We do not understand how unique the mind of every human.</p><p>And this causes a lot of trouble. People are fighting because of misunderstandings. In most situations they don’t realize, that they are fighting against their own reflection (from a distorting mirror).</p><h2 id="4-human-centric-thinking"><strong>4. Human-centric thinking</strong></h2><p>Humans are extremely focused on their own businesses. Yes, we are successful as a whole, in comparison to other creatures. But we are still part of nature. We follow its laws. Despite this, we neglect nature and the life of other species at scale.</p><p>Moreover, we value leaders, rulers and heroes amongst us much more than others. Even in fiction secondary characters usually die (who cares), while all hail goes to the main performers. We think that leaders are responsible for like 99% of the job done. Thus, we are trying to analyze them, rather than abstract patterns, situations and laws of nature. For example, from the popular culture it may look like Hitler was solely responsible for WWII and the Holocaust. Yeah, sure. How about WWI? Or any other war, genocide, mass conflict in human history? It’s silly to think that all these things were mainly because of leaders. This is just how humans work. In every moment in history there is a mix of wishes, intentions, beliefs, possibilities, thoughts of a total population. It could be that nature just picks a random guy as a leader that represents the mass.</p><p>On the other hand, we think that human is a singular, indivisible unit. That’s also not true. We are a composition of attributes, that are selected by evolution. Any child has some attributes from its mother and some attributes from its father. Human is a composable organism, the same is true for its mind. I’m sure that everyone experienced competing thoughts in his head. There is a natural selection of thoughts ongoing in the mind of every human.</p><h2 id="5-false-associations-confusion-of-causation-and-correlation"><strong>5. False associations, confusion of causation and correlation</strong></h2><p>Our thinking is associative, and we can make connections very fast based on very small data. A typical example is superstition, which is clearly seen in <a href="https://www.psychologistworld.com/superstition">pigeon experiments</a>.</p><p>Survival bias and filtering are accompanying flaws that lead to false associations. In probability theory, this is related to the fact that independent events are not necessary conditionally independent.</p><p>Even when our associations are quite objective we can make false conclusions about the causes. In fact, in probability theory and statistics the notion of a <em>cause</em> is not even defined. Events can be either correlated or independent in this theory. To deduce <em>what causes what</em> we use other tools, like common sense, physics, etc. Typically, to deduce a causation from two correlated events, we check two main things:</p><ol><li>One event is earlier in time than another one.</li><li>There is no common cause that could explain the correlation.</li></ol><p>This is hard stuff even for scientists. Because you have to exclude any possible common cause. Earlier we could use physical locality of events to exclude a lot of possible common causes. But with the advance of quantum mechanics, even locality is not a reliable factor anymore.</p><h2 id="final-words"><strong>Final words</strong></h2><p>There are a lot of other flaws, if you want to learn more you can start <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias">here</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_distortion">here</a>. But those described above I find the most impactful. I feel them myself and meet them all the time.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>As a startup founder, you get pulled in a million different directions from the moment you start your company. It can be overwhelming to have to learn so many new skills at once: raising funds, hiring a team, managing people.</p>
<p>Before I started <a href="https://draft.dev/">Draft.dev</a> earlier this year, I spent almost a decade working with startups, reading, and preparing myself to run a business. I worked with some great people, met fantastic mentors, and read some outstanding books that gave me the confidence to go out on my own. In this post, I’ll give you my list of the best startup books available today.</p>
<h2 id="early-stage-startups">Early-Stage Startups</h2>
<p>This category includes books for people who are just starting out. If you are building your first product or raising the first round of funding, these books will provide you with a good starting point.</p>
<h3 id="founders-at-work-stories-of-startups-early-days"><a href="https://amzn.to/390FASS">Founders at Work: Stories of Startups’ Early Days</a></h3>
<p>What I love about this book is that it shows you how several popular technology companies started out. The book is a collection of interviews with founders of Paypal, Hotmail, Apple, and other giants of our era. It’s interesting to see where they got the ideas that eventually made them household names and how they recovered from various difficulties along the way.</p>
<p>“If you’re thinking about entrepreneurship you should read this book to get familiar with the possibilities, both the positives and the challenges. From the success arrived by a detour to the success of following a dedicated plan. There’s much to absorb and it’s just plain interesting.”</p>
<h3 id="the-innovators-dilemma"><a href="https://amzn.to/3nxL9fs">The Innovator’s Dilemma</a></h3>
<p>Written by the Harward professor and businessman Clayton Christensen, The Innovator’s Dilemma is one of the most important business books on the market. It explains how mammoth, successful companies can lose market leadership in a blink of an eye as new competitors rise and become dominant in emerging segments of their market.</p>
<p>“Christensen shows that successful innovation is not unpredictable. This comes with the recognition, however, that “data only exist about the past” and hence what is working in the present for leading firms need not apply to disruptive firms of the future. This paradigm necessarily applies to all companies and is not exclusive to technological ones.”</p>
<h3 id="the-lean-startup"><a href="https://amzn.to/2KhETKk">The Lean Startup</a></h3>
<p>We live in an age where technology changes rapidly and quickly changes the market around it. This means that sometimes, you have to move fast to avoid getting swallowed up by innovation. In The Lean Startup, Ries talks about his own business failure and how he spent too much time on the initial product launch instead of focusing on validating the market.</p>
<p>“This book focuses on giving an overview of Lean methods and convincing you why you should use them. It uses a lot of examples, mainly from startups. Some of the best examples come from the author’s own experience, and his company continues to do well.”</p>
<h3 id="zero-to-one-notes-on-startups-or-how-to-build-the-future"><a href="https://amzn.to/3fg4EWN">Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3fg4EWN"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/eN4XABh.jpg" alt="Zero to One book cover"></a></p>
<p>I don’t love Peter Thiel’s politics, but I do like how he pushes readers to think for themselves. He explains that you don’t necessarily have to fight the competition to be the leader in the market. Instead, by thinking out of the box and creating a brand new market, you can become a leader with no competition at all. With a unique idea, you can escape the rivals and focus completely on your unique value proposition.</p>
<p>“Let me assure you that Zero to One is worth reading, even if you’re not engaged in the world of startups and venture capital. It’s worth reading in the same way a triple espresso is worth drinking: it makes you feel superhuman, at least for the moment. You can almost hear the caffeine coursing through your veins as you absorb the ideas.”</p>
<h3 id="the-art-of-the-start"><a href="https://amzn.to/38YBhXT">The Art of the Start</a></h3>
<p>Although named “The Art of the Start,” this book covers various business areas, including the art of launching, positioning, socializing, and marketing your startup. In 13 easy-to-read chapters, Guy Kawasaki talks about crucial topics for startup founders like finding a business idea, finding the right co-founder, writing a vision statement, and defining your business model.</p>
<p>“Never assume you’re done. Recruiting doesn’t stop when a candidate accepts your offer, nor when he resigns from his current employer, nor on his last day at his current employer—not even after he starts at your organization. In actuality, recruiting never stops. Every day is a new contract between a startup and an employee.”</p>
<h3 id="the-startup-owners-manual"><a href="https://amzn.to/3nxLiQ2">The Startup Owner’s Manual</a></h3>
<p>With over a hundred charts, graphs, and valuable checklists, this book helps startup founders in many ways. For example, it teaches you how to avoid “deadly sins” that lead your business to failure and how to drive your company to repeatable and scalable profits. The methods in this book were created by Steve Blank, a famous Silicon Valley startup, and were tested by him for more than a decade.</p>
<p>“Best entrepreneur book period. If you liked Lean Startup (another great read/education) you’ll love this one by Steve Blank. He taught those guys. I love how the author really reset your approach and lays out a clear plan on how to test and scale.”</p>
<h2 id="growth-stage-startups">Growth Stage Startups</h2>
<p>Books in this category will teach you how to grow your business from the first few customers to wider adoption. These will also help you sell high-dollar products and scale your sales to the next level.</p>
<h3 id="crossing-the-chasm-marketing-and-selling-high-tech-products-to-mainstream-customers"><a href="https://amzn.to/2UL4oWm">Crossing the Chasm: Marketing and Selling High-Tech Products to Mainstream Customers</a></h3>
<p>I first read this classic over a decade ago. It explains the way products move to progressively more mainstream markets and how you can cross the “chasm” from early adopters to these lucrative mass markets. Although technology changes rapidly, the principles in Crossing the Chasm can still be applied in the software industry today.</p>
<p>“The author’s emphasis is on distinguishing between the selling and marketing tactics for the early innovators versus mainstream customers. There is a chasm between the innovators and mainstream market and the author dedicates the book outlining the various steps a high tech company should perform to successfully navigate through the chasm.”</p>
<h3 id="hacking-growth-how-todays-fastest-growing-companies-drive-breakout-success"><a href="https://amzn.to/35Mrz99">Hacking Growth: How Today’s Fastest-Growing Companies Drive Breakout Success</a></h3>
<p>Ever wonder why Facebook unseated early entrants like MySpace to become the number one social network? Or how Uber succeeded despite seeming to have no chance against New York’s Yellow Cabs? With the proper methodology - known as “growth hacking” - they became the giants of our era. Sean and Morgan’s stories inspired me, and I recommend this book to any founder who will handle marketing.</p>
<p>“The authors walk the reader through each stage of building a growth machine, give examples from real companies, and, the best part, they apply this process to a hypothetical scenario/product so you can see what it would look like from beginning to end.”</p>
<h3 id="the-hard-thing-about-hard-things"><a href="https://amzn.to/3fjCUAS">The Hard Thing About Hard Things</a></h3>
<p>This book is a collection of stories from the career of Ben Horowitz, one of the most respected entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley. It reveals problems that he faced during his journey from being a founder to becoming an investor. It analyzes difficulties that confront leaders every day, related to management, selling, investment, and staying balanced.</p>
<p>“If you’re planning to start a company, whether it’s a high-tech company or the kinds of companies that I started and ran, read this book. If you’re going to be someone in charge of anything in any kind of a company, read this book.”</p>

<p>Early in my career, I worked too much on too many projects. It took me nearly a decade to figure out that putting hours into <em>the right</em> things was the key. This book debunks the myth of multitasking, talks about coordinating between priorities, and reveals how to make your work time more productive.</p>
<p>“With the massive amount of business books published every year, it’s tough to find a book with some original ideas. This book is one of those. What’s great about it is that there isn’t a lot of fluff and the book gets to the points of what can help one become a great performer. I would recommend this book to any leader out there who wants to help his or her team grow and become more, with less of the wrong kind of work.”</p>
<h2 id="hiring-and-management">Hiring and Management</h2>
<p>At some point in running a business, you will have to build a team of professionals around you. You will likely move into management, which requires an entirely new set of skills. These books helped me out, and I’m sure you will find them useful, too.</p>
<h3 id="recruit-rockstars-the-10-step-playbook-to-find-the-winners-and-ignite-your-business"><a href="https://amzn.to/3fjDuP4">Recruit Rockstars: The 10 Step Playbook to Find the Winners and Ignite Your Business</a></h3>
<p>I learned the hard way that <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/hiring-process">many business-related problems have their roots in poor hiring practices</a>. Instead of hiring consistent A-players, many startup founders rush to assemble half-hearted teams that are bound to fail. Hyman shows his ten practical steps to recruiting top talent in this book. My favorite part was about choosing employees based on data instead of gut feeling, and I used this to create <a href="https://draft.dev/learn/posts/hiring-rubric">my first hiring rubric at Draft.dev</a>.</p>
<p>“This is the recruitment guide that every startup needs to read. It’s especially valuable for people who might not have a background in recruiting but find themselves in a position where they need to hire the best. Recruit Rockstars is a clear and concise guide that won’t waste your time and gives you the recruitment background you need. I can’t recommend this book enough!”</p>
<h3 id="high-output-management"><a href="https://amzn.to/393d7eX">High Output Management</a></h3>
<p>Written by the former chairman of Intel, this book shows startup founders how to build highly productive teams that lead the company to peak performance. Management isn’t about posturing or power-struggles. It’s about getting results.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/urnxGMb.jpg" alt="High Output Management book"></p>
<p>“The author emphasizes the importance of judging managers based on the output that they achieve, which is an accumulation of the outputs of the people that work for them. He also focuses on the importance of continuing to improve yourself and strive to be better. He rightly points out that nobody owes you …</p></div></article></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <h2 id="i">I</h2><p>When Sweden announced their laissez-faire approach to COVID-19, experts, and politicians around the world, were in disbelief. Without a lockdown and mandatory masks, this could only end in a disaster. The famous model used to justify the lockdown in the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/neil-ferguson-transformed-uk-covid-response-oxford-challenge-imperial-model-2020-4?r=DE&amp;IR=T">UK and many other countries</a>, predicted 100.000 deaths by June if Sweden did not follow all the other countries and institute strict measures. It is now November, and at the time of writing, 6,972 people have died in Sweden from COVID-19. So what happened?</p><h2 id="ii">II</h2><p>Let’s take a step back and look at the famous model, which was the basis for many of the government measures back in March as well as for the 100.000 death prediction: The Imperial Model. It was developed by Neil Fergusson and his team at the Imperial College London.</p><p>The involvement of Neils Fergusson should already have raised doubts about the validity of the model because his track record, and there is no other way to say this, is terrible. If you think it cannot be that bad, you are in for a surprise.</p><p>We will do what <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/neil-ferguson-transformed-uk-covid-response-oxford-challenge-imperial-model-2020-4?r=DE&amp;IR=T">Business Insider</a> promised back in April:</p><blockquote>Here's what we know about “Professor Lockdown” and the gold standard in science that is Imperial College.</blockquote><p>Of course, they did not mention his past predictions, and the “gold standard” turned out to be fake gold, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. His past predictions:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Ferguson-Estimating-the-human-health-risk-from-possible-BSE-infection-of-the-British-sheep-flock.pdf">In 2002</a>, Ferguson predicted that up to 150,000 people could die from exposure to BSE (mad cow disease) in the U.K. There were only 177 deaths.</li><li><a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/professor-lockdown-modeler-resigns-in-disgrace/">In 2009</a>, Ferguson predicted that the bird flu could kill 150 million people. 282 people died worldwide.</li><li><a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/six-questions-that-neil-ferguson-should-be-asked">In 2009</a>, Ferguson predicted as a “reasonable worst-case scenario” that the swine flu would kill 65,000 people in Britain. It killed 457.</li></ul><p>I think that is enough about our “Professor Lockdown.” We want to focus more on the model and “the gold standard in science that is Imperial College.”</p><h2 id="iii">III</h2><p>One reason why nobody doubted the model was that it was secret—always a smart move. When on March 16, 2020, Neil and his team published their paper, they did not publish their code. Yes, you read that correctly. Their paper made several policy recommendations based on predictions of a model <em>they did not publish</em>. So there was no way of knowing if their claims were true or false. They were simply baseless claims without any evidence.</p><p>To me, this destroys any trustworthiness Neil Ferguson might have had left. One hallmark of science is independent verifiability. Without others being able to verify the claims and run the model themselves, it is not science; it is pseudo-science with a strong appeal to authority.</p><p>On April 27, over one month after the paper in question was published, they finally released their code on <a href="https://github.com/mrc-ide/covid-sim">GitHub</a>. However, it turns out that they did not release the original code used to generate the predictions in their paper. The released version was edited by software engineers of GitHub to make it acceptable:</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Before the GitHub team started working on the code it was a single 15k line C file that had been worked on for a decade, and some of the functions looked like they were machine translated from Fortran. There are some tropes about academic code that have grains of truth, but \</p>— John Carmack (@ID_AA_Carmack) <a href="https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1254872369556074496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 27, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>As you can read in this Tweet, the original code was “a single 15k line C file that had been worked on for a decade.” Everyone with a little bit of knowledge about software engineering should be shocked. A single 15000 line C file is beyond bad practice.</p><p>But even GitHubs’s engineers could not salvage the code. The released version is still riddled with bugs and random equations that literally nobody can explain. Moreover, even if the released code were exactly the code used in the paper, no one could have replicated the results because the input parameters used in the paper were not published. As the <a href="https://github.com/mrc-ide/covid-sim/tree/master/data">GitHub page</a> reads:</p><blockquote>IMPORTANT: The parameter files are provided as a sample only and do not necessarily reflect runs used in published papers.</blockquote><p>At this point, we are long past science, with a small s, and far into the world of Science, with a capital S. The latter is the world where the term “Believe the Science” makes sense. While science (small s) is the process of doubting everything, disregarding authority, and searching for the truth, Science (capital S) is where the truth is determined by fiat, and your job is to believe, not question it. But I digress.</p><h2 id="iv">IV</h2><p>After several issues around the non-deterministic behavior of the model were brought up on GitHub, the team responded with an <a href="https://github.com/mrc-ide/covid-sim/issues/116#issuecomment-617304550">interesting answer</a>:</p><blockquote>We are aware of some small non-determinisms when using multiple threads to set up the network of people and places. (Look for the omp critical pragmas in the code). This has historically been considered acceptable because of the general stochastic nature of the model.</blockquote><p>Non-deterministic means that given the same input, you do not always get the same output (non-deterministic behavior is not necessarily bad; only in cases like this where it is not explainable). Their answer to this problem was that it does not matter because the model is “stochastic,” which is just a fancy word for saying that they run the model multiple times and average over all the outcomes.</p><p>Every time a new issue around non-determinism came up or a different bug was discovered, the team’s answer was the <a href="https://github.com/mrc-ide/covid-sim/issues/30">same</a>:</p><blockquote>This isn’t a problem running the model in full as it is stochastic anyway.</blockquote><p>But is this really true? You do not have to worry about bugs because “it is stochastic anyway”? The answer is, obviously, no.</p><p>To understand this stochastic magic better, let’s take a look at an example: baking a cake. If we weigh flour, we might weigh it several times and then average over all these measurements—only if we are nerds and want to follow the recipe particularly closely, of course. But why does this give us a more accurate result? The answer is that if, for example, we make an error when reading from the scale (imagine an old analog scale), then an error in one direction (more) is as likely as an error in the other direction (less). In other words, if the flour weighs 100 grams, you are just as likely to mistake it for 102 g the first time, and 98 g the next. Only if we make mistakes sometimes in one direction and sometimes in another, averaging out works. Otherwise, <em>it does not</em>. If your scale is broken, and always shows five grams more, averaging does not help you.</p><p>The same is true for bugs. If, and only if, we could be sure that the bugs distort the output sometimes upwards and sometimes downwards (preferably with equal probability and magnitude), we could solve the problem by running the model “stochastically.” However, this is not the case because, by definition, we do not know how bugs affect the code; otherwise we would understand them and probably be able to fix them. The point is that nobody, including the “scientists” who produced this model, can know how those bugs affect the code.</p><p>Do not get me wrong, stochastic models are not necessarily like this. Most of the time, if the model is not too complicated (we will get to this point later), small changes in the input create small changes in the output, and the randomness in the output stems from intentionally included pseudo-randomness. However, this model is not non-deterministic in the predictable (explainable) mathematical sense. It is non-deterministic in the angry-toddler-in-a-toy-store sense: nobody knows what is going to happen, and there is no way to replicate it. <a href="https://medium.com/@allenfarrington/simple-truths-and-complex-nonsense-2e1c28ae6f29">Put differently</a>:</p><blockquote>It has nondeterministic outputs that do not follow from seeded pseudorandomness but are rather an inexplicable part of the process. I am not using “inexplicable” rhetorically here: nobody can explain this. This is one of the great issues in Complexity Science. Clearly there is a stark mathematical difference between deterministic and non-deterministic. But there is also a fuzzy, and arguably more important, difference between non-deterministic and really, really, really NON-DETERMINISTIC.</blockquote><p>Unfortunately, the Imperial Model falls into the latter category.</p><h2 id="v">V</h2><p>Alright, a summary of what we have learned so far: the code was not released with the paper; the released code is not the code used in the paper; the original code was a single 15 thousand line C file; the model is non-deterministic bordering on chaotic; the parameters released are not the parameters used in the paper; the code is riddled with bugs. An impressive list for a “scientific” model that informed government decisions on life and death.</p><h2 id="vi">VI</h2><p>But what about the model without the code? Sure, the code that implements the model is awful, but maybe they have figured out a great way to model pandemics and just need better software engineering to make it work. Sadly, this is not the case.</p><p>Do you remember the parameters that were <em>not</em> provided so nobody could replicate the results of the paper? It turns out that the model has 450 input parameters. Let me say it again: the model depends on <em>450 (!!!)</em> parameters. Nobody can understand a model with this many parameters. And it gets even worse because as it turns out, complex systems like pandemics have many interdependencies, which complicates everything. As described by Allen <a href="https://medium.com/@allenfarrington/simple-truths-and-complex-nonsense-2e1c28ae6f29">here</a>:</p><blockquote>Now I should be clear that, maybe, the virus is that complicated. But it doesn’t matter. Because we can’t possibly understand this. And actually I lowballed it by a factor of 450 (Oh, God …). Because if this system is linear, which it surely is not, what this really means is that a single set of parameters can be represented as a 450-dimensional column vector acting on a 450x450 matrix with 450² = 202k independent numbers. Because, remember, the parameters can be anything. Katya suspects they are totally made up. So it’s not just the dimensions we need to account for. The surface of the earth has 2 dimensions but more than 2 locations. Assuming every entry in this matrix has only two possible states, which it surely does not, this model maps a system with at least …</blockquote></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Today I want to give you an introduction to the programming language Elixir, some of its features and why you might want to check it out!</p>
</section><article><section><h2>The basics</h2>
<p>First things first: Elixir is a concurrent functional language that runs on the Erlang VM. It is inspired by many different languages where Ruby and Erlang are most obvious ones based on the syntax.</p>
<p>Elixir is a <a href="https://thinkingelixir.com/elixir-in-the-type-system-quadrant/">strong, dynamically typed language</a>. This puts it in the same category as Ruby and Python and it has optional functionality for compile time type checking as well.Elixirs data structures are immutable, but variables can be reassigned/rebound. <sup><sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup></sup> This was a bit strange for me in that I got started with FP through Elm where there are no variables, just constants.</p>
<p>Elixir inherits a lot its data structures and related syntax from Erlang which in many ways is its biggest influence. <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2013/08/08/elixir-design-goals/">Elixir Design Goals</a> describes the relation to Erlang like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elixir is meant to be compatible with the Erlang VM and the existing ecosystem. When we talk about Erlang, we can break it into three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A functional programming language, called Erlang</li>
<li>A set of design principles, called OTP (Open Telecom Plaform)</li>
<li>The Erlang Virtual Machine, referred to as EVM or BEAM</li>
</ul>
<p>Elixir runs in the same virtual machine and is compatible with OTP. Not only that, all the tools and libraries available in the Erlang ecosystem are also available in Elixir, simply because there is no conversion cost from calling Erlang from Elixir and vice-versa.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a great feature of Elixir that we will talk more about later.</p>
<p>As for other inspirations Elixir has docstrings from Python, polymorphism and protocols from Clojure, macros and meta-programming from different Lisps, just to name a few. <sup><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></sup></p>
<h3>Hello World!</h3>
<p>As I said, Elixir is a concurrent functional programming language. For the functional part it means that Elixir mainly uses functions and modules for code structure and has other features that are associated with functional languages. We'll talk about the concurrent part later. </p>
<p>A hello world example in Elixir might look something like this:</p>
<div data-language="elixir"><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> HelloWorld
  <span>def</span> hello_world <span>do</span>
    IO<span>.</span>puts<span>(</span><span>"Hello, World!"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here we define a module with a function that simply writes "Hello, World!" to the console.</p>
<h2>Killer applications</h2>
<p>Many programming languages has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_application">"killer apps"</a>; libraries, frameworks and use cases, that in themself are enough to justify the transition to the language or try it out. For Ruby it was the web framework Ruby on Rails and in many ways Elixir has its own Rails: Phoenix.</p>
<h3>Phoenix web framework</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix</a> is inspired by Rails (the team originally behind Elixir was previously a Ruby shop) and was an early addition to the Elixir community. The creators of Phoenix has learned from years of Rails development and made their own opinions in addition to the natural changes needed when going from an object oriented language to a functional language.
Compared to Rails Phoenix has with the help of the Erlang VM great performance. Some of you might have heard about Phoenix' amazing <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/the-road-to-2-million-websocket-connections">2 million simultaneous web sockets</a> benchmark!</p>
<h3>The Nerves Project</h3>
<p>Another interesting project in the Elixir ecosystem is the embedded/IoT project <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves</a>. Nerves makes it possible to use Elixir code to create embedded system where previously you would have had to use a low level language like C. This does not stop you from bringing your own code (like C, C++, Python, Rust, and more) while using Nerves as a platform for your IoT project.
The project web site says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nerves is a complete IoT platform and infrastructure for you to build and deploy maintainable embedded systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The BEAM and OTP</h2>
<p>When talking about the advantages of Elixir it is hard to not talk about the advantages of Erlang and its virtual machine, the BEAM (Bogdan's Erlang Abstract Machine). It is in many ways the biggest selling point for Elixir. We are now talking about the concurrent part of Elixir. Erlang and the BEAM has shown its resiliency over many years, exemplified in giving Ericsson 9 nines (99.9999999%) availability in their AXD301 switch.<sup><sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup></sup> It is known for its "let it break" philosophy and self-healing properties and by being compatible with Erlang, Elixir inherits a lot of these traits.</p>
<p>Elixirs creator, Jose Valim, attributes one of the motivational factors for the creation of Elixir to the rise of multi-core CPUs and the need to utilize these. Ruby and other languages with a global interperter lock (GIL) limits this, but the Erlang VM and the tools and design prinsiples of OTP have proven to be a great choice for creating concurrent, performant and resilient applications.</p>
<h3>Everything is a process</h3>
<p>Everything in the BEAM is a process. These are not OS processes, but lightweight processes which can be cheaply spawned and killed. In his PhD thesis the co-inventor of Erlang, Joe Armstrong, summarized Erlangs principles regarding processes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Everything is a process.</li>
<li>Processes are strongly isolated.</li>
<li>Process creation and destruction is a lightweight operation.</li>
<li>Message passing is the only way for processes to interact.</li>
<li>Processes have unique names.</li>
<li>If you know the name of a process you can send it a message.</li>
<li>Processes share no resources.</li>
<li>Error handling is non-local.</li>
<li>Processes do what they are supposed to do or fail.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Sidenote: For some this may sound vaguely familiar. Some object oriented languages has had similar principles, but instead of processes they are applied to objects. Smalltalk is reported to be one of the inspirations to Erlang and it is fun to think about Erlang being a functional language but still be more object oriented than some object oriented languages. This is of course not the case as the definition of OOP has changed over time and Erlang is a functional language, but it is fun to ponder the similarities. 😄 Back to the main story! 😅</p>
<p>These unique principles for processes where they communicate through messages lays a great foundation for creating concurrent application, but there is one more piece to the puzzle: OTP.</p>
<h3>OTP - The Open Telecom Platform</h3>
<p>As with so many other parts of this article OTP is a big topic and could be a separate article, but I'll try make it short! Today the name is a bit strange but it was created by Ericsson for their telephone switches in the 80s and 90s so in that context in makes more sense.</p>
<p>OTP is an integral part of many Erlang applications. In essence OTP is a set of design principles and standards including tools and libraries to make it easier to create applications that adheres to them.<sup><sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup></sup> </p>
<p>Since Elixir is compatible with OTP we can leverage these principles and technologies that has been battle tested in high-pressure and critical applications for decades!</p>
<h2>The take-away</h2>
<p>Luckily you don't need to understand or know much about Erlang, BEAM and OTP.
Without deep knowledge of these topics you can still reap the benefits of highly performing web applications and resilient IoT applications. It would certainly help but it is not a prerequisite. This is the great thing about Elixir: it is an approachable language with battle tested underpinnings! 💪</p>
<p>It might not be your idea of a perfect language. It is not mine either, but that does not stop me from using the great tools at my disposal. If you are all into Haskell or the likes it might not be something you would use and that is OK. Whatever your preferences are you might now know a little more about Elixir and Erlang and some more knowledge is always a good thing. 😄</p>
<p>If you would like to check Elixir out I recommend checking out <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html">the official Getting started guide</a> or the interactive guide <a href="https://try-elixir.herokuapp.com/">Try Elixir</a> and then trying out a project with Phoenix or Nerves. Hands-on experience is always better than something you read on the internet! 🤓</p>
<p>Psst! By the way: there are other languages that run on the BEAM. <a href="https://lfe.io/">Lisp variants</a> and lately some work on <a href="https://gleam.run/">strong statically compiled ML-like languges</a> if you are into that!</p>

Sorry once again for the infrequent posts.
I've been busy.
Originally, because I was supposed to get married this summer.
Then because my fiancée cheated on me while I was watching my grandfather die
and moved in with the other guy the following week.
So that's been fun, but I'm trying to get back into some more productive habits.
Hopefully that includes blogging regularly.

<h2 id="sum-types-and-you">Sum Types and You</h2>

<p>Let’s talk about a simple, yet powerful concept in programming: <em>sum types</em>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>A sum type, also called a <em>discriminated union</em>,
can hold one (and only one) of several types of things.
For example, consider some settings in an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file">INI</a>-like configuration file.
Let’s say that each setting must be a string, an integer, or a Boolean value.
If we wanted to roll our own solution in C++, we might write something resembling:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Setting</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>union</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>string</span> <span>str</span><span>;</span>
        <span>int</span> <span>num</span><span>;</span>
        <span>bool</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span>
    <span>};</span>
    <span>enum</span> <span>Type</span> <span>{</span> <span>Str</span><span>,</span> <span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>};</span>
    <span>Type</span> <span>tag</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>// Map settings to their names.
</span><span>using</span> <span>Settings</span> <span>=</span> <span>unordered_map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>string</span><span>,</span> <span>Setting</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Here be dragons, though, since we must always remember to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Update <code>tag</code> whenever assigning a new value.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only retrieve the correct type from the union (according to <code>tag</code>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Call constructors and destructors at appropriate times for all non-trivial types.
(<code>string</code> is the only one here, but you could imagine similar
scenarios with others.)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If a step is ever forgotten, the object falls into an
inconsistent state and there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
You could encapsulate all this trickery and interact with the type
through a series of methods—e.g., <code>getType()</code>, <code>asBool()</code>,
<code>asString()</code>, and so on—but this is quite verbose.
It also just shifts the problem onto whoever implements these methods; they
still need to carefully maintain the invariants with no help from the language.</p>

<p>It would be much nicer if a general-purpose sum type was provided by the standard
library.
In C++17, we finally get one!
It’s called <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/variant"><code>std::variant</code></a>.
Let’s take a look.</p>

<h2 id="using-stdvariant">Using <code>std::variant</code></h2>

<p><code>variant</code> is a class template that takes, as template parameters, the types
it could hold.
For the example above,
we could define a setting as a <code><span>variant</span><span>&lt;</span><span>string</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>bool</span><span>&gt;</span></code>.
Assigning a value to a <code>variant</code> works just like you might expect:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>variant</span><span>&lt;</span><span>string</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>bool</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>mySetting</span> <span>=</span> <span>string</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello!"</span><span>);</span> <span>// Or,
</span><span>mySetting</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span><span>;</span> <span>// Or,
</span><span>mySetting</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Once we put a value into a <code>variant</code>, we’ll eventually want to look at what that
value is, and just as importantly, what the type of the value is.
This is where the fun begins.
Some languages offer dedicated <em>pattern matching</em> syntax for the task,
such as:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>match</span> <span>(</span><span>theSetting</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Setting</span><span>::</span><span>Str</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"A string: {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Setting</span><span>::</span><span>Int</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"An integer: {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>n</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Setting</span><span>::</span><span>Bool</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"A boolean: {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>),</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>but this didn’t make the cut for C++17.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>
Instead we’re given a companion function called <code>std::visit</code>.
It takes the <code>variant</code> you want to examine, along with
some <em>visitor</em> that is callable for each type in the variant.</p>

<p>How do we define such a visitor?
One way is to create an object that overloads the call operator
for relevant types:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>SettingVisitor</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>operator</span><span>()(</span><span>const</span> <span>string</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>const</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"A string: %s</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>c_str</span><span>());</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>void</span> <span>operator</span><span>()(</span><span>const</span> <span>int</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>const</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"An integer: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>n</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>void</span> <span>operator</span><span>()(</span><span>const</span> <span>bool</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>const</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"A boolean: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This seems terribly verbose, and it gets even worse
if we want our visitor to capture or modify some other state.
Hmm—<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/7627218">lambdas</a> are perfect
for capturing state.
What if we could build a visitor from those?</p>
<div><pre><code><span>make_visitor</span><span>(</span>
    <span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>](</span><span>const</span> <span>string</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"string: %s</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>c_str</span><span>());</span>
        <span>// ...
</span>    <span>},</span>
    <span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>](</span><span>const</span> <span>int</span> <span>d</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"integer: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>d</span><span>);</span>
        <span>// ...
</span>    <span>},</span>
    <span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>](</span><span>const</span> <span>bool</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"bool: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>);</span>
        <span>// ...
</span>    <span>}</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>That’s a bit better, but the standard library doesn’t provide any sort of
<code>make_visitor</code> to combine the lambdas into a callable object for us.
We’ll need to define it ourselves.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span><span>...</span> <span>Fs</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>overload</span><span>;</span>

<span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>F0</span><span>,</span> <span>class</span><span>...</span> <span>Frest</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>overload</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F0</span><span>,</span> <span>Frest</span><span>...</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span> <span>F0</span><span>,</span> <span>overload</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Frest</span><span>...</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>overload</span><span>(</span><span>F0</span> <span>f0</span><span>,</span> <span>Frest</span><span>...</span> <span>rest</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>F0</span><span>(</span><span>f0</span><span>),</span> <span>overload</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Frest</span><span>...</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>rest</span><span>...)</span> <span>{}</span>

    <span>using</span> <span>F0</span><span>::</span><span>operator</span><span>();</span>
    <span>using</span> <span>overload</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Frest</span><span>...</span><span>&gt;::</span><span>operator</span><span>();</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>F0</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>overload</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F0</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span> <span>F0</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>overload</span><span>(</span><span>F0</span> <span>f0</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>F0</span><span>(</span><span>f0</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>

    <span>using</span> <span>F0</span><span>::</span><span>operator</span><span>();</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span><span>...</span> <span>Fs</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>auto</span> <span>make_visitor</span><span>(</span><span>Fs</span><span>...</span> <span>fs</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>overload</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Fs</span><span>...</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>fs</span><span>...);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Here we use C++11’s <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/parameter_pack">variadic templates</a>.
They must be defined recursively, so we create some base case <code>F0</code>,
then use that to define a cascading set of constructors for <code>overload</code>,
each of which peels off a lambda argument and adds it to the type
as a call operator.</p>

<p>If this seems troublesome, fear not! C++17 will offer a new syntax
that reduces all of the above to:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>template</span><span>&lt;</span><span>class</span><span>...</span> <span>Ts</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>struct</span> <span>overloaded</span> <span>:</span> <span>Ts</span><span>...</span> <span>{</span> <span>using</span> <span>Ts</span><span>::</span><span>operator</span><span>()...;</span> <span>};</span>
<span>template</span><span>&lt;</span><span>class</span><span>...</span> <span>Ts</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>overloaded</span><span>(</span><span>Ts</span><span>...)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>overloaded</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Ts</span><span>...</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Easy, right? But if don’t like any of these options, you could
use C++17’s compile-time conditionals instead:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>[](</span><span>auto</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>arg</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>using</span> <span>T</span> <span>=</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>decay_t</span><span>&lt;</span><span>decltype</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>constexpr</span> <span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>is_same_v</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>string</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"string: %s</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>arg</span><span>.</span><span>c_str</span><span>());</span>
        <span>// ...
</span>    <span>}</span>
    <span>else</span> <span>if</span> <span>constexpr</span> <span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>is_same_v</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"integer: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>arg</span><span>);</span>
        <span>// ...
</span>    <span>}</span>
    <span>else</span> <span>if</span> <span>constexpr</span> <span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>is_same_v</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>bool</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"bool: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>arg</span><span>);</span>
        <span>// ...
</span>    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Much better, no?</p>

<h2 id="no">No.</h2>

<p>The rigmarole needed for <code>std::visit</code> is entirely insane.
We started with a simple goal: look at the contents of a sum type.
To accomplish this meager mission, we had to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Define a function object, which requires a lot of
boilerplate, <em>or</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>Define our behavior with lambdas, which required:
    <ul>
      <li>An understanding of variadic templates, in all their recursively-defined fun, <em>or</em></li>
      <li>A familiarity with variadic <code>using</code> declarations, fresh on the scene from C++17.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>or</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>Use compile-time conditionals, which require you to know
about—and grok—the new <code><span>constexpr</span> <span>if</span></code> syntax, along with
<code>type_traits</code> fun like
<code>std::decay</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>None of these concepts are too enigmatic if you’re an experienced C++ developer,
but several are certainly “advanced” features of the language.
Things have really gone sideways if we need to know so much
to do something so simple.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-we-get-here">How did we get here?</h2>

<p>My goal isn’t to disparage the folks on the ISO C++ committee
who picked this approach.
I’ve had beers with some of them,
and they’re smart, kind, hardworking people.
I’m sure that I’m missing important context since I’ve never sat in on a
standards meeting or read all of the relevant
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/">committee papers</a>.
But from an outsider’s perspective, the disparity in complexity between the
problem being solved (“What’s in here?”)
and the solutions is just nuts.
How do you teach this without overwhelming a beginner with all this other…
stuff?
Is it expected to be common knowledge for your everyday programmer?
(And if the goal of adding <code>variant</code> to the standard library <em>isn’t</em> to
make it a tool for the masses, shouldn’t it be?)
The very least C++17 could do—if the committee didn’t have the time or resources
to get pattern matching into the language—is provide something akin to <code>make_visitor</code>.
But that too is left as an exercise for the user.</p>

<p>If I had to guess how we ended up this way,
I’d assume it comes down to confirmation bias.
Maybe when a bunch of really smart people who know how
<a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/sfinae">SFINAE</a> works offhand
and don’t flinch when they see the likes of</p>

<div><pre><code><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>typename</span> <span>F</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>typename</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>enable_if</span><span>&lt;!</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>is_reference</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F</span><span>&gt;::</span><span>value</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span><span>&gt;::</span><span>type</span>
<span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>F</span> <span>f</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>// ...
</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>get together, the result is something like <code>std::visit</code>.
Nobody proclaims that the emperor has no clothes, or that it’s completely
bonkers to expect the average user to build an overloaded callable
object with recursive templates just to see if the thing they’re looking at
holds an <code><span>int</span></code> or a <code><span>string</span></code>.</p>

<p>I’m also not here to claim that C++ is too complicated for its own good,
but it’s certainly more complicated than it has to be.
Scott Meyers, the guy who wrote <em>Effective&nbsp;C++</em> and <em>Effective Modern&nbsp;C++</em>,
has made similar noises in <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/47947981">recent</a>
<a href="https://youtu.be/RT46MpK39rQ?t=29m51s">talks</a>.
To paraphrase Meyers, I’m sure each member of the committee cares very much
about avoiding needless complexity and making the language easier to use.
But if you look at the results of their work, it’s hard to tell.
The accidental complexity just keeps stacking up.</p>

<h2 id="where-are-we-headed">Where are we headed?</h2>

<p>There’s a reason C++ is so widely used, especially in systems programming.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>
It can be incredibly expressive, yet gives you nearly full control of your hardware.
The tooling around it is some of the most mature of any programming language
out there, bar C.
It supports a ridiculous number of platforms.</p>

<p>But even if you set aside all the historical baggage, it has some serious shortcomings.
Spend any amount of time messing with D and you’ll quickly realize that
metaprogramming needn’t require self-flagellation and insane syntax.
Play with Rust and <!-- Hi, PCJ --> you’ll feel like <code>unique_ptr</code>
and <code>shared_ptr</code>—which themselves have been a breath of fresh air—are
a bad joke.
The fact that we still handle dependencies in 2017
by literally copy-pasting files into each other with <code><span>#include</span></code>
macros is <em>obscene</em>.</p>

<p>You get the impression, based on what ends up in the ISO standards and what
you hear in conference talks,
that those driving C++ are trying to eliminate some of these shortcomings by
glomming nice bits from other languages onto it.
That’s a great idea on its face,
but these features often seem to arrive half-baked.
While C++ isn’t going away any time soon,
it feels like the language is constantly playing a clumsy game of catchup.</p>

<hr>

<p>In spite of all of this,
I’ll be busy encouraging my coworkers to use <code>variant</code> if anybody needs me.
Sum types are such a useful concept that they’re worth the pain,
and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvtFGa6XJDU">to quote Jon Kalb</a>,
“If you can’t program in a language with ugly warts, maybe C++ isn’t the language
you should be programming in.”</p>

    <p>Constructing the MNIST-1D dataset. As with the original MNIST dataset, the task is to learn to classify the digits 0-9. Unlike the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 images, each of these examples is a one-dimensional sequence of points. To generate an example, we begin with 10 digit templates and then randomly pad, translate, add noise, and transform them as shown above.</p>
  	</div>
</div>





<p>By any scientific standard, the Human Genome Project <a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/62798">was enormous</a>: it involved billions of dollars of funding, dozens of institutions, and over a decade of accelerated research. But that was only the tip of the iceberg. Long before the project began, scientists were hard at work assembling the intricate science of human genetics. And most of the time, they were not studying humans. The foundational discoveries in genetics centered on far simpler organisms such as peas, molds, fruit flies, and mice. To this day, biologists use these simpler organisms as genetic “minimal working examples” in order to save time, energy, and money. A well-designed experiment with Drosophilia, such as <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10746727/">Feany and Bender (2000)</a>, can teach us an astonishing amount about humans.</p>

<p>The deep learning analogue of Drosophilia is the MNIST dataset. A large number of deep learning innovations including <a href="https://jmlr.org/papers/v15/srivastava14a.html">dropout</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980">Adam</a>, <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-89e.pdf">convolutional networks</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661">generative adversarial networks</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114">variational autoencoders</a> began life as MNIST experiments. Once these innovations proved themselves on small-scale experiments, scientists found ways to scale them to larger and more impactful applications.</p>

<p>They key advantage of Drosophilia and MNIST is that they dramatically accelerate the iteration cycle of exploratory research. In the case of Drosophilia, the fly’s life cycle is just a few days long and its nutritional needs are negligible. This makes it much easier to work with than mammals, especially humans. In the case of MNIST, training a strong classifier takes a few dozen lines of code, less than a minute of walltime, and negligible amounts of electricity. This is a stark contrast to state-of-the-art vision, text, and game-playing models which can take months and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08900">hundreds of thousands of dollars</a> of electricity to train.</p>

<p>Yet in spite of its historical significance, MNIST has three notable shortcomings. First, it does a poor job of differentiating between linear, nonlinear, and translation-invariant models. For example, logistic, MLP, and CNN benchmarks obtain 94, 99+, and 99+% accuracy on it. This makes it hard to measure the contribution of a CNN’s spatial priors or to judge the relative effectiveness of different regularization schemes. Second, it is somewhat large for a toy dataset. Each input example is a 784-dimensional vector and thus it takes a non-trivial amount of computation to perform hyperparameter searches or debug a metalearning loop. Third, MNIST is hard to hack. The ideal toy dataset should be procedurally generated so that researchers can smoothly vary parameters such as background noise, translation, and resolution.</p>

<p>In order to address these shortcomings, we propose the MNIST-1D dataset. It is a minimalist, low-memory, and low-compute alternative to MNIST, designed for exploratory deep learning research where rapid iteration is a priority. Training examples are 20 times smaller but they are still better at measuring the difference between 1) linear and nonlinear classifiers and 2) models with and without spatial inductive biases (eg. translation invariance). The dataset is procedurally generated but still permits analogies to real-world digit classification.</p>

The MNIST-1D plot, meanwhile, reveals a lack of well-defined clusters which suggests that learning a nonlinear representation of the data is much more important to achieve successful classification.

<h2 id="example-use-cases">Example use cases</h2>

<p>In this section we will explore several examples of how MNIST-1D can be used to study core “science of deep learning” phenomena.</p>

<p><strong>Finding lottery tickets.</strong> It is not unusual for deep learning models to have ten or even a hundred times more parameters than necessary. This overparameterization helps training but increases computational overhead. One solution is to progressively prune weights from a model during training so that the final network is just a fraction of its original size. Although this approach works, conventional wisdom holds that sparse networks do not train well from scratch. Recent work by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635">Frankle &amp; Carbin (2019)</a> challenges this conventional wisdom. The authors report finding sparse subnetworks inside of larger networks that train to equivalent or even higher accuracies. These “lottery ticket” subnetworks can be found through a simple iterative procedure: train a network, prune the smallest weights, and then rewind the remaining weights to their original initializations and retrain.</p>

<p>Since the original paper was published, a multitude of works have sought to explain this phenomenon and then harness it on larger datasets and models. However, very few works have attempted to isolate a “minimal working example” of this effect so as to investigate it more carefully. The figure below shows that the MNIST-1D dataset not only makes this possible, but also enables us to elucidate, via carefully-controlled experiments, some of the reasons for a lottery ticket’s success. Unlike many follow-up experiments on the lottery ticket, this one took just two days of researcher time to produce. The curious reader can also <a href="https://bit.ly/3nCEIaL">reproduce these results</a> in their browser in a few minutes.</p>

  </p>
  <p>Finding and analyzing lottery tickets. In <b>a-b)</b>, we isolate a "minimum viable example" of the effect. Recent work by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02773">Morcos et al (2019)</a> shows that lottery tickets can transfer between datasets. We wanted to determine whether spatial inductive biases played a role. So we performed a series of experiments: in <b>c)</b> we plot the asymptotic performance of a 92% sparse ticket. In <b>d)</b> we reverse all the 1D signals in the dataset, effectively preserving spatial structure but changing the location of individual datapoints. This is analogous to flipping an image upside down. Under this ablation, the lottery ticket continues to win.</p>
</div>

  <p><img src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/scaling-down/lottery_b1.png">
  </p>
  <p><img src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/scaling-down/lottery_b2.png">
  </p>
    <p>Next, in <b>e)</b> we permute the indices of the 1D signal, effectively removing spatial structure from the dataset. This ablation hurts lottery ticket performance significantly more, suggesting that part of the lottery ticket's performance can be attributed to a spatial inductive bias. Finally, in <b>f)</b> we keep the lottery ticket sparsity structure but initialize its weights with a different random seed. Contrary to results reported in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635">Frankle &amp; Carbin (2019)</a>, we see that our lottery ticket continues to outperform a dense baseline, aligning well with our hypothesis that the lottery ticket mask has a spatial inductive bias. In <b>g)</b>, we verify our hypothesis by measuring how often unmasked weights are adjacent to one another in the first layer of our model. The lottery ticket has many more adjacent weights than chance would predict, implying a local connectivity structure which helps gives rise to spatial biases.</p>

<p><strong>Observing deep double descent.</strong> Another intriguing property of neural networks is the “double descent” phenomenon. This phrase refers to a training regime where more data, model parameters, or gradient steps can actually <em>reduce</em> a model’s test accuracy<sup id="fnref:fn1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn1">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:fn2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn2">2</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:fn3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn3">3</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:fn4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn4">4</a></sup>. The intuition is that during supervised learning there is an interpolation threshold where the learning procedure, consisting of a model and an optimization algorithm, is just barely able to fit the entire training set. At this threshold there is effectively just one model that can fit the data and this model is very sensitive to label noise and model mis-specification.</p>

<p>Several properties of this effect, such as what factors affect its width and location, are not well understood in the context of deep models. We see the MNIST-1D dataset as a good tool for exploring these properties. In fact, we were able to reproduce the double descent pattern after a few hours of researcher effort. The figure below shows our results for a fully-connected network and a convolutional model. We also observed a nuance that we had not seen mentioned in previous works: when using a mean square error loss, the interpolation threshold lies at \(n * K\) model parameters where \(n\) is the number of training examples and \(K\) is the number of model outputs. But when using a negative log likelihood loss, the interpolation threshold lies at \(n\) model parameters – it does not depend on the number of model outputs. This is an interesting empirical observation that may explain some of the advantage in using a log likelihood loss over a MSE loss on this type of task. You can reproduce these results <a href="https://bit.ly/2UBWWNu">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>05/12/2020</strong></p>

<p>TLDR: use <code>gen_random_uuid</code> to generate v4 uuids.</p>

<p>There are two main functions to generate v4 uuids in postgres, <code>uuid_generate_v4</code> and <code>gen_random_uuid</code>. In postgres 13, <code>gen_random_uuid</code> is a built in function. Otherwise you will need to install the <code>pgcrypto</code> extension. <code>uuid_generate_v4</code> requires the <code>uuid-ossp</code> extension. Depending how postgres is configured, postgres may actually use different libraries for the <code>uuid-ossp</code> extension (ossp-uuid, libc, libuuid) see <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/uuid-ossp.html">postgres doc</a> for more info.</p>

<h2 id="tests">Tests</h2>

<pre><code>CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "pgcrypto";
</code></pre>

<pre><code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT uuid_generate_v4() FROM generate_series(1, 10000);
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT gen_random_uuid() FROM generate_series(1, 10000);
</code></pre>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>All benchmarks used postgres 12.x.</li>
  <li>On windows, postgres was installed using https://www.enterprisedb.com.</li>
  <li>On linux, postgres was installed using respective package managers.</li>
  <li>All tests were done on google cloud VMs.

      <li>e2-standard-4: (4 vCPUs, 16 GB, HDD)</li>

  </li>
</ul>

      <td>windows-server-2019</td>
      <td>4400ms</td>
      <td>5ms</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>More investigation is required to determine why <code>uuid_generate_v4()</code> is so slow on windows server. It’s unclear what underlying lib the enterprisedb postgres is using for <code>uuid-ossp</code>. Regardless of why it’s slow on windows server, the best option for now is to use <code>gen_random_uuid</code> which is significantly faster on all platforms tested and comes built in on postgres 13.</p>

<p><strong>update</strong></p>

<p>To be sure the windows issue was not limited to the edb postgres 12.4 version, I did one quick benchmark on the latest edb postgres 13 and found similar execution times for uuid_generate_v4.</p>

<p>If you’re using PiHole on your network to block ads and prevent your various smart devices from sending tracking information to their manufacturers, <strong>you might be surprised to find out that some of these devices are using a sneaky tactic to bypass your PiHole entirely.</strong></p>
<p>Smart devices manufacturers often “hard-code” in a public DNS server, like Google’s 8.8.8.8, and their devices ignore whatever DNS server is assigned by your router - such as your PiHole.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08288.pdf">Nearly 70% of smart TVs and 46% of game consoles</a> were found to contain hardcoded DNS settings - allowing them to simply ignore your local network’s DNS server entirely.

</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> pfSense (and most other firewalls) process rules from top to bottom. Make sure you drag the second rule exempting PiHole from DNS query redirects <em>above</em> the first rule we created - otherwise PiHole will not be able to contact external DNS servers.</p>
<p><strong>NAT Rule 3: Prevent clients from giving unexpected source errors</strong></p>
<p>Finally, we need to create an outbound NAT rule. Navigate to <em>Firewall</em> &gt; <em>NAT</em> &gt; <em>Outbound</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interface:</strong> LAN</li>
<li><strong>Address Family:</strong> IPv4+IPv6</li>
<li><strong>Protocol:</strong> any</li>
<li><strong>Source - Type:</strong> Network</li>
<li><strong>Source - Network for the outbound NAT mapping:</strong> Your internal LAN network</li>
<li><strong>Destination - Type:</strong> Network</li>
<li><strong>Destination - Network for the outbound NAT Mappings:</strong> Your PiHole’s IP Address</li>
<li><strong>Destination Port Range:</strong> 53</li>
<li><strong>Translation:</strong> Interface Address</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Prevents hardcoded DNS clients from giving unexpected source error after DNS redirected to PiHole.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="test-it-out">Test it out</h3>
<p>You can easily test to make sure your DNS redirection is working properly.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new, temporary internal DNS entry on your network (“piholetest.example.com”), and point it to 10.0.1.1. You can do this right from PiHole under <em>Local DNS Records</em>.</li>
<li>Manually set your computer’s DNS server to <em>1.1.1.1</em>.</li>
<li>Open a terminal window (or command promt on Windows), and run <code>nslookup piholetest.example.com</code></li>
<li>
<p>If you set this up correctly, <code>nslookup</code> should return 10.0.1.1. Your computer <em>thinks</em> it’s receiving DNS records from 1.1.1.1, while in reality they are coming from your PiHole.</p>
<div><div><pre><code> macbookpro:~ labzilla$ nslookup piholetest.example.com
 Server:		1.1.1.1
 Address:	1.1.1.1#53
	
 Name:	piholetest.example.com
 Address: 10.0.1.1
</code></pre></div> </div>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can further demonstate this by temporarily disabling the first NAT rule we created, and running the same <code>nslookup piholetest.example.com</code> command:</p>
<div><div><pre><code> macbookpro:~ labzilla$ nslookup piholetest.example.com
 Server:		1.1.1.1
 Address:	1.1.1.1#53
	
 ** server can't find piholetest.example.com: NXDOMAIN 
</code></pre></div> </div>
<p>As “piholetest.example.com” doesn’t exist on the public Internet, the real 1.1.1.1 server has no record to provide - resulting in your <code>nslookup</code> request returning a NXDOMAIN error.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Don’t forget to revert your computer’s DNS settings back to their original value, and reenable any firewall rules you temporary disabled while testing.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
  <p>If you were using computers in the ‘90s and the early 2000s, you probably had the experience of installing a piece of software you downloaded from the internet, only to discover that someone put some nasty into it, and now you’re dragging your computer to IT to beg them to save your data. To remedy this, software developers started “signing” their software in a way that proved both who they were and that nobody tampered with the software after they released it. Every major operating system now supports code or application signature verification, and it’s a backbone of every app store.But what about Kubernetes? How do we know that our Docker images aren’t secret bitcoin miners, stealing traffic away from customers to make somebody rich? That’s where Binary Authorization comes in. It’s a way to apply the code signing and verification that modern systems now rely on to the cloud. Coupled with Voucher, an open source project started by my team at Shopify, we’ve created a way to prevent malicious software from being installed without making developers miserable or forcing them to learn cryptography.</p>
<h2>Why Block Untrusted Applications?</h2>
<p>Your personal or work computer getting compromised is a huge deal! Your personal data being stolen or your computer becoming unusable due to popup ads or background processes doing tasks you don’t know about is incredibly upsetting.</p>
<p>But imagine if you used a compromised service. Imagine if your email host ran in Docker containers in a cluster with a malicious service that wanted to access contents of the email databases? This isn’t just your data, but the data of everyone around you.</p>
<p>This is something we care about deeply at Shopify, since trust is a core component of our relationship with our merchants and our merchants’ relationships with their customers. This is why Binary Authorization has been a priority for Shopify since our move to Kubernetes.</p>
<h2>What is Code Signing?</h2>
<p>Code signing starts by taking a hash of your application. Hashes are made with hashing algorithms that take the contents of something (such as the binary code that makes up an application) and make a short, reproducible value that represents that version. A part of the appeal of hashing algorithms is that it takes an almost insurmountable amount of work (provided you’re using newer algorithms) to find two pieces of data that produce the same hash value.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a file that has the text:</p>
<p><code>Hello World</code></p>
<p>The hash representation of that (using the “sha256” hashing algorithm) is:</p>
<p><code>d2a84f4b8b650937ec8f73cd8be2c74add5a911ba64df27458ed8229da804a26</code></p>
<p>Adding an exclamation mark to the end of our file:</p>
<p><code>Hello World!</code></p>
<p>Results in a completely different hash:</p>
<p><code>03ba204e50d126e4674c005e04d82e84c21366780af1f43bd54a37816b6ab340</code></p>
<p>Once you have a hash of an application, you can run the same hashing algorithm on it to ensure that it hasn’t changed. While this is an important part of the code signing, most signing applications will automatically create a hash of what you are signing, rather than requiring you to hash and then sign the hash separately. It makes the hash creation and verification transparent to the developers and their users.</p>
<p>Once the initial release is ready, the developer that’s signing the application creates a public and private key for signing it, and shares the public key with their future users. The developer then uses the private part of their signing key and the hash of the application to create a value that can be verified with the public part of the key.</p>
<p>For example, with Minisign, a tool for creating signatures quickly, first we create our signing key:</p>

<p>The public half of the key is now:</p>
<p><code>RWSs3jHbeTsmYhWlyqpDEufCe5QSGHsb1fFnglZItPwDfJ3wEZzSGyBJ</code></p>
<p>And the private half remains private, living in&nbsp;<code>/Users/caj/.minisign/minisign.key</code>.</p>
<p>Now, if our application was named “hello” we can create a signature with that private key:</p>

<p>And then your users could verify that “hello” hasn’t been tampered with by running:</p>

<p>Unless you’re a software developer or power user, you likely have never consciously verified a signature, but that’s what’s happening behind the scenes if you’re using a modern operating system.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Where is Code Signing Used?</h2>
<p>Two of the biggest users of code signing are Apple and Google. They use code signing to ensure that you don’t accidentally install software updates that have been tampered with or malicious apps from the internet. Signatures are usually verified in the background, and you only get notified if something is wrong. In Android, you can turn this off by <a href="https://developer.android.com/distribute/marketing-tools/alternative-distribution.html" target="_blank" title="Alternative distribution options - Android Developer" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">allowing unknown apps in the phone's settings</a>, whereas iOS requires the device be jailbroken to allow unsigned applications to be installed.</p>
<p><img alt="A macOS dialog window showing that Firefox is damaged and can't be opened. It gives users the option of moving it to the Trash." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/FirefoxMessage.jpg?v=1606786217" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/FirefoxMessage.jpg?v=1606786217"></p>
<p><br><em>A macOS dialog window showing that Firefox is damaged and can't be opened. It gives users the option of moving it to the Trash.</em></p>
<p>In macOS, applications that are missing their developer signatures or don’t have valid signatures are blocked by the operating system and advise users to move them to the Trash.</p>
<p>Most Linux package managers, (such as Apt/DPKG in Debian and Ubuntu, Pacman in ArchLinux) use code signing to ensure that you’re installing packages from the distribution maintainer, and verify those packages at install time.</p>
<p><img alt="Docker Hub showing a docker image created by the author." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/DockerImage.jpg?v=1606786314" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/DockerImage.jpg?v=1606786314"><br><em>Docker Hub showing a docker image created by the author.</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, Kubernetes doesn’t have this by default. There are features that allow you to leverage code signing, but chances are you haven’t used them.</p>
<p>And at the end of the day, do you really trust some rando on the internet to actually give you a container that does what it says it does? Do you want to trust that for your organization? Your customers?</p>
<h2>What is Binary Authorization?</h2>
<p>Binary Authorization is a series of components that work together:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>A metadata service: a service that stores signatures and other image metadata</li>
<li>A Binary Authorization Enforcer: a service that blocks images that it can’t find valid signatures for</li>
<li>A signing service: a system that signs new images and stores those signatures in the metadata service.</li>
</ul>
<p>Google provides the first two services for their Kubernetes servers, which Shopify uses, based on two open source projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grafeas, a metadata service</li>
<li>Kritis, a Binary Authorization Enforcer</li>
</ul>
<p>When using Kritis and Grafeas or the Binary Authorization feature in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), infrastructure developers will configure policies for their clusters, listing the keys (also referred to as attestors) that must have signed the container images before they can run.</p>
<p>When new resources are started in a Kubernetes cluster, the images they reference are sent to the Binary Authorization Enforcer. The Enforcer connects to the metadata service to verify the existence of valid signatures for the image in question and then compares those signatures to the policy for the cluster it runs in. If the image doesn’t have the required signatures, it’s blocked, and any containers that would use it won’t start.You can see how these two systems work together to provide the same security that one gets in one’s operating system! However, there’s one piece that wasn’t provided by Google until recently: the signing service.</p>
<h2>Voucher: The Missing Piece</h2>
<p>Voucher serves as the last piece for Binary Authorization, the signing service. Voucher allows Shopify to run security checks against our Docker images and sign them depending on how secure they are, without requiring that non-security teams manage their signing keys.</p>
<p><img alt="Using Voucher's client software to check an image with the 'is_shopify' check, which verifies if the image was from a Shopify owned repository." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/ImageApproved.jpg?v=1606786428" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/ImageApproved.jpg?v=1606786428"><br><em>Using Voucher's client software to check an image with the 'is_shopify' check, which verifies if the image was from a Shopify owned repository.</em></p>
<p>The way it works is simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Voucher runs in Google Cloud Run or Kubernetes and is accessible as a REST endpoint</li>
<li>Every build pipeline automatically calls to Voucher with the path to the image it built</li>
<li>Voucher reviews the image, signs it, and pushes that signature to the metadata service</li>
</ol>
<p>On top of the basic code signing workflow discussed previously, Voucher also supports validating more complicated requirements, using separate security checks and associated signing keys to mix and match required signatures on a per cluster basis to create distinct policies based on a cluster’s requirement.</p>
<p>For example, do you want to block images that weren’t built internally? Voucher has a distinct check for verifying that an image is associated with a Git commit in a Github repo you own, and signing those images with a separate key.</p>
<p>Alternatively, do you need to be able to prove that every change was approved by multiple people? Voucher can support that, creating signatures based on the existence of approvals in Github (with support for other code hosting services coming soon). This would allow you to use Binary Authorization to block images that would violate that requirement.</p>
<p>Voucher also has support for verifying the identity of the container builder, blocking images with a high number of vulnerabilities, and so on. And Voucher was designed to be extensible, allowing for the creation of new checks as need be.By combining Voucher’s checks and Binary Authorization policies, infrastructure teams can create a layered approach to securing their organization’s Kubernetes clusters. Compliance clusters can be configured to require approvals and block images with vulnerabilities, while clusters for experiments and staging can use less strict policies to allow developers to move faster, all with minimum work from non-security focused developers.</p>
<h2>Voucher Joins Grafeas</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Voucher serves a need that hasn’t been provided by Google <i>until recently</i>. This is because <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/introducing-voucher-service-help-secure-container-supply-chain" target="_blank" title="Introducing Voucher, a service to help secure the container supply chain" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Voucher has moved into the Grafeas organization</a> and now is a service provided by Google to Google Kubernetes Engine users going forwards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since our move to Kubernetes, Shopify’s security team has been working with Google’s Binary Authorization team to plan out how we’ll roll out Binary Authorization and design Voucher. We also released Voucher as an open source project in December 2018. This move to the Grafeas …</p></div></div>

Muhammed Abiodun / Unsplash"></a><figcaption>(Muhammed Abiodun / Unsplash)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Slack’s life as an underdog darling of Silicon Valley ended on November 2, 2016. That’s when the upstart communication startup <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13497766/slack-microsoft-teams-new-york-times-ad">published an open letter to Microsoft in the </a><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13497766/slack-microsoft-teams-new-york-times-ad">New York Times</a></em>, offering the tech giant an insincere “welcome” to the world of workplace chat software. The occasion was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/25/13405200/microsoft-teams-slack-competitor-launch">Microsoft’s launch of Teams</a>, a Slack clone that would come bundled with the company’s popular Office 365 suite of products.</p><p>In its letter, Slack warned Microsoft that “Slack is here to stay,” adding: “we’re just getting started.” But the 4 million users it had at the time would increase to just 12 million four years later, while Microsoft — which added Teams to its 365 bundle without increasing the price — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537286/microsoft-teams-115-million-daily-active-users-stats">took Teams from zero to 115 million users</a>. </p><p>That disparity helps to explain why <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/technology/salesforce-slack-deal.html">Slack sold itself this week to Salesforce</a>. The deal, which values Slack at $27.7 billion on revenues of $833 million over the past year, has largely been greeted with cheers. (Ben Thompson <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/salesforce-acquires-slack-salesforces-reasoning-salesforces-opportunity/">offers a typically excellent rundown of the opportunity here for both Salesforce and Slack</a>.)</p><p>But it also feels like the end of an era — one where workers gained new power to bring their own tools to the office, and decide for themselves how they wanted to get work done. Slack first succeeded with small teams who wanted to accelerate their work, and was often dragged into organizations by early adopters. But today, waves of consolidation are leaving people with fewer real choices.</p><p>The rise of smart phones in the early 2010s brought with it a new surge of workplace productivity tools that made mincemeat of everything that had come before them. Box and Dropbox brought easy file storage and sharing. Evernote introduced the idea of ubiquitous, cloud-synchronized note-taking. Sunrise created a more social calendar, while Mailbox and Acompli reimagined email for the mobile phone.</p><p>Slack tiptoed into the conversation in the middle of the decade, and almost immediately became the fastest-growing enterprise software tool of all time. In 2015, just 18 months after it launched, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/24/8836087/slack-1-million-daily-users">Slack reported having more than 1 million daily users</a> —&nbsp;a figure then unheard-of in enterprise software.</p><p>It had a great backstory —&nbsp;a last-ditch pivot from a failed video game called Glitch —&nbsp;and, in Stewart Butterfield, one of the tech world’s most charming founders. It also had a bold pitch: it was going to “kill email” —&nbsp;or, at the very least, reduce your reliance on it. And it would do so by integrating hundreds of other services into real-time work chat, creating a kind of all-knowing command console for your organization.</p><p>The company embodied the belief, so common in Silicon Valley, that the best product would win in the end. “Building a product that allows for significant improvements in how people communicate requires a degree of thoughtfulness and craftsmanship that is not common in the development of enterprise software,” the company wrote in its open letter to Microsoft. “How far you go in helping companies truly transform to take advantage of this shift in working is even more important than the individual software features you are duplicating.”</p><p>And yet if there’s a lesson of the past four years, it’s that thoughtfulness and craftsmanship only got the company about 10 percent as far as Microsoft did by copy-pasting Slack’s basic design. In its open letter, Slack famously told Microsoft: “You’ve got to do this with love.” In 2020, looking at Slack’s size, the idea seems laughable. What’s love got to do with it?</p><p>The thing is, I <em>hate</em> that this was the outcome for Slack. I love good productivity tools, and was rooting for Slack to someday become as good as the company hyped it up to be. (And perhaps it still will: like most giants Salesforce has a mixed track record when it comes to the success of its acquisitions, but some seem to be thriving. When I asked about this on Twitter, people had <a href="https://twitter.com/caseynewton/status/1333891286185644032?s=21">a lot of good things to say about post-acquisition Heroku</a>.)</p><p>But Slack’s struggle to succeed as an independent company sadly mirrors that of many one-time innovators in enterprise productivity. Mailbox died and Acompli sold to Microsoft, where it became the mobile Outlook app. Evernote is a pale shadow of its former self. Of that early cohort, only Box and Dropbox became — and still remain —&nbsp;public companies.</p><p>Why is this the case? To get some insight, I called up Aaron Levie, Box’s affable CEO. In Levie’s telling —&nbsp;and he also wrote <a href="https://blog.box.com/salesforce-slack-and-future-work">a blog post about the Slack sale</a> — it all comes down to sales. The idea that workers would someday choose all their own tools was always a fantasy, he told me, in part because most workers don’t event want to think about their tools. In such a world, the winning app will almost always be one with a giant, er, salesforce behind it. </p><p>Microsoft had one. Slack didn’t. Enter Salesforce.</p><p>“The reality with the enterprise is that you can have the best product, but that’s not good enough,” Levie told me. “You need distribution. And what Salesforce has — they have the procurement officers, they have the finance people. They have all of the apparatus you need to interact with to sell software, and they have it for the top 100,000 corporations around the world.”</p><p>Levie is bullish on the acquisition, because it puts Slack and Salesforce on more even ground. </p><p>“The only advantage Microsoft has is distribution, and so now they’ve neutralized the advantage that Microsoft has had,” he said. “All of a sudden, they can actually fulfill the ultimate promise of the opportunity, because they have 10 times the amount of salespeople that can go distribute this thing into corporations around the world.”</p><p>Assuming Levie is right — and I wouldn’t bet against him — that means the medium-term future of work is increasingly a choice between three giants: Microsoft, Salesforce, and (in a distant third) Google. And with that, the golden age of worker choice in productivity tools seems to be coming to an end.</p><p>That’s not to say that the incumbents won’t always face new challengers. But I wonder whether the low ceiling that Slack turned out to have has implications for some of the other fast-growing productivity companies of the current moment. Should Slack’s sale diminish our expectations for Airtable, or Notion, or Coda? Don’t get me wrong — I’m confident their investors will all get their money back, and then some. But do they have a real future outside the arms of a monolith?</p><p>If not, then the productivity market will become as consolidated as any number of other spaces on the internet, from app stores to search engines to social networks. And as our government antitrust regulators begin to awaken after a long period of hibernation, I wonder if they’ll have anything to say about it.</p><h3>The Ratio</h3><p><em>Today in news that could affect public perception of the big tech companies</em></p><p>⬆️ <strong>Trending up</strong>: <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-news-showcase-paywalled-stories/">Google</a></strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-news-showcase-paywalled-stories/">’s new paid deals with publishers mean that access to some paywalled content will now be available to readers for free</a>.

<p>If you’re using PiHole on your network to block ads and prevent your various smart devices from sending tracking information to their manufacturers, <strong>you might be surprised to find out that some of these devices are using a sneaky tactic to bypass your PiHole entirely.</strong></p>
<p>Smart devices manufacturers often “hard-code” in a public DNS server, like Google’s 8.8.8.8, and their devices ignore whatever DNS server is assigned by your router - such as your PiHole.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08288.pdf">Nearly 70% of smart TVs and 46% of game consoles</a> were found to contain hardcoded DNS settings - allowing them to simply ignore your local network’s DNS server entirely. On average, Smart TVs generate an average of 60 megabytes of outgoing Internet traffic <em>per day</em>, all the while bypassing tools like PiHole.</p>
<h2 id="force-all-dns-queries-through-pihole">Force all DNS queries through PiHole</h2>
<p>Fortunately, with a few simple firewall rules, you can intercept these hardcoded DNS queries and redirect them to your PiHole. These instructions are for pfSense, however you should be able to adapt them for Sophos XG, Ubiquiti EdgeRouter, etc.</p>
<h3 id="create-nat-rules">Create NAT Rules</h3>
<p>Log in to your pfSense admin interface, and navigate to <em>Firewall</em> &gt; <em>NAT</em> &gt; <em>Port Forward</em>.</p>
<p>We’re going to create two Port Forward NAT rules - one to redirect any DNS queries originating from devices on the LAN to PiHole, and another to allow PiHole to commmunicate with external DNS servers. We will also create an additional outbound NAT rule that will make this process invisible to any clients on the network with hardcoded DNS.</p>
<p><strong>NAT Rule 1: Redirect DNS queries to PiHole</strong></p>
<p>Click the <em>Add</em> button to create your first new NAT Port Forward rule.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interface:</strong> LAN</li>
<li><strong>Protcol:</strong> TCP/UDP</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> LAN net (you may need to click the blue show advanced button to see this option)</li>
<li><strong>Destination - Invert match:</strong> Checked</li>
<li><strong>Destination - Type:</strong> Single host or alias</li>
<li><strong>Destination - Address/mask:</strong> Your PiHole’s IP address</li>
<li><strong>Destination Port Range - From:</strong> DNS</li>
<li><strong>Destination Port Range - To:</strong> DNS</li>
<li><strong>Redirect Target IP:</strong> Your PiHole’s IP address</li>
<li><strong>Redirect Target Port:</strong> DNS</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Intercept any outgoing DNS queries and redirect them to PiHole.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NAT Rule 2: Exempt PiHole from DNS query redirects</strong></p>
<p>Click the <em>Add</em> button to create your second new NAT Port Forward rule.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No RDR (NOT):</strong> Checked</li>
<li><strong>Interface:</strong> LAN</li>
<li><strong>Protcol:</strong> TCP/UDP</li>
<li><strong>Source - Type:</strong> Single host or alias</li>
<li><strong>Source - Address/Mask:</strong> Your PiHole’s IP address</li>
<li><strong>Destination:</strong> Any</li>
<li><strong>Destination Port Range - From:</strong> DNS</li>
<li><strong>Destination Port Range - From:</strong> DNS</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Allow PiHole to reach external DNS servers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> pfSense (and most other firewalls) process rules from top to bottom. Make sure you drag the second rule exempting PiHole from DNS query redirects <em>above</em> the first rule we created - otherwise PiHole will not be able to contact external DNS servers.</p>
<p><strong>NAT Rule 3: Prevent clients from giving unexpected source errors</strong></p>
<p>Finally, we need to create an outbound NAT rule. Navigate to <em>Firewall</em> &gt; <em>NAT</em> &gt; <em>Outbound</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interface:</strong> LAN</li>
<li><strong>Address Family:</strong> IPv4+IPv6</li>
<li><strong>Protocol:</strong> any</li>
<li><strong>Source - Type:</strong> Network</li>
<li><strong>Source - Network for the outbound NAT mapping:</strong> Your internal LAN network</li>
<li><strong>Destination - Type:</strong> Network</li>
<li><strong>Destination - Network for the outbound NAT Mappings:</strong> Your PiHole’s IP Address</li>
<li><strong>Destination Port Range:</strong> 53</li>
<li><strong>Translation:</strong> Interface Address</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Prevents hardcoded DNS clients from giving unexpected source error after DNS redirected to PiHole.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="test-it-out">Test it out</h3>
<p>You can easily test to make sure your DNS redirection is working properly.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new, temporary internal DNS entry on your network (“piholetest.example.com”), and point it to 10.0.1.1. You can do this right from PiHole under <em>Local DNS Records</em>.</li>
<li>Manually set your computer’s DNS server to <em>1.1.1.1</em>.</li>
<li>Open a terminal window (or command promt on Windows), and run <code>nslookup piholetest.example.com</code></li>
<li>
<p>If you set this up correctly, <code>nslookup</code> should return 10.0.1.1. Your computer <em>thinks</em> it’s receiving DNS records from 1.1.1.1, while in reality they are coming from your PiHole.</p>
<div><div><pre><code> macbookpro:~ labzilla$ nslookup piholetest.example.com
 Server:		1.1.1.1
 Address:	1.1.1.1#53
	
 Name:	piholetest.example.com
 Address: 10.0.1.1
</code></pre></div> </div>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can further demonstate this by temporarily disabling the first NAT rule we created, and running the same <code>nslookup piholetest.example.com</code> command:</p>
<div><div><pre><code> macbookpro:~ labzilla$ nslookup piholetest.example.com
 Server:		1.1.1.1
 Address:	1.1.1.1#53
	
 ** server can't find piholetest.example.com: NXDOMAIN 
</code></pre></div> </div>
<p>As “piholetest.example.com” doesn’t exist on the public Internet, the real 1.1.1.1 server has no record to provide - resulting in your <code>nslookup</code> request returning a NXDOMAIN error.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Don’t forget to revert your computer’s DNS settings back to their original value, and reenable any firewall rules you temporary disabled while testing.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Out of all Lisps the ones I’ve come to appreciate the most are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)">Scheme</a> and <a href="https://common-lisp.net/">Common
Lisp</a>. <!--break-->These two languages are fundamentally very different: Scheme
is a minimalist language built on the foundations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">lambda calculus</a>, while
Common Lisp is a multi-paradigm synthesis of many Lisps before it. Common Lisp
is a large standard with many implementations, Scheme is a collection of an
evolving but minimalistic standard with many implementations. The core of Scheme
is quite small compared to Common Lisp. The latest standard <a href="http://www.r6rs.org/final/r6rs-lib.pdf">R6RS</a> is about 65
pages, while the ANSI Common Lisp standard from 1994 is about 1100 pages. The
<a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/">Scheme Requests for Implementation</a> process aims to standardize additional
features (like <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-64/srfi-64.html">test suites</a>) that implementations may implement.</p>

<p>Common Lisp has some wonderful features, <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/beyond-exception-handling-conditions-and-restarts.html">conditions and restarts</a>, the <a href="https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/clos.html">Common
Lisp Object System (CLOS)</a>, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html">the macro system</a>, among many other things. The <a href="http://joaotavora.github.io/sly/">SLY
IDE for Emacs</a> is <em>amazing</em>, and the <a href="http://www.sbcl.org/">Steel Bank Common Lisp</a> compiler is really
great. It has <a href="https://www.quicklisp.org/index.html">Quicklisp</a> and <a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/">ASDF</a> for package and build management,
respectively. I find the developer experience of Common Lisp to be superior to
almost anything imaginable, and this is not an empty statement: having used all
sorts of IDEs and editors for over 25 years, I have seen <em>many</em>.</p>

<h3 id="tastes-differ">Tastes differ</h3>

<p>That said, Common Lisp is <em>weird</em>. What I find particularly jarring is that
functions and variables live in different namespaces: if you put a function into
a variable, you can’t just use it like a function, you have to <code>funcall</code> it.
Having programmed in lots of languages of the ML family this is just, well, odd;
but this is due to historical reasons and there are <a href="http://www.nhplace.com/kent/Papers/Technical-Issues.html">sound technical reasons for
it</a>.  There are other
oddities, some strange things like <code>(cdr '())</code> is not an error (in Scheme it
is), <code>()</code> and <code>nil</code> are equal (in Scheme <code>#f</code> and <code>()</code> are separate things), and
so on.</p>

<p>This isn’t really a fault in Common Lisp: other languages have impacted my taste
and preferences to bias me in the direction of Scheme, but that is not to say I
cannot work with Common Lisp’s idiosyncracies. Actually, I don’t mind them, I
just <em>notice</em> them.</p>

<p>I like the naming styles of Scheme more, as well. It has <code>string?</code> vs <code>string-p</code>
for predicate functions, <code>set!</code>  for state modifying functions, <code>foo-&gt;bar</code> for
conversions, these make code quite easier to read. Scheme has hygienic macros,
Guile has the traditional <code>defmacro</code> as well.</p>

<p>Many nice Scheme features are available in Common Lisp libraries. Pattern match
is available in the <a href="https://github.com/guicho271828/trivia">trivia</a> library. Named lets are easy to implement with a macro.</p>

<p>Common Lisp aficionados are quick to point out things Scheme <em>doesn’t</em> have:
keyword arguments, docstrings, rest arguments, but my Scheme implementation of
choice Guile has these built into the language.</p>

<h3 id="productivity-matters">Productivity matters</h3>

<p>Guile is in a strange niche is that its primary <em>raison d’être</em> is to be an
extension language for the GNU project. Like Emacs Lisp is for extending Emacs,
Guile is the <em>de facto</em> language for GNU programs for extension and scripting.</p>

<p>Guile doesn’t have Quicklisp and its package manager and build system is
basically nonexistent for the first and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/">Autoconf</a> for the second. There is
<a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/guile-user/2017-03/msg00168.html">sentiment</a> in the Guile community to have <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">Guix</a> as the package manager for
Guile. This might sound a bit onerous, since Guix is also a complete package
management for many other things than Guile, but consider this: as Andy Wingo
points out in his message that Guile libraries often come with C extensions,
Guile packages need some sort of managed build system for building the C
extensions. Since it doesn’t have one, to solve the problem of building a
package manager you’d also have to build a build system that can manage C code
and packages needed by the C code bits. To do this elegantly is a gargantuan
task, for instance, <a href="https://wiki.call-cc.org/man/5/Extensions#installing-eggs-that-use-libraries">chicken-install just asks you to put compiler/linker flags
on the command line before calling it</a>, so it obviously is a hard problem.</p>

<p>Now, Guix solves all that, and more, in a manner that is quite elegant and
interesting. But it’s not as lightweight as something like Quicklisp or
<a href="https://wiki.call-cc.org/man/5/Extensions"><code>chicken-install</code></a> from <a href="http://call-cc.org/">CHICKEN Scheme</a>. What is more, Guix works only on GNU/Linux
systems really, so macOS and Windows users won’t be able to do use your library
if you plan on distributing it via Guix. Duh, it’s the GNU project, but
portability is always nice.</p>

<p>But in Common Lisp I can write <code>(ql:quickload :alexandria)</code> and voilà, it will
automatically install the <a href="http://quickdocs.org/alexandria/">Alexandria</a> library that I can use. Then again, in
Common Lisp it’s somewhat rarer to have C extensions, so I don’t know how ASDF
handles that.</p>

<p>It is unfair to compare <a href="http://joaotavora.github.io/sly/">SLY</a> to <a href="https://www.nongnu.org/geiser/">Geiser</a>, the best Emacs Scheme integration
package.  SLY is based on <a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/">SLIME</a> which has <em>decades</em> of man-years of work behind
it. Geiser is able to support multiple Scheme implementations and it is quite
impressive in this regard. But SLY obviously has much more (e.g. an interactive
debugger). That said, Geiser has nice Guile support, and Guile is in general the
most Common Lisp-y of all Schemes, in fact, it has</p>

<ul>
  <li>an imitation of CLOS in the form of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/goops/">GOOPS</a></li>
  <li>docstrings and keyword, rest, and optional arguments for function
definitions</li>
  <li>an interactive REPL and a mutable top-level (unlike many Schemes)</li>
  <li>a nice module system</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/manual/html_node/Defmacros.html"><code>defmacro</code></a> and exceptions somewhat <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/manual/html_node/Raising-and-Handling-Exceptions.html">similar to Common Lisp restarts </a></li>
</ul>

<p>and some nice things Common Lisp doesn’t have like first-class
continuations. But then again I would use those rarely.</p>

<h3 id="when-would-i-pick-one-over-the-other">When would I pick one over the other?</h3>

<p>If I were to write an extensible C/C++/Rust program that I <em>know</em> will need to use
a low-level language, I might do the low level bits using a low level language
and then write the rest in Guile. Guile makes it very easy to spin up a REPL
socket to do something like <code>myprogram --repl=12345</code> that you can connect to, and
the interop between C and Guile is fantastic, it has to be, as it’s primarily an
extension language.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if were to build a wholly standalone application, the choice is
not as obvious. I could do the whole thing in either language. Common Lisp can
build native executables, although their size will be large (who cares?) since
the binary will include the whole Lisp implementation. Guile cannot compile to
native code so you’ll have to write a script executable, but that doesn’t really
matter.</p>

<p>Scenarios where I would pick Guile:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when I’m making an extensible program that has to have some C/C++ bits but I
want to make it scriptable by users</li>
  <li>when I want to write a native binary but not write too much C/C++ code</li>
  <li>I just want to write Scheme, because Scheme is a bit more elegant</li>
  <li>the project has something to do with the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/">GNU project</a></li>
</ul>

<p>On the other hand, Common Lisp makes the most sense if I just want to enjoy a
seriously rapid development experience, a large standard library and language,
and I don’t mind having 50MB binaries (again, who cares?) if I were to write
standalone programs. Guile can’t do that, but it’s easy to either write Guile
scripts or a C program that essentially bootstraps a binary to load a Scheme
runtime. This is how <a href="http://lilypond.org/">LilyPond</a> is written, for example.</p>

<p>So the answer to which one is decidedly <strong>both</strong>! Both languages are really fun to
write. At the moment I don’t do Lisp at my day job so it’s all for fun
anyway. If this were for professional purposes, I don’t know. Very often a
strict requirement for professional work is to be able to be productive. In that
regard I think Common Lisp has a significant edge, not only due to its superior
development experience, but its history as a real production language. There are
actual companies doing stuff in Common Lisp. I have not heard of any
professional (in the industrial sense) uses of Guile, notwithstanding that many
projects powered by Guile (Guix, etc.)  are <em>extremely</em> professional in the way
they are written and maintained. But Common Lisp has <em>more</em> libraries and
companies behind it.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-clojure">What about Clojure?</h3>

<p>I’ve actually had the pleasure to use Clojure for personal fun, and a little bit
of professional use. I wrote a couple of libraries (<a href="https://github.com/ane/vigil">vigil</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ane/task">task</a>) and my
experience with has always been positive and its development experience is
excellent. Clojure isn’t a true Lisp, or well, it is part of the <em>Lisp
family</em>. Its ability to interface with the JVM makes it easy to leverage the
thousands of JVM libraries out there.</p>

<p>I’d gladly do it again, though I feel that Common Lisp with CLOS and its module
system makes it somewhat easier to practice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_in_the_large_and_programming_in_the_small"><em>programming in the large</em></a>. Clojure
explores interesting territories with <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/spec">spec</a>, so it is interesting to see what
direction the language will take in the future.</p>

<h3 id="final-words-emacs-lisp">Final words: Emacs Lisp</h3>

<p>There’s also a parenthetical elephant in the room here: Emacs Lisp! An old
descendant of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maclisp">MacLisp</a>, it’s actually quite fun to write, and the fact that Emacs
itself is the interpreter, you have superb introspectability for any Elisp
code. Most of the Lisp I write these days is probably Emacs Lisp. It’s very
close to Common Lisp. <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/cl.html#Overview">cl-lib</a> adds a sufficient amount of convenience from
Common Lisp to make Elisp writing quite enjoyable. <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eieio.html#Top">EIEIO</a> adds a subset of CLOS
that can be used seamlessly with cl-lib. The condition system is missing.</p>

<p>I’ve also done a fair bit of <a href="https://fennel-lang.org/">Fennel</a>, a Lisp that compiles to Lua. I used it to
write a <a href="https://github.com/ane/mudrally">small game</a> and it was fun to write since you could develop the game in a
REPL.</p>

<p>All in all, Lisp in all its variants is the most fun I’ve ever had while
programming a computer. Guile and Common Lisp are definitely the most fun I’ve
had programming in <em>Lisp</em>.</p>

                            <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>The delivery of mouse and touch events in Qt Quick is complex, and it became clear a few years ago that we needed to refactor the event inheritance hierarchy, to have some common API for various event types, so that more of the delivery code could be shared. In Qt 5.8 we added QQuickPointerEvent and associated types, as a way of prototyping what that could look like. They are QObjects; and since then, QQuickWindow has been delivering these wrapper events that carry the original events inside. Now finally in Qt 6 we have been able to complete the QEvent refactoring, so that QQuickWindow no longer needs the wrappers. Along with that, we were able to add a few features and fix a few bugs. Many of the remaining bugs that seemed intractable in Qt 5 should at least be possible to fix later on.</p>
<!--more--><h2>Say hello to QPointerEvent and QEventPoint</h2>
<p>The inheritance hierarchy now looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/event-hierarchy-qt6.png?width=1280&amp;name=event-hierarchy-qt6.png" alt="event-hierarchy-qt6" width="1280" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/event-hierarchy-qt6.png?width=640&amp;name=event-hierarchy-qt6.png 640w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/event-hierarchy-qt6.png?width=1280&amp;name=event-hierarchy-qt6.png 1280w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/event-hierarchy-qt6.png?width=1920&amp;name=event-hierarchy-qt6.png 1920w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/event-hierarchy-qt6.png?width=2560&amp;name=event-hierarchy-qt6.png 2560w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/event-hierarchy-qt6.png?width=3200&amp;name=event-hierarchy-qt6.png 3200w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/event-hierarchy-qt6.png?width=3840&amp;name=event-hierarchy-qt6.png 3840w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"><br>QPointerEvent is the new abstract type for all events that come from pointing devices (mouse, touchscreen, tablet stylus). It has the common API to be able to handle all these in a device-agnostic way. Since QTouchEvent can carry multiple touchpoints in one event, we standardized this concept: every QPointerEvent represents potentially a cluster of QEventPoint instances (even though most events only carry one point), and therefore has appropriate API: points(), point(i) and pointCount(). <br>Every QInputEvent (including QPointerEvent) carries a pointer to the QInputDevice that it came from. This allows event-handling code to respond in device-specific ways, even when handling synthetic mouse events. </p>
<p>Every QEventPoint has velocity. The Kalman filter that Qt Quick was using in Qt 5 has been moved to QtGui, so that the average velocity from the last few movements is available wherever the event is delivered. This enables velocity-sensitive behavior (such as distinguishing a slow drag from a quick flick, or responding to a particular direction of movement) regardless which device it comes from. Instantaneous velocity is generally too volatile for such purposes, but if you need it you can calculate it as <code>(globalPosition() - globalLastPosition()) / (timestamp() - lastTimestamp())</code>. </p>
<p>QSinglePointEvent is another abstract type that standardizes the position accessors that used to be separately and inconsistently implemented in QMouseEvent, QTabletEvent, QHoverEvent, QWheelEvent and a few more. They are all floating-point now. position() replaces pos() and posF(), scenePosition() replaces windowPos(), and globalPosition() replaces screenPos(). The old accessors are still there for now, but deprecated: a Qt 5 application will not encounter an SC break just because of handling QMouseEvent, for example. QEventPoint replaces QTouchEvent::TouchPoint, but there is a "using" declaration for the sake of source compatibililty. </p>
<p>I have <a href="https://github.com/ec1oud/clazy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">forked clazy</a> and added a new qevent-accessors check, which might save you some trouble: it can automatically apply "fixits" to get rid of the deprecation warnings stemming from the event accessor renaming. (Yes we should upstream that change.)</p>
<h2>Device-agnostic event handling in C++</h2>
<p>In various places in Qt we can now respond to mouse, touch and tablet events (such as detecting a click or a drag), either by iterating the QEventPoints, or just responding to the first point. Here's a contrived example of how a QQuickItem subclass could do that: </p>
<pre>bool MyItem::event(QEvent *ev) override {<br>  if (ev-&gt;isPointerEvent()) {<br>    QPointerEvent *pev = static_cast&lt;QPointerEvent *&gt;(ev);<br>    for (QEventPoint &amp;point : pev-&gt;points()) {<br>      switch (point.state()) {<br>      case QEventPoint::State::Pressed:<br>        if (reactToPress(point.position()))<br>          pev-&gt;setExclusiveGrabber(point, this);<br>        break;<br>      case QEventPoint::State::Updated:<br>        ...<br>      }<br>    }<br>    return true;<br>  }<br>  return QQuickItem::event(ev);<br>}</pre>
<p>QQuickFlickable::childMouseEventFilter() works this way, for example. And that has an interesting result: </p>
<h2>Flickable handles touch now! </h2>
<p>There were many open bugs related to the fact that Qt 5's Flickable could only handle actual mouse events and synthetic mouse events. Qt only supports one mouse, one mouse position, one cursor (so far, but we're working on that...) and therefore you could not flick two Flickables with two fingers. If you touch some component inside the Flickable that is able to handle touch events, but then you drag your finger across the Flickable in the allowed direction, it uses childMouseEventFilter() to steal the grab from that component; but that involved switching from the actual touch event to a synthetic mouse event, and also remembering to deliver the following updates as synth-mouse events to Flickable. Various things went wrong. Well... those days are over, because Flickable::childMouseEventFilter() no longer cares which device the QPointerEvents come from. If you set pressDelay, it's able to withhold the actual touch press and then replay it to the items inside when the timer expires. Yes, you can now drag multiple Flickables with multiple fingers too.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/parallel-flickables.gif?width=1280&amp;name=parallel-flickables.gif" alt="parallel-flickables" width="1280" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/parallel-flickables.gif?width=640&amp;name=parallel-flickables.gif 640w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/parallel-flickables.gif?width=1280&amp;name=parallel-flickables.gif 1280w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/parallel-flickables.gif?width=1920&amp;name=parallel-flickables.gif 1920w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/parallel-flickables.gif?width=2560&amp;name=parallel-flickables.gif 2560w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/parallel-flickables.gif?width=3200&amp;name=parallel-flickables.gif 3200w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/parallel-flickables.gif?width=3840&amp;name=parallel-flickables.gif 3840w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"><br>Multi-touch still doesn't work with the remaining mouse-only items like MouseArea though, because those still rely on synth-mouse events. But it can be avoided. In general: try to use Event Handlers rather than MouseArea, because (as its name indicates) it's not really intended to support anything more than mouse interaction. </p>
<p>QTabletEvents (from your Wacom stylus, Samsung S-pen, Apple Pencil etc.) are also just pointer events that carry a few more properties, and can be handled by any device-agnostic code that handles mouse and touch events. But we will keep working on improving the experience with those. We didn't add any new virtual functions in QQuickItem for them, but they will get delivered to QQuickItem::event() soon. </p>
<p>Another thing we're still working on is making Flickable behave better with laptop touchpads. A fix is coming soon. </p>
<h2>Left to your own devices</h2>
<p>Platform plugins now have responsibility to discover and register input devices, in order to fulfill the promise that every QInputEvent tells you exactly where it came from. Some of this work is already done on some of the platforms. (On others it's proving to be problematic.) You can get a list of all registered devices from QInputDevice::devices(). The qtdiag utility also shows you this list. </p>
<p>QInputDevice is a QObject, and its parent() can be another device in case there is a natural hierarchy: for example, X11 has master and slave devices, and a tablet stylus "belongs to" a particular tablet device. In other cases, the parent is simply an object within the platform plugin that owns the device for memory management purposes. </p>
<p>On the platforms where the device discovery work is not done, QInputEvent::device() is never null, but may be a generic instance taken from QInputDevice::primaryKeyboard() or QPointingDevice::primaryMouse(). Touchscreen devices are unique though; we already did it that way in Qt 5. </p>
<p>QInputDevice::seatName() correponds to the Wayland notion of a "seat": a set of devices that one user is using. There is little multi-seat support so far, but it will be improved over time. If you configure a <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Multi-pointer_X" rel="noopener" target="_blank">multi-pointer X server</a>, you can see different seat names on different devices, but those names are automatically generated from xinput IDs in the xcb plugin. On Wayland compositors such as <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/experimental/sway/sway-input.5.en.html#SEAT_CONFIGURATION" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sway</a>, it's possible to give the seats arbitrary names; and we plan that Qt will eventually work with that. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Template Haskell (TH) is a widely used yet controversial language extension. You have
probably used it in your own code; with a single line of splice code, you can
achieve tasks like deriving instances and embedding files easily. And you might
also have heard the reasons why people may dislike it: it slows down
compilation, breaks encapsulation, arbitrary IO at compile time is risky, etc.</p>
<p>But it is less well known that Template Haskell also makes cross compilation
with GHC harder. In this post, we’ll show why this is a challenge, some existing
solutions developed by the community, and in particular, how this problem is
addressed by <a href="https://github.com/tweag/Asterius">Asterius</a>.</p>
<h2>Just run some code at compile time, what can go wrong?</h2>
<p>Conceptually, Template Haskell is a principled way of generating Haskell AST at
compile time, like in the simplified example below:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code>

<span><span>import</span> Data.Char</span>
<span><span>import</span> Language.Haskell.TH.Syntax</span>
<span><span>import</span> System.Process</span>

<span>gitRev</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span>
<span>gitRev</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>$</span><span>(</span> <span>do</span>
       <span>rev</span> <span>&lt;-</span>
         <span>runIO</span> <span>$</span>
           <span>filter</span> <span>isHexDigit</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> <span>readProcess</span> <span>"git"</span> <span>[</span><span>"rev-parse"</span><span>,</span> <span>"HEAD"</span><span>]</span> <span>""</span>
       <span>liftString</span> <span>rev</span>
   <span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Suppose we’d like to define a <code>gitRev</code> string that represents the current <code>git</code>
revision in the project repository. This can be done using an expression splice:
it is written using the <code>$(...)</code> syntax, and the content within <code>$()</code> is an
expression of type <code>Q Exp</code>, representing a compile-time computation that returns
an <code>Exp</code> value, which is, in this case, the current <code>git</code> revision as a string
literal.</p>
<p>Splice code lives in the <code>Q</code> monad, which manages the context for Template
Haskell and provides a rich set of interfaces. Inside <code>Q</code> we can query info
about datatypes or functions, allocate fresh identifiers, etc. Arbitrary <code>IO</code>
actions may also be run inside <code>Q</code>. Here, we run <code>git rev-parse HEAD</code> to obtain
the <code>git</code> revision and then return it. When GHC compiles this module, the splice
is replaced with a string literal, and compilation moves on.</p>
<p>So at first glance, Template Haskell is just about running user code at compile
time, what can go wrong? All is right for most developers, who compile to the
same platform they run GHC on, but there’s trouble ahead when you try to do
cross compilation…</p>
<h2>The what and why of cross compilation</h2>
<p>Suppose we’d like to write a Haskell app for an Android phone or a Raspberry
Pi. It’s possible to bootstrap a native GHC release on them and use it to
compile stuff, but given the limited hardware resources of these machines, it’s
wiser to run GHC on a proper x64 build server and emit code for these ARM
devices. When we do so, we’re performing <em>cross compilation</em>. Some terminology:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>host</em> platform is where we run GHC to compile stuff.</li>
<li>The <em>build</em> platform is where we compile GHC. For simplicity, we assume
build=host and only use the host term from now on.</li>
<li>The <em>target</em> platform is where we run the compiled Haskell app. When
host=target, the GHC is a <em>native</em> GHC, otherwise it’s a <em>cross</em> GHC.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a native GHC, Template Haskell isn’t a problem, since GHC can link and run its
emitted code just like native dynamic libraries. But this doesn’t work
out-of-the-box for a cross GHC.</p>
<p>Over the years, people have come up with different approaches to address the
cross compilation issue of Template Haskell, each coming with its own rough
edges; more details follow in later sections.</p>
<h2>Only run TH on the host platform</h2>
<p>If we can’t run emitted code, then how about we don’t run it at all and stay
with a cross GHC without TH support? We’ll preprocess the cross GHC input code,
strip usages of the Template Haskell extension, and replace all TH splices with
the expanded code. And the way to expand the splices would be… using a native
GHC to compile it!</p>
<p>There’s a GHC flag <code>-ddump-splices</code> which dumps the expanded splices code.
Unfortunately, the dump output has extra text decorations and isn’t proper Haskell
source code, so it takes more work to use the dumps. Here’s a list of known
implementations of the splice dump approach:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://source.git-annex.branchable.com/?p=source.git;a=blob;f=Build/EvilSplicer.hs;h=e07034c5b05f47c316a1e68e6a85d54335c8e253;hb=aaa841e60a55524c3efb5e9783b8e6074d2413cc"><code>EvilSplicer</code></a> uses a <code>parsec</code>-based parser to process the dumps
for later consumption of cross GHC. It was used in the
<a href="https://git-annex.branchable.com/"><code>git-annex</code></a> project until late 2018.</li>
<li><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/zeroth"><code>ZeroTH</code></a> is a tool which does something similar, and includes a CLI
and <code>Cabal</code>-related helper functions.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/reflex-frp/reflex-platform"><code>reflex-platform</code></a> uses a patched native GHC which dumps the
expanded splices as proper Haskell source code, and feeds into <a href="https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs">GHCJS</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, making native/cross GHC work together is not trivial:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike <code>gcc</code> or <code>clang</code> which can emit code for other platforms by simply
adding relevant CLI flags, a GHC installation can only emit code for a single
target platform configured at its build time. So two different GHC
installations must be managed in isolated places.</li>
<li>Native/cross GHC must have the same version and process the same build plan to
minimize the chance of emitting wrong code. Say package <code>foo</code> includes a TH
splice that uses package <code>bar</code>, if native/cross GHC sees different versions
(or even same version but different build plan) of <code>bar</code>, the splice behavior
could potentially differ, expanding into wrong code that may be silently
consumed by cross GHC.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the complexity of the required hacks and GHC/Cabal’s lack of cross
compilation support, it’s common to use an external build system (e.g.
<a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a>) to encapsulate this mechanism.</p>
<p>Other than saving dumps of expanded splices, there is another solution to only
run TH splice code on the host platform: the same GHC always compile everything
to both host/target code in one invocation! When running TH, we can just load
host code just like native GHC. This requires quite some customization of GHC
behavior and is only possible for 3rd-party compilers based on GHC API. In
fact, GHCJS used this approach in its earliest days.</p>
<h3>Pros and cons of running TH on the host platform</h3>
<p>Running TH on the host platform works for pure splices, which can only do
things like reifying info and generating ASTs. It should also work pretty well
for side-effecting splices which reads files, spawns processes or fires
missiles, since the splice behavior should be just the same as when we use a
native GHC to compile stuff.</p>
<p>But is this the end of story? Not yet. Here’s one immediate problem: the
native/cross GHC may not consume the same Haskell sources despite our best
efforts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Haskell modules may use the <code>CPP</code> extension with target-specific macros, so
when you compile for different targets, you see different top-level
definitions.</li>
<li>Cabal files may also check implementation/platform/etc, and end up with
different flags or even different modules to be consumed by GHC.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problems above will likely trigger compile-time errors. And there’s an even
stealthier problem that may lead to generating incorrect code instead of a
crash: the architecture difference of host/target, e.g. word size or endianness.
For instance, a TH splice may make use of <code>sizeOf (undefined :: Int)</code>, which is
4 on 32-bit target platforms, and if the host platform is 64-bit, then the TH
splice will see 8, which sneaks into the emitted code without a single warning.</p>
<h2>Run TH code on the target platform</h2>
<p>As explained in earlier sections, vanilla GHC can only link and run host code.
Would it be possible to teach GHC to link and run target code? The answer is
yes. The key to supporting running non-native code is RPC (Remote Procedure
Calls). GHC needs to call into target code to obtain the splice expansion
result; the target code needs to call GHC to do reification. These calls are
achieved via exchanging serialized messages between GHC and the loaded splices.
Since there is a fixed set of operations allowed in the <code>Q</code> monad (as methods of
the <code>Quasi</code> class), the operations and the results can be encoded as a
serializable <code>Message</code> datatype.</p>
<p>This RPC approach to run TH code is standardized in the <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/commentary/compiler/external-interpreter">external
interpreter</a> feature. When running TH, GHC starts an
external process calls <code>iserv</code>, pipes messages to <code>iserv</code> and tells it to load
archives, objects, etc and link code. After a splice starts running in <code>iserv</code>,
<code>iserv</code> may send queries back to GHC and get results. Finally, the splice
expansion result is sent back to GHC.</p>
<p>The external interpreter opens up the possibility of using various emulators
(e.g. <code>wine</code> for windows, <code>node</code> for js/wasm or even <code>qemu</code> for exotic
platforms) to run target code for TH. GHC itself doesn’t need to care about how
the code is actually linked and run in <code>iserv</code>, and TH should work as long as
our target-specific <code>iserv</code> can properly process the messages.</p>
<p>This approach was pioneered by GHCJS, and later made it into upstream GHC by
7.10. Other than GHCJS, known users include:</p>
<ul>
<li>GHC itself, even in native GHC! But why bother? Well, suppose we’re compiling
a profiled library with TH usage. Since profiled code follows different
runtime conventions and links with profiled runtime, in the early days, a
profiled GHC executable was needed. Now, we can simply use a profiled <code>iserv</code>
executable, and avoid the extra profiling overhead in GHC.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell.nix">haskell.nix</a>, which includes support for cross-compiling to
Windows via <code>wine</code> emulation of TH code.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@zw3rk">Mobile Haskell</a>, which are ARM-targetting GHC distributions.
They use Android/iOS emulators to set up the splice runtime environment. GHC
talks to an <code>iserv-proxy</code> process via pipes, and <code>iserv-proxy</code> merely relays
the messages to the real <code>iserv</code> program in the emulator via a socket.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/typelead/eta">Eta</a> Haskell-to-JVM compiler.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tweag/Asterius">Asterius</a>, which uses <code>node</code> for running the WebAssembly &amp;
JavaScript code.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pros and cons of running TH on the target platform</h3>
<p>Compared to running TH on the host platform, there are a few benefits to
running it on the target platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>No host/target incoherence issues, as explained in earlier sections.</li>
<li>Less hacky and more standardized. Although upstream GHC won’t likely contain
<code>iserv</code> implementations for all interesting target platforms out there,
developers can just roll their own if needed.</li>
<li>Simpler, since there isn’t a bunch of hacks to be packaged via nix anymore,
and it works with vanilla <code>cabal</code>/<code>stack</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It would be tempting to announce TH for cross compilation is now a solved
problem! Turns out it’s not. Recall how TH enables running …</p></div></div></div></div>

        <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>Standing in line with other high-end brands, <em>“Less is better”</em> has always been the one principle that we can all observe in Apple’s branding and design. From their physical store layouts to their website and products including hardware and software, Apple has always emanated a sense of luxury in their aesthetic. And that’s what makes them stand out.</p>
<!--more--><p>What standards has Apple set for the world of design? Let’s take a close look at how they do it.</p>
<h2><strong>How Apple Does Web Design</strong></h2>
<p>Do you remember the first time you went on Apple’s website to check out their new iPhone? You were probably really quickly convinced by the clean typography, smooth animation flows, and high definition product images that immersed you by filling your screen… that you wanted one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apple’s web design doesn’t just function, it wows.<img src="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png?width=1383&amp;name=clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png" alt="Apple iPad product images and descriptions clean white space and font" width="1383" srcset="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png?width=692&amp;name=clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png 692w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png?width=1383&amp;name=clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png 1383w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png?width=2075&amp;name=clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png 2075w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png?width=2766&amp;name=clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png 2766w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png?width=3458&amp;name=clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png 3458w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png?width=4149&amp;name=clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png 4149w" sizes="(max-width: 1383px) 100vw, 1383px">(Image Source: Apple)</p>
<p>If we look at how Apple’s website has transformed over the years, we can see that minimalistic web design is one of its most consistent catches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Their website focuses on clutterless single content areas that highlight one piece of content at a time with plenty of white space and wide margins. Not only is this design aesthetically pleasing, it is easy on the eyes and makes content easy to take in.</p>
<p>To make reading even lighter, Apple also uses simple headlines that show you the main idea of the paragraph without requiring you to read the paragraph.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Apple%20homepage.png?width=1488&amp;name=Apple%20homepage.png" alt="Apple homepage iPhone 12 Pro product image" width="1488" srcset="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Apple%20homepage.png?width=744&amp;name=Apple%20homepage.png 744w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Apple%20homepage.png?width=1488&amp;name=Apple%20homepage.png 1488w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Apple%20homepage.png?width=2232&amp;name=Apple%20homepage.png 2232w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Apple%20homepage.png?width=2976&amp;name=Apple%20homepage.png 2976w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Apple%20homepage.png?width=3720&amp;name=Apple%20homepage.png 3720w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Apple%20homepage.png?width=4464&amp;name=Apple%20homepage.png 4464w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px">(Image Source: Apple)</p>
<p>On their homepage, it’s difficult to ignore the huge product image that appears as soon as you enter, filling your entire screen from edge to edge, immersing you in it. The reason behind this design choice is to prevent decision fatigue and give visitors room to breathe. Instead of pushing their products onto you all at once, they let you focus on one single product, one headline, and one catchy subheadline.</p>
<p>Unlike most other websites that use multiple, smaller product photos, Apple uses techniques that obey the principles of visual hierarchy. They use large images, high contrast and bold typefaces for emphasis, and maximize space around it to draw even more attention to the subject. That is why when you glance at the image above, ‘iPhone 12 Pro’ takes center stage before anything else.</p>
<h2><strong>How Apple Does Product Design</strong></h2>
<p><span>It’s no unpopular opinion that Apple products look AND feel luxurious, whether it’s the iPhone, Mac, iPad or Apple Watch. One of the most groundbreaking moments for Apple was when they launched the original Macbook Air in 2008. Their iconic </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ywa_EynjC8"><span>Envelope Ad</span></a><span> went viral because at the time, the Macbook Air was the thinnest laptop ever in the market.&nbsp;</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>When we look at their unrivaled history of success, we can’t help but wonder: What’s been keeping Apple products ahead of the rest all these years?</span></p>

<p><span>Yes, Apple definitely has a strong focus on user experience, premium quality, practical design, and even tasking users’ feedback into consideration. But ask anyone what they think stands out about Apple products, and they’ll mention one thing </span><span>—</span> <em><span>simplicity</span></em><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>The book </span><em><span>Steve Jobs Biography</span></em><span> written by Walter Isaacson highlights Apple’s emphasis on simplicity:</span></p>
<p><span><em>Jobs’ belief in the power of simplicity as a design precept reached its pinnacle with the three consumer device triumphs he produced beginning in 2001: the iPod, iPhone and iPad. He immersed himself daily in the design of the original iPod and its interface.</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>His main demand was <strong>“Simplify!”</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span><em>He would go over each screen and apply a rigid test: If he wanted a song or a function, he should be able to get there in three clicks. And the click should be intuitive. If he couldn’t figure out how to navigate to something, or if it took more than three clicks, he would be brutal.</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>“There would be times when we’d wrack our brains on a user interface problem, and think we’d considered every option, and he would go, ‘Did you think of this?’” said Tony Fadell, the team leader.</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>“He’d redefine the problem or approach, and our little problem would go away.”</em></span></p>
<p><span>This is what makes Apple’s design unique. With Jobs’ hard focus on clean, simple, and sleek, iOS had started a big design wave </span><span>that, to this day, has Android operating systems scrambling to ride it.</span></p>
<p><span>When Apple launched the iPad 2 in Silicon Valley in 2011, Jobs said:</span></p>
<p><span><em>“It is in Apple’s DNA that technology alone is not enough - it’s technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the results that make our heart sing.”&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p><span>Today, it’s clear that Apple designers are continuing his legacy in keeping Apple at the intersection of technology and liberal arts. This is the reason why Apple’s design is great. Their products don't just look good, they’re designed in a way that thinks about the people they’re designed for.&nbsp;</span></p>

Europe and Russia are working together to restrain the expansion of these superpowers, with little success so far.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div id="projects-future-frontiers-99-epilogue-01-contribute-to-future-frontiers"><div><div><h3><a href="#projects-future-frontiers-99-epilogue-01-contribute-to-future-frontiers">Contribute to Future Frontiers</a></h3><p>Future Frontiers is set up as an indefinitely evolving project, to which new modules can be added at any time.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><section><p>I really love C#. It's by far <a href="https://hjerpbakk.com/tag/csharp/">my favorite programming language</a>. And who wouldn't agree? I mean with a piffy, roll of the tounge <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)">Wikipedia description</a> like this, what is not to love?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>C# is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Yeah, yeah", I hear you say dear reader. "I know C# is great to use if you want to write better Java apps, even so, this is the Bekk Functional advent calendar. What are you rambling about?"</p>
<p>I know you love your pure, scalable functions in <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Functional_programming#Purity">Haskell</a> and your fancy web pages written in <a href="https://www.elm.christmas/2020">Elm</a>, but did you spot the magic word in the description above? It said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... <strong>functional</strong> ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes! As the late Sean Connery <a href="https://youtu.be/hKJZ9pzDMCk">said so excitedly</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://hjerpbakk.com/img/christmas/the-day-is-mine.jpeg" alt="The day is mine!"></p>
<p>C# is not only useful on the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/introduction-to-aspnet-core?view=aspnetcore-5.0">backend</a>, while writing <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/">iOS and Android apps</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/?view=aspnetcore-5.0">replacing JS in the browser</a> or as a <a href="https://github.com/filipw/dotnet-script">scripting language</a>, it also becomes more and more functional-friendly with every new language version!</p>
<p>However, what does it mean to be a <em>functional-friendly</em> programming language?</p>
<h2>Functional advantages</h2>
<p>Enrico Buonanno argues in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Functional-Programming-write-better-code/dp/1617293954/">Functional Programming in C#: How to write better C# code</a> that we should care about functional programming because it gives us the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Power:</strong> We can get more done with less code. Functional programming raises the level of abstraction, allowing us to write high-level code while freeing us from low-level technicalities that add complexity but no value.</li>
<li><strong>Safety:</strong> A program written in the imperative style may work well in a single-threaded implementation but due to the mutable state that is in its nature, cause all sorts of bugs when concurrency comes in. Code in the functional style might offer better guarantees in concurrent scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> We spend more time maintaining and consuming existing code than writing new code, so it’s important that our code be clear and intention-revealing. As we learn to think functionally, achieving this clarity will become more natural.</li>
</ul>
<p>C# supports a lot of <a href="https://functionalprogrammingcsharp.com/functional-features-of-c-sharp">functional building blocks</a>, such as <em>function delegates</em>, <em>higher order functions</em>, <em>expressions instead of statements</em>, <em>method chaining</em>, <em>extension methods</em>, <em>yield</em>, <em>LINQ</em>, <em>tuples</em> and <em>local functions</em>. Despite all that, the core functional tenet of <em>immutability of data</em> has always been a C# pain point. Until now.</p>
<h2>Immutability in C#</h2>
<p>C# second greatest error<sup><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></sup> was to one-up Java and introduce the concept of properties as a first class language feature with the poorest defaults of all time: the default property syntax made it all too easy to create classes with mutable properties. The deed is as simple as:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Person</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span><span>uint</span></span> Age <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="https://hjerpbakk.com/img/christmas/the-wolf.png" alt="Listen to the wolf"></p>
<p>Alas, premature aging can take its toll and we should've listened to the dog, hound, wolf or whatever, and make the <code>age</code> property immutable. It came with a cost however, amounting to a lot more work and boilerplate code. I mean, I got bored by just writing out this small example from the past:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Person</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span><span>uint</span></span> age<span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>Person</span><span>(</span><span><span>uint</span></span> age<span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>this</span><span>.</span>age <span>=</span> age<span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span><span>uint</span></span> Age <span>{</span> <span>return</span> age<span>;</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/properties#expression-body-definitions">C# 6</a> made the pit of success a bit deeper by introducing read-only properties using only a <code>get</code> accessor:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Person</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>Person</span><span>(</span><span><span>uint</span></span> age<span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        Age <span>=</span> age<span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span><span>uint</span></span> Age <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/struct#readonly-struct">C# 7.2</a> made declaring our intent more explicit by allowing a <code>struct</code> to be marked as <code>readonly</code>:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Person</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>Person</span><span>(</span><span><span>uint</span></span> age<span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        Age <span>=</span> age<span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span><span>uint</span></span> Age <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is all well and good, yet consider when our class or struct has multiple readonly properties and we need to construct a new copy with an updated value in one or more of them. My head hurts just by thinking about it. The boilerplate has tested my Christmas spirit, why must we endure this error prone, manual waste? A better way must exist!</p>
<h2>Records in C# 9</h2>
<p>And finally this year, at the end of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zu3k2PJumfI">worst year ever</a>, it does! Microsoft bestowed <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-9">.Net 5 and C# 9</a> upon us, giving us my most requested feature: <em>language support for immutable data types</em>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-9#record-types">Record types</a>!</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>record</span> <span>Person</span><span>(</span><span><span>uint</span></span> Age<span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>A <code>record</code> is immutable in that none of the properties can be modified once it's been created. When we define a record type, the compiler provides several useful methods for us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Methods for value-based equality comparisons</li>
<li>Override for <code>GetHashCode()</code></li>
<li>Copy and Clone members</li>
<li><code>PrintMembers</code> and <code>ToString()</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Seems like we're finally winning the war against boilerplate, and if we need to create a copy with an updated value, we can now easily use the <code>with</code> keyword:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span><span>var</span></span> me <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Person</span><span>(</span><span>37</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>Person</span> meAYearOlder <span>=</span> <span>me</span> with <span>{</span> Age <span>=</span> <span>38</span> <span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>With such quality functional features in C# like <em>immutable records</em>, not even time's inevitable flowing towards my 40th birthday and usage of 24(!) year old memes can break this aging developer's Christmas spirit!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>I spent a large part of 2019 working with the distributed and decentralized web, especially IPFS, also known as the “Inter-Planetary File System”. I’ve written a few articles on the topic, on how you can host a web app on IPFS, one of which even ended up on the front page of HackerNews.</p><p>For about a year, I hosted my blog and other apps through an IPFS cluster. I wrote a utility for making pinning files easier on Pinata, a third-party cloud service for IPFS. I made some small contributions to the IPFS core projects. I built some projects with it, including one that I never released–nor fully completed–that used both IPFS and Ethereum. And I even gave a talk about hosting static web apps on IPFS at Node+JS Interactive last December in Montreal.</p><p>That all changed in the Spring of 2020. I called myself out of the distributed web.</p><p>My blog and other apps I built aren’t hosted on IPFS anymore. I don’t participate in those online communities anymore. I’ve stopped writing about the distributed and researching about it. I’ve shelved all my projects that were using those technologies.</p><p>I also updated my blog posts about IPFS adding a note that my blog isn’t hosted that way anymore. More than a few people asked me why, and I always gave the same answer: a mix of technical issues and mostly personal reasons. So, I think it’s time I explain the personal reasons.</p><p>First, I need to explain why I got involved with IPFS in the first place.</p><p>When I first read about IPFS, my mind immediately saw it as an exciting new platform I could build my apps for. The premise of a fully-decentralized platform included unlimited scalability, ultra-high availability and resiliency, no single points of failure, and resistance against attacks like DDoS.</p><p>Coming from a background in which I am always thinking about SLAs, number of nines of uptime, disaster recovery, etc, IPFS sounded like a dream platform that would magically solve all my concerns. And, aside from some performance issues at times, it did. Plus, the small engineer inside me was really excited about being able to play with a new, shiny toy, that had lots of hype around it!</p><p>What happened next for me was a reckoning with the reality of what many people behind the IPFS core project and the community around it saw: the dream of a radically open, unfiltered, and by-design un-censorable platform.</p><p>I have recently opened up about my experience, over a decade ago, with building an app with good intentions but that was then misused (<a href="https://withblue.ink/2020/09/24/that-time-i-accidentally-built-a-spying-app.html"><em>That time I accidentally built a spying app</em></a>). I learned early on in my life and (pre-)professional career about the importance of ethics in software development, and I am now a proponent of the idea that just because something <em>can</em> be built, it doesn’t mean it <em>should</em> be built.</p><p>And that brings me back to why, after spending some time in the world of the decentralized web, I have called myself out, and why I think that should things like IPFS actually become mainstream, they might cause more harm than good in the world.</p><p><strong>I have seen, and I am seeing every day, the dangers of completely unrestricted speech, and I don’t want to be the one enabling that.</strong></p><p>I know that last sentence is a strong ideological statement; some might call it a <em>political</em> statement, but for me it’s more than just political, which is often used to describe extemporary beliefs.</p><p>Many of you reading this will not agree with me, and that’s fine. I’m not going to try and change your beliefs with this blog post. Rather, I’m looking to explain why, while I respect that others might have differing opinions, I stopped doing anything that would actively advance a technology whose ethics I question. To put it in other terms: your freedom of speech isn’t my obligation to enable you and give you a platform.</p><p>In short, I think that while the Internet has helped the world in countless of ways, it has also brought out the worst in people.</p><p>I do believe we need some filters on the Internet. It’s not just about stopping criminal activities, terrorism and child pornography: while I am obviously unsupportive of all them, I also think they’re not the biggest dangers coming from the Internet (yet they’re a very convenient pretext for politicians).</p><p>Instead, I think that regular people’s writings on the Internet is hurting the world on a bigger scale. And the collective sentiment is often manipulated by some “agitators” that are exploiting anonymous online speech for their own agendas: that includes online militias–for example sponsored by foreign governments–whose goal is to destabilize a society.</p><p>In the last few years, completely unregulated online speech has given rise to fake news and conspiracy theories that have actually killed people. It’s offered a megaphone to those promoting dangerous ideas like white supremacy, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, homophobia and other anti-LGBTQ positions, and sometimes outright Nazism. It has tilted many democracies towards right-wing populism and fascism.</p><p>All these extreme ideas have divided societies and increased social tensions. And they’re responsible for a number of acts of terrorism which caused the death of too many people.</p><p>Given our experiences so far, there’s no sign that indicates that a fully decentralized and unrestrained web would be anything but a dangerous wild west.</p><p>In fact, despite being tightly centralized and controlled, social media companies are facing significant challenges regulating what people write on their platforms, and in fact they are usually at the center of every scandal of these years. Decentralization and less control won’t be the solution to this issue, but rather the opposite.</p><p>If you believe that I’m overthinking this, and that it’s not going to be bad <em>this time</em>, I urge you to think twice.</p><p>First, there’s no indication that a new Web would be better than the previous one just on virtue of being decentralized. The same actors that are using today’s Internet to wreak havoc around the world would not disappear in the new Internet, and actually, they could be even more unrestrained.</p><p>Second, while almost everyone in the communities supporting a distributed web are good people, with good intentions, seeing some names in there is concerning to me. Regarding IPFS, advocates (at least for a while) included people like Nick Lim of BitMitigate and VanwaNet, companies responsible for rescuing, among others, <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2017/seattles-bitmitigate-now-protecting-pro-nazi-site-daily-stormer-web-attacks/">pro-nazi website</a> The Daily Stormer <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/11/breaking-the-law-how-8chan-or-8kun-got-briefly-back-online/">and the platform</a> 8chan, a cesspool full of Nazi propaganda, child pornography, and other hate speech. Gatherings on 8chan have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8chan#2019_shootings">blamed</a> for at least three mass shootings in 2019 alone, including the one in the <a href="https://time.com/5648479/8chan-ban-new-zealand/">mosque in Christchurch</a>, all of them motivated by racial hatred.</p><p>The first real examples of the distributed web aren’t particularly encouraging either. Among some of the most popular apps (“popular” in relative terms, of course) for the distributed web is DTube, a sort of YouTube that is built on top of IPFS. As you can expect, the website is full of questionable content, including conspiracy theories, cryptocurrency scams, weapons, RT&nbsp;International’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/26/russia-disinformation-rt-nuanced-online-ofcom-fine">Russian propaganda</a>… and of course, porn.</p><p>In essence, if it’s true that <em>a good beginning makes a good ending</em>… with such a mixed beginning, the outlook isn’t too rosy.</p><p>I understand that my opinion is somehow a minority one, and people will continue to build IPFS and other technologies part of the distributed web. There’s also a chance they might become successful and potentially get mainstream adoption–although at this stage the barrier to entry is too high for the average user.</p><p>However, I feel that it’s my responsibility to not be helping to advance this technology and the beliefs of at least some advocates in the world of the distributed web hold. If the advancement occurs, it won’t be because of my help.</p><hr><p><em>PS: The idea that freedom of speech is an absolute right that should have (almost) no limitations is not a universal one. While that right is granted to people living in all democratic countries, outside of North America it’s accepted that such right comes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/world/europe/el-paso-shooting-freedom-of-speech.html">with limitations</a>, and usually that has roots in the history of those places.</em></p><p><em>For example, in Italy where I grew up, the same constitution that grants freedom of expression (speech, press, etc) also criminalizes “apology of fascism”, or propagating the ideas of fascism; it also sets other limits on speech that is hateful or discriminatory. Other European countries have similar laws, such as the outlawing of Nazi rhetoric and symbology in Germany.</em></p></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><section><p>It is well known that prime numbers are important for cryptography, although it has not always been true. The advent of primes came with several groundbreaking papers almost 50 years ago. Pioneers in introducing asymmetric cryptography, Whit Diffie, Martin Hellman, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, used results from number theory to build key agreement, encryption, and signatures. Prime numbers hold a very special position in number theory, and this carried over to cryptography.</p>
<h2>From Primes to Crypto</h2>
<p>Cryptographic protocols are typically working <em>modulo</em> some prime <em>p</em>. This can be likened to turning the number line into a coil, such that 0, <em>p</em>, 2<em>p</em>, etc. all join at the same place. From then on, whenever we add or multiply the number such that we go beyond <em>p</em>, we can simply remove as many multiples of <em>p</em> as necessary until we come between 0 and <em>p</em> again.</p>
<p>Now, imagine that we used a composite number instead, for example 12. Then 0 and 12 are "the same" in this situation, but that also means that 3 multiplied by 4 is ... 0! One of the intuitions when working with normal numbers is that if <em>ab</em> = 0, then either <em>a</em> or <em>b</em> would have to be 0. Hence, when using composite numbers, there is simply stuff that no longer works the way we’re used to. Fortunately, this is not the case when using the primes — for instance 7 — as our so-called modulus.</p>
<p><img src="https://security.christmas/assets/curves.png"></p>
<p>Let’s make a rule, and let’s call it <em>m</em>. We take the coil we just made from the number line, and since we can always reduce numbers to below <em>p</em>, we label our points on this circle from 0 to <em>p</em>-1. Given two points <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> on the circle, we decided that the output of the rule <em>m</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>) should be the point which is represented by the product <em>ab</em>, possibly after reducing modulo <em>p</em>. It may look like a very natural rule, but it is nonetheless a rule we just agreed on. If you play around with this rule a bit, you will notice some properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <em>a</em> = 1, then <em>m</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>) = <em>b</em> (and the other way around).</li>
<li>For any <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> not equal to 0, <em>m</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>) is never zero. So, if we removed 0 from the circle entirely, no harm would happen — the rule would still be well-defined.</li>
<li>For any nonzero <em>a</em>, there is always some <em>b</em> such that <em>m</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>) = 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>These nice properties — together with a property called associativity — are the properties we need to be able to do cryptographic computations.</p>
<p>Now focus on a particular number on the circle, and let’s call it <em>g</em>. If we take <em>m</em>(<em>g</em>, <em>g</em>), or — to return to the more usual notation — <em>g²</em>, we will reach a new point on the circle. We can continue this process and compute <em>g</em>³, <em>g</em>⁴, etc. At some point, we will reach 1. All the points we have visited in this process are members of the set of numbers <em>generated</em> by <em>g</em>, and if the number of points on the coil is a large prime, then we have a very good candidate for doing cryptography, for example Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Let <em>h</em> be some number in this set generated by <em>g</em>. That means that <em>h</em> = <em>g</em>ᵉ for some exponent <em>e</em>. If it is easy to find this <em>e</em> from <em>g</em> and <em>h</em>, we would have trouble. Fortunately, it turns out that if we use <em>large enough</em> primes, then this <em>e</em> appears to be very difficult to find.</p>
<h2>From Coils to Curves</h2>
<p>Coiling up the number line is not the only way of finding suitable primitives for cryptography. Let’s make a new rule. Instead of using a circle like we did in the previous section, we consider the following equation:</p>
<p><em>y</em>² = <em>x</em>³ + <em>ax</em> + <em>b</em>, where <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are fixed constants.</p>
<p>If we graph this in our usual coordinate system, it may look like this curve:</p>
<p><img src="https://security.christmas/assets/curves2.png"></p>
<p>We will now make a rule on how to combine two distinct points <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em> on this curve. The agreed upon notation is to call this rule addition, but we will have to define what we mean by that. Programming languages often include this mental concept as operation overloading. Draw the straight line between <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em>. It will intersect at a third point, say, <em>R</em>. This could have been a nice candidate for <em>P</em> + <em>Q</em>, but since we are making the rules, let’s make this a bit more interesting. Draw a vertical line through <em>R</em>. It will intersect the curve on the opposite side of the <em>x</em>-axis, and we define this point as <em>P</em> + <em>Q</em>. Just as before, this is a rule we’re deciding here and now. However, this also turns out to be a very useful rule, with the same properties as before:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of having the point 1 on the circle, we imagine a point infinitely far up. (Remember what you see when looking at railway tracks: parallel lines actually meet beyond the horizon, at infinity.) So, now the line intersecting <em>R</em> and <em>P</em> + <em>Q</em> is indeed also intersecting a third point: the point at infinity. This can be made precise, but requires maths from algebraic geometry, which is far beyond the scope of this blog post. This point at infinity has all the same properties as 1 had above.</li>
<li>For any point <em>S</em> on the curve, there is always a point <em>T</em> such that we get a line intersecting <em>S</em>, <em>T</em> and the point at infinity. This means that for any point <em>S</em>, we can find a point we can call -<em>S</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can test this rule interactively in a simple <a href="https://www.geogebra.org/m/ukhajwzs">GeoGebra demonstration</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://security.christmas/assets/ec_group_law.gif"></p>
<p>We just assumed that <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em> were distinct. If <em>P</em> = <em>Q</em>, then we simply use the tangent to the curve at point <em>P</em> instead, and proceed as before.</p>
<p>In particular, take a point <em>G</em>, and compute 2<em>G</em> = <em>G</em> + <em>G</em>, 3<em>G</em>, 4<em>G</em>, etc. Eventually, we reach the point at infinity, and then back to <em>G</em>. We have now spent about 1000 words of this blog post getting here, just to do the same as we did above, and what was the point? Above, we said that computing exponents are secure if the primes were large enough. It turns out that "large enough" is currently about 3072 bits, or a number with approximately 925 digits. That is somewhat strenuous even for a computer, but the elliptic curve version only requires us to work on numbers of size 256 bits, or 77 digits, which is far more efficient.</p>
<h2>Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Key-Exchange</h2>
<p>The Diffie-Hellman key-exchange protocol is widely used today, and its instantiation using elliptic curves is ranked as the best choice in modern cryptographic protocols like TLS and SSH. The protocol is fairly simple. The public information is an elliptic curve <em>E</em> and a generator <em>G</em> for the points on this curve. One party, Alice, samples a random integer <em>a</em> and computes a point <em>A</em> = <em>a</em> <em>G</em>. Another party, Bob, samples a random integer <em>b</em> and computes <em>B</em> = <em>b</em> <em>G</em>. Then they exchange the values <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, and compute the shared key <em>K</em> = <em>b</em> <em>A</em> = <em>a</em> <em>B</em> = <em>a</em> <em>b</em> <em>G</em>. As long as both <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> stay secret, even when an attacker knows <em>G</em>, <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, then the key is secure.</p>

<p><em>Reference: <a href="https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/go_x3dh">https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/go_x3dh</a>. Used with permission.</em></p>
<p>To achieve long-term security, to protect previous messages in the case where someone’s secret keys are leaked after the fact, Alice and Bob can do an ephemeral key-exchange every time they communicate. If <em>a</em> and <em>A</em> is Alice’s long term key pair where <em>A</em> is public to everyone, and similar for Bob, they can run the following protocol to agree upon a one-time session-key. Alice samples a random integer <em>c</em> and computes <em>C</em> = <em>c</em> <em>G</em>, and Bob samples a random integer <em>d</em> and computes <em>D</em> = <em>d</em> <em>G</em>. Then they exchange <em>C</em> and <em>D</em>, and compute the shared key as (<em>a</em> <em>b</em> + <em>c</em> <em>d</em> )<em>G</em>.</p>
<p>The interested reader can check out this <a href="https://play.golang.org/p/qJBI0_2lsGP">simple example written in Go</a>. Are you able to extend the basic protocol to the ephemeral key-exchange on behalf of Alice and Bob?</p>
<p>We finally point out that this protocol is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack, and we need to also send signatures computed on the messages to ensure that the communication is authentic. Are you able to attack the protocol as described above, when signatures are not used? If you found these problems interesting, we encourage you to check out similar challenges at <a href="https://cryptohack.org/challenges/ecc/">cryptohack.org</a>.</p>
<h2>Common Curves</h2>
<p>Not all elliptic curves are suitable for cryptography. There could also be power in choosing a curve and the distinguished base point(s). Hence, implementations tend to choose among a small number of well-known curves. The US National Institute of Standards and Technology <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/186/4/final">maintains a list</a> of recommended curves; P-256 is perhaps the most popular among these.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among others, there is also the <a href="https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/">SafeCurves</a> collection proposed by Dan Bernstein and Tanja Lange. In particular, their Curve25519 has proven to be a popular choice.</p>
<p>Elliptic curve libraries will typically have tailored support for certain curves.</p></section></article></div>]]>

<p><a name="20201204_Modern_TPMS_Sensors_Lets_try_a_DoS_attack"><b>Modern TPMS Sensors: Let's try a DoS attack</b></a></p><p>
TPMS (Tire-pressure monitoring system) sensors have been researched extensively
many years ago, they periodically transmit the tire pressure, temperature
and a unique ID which can be misused for tracking a vehicle. But there is
another aspect: modern TMPS sensors also have a receiver which is typically
used to trigger the data transmission when a new TPMS sensor is presented to
the vehicle ("learning procedure").
</p>

<p>
Here in Europe TPMS sensors usually transmit on the 433 MHz ISM band. The
receiver operates on 125 kHz, very similar to LF RFID. A simple way to make
use of the receiver is just to look for the presence of the 125 kHz carrier
and then trigger data transmission. Current sensors are usually more evolved
and use a modulated carrier which contains command packets and only if the
correct command is received data transmission is triggered.
</p>

<p>
If you already have a receiver you can do of course more than just trigger
data transmission: For example there might be support for different
commands, some sensors even allow firmware updates this way.
</p>

<p>
One such command which is typically supported is switching the sensor into
"Shipping" mode. Why would you need that? When the sensor is operating
normally it waits for motion (there is an acceleration/shock sensor inside)
and only starts periodic data transmission when the wheel is rotating. This
is used to safe battery life. When the TPMS sensor is not yet mounted in the
tire it should not react on motion, that’s why there is this "Shipping" mode.
In this mode the sensor only wakes up every few seconds and looks if there
is a 125 kHz signal, if yes it checks for a valid command, for example the
command to trigger data transmission which usually also leaves "Shipping"
mode and switches the sensor into normal operation.
</p>

<p>
This "Shipping" mode can be misused: If you can switch a TPMS sensor of a
vehicle’s wheel into "Shipping" mode the sensor will no longer transmit data
and the vehicle's tire pressure control light will go on after a while.
Just to make it clear: This warning light is annoying to the driver, it
does not affect safety of the car because the deactivated TMPS sensor has
not affected the actual tire pressure.
</p>

<p>
I have looked at a few TPMS sensors for different cars if this really works,
I choose sensors for BMW and Ford cars. Please note that most certainly
other car manufactures are affected too, mainly because there are only a
few manufactures of TPMS sensors which deliver their sensors to various
car manufactures. My choice for BMW and Ford came from the fact that I
found lots of cheap, used sensor for those cars.
</p>

<p>
Also I only looked at "OEM" sensors for BMW and Ford, which means that those
sensors are mounted by the car manufacturer. There are also so called
"Universal" sensors which are typically mounted by tire dealers, there
are some notes about them at the end of this text.
</p>

<p>
It is quite easy to build a tool for transmitting data on 125 kHz: There
is this cheap EL-50448 TMPS sensor activation tool which only transmits a
carrier without modulation. However the hardware can easily be modified
to modulate the carrier: Most of the time OOK (On-Off Keying) is used
for communication, which means that the carrier is just turned on and off.
The EL-50448 uses a power driver with an unused "enable" pin to generate
the carrier, you can use this "enable" pin to modulate the carrier. The
data rate is slow, a frequently used rate is 3900 baud.  Most of the time
Manchester encoding of the data bits is used, which means that the carrier
changes twice as much (7800 changes per second). This is nothing special
and can be done with probably any microcontroller you prefer to use. The
hardware costs for such a setup are below EUR 20, the transmission range
is about 20 centimeters.
</p>

<p>
How can you find the command to switch to Shipping" mode? Brute force by
trying all possible commands is only an option if the command is short.
The reason is that the sensor only looks for the LF 125 kHz signal every
few seconds. If the command is not longer than two bytes brute force is
possible (it takes a few days), for longer commands it is impractical.
Please note that you also have to find a way to detect if the command you
send causes a reaction of the TPMS sensor, e.g. by monitoring the power
consumption of the sensor or receiving the 433 MHz data signal (which of
course only works if the command you send causes a data transmission).
</p>

<p>
Another option is looking at those TPMS tools which tire dealers and
car repair workshops use to check TPMS sensors. Some of those tools
might support switching a TPMS sensor into "Shipping" mode.
</p>

<p>
Those are the results I found (I won't go into the details to avoid misuse):
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>BMW:</b>

  A certain sensor used in several car models from TPMS Sensor manufacturer
  "A" can be switched into "Shipping" mode. The deactivated TPMS sensor can
  be activated again with a different command. Also if the sensor detects a
  fast pressure change (e.g. by inflating the tire) the sensor leaves
  "Shipping" mode. The command length is four bytes so brute force is no option. 

</li>

<li><b>Ford:</b>

  A certain sensor used in several car models from TPMS Sensor manufacturer
  "A" (the same manufacture as above for the BMW sensor) can be switched
  into "Shipping" mode, it is the same command as used by the BMW sensor
  from above. The deactivated TPMS sensor can be activated again with a
  different command.
  
  A certain sensor used in several car models from TPMS Sensor manufacturer
  "B" can be switched into "Shipping" mode. The deactivated TPMS sensor can
  be activated again with a different command. The command in this case is
  only two bytes and I tried all combinations which resulted in several more
  "interesting" commands, a few examples:


    <ul>
<li>
      It is possible to completely turn off the TPMS sensor. In this case it
      will no longer react on anything, you have to break open the sensor
      case and apply a hardware reset or disconnect the battery to reactivate
      it again.
</li>

<li>
      It is possible to switch the sensor into continuous "carrier transmit"
      mode on 433 MHz. In this mode the sensor will continuously transmit
      the 433 MHz carrier until the battery is empty or you apply a hardware
      reset (see above), it will not react on anything else. There are two
      other similar commands which transmit on the upper and lower shifted
      frequency (the sensor uses FSK modulation, Frequency Shift Keying, when
      transmitting data).
</li>
</ul>      

  Those examples show that it is basically possible to destroy this specific
  sensor by transmitting the appropriate command. Also if the sensor is in
  "carrier transmit" mode it probably disturbs the remote control car
  key fob which usually uses the same frequency as the TPMS sensor.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
You have to be close to the sensor to send those LF 125 kHz signals but it
only takes a few seconds to send the signal. Using a larger antenna (which is
basically a coil) for the transmitter, e.g. large enough to fit in a suitcase,
might extend the transmission range to more than a meter. 
</p>

<p>
How can those problems be avoided? This is actually quite easy, the command
to switch into "Shipping" mode should not be allowed if the measured tire
pressure is above a certain limit, which means that the sensor is mounted in
the tire of a vehicle. This also applies to those other commands of the sensor
from manufacturer "B" which are probably some kind of factory test or developer
commands. Please note that during my tests the commands I described were
possible even when the measured tire pressure was in the range of a typical
vehicle wheel.
</p>

<p>
I contacted the car manufactures (BMW and Ford) before I published this
article, this is the experience I made:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
  <b>BMW:</b>
  The contact information for reporting security issues can be found on
  the BMW website. I had a phone call with the responsible person within
  a few days after reporting the issue. BMW already knew the problem, they
  found it during an internal review. Their latest TPMS sensors have fixed
  the issue by blocking certain commands if the tire pressure is above a
  certain limit.
</li>

<li>
  <b>Ford:</b>
  I wasn't able to find a security contact on the website of Ford Germany
  so I contacted the person responsible for "Public Relation". He promised
  to look for someone who takes care of the issue I reported, after several
  days I got a reply that it is possible to disturb the TPMS system due to
  the nature of radio transmission and that this is a known problem. I wasn't
  able to communicate directly with the responsible person and I then replied
  that the reported issue is not about disturbance but a "Denial of Service"
  and that it is even possible to destroy a certain TPMS sensor used in Ford
  cars. I didn't receive any further information about the security issue, I
  notified them again after several weeks that I am now going to publish
  the issue which was acknowledged.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Some notes about those "Universal" sensors tire dealers normally use: Those
sensors are "Universal" because they can be programmed for different car
models. The main benefit for the tire dealer is that only a few different
kind of "Universal" sensors have to be on stock, it’s not necessary to have
lots of different "OEM" TPMS sensors for every possible car model lying
around. The programming of those …</p></div></td></div></div>

        <section>
            <div><p>The <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero/?resellerType=home">Raspberry Pi Zero</a> and original Raspberry Pi both have a 32-bit ARM architecture which many projects have dropped support for. So when I saw that <a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/4530">containerd recently merged a fix</a> for building containerd on armv6, started to think what I could do with it.</p>
<p>Earlier that month, a user of the <a href="http://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd project</a> which runs very well on VPSes, RPi 3 and RPi4 asked me whether it could work on the Zero and I told him it was not practical or worth his time. After all, an RPi4 with 2GB of RAM, 4 Cores and much faster I/O is only 25GBP/EUR/USD.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd is OpenFaaS</a>, but for a single node, and designed for those who don't want to pay for and manage an entire Kubernetes cluster, GitOps, service-mesh, and IngressController just to deploy a few simple functions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My past experiences told me that it would be a challenge to get the zero working. It has such a paltry amount of memory available and its I/O is really slow. Still, sometimes it's fun to do things that we shouldn't. Had I been <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">"nerd sniped"</a>?</p>
<p><img src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/homepage-9df4b/static/1dfa03d09c1f3e446e8d936dfb92267f/8924f/6b0defdbbf40792b64159ab8169d97162c380b2c_raspberry-pi-zero-1-1755x1080.jpg" width="60%">
&gt; The RPi Zero originally released in 2015.
</p><p>In this post I'll show you what you need to do to deploy functions through the <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli">OpenFaaS CLI</a> and be able to invoke them, including multi-arch builds. At the end of the post I'll explain what the limitations are and whether we should leave the Raspberry Pi Zero with those fond memories we have of it when it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi">released in 2015</a>, 5 years ago.</p>
<h2 id="walkthrough">Walk-through</h2>
<h3 id="prereqs">Pre-reqs</h3>
<p>You will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi Zero</li>
<li>Ethernet adapter and USB &lt;&gt; USB A micro shim</li>
<li>16-32GB class 10 SD card</li>
<li>MicroUSB power adapter</li>
</ul>
<p>Flash the latest version of Raspberry Pi OS Lite to your SD card, and then create an <code>ssh</code> file in the <code>/boot/</code> folder.</p>
<p>Power up the Raspberry Pi and ssh to it with <code>ssh pi@raspberrypi.local</code>.</p>
<h3 id="installgo">Install go</h3>
<p>You can install Go from a package manager, but the version is likely to be rather old. Fortunately the Go team still ship a binary for armv6:</p>
<pre><code>export ARCH="armv6l"
echo "Downloading Go"

curl -SLsf https://dl.google.com/go/go1.13.15.linux-$ARCH.tar.gz --output /tmp/go.tgz
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go/
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/go/
sudo tar -xvf /tmp/go.tgz -C /usr/local/go/ --strip-components=1

export GOPATH=$HOME/go/
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin/
</code></pre>
<p>You now have Go installed, run <code>go version</code> to see it working.</p>
<h3 id="buildcontainerd">Build containerd</h3>
<p>faasd uses containerd rather than Docker, but there are no official binaries for any of the ARM CPUs, so we have to build them from source.</p>
<p>For armv7 and ARM64, you can use my repo <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/containerd-arm">alexellis/containerd-arm</a>. It's my hope to see ARM support upstreamed, but having spoken on several occasions to the containerd team, it seems very unlikely that we will see this happen.</p>
<p>On my first attempt of building I got the following error:</p>
<pre><code>+ bin/containerd
# github.com/containerd/containerd/cmd/containerd
/usr/local/go/pkg/tool/linux_arm/link: running gcc failed: fork/exec /usr/bin/gcc: cannot allocate memory
make: *** [Makefile:188: bin/containerd] Error 2
</code></pre>
<p>The RPi Zero and the largest RPi 1 only has 512MB of RAM and I slowly watched the RAM being eaten up with <code>watch -n "free -h"</code>.. I should have remembered this.</p>
<p>Fortunately I had the battle scars and knew what I had to do:</p>
<pre><code>sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1024 count=1M &amp;&amp;\
  sudo mkswap /swapfile &amp;&amp; \
  sudo swapon /swapfile

<p>This creates 1GB of swap, on the SD card.. which already has terrible I/O, but it may just work.</p>
<p>The other trick you may have seen me talk about is adding <code>gpu_mem=16</code> to <code>/boot/config.txt</code>. It seems pointless changing the split on an 8GB RPi4, but for our RPi Zero, we need every MB we can get.</p>
<p>Second time lucky?</p>
<p>No. It failed again due to some missing libraries. I reminded myself to read <a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/master/BUILDING.md#build-containerd">BUILDING.md</a> from the containerd repo. After adding libseccomp and a few other packages, it started to move along again.</p>
<pre><code>make
+ bin/ctr
+ bin/containerd
+ bin/containerd-stress
+ bin/containerd-shim
+ bin/containerd-shim-runc-v1
+ bin/containerd-shim-runc-v2
+ binaries
</code></pre>
<p>I don't know if it was 10 minutes or over an hour, but it was slow progress.</p>
<p>I then ran <code>sudo make install</code> and copied the systemd unit file into place with:</p>
<pre><code>sudo cp containerd.service /etc/systemd/system/containerd.service
sudo systemctl enable containerd
</code></pre>
<p>I didn't want to start containerd at this time, to save on memory for the next task.</p>
<h3 id="buildfaasd">Build faasd</h3>
<p>The faasd Makefile needed a patch because it was set to cross-compile to armv7, but we needed armv6.</p>
<pre><code>.PHONY: dist
dist:
	CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm GOARM=6 go build -mod=vendor -ldflags $(LDFLAGS) -a -installsuffix cgo -o bin/faasd-armhf
</code></pre>
<p>This took so long to build on the zero that I gave up and built it on my Intel NUC. Fortunately Go is very good as cross-compiling, especially when linking into C/C++ libraries is disabled with <code>CGO_ENABLED=0</code>.</p>
<p>I then ran <code>scp</code> to copy the binary to the Raspberry Pi.</p>
<pre><code>sudo cp faasd-armhf /usr/local/bin/faasd
cd go/src/github.com/openfaas/faasd
</code></pre>
<p>The final step was to install faasd which creates two systemd unit files:</p>
<ul>
<li>faasd - for the OpenFaaS core services</li>
<li>faasd-provider - for the provider that supports CRUD and Invoke operations</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>sudo faasd install
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/12/faasd-install.jpg" alt="faasd-install"></p>
<h3 id="unexpectedissues">Unexpected issues</h3>
<p>I tried to log in with <code>faas-cli login</code>, but it didn't work. I saw a number of errors in the logs <code>sudo systemctl journalctl -u faasd</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Dec 03 23:18:49 zero-dns default:basic-auth-plugin[13218]: standard_init_linux.go:207: exec user process caused "exec format error"
Dec 03 23:18:50 zero-dns containerd[12169]: time="2020-12-03T23:18:50.338589900Z" level=info msg="starting signal loop" namespace=default path=/run/containerd/io.containerd.runtime.v2.task/default/gateway pid=13324
Dec 03 23:18:52 zero-dns default:gateway[13335]: standard_init_linux.go:207: exec user process caused "exec format error"
</code></pre>
<p>It turned out that out of nats, prometheus, and the openfaas gateway, the openfaas basic-auth plugin only nats was available for armv6. It seems that projects really have moved on and left armv6 behind.</p>
<h3 id="thenihadanidea">Then I had an idea</h3>
<p>What if we didn't run the whole OpenFaaS stack at all, but just the <code>faasd-provider</code>? It would allow this tiny device to support all the CRUD operations on functions, and invocations, but nothing more.</p>
<p>The provider seemed to be running well, and responding to <code>faas-cli</code> commands:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/12/provider.png" alt="provider"></p>
<p>We'd lose the queue and async invocations, lose the UI, lose the metrics, but we could still deploy functions and invoke them.</p>
<p>It was already very late by this point so I decided to sleep on it.</p>
<h3 id="inthemorning">In the morning</h3>
<p>I powered up the RPi zero and tried deploying a container directly to the faasd endpoint, and it worked.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/12/deploy.jpg" alt="deploy"></p>
<p>Now, I had to make a few changes. Rather than building with the OpenFaaS watchdog in the container, I just used a Dockerfile and a plain Go HTTP server.</p>
<p>Here's what I ended up with:</p>
<p>Dockerfile</p>
<pre><code>FROM --platform=${BUILDPLATFORM:-linux/amd64} golang:1.13-alpine3.11 as build

<pre><code>export OPENFAAS_URL=http://192.168.0.81:8081
faas-cli publish --platform linux/arm/v6

faas-cli deploy
</code></pre>
<p>Using the PC means we can cross-compile the Go HTTP server and push a multi-arch image to the container registry. The new <code>faas-cli publish</code> command comes in handy for this and can accept a list of architectures.</p>
<p>The <code>deploy</code> command talks to the remote machine over REST and tells it to deploy a function. The server-side handler <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/blob/master/pkg/provider/handlers/deploy.go">deploy.go</a> pulls the image into containerd and starts executing it as a container.</p>
<h3 id="onemorething">One more thing</h3>
<p>When I say that it worked. I should clarify that I'd forgotten to deploy CNI - the networking layer required for faasd and containerd.</p>
<p>I saw this error by running the following:</p>
<pre><code>sudo journalctl -u faasd
</code></pre>
<p>Not that long ago, <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/blob/master/docs/DEV.md">I'd documented all the steps required for a manual installation</a>, but somehow forgot this was needed.</p>
<pre><code>export ARCH=arm
export CNI_VERSION=v0.8.5

sudo mkdir -p /opt/cni/bin
curl -sSL https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases/download/${CNI_VERSION}/cni-plugins-linux-${ARCH}-${CNI_VERSION}.tgz | sudo tar -xz -C /opt/cni/bin

# Make a config folder for CNI definitions

{
    "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
    "type": "loopback"
}
EOF'
</code></pre>
<p>Just changing "ARCH" to "arm" was enough to make it work. So the CNI project are still <a href="https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/blob/master/.travis.yml">building the plugins against armv6</a> for the time being.</p>

<p>Then it was a case of simply running <code>faas-cli deploy</code> again, and finally, it actually worked.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text" v-pre=""><p>Here are few differences between using <code>let</code> and <code>var</code>:</p>
<h3>1. Redeclaration:</h3>
<p>In strict mode, <code>var</code> will let you re-declare the same variable in the same scope while <code>let</code> throws a <code>SyntaxError</code>.</p>
<pre><code>'use strict';
var foo = "foo1";
var foo = "foo2"; // No problem, 'foo' is replaced.

let bar = "bar1";
let bar = "bar2"; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'bar' has already been declared
</code></pre>
<h3>2. Creating global object property:</h3>
<p><code>let</code>, in contrast to <code>var</code>, doesn't make a property on the global object:</p>
<pre><code>var foo = "Foo";  // globally scoped
let bar = "Bar"; // globally scoped

console.log(window.foo); // Foo
console.log(window.bar); // undefined
</code></pre>
<h3>3. Scoping rules:</h3>
<p>The most important difference is the scoping rules. Variables declared by <code>var</code> keyword are scoped to the immediate function body while <code>let</code> variables are scoped to the immediate enclosing block meant by <code>{ }</code>.</p>
<pre><code>function run() {
  var foo = "Foo";
  let bar = "Bar";

  console.log(foo, bar); // Foo Bar

  {
    let baz = "Bazz";
    console.log(baz); // Bazz
  }

  console.log(baz); // ReferenceError
}

run();
</code></pre>
<p>The motivation behind why let keyword was introduced with the language was function scope is confusing and was one of the main sources of bugs in JavaScript.</p>
<pre><code>var funcs = [];
// let's create 3 functions
for (var i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
  // and store them in funcs
  funcs[i] = function() {
    // each should log its value.
    console.log("Value: " + i);
  };
}
for (var j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {
  // and now let's run each one to see
  funcs[j]();
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>Value: 3</code> was output to console each time <code>funcs[j]();</code> was used since anonymous functions were bound to the same variable.</p>
<p>Developers needed to make immediately invoked functions to catch correct value from the loops yet that was also hairy.</p>
<h3>4. Hoisting:</h3>
<p>While variables declared with <code>var</code> keyword are hoisted (initialized with undefined before the code is run) which implies they are accessible in their enclosing scope even before they are declared:</p>
<pre><code>function run() {
  console.log(foo); // undefined
  var foo = "Foo";
  console.log(foo); // Foo
}

run();
</code></pre>
<p><code>let</code> variables are not initialized until their definition is evaluated. Accessing them before the initialization brings about a <code>ReferenceError</code>. Variable said to be in "temporal dead zone" from the beginning of the block until the initialization is handled.</p>
<pre><code>function checkHoisting() {
  console.log(foo); // ReferenceError
  let foo = "Foo";
  console.log(foo); // Foo
}

checkHoisting();
</code></pre>

<h3 id="preword">Preword</h3>

<p>I often reference the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page">manpages</a> when giving a development
presentation or talk, but I’ve only recently come to realize how few people are both <em>comfortable</em>
with the <code>man</code> interface and adept at discovering information through it.</p>

<p>This post is my attempt to share some of the tricks and techniques I’ve picked up over years of
reading manpages.</p>

<h2 id="a-quick-recap">A Quick Recap</h2>

<p>The manpages (short for “manual pages”) are the oldest and longest-running documentation collection
on *nix, stemming back to the
<a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/1stEdman.html">first edition of the Unix Programmer’s Manual</a>
in 1971.</p>

<p>On a modern system, the <code>man</code> command is the most common way to access the manpages:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># access the first manpage named "time", which happens to be time(1)</span>
man <span>time</span>

<span># access a specific section's "time", in this case the C time function</span>
man 2 <span>time</span>

<span># attempt to access a nonexistent "time" in section 5</span>
man 5 <span>time</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Because the manpages were originally published on paper, they were (and continue to be) typeset with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troff"><code>troff</code></a> on most systems. Today, the <code>man</code> command (and other
manpage readers) invoke <code>troff</code> internally and pipe the output to the user’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_pager">pager</a> (like <code>more</code> or <code>less</code>).</p>

<p>In fact, a very simple manpage reader (which only works with section 1) can be implemented with
just three commands pipelined together:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>function </span>myman <span>{</span>
    <span># `-t` and `-e`: run `tbl` and `eqn` on the input, for tables and equations</span>
    <span># `-mandoc`: use a set of troff macros specifically for manpages</span>
    <span># `-Tutf8`: output UTF-8 text rather than PostScript</span>
    <span>gunzip</span> &lt; /usr/share/man/man1/<span>"</span><span>${</span><span>1</span><span>}</span><span>.1.gz"</span> | groff <span>-t</span> <span>-e</span> <span>-mandoc</span> <span>-Tutf8</span> | less
<span>}</span>

myman gcc
myman <span>ls</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Apart from their simplicity and adherence to the UNIX philosophy, <code>man</code> and the manpages serve a
number of important roles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>They provide a categorization: section 1 is for system commands, 2 for system calls, 3 for library
functions, and so forth. This categorization is followed both by the system itself (which populates
several of the sections) and by programs installed by the user or package manager.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They provide offline documentation: <code>man</code> doesn’t require an internet connection, and can provide
much of the documentation that an internet search would yield.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They offer <em>canonical</em> information: searching for a command or function online might tell you
whether it exists, but won’t tell you the flags, arguments, or behavior specific to your system.
For example, <code>man ls</code> will tell you whether your system’s <code>ls</code> is BSD or GNU (and the differences
therebetween). The manpages (on Linux) will also tell you which feature macros you’ll need to define
in a C program in order to use a function (or a variant of a function).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So, let’s move on to some techniques.</p>

<h2 id="colorized-manpages">Colorized manpages</h2>

<p>One of the simplest things you can do to enhance the readability of manpages within <code>man</code> is to
colorize the pager’s output:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/gcc_man.png" alt="A colorized version of `man gcc`"></p>

<p>In <code>less</code>, this is accomplished by setting the <code>LESS_TERMCAP_*</code> environment variables to your
preferred ANSI color codes. Here are the variables you can set:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>LESS_TERMCAP_mb <span># blinking mode (not common in manpages)</span>
LESS_TERMCAP_md <span># double-bright mode (used for boldface)</span>
LESS_TERMCAP_me <span># exit/reset all modes</span>
LESS_TERMCAP_so <span># enter standout mode (used by the less statusbar and search results)</span>
LESS_TERMCAP_se <span># exit standout mode</span>
LESS_TERMCAP_us <span># enter underline mode (used for underlined text)</span>
LESS_TERMCAP_ue <span># exit underline mode</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You may be able to set others corresponding to the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/termutils/manual/termcap-1.3/html_chapter/termcap_5.html">termcap capability names</a>,
but the variables above should cover all of your manpage needs.</p>

<p>By way of example, here is the <code>bash</code> function I use to colorize my manpages:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>man<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>env</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_mb</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[1;31m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_md</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[1;31m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_me</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[0m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_se</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[0m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_so</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[1;44;33m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_ue</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[0m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_us</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[1;32m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    man <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>@</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that you don’t need to use escape sequences as above — <code>tput</code> will work just fine.</p>

<h2 id="other-sections">Other sections</h2>

<p>I mentioned some of the big sections above: 1 for system commands, 2 for system calls, and so on.</p>

<p>90% of <code>man</code> lookups will be in those three, but there are a few lesser-known sections that can also
be useful:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>man 4</code> - Special files and devices</p>

    <p>On Linux, section 4 is used to document special files, usually representing some aspect of
  the machine or its peripherals. For example, <code>man 4 mem</code> will tell you how to use the
  <code>/dev/mem</code>, <code>/dev/kmem</code>, and <code>/dev/port</code> files to read from and write to the system’s main
  memory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>man 5</code> - Configuration files and formats</p>

    <p>You probably know the <code>/etc/shadow</code> file, but do you know how its format is specified?
  <code>man 5 shadow</code> will tell you that. Similarly, <code>man 5 deb</code> describes the <code>.deb</code> package format,
  and <code>man 5 ppm</code> lists the spec for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format">PPM images</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>man Np</code> - POSIX pages</p>

    <p>These pages come in handy for contrasting POSIX behavior with the system’s behavior.</p>

    <p>Some examples:</p>

    <div><div><pre><code>  <span># compare the system ls (on Linux, GNU) to the POSIX ls behavior</span>
  man 1 <span>ls
  </span>man 1p <span>ls</span>

  <span># compare the read syscall to the POSIX read function</span>
  <span># note the categorization: POSIX read is a function, not a syscall!</span>
  man 2 <span>read
  </span>man 3p <span>read</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="searching-and-navigating">Searching and navigating</h2>

<p>Like colorization, searching is more of a general <code>less</code> feature than one specific to <code>man</code>. That
being said, <code>less</code>’s searching and navigating features can make browsing the manpages a much faster
and more pleasant experience.</p>

<p>Searches in <code>less</code> can be forwards or backwards, using the <code>/</code> and <code>?</code> commands respectively. The
search syntax is mostly POSIX ERE, but with some additions (<code>man less</code> has the details!).</p>

<p>For example, to find the first instance of “x86” in <code>man gcc</code> (watch the bottom of the screen for
the search prompt):</p>

<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/Wc0OiKVTrTDiP4tG9bPRWtDwM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/asc_Wc0OiKVTrTDiP4tG9bPRWtDwM.png">
</a></p>

<p>Observe that instances of the search term are highlighted with the standout colors from before.</p>

<p>Once a search term is entered, its results can be navigated via the <code>n</code> and <code>N</code> commands, which
move forwards and backwards in the results list respectively. For example, going through all
of the results for “Windows”:</p>

  <img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/asc_n3S3wteHmbdPrtmyTSkCSVMiX.png">
</a></p>

<p>When the last result has been jumped to, the statusbar changes to “Pattern not found”. Once that
happens, as in the video above, previous results can be returned to by hitting <code>N</code>.</p>

<p>Even this can be simplified: the <code>&amp;</code> command can be used to display only lines that match the given
pattern. For example, retrieving every line that contains either “ARM” or “ABI”:</p>

<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/Wh8QZ4eideLNmCMBmAkYExgEm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/asc_Wh8QZ4eideLNmCMBmAkYExgEm.png">
</a></p>

<p>The effect is more dramatic when searching for the definition of a flag (in this case <code>-D</code>):</p>

<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/17Kcnb8PBNIz8JdogOFKVeDQn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/asc_17Kcnb8PBNIz8JdogOFKVeDQn.png">
</a></p>

<p>These commands are just the tip of the iceberg — <code>less</code> supports searching multiple files at
once, jumping around scopes (opening and closing parentheses, braces, brackets), and marking the
current location for later return. Each of these is documented on the help screen, which you can
get to in any <code>less</code> session via the <code>h</code> command:</p>

</a></p>

<h2 id="wrapup">Wrapup</h2>

<p>Before picking up these tricks (especially searching), the manpages were an item of last resort
for me: I would search the internet or ask a friend, with mixed results. I had no real idea how to
use <code>less</code>, and would just clumsily page around until I found what I was looking for. More often
than not, I would give up entirely.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, the manpages (and the <code>man</code> interface) are not perfect — there’s no
hyperlinking or real cross-referencing, and the entire corpus is written in a 45+ year old
typesetting language designed for <em>physical</em> output, not display in a virtual terminal.</p>

<p>That being said, they’re a <em>fantastic</em> initial resource for pretty much anything concerning your
system — they remain up-to-date (unlike blogs and articles), they’re accurate and concise, and
they’re <em>very</em> UNIX-y (text files and pipelines!).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <!-- Main content -->
                    <p>My previous development laptop was an <a href="https://www.acer.com/ac/en/CA/content/series/acerchromebookr11">Acer R11</a> chromebook. I always ran it in <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/developer_mode.md">developer mode</a> with all the Linux packages I needed installed via <a href="https://github.com/skycocker/chromebrew">chromebrew</a>. This setup worked great except for GUI programs, as (at the time), the built-in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(display_server_protocol)">Wayland</a> server on the chromebook was not exposed to the user in a meaningful way. I relied on an internal tool from Google called <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform2/+/HEAD/vm_tools/sommelier/">sommelier</a> to translate X11 calls to the internal Wayland server. None of this was ideal, but with a lot of scripts and aliases, I made it work.</p>

<p>Recently, I decided to remove the locked-down ChromeOS all together, and set the laptop up with <a href="https://galliumos.org/">GalliumOS</a> so it can be used as a lightweight code-review machine with access to some useful tools like <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a> and <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/">GitKraken</a>. This whole process is actually fairly easy, and a good way to breathe new life in to an old chromebook. This guide will be R11-specific, but the process doesn’t vary too wildly between models.</p>

<h2 id="developer-mode">Developer mode</h2>

<p>A standard feature on chromebooks is “developer mode”. This is a hidden boot mode that is designed to give <a href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os">ChromiumOS</a> contributors and Google developers access to debug tools when testing new OS builds. Along with debug tools, this mode also exposes a Linux terminal with root access to the user via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>-&gt;</kbd>. On an extremely locked down system like a chromebook, this terminal access exposes a lot of new capability. For this use case, we will only use it to modify the system bootloader.</p>

<p>To enable developer mode, simply press <kbd>Esc</kbd> + <kbd>Refresh</kbd> + <kbd>Power</kbd>, and let the chromebook reboot. Once the recovery screen pops up, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd>, and the device is now in developer mode.</p>

<h2 id="write-protection">Write protection</h2>

<p>This step will void your device’s warranty. Chromebooks are able to handle anything you throw at them. Even if you were to delete important system files to the point the device can no longer boot, hopping in to recovery mode can reset the device to a working state. This works via ChromeOS’s write protect mechanism. All important files are protected by hardware-enforced write protection. Since the process of loading a new operating system onto the device involves overwriting important system files (like the BIOS), we must physically disable write protection.</p>

<p>Luckily, on the Acer R11, this process is very simple. Firstly, unscrew the laptop’s bottom plate to expose the motherboard (some screws are hidden under rubber feet). With the backplate off, you will find a screw that looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://retrylife.ca/assets/images/arcer_r11_screw.jpg" alt="R11 write protect screw"></p>

<p>The screw is hard to miss, it is beside the WIFI card, an has an arrow pointing to it. Simply remove it, and put the laptop back together. You now have a fully unlocked device.</p>

<h2 id="flashing-a-custom-bootloader">Flashing a custom bootloader</h2>

<p><a href="https://mrchromebox.tech/">Mr Chromebox</a>, a well known person in the world of Chromebook modification, provides and maintains a very easy to use shell script that handles bootloader modifications automatically. To use this tool, open up the ChromeOS terminal (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>-&gt;</kbd>), log in with the username <code>chronos</code> (you must already be logged in to your personal Google account. This will not work from the login screen), and run:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>crossystem <span>dev_boot_usb</span><span>=</span>1 <span>dev_boot_legacy</span><span>=</span>1
<span>cd</span><span>;</span> curl <span>-LO</span> mrchromebox.tech/firmware-util.sh
<span>sudo install</span> <span>-Dt</span> /usr/local/bin <span>-m</span> 755 firmware-util.sh
<span>sudo </span>firmware-util.sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will open up the <code>firmware-util</code> settings screen.</p>

<p><img src="https://retrylife.ca/assets/images/fwutil_cros_wp-on.png" alt="firmware-util screen"></p>

<p>You will want to select the <code>RW_LEGACY</code> option to load the <code>RW_LEGACY</code> / SEABIOS payload. The <code>UEFI</code> option is technically the better choice, but it will completely remove the device’s ability to run ChromeOS again in the future.</p>

<h3 id="setting-fuses">Setting fuses</h3>

<p>The <code>RW_LEGACY</code> payload only works if the laptop always has power. Once the device completely runs out of power, the boot settings are wiped from the device (not something we want). The solution is to modify the <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/vboot/+/master/_vboot_reference/firmware/include/gbb_header.h">system <code>gbb</code> fuses</a>. This sounds complicated (and it is), but Mr Chromebox comes to the rescue again with the <code>GBB Flags</code> option in his script. <em>After</em> the <code>RW_LEGACY</code> payload has been configured, run his script again, and select <code>GBB Flags</code>.</p>

<h2 id="installing-galliumos">Installing GalliumOS</h2>

<p>On another computer, <a href="https://galliumos.org/download">download GalliumOS</a> (make sure to select the <code>Braswell</code> option), and <a href="https://wiki.galliumos.org/Installing/Creating_Bootable_USB">create a bootable USB</a>. Plug this USB into the Chromebook, reboot, and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd> as the warning screen pops up. This will begin the GalliumOS setup process (which is identical to that of Ubuntu).</p>

<h3 id="enabling-verbose-boot">Enabling verbose boot</h3>

<p>It is nice to know what is happening when the device is booting. To disable the boot animation and replace it with the boot log, edit <code>/etc/default/grub</code>, and replace both the <code>quiet</code> and <code>splash</code> arguments with <code>noplymouth</code> in the <code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT</code> options. Next, run the following, then reboot:</p>

<p>When I first learned to play poker, it took a while before I could get an intuitive understanding of the relationships between the various poker hands. Calculating their likelihood definitely helped get a handle on how many ways for a specific hand to actually occur there were.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, I think laying the hands out in a grid like this would have given me an intuitive understanding of the game much more quickly.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Poker Hands shown geometrically</h2>
<p>So the lowest poker hand, high card, is the most common happening 50% of the time, but will rarely be the winning hand:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/High_Card_1024x1024.png?v=1607134813" alt="High Card" width="1023" height="1023"></p>

<p>The next highest hand is a single pair which has a geometric interpretation of one column with two dots in it:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/Pair_1024x1024.png?v=1607134853" alt="Pair" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>

<p>Two pair has a similar flair to it, except this one has 2 vertical lines:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/Two_Pair_1024x1024.png?v=1607134962" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>

<p>Three of a kind is similar in spirit, but is much rarer than the two preceding hands happening once every 50 hands:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/three_of_a_kind_1024x1024.png?v=1607135086" alt="3 of a kind" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>

<p>For a straight, we need 5 cards that are in order without any gaps and can look kind of like a nice scatter plot:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/straight_1024x1024.png?v=1607135179" alt="Straight" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>

<p>A flush requires all 5 cards in the hand to be in a single horizontal row, but there can gaps between them:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/flush_84512f1f-428d-4ed7-b703-9372fc3575d6_1024x1024.png?v=1607135233" alt="Flush" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>

<p>A full house requires that all points be split into two lines of 3 and 2 points each:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/full_house_1024x1024.png?v=1607135454" alt="Full House" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>

<p>Four of a Kind requires a vertical line that spans the entire grid with an extra point tucked away somewhere:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/4_of_a_kind_1024x1024.png?v=1607135655" alt="4 of a kind" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>

<p>A straight flush is one of the tidiest hands as it requires all cards to be colinear on the same row and be immediately adjacent to each other:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/straight_flush_1024x1024.png?v=1607135809" alt="Straight Flush" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>

<p>The best hand that you can get is a subset of all the straight flushes that you can get. It's just a straight flush all the way against the right side of the grid with the 5 highest cards:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/Royal_Flush_1024x1024.png?v=1607135877" alt="Royal Flush" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>


<p>Looking at poker this way made me realize that there are some interesting hands that we could add to the game.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Rectangle</h2>
<p>This hand is formed when you have 4 points that are <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Collinear.html" title="Mathematical Definition of colinearity">colinear</a> in both orthogonal axes (form a rectangle):&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/Rectangle_1024x1024.png?v=1607136065" alt="Rectangle Hand" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>

<h2>Flower</h2>
<p>This one seems like it would be complicated to spot in the wild, but in reality it's a lot like a full house. You need a Three of a Kind and the other two cards need to be the same suit as one of your 3oK cards, and just before and after it. So, maybe it is a little complicated to spot, but it certainly is an interesting idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/Screen_Shot_2020-12-04_at_18.42.56_1024x1024.png?v=1607136337" alt="Flower Hand" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>

<h2>Want More?</h2>
<p>If you found this interesting, you'll probably love the 3D reconstruction we did of <a href="https://evermontbills.com/pages/walter-white-did-not-have-80m" title="Walter White's Cash Pile Counting">Walter White's cash pile</a> in order to count it.&nbsp;</p>

    <br>
    
    
    <hr>
    
    <p>Overview</p>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>In <a href="https://www.polarsparc.com/xhtml/gRPC-1.html" target="_blank"><span>Part 1</span></a> of
        this series, we provided a high-level overview of <span>gRPC</span>, installed the necessary software, setup the
        environment, and finally demonstrated the <span>Unary</span> RPC communication in both Go and Java.</p>
      <p>In this part, we will continue the journey to the next RPC communication pattern - <span>Server Streaming</span>.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Server Streaming RPC</p>
    <p>The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of <span>Server Streaming</span> communication
        pattern:</p>
    <div id="img-outer-div"> <p><img src="https://www.polarsparc.com/xhtml/images/grpc-06.png" alt="Server Streaming Architecture"></p><p>Figure-6</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>In the Server Streaming RPC mode, the client sends a request to the server and the server responds with sequence (or stream)
        of messages back to the client.</p>
    <p>For the Server Streaming RPC demonstration, we will implement a fictitious Currency Rate service, where the client sends the
        'from' currency and the 'to' currency as the request and the server responds with a stream of 'rates' from different 'agents'.</p>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>We will first demonstrate the Currency Rate service using the Go programming language.</p>
      <p>In the <span>$GOPATH</span> directory, create the project directory hierarchy by executing the following
        commands:</p>
    </div>
    <div id="cmd-div">
      <p>$ cd $GOPATH/src/polarsparc.com/grpc</p>
      <p>$ mkdir -p serverstream serverstream/currencypb serverstream/server serverstream/client</p>
    </div>
    <p>The following are the contents of the file <span>currency.proto</span> located in the directory <span>
        $GOPATH/src/polarsparc.com/grpc/serverstream/currencypb</span> as shown below:</p>
    <fieldset id="sc-fieldset">
      <legend>currency.proto</legend>

syntax = "proto3";

package serverstream;

option go_package = "polarsparc.com/grpc/serverstream/currencypb";

option java_multiple_files = true;
option java_package = "com.polarsparc.gss";

message CurrencyRateRequest {
  string from = 1;
  string to = 2;
}

message CurrencyRateResponse {
  string agent = 1;
  string from = 2;
  string to = 3;
  double rate = 4;
}

service CurrencyService {
  rpc getCurrencyRate(CurrencyRateRequest) returns (stream CurrencyRateResponse) {};
}</pre>
    </fieldset>
    <p>The request message is defined as <span>CurrencyRateRequest</span> and the response message is defined as
        <span>CurrencyRateResponse</span>. The service interface is defined as <span>CurrencyService</span>
        with an RPC method <span>getCurrencyRate</span> that takes in a <span>CurrencyRateRequest</span>
        as an input and returns a sequence (or <span>stream</span>) of <span>CurrencyRateResponse</span>
        objects.</p>
    <p>To compile the <span>currency.proto</span> file, execute the following commands:</p>
    <div id="cmd-div">
      <p>$ cd $GOPATH/src/polarsparc.com/grpc/serverstream</p>
      <p>$ protoc currencypb/currency.proto --go_out=plugins=grpc:$GOPATH/src</p>
    </div>
    <p>On success, this will generate the Go code file called <span>currency.pb.go</span> located in the directory
        <span>$GOPATH/src/polarsparc.com/grpc/serverstream/currencypb</span>.</p>
    <p>From the file <span>currency.pb.go</span>, we see the <span>CurrencyServiceServer</span> interface,
        as shown below, that the server needs to implements:</p>
    <fieldset id="sc-fieldset">
      <legend>currency.pb.go</legend>
      <pre>.
.
.
type CurrencyServiceServer interface {
	GetCurrencyRate(*CurrencyRateRequest, CurrencyService_GetCurrencyRateServer) error
}
.
.
.</pre>

    <p>The following are the contents of the file <span>currency_provider.go</span> that simulates an in-memory
        store for initializing and returning currency rates from fictitious agents and is located in the directory <span>

<p><strong>Presentation: </strong><strong>Esperanto Accelerates Machine Learning With 1000+ Low-Power RISC-V Cores on a Single Chip</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Esperanto Technologies has developed a ground-breaking accelerator chip for large-scale machine learning applications employing over 1000 RISC-V cores.</li>
<li>In this talk, Esperanto provides an overview of the company’s new ET-SoC-1 chip, which features two kinds of general-purpose 64-bit RISC-V cores. The ET-Maxion, previewed at the RISC-V Summit in 2018, is a superscalar out-of-order core delivering high performance for modern operating systems and applications. The complementary ET-Minion core designed by Esperanto is a leaner, energy efficient, in-order multithreaded core with a vector/tensor accelerator unit at the heart of the massively parallel compute array.</li>
<li>The chip’s performance and efficiency is derived from a combination of factors, including the simplicity of the RISC-V instruction set, wide vector/tensor units on every ET-Minion core, a uniquely optimized memory hierarchy, state of the art process technology, and custom pipeline architecture and low-voltage circuits which enables more energy-efficient operation. The result is that Esperanto will deliver better performance per watt than legacy CPU and GPU solutions, as well as competing fixed-function designs without compromising generally purpose flexibility.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Esperanto Technologies</strong></p>
<p>Esperanto Technologies develops high-performance, energy-efficient computing solutions for Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning based on the open standard RISC-V instruction set architecture. Esperanto is headquartered in Mountain View, California with engineering sites in Portland, Oregon and Austin, Texas in the United States and multiple sites in Europe.

Muhammed Abiodun / Unsplash"></a><figcaption>(Muhammed Abiodun / Unsplash)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Slack’s life as an underdog darling of Silicon Valley ended on November 2, 2016. That’s when the upstart communication startup <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13497766/slack-microsoft-teams-new-york-times-ad">published an open letter to Microsoft in the </a><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13497766/slack-microsoft-teams-new-york-times-ad">New York Times</a></em>, offering the tech giant an insincere “welcome” to the world of workplace chat software. The occasion was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/25/13405200/microsoft-teams-slack-competitor-launch">Microsoft’s launch of Teams</a>, a Slack clone that would come bundled with the company’s popular Office 365 suite of products.</p><p>In its letter, Slack warned Microsoft that “Slack is here to stay,” adding: “we’re just getting started.” But the 4 million users it had at the time would increase to just 12 million four years later, while Microsoft — which added Teams to its 365 bundle without increasing the price — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537286/microsoft-teams-115-million-daily-active-users-stats">took Teams from zero to 115 million users</a>. </p><p>That disparity helps to explain why <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/technology/salesforce-slack-deal.html">Slack sold itself this week to Salesforce</a>. The deal, which values Slack at $27.7 billion on revenues of $833 million over the past year, has largely been greeted with cheers. (Ben Thompson <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/salesforce-acquires-slack-salesforces-reasoning-salesforces-opportunity/">offers a typically excellent rundown of the opportunity here for both Salesforce and Slack</a>.)</p><p>But it also feels like the end of an era — one where workers gained new power to bring their own tools to the office, and decide for themselves how they wanted to get work done. Slack first succeeded with small teams who wanted to accelerate their work, and was often dragged into organizations by early adopters. But today, waves of consolidation are leaving people with fewer real choices.</p><p>The rise of smart phones in the early 2010s brought with it a new surge of workplace productivity tools that made mincemeat of everything that had come before them. Box and Dropbox brought easy file storage and sharing. Evernote introduced the idea of ubiquitous, cloud-synchronized note-taking. Sunrise created a more social calendar, while Mailbox and Acompli reimagined email for the mobile phone.</p><p>Slack tiptoed into the conversation in the middle of the decade, and almost immediately became the fastest-growing enterprise software tool of all time. In 2015, just 18 months after it launched, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/24/8836087/slack-1-million-daily-users">Slack reported having more than 1 million daily users</a> —&nbsp;a figure then unheard-of in enterprise software.</p><p>It had a great backstory —&nbsp;a last-ditch pivot from a failed video game called Glitch —&nbsp;and, in Stewart Butterfield, one of the tech world’s most charming founders. It also had a bold pitch: it was going to “kill email” —&nbsp;or, at the very least, reduce your reliance on it. And it would do so by integrating hundreds of other services into real-time work chat, creating a kind of all-knowing command console for your organization.</p><p>The company embodied the belief, so common in Silicon Valley, that the best product would win in the end. “Building a product that allows for significant improvements in how people communicate requires a degree of thoughtfulness and craftsmanship that is not common in the development of enterprise software,” the company wrote in its open letter to Microsoft. “How far you go in helping companies truly transform to take advantage of this shift in working is even more important than the individual software features you are duplicating.”</p><p>And yet if there’s a lesson of the past four years, it’s that thoughtfulness and craftsmanship only got the company about 10 percent as far as Microsoft did by copy-pasting Slack’s basic design. In its open letter, Slack famously told Microsoft: “You’ve got to do this with love.” In 2020, looking at Slack’s size, the idea seems laughable. What’s love got to do with it?</p><p>The thing is, I <em>hate</em> that this was the outcome for Slack. I love good productivity tools, and was rooting for Slack to someday become as good as the company hyped it up to be. (And perhaps it still will: like most giants Salesforce has a mixed track record when it comes to the success of its acquisitions, but some seem to be thriving. When I asked about this on Twitter, people had <a href="https://twitter.com/caseynewton/status/1333891286185644032?s=21">a lot of good things to say about post-acquisition Heroku</a>.)</p><p>But Slack’s struggle to succeed as an independent company sadly mirrors that of many one-time innovators in enterprise productivity. Mailbox died and Acompli sold to Microsoft, where it became the mobile Outlook app. Evernote is a pale shadow of its former self. Of that early cohort, only Box and Dropbox became — and still remain —&nbsp;public companies.</p><p>Why is this the case? To get some insight, I called up Aaron Levie, Box’s affable CEO. In Levie’s telling —&nbsp;and he also wrote <a href="https://blog.box.com/salesforce-slack-and-future-work">a blog post about the Slack sale</a> — it all comes down to sales. The idea that workers would someday choose all their own tools was always a fantasy, he told me, in part because most workers don’t event want to think about their tools. In such a world, the winning app will almost always be one with a giant, er, salesforce behind it. </p><p>Microsoft had one. Slack didn’t. Enter Salesforce.</p><p>“The reality with the enterprise is that you can have the best product, but that’s not good enough,” Levie told me. “You need distribution. And what Salesforce has — they have the procurement officers, they have the finance people. They have all of the apparatus you need to interact with to sell software, and they have it for the top 100,000 corporations around the world.”</p><p>Levie is bullish on the acquisition, because it puts Slack and Salesforce on more even ground. </p><p>“The only advantage Microsoft has is distribution, and so now they’ve neutralized the advantage that Microsoft has had,” he said. “All of a sudden, they can actually fulfill the ultimate promise of the opportunity, because they have 10 times the amount of salespeople that can go distribute this thing into corporations around the world.”</p><p>Assuming Levie is right — and I wouldn’t bet against him — that means the medium-term future of work is increasingly a choice between three giants: Microsoft, Salesforce, and (in a distant third) Google. And with that, the golden age of worker choice in productivity tools seems to be coming to an end.</p><p>That’s not to say that the incumbents won’t always face new challengers. But I wonder whether the low ceiling that Slack turned out to have has implications for some of the other fast-growing productivity companies of the current moment. Should Slack’s sale diminish our expectations for Airtable, or Notion, or Coda? Don’t get me wrong — I’m confident their investors will all get their money back, and then some. But do they have a real future outside the arms of a monolith?</p><p>If not, then the productivity market will become as consolidated as any number of other spaces on the internet, from app stores to search engines to social networks. And as our government antitrust regulators begin to awaken after a long period of hibernation, I wonder if they’ll have anything to say about it.</p><h3>The Ratio</h3><p><em>Today in news that could affect public perception of the big tech companies</em></p><p>⬆️ <strong>Trending up</strong>: <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-news-showcase-paywalled-stories/">Google</a></strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-news-showcase-paywalled-stories/">’s new paid deals with publishers mean that access to some paywalled content will now be available to readers for free</a>.

December 4, 2020 | https://jake.nyc/words/no-one-ever-got-fired-for-choosing-react/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jake.nyc/words/no-one-ever-got-fired-for-choosing-react/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you spend a lot of time on Hacker News, it’s easy to get taken by the allure of building a web app without a framework. There are a bunch of potential advantages (no bloat! bespoke to your project!) and being able to say you built something with minimal dependencies gets you Engineer Points.</p>
<p>That is, if you can pull it off.</p>
<p>I started a new side project recently. It’s a web-based graphics editor, so it needs to be a single page app. My time spent profiling <a href="https://songrender.com/">SongRender</a> for performance issues has made me a little wary of React for building interfaces that update at 60 frames per second, so I decided to avoid it. I’d go (mostly) vanilla and see how far that took me.</p>
<p>I installed <a href="https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/">lit-html</a> and got to work. “Components” were simply functions that returned lit-html template results. A big singleton at the top of the tree held onto all the application state, stored as a global variable within that module.</p>
<p>The first hurdle came when a component needed local state. I could have lifted it to the singleton, but that would have broken the component’s encapsulation. I noticed that lit-html directives can keep state, so I decided to use them to build a tiny component library — ignoring a warning from the lit-html developers that this wasn’t a supported use case.</p>
<p>My home-brewed library worked great… until I needed to run some code when a component appeared on the screen. I started digging through lit-html documentation and issues looking for a way to detect a directive’s lifecycle, but it became clear to me that going down that path would be painful.</p>
<p>At that point, I recalled <a href="https://tomdale.net/2015/11/javascript-frameworks-and-mobile-performance/">this quote by Tom Dale</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have heard from many developers who have told me that they accepted the argument that vanilla JavaScript or microlibraries would let them write leaner, meaner, faster apps. After a year or two, however, what they found themselves with was a slower, bigger, less documented and unmaintained in-house framework with no community. As apps grow, you tend to need the abstractions that a framework offers. Either you or the community write the code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fair enough. Let’s avoid that trap. What about a small framework? I’d heard a lot of good things about Svelte, and although I was slightly worried about the size of the Svelte community I figured it would be fine.</p>
<p>My migration attempt quickly ground to a halt when I wanted a parent component to apply some styles to a child component. In React, I’d pass a class name in from the parent as a <code>className</code> prop. In Svelte, that’s considered a workaround, and the actual feature is the subject of an <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0000-style-properties.md">RFC</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Maybe this is an example of <a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/160.html">dangling by a trivial feature</a>. But it’s so basic a capability that I’m surprised Svelte is on version three without an officially blessed way to do it. I ran into this limitation when I created my <strong>second component</strong>. Way before I got to try out any of the cool reactivity that earns Svelte all that buzz.</p>
<p>So I changed my mind and went with React. After an hour or so, I’d finished moving everything over — and my anxiety had vanished. I stopped worrying about having most efficient component system, and picked up work on the thing I wanted to build in the first place.</p>
<p>No, React isn’t perfect. It’s optimized for apps that make network requests and then display lists of things (i.e. most apps) which isn’t really what I’m doing here<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. The performance is fine now, although I expect I’ll have to optimize as my project gets more complex.</p>
<p>But React lets me stop thinking about the framework. React gets out of my way. React is <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">boring</a>. React is actively developed. React has a giant ecosystem and a giant community. React is battle-tested on some of the most visited websites in the world.</p>
<p>I’m sure there are technically better ways to build a highly interactive interface on the web, but life is too short for me to spend hours trying to figure them out. There are things I want to create, and the only way I can actually create them is to stop spending so much time on tooling.</p>
<p>For now, I’m choosing React.</p>
<section role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>The solution they seem to have landed on — letting the child expose CSS custom properties as props — is actually pretty cool, though I don’t like that Svelte will silently wrap your component with an extra <code>div</code>. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Although Dan, if you read this, the <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1133341485133438982">“animation pass” mode</a> you’ve mentioned offhandedly sounds very relevant! <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

Games generally have a short-lived sales cycle so I am not expecting a huge increase in sales after this.</p>
<p>I’m writing this up to help other indie developers calibrate their expectations. You often read about the success stories because people love to read that it’s possible to make it big with a hit game, but few people bother to write up mediocre outcomes, which is the outcome of <em>most</em> game development efforts. This is called “selection bias”.</p>
<p>You can find a list of all the marketing and promotion I did below, to give you an idea of what kind of an effect you can expect from a single person doing all coding and all promotion by themselves.</p>

<p>Let’s cut to the chase.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>30</code> copies of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cx.mccormick.asterogue" rel="nofollow noopener">Asterogue for Android</a> were sold netting <code>$89 USD</code>.</li>
<li><code>18</code> copies of <a href="https://chr15m.itch.io/asterogue">Asterogue for Windows</a> were sold netting <code>$132 USD</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Total sales = <code>$221 USD</code></p>
<p>The game got a couple of five star ratings on each platform. Interestingly, the average payment for the Windows version was around $6 which is double the suggested $3 (people were able to choose any amount higher than $3).</p>
<p>The main cost making the game was my own time. If I had been charging one of my freelance clients to make this game it would have cost around <code>$5k - $10k</code> over 1.5 months of part time development at my normal hourly rate. Incidentally if you’re interested in having a game like this made, <a href="mailto:chris@mccormick.cx" rel="nofollow noopener">hit me up</a>. :)</p>

<p>It’s interesting to look at the visits to the game’s pages on each platform, and the click-through-rate of people who visited the page and then went on the buy the game.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Windows page on Itch saw <code>1,937</code> views with a click-through purchase rate of just under 1%.</li>
<li>The Google Play store doesn’t give raw numbers but it says the conversion rate is about 1% too.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s an implication here that if I could drive more traffic to these pages I could expect 1 out of every 100 visitors to buy the game.</p>

<p>Here’s a list of all the marketing and promotion I did while building the game:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/mccrmx/status/1306223700199448577" rel="nofollow noopener">Kept a Twitter thread up to date with the latest changes</a> (about 1250 followers).</li>
<li><a href="https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=70875.0" rel="nofollow noopener">Posted devlogs to the TIGSource forum</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/search/?q=saturday%20sharing&amp;source=recent&amp;restrict_sr=1" rel="nofollow noopener">Participated in Saturday Sharing on /r/roguelikedev</a>.</li>
<li>I sent a couple of updates to my own email newsletter subscribers (there are 90 subscribers).</li>
<li>Some <a href="https://dev.to/chr15m" rel="nofollow noopener">dev.to posts</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of everywhere I launched the game:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikes/comments/jkt4ue/asterogue_released_today_sci_fi_pixel_graphics/" rel="nofollow noopener">Launched on /r/roguelikes</a></li>
<li><a href="https://mccormick.cx/news/entries/it-s-asterogue-launch-day" rel="nofollow noopener">On my own blog</a>.</li>
<li>Emailed the <a href="https://infinitelives.github.io/" rel="nofollow noopener">infinitelives mailing list</a>.</li>
<li>Emailed my own email newsletter subscribers.</li>
<li>Created a listing on <a href="http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=Asterogue" rel="nofollow noopener">RogueBasin</a> and in the news section too.</li>
<li>Kenney.nl discord in #promotion</li>
<li>Roguelikes discord in #advertise-releases</li>
<li>On the local game dev discord in my city.</li>
<li>On the local web dev front-enders Slack chat in my city (the game is built with front-end web technology).</li>
</ul>
<p>After release I also wrote some blog posts here on the game’s Itch devlog and linked a couple of these to Hacker News. The post <a href="https://chr15m.itch.io/asterogue/devlog/190653/my-game-wont-sell-and-thats-ok">My game won’t sell and that’s ok</a> got 7k hits.</p>

<p>There are three main strategies I can think of to improve sales for this game and future games:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kaizen. Improving the game. Fixing issues people have flagged and making quality of life improvements from player feedback.</li>
<li>Keep making more games. Compound on the interest and marketing garnered by this game. This is the strategy of <a rel="nofollow noopener">Sokpop games</a> and when I did an analysis of their collective I realized they probably didn’t make a profit until game number 8.</li>
<li>Use a 3rd party company for promotion instead of doing it myself.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am going to allocate time in my schedule to improve Asterogue. I got some great feedback and I want to polish those rough edges and fix all the issues people have flagged.</p>
<p>I will almost certainly make more graphically rich roguelike games in the future, because it was so much fun to do so. Thank you very much to everybody who bought the game, I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>I think the key is to do this without great expectations, just try to make the best games possible, and have fun doing it.</p>
<p>If you want to hear about games and other stuff I make you can follow me <a href="https://twitter.com/mccrmx" rel="nofollow noopener">on Twitter @mccrmx</a> or <a href="https://mccormick.cx/" rel="nofollow noopener">subscribe to my newsletter at mccormick.cx</a>. Thanks for reading!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>In the fall of 2007, my parents gave me an unforgettable gift for my sixteenth birthday: a first-generation iPhone.</p><p>I still clearly remember watching the keynote in which Steve Jobs announced the first Apple-branded phone a few months earlier. As a teenager attending high school in my hometown of Vicenza, Italy, I tuned into the livestream just before dinner, carefully listening to every word he said. That evening, Jobs started announcing a “widescreen iPod with touch controls”, a “revolutionary mobile phone” and a “breakthrough Internet communications device”–theatrically pausing before confessing that he was actually talking about one single device: the iPhone. Thousands of miles away from me, you could hear attendees exploding cheerfully through the live feed. Jobs went on demoing this amazing invention that, a decade later, would end up changing much more than the mobile phones market: it directly or indirectly impacted our society through mobile web, app stores, changing work-life balance, and social media.</p><p>October came, and so did the day I finally got my iPhone. I was really excited as I was the first one in my social circle with one. Every other teenager (and adult!) that saw my phone reacted in awe and with lots of curiosity. More than a few were also secretly envious, something I secretly did not mind. To add to the novelty, at the time the iPhone was only available for sale in the US.</p><p>To get an iPhone for me, my father had to ask a friend traveling to New York on a business trip to bring one back on the plane with her. That was not the end of it, however, as all phones were locked to the AT&amp;T network. In order for me to be able to use my iPhone in Italy, I had to unlock it.</p><p>That process required learning a variety of tools and techniques developed by hackers in the community, then documented in various blogs and forums. The first step was to <em>jailbreak</em> the phone, which gave you full access to the system and allowed you to run third-party apps. Then you’d have add one of those “hacking” apps to your phone, which patched the bootloader to remove the lock the US carrier had put on it. Despite sounding like a mouthful, the iPhone hacking community had worked hard on the User Experience (UX), making this entire process relatively easy for most people with basic tech skills.</p><hr><p>I really loved my shiny, new iPhone, and I was so excited about it that I was willing to accept many of its original limitations. It only supported slow 2G networks, didn’t have copy/paste, couldn’t transfer files via Bluetooth to my friends, and <a href="https://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/">famously</a> didn’t support Adobe Flash, which was ubiquitous on the web at the time.</p><p>However, there was one thing I really couldn’t stand: the Messages application could only store 1,000 texts (SMS).</p><p>That was 2007 — before the days of WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, etc. Instant messaging was something people did on their PCs only, with things like Windows Live Messenger (née MSN Messenger) or AIM.</p><p>For a high schooler like me, text messaging was the main way I kept in touch with my friends daily (<em>what was I supposed to do, call them?</em>). With my carrier giving me a whopping 100 free texts per day (seriously, we had to pay for them), between sent and received texts it would take less than a week to reach the storage limit of 1,000.</p><p>That’s when it all started.</p><p>Because my iPhone was already “hacked” (jailbroken), as a requirement for unlocking it and use it in Italy, I had full system access already. That allowed me to c extract any document I wanted, including my phone’s text message database.</p><p>It wasn’t even a month since I got my iPhone that I had already built a small “app” running on my laptop to archive my text messages forever. I would manually extract the SMS database from my iPhone, copy it to my laptop, then use a set of scripts written in PHP (the only programming language I knew at the time) to store the messages in a local database, and finally display them using a web-based interface.</p><p>This thing I put together worked just fine for me, but I immediately realized the “business potential” of what I had just created. Just like myself, I assumed many others had the same annoyance. I could have used what I learned to help them too, and maybe make some pocket change in the process. As a matter of fact, I did consider myself an enterprising teenager.</p><p>The idea had potential, and the “app” I built for myself already provided solid foundations, so I just needed to do a bit more work to turn it into a commercially-viable project.</p><p>The biggest challenge was making the solution more accessible to others, including those who were not particularly tech-savvy. That’s when I started learning about app development for iPhone.</p><p>Famously, Apple did not want the iPhone to support third-party apps at the beginning, saying developers should build web apps instead. That policy didn’t last long, and with the iPhone OS 2 update, launched in mid-2008, the official App Store came to life: the rest, as they say, is history.</p><p>However, the hacking community had already found a way to sideload apps and had even developed an “app store” called Cydia where you could find games, apps, and even mods to enhance the capabilities of the operating system itself. Cydia came preinstalled on every <em>jailbroken</em> iPhone, which meant potentially hundreds of thousands of people had access to it.</p><p>Everyone could build apps that would be published on Cydia, as long as you knew how to–something that was not remotely as easy to do as it is with today’s tools. As an enterprising teenager with quite a bit of free time on my hand during those winter afternoons and evenings, I took on that challenge.</p><hr><p>The first version of YouArchive.It came out in January 2008.</p><p>Today, you would describe YouArchive.It as a cloud service to store iPhone text messages. You could store all your messages in there, then read and search them using a web-based application.</p><p>There’s still a video left on YouTube showing the application in action (this was the third, and last, version):</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ps5ohEhO3S4" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe></p><p>With YouArchive.It came an iPhone application too. Published on the Cydia app store, it allowed importing messages into the “cloud service” directly from the phone.</p><p>YouArchive.It was free to use with a limit of 80,000 text messages. Because personal communications can be sensitive, all messages were stored encrypted. With a one-time payment of just €5 (about $6), you could become a VIP, remove any limit and enjoy unlimited storage.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*vTxYRljXFl3IBXGRsXOVag.png" alt="A screenshot of iTextUploader running on a first-generation iPhone"></p><figcaption>A screenshot of iTextUploader running on a first-generation iPhone</figcaption><p>For the next year and a half, YouArchive.It continued to grow organically. A few blogs and websites dedicated to iPhone “hacking” and to the underground app stores wrote about the app. Even a small radio program in the US featured it</p><p>I continued developing the app as a side project while in high school. I was also providing tech support and maintaining the infrastructure.</p><p>Listening to users' feedback, I would periodically add new features. YouArchive.It started displaying emojis as soon as the iPhone supported that (outside of Japan, it required downloading an app to enable them).

December 4, 2020 | http://www.andrewturnbull.net/mozilla/history.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.andrewturnbull.net/mozilla/history.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The development and evolution of the Mozilla browser, from its Netscape-seeded beginnings through the Firefox releases of today, can be fascinating.  Numerous changes occurred to the software in terms of technology, features, and appearance; particularly when Mozilla and Mozilla Firefox were both in their infancy and many groundbreaking developments were made.  Much of this software was not widely seen or used when initially released, with its focus limited to enterprising testers and developers for several years.  Several releases however provided the basis for Netscape 6.x and 7.x releases that were oriented towards end users, which as an essential part of the context are also covered here.</p><p>Although I could have conceivably traced this chronology all the way back to <a href="http://www.andrewturnbull.net/nscape1.html">Netscape in 1994</a>,  I have chosen to limit my focus to the post-Netscape 4.x browser development that began from the time Netscape released its preliminary "5.0" source code on March 31, 1998 through the present day.  For consistency, I have also chosen to show the browsers running on Windows 95 (which was current at the time the original code was released) at the same screen size displaying the respective browser's "About" page when possible.</p><div>

<tbody><tr>
<td><img src="http://www.andrewturnbull.net/mozilla/ns404.png" alt="[Netscape Navigator 4.04 screenshot]"></td>
<td>As a point of reference, we'll begin our look back at the history of Mozilla with a screenshot of Netscape Navigator 4.04, which was current at the time when Netscape released most of the source code to its next browser release in development on March 31, 1998.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="http://www.andrewturnbull.net/mozilla/ns50.png" alt="[Unofficial Netscape 5.0 screenshot]"></td>
<td>After the Netscape source code was released, some enterprising users attempted to compile it.  This is a screenshot of one such unofficial "Netscape 5.0" build, available for download <a href="ftp://sillydog.org/pub/misc/mozilla5.zip">here</a>.<p>
The user interface at this point was substantially the same as that of Netscape 4.x, although Netscape trademark references were changed to the codename "Mozilla" or removed altogether.</p><p>
The fire-breathing Mozilla lizard graphic used on this "About" screen was originally one of many <a href="http://home.snafu.de/tilman/mozilla/">mascot graphics</a> used on Netscape's website in 1994-95, and would reappear on Mozilla later on.</p><p>
Many features are non-functional, and this happens to be the buggiest piece of software I have ever used; with frequent error dialogues and crashes.  Given circumstances such as these, perhaps it's not surprising that later in 1998 the decision was made to practically rewrite the browser from scratch...</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="http://www.andrewturnbull.net/mozilla/geckoprev.png" alt="[Netscape Gecko Preview screenshot]"></td>
<td>There is little detailed documentation of what "Netscape 5.0" development went on throughout 1998, and due to the circumstances of the time nearly all development work was limited to inside the walls of Netscape headquarters.  (A page was once created on MozillaZine containing screenshots from this era...and it <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/alookback/">still exists</a>!)
<p>
In December 1998, however, Netscape did publicly release a developer preview based upon this development work and its new rendering engine, called NGLayout or "Gecko."  This preview was not intended as a traditional browser beta as much as a press demonstration of the new rendering technology.</p><p>
Curiously, this build produces the user agent string of "</p><tt>Mozilla/4.05 [en] (Win95; I)</tt>," leading me to wonder if Netscape created the preview by taking Navigator 4.05 and somehow grafting the new rendering engine into it.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="http://www.andrewturnbull.net/mozilla/moz-m3.png" alt="[Mozilla Milestone 3 screenshot]"></td>
<td>In March 1999, the first "proper" next-generation Netscape browser preview was released under the moniker of "Milestone 3" (Milestones 1 and 2 were apparently limited to internal development).<p>
A new user interface with bluish-purple toolbar buttons was introduced, and due to the open-source nature of the program Netscape trademarks were again absent.</p><p>
Interestingly, the "throbber" graphic used on this build was the same blue "N" used as an interim logo on <a href="http://www.andrewturnbull.net/nscape1.html">Netscape Navigator</a> 0.96 and <a href="http://www.andrewturnbull.net/nscape1.html">1.0</a> back in 1994.</p><p>
Although this is usually considered the first proper "Mozilla" release, there are in fact no overt references to "Mozilla" on the browser:  The start page calls it "the Gecko Browser," while the Help menu instead references "Communicator Prototype."</p><p>
These early Mozilla milestones had quite a few bugs:  This particular release has many non-functional features, and the status bar runs off the bottom of the screen at low display resolutions; as seen here.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="http://www.andrewturnbull.net/mozilla/moz-m4.png" alt="[Mozilla Milestone 4 screenshot]"></td>
<td>Mozilla Milestone 4 introduced a number of developments and changes.<p>
The Netscape 1.0 throbber was replaced by a new Gecko-themed one, in which many words and phrases (including "search," "ecstatic," "together," "free," "hungry," "all for you," and "feel good") scrolled past in four directions as the browser retrieved information.</p><p>
The caption "Mozilla" was (temporarily) added to the title bar, a vestigial "Help" menu option was added, fewer links were placed on the Personal Toolbar by default, the purple-tinted Taskbar and status bar were now visible at low screen resolutions, and the sidebar—a characteristic feature of almost all subsequent Mozilla and Netscape releases—was enabled by default.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="http://www.andrewturnbull.net/mozilla/moz-m5.png" alt="[Mozilla Milestone 5 screenshot]"></td>
<td>The changes in Milestone 5 were again minor, with some extra 3D definition added to the top and left edges of the toolbars and the word "Mozilla" removed from the title bar yet again.<p>
The sidebar had been visually revamped, although it was still primarily non-functional.  The sidebar panel in this screenshot rather resembles a mock-up of AOL Instant Messenger, although Don Luchini tells me he thinks it was intended to be a Resource Description Framework-based navigator at one point.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="http://www.andrewturnbull.net/mozilla/moz-m8.png" alt="[Mozilla Milestone 8 screenshot]"></td>
<td>As already mentioned, these early Mozilla milestones were very buggy, and in fact I couldn't get M6 or M7 to run at all without freezing.  By the time Milestone 8 had been released to prospective testers in July 1999, most of the user interface had acquired a lavender tint, the toolbar icons were more widely spaced, and a "Translate" button had been added.<p>
The "Chat" button had been removed from the Taskbar, and text on the status bar now had 3D borders drawn around them.  Additionally, the browser no longer defaulted to an internal start page, the "Mozilla" caption reappeared on the title bar (this time for good), and the "QA" menu compiling frequently-used testing tools had made its first appearance.</p><p>
Interestingly, the Help menu still referenced the software as "Communicator Prototype" at this time.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="http://www.andrewturnbull.net/mozilla/moz-m9.png" alt="[Mozilla Milestone 9 screenshot]"></td>
<td>Branding had improved slightly in Mozilla Milestone 9, with the familiar "m" throbber now in position replacing the earlier Gecko one and the Help menu now making references to only "Communicator" proper.<p>
Given away by their purple tint and "grippy" control, custom-drawn menus first appeared in the Windows and (presumably) Linux versions at this point.</p><p>
Some buttons and controls had also been changed:  The "Translate" button was removed, the 3D borders on the status bar were again omitted, the component icons moved from the right side to the left side of the Taskbar, and other elements on the Taskbar were now limited to three menus titled "Mozilla," "Shopping," and "Open Windows."</p><p>
Milestone 10 (which I was unable to run due to a crash error) is similar.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="http://www.andrewturnbull.net/mozilla/moz-m11.png" alt="[Mozilla Milestone 11 screenshot]"></td>
<td>The visual changes that came to Mozilla with Milestone 11 were dramatic, at the very least.
A totally new teal and blue look with stylized round toolbar buttons was adopted, throwing normal OS-native interface conventions into the blender.  It matched Netscape's web page layout of the time, though.<p>
The sidebar was streamlined, the separate executable used to run the program was retitled from "apprunner" to "mozilla," an "About" screen (seen here) was now implemented, a "Search" button was added to the location field, and the "Shopping" menu on the Taskbar was (wisely, IMO) omitted.  The Personal Toolbar was reduced to a sliver above the main toolbar, and also duplicated the Bookmarks menu.</p><p>
By this point, virtually all remaining references to "Communicator 5.0" in the browser or directory structure had been removed.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="http://www.andrewturnbull.net/mozilla/moz-m12.png" alt="[Mozilla Milestone 12 screenshot]"></td>
<td>Minor changes continued to work their way into the software in M12, with the "My Netscape" option removed from the Personal Toolbar and a custom-drawn scrollbar replacing the lingering OS-native element.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="http://www.andrewturnbull.net/mozilla/moz-m13.png" alt="[Mozilla Milestone 13 screenshot]"></td>
<td>Mozilla Milestone 13 was released in January 2000 and looked almost identical to the previous release.
The Personal Toolbar and Taskbar captions were increased ever so slightly in size, and the "What's Related" sidebar panel was closed by default when first running the program:  Changes clearly on the hair-splitting side.<p>
In terms of packaging, however, Milestone 13 introduced an option of an installer to Windows and Macintosh users.  The installer screens and resulting Start Menu item (in Windows) are captioned "Mozilla Seamonkey," with "Seamonkey" being the codename for the application.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="http://www.andrewturnbull.net/mozilla/moz-m14.png" alt="[Mozilla Milestone 14 screenshot]"></td>
<td>More significant changes made their way into Mozilla M14.<p>
The cryptic text-line application runner had been removed (or at very least, rendered invisible).  The software "About" screen was redesigned and now included the famous mozilla.org star logo and user agent string (though the wrong milestone number was denoted in it!).</p><p>
There were some minor visual tweaks as well:  The drop-arrow was removed from the location field and the "Search" button moved from inside to outside it.</p><p>
<img src="http://www.andrewturnbull.net/mozilla/mozicon14.png" alt="[Mozilla Milestone 14 application icon]">
Furthermore, the first Mozilla application icon was added (seen at right), and the old fire-breathing Mozilla lizard graphic from circa 1994 was brought back as an <a href="http://www.andrewturnbull.net/mozilla/mozilla-splashold.png">application splash screen</a> retained through Mozilla 1.2.1 in 2002.
</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="http://www.andrewturnbull.net/mozilla/ns6pr1.png" alt="[Netscape 6.0 Preview Release 1 screenshot]"></td>
<td>The first preview release, or formal beta, for Netscape 6.0 was released in April 2000, and with the exception of the Gecko developer preview from late 1998 this was the first Netscape-branded release since the groundbreaking of post-4.x browser development.<p>
This presented an interesting circumstance, as the previous Mozilla-branded milestones already effectively served as betas for Netscape 6.0.  This nevertheless was the first release to get extensive media attention and it introduced a number of proprietary features and other differences not in Mozilla M14; upon which it was based.</p><p>
<img src="http://www.andrewturnbull.net/mozilla/ns6icon.png" alt="[Netscape 6.0 application icon]">
Aside from the obvious presence of the Netscape …</p></td></tr></tbody></div></div>

AWS allows engineers to command and control cloud-based infrastructure, data, and other technical pieces of infrastructure without the hassle of developing entire frameworks from scratch.</p>
<p>Initially, AWS was launched to take care of online retail operations for Amazon, but it has turned into one of the most used cloud service providers.<br>
It can be essential for small, medium, and large business to keep up to date with all of the new services AWS is rolling out — as you never know what service might simplify your team’s development.</p>
<p>In this piece, we wanted to cover a few great services we’ve found useful over the past few years to help develop and deploy solutions.</p>
<h3>Cognito</h3>

<p>From authentication to authorization, this technology offers complete user management for your web applications. Cognito can help you by simplifying your authentication workflow.</p>
<p>It even tracks things like user logins so you can track users who log in for security reasons.</p>
<p>Amazon’s Cognito service collects the user’s profile information into user pools, which a web application uses to configure the access to AWS resources. The data-synchronization feature allows users to access information from any device. This data can also be saved locally while offline.</p>
<p>It can also pair with authentication and authorization APIs and plugins from Facebook and Google to further make things easier for you to manage.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing</strong>: The charges are based on the amount of data in the sync store and synchronization operations. With the free version, companies can save up to 10 GB data and perform 1 million operations for 1 year. Once the administer has completed this 1-year period, Cognito charges 15 cents/GB of sync storage and 15 cents/10,000 sync operations.</p>
<h3>Elastic Beanstalk</h3>

<p>Amazon EventBridge acts as a management layer that coordinates events between different serverless modules by using an event bus with the rules-driven router.</p>
<p>The EventBridge builds over CloudWatchEvents by using the same service API as well as the same endpoint. The service provides way for seamlessly connecting data from the SaaS providers and customer applications.</p>
<p>For those who have built serverless applications, this service allows you to easily manage all your various modules.</p>
<p>Through the direct linking that EventBridge offers users can experience high availability and improved speed for the specific service. EventBrige’s easy setup includes zero coding, and it not only enhances performance but also security. It only takes up to one week of the developer’s time for its deployment. At the moment, the only concern is its limited adoption among SaaS providers.</p>
<p>Supporting platforms: About 10 SaaS partners currently support EventBridge. These include: Symantec, ZENData, SugarCRM, OneLogin, Segment, Saviynt, SignalFx, and Whispir</p>
<p><strong>Pricing</strong> plans: Amazon EventBridge hasn’t provided pricing information for the service online.</p>

<p>With the Amazon RDS service, you can generate dedicated instances for your database in a matter of minutes. These instances are supported by AWS’s support team — which is also capable of supporting multiple different database engines, such as SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and MySQL.<br>
This takes away the hassle of needing to buy a new server every time you need to spin up a new instance. Need a test or dev instance? Done.<br>
The Relational Database Service (RDS) allows users to create and operate with relational databases that can be managed through any AWS management console. Moreover, using RDS allows you to access databases and files from anywhere in a very cost-effective and highly scalable manner. RDS offers high availability for primary instance — which are made synchronous with the secondary instance so you can fail over to the exact point at which a problem occurs.</p>
<p>Supporting platforms: Amazon RDS currently supports MariaDB, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and the Microsoft SQL server. Each of these database engines have their own support features.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing</strong>: The free tier is valid for 12 months in which you can get 5 GB of storage, 750 RDS hours, and a 25 GB DynamoDB. Afterward, pricing is based on the services and storage you choose.</p>
<h3>CloudTrail</h3>

<p>Amazon’s CloudTrail service enables enterprises to carry out operational auditing, risk auditing, compliance, and governance for their AWS account.<br>
With this service, you can monitor and retain account activity across your entire AWS infrastructure. The overall service simplifies troubleshooting, security analysis, and resource tracking.</p>
<p>With the multiregion configuration feature, you can deliver log files into multiple regions with a single Amazon S3 bucket, which applies configuration across all regions consistently.</p>
<p>Once enabled, the CloudTrail service is always on as it records account activity upon creation. You can view/download files of the last 90 days and modify operations without having to manually set up the Amazon CloudTrail service.</p>
<p>Supporting platforms: CloudTrail supports logging events for almost all AWS services, including Alexa, Amazon API Gateway, App Mesh, Amazon Athena, AppStream 2.0, and Cloud9.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing</strong>: The CloudTrail service is free of charge for 90 days — you can view, download, and filter the account activity in this time. Afterward, you can get management events at $2/100,000 events, record data events for $0.10/100,000 events, and get insights for $0.35/100,000 events’ analysis.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>AWS offers many more services as well, but the primary objective of this article was to highlight some well-known as well as lesser-known services that Amazon offers to cloud users.</p>
<p>Currently, if there is some redundant task developers need to constantly do over and over again that’s a hassle, AWS probably has a service for it.</p>

<span>Photo by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pexels.com/@negativespace">Negative Space</a></span></p><p><br>When creating software, you’ll make mistakes. Sometimes they’ll be huge, sometimes they’ll be small but you can always learn from them if you spend some extra time documenting them.</p><p>After working for more 10 years as a software engineer I’ve realized it doesn’t change. You might develop some techniques to prevent some from happening but others will show up, it never ends.</p><p>In order to learn from those mistakes and try to avoid them in the future you can develop a bug log. We’ll see here what that is and how it works but I promise it helps.</p><p>I recently introduced this idea at <a href="https://buffer.com/">Buffer</a> where I’ve been working for almost 5 years now and I thought it’d be cool to share it publicly here as well.</p><h2 id="the-endless-cycle-of-software-development">The (endless) cycle of software development</h2><pre><code>1. Work on a new feature
2. Fix bug(s)
3. Go back to 1.
</code></pre><p>Sometimes you might focus on only developing new features or only fixing bugs but those are the biggest chunks of your work if you’re building software.</p><p>I think we focus a lot on the how to develop more effectively new features: using the latest framework, text editor or IDE, a new programming paradigm, etc. and when we build something new again, we try to apply the things we’ve learnt and improve.</p><p>On the other hand, when we fix a bug, we tend to do it as quick as possible and then move on to something else, almost like it didn’t happen in the first place. Very few people spend any time trying to learn new debugging techniques instead of learning the latest framework that came out.</p><p>If we spent more time reflecting on those errors, learning from them and understanding where they came from we could improve a lot.</p><h2 id="documenting-a-personal-mistake">Documenting a personal mistake</h2><p>I’ve started to document those bugs, only the ones where I was the only engineer who did it so I can totally understand the context and reflect on what I personally did.</p><p>There are many different ways to do this, but I thought it’d be cool to have one place where I can gather all of them and search in the future for references and patterns. I don’t know if the term already exist but I called it the “bug log”. 🤷‍♂️ 😅</p><h2 id="what-s-a-bug-log">What’s a bug log?</h2><p>A bug log is a collection of your past introduced bugs with different sections for each bug:</p><ul><li>The context where the bug was introduced and what you were trying to achieve (fixing another bug, adding a new feature, etc).</li><li>Why the bug happened. What was wrong in production that made you realize that there was a bug.</li><li>How you fixed it.</li><li>The lesson you learned afterwards. A summary of what you’ve learned in the process.</li></ul><p>These sections are the ones that work for me, but feel free to adapt them to your needs if you want to start a bug log.</p><h2 id="an-example-of-an-entry-in-the-bug-log">An example of an entry in the bug log</h2><div><pre><code data-lang="md"><span># Context
</span><span></span>When working on this JIRA ticket ____, trying to track an action on the backend,
I merged the pull request and it failed in production in a certain environment.

<span>-</span> Link to ticket: ....
<span>-</span> Link to pull request: ....

<span># Why the bug happened
</span><span></span>The environment variable was not set in one of the environments and that caused
an error in production.

<span># How I fixed it.
</span><span></span>I created the new environment variable by doing X and Y.

<span># Lesson learned.
</span><span></span>When using an environment variable make sure it's available in all the environments
before deploying.</code></pre></div><p>As you can see it’s not anything formal and it’s just for you so feel free to use the format and tone that makes the most sense.</p><p>The nice aspect about this is that if I see this becomes a pattern like if I introduced more than one bug of this type in the next year or so, I can work on a better solution. For example, a parser that compares the env. variables used in a new pull request with the ones that are in production.</p><h2 id="where-do-i-store-the-bug-log">Where do I store the bug log?</h2><p>I’ve become a big fan of <a href="https://notion.so/">Notion</a> and I’ve added it there so other team members can see it but it could be anywhere, any note-taking app or even a Github repo with some markdown files could work.</p><h2 id="what-to-do-with-the-lesson-learned-sections">What to do with the “lesson learned” sections?</h2><p>Something I’ve realized is that by summarizing in one sentence the bug I introduced and why I can easily reflect and learn the lesson. I’ve taken one extra step to not forget it for the future so I use <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank">Anki</a>, a solution for reviewing cards from time to time, helping you learn what’s in the card.</p><p>I used it before for other purposes but I created a new collection for this. What I do is creating a card whose front is the situation I faced when I introduced the bug and the back is the lesson learned. For example, here it’d be:</p><pre><code>Front
--------
What should I do when I use an environment variable in the code?

Back
--------
Check by doing X/Y if it's set in the right environments.
</code></pre><p>Here’s how it looks in Anki:</p><p><img src="https://josemdev.com/images/anki-bug-log.png" alt="Anki Bug Log" title="Anki Bug Log"></p><p>This will reinforce my learning and it’s easier that I remember it in the future. It can also include some code samples so you associated the situation to new code that you’ll be modifying in the future.</p><p>I’m a big fan of <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank">Anki</a> and how it can help you improve as an engineer so I’ll write an article about it soon.</p><p>The other thing I do is before filling a new entry, I can try to search in the log something similar. Sometimes that helps me understand if I tend to make the same kind of mistakes.</p><p><br>I hope this was useful to you! Do you have any thoughts or feedback? Let me know <a href="https://twitter.com/gilgado_">on Twitter</a>! 😉</p></div></div>]]>

<p><em>The following is an excerpt from "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/60E52DB6-B5F7-48D8-8FC5-73A5CE8F8AF4">Big White Ghetto: Dead Broke, Stone-Cold Stupid, and High on Rage in the Dank Woolly Wilds of the "Real America"</a>" by Kevin D. Williamson.</em></p>
<p>"Dogfood—yeah, <em>d</em><em>o</em><em>g</em><em>f</em><em>o</em><em>o</em><em>d</em>—because it looks like ground-up dog food.” He’s embarrassed to be talking about this. “Or sand, because it’s brown. Or diesel. Or killa or 9-1-1. That’s the influence of rap culture down here.” He is a young, clean-cut, Eagle Scout–ish white kid, hesitant about using the words “rap culture,” like he’s not sure if he’s allowed to say that. But he goes on, matter-of-factly. He’s been off heroin for only a few months, so the details are fresh in his mind, even if he remains a little hazy on parts of his autobiographical timeline. “The 9-1-1, they call it that because they want you to know it’s potent, that you’ll have to go to the emergency room.”</p>
<p>That’s a weird and perverse and nasty kind of advertising, but then dope-buying psychology isn’t very much like Volvo-buying psychology: Crashing is just another part of the ride. One spiteful dealer boasts about spiking his product with excessive amounts of fentanyl—a pharmaceutical analgesic used for burn victims and cancer patients—his plan being to intentionally send overdosed users to the hospital or the morgue . . . for <em>m</em><em>a</em><em>r</em><em>k</em><em>e</em><em>t</em><em>i</em><em>n</em><em>g</em> <em>p</em><em>u</em><em>r</em><em>p</em><em>os</em><em>e</em><em>s</em>. Once the word got out about the hideous strength of his product, that killa went right out the door ricky-tick.</p>
<p>The young man explaining the current vocabulary of opiate addiction in Birmingham is barely old enough to buy a beer, and his face and voice are soft. He describes the past several years of his life: “dope-sick and stealing,” going from job to job—eight jobs in six months—robbing his employers of everything not physically nailed to the floor, alienating his family, descending. He was an addict on a mission: “You’re always chasing that first shot of dope, that first high—and the first one for me almost killed me. I was seventeen or eighteen years old, and I met a guy who had just got out of prison, doing a thirteen-year sentence for heroin possession and distribution. He was staying at the Oak Mountain Lodge, which is a nice little classic place.” (In 2013, four police officers and a drug dog had to be treated for exposure to dangerous chemicals after raiding a suspected meth lab in that hotel; the customer reviews online are decidedly mixed.) “I was <em>snorting </em>heroin when I met up with him, and set him up with my connect. He offered to shoot me up, and I wanted to do it. And I remember him looking me in the eyes and telling me, ‘If you do this, you’ll never stop, and you’ll never go back.’ And I said, ‘Let’s do it.’”</p>
<p>He doesn’t know what happened for the next several hours. When he regained consciousness, his junkie buddy’s girlfriend was worriedly ministering to him.</p>
<p>“That was first thing in the morning,” he says. “That night, I did another one.”</p>
<p>Same results. “I’d nodded out from snorting it, but there’s nothing like shooting it.”</p>
<p>He was, he says, a “pretty good junkie” for a time.</p>
<p>This particular opiate odyssey starts off in a Walgreens, something that turns out to be absolutely appropriate. I’m headed up the south coast and then inland on the heroin highway up to Atlanta, starting from the Port of Houston, which connects that city with 1,053 ports in nearly 200 countries and which in December alone welcomed the equivalent of 63,658 20-foot cargo containers of goods into the United States. There was, the feds are pretty sure, some dope squirreled away in there. In fact, all sorts of interesting stuff comes in and out of Houston. In May, U.S. Customs seized a Fast Attack Vehicle with gun mounts headed to the Netherlands. It hadn’t been ordered by the Dutch military. (Organized crime in the Netherlands is bananas: A raid in the summer of 2020 found Dutch police opening up a shipping container expecting to find it loaded with narcotics or stolen goods, but what they found instead was a dentist’s chair bolted to the floor and handcuffs hanging overhead—it was set up as a mobile torture chamber, God knows why.) I’m at Walgreens because I’ve got a long drive ahead and I’m going to be out of pocket for a bit, and I have a prescription to fill: an honest-to-goodness Schedule II Controlled Substance, in the official nomenclature, a term that covers some pretty interesting stuff, including the oxycodone and fentanyl I’ll be hearing so much about in the next few days. Some of us are going to heaven, some of us are going to hell, but all of us have to stop at Walgreens first.</p>
<p>The clerk is on the phone with a doctor’s office: “What’s your DEA number?”</p>
<p>For working-class white guys who haven’t found their way into the good jobs in the energy economy or the related manufacturing and construction booms that have reverberated throughout the oil patch, who aren’t college-bound or in possession of the skills to pay the bills, things aren’t looking so great: While much of the rest of the world gets healthier and longer-lived, the average life expectancy for white American men without college educations is declining. Angus Deaton, the Princeton economist who won the Nobel Prize in 2015, ran the numbers and found (in a study co-authored by his Princeton colleague Anne Case) that what’s killing what used to be the white working class isn’t diabetes or heart disease or the consumption of fatty foods and Big Gulps that so terrifies Michael Bloomberg, but alcohol-induced liver failure, along with overdoses of opioid prescription painkillers and heroin: Wild Turkey and hillbilly heroin, and regular old heroin, too, the use of which has increased dramatically in recent years as medical and law-enforcement authorities crack down on the wanton overprescription of oxy and related painkillers.</p>
<p>Which is to say: While we were <em>ignoring </em>criminally negligent painkiller prescriptions, we helped create a gigantic population of opioid addicts, and then, when we started paying attention, the first thing we did was take away the legal (and quasi-legal) stuff produced to exacting clinical standards by Purdue Pharma (maker of OxyContin) and others. So: lots of opiate addicts, fewer prescription opiates.</p>
<p>What was left was diesel, sand—<em>d</em><em>o</em><em>g</em><em>f</em><em>o</em><em>o</em><em>d</em>.</p>
<p>The clerks at this Walgreens are super friendly, but the place is set up security-wise like a bank, and that’s to be expected. This particular location was knocked over by a young white man with a gun the summer before last, an addict who had been seen earlier lurking around the CVS down the road. This is how you know you’re a pretty good junkie: The robber walked in and pointed his automatic at the clerk and demanded oxy first, then a bottle of Tusinex cough syrup, and then, almost as an afterthought, the $90 in the till. Walgreens gets robbed a lot: In January, armed men stormed the Walgreens in Edina, Minnesota, and stole $8,000 worth of drugs, mainly oxy. In October, a sneaky young white kid in an Iowa State sweatshirt made off with more than $100,000 worth of drugs—again, mainly oxy and related opioid painkillers, from a Walgreens in St. Petersburg, Florida. Other Walgreens locations—in Liberty, Kansas; East Bradford, Pennsylvania; Elk Grove, California; Kaysville, Utah; Virginia Beach; New Orleans—all have been hit by armed robbers or sneak thieves over the past year or so, and there have been many more oxy thefts.</p>
<p>It won’t make the terrified clerks feel any better, but there’s poetic justice in that: In 2013, Walgreens paid the second-largest fine ever imposed under the Controlled Substances Act for being so loosey-goosey in handling oxy at its distribution center in Jupiter, Florida, that it enabled untold quantities of the stuff to reach the black market. The typical pharmacy sells 73,000 oxycodone pills a year; six Walgreens in Florida were going through more than 1 million pills a year—each. A few years before that, Purdue was fined $634.5 million for misleading the public about the addictiveness of oxycodone. Kentucky, which has been absolutely ravaged by opiate addiction, is still pursuing litigation against Purdue, and it has threatened to take its case all the way to the Supreme Court, if it comes to that.</p>
<p>Ground Zero in the opiate epidemic isn’t some exotic Taliban-managed poppy field or some cartel boss’s fortified compound: It’s right there at Walgreens, in the middle of every city and town in the country.</p>
<p>I pick up my prescription and get on my way.</p>
<p>The next afternoon, having driven past billboards advertising boudin and strip joints with early-bird lunch specials and casino after casino after sad little casino; help-wanted signs for drilling-fluid businesses and the Tiger Truck Stop (which has a twenty-four-hour Cajun café and an actual no-kidding <em>live tiger </em>in a cage out front); past Whiskey Bay and Contraband Bayou, where the pirate Jean Lafitte once stashed his booty; around the Port of New Orleans, another <em>entrepôt </em>for heroin and cocaine—it is almost as close to Cartagena as it is to New York—I arrive at a reasonably infamous New Orleans drug corner, where I inquire as discreetly as I can about the availability of prescription …</p></div></div>

            <div>
              
              <article><p>I’ve been playing with the builder patter to express test scenarios in a succinct and declarative manner. I’ve liked the outcome and feel that this design can yield to pretty good test code, so I’ll dig through this idea here. Note that, while this post and the associated code talk about Rust, <strong>the ideas presented here apply to any language</strong>. So don’t leave just because I said Rust!</p>
<hr>
<p>While Rust provides excellent facilities to execute unit and integration tests via <code>cargo test</code>, the APIs to write such tests are… extremely limited. In essence, we can tag tests functions with <code>#[test]</code> and we can then use the <code>assert*</code> family of macros plus <code>unwrap()/expect()</code> calls to validate values. But that’s about it. No fixtures. No <a href="https://junit.org/junit5/">JUnit-like advanced features</a>. No <a href="https://truth.dev/">Truth-like expressive assertions</a>. No nothing.</p>
<p>These limitations, and in particular the lack of fixtures, can lead to convoluted test code. The fact is that some tests, even if they are true unit tests, require quite a bit of boilerplate: prepare fake objects with golden values, inject those into the code under test, and validate results. If we want to adhere to the principle of making each individual test case (aka each <code>#[test]</code> function) focus on a single behavior, we find ourselves with a lot of code duplication. Code duplication blurs the essence behind each test, which then makes tests harder to maintain—and hard to maintain tests is something you <em>really</em> do not want in a codebase.</p>
<p>To mitigate these limitations and keep the content of test functions focused on behavior, I’ve found myself writing helpers of the form <code>do_ok_test_for_blah()</code>. These helpers wrap the <code>blah()</code> under test and abstract away all of the uninteresting setup/teardown noise, customizing these based on input parameters.</p>
<p>The problem is that functions like <code>do_ok_test_for_blah()</code> quickly become complex. As you add more test cases, the amount of parameters to pass to these functions grows too, and the tests that used to be succinct aren’t any more. To compensate, you might add extra functions like <code>do_ok_test_for_blah_with_bleh()</code> that provide even further wrapping… but then you end up with a real mess that goes counter the original goal of simplifying the test code. Mind you, a lot of the older tests in EndBASIC suffer from this problem and it’s a pain to touch them, so I had to find a solution.</p>
<p>Of course, there are crates out there to provide extra testing facilities for Rust. But how far can we get with the simple Rust primitives? Pretty far actually.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What if we used the builder pattern to define the test scenario with required and optional properties, set expectations in a declarative manner, and then hid the test logic within it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea is to define a <em>type</em> (or <code>struct</code>, or <code>class</code>, or whatever your language of choice offers to encapsulate data) that holds all details needed to set up a test and also carries the expectations of the test. The type requires the minimum amount of parameters to run a “null” test scenario, and allows passing all other parameters in an optional manner. Lastly, a single <code>run()</code>-like function takes care of preparing the test scenario and running through it.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let’s illustrate all these words with a trivial example.</p>
<p>Consider a simple and non-generic <code>sum_all</code> function that takes an array of <code>i32</code> values and sums them all:</p>
<div>
  
  
  <div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>#[cfg(test)]</span><span> </span><span>mod</span> <span>tests</span><span>;</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>/// Sums all input `values` and returns the total.
</span><span></span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>sum_all</span><span>(</span><span>values</span>: <span>&amp;</span><span>[</span><span>i32</span><span>])</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>i32</span> <span>{</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>result</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>;</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>v</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span> </span><span>values</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>        </span><span>result</span><span> </span><span>+=</span><span> </span><span>v</span><span>;</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>result</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>
  
  </div>

<p>Yes, this is a simplistic function that can be trivially tested: using the builder pattern here is overkill, but hopefully you get the idea of how this helps verify more complex interfaces.</p>
<p>To test this function, we define a <code>SumAllTest</code> type to represent the builder pattern, with these properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given that <code>sum_all()</code> always returns a value, the test must always know what value to expect; therefore, we express this requirement as part of the type’s constructor.</li>
<li>The data to pass to the function is variable, though, so we make it optional via an <code>add_value()</code> method. I’ve chosen to use an accumulator method here to further illustrate how a builder might be helpful.</li>
<li>We define a <code>run()</code> method that <em>consumes the builder</em> and executes the test.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our test code looks like this:</p>
<div>
  
  
  <div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>#![deny(warnings)]</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>crate</span>::<span>*</span><span>;</span><span>

</span><span></span><span>#[test]</span><span>

</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>#[test]</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>fn</span> <span>test_sum_all_with_one_value</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>SumAllTest</span>::<span>expect</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>).</span><span>add_value</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>).</span><span>run</span><span>();</span><span>

</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>
  
  </div>

<p>The beauty of this design is that each test case is now declarative. The test case expresses, <em>in code</em>, what the test scenario looks like and what the expectations are. And given the simplicity of the calls, we can trivially express each scenario in its own test case. When we run the tests, we get what we expect:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">running 3 tests
test tests::test_sum_all_many_values ... ok
test tests::test_sum_all_no_values ... ok
test tests::test_sum_all_one_value ... ok

test result: ok. 3 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
</code></pre></div><p>Great!</p>
<p>But before we go, there is <em>one key detail</em> I glanced over. This detail is critical to ensure that your tests always do the right thing:</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT: The test builder has to be annotated with <code>#[must_use]</code>.</strong> You may want also want to accompany that with the optional <code>#[deny(warnings)]</code>.</p>
<p>You see: given the above design, it’s all too easy to forget to call <code>run()</code> on the test builder—and if you forget to do that, the test will do nothing and will always pass. That’s too risky for test code. Fortunately, by using the <code>#[must_use]</code> annotation on the builder type, the compiler will catch such problems.</p>
<p>To witness: if we remove the <code>run()</code> call from any of the tests above and try to build:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">error: unused `SumAllTest` that must be used
  --&gt; src/tests.rs:33:5
   |
33 |     SumAllTest::expect(0);
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   |
</code></pre></div><p>Rust fails the build and tells us that we forgot to consume the builder object. There is no way we can forget to call <code>run()</code> once we have initialized a <code>SumAllTest</code> object, so the test code will always be exercised.</p>

<section id="content">

      <p>PHP8 was <a href="https://www.php.net/releases/8.0/en.php">released</a> on the
26<sup>th</sup> of November 2020. It brought a lot of interesting things,
security-wise, but also showcases a couple of (minor) missed opportunities in my
opinion.</p>
<h2 id="type-safety"><a href="#type-safety">Type safety</a></h2>
<p>I'm a big fan on relying on typing to ensure security properties,
like <a href="https://web.dev/trusted-types/">Trusted types</a> in javascript: it
shouldn't compile if it's not secure.</p>
<p>PHP8 won't try to cast string into numbers anymore, thanks to the 
<a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/string_to_number_comparison">Saner string to number comparisons RFC</a>,
meaning that collision with hashes starting with <code>0e</code> and the likes are finally
a thing of the past! This is a subset of Snuffleupagus' <a href="https://snuffleupagus.readthedocs.io/features.html#preventing-sloppy-comparisons">sloppy comparison
prevention</a> feature.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/consistent_type_errors">Consistent type errors for internal functions RFC</a>
will prevent things like <code>0 == strcmp($_GET['username'], $password)</code> bypasses,
since <code>strcmp</code> won't return <code>null</code> and spit a warning any longer,
but will throw a proper exception instead. This was also a <a href="https://externals.io/message/106522">nice opportunity</a>
for PHP to add annotations for functions parameters and return types.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/arithmetic_operator_type_checks">Stricter type checks for arithmetic/bitwise operators</a>
and <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/engine_warnings">PHP RFC: Reclassifying engine warnings</a> RFC
are in the same spirit.</p>
<h2 id="jit"><a href="#jit">JIT</a></h2>
<p>PHP8 comes with a <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/jit">JIT</a> based on
<a href="https://luajit.org/dynasm.html">DynASM</a>, bringing an RWX memory space into
PHP's memory space, into a shared allocation, meaning that its offset won't
change between different PHP8+ processes.</p>
<p>Moreover, DynASM isn't designed with processing/compilation/execution of
untrusted code in mind, and doesn't do things like constants blinding and
advanced folding to mitigate against spraying, nor random padding/nop
insertion, nor ensuring that the memory region is never both writeable <em>and</em>
executable to prevent direct code injection. This means that it's now way
easier to gain native code execution when exploiting memory corruptions,
albeit to be fair, most attackers are happy with a php code execution,
and won't push further.</p>
<p>Having a JIT comes with a lot of code complexity and maintenance burden. I'll
be without doubt a <a href="https://bugs.php.net/search.php?cmd=display&amp;order_by=ts1&amp;direction=DESC&amp;limit=30&amp;package_name[]=JIT">great source of
bugs</a>,
for a minor speed improvement on real-life workloads.</p>
<h2 id="cryptography"><a href="#cryptography">Cryptography</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><code>password_hash</code> now automatically generates a salt, accepting a
    user-provided one is deprecated.</li>
<li><code>crypt</code> will now fail instead of silently falling back to
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypt_(C)#Traditional_DES-based_scheme">DES</a>
    when an unknown salt format was provided. The parameter is also made
    mandatory, hashing without a salt is now unsupported.</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5652">RFC 5652</a> is now exposed via the OpenSSL extension.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="misc"><a href="#misc">Misc</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.errorcontrol.php">error control operator</a>, aka <code>@</code>
    won't silence fatal errors anymore, meaning that poorly written webshells will have more chances
    to leave traces in your logs.</li>
<li><code>libxml_disable_entity_loader</code> is now deprecated, even if it's not (yet) reflected in php's documentation.
    This is acceptable since PHP8 now requires at least libxml 2.9.0,
    which comes with external entity loading disabled by default.</li>
<li>Access to undefined constants will throw an error, instead of being silently
  interpreted as a string, no more <code>SALT</code> being silently converted to <code>"SALT"</code>.</li>
<li><code>create_function</code> was <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/ee16d99504f0014c3d292809da927fb622293f41">removed</a>, closing its infamous code injection vector.</li>
<li><code>array_key_exists</code> throws when passed an array/object, instead of silently
  doing nonsense.</li>
<li>The <code>e</code> modifier in <code>mb_ereg_replace</code> has been removed.</li>
<li>Metadata associated with a phar will
  <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/phar_stop_autoloading_metadata">no longer be unserialized</a>,

<li><code>FILTER_SANITIZE_MAGIC_QUOTES</code>, <code>get_magic_quotes_gpc</code> and <code>get_magic_quotes_runtime</code> have been removed,
  people will now have to do proper sanitization instead.</li>
<li>As usual, a couple of memory safety issues were fixed,

    ported to php8!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="missed-opportunities"><a href="#missed-opportunities">Missed opportunities</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/engine_warnings#undefined_variable">Undefined
variables</a>, as
opposed to constants, are still not an error, meaning that things like <code>solt</code>
instead of <code>salt</code> might (and will) go unnoticed.</p>
<p>Converting an <code>Array</code> to a string will only yield a <code>Warning</code> instead of an
error, albeit that now that <code>__toString</code> <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/tostring_exceptions">can <em>finally</em>
throw</a>, it might hopefully change
in the near future.</p>
<p>Albeit significant <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/easy_userland_csprng">CSPRNG</a>
<a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/random-function-exceptions">improvements</a> have been
merged in PHP7, PHP8 didn't seize the opportunity to keep the momentum and to
aliases <code>rand</code> and <code>mt_rand</code> to <code>random_int</code>, like
<a href="https://snuffleupagus.readthedocs.io/features.html#weak-prng-via-rand-mt-rand">Snuffleupagus</a> is doing.</p>
<p>An other missed opportunity in my opinion is that there is <a href="https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=50715">still no
way</a> to disable some <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.php">PHP's wrappers</a>, except via
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.stream-wrapper-unregister.php"><code>stream_wrapper_unregister</code></a>
but this can be reversed with
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.stream-wrapper-restore.php"><code>stream_wrapper_restore</code></a>.
Wrappers are scary: the main use I've seen for the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.php.php#wrappers.php.filter"><code>filter://</code>
one</a> is
exfiltrating data via <code>php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/some/file</code>, and is a <a href="https://www.netsparker.com/blog/web-security/php-stream-wrappers/">decent
amount of</a>

<a href="https://gynvael.coldwind.pl/?lang=en&amp;id=671">stuff</a> lurking in the shadows.
Providing a way to reduce this attack surface (like making streams opt-in)
would be welcome.</p>

<p>I finally figured it out. I’m not an academic, I build apps. So, I wondered how I could apply Zettelkasten to my work.</p>
<p>I’m not just coding, I’m also receiving constructive user feedback. This is usually about bug reports and feature suggestions. However, sometimes I get flooded by emails and messages. There are more good features than time to build and every feature needs some serious thinking and planning. So, my role I cover here is a mix of developer and product manager.</p>
<p>I was using Jira, a project management software to collect, manage and plan feature ideas and bug reports. But it quickly grew to over 1000 items. It’s mostly useless now.</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://blog.noteplan.co/static/b88a1129c49f39649645d4c849897402/774b6/jira-screenshot.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>Then I started my Zettelkasten and I’m not opening Jira any more.</p>
<h2>What is Zettelkasten?</h2>
<p>German for ‘slip-box’. It’s a simple, but powerful note-taking system allowing you to build a second brain. The Zettelkasten was invented by Niklas Luhmann, a highly productive German sociologist. He published more than 70 books and 400 scholarly articles and attributed his productivity to his notes. His slip-box contained more than 90,000 notes.</p>
<p>Intentionally, the Zettelkasten fits and complements our imperfect and biased brains and I think that’s how it ‘just works’. Many good productivity principles are baked in.</p>
<h2>Here is how I translate it to my work</h2>
<p>In Luhmann’s work, Zettelkasten was used in an academic environment. Here is how I translate the academic Zettelkasten to a ‘Product Development’ Zettelkasten. On the left is Luhmann’s version and on the right mine:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Input:</strong> Reading books and academic articles = Feedback emails</li>
<li><strong>Capture:</strong> Literature notes on books = Feedback notes</li>
<li><strong>File notes and link:</strong> Permanent Zettelkasten notes are the same for me, short, atomic ideas for features, clarifications, question, interconnected where it makes sense.</li>
<li><strong>Interim Output:</strong> Manuscript for an article or book = Feature specification document</li>
<li><strong>Final Output:</strong> Final Draft for an article or book = Written code implementing a feature</li>
</ol>
<h2>The process is largely the same</h2>
<p>Every morning, when I read my emails, I take quick notes about the content and copy/paste the link to the original email (Gmail link in my case). My notes are very short and written in my words. Sometimes the title of the note is all I need, other times I elaborate a good idea or clue I found in the email. These notes are only temporary. I store them into an inbox folder at first (as recommended by GTD), waiting to be processed later.</p>
<p><strong>It’s critical to write all notes in your words</strong> and as short as possible, don’t copy and paste the content. It’s unlikely you read the full email again and often a waste of time. But just in case, you got the link.</p>
<p>Then, on the next morning, I process all accumulated inbox notes at once. By splitting the capturing from the processing process, your brain doesn’t have to switch contexts and you can work with less effort.</p>
<p>In that process I take the inbox note, quickly evaluate if it adds anything valuable to my system and either delete it or elaborate, then file it. If I decide there is something useful in it, I create a permanent slip-box note which contains a single, atomic idea. Again it’s written in my words. I look into my network of existing notes (sometimes using the search function) to find other notes which have the same context and link them together to a chain of thoughts with branches (not unlike GitHub).</p>
<p>During that process your brain often starts to have more ideas, so I create more permanent notes as good ideas come to me.</p>
<h2>How is this useful?</h2>
<p>After some time, you build a dense network of ideas. Clusters emerge. In my case, around feature ideas. If a particular feature has many connected notes, my understanding on that feature is probably very mature. I can browse through the notes (since they have clickable links) and create a draft for a specification document.</p>
<p>Without the Zettelkasten you would have to brainstorm and rely on your fragile memory to write that spec or worse, dig up the emails and read them <em>again</em>, out of context. So, naturally you spend much more time and miss important details.</p>
<p>And finally, you write well thought through code out of that specification document. The details are based on actual user feedback have matured over time.</p>
<h2>Where I’m now</h2>
<p>Today, I have 909 notes and I have used this system for a few months. I created several slip-box folders: features, bugs, general and business. Notes can be still interconnected between the folders, it’s just easier to find related end-points this way. In general you shouldn’t restrict yourself to specific topics though.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>I still read Twitter (despite my <a href="https://brianschrader.com/_drafts/retweeting/">efforts to quit entirely</a>), but I've stopped retweeting. My last retweet was on July 17th and it was of a tweet I wrote for <a href="https://adventurerscodex.com/">a company I co-own</a>. And if things continue as planned, that will be the last retweet I ever do.</p>
<h3>Why No Retweets?</h3>
<p>Retweets are Twitter's original sin. Akin to Facebook's Share, or Tumblr's Re-blog, the Retweet is what allows content on Twitter to spread virally. It allows for users to effortlessly spread false or misleading information with impunity and encourages readers to never go past the title of an article (despite <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2020/10/twitter-retweet-change-election.html">Twitter's admittedly laudable attempts</a> to address this issue). Retweets allow users to easily dunk on each other and act as super-spreaders of identity-reenforcing and tribalistic memes that only serve to make Twitter a worse platform.</p>
<p>Quote retweets are a little better (at least they require the user to express some opinion about the content they're spreading), but they still allow for the easy dunking that's a mainstay of the platform.</p>
<p>To their credit, Twitter has long known that the retweet button causes problems on their platform. The original designer of the feature has even said as much.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alexkantrowitz/how-the-retweet-ruined-the-internet">Chris Wetherell</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We might have just handed a 4-year-old a loaded weapon,” Wetherell recalled thinking as he watched the first Twitter mob use the tool he created. “That’s what I think we actually did.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both Pine.blog and Micro.blog don't have retweets, and Manton does a great job explaining why (I used the same reasoning for Pine.blog).<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><a href="https://www.manton.org/2016/11/22/fake-news-and.html">Manton Reece</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you have to put a little work into posting, you take it more seriously. I wonder if fake news would have spread so quickly on Facebook if it was a little more difficult to share an article before you’ve read more than the headline.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Putting in the extra effort to actually articulate an intelligible thought helps me better understand the content myself and it helps me gauge whether or not the given post is even worth sharing. On more than one occasion, I've stopped myself from sharing something because I realized that it just wasn't all that interesting.</p>
<h3>How I (Still) Use Twitter</h3>
<p>While I still read Twitter, the vast majority of my posts are cross-posted from <a href="https://pine.blog/u/sonicrocketman">my microblog</a>. I still favorite posts (because my favorites are automatically saved to Pinboard so I can find them later), but for the most part, my interactions are read-only.</p>
<p>Because I spend most of my "social media time" either reading articles on <a href="https://pine.blog/">Pine.blog</a> or browsing <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a>, reading Twitter now feels like wading through a nuance-lacking, toxic cesspit rather than acccessing the real-time information platform I once knew and loved, which in turn drives me further away from the platform. I see people I follow there cooking amazing meals, telling fanciful stories, sharing hilarious memes, but all of that is drowned out by the hate and vitriol in every next post.</p>
<p>With all that said though, I do still share stuff on the Web. I just do it by writing a post.</p>
<div>
<p><img alt="A sample pseudo-retweet" src="https://brianschrader.com/images/blog/pseudo-retweet.png"></p><center><small>I'd love a browser plugin that removes the Retweet button and hides all retweets. It seems like a few exist, but none that I tried worked. Presumably Twitter tries to circumvent them.</small></center>
</div>

<p>Virality is a fact of life on the Web; neither innately good nor bad. For too long we've seen it as something to be harnessed, to utilize. But a virus is incredibly difficult to control and, like with today's real-world troubles, a pandemic of memes and satire does enormous harm to our individual health and to the health of our society.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>tl;dr Pandemics are bad. Both online and in meatspace. We should limit their spread and stop retweeting.</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Pine.blog will show you when someone retweets or re-posts your blog posts if you allow for Webmentions, though I'm considering letting users configure this behavior. Retweets also poison the mind of the poster, not just the reader.
</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> In an effort to be transparent, I have asked others to retweet my posts before an an attempt to gain some traction outside my bubble. I'm going to stop doing that too.

<ul>
<li>Measure performance! If you don’t measure it’s the same as doing nothing.</li>
<li>You can optimize your React performance by improving <strong>what</strong> (🤔) and <strong>which</strong> (🧙) components render.</li>
<li>
<p>🧙 To improve <strong>which</strong> component renders you can use</p>
<ul>
<li><code>React.memo</code></li>
<li><code>useCallback</code></li>
<li><code>useMemo</code></li>
<li>Make sure your props have stable references</li>
<li>Virtualization</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>🤔 To improve <strong>what</strong> components render you should</p>
<ul>
<li>identify the slow components</li>
<li>simplify, use more efficient abstractions, make smaller trees, etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In general computer programs can be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>io-bound</strong>: spend most of their time making inputs and outputs</li>
<li><strong>cpu-bound</strong>: spend most of their time making calculations</li>
</ul>
<p>And how do these translate into Front End apps and in particular React apps?</p>
<h2 id="io-performance-problems-in-react"><a href="#io-performance-problems-in-react" aria-label="io performance problems in react permalink"></a>io performance problems in React</h2>
<ul>
<li>Browser apps can be <strong>io-bounded</strong> mostly in terms of asynchronous http calls.</li>
<li>a poor management of these network requests can slow down your app</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="potential-solutions"><a href="#potential-solutions" aria-label="potential solutions permalink"></a>Potential solutions</h3>
<p>Although this will not be the focus of this post let’s quickly cover some
important areas where solutions and improvements might be found for io-bound
problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>lazy load as much as you can.</li>
<li>careful with the initial load of assets and also backend requests.</li>
<li>reduce the amount of times you load highly static stuff (select options, configurations, etc)</li>
<li>debounce the amount of times you make certain requests.</li>
<li>parallelize request as much as possible via <code>Promise.all</code>.</li>
<li>make your critical BE endpoints more efficient (i.e. by tweaking DB accesses and such).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cpu-performance-problems-in-react"><a href="#cpu-performance-problems-in-react" aria-label="cpu performance problems in react permalink"></a>CPU performance problems in React</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This is going to be the main focus of this post.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before talking about performance we need to define it in a more concrete way:</p>
<ul>
<li>browser apps are <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30932870/why-doesnt-javascript-get-its-own-thread-in-common-browsers">single thread</a> programs for the most part.</li>
<li>scripting, i.e. Javascript, DOM rendering, event handling, etc; all run in the same thread.</li>
<li>if a Javascript module is slow it can block the main thread.</li>
<li>if the main thread is blocked then the UI will seem unresponsive (<strong>fps</strong> will drop).</li>
<li>unresponsive UIs are one of the worst offenders in terms of <strong>User Experience</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This all boils down to the concept of <code>fps</code> or <strong>Frames Per Second</strong>.
Responsive UIs will deliver a minimum of 30 fps or more ideally 60 fps, this means
that every frame of your app, even the more demanding code paths, should compute in <strong>30 ms or less</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your Javascript is slow it might cause “frames to be dropped” which means
computing a frame in more than 30 ms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To fully understand how this applies to React we need to understand how React works
and what React’s <strong>render and commit phase</strong> are but in short we can say that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a React component update is triggered then the <strong>entire sub tree needs to be
rendered in less than 30ms</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This becomes specially problematic when you have complex and long component structures
such as Tables, Trees and Lists and in which sometimes (for example the first time) you will
need to re render large parts of them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> we should figure out which expensive interactions are dropping frames,
measure them to confirm and fix them.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="react-render-and-commit-phase"><a href="#react-render-and-commit-phase" aria-label="react render and commit phase permalink"></a>React render and commit phase</h2>
<p>React works (at a high level) in two phases</p>
<p><strong>Render phase:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Happens when a component updates i.e. props or hooks changed.</li>
<li>React traverses the component sub tree rendering each child and computing the virtual DOM (VDOM) sub tree.</li>
<li>Only the “dirty” sub tree needs to be recomputed i.e. the updated component parents might not need to be re rendered.</li>
<li>This phase is proportional to the size of the sub tree being rendered.</li>
<li>This phase is also proportional to how expensive it is to compute each child component.</li>
<li>We can give React hints to make this process more efficient i.e. <code>React.memo</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Commit phase:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The render phase outputs a new virtual DOM of the entire UI.</li>
<li>In the commit phase Reacts compares the new tree with the previous one (VDOM diffing).</li>
<li>React calculates the minimum DOM mutations needed to reflect the new VDOM tree.</li>
<li>React mutates the DOM.</li>
<li>Your UI is now updated.</li>
<li>This phase is pretty efficient by default.</li>
</ul>
<p>This whole process needs to happen in less than 30 or 16 ms (30 fps and 60 fps respectively) for your UI to be considered
responsive, as you can see there’s a lot of work and that work is proportional to the size of your app.</p>
<p>We will explore ways to make mostly the <strong>Render phase</strong> more efficient but first let’s discuss
how to measure and how to find out what are the slow parts of our app and how bad they are.</p>
<h2 id="measuring"><a href="#measuring" aria-label="measuring permalink"></a>Measuring</h2>
<p>In 2020 we have pretty solid tools for measuring browser side performance, these
are the ones I use the most:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chrome dev tool’s Performance tab.</li>
<li>React dev tool’s Performance tab.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="chrome-dev-tools-performance-tab"><a href="#chrome-dev-tools-performance-tab" aria-label="chrome dev tools performance tab permalink"></a>Chrome dev tool’s Performance tab</h3>
<p>This is the most comprehensive tool, it is useful for any browser application,
it measures frames per second, records stack traces, identifies slow / hot parts of your code,
and much more. The main UI is the <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html">flame chart</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html#profiling-components-with-the-chrome-performance-tab">good doc</a>
of Chrome’s Performance Tab applied to React.</p>
<h3 id="react-dev-tools-performance-tab"><a href="#react-dev-tools-performance-tab" aria-label="react dev tools performance tab permalink"></a>React dev tool’s Performance tab</h3>
<p>You need to install the <a href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/08/15/new-react-devtools.html">React dev tool extension</a> in your browser.</p>
<p>It specializes the information in the Chrome dev tool’s Performance tab to
React. You can see the different <strong>commit phases</strong> and the Javascript code that was run in its respective
<strong>render phase</strong> through a <strong>flame chart</strong>.</p>
<p>Through this tool you can easily find out:</p>
<ul>
<li>when a component re renders</li>
<li>what props changed</li>
<li>what hooks changed i.e. state, context, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check the <a href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/09/10/introducing-the-react-profiler.html">introductory post</a> for more information.</p>
<h3 id="measuring-1"><a href="#measuring-1" aria-label="measuring 1 permalink"></a>Measuring</h3>
<p>This is the <strong>methodology</strong> I like to use when measuring front end applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>identify the problem</strong>: identify page interactions that make the UI feel unresponsive.</li>
<li><strong>create a hypothesis</strong>: optionally, we might have some ideas where the problem might be.</li>
<li><strong>measure</strong>: verify the problem by measuring and looking at important metrics such as <strong>fps</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>measure</strong>: identify problematic pieces of code, optionally: validate your hypothesis.</li>
<li><strong>create a solution</strong>: apply a solution based off the previous steps</li>
<li><strong>measure the solution</strong>: validate that the problem has been resolved or alleviated by looking at the important metrics.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>If you optimize something without measuring then you are practically doing nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There might be cases where the problem is super obvious and I won’t tell you that going straight
to fixing it is naturally bad, but most of the problems are not obvious and measuring will be
cornerstone of the performance improvement process.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you measure you can later tell your users, stakeholders and more importantly your <strong>boss
that you have improved the performance of a given area of your app by x%</strong> which is always a good
way of communicating upwards what we accomplish inside the rabbit hole.</p>
<h2 id="general-solutions-to-cpu-bound-problems-in-react-applications"><a href="#general-solutions-to-cpu-bound-problems-in-react-applications" aria-label="general solutions to cpu bound problems in react applications permalink"></a>General solutions to cpu-bound problems in React applications</h2>
<p>Now that we have measured and identified the problematic areas let’s cover
potential solutions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can optimize your React performance by
improving <strong>what</strong> components render and
<strong>which</strong> components render.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="-improving-what-components-render"><a href="#-improving-what-components-render" aria-label=" improving what components render permalink"></a>🤔 Improving <em>what</em> components render</h3>
<p>Identifying the slow parts of our React app will usually
point out to some particular components that are slow to render
(or that have too many instances in a single page, more on this in the <strong>which</strong> section).</p>
<p>There might be a number of reasons those components are slow, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>they do blocking calculations</li>
<li>they render large trees</li>
<li>they use expensive / non efficient libraries</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these boil down to improving how fast your components render,
sometimes critical components cannot rely on too complicated libraries
and so you need to go back to basic and roll your own simpler implementation.</p>
<p>I have experienced something like this when using <a href="https://formik.org/">Formik</a> (which I love)
or should I say abusing Formik on several cells of every single row of a complex table.</p>
<p>You can go a long way making your components more efficient but eventually you will need
to focus on <strong>which</strong> components render:</p>
<h3 id="🧙-improving-which-components-render"><a href="#%F0%9F%A7%99-improving-which-components-render" aria-label="🧙 improving which components render permalink"></a>🧙 Improving <em>which</em> components render</h3>
<p>There are two broad categories where we can improve this aspect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtualization</li>
<li>Prop optimization</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="virtualization"><a href="#virtualization" aria-label="virtualization permalink"></a>Virtualization</h4>
<p>It means <strong>only render what is visible in the viewport</strong>, i.e. only render the
table rows that the user can see or the list items the user can see.</p>
<p>This is great because it can be applied to complex UIs without going through the <strong>what</strong> step,
although I recommend it; and modern libraries tend to have decent support for virtualizing
your tables and lists. A good example of this is <a href="https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized">react-virtualized</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Virtualizing means that we <strong>reduce the amount of components React needs to render in a given frame</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="props-optimization"><a href="#props-optimization" aria-label="props optimization permalink"></a>Props Optimization</h4>
<p>React tries to make your components look like pure functions but still will try to render
more times than it should.</p>
<h5 id="code-classlanguage-textreactmemocode"><a href="#code-classlanguage-textreactmemocode" aria-label="code classlanguage textreactmemocode permalink"></a><code>React.memo</code></h5>
<p>Most components in React can be <strong>memoized</strong>, which means that they do not have internal side effects
or depend on any external side effects so that we can guarantee than <strong>with the same props the component
will return the same tree</strong> (hooks, state and context are still respected though).</p>
<p>For that we can use <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactmemo">React.memo</a>.
This tells React to skip re rendering these memoized components if their
props didn’t change.</p>
<h5 id="fake-prop-changes-code-classlanguage-textusecallbackcode"><a href="#fake-prop-changes-code-classlanguage-textusecallbackcode" aria-label="fake prop changes code classlanguage textusecallbackcode permalink"></a>Fake prop changes: <code>useCallback</code></h5>
<p>Additionally we have the problem of <strong>fake prop changes</strong> which means that although
the content of a given prop didn’t change, the reference did. The most classic example
of this is the event handler one:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>MyComponent</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>onChange</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>e</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>e<span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>&lt;</span>input onChange<span>=</span><span>{</span>onChange<span>}</span> <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>onChange</code> callback, although semantically and content wise will be the same on every render, will be
be stored in a completely separate memory direction so React will detect it as different from the previous one.</p>
<p>This is related to how <code>React.memo</code> does shallow comparison by default (although there’s no good way of
deeply comparing functions in Javascript AFAIK).</p>
<p>An easy fix for this is to use <code>useCallback</code> which was designed exactly for this:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>MyComponent</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> onChange <span>=</span> <span>useCallback</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>e<span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>&lt;</span>input onChange<span>=</span><span>{</span>onChange<span>}</span> <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h5 id="fake-prop-changes-code-classlanguage-textusememocode"><a href="#fake-prop-changes-code-classlanguage-textusememocode" aria-label="fake prop changes code classlanguage textusememocode permalink"></a>Fake prop changes: <code>useMemo</code></h5>
<p>A similar problem can rise when building complex data structures and not memoizing them
correctly before …</p></section></div>

  <p>For a startup employee, learning about your company’s initial public offering (IPO) is an exciting time. But it’s also overwhelming from a financial planning perspective. You have a variety of different equity grants, and you must decide what to do with each one. How many stock options should you exercise and sell, and when? What will your tax obligations be, and how can you minimize them?</p>
  <p>This guide covers what a startup employee needs to know to make well-informed decisions about all of this. We’ll start with tax considerations around exercising and selling stock. Then, we’ll discuss strategies and timelines for selling stock after the IPO. Finally, we’ll go over ways to further minimize your tax burden after selling.
  </p>
</section></div><h3>Taxes</h3><div><section>
<p>Money made from selling stock is taxed either as ordinary income (i.e. <span>federal<label for="sn-federal"></label></span><span>In 2020, the federal tax brackets
        were: 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37%. Your bracket depends on your income and filing status; more

      <span>state<label for="sn-state"></label></span>
      
      <span>In 2020, California state tax brackets
        <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/california-state-tax#:~:text=California%20state%20tax%20brackets%20are,subject%20to%20California%20state%20tax.">ranged</a>from
        1% to 12.3%. New York state tax brackets

      income taxes), or as long-term capital gains. If you acquire a stock (e.g. by exercising an option or vesting an
      RSU) and hold it for over a year before selling it, then your profit is classified as a long-term capital gain.
      Profits from stocks held for less than a year are short-term capital gains, and they’re taxed at the same rate
      as
      ordinary income.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long-term capital gains are taxed at about half the
      <span>ordinary income tax rate<label for="sn-oitr"></label></span>
      
      <span>For unmarried individuals, the long-term capital gains federal tax rate
        <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/capital-gains-tax-rates">is</a>: 0% for income below
        $40k; 15% for income
        between $40k-$441,450; 20% for income exceeding $441,450. In California, though, you’ll have to <a href="https://pocketsense.com/capital-gains-taxes-state-california-8405869.html">pay</a> additional
        state income tax on all capital gains (see footnote 2).</span>
      . So, in general, to minimize your tax
      burden, maximize your long-term capital gains.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let’s look at how this plays out for ISOs, NSOs, and RSUs.

      Employee stock options represent the right to purchase a certain number of shares of your company at a certain
      price, once the options have vested. There are two types—ISOs and NSOs—and early-stage companies will typically
      issue a mix of both to their employees.
    </p>
    <p>
      For each tranche of options that you’ve been issued, be aware of three key numbers:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your strike price (aka exercise price): how much you pay to purchase each share.</li>
      <li>The 409A value (aka fair market value) of the shares, as of the time you exercise the options. For private
        companies, the 409A value is an independent appraisal of how much the private company’s stock is worth. After
        the
        IPO, this value becomes
        <span>the company’s public stock price.<label for="sn-psp"></label></span>
        
        <span>Leading up to the IPO, the fair market value of your shares will likely rise greatly
          towards the company’s preferred price (or at least fluctuate). These fluctuations may greatly impact your tax
          calculations, and your company's finance team should keep you up-to-date on them.</span></li>
      <li>Your sale price: the price at which you later sell the shares.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      On a high level, here is the difference between ISOs and NSOs:
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>For NSOs</b>
    </p><ul>
      <li>Pay ordinary income tax on (409A value - exercise price) when you exercise your options. So, if you pay $2 to
        purchase each share and the 409A value is $10, then you’re taxed on the $8 spread.</li>
      <li>Pay
        <span>capital gains tax<label for="sn-cgt"></label></span>
        
        <span>Depending whether you held the shares for over a year before selling them, you’ll either
          pay long-term capital gains or ordinary income tax on them.</span>
        on (sale price - 409A at the time of exercise) when you sell the shares. So, if you exercise the shares when the
        409A value is $10, then sell those shares for $50, then you’ll be taxed on the $40 capital gain.</li>
    </ul>
    

    <p>
      <b>For ISOs</b>
    </p><ul>
      <li>Pay no tax when you exercise—unless you trigger the AMT (details below)</li>
      <li>Pay long-term capital gains tax on (sale price - exercise price) when you sell—if the shares are sold at least
        one year after exercising, and at least two years after your options were granted. Otherwise, (sale price -
        exercise price) will be taxed as short-term capital gains (roughly ordinary income). </li>
    </ul>

<p>
      Upon exercising your ISOs, you will likely qualify for the Alternative Minimum Tax, or
      <span>AMT.<label for="sn-amt"></label></span>
      
      <span>Back in 1969, 155 individuals with incomes over $200,000 managed to pay zero federal income
        taxes, triggering popular outrage. The AMT was introduced to prevent this from happening again.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The AMT is calculated based on the bargain element: the (409A value - exercise price). You owe AMT if:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Your total bargain value ( [409A value - exercise price] * total ISOs exercised ) exceeds the AMT exemption
        amount (which
        was
        <span>$72,900 for unmarried individuals<label for="sn-amt"></label></span>
        
        <span>For married couples filing jointly, the 2020 AMT exemption amount was $113,400.</span>
        in 2020).

      </li>
      <li>
        The tax you owe under the <span>AMT calculation<label for="sn-amtcalc"></label></span>
        
        <span>We won’t discuss how to calculate your exact AMT burden in this article, but it will come
          out to 26-28% of your total bargain value.

        </span>
        exceeds the tax you owe under regular tax calculations.
      </li>
    </ol>
  

    <p>
      You will have to pay AMT when you file your tax return for the year that you exercise your ISOs (it is not
      withheld at the time you exercise), so make sure to plan accordingly.
    </p>
</section></div><h4>AMT Credits<br></h4><div><section> 
<p>
      Upon exercising your ISOs, you pay AMT . Then, when you
      sell those shares, you’re taxed again on your capital gains. To lessen the blow of thus being taxed twice on ISOs,
      Congress introduced AMT credits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose you paid $5000 in AMT in 2019. In any subsequent year where you don't owe AMT (say, 2020), you might be
      able to get back some or all of that $5000. There are a few
      conditions for getting this tax credit:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>You can't owe AMT in 2020.</li>
      <li>The maximum amount of AMT credit you can claim for 2020 is [regular tax bill for 2020 - AMT amount for 2020].
        After you claim your credits for 2020, any of the original $5000 that's left over can be used toward a
        subsequent year's tax deduction.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      There are many other caveats that may warrant speaking with a financial advisor. But the bottom line is: you may
      want to try to strategically maximize the amount of AMT credit that you can claim later. Or, you can limit the
      number of ISOs that you exercise and stay below the AMT exemption amount (thus avoiding the AMT altogether).
    </p>
</section></div><h4>Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)<br></h4><div><section> 
<p>
      RSUs turn into shares of your company’s stock when they vest. They’re typically issued by companies valued at over
      $1 billion.
    </p>
    <p>
      RSUs are subject to either single- or double-trigger vesting. Single-trigger RSUs can vest before IPO. This means
      you’ll owe taxes on them as they vest (because you’re coming into ownership of new shares of stock). However, if
      the company is still private, you won’t be able to sell those shares to make money to pay the taxes you owe on
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s why many companies instead offer double-trigger RSUs, which only vest after the IPO. That way, you’ll only
      owe taxes once the company is public and you can actually sell those shares. So, for the year that your company
      IPOs, be prepared to pay taxes on
      <span>any double-trigger RSUs that you vest.<label for="sn-dtr"></label></span>
      
      <span>Your RSUs may vest either on IPO day or after the lockup period, depending on the

    </p>
    <p>
      When your RSUs vest (whether before or after IPO), you’ll owe ordinary income tax on the

      <span>As a reminder, the 409A value after IPO is equivalent to the company’s public stock
        price.</span>
      Then, when you sell those shares, your profit (i.e. [sale price - 409A value as of the day the shares vested])
      <span>will be taxed as capital gains.<label for="sn-wtcp"></label></span>

      You can actually exempt your stock from all the federal taxes we’ve discussed above, if it counts as qualified
      small business stock (QSBS). Your stock might qualify as QSBS if:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>At the time that your stock was issued (i.e. when you exercised your options), your company’s gross assets did
        not exceed $50 million.</li>
      <li>You’ve held the stock for at least five years before selling it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There are a number of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qsbs-qualified-small-business-stock.asp"></a>other caveats. But, if
      you can get QSBS treatment, you’ll almost certainly save a lot of
      money in taxes.
    </p>
</section></div><h3>Selling your stock<br></h3><div><section>
<p>
      With these tax considerations in mind, let’s discuss plans for selling your shares.
    </p>
    <p>The soonest that you can sell your shares is after the lockup period. The lockup period lasts around six months,
      starting from the IPO date, and is meant to prevent employees from flooding the market with their shares
      <span>(and thus lowering the stock price).<label for="sn-lup"></label></span>
      
      <span>This is generally true for traditional IPOs. If your company is going public via a direct
        listing, there might not be a lockup period.</span>
      After the lockup period, employees generally employ one of a few selling strategies:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sell most of their equity immediately.</li>
      <li>Sell most of their shares as soon as they qualify for long-term capital gains tax treatment.</li>
      <li>Plan to sell a constant number …</li></ul></section></div></div></div>

		</header>
		<p>Yesterday I faced a version control situation I rarely face.</p>

<p>It showed me that I may rely a little too much on the green light from CI tools like CircleCI and GitHub Actions when deciding whether it’s safe to merge a branch.</p>

<p>Here’s what happened:</p>

<ol>
  <li>My colleague added new <code>expect</code> clauses to a test, plus the code to <strong>pass it</strong>.</li>
  <li>They merged this into the main branch via a PR.</li>
  <li>Later, I forked off of the main branch.</li>
  <li>I added <strong>more new clauses</strong> to the test my colleague had earlier modified.<br>I worked on it for the rest of the day.</li>
  <li>I made a <strong>pull request</strong>.</li>
  <li>Next, two colleagues reviewed my work and approved it on GitHub.<br>All the pre-merge checks on CircleCI were passing, including tests and style checks.<br>I rebased and decided to save the merge for the morning.</li>
  <li>Soon after, an error was found related to the code the first colleague had deployed.<br>They <strong>reverted</strong> the PR they had merged on Day 1.</li>
  <li>Not long after, I checked my PR again - there were no merge conflicts.<br><strong>I merged my code</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>An hour or so later, another colleague tells me that, according to CircleCI, a test I wrote was failing on the main branch. How could this be, they said? It appears to have been passing on the branch it came from!</p>

<p>What is the cause of this mysterious failure?</p>

<p>I’d recently touched that test, so I looked at the error and quickly worked out what it was: The test I’d added to was failing because one of it’s <code>expect</code> clauses relied on code which had been been reverted - it was no longer a valid expectation. GitHub didn’t run a new diff on my PR after the removal of the clause in question from the main branch; the reverted test code simply looks ‘unchanged’ in the diff, as if it had been and was still there.</p>

<p>I didn’t remove it, I didn’t rebase, and my PR ended up re-adding the recently-removed <code>expect</code> clause even though it didn’t appear to.</p>

<p>Is there a lesson to be learned here?</p>

<p>On one hand, the process is working. There was a merge error caused by the <code>git</code> equivalent of a race condition, we were told about it, and we were able to resolve it. Why bother running tests on the main branch before you deploy unless you are concerned that there is a chance they’ll fail?</p>

<p>Maybe the lesson is to keep on doing what we’re doing.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the process felt like it was disrupting the order of things. Something like this is often said: “if you have a reliable QA and CI process, then if something is on the main branch it should be deployable.” And yet here was an anomalous case which suggested otherwise.</p>

<p>Perhaps, then, the lesson is that our QA and CI process isn’t robust enough. Should CI create a merged branch behind-the-scenes and run tests on <em>that</em> before allowing the branch to be merged?</p>

<p>I’m not sure. In the meantime, while I try to decide what the lesson is, I think I’ll just rebase my branches more often.</p>

<h2><a name="the-biggest-tech-mafia-youve-never-heard-of"></a>The biggest tech mafia you've never heard of</h2>
<p>A Stanford dropout founder. "AI" technology. Recruits fresh out of MIT and Harvard. Skyrocketing valuations, huge paychecks, and a lightning-fast culture. All the makings of a legendary tech startup story. Was this Yahoo? Nope. Snapchat? Try again.</p>
<p>This was Trilogy Software in the 90s.</p>
<p>Although their glory has long since faded, their impact remains. Here's an incomplete list of Trilogy mafia members:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elie Seidman, the CEO of Tinder</li>
<li>Cyrus Massoumi and Nick Ganju, the founders of ZocDoc. They had shared a desk together at Trilogy.</li>
<li>Henry Ward, CEO and founder of Carta</li>
<li>John Lilly, former CEO of Mozilla, investor with Greylock Partners, and founder of Reactivity (acquired by Cisco).</li>
<li>Andy Palmer, CEO of Tamr Inc., former CEO of Vertica (acquired), and major angel investor (invested in Carta in part due to his connection with Henry).</li>
</ul>
<p>Crunchbase has a list of Trilogy mafia founded companies <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/hub/trilogy-alumni-founded-companies#section-leaderboard">here</a>. There are 87 entries.</p>
<p>All in all, they are one of tech's most successful, albeit relatively unknown, "mafias". Their story is a fascinating dive into the dot-com boom tech scene, and holds lessons on recruitment and culture that founders will still find relevant today. How do tech mafias form?</p>
<h2><a name="what-was-trilogy"></a>What Was Trilogy?</h2>
<p>"Trilogy Development Group" was founded in 1989 by Joe Liemandt, a Stanford CS student who dropped out to start the company. He brought along 5 classmates to join him in Austin, Texas, where the cost of living was cheap and the taxes were lower.</p>
<p>From these humble beginnings, Trilogy became a 90s pioneer of enterprise software. Their main product was "config-price-quote" software, which allowed sales forces to accurately quote and configure complex solutions such as mainframes, central office switches, airplanes, and automobiles. In fact, their software could even identify and recommend the ideal combination of products and services for each customer. At the time, this was a game-changer for their clients.</p>
<p>They also built sales compensation software, which allowed sales leaders and HR teams to move sales commissions from spreadsheets to a software database and workflow engine. Their main clients were Fortune 500 companies, especially in the auto and airline sectors.</p>
<p>Although not the "coolest" product, Trilogy was wildly successful. By the mid 1990s they had grown to $250M in revenue, were valued at well over a billion dollars, and Joe Liemandt became the youngest self-made man to enter the Forbes 400. In 1996 he graced <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2018/11/19/holy-cow-no-ones-done-this/#6700faa92927">the cover of the magazine</a>, with a net worth of $500 million.</p>
<p><img src="https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5bef0d784bbe6f78bda861c1/960x0.jpg?fit=scale" alt="https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5bef0d784bbe6f78bda861c1/960x0.jpg?fit=scale"></p>
<p>During this late 90's golden age they became famous for lavish parties, furious recruiting at college campuses, and massive onboardings — at one point they onboarded 250 people at once, a 50% increase in their headcount. They even spun off a publicly traded subsidiary, an early B2B marketplace for computer parts called PCOrder.com. It was the best of times for Trilogy... until the dot-com crash. PCOrder.com's stock price fell to near 0, Trilogy's valuation fell as well, and the company never regained the same stature. By 2001, Liedmandt had fallen off the Forbes 400, and many employees left or were let go, though the company never fully shut down.</p>
<p>At the time, it was a heavy loss for the burgeoning Austin tech scene.</p>
<h2><a name="trilogy-university-birthplace-of-the-mafia"></a>Trilogy University: Birthplace of the Mafia</h2>
<p>During their golden age, Trilogy was a recruitment machine, more than tripling their headcount in under three years. Liemandt wanted top talent, but they were competing for an extremely limited pool of computer science graduates, and couldn't pay as much as the "safe", established tech players of the 90s. So, they developed a pitch that distinguished them from the competition:</p>
<p>"Rather than paying you lots of money and stock options to pound out code for eight hours a day, we'll give you a ton of responsibility right away. You can lead projects, build new products, and even start a company. Have at it! Oh yeah, and we'll spend an average of $10,000 per recruit flying you out to Austin where you can play roulette with the CEO before you decide."</p>
<p>This was key. Trilogy was selecting for big risk-takers with an entrepreneur's mindset at the top of their recruitment funnel.</p>
<p>Once these recruits (all fresh out of college) got to Austin, they were enrolled at Trilogy University. This corporate bootcamp, modeled after Marine Corps training, was possibly Trilogy's greatest innovation, and participants cite its influence as having a huge impact on their careers. It lasted 12 weeks, and during that time employees would be split into 80 different teams working in intense R&amp;D projects for Trilogy, some of which became separate companies under the Trilogy umbrella. Classes started at 8am and went to midnight. You would spend almost all your waking hours with your team, and the bonds formed here ran deep.</p>
<p>One participant, Vince Mallet, recalls: “on the second day, we were all asked to tell the most significant emotional experience of our lives.” The first month focused on this emotional bonding, and instilling the values of Trilogy: humility, teamwork, customer-obsession, and, most of all, risk-taking. Employees say the bonds formed just during this first month persisted through their time at Trilogy and beyond, even as they eventually split off into different teams or left the company.</p>
<p>In month two, recruits "have to come up with a frame-breaking great new business idea." They have to come up with an idea, create a business model for it, build the product, and develop the marketing plan. It's wasn't hypothetical either. Liemandt hand-picked the best products to launch. By month three- graduation month, most employees are picked by or matched with different teams at Trilogy and graduate from the university. Some continue to work on their project, if it was in the lucky 15% selected to go on.</p>
<p>Trilogy University lived the work hard, play hard culture. The rigorous program was tempered by luxurious amenities like company cab cards to travel anywhere in Austin for free, sponsored trips to the beach and Las Vegas, more snacks than a convenience store, and free kegs of beer every Friday. It was 90s dot-com boom excess from start to finish.</p>
<p>In this environment, it's easy to see how risk-taking fresh graduates could be transformed into creative, effective entrepreneurs with incredible bonds to their fellow Trilogy University alums — all the makings for a future tech mafia. As Trilogy declined in the early 2000s, many of these employees left to start ventures that seeded the early Austin tech scene.</p>
<h2><a name="the-trilogy-mafia-impact"></a>The Trilogy Mafia Impact</h2>
<p><em>"Liemandt knows most of the kids he's hiring are too smart to work for him — or anyone else — for long. "There are a lot of people here to learn how to start a software company," he says. "That's great." He says he'd rather get a few years of boundless entrepreneurial energy from his employees than get many years of mediocre performance."</em></p>
<p>This except from a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2018/11/19/holy-cow-no-ones-done-this/#6700faa92927">Forbes article</a> proclaiming Liemandt as "computerdom's newest magnate" foreshadows the massive impact that the team he put together at Trilogy would have. For example, Trilogy's eventual decline was Austin's gain. Trilogy introduced over a thousand entrepreneurial, creative, and techhnically skilled people to Texas, like Joshua Baer, founder of Austin technology incubator Capital Factory and Heather Brunner, CEO of WP Engine.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.statesman.com/article/20120901/NEWS/309012327">This article</a> from the Austin Statesman cites Trilogy's lasting influence on the city. "Austin high-tech recruiter Marc Davis, himself a Trilogy alumnus, counts more than <strong>four dozen</strong> Austin tech companies that have Trilogy veterans in top leadership roles. Among those where Trilogy veterans populate the upper ranks: HomeAway, Bazaarvoice, WhaleShark Media (RetailMeNot), <a href="http://indeed.com/">Indeed.com</a>, <a href="http://vast.com/">Vast.com</a> and Socialware."</p>
<p>Their influence extends beyond Austin. For example, Bryon Krug appears as an eager college senior at Carnegie-Mellon and a potential Trilogy recruit in <a href="https://www.wiley.com/college/man/schermerhorn332879/site/student/ic/oneman.htm">this Rolling Stone piece</a> from 1998, titled "Wooing the Geeks". He ended up joining Trilogy, then went on to found his own publishing company, and co-founded CEG Solutions in 2008, a major energy efficiency company where he still serves as president.</p>
<p>As for Trilogy's founder, Joe Liemandt? He's back on the Forbes 400, with a net worth of over $3.5 billion, thanks to his private equity investments in software companies.</p>
<p>There are some parallels between the Trilogy mafia and their more famous counterpart, the <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2007/11/13/magazines/fortune/paypal_mafia.fortune/index.htm">Paypal mafia</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Both emerged at around the same time — the early 2000s, as the tech industry recovered and matured post dot-com crash.</li>
<li>In both cases, there was a mass exodus. Trilogy never got to a successful exit and started shedding employees. After PayPal's successful acquisition by eBay, the original team felt stifled under their new, more corporate bosses, and left.</li>
<li>Both companies selected for entrepreneurial people, then gave them confidence in their abilities, whether it was through Trilogy University's "build a company in a month" program or the near-bankruptcy battles fought at PayPal.</li>
<li>Perhaps most importantly, the founders encouraged tight bonds among their employees, all of whom skewed extremely young.</li>
</ul>
<p>Could this be the formula to build a new tech mafia?</p>
<p>Tech mafias are rare, and it's not obvious one has formed until years later. The first article on the success of PayPal's former employees was from 2007, 5 years after their acquisition. Spotting one is harder than finding a unicorn. In this case, you're looking for a whole herd.</p>
<p>In terms of tech mafias operating today, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/technology/silicon-valley-network-mafias.html">Uber and Airbnb have been selected as likely candidates</a>. Andrew Chen, who led Rider Growth at Uber and now is a partner at a16z, estimates that two dozen venture-backed startups have come out of Uber so far. Clearly, their alumni are already adding an extra jolt of entrepreneurial energy to the Valley, but what about outside California? Could some city be flying under the radar, in the way Austin was before Trilogy? Epic Games, for example, has …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div id="post-body"><p>One question I often ask potential software engineering candidates is to pinpoint the percentage of code coverage in an ideal project. Interestingly enough, many of them jump to the sky with numbers beyond 90%. They would start preaching how well-tested code is more reliable and brings more value to all stakeholders. When I ask about the current projects they work on, the reality looks a bit more down to earth.</p><p>Want to know my answer? I'd say it's <strong>around 66.7%</strong>.</p><p>The reasons for that vary, but allow me to be blunt and say that <strong>1/3 of the code every software project is irrelevant, buggy, overly complicated, or simply sucks.</strong> It has a reason to be where it is, but chances are, one year down the road, it will become a liability. Being dogmatic about tests and covering every line will only make it more difficult to get rid of it.</p><p>See, no two lines of code are equal in value and importance. Adding a new feature to an existing application affects its capabilities only marginally. However, it takes a proportionally large amount of time to develop and integrate due to the existing complexity. The bigger the complexity, the longer it takes to introduce new functionality. By the time the feature finds itself in production, it may as well be already irrelevant.</p><blockquote>The only sure-fire way to improve code coverage (and by that keep software relevant) is to identify and remove the unnecessary code.</blockquote><p>How do you identify irrelevant code? Don't search for it. Instead, let it reveal itself to you. One dimension of software that few teams make good use of, is its history. Git is a great analysis tool. Start using it not only to prevent future problems but also, to understand where and how often certain parts of the code change over time.</p><p>Chances are, you will find pieces of code that have undergone fewer changes than the rest in long periods. Those are the pillars of your application - the 2/3s that <strong>must be well-tested</strong>.</p><p>You will also find others where changes occur more or less every week. Ask yourselves whether those are still relevant, both from a technical and business perspective. Adding tests for the sake of coverage would have the opposite effect of increasing the code quality. In a perfectly-design software project, the part that is allowed to change most often is the configuration. A simple analysis of the code change frequency would show whether that is the case. If it isn't, try separating the moving parts from the core logic. If this is not feasible either, most probably those portions of the code don't belong to the codebase anyway. Turning them into interchangeable scripts (even stored in a separate repository) is one way of tackling them in their own right.</p><p>Let's not get too much into technical details. I have already alluded to the work of <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamTornhill">Adam Tornhill</a> on code analysis in a previous post of mine:</p><figure><a href="https://preslav.me/2020/03/01/use-the-git-history/"><div><p>Use the Git History to Identify Pain Points in Any Project</p><p>Have you heard of Adam Tornhill [https://twitter.com/AdamTornhill]’s work?

                            <div>
        <article>
            <p>
                Built in <time datetime="2020-12-04 12:32:00">2020</time>.
            </p>
                        <p>On longer motorcycle trips, I&nbsp;often struggle to keep all my devices charged. When I&nbsp;camp for a few days, I can't find a wall socket. When I&nbsp;sleep in hostels, I&nbsp;don't want to leave my things unattended. Even when I sleep in hotels, I'm too exhausted to think about it.</p>
<p>It might seem like a trifle, but when you travel by motorcycle, you only get a few hours a day to feed yourself, clean yourslef, plan the route ahead, keep the bike running, and charge your gear. The small annoyances add up.<br></p>
<p>Instead, I wanted to charge my devices on the motorbike, inside my panniers, and preserve my energy for other things.</p>
<figure><img src="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/_fullWidth2x/The-general-plan.png" alt=""><figcaption>The general idea</figcaption></figure>
                        <h2>Thinking inside the box</h2>
<p>Bringing power <em>inside</em> the pannier was no walk in the park. I needed a connector that could be exposed to mud, dust and torrential downpours, and still work safely. It had to be easy to connect and disconnect, because I&nbsp;take the  panniers off every night.<br></p>
<p>I wasted a whole  day on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.digikey.com/">Digikey</a>,  looking for the perfect connector. As 
the bill of material ran close to 100€, 
I remembered about <a href="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/sae-connector.jpg">SAE connectors</a>. They're tough, they're
waterproof, and they're an automotive industry standard. Oh, and they're also dirt cheap. I found an <a href="https://amzn.to/2L0EoEQ">SAE panel mount connector</a> on Amazon, and lots of cheap cables and connectors to bring the system together.<br></p>
<figure><img src="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/_fullWidth2x/pass-through-diagram.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>I placed the connector on the rear of the pannier. This way, I
 can check if the luggage is secured, locked and connected in one 
glance. If I placed it in the front, I'd bump into it when moving on the bike
 and destroy it. The front side also tends to get caked in 
bugs and mud. If I placed it on the inner side, I'd likely forget it's there and tear it off on the first day.<br></p>
<p>I used a <a href="https://amzn.to/2JEYd4d">step drill bit</a> to make holes for the connector, and bolted it in place with a layer of automotive silicon in the middle. That's the same silicon they use to install windscreens, so it ought to keep the water out. I used waterproof washers on the other side, just in case. As I&nbsp;tightened the bolts, the extra silicon oozed out, and I&nbsp;wiped it off with a rag.&nbsp;I put the connector under running water for 15 minutes, and it didn't leak.</p>
<p>I wanted to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_metric_screw_thread">M5 bolts</a> for the connector, because I already pack the right tools, but the holes were too small. I used smaller M3 bolts and added a 5.5mm socket to my packing list.<br></p>

                            
                <p>All in all, it turned out exactly as I hoped. The connector is tough and waterproof, and it looks halfway decent.<br></p>
                            
                <p>Inside the panniers, I fit two 12V cigarette lighter plugs in a plastic enclosure. The enclosure can quickly be opened for inspection during border crossings.</p>
<p>I used the 4 bolts that stick out of the SAE connector to secure the enclosure to the pannier.&nbsp;Instead of soldering the wires in place, I used removable <a href="https://amzn.to/3gcMvcR">Wago connectors</a>. This should make field repairs much easier. I only need a Phillips screwdriver and a 5.5mm socket. I could also transfer the enclosure to a different set of panniers later.</p>
                            
                <p>This project coincided with my switch to USB-C. I charge all my devices with the same cables, wall sockets and car adapters. It saves a lot of space and weight.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;put a USB-C PD adapter in each cigarette lighter plug. One charges two devices at once, and the other delivers up to 72 Watts, enough to charge my Macbook.</p>
<p>If USB-C falls out of fashion, I can replace those adapters with something else.</p>
                        <h2>From the battery to the panniers<br></h2>
<p>This is roughly how I wired everything together between the battery and the panniers.&nbsp;I designed the circuit to be modular, flexible and field-repairable. I used <a href="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/sae-connector.jpg">SAE connectors</a> to connect the components together. Nothing is glued or soldered in <br>place. If something needs maintenance, I can just disconnect it and pull it out. My mini compressor and my battery tender also use SAE&nbsp; connectors, so I can just plug them in.</p>
<figure><img src="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/_fullWidth2x/wiring-diagram.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>My Macbook draws up to 87 Watts (4.3A @ 20.2V), my phone up to 15 
Watts (1.67A @ 15V), and everything else up to 10 Watts (2A @ 5V). In 
any case, the power draw is capped by my USB-C car adapters. One 
delivers up to 72 Watts, and the other up to 36 Watts. In other 
words, we top off at 108 Watts.</p>
<p>My heated grips also draw up to 39 Watts<sup><a href="https://www.webbikeworld.com/koso-apollo-heated-grips-review/">1</a></sup>. That  brings us to roughly 150 Watts.</p>
<p>I also have a <a href="https://amzn.to/2VEKhcQ">mini air compressor</a> that draws up to 72 Watts. If we wanted to charge <em>everything</em>, keep our hands warm <em>and</em> reinflate a tire at the same time, we'd draw roughly 220 Watts. Realistically, that never happens, so let's stick to <strong>150 Watts</strong>. At 12 volts, that's 12.5 Amps. 16 gauge wire should be enough<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_wire_gauge#Tables_of_AWG_wire_sizes">1</a>, <a href="https://www.powerstream.com/Wire_Size.htm">2</a></sup>.<br></p>
                            
                <p>That black enclosure in the middle is the  relay box. It connects the other components to the ignition switch. When the ignition is off, the entire circuit is off. If I leave something plugged in overnight, I&nbsp;won't wake up to a dead battery. That's a risk I can't afford to take when I'm driving through deserts, several thousand kilometres from home.<br></p>
<p>Inside the relay box, I use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw_terminal">screw terminals</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/3gcMvcR">Wago connectors</a>, no soldering. I&nbsp;can modify the circuit using <a href="https://nicolasbouliane.com/blog/motorcycle-packing-list">the tools I usually carry</a>. Again, this greatly simplifies field repairs. The relay circuit itself is Bigpie's Fuse Box. It's great, except that it uses full-sized ATC fuses, while the motorbike uses mini ATC fuses. I need to carry two kinds of spare fuses. Fortunately, they're not very heavy.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;also had some issues with the screw terminals. They're a tad flimsy. When I opened the relay box to take photos, one of the connections came undone.</p>
                            
                <p>The relay box is right under the seat. I&nbsp;was a bit worried about water getting in there. After spending a few hours researching expensive waterproof grommets, I called my father, who reminded me about  hot glue.<br></p>
                            
                <h2>Finishing touches</h2>
<p>Once the circuit was tested and working, I held everything in place with cable ties. I&nbsp;added green tape on everything I&nbsp;added, to make it easier to identify what came with the bike, and what didn't.</p><h2>Final result</h2>
<p>It's winter, and we're in the middle of a global pandemic, so my powered luggage didn't see much action. However, I tested it with all of my devices, and it works great. I'm looking forward to a proper field test.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>When COVID hit the first time, we lost 80% of our little independent coworking space revenue within a month 😱.</p><p>The math were pretty simple: 30% of our revenue come from the venue booking for events, 40% from sponsorship, 10% from our own events &amp; 20% from actual coworking membership. With no event, we don't only loose the revenue from this channel but also the value creation we are selling to sponsors: traffic and exposure. So all others channels are getting impacted 💥.</p><p>After a month of tears and cry, I realised that this was not a threat: it was actually a surge to upgrade our model. The way events are done and value creation perceived will never be the same again. And we better embrace it now!<br>So we turned one of our meeting room into a fully equipped studio and started promoting hybrid events to companies.</p><p>At the beginning, very few got the point: "Why would I need you when I can simply do a Facebook live on my own". Then they eventually realised that there is 99 ways to do a shitty online event 💩. And finally, when they saw the quality and engagement of our own hybrid event, it was WAY easier to sign some deals.</p><p>Quickly, hybrid events became a major part of our revenue. What so interesting is that it became an asset to leverage the existing sponsorship deals we signed pre covid. In deed we will never get the level attention we have today. Meanwhile, most companies social media are cruelly missing high quality content. Thanks to that sponsorship, they were able to deliver value added &amp; relevant content to their audience without having to create it.</p><p>Smaller content creators and individuals were also interested by the value creation: a plug and play space where they could create live content in the best possible condition without having to manage the technical parts.</p><p>Today, our revenue is mainly driven by content creation needs. Podcast, videocast, live events, interview, it really looks like more and more people understood that quality has a cost but also a return on investment and they are willing to pay for it.</p><p>Based on our successful execution, we got the attention of bigger companies and had the honor to co-create <a href="https://www.antistud.io/" target="_blank">https://www.antistud.io</a>, a series a coworking coffee in France turned into production ready spaces.</p><p>To put some context, our coworking space (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/lespot.coworking.guadeloupe" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/lespot.coworking.guadeloupe</a>) is based in Guadeloupe, a tiny island in the Caribbean. So you can imagine how proud we are to start from there something that is creating value for a way bigger company.</p><p>➡ The take away for you: Where ever you are, what ever is the size of what you're doing, keep in mind that in the internet world, it can be seen by anyone and inspire. So make sure you turn your valuable work into an asset by documenting it. I know, the process is often tiring but if you are doing is creating value for others, the magic of the internet karma powered by your intention will create some magic for you !</p><p>🔗 Our coworking: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lespot.coworking.guadeloupe/" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/lespot.coworking.guadeloupe/</a><br>🔗 The coworking cafe startup Anticafé: <a href="https://anticafe.eu/" target="_blank">https://anticafe.eu</a><br>🔗 Our co-creation with Anticafé: <a href="https://www.antistud.io/" target="_blank">https://www.antistud.io/</a></p><p>‍</p></div></div><div id="signup"><p>💌 &nbsp;No pressure...</p><div><h2>Come, be a little crazy too</h2><p>Subscribe to our newsletter.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>It was only when I recently heard someone else say, “git stash is scary” that I realized it was top of my list of fears too. It just usually feels like there’s a chance I’ll just lose all of my in progress work to the depths of stashes and never be able to get the right incantation of <code>git</code> commands to reincarnate my code.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-git-stash-do">What does git stash do?</h3>

<p>Let me backtrack a minute! I haven’t yet explained what <code>git stash</code> even does. On the most basic level, <code>git stash</code> is one way to store in progress work in <code>git</code> for subsequent access, leaving behind a clean working directory.</p>

<p><em>Meta-note</em>: this post will be easiest to follow along if you open up a terminal and play around with <code>git stash</code> as you’re reading! The lack of syntax highlighting makes it a little tricky to see git additions / deletions. You can play around with any git repo you have, or clone <a href="https://github.com/githubtraining/hellogitworld">this hello world one</a> locally to work in a complete sandbox!</p>

<h3 id="stacks">Stacks</h3>

<p>Stashes are more easily understood as a basic last in, first out stack.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>git stash push</code> (equivalent to <code>git stash</code> when used with no arguments) will push any local changes onto the stash and leave a clean working directory.</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to <span>date </span>with <span>'origin/main'</span><span>.</span>

Changes not staged <span>for </span>commit:
  <span>(</span>use <span>"git add &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to update what will be committed<span>)</span>
  <span>(</span>use <span>"git restore &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to discard changes <span>in </span>working directory<span>)</span>
	modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit <span>(</span>use <span>"git add"</span> and/or <span>"git commit -a"</span><span>)</span>

<span>$ </span>git stash push
Saved working directory and index state WIP on main: 6ab43aa Initial commit

<span>$ </span>git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to <span>date </span>with <span>'origin/main'</span><span>.</span>

nothing to commit, working tree clean

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are a plethora of arguments we can pass to <code>git stash push</code>. The ones I find most helpful are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>-m &lt;message&gt;</code> saves the stash with a message, can be helpful for our future selves</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash push <span>-m</span> <span>"description"</span>
Saved working directory and index state On main: description
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>-p</code> patches changes (used like <code>git add -p</code>), allowing us to select which hunks to add to the stash. <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/manual/html_node/Detailed-Unified.html">Hunks</a> are areas where two files differ. Git will partition files into hunks for us!</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash push <span>-p</span>
....
Details about the hunk
....
<span>(</span>1/1<span>)</span> Stash this hunk <span>[</span>y,n,q,a,d,e,?]?
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>-u</code> includes untracked files in the stash. Without this flag, a file that <code>git</code> had never seen before would not be included in a stash</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>touch </span>new-file
<span>$ </span>git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to <span>date </span>with <span>'origin/main'</span><span>.</span>

Untracked files:
  <span>(</span>use <span>"git add &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to include <span>in </span>what will be committed<span>)</span>
	new-file

nothing added to commit but untracked files present <span>(</span>use <span>"git add"</span> to track<span>)</span>

<span>$ </span>git stash push <span>-u</span>
Saved working directory and index state WIP on main: 6ab43aa Initial commit
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>-k</code> keeps the files (or hunks) which were staged. Without this option, when we apply a stash, nothing will be staged. More on applying in the next section!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="accessing-the-stash">Accessing the stash</h3>

<p>Okay, we can now push changes onto the stash. But…. they’re still the stash abyss if we have no way of accessing them.</p>

<p><code>git stash list</code> shows us what is on the stash:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash list
stash@<span>{</span>0<span>}</span>: On main: Clear description of these changes
stash@<span>{</span>1<span>}</span>: WIP on main: 6ab43aa Initial commit
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is where the <code>-m</code> message flag from earlier will be incredibly helpful. The first item in my stash had a message (<code>Clear description of these changes</code>), the second did not.</p>

<p>Okay, okay. We can now <em>see</em> what’s on the stash. But how do we access anything on the stash? Or remove it from the stash?</p>

<p><code>git stash show</code> will show us the difference between the top item on the stash, and our current working directory:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash show
 README.md | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion<span>(</span>+<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we want to reference a different set of changes on the stash, and not the most recent one, we can use the stash index of those changes. As we can see above, each item on the stash has an index, and can be referred to by <code>stash@{index}</code></p>

<p>So, to see the set of changes in the next item on our stack, we can run:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash show stash@<span>{</span>1<span>}</span>
 README.md | 2 +-
 1 file changed, 1 insertion<span>(</span>+<span>)</span>, 1 deletion<span>(</span>-<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Neat, so we now know how to get the differences and look at what’s in the stash. But to actually access what’s on the stash, we’ll need <code>git stash apply [&lt;stash&gt;]</code>. It similarly can take an argument with the stash index to reference something later in the stash. If no argument is provided, it will default to the most recent set of changes we put in the stash (the ones at <code>stash@{0}</code>)</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash apply stash@<span>{</span>1<span>}</span>
On branch main
Your branch is up to <span>date </span>with <span>'origin/main'</span><span>.</span>

Changes not staged <span>for </span>commit:
  <span>(</span>use <span>"git add &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to update what will be committed<span>)</span>
  <span>(</span>use <span>"git restore &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to discard changes <span>in </span>working directory<span>)</span>
	modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit <span>(</span>use <span>"git add"</span> and/or <span>"git commit -a"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="removing-from-the-stash">Removing from the stash</h4>

<p>However, <code>git stash apply</code> will not <em>remove</em> the changes from the stash. If we look at the stash now, we’ll see it’s the same as it was:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash list
stash@<span>{</span>0<span>}</span>: On main: Clear description of these changes
stash@<span>{</span>1<span>}</span>: WIP on main: 6ab43aa Initial commit
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In order to remove a set of changes from the stash, we can use <code>git stash drop [&lt;stash&gt;]</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash drop stash@<span>{</span>0<span>}</span>
Dropped refs/stash@<span>{</span>0<span>}</span> <span>(</span>b09812812eb27de2cb49bfd02aba43889362b6de<span>)</span>

<span>$ </span>git stash list
stash@<span>{</span>0<span>}</span>: WIP on main: 6ab43aa Initial commit
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see that the set of changes at <code>stash@{0}</code> are now no longer on the stash, and the set of changes which were at <code>stash@{1}</code> are now at <code>stash@{0}</code>.</p>

<p>If we want to <code>apply</code> and <code>drop</code> a set of changes, we can conveniently use <code>git stash pop [&lt;stash&gt;]</code>. <code>pop</code> will only also <code>drop</code> if there’s no merge conflict.</p>

<p>To clear the stash completely, we can run <code>git stash clear</code>. This is the <em>actual</em> scary command which will cause us to lose any work in progress that you had stashed. Only run <code>git stash clear</code> if you never again want to access what is currently on the stash.</p>

<h3 id="why-stash">Why stash?</h3>

<p>So we’ve learned how to use <code>git stash</code>, but still haven’t covered <em>why</em> to use it. Stashing is intended to be a quick and easy way to get to a clean working state while not losing in progress work. And it is! Both quick, and now hopefully easy!</p>

<p>One example of when I might use <code>git stash</code> is if I’m in progress on some changes, but realize I want to amend a prior commit. I can stash the changes, amend the commit, and then apply the stash to get back to where I was.</p>

<p>Another is if I am trying to experiment with a few different ways to solve a problem, and want small, quick examples down each solution path. I might create stashes with all of my examples, and then pick the best and pursue that set of changes in a branch structure.</p>

<p>Additionally, stashing is especially helpful because it is branch agnostic. That is to say, if we switch branches, our stash will remain the same. This means stashing can also be a convenient way to carry changes through different branches.</p>

<h3 id="when-not-to-stash">When not to stash</h3>

<p>Equally import to why stash is when <em>not</em> to use it.</p>

<p>Stashing was built for convenience, and is not intended to be a permanent way to save work; that’s what branches and commits are for. Stashing also only works locally, you can’t push stashes to a repo or have others pull them down.</p>

<h3 id="branches-from-stash">Branches from stash</h3>

<p>Speaking of branches, another fun feature of stashes is that we can create a branch directly from a stash. This is done using <code>git stash branch &lt;branch_name&gt; [&lt;stash&gt;]</code> This will also drop the changes from the stash, equivalent to a <code>git stash pop</code> not a <code>git stash apply</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash branch new-branch

<h3 id="in-summary">In summary</h3>

<ul>
  <li><code>git stash</code> operates on a LIFO stack of sets of changes</li>
  <li><code>git stash list</code> shows what’s on the stash</li>
  <li><code>git stash push</code> pushes to the stash</li>
  <li><code>git stash apply</code> access changes on the stash</li>
  <li><code>git stash drop</code> removes changes from the stash</li>
  <li><code>git stash pop</code> does an <code>apply</code> and a <code>drop</code></li>
  <li>These default to the most recent item on the stash, to reference another one use <code>stash@{index}</code> where you can determine the index from <code>git stash list</code></li>
  <li>Some of these have flags which make them more convenient, including: <code>-m</code> message, <code>-p</code> patch, <code>-u</code> include untracked files, <code>-k</code> keep staged changes staged</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully you, too, can now add <code>git stash</code> to the list of fears you’ve conquered!</p>

<p>For further reading on stashing, take a look at the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash">git stash docs</a>. For further reading on <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/topics/fear-quotes">conquering fears</a>, here is a favorite quote of mine, “Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today is the day, Fable 3 Nagareyama is officially released! Does this mean the latest version is bug-free? Probably not, but at least the install command is shorter. We have also tested the release candidates in many projects and managed to fix all the outstanding issues so if you find a problem when upgrading your Fable 2 project you may even consider yourself lucky (also, please report).</p>
<p>First things first, I have to acknowledge all the people that have contributed to this release: from Don Syme himself to ncave, our mysterious contributor, and all the early-users that have helped polish this release. Very importantly, the teachers too that take care of my children in difficult times so I can focus on programming. The fact that so many people can collaborate together to put a project like Fable forward still feels like magic to me and I can only say a big THANK YOU to you all. I'm also very happy this is coincidental with the release of F# 5, as incredibly smart people are putting a lot of effort to make the development experience with the language really pleasant. Quoting Krzysztof Cieślak, what a great time to be an F# developer!</p>
<p>How can you try Fable 3, you say? This is it:</p>
<pre><code>dotnet tool install fable
dotnet fable src</code></pre><p>(Change "src" with the path to your project.) It's that easy, type <code>dotnet fable --help</code> to see more options. Of course you still need extra tooling to bundle the JS code, spin off a development server, etc. If you're upgrading an app using Webpack, please <a href="https://github.com/MangelMaxime/fulma-demo/pull/43">check this PR for reference</a>.</p>
<p>Let's quickly go through the highlights of Nagareyama:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's Fable v3. Three is bigger than two, that's already a win.</li>
<li>There are no breaking changes, your Fable 2 project should compile as is with Nagareyama (you may need to update some libraries).</li>
<li>It's a dotnet tool, following suit with most F# project. Remember when Fable, Paket and Fake had each their own way to be downloaded and version-managed? Those days are happily gone!</li>
<li>It removes the inter-process communication with JS, greatly simplifying Fable usage and development.</li>
<li>The previous point together with other fixes have improved the compilation speed by a big deal. Expect it to be at least cut in half in most cases!</li>
<li>Fable is not tightly coupled with a specific bundler anymore like Webpack so you can use any tool you like! (Webpack is still a great choice.)</li>
<li>A lot of effort has been also put to prettify the generated code, making it more readable and easier to debug if needed.</li>
<li>Nagareyama can accept plugins by library authors. Zaid is already using this feature to make it much simpler to <a href="https://youtu.be/a6Ct3CM_lj4?t=860">write React components compatible with JS tooling</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can check the <a href="https://fable.io/blog/Announcing-Nagareyama-3.html">previous posts</a> for more details.</p>


<p>So what are you waiting for? Give Nagareyama a try and let the world know if it goes well... and let us know (privately) if it doesn't 😅 Have fun!</p>

        <div id="markdown" itemprop="articleBody">
          

<p><strong>Version 4.0 of TerminusDB - the Star’s End Release</strong> * - is a big step forward in solidifying and extending the functionality of TerminusDB and TerminusHub.</p>

<p><a href="https://terminusdb.com/">TerminusDB</a> is an <a href="https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb">open source</a>, revision control graph database designed for distributed collaboration. TerminusDB allows you to push, pull, time-travel and merge data, much in the way that is possible with code in Git.</p>

<p>With this release TerminusDB takes a significant step towards our vision of a general-purpose tool for data &amp; content management and collaboration.</p>

<p>TerminusDB 4.0 extends the revision control features to allow greater visibility and reproducability by allowing you to look inside individual commits to see what changes were made. Provenance, lineage, and compliance are increasingly essential in the management of data and content.</p>

<p>The <em>major</em> additional features are:</p>

<h3 id="model-building-tool">Model Building Tool</h3>

<p>The database ships with an integrated visual schema building tool. It allows users to build complex data models using point and click tooling. This makes building models significantly quicker, more efficient, and inclusive of a broader range of people by lowering the technical bar for the application of business rules to your data.</p>

<p>It lets you visually design knowledge graphs in the same way they are presented to business users. We have tried to make the tool easy to use, while preserving the ability to model the most complex domains.</p>

<p>Like everything in TerminusDB, the models are versioned so you can make changes in testing and if it breaks your database, you can easily roll back to an earlier working version. This <strong>collaborative knowledge graph design and implementation functionality</strong> does not exist elsewhere.</p>

<p>You can currently share your models/schemas through TerminusHub - the next step is to make modelling and collaboration even easier by providing data-libraries on TerminusHub, including schema.org but also basic standard models for common domains such as CRM, accounting, and inventory. Users can then generate and share models with collaborators or the broader public.</p>

<h3 id="document-editor">Document Editor</h3>

<p>TerminusDB 4.0 has full surfability, clickability and editability of database documents through the console. It is a wiki or catalogue of all your data that you can edit in place. You don’t have to write code or execute a query, just edit the document directly. If you have a collaborative project, this is a useful approach to building and curating data assets.</p>

<p>The documents link to associated documents delivering a linked data application. You can filter documents, you can find the document you want using search, you can create a new document in the interface - it is a <strong>general-purpose tool for managing your data</strong>.</p>

<p>This is the beginning of the TerminusDB content management system, which we will be expanding over the coming months - next step is to provide web accessibility to TerminusHub databases and then a publisher API to provide the ability to publish the results of any query as a static content set.</p>

<h3 id="csv-manager">CSV Manager</h3>

<p>With a single click, you can now build a database from a CSV or a group of CSVs. You can easily use TerminusDB and TerminusHub as a place to version and collaborate when working with CSV data. This will be especially useful with fast changing data as frequently used in machine learning and data science projects.</p>

<p>We have tried to make it as simple as possible for users to interact with the CSV tooling. You can view and edit CSVs directly in the document viewer. You can also add CSVs from this interface. No need to write code.</p>

<p>The database automatically spots if the CSV is already in the database and will just add the delta. There is an append mode that just adds the data that is not there and an update mode that updates the entire CSV.</p>

<p><strong>Manage your CSVs and other data via TerminusDB and Hub.</strong></p>

<h3 id="command-line-interface">Command Line Interface</h3>

<p>We are excited to launch the TerminusDB CLI. You can connect to TerminusDB with a Git-like CLI to run queries or use the revision control features.</p>

<p>You can create databases and branches, you can list databases/branches, you can query in the command line and you can load CSVs. You also get full error reporting in the CLI. Use the CLI to import a CSV, commit changes and push the changes to TerminusHub.</p>

<p>The CLI will continue to develop and add new operations. We will make it easier to execute queries directly from the CLI. We’re also planning to launch CLIs for the JavaScript and Python clients.</p>

<p>TerminusDB is a big step towards our ambition to be a complete decentralized data and content management system that is accessible to all.</p>

<p><strong>END</strong></p>

<p>* Star’s End is a reference to the mysterious location of the Second Foundation in the Asimov series of novels. The home of the First Foundation was Terminus.</p>

                    Let's look at a type-directed approach for implementing
                    image processing applications on FPGAs. This approach will
                    enable us to statically verify a design's throughput. If you
                    like this post, check out my PLDI 2020 paper <a href="https://aetherling.org/">Aetherling</a>, which
                    provides a formal definition of the types and uses them
                    to make trade-offs automatically during the FPGA design process.

                    <p>
                        Hardware designs on FPGAs offer a different set of
                        performance trade-offs compared to software running on a
                        CPU. Greater parallelism can be achieved on an FPGA by
                        allocating more resources, like adders and multipliers.
                        This is unlike a CPU with a fixed number of cores and
                        vector lanes per cores. However, FPGA have limited
                        resources, so trade-offs must be made between
                        parallelism (or throughput) and resource utilization. In
                        this blog post, we're going to look at the
                        throughput-resource utilization trade-offs for FPGA
                        implementations of image processing operations like
                        image blurring. There are many ways to blur images on an
                        FPGA. Some designs have higher throughput, and others
                        require fewer resources. I'm going to demonstrate a type
                        system for expressing designs with different
                        throughput-resource tradeoffs that enables you to
                        statically determine a design's throughput.

                            (See below for a refresher on the types of resources

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Before we get to the type system, let's look at a few
                        different ways to blur an image on an FPGA. These
                        designs will have different throughout-resources
                        trade-offs. The below video shows one design that
                        processes one pixel per clock cycle. It does so by
                        streaming over the input pixels, accepting one at a
                        time, storing two prior input pixels in registers, and
                        computing the average of the current input and the prior
                        two.
                    </p>

                    

                    <p>
                        Design a in the image below shows the same one pixel per
                        clock design as the above animation. Designs b and c
                        show two other implementations with different
                        throughput-resource utilization trade-offs. Design b
                        processes two elements per clock, doubling the
                        throughput relative to design a and the animation above.
                        Design b requires double the adders and dividers
                        compared to design a in order to achieve this
                        throughput. Design c saves on adders but can only
                        process one pixel every third clock cycle.

                                    every third clock.  For simplicity, these
                                    designs only do a blur on a 1D image.

                        You could write up all these different designs in
                        Verilog. Assuming you wrote correct code, they would
                        synthesize to a bitstream, run on an FPGA, and provide
                        the expected throughput. But, it would be challenging to
                        statically verify that the designs achieved the correct
                        performance.

                        </a>
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Now that we've seen some different designs, we're ready
                        for the types that encode their throughputs. Since we're
                        building application-specific hardware, we can encode
                        the throughput of the designs down to the clock cycle
                        without complex performance issues common in software
                        like multi-threading. I'm going to introduce these types
                        using a simpler example than blur: <code>map
                        add10</code>. This code adds 10 to each element in an
                        input sequence. When implementing a map on an FPGA,
                        there are two basic implementations. The first
                        implementation, <code>map_s add10</code> (or
                        <code>map</code> in space), is fully parallel and
                        duplicates <code>add10</code>. If the <code>map_s</code>
                        is applied to a sequence of four elements, then four
                        elements arrive on one clock cycle, <code>map_s</code>
                        adds 10 to every element, and the four elements depart
                        on the same clock cycle. The second implementation,
                        <code>map_t add10</code> (or <code>map</code> in time),
                        is fully sequential and requires only one copy of the
                        <code>add10</code> circuit. The four input elements
                        arrive on four separate clocks and <code>map_t</code>
                        adds 10 to one element at a time.

                        The types of <code>map_s</code> and <code>map_t</code>
                        encode their throughputs. <code>map_s add10 :: SSeq 4
                        int -&gt; SSeq 4 int</code> is a function on two space
                        sequences. Each space sequence (<code>SSeq 4 int</code>)
                        encodes both the length of the sequence and that all the
                        elements occur on the same clock cycle. The type
                        signature of <code>map_s add10</code> encodes it's a
                        function which accepts four <code>int</code>s on one
                        clock and emits them on one clock. This is a throughput
                        of four <code>int</code>s per clock. <code>map_t add10 :: TSeq 4 0
                        int -&gt; TSeq 4 0 int</code> is a function on two time
                        sequences. Each time sequence (<code>TSeq 4 0 int</code>)
                        encodes that all the elements elements occur on different clocks, one after another. The type
                        signature of <code>map_t add10</code> encodes it's a
                        function which accepts four <code>int</code>s on separate
                        clocks and emits them on separate clocks. This is a throughput
                        of one <code>int</code> per clock. The fully sequential
                        throughput, like the fully parallel one for <code>map_s
                        add10</code>, is easily expressed using the space-time
                        types.

                        design b is partially parallel: it processes more than
                        one pixel per clock but doesn't do the entire image at

        <section>
            <div><p>The <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero/?resellerType=home">Raspberry Pi Zero</a> and original Raspberry Pi both have a 32-bit ARM architecture which many projects have dropped support for. So when I saw that <a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/4530">containerd recently merged a fix</a> for building containerd on armv6, started to think what I could do with it.</p>
<p>Earlier that month, a user of the <a href="http://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd project</a> which runs very well on VPSes, RPi 3 and RPi4 asked me whether it could work on the Zero and I told him it was not practical or worth his time. After all, an RPi4 with 2GB of RAM, 4 Cores and much faster I/O is only 25GBP/EUR/USD.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd is OpenFaaS</a>, but for a single node, and designed for those who don't want to pay for and manage an entire Kubernetes cluster, GitOps, service-mesh, and IngressController just to deploy a few simple functions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My past experiences told me that it would be a challenge to get the zero working. It has such a paltry amount of memory available and its I/O is really slow. Still, sometimes it's fun to do things that we shouldn't. Had I been <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">"nerd sniped"</a>?</p>
<p><img src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/homepage-9df4b/static/1dfa03d09c1f3e446e8d936dfb92267f/8924f/6b0defdbbf40792b64159ab8169d97162c380b2c_raspberry-pi-zero-1-1755x1080.jpg" width="60%">
&gt; The RPi Zero originally released in 2015.
</p><p>In this post I'll show you what you need to do to deploy functions through the <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli">OpenFaaS CLI</a> and be able to invoke them, including multi-arch builds. At the end of the post I'll explain what the limitations are and whether we should leave the Raspberry Pi Zero with those fond memories we have of it when it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi">released in 2015</a>, 5 years ago.</p>
<h2 id="walkthrough">Walk-through</h2>
<h3 id="prereqs">Pre-reqs</h3>
<p>You will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi Zero</li>
<li>Ethernet adapter and USB &lt;&gt; USB A micro shim</li>
<li>16-32GB class 10 SD card</li>
<li>MicroUSB power adapter</li>
</ul>
<p>Flash the latest version of Raspberry Pi OS Lite to your SD card, and then create an <code>ssh</code> file in the <code>/boot/</code> folder.</p>
<p>Power up the Raspberry Pi and ssh to it with <code>ssh pi@raspberrypi.local</code>.</p>
<h3 id="installgo">Install go</h3>
<p>You can install Go from a package manager, but the version is likely to be rather old. Fortunately the Go team still ship a binary for armv6:</p>
<pre><code>export ARCH="armv6l"
echo "Downloading Go"

curl -SLsf https://dl.google.com/go/go1.13.15.linux-$ARCH.tar.gz --output /tmp/go.tgz
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go/
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/go/
sudo tar -xvf /tmp/go.tgz -C /usr/local/go/ --strip-components=1

export GOPATH=$HOME/go/
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin/
</code></pre>
<p>You now have Go installed, run <code>go version</code> to see it working.</p>
<h3 id="buildcontainerd">Build containerd</h3>
<p>faasd uses containerd rather than Docker, but there are no official binaries for any of the ARM CPUs, so we have to build them from source.</p>
<p>For armv7 and ARM64, you can use my repo <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/containerd-arm">alexellis/containerd-arm</a>. It's my hope to see ARM support upstreamed, but having spoken on several occasions to the containerd team, it seems very unlikely that we will see this happen.</p>
<p>On my first attempt of building I got the following error:</p>
<pre><code>+ bin/containerd
# github.com/containerd/containerd/cmd/containerd
/usr/local/go/pkg/tool/linux_arm/link: running gcc failed: fork/exec /usr/bin/gcc: cannot allocate memory
make: *** [Makefile:188: bin/containerd] Error 2
</code></pre>
<p>The RPi Zero and the largest RPi 1 only has 512MB of RAM and I slowly watched the RAM being eaten up with <code>watch -n "free -h"</code>.. I should have remembered this.</p>
<p>Fortunately I had the battle scars and knew what I had to do:</p>
<pre><code>sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1024 count=1M &amp;&amp;\
  sudo mkswap /swapfile &amp;&amp; \
  sudo swapon /swapfile
</code></pre>
<p>This creates 1GB of swap, on the SD card.. which already has terrible I/O, but it may just work.</p>
<p>The other trick you may have seen me talk about is adding <code>gpu_mem=16</code> to <code>/boot/config.txt</code>. It seems pointless changing the split on an 8GB RPi4, but for our RPi Zero, we need every MB we can get.</p>
<p>Second time lucky?</p>
<p>No. It failed again due to some missing libraries. I reminded myself to read <a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/master/BUILDING.md#build-containerd">BUILDING.md</a> from the containerd repo. After adding libseccomp and a few other packages, it started to move along again.</p>
<pre><code>make
+ bin/ctr
+ bin/containerd
+ bin/containerd-stress
+ bin/containerd-shim
+ bin/containerd-shim-runc-v1
+ bin/containerd-shim-runc-v2
+ binaries
</code></pre>
<p>I don't know if it was 10 minutes or over an hour, but it was slow progress.</p>
<p>I then ran <code>sudo make install</code> and copied the systemd unit file into place with:</p>
<pre><code>sudo cp containerd.service /etc/systemd/system/containerd.service
sudo systemctl enable containerd
</code></pre>
<p>I didn't want to start containerd at this time, to save on memory for the next task.</p>
<h3 id="buildfaasd">Build faasd</h3>
<p>The faasd Makefile needed a patch because it was set to cross-compile to armv7, but we needed armv6.</p>
<pre><code>.PHONY: dist
dist:
	CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm GOARM=6 go build -mod=vendor -ldflags $(LDFLAGS) -a -installsuffix cgo -o bin/faasd-armhf
</code></pre>
<p>This took so long to build on the zero that I gave up and built it on my Intel NUC. Fortunately Go is very good as cross-compiling, especially when linking into C/C++ libraries is disabled with <code>CGO_ENABLED=0</code>.</p>
<p>I then ran <code>scp</code> to copy the binary to the Raspberry Pi.</p>
<pre><code>sudo cp faasd-armhf /usr/local/bin/faasd
cd go/src/github.com/openfaas/faasd
</code></pre>
<p>The final step was to install faasd which creates two systemd unit files:</p>
<ul>
<li>faasd - for the OpenFaaS core services</li>
<li>faasd-provider - for the provider that supports CRUD and Invoke operations</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>sudo faasd install
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/12/faasd-install.jpg" alt="faasd-install"></p>
<h3 id="unexpectedissues">Unexpected issues</h3>
<p>I tried to log in with <code>faas-cli login</code>, but it didn't work. I saw a number of errors in the logs <code>sudo systemctl journalctl -u faasd</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Dec 03 23:18:49 zero-dns default:basic-auth-plugin[13218]: standard_init_linux.go:207: exec user process caused "exec format error"
Dec 03 23:18:50 zero-dns containerd[12169]: time="2020-12-03T23:18:50.338589900Z" level=info msg="starting signal loop" namespace=default path=/run/containerd/io.containerd.runtime.v2.task/default/gateway pid=13324
Dec 03 23:18:52 zero-dns default:gateway[13335]: standard_init_linux.go:207: exec user process caused "exec format error"
</code></pre>
<p>It turned out that out of nats, prometheus, and the openfaas gateway, the openfaas basic-auth plugin only nats was available for armv6. It seems that projects really have moved on and left armv6 behind.</p>
<h3 id="thenihadanidea">Then I had an idea</h3>
<p>What if we didn't run the whole OpenFaaS stack at all, but just the <code>faasd-provider</code>? It would allow this tiny device to support all the CRUD operations on functions, and invocations, but nothing more.</p>
<p>The provider seemed to be running well, and responding to <code>faas-cli</code> commands:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/12/provider.png" alt="provider"></p>
<p>We'd lose the queue and async invocations, lose the UI, lose the metrics, but we could still deploy functions and invoke them.</p>
<p>It was already very late by this point so I decided to sleep on it.</p>
<h3 id="inthemorning">In the morning</h3>
<p>I powered up the RPi zero and tried deploying a container directly to the faasd endpoint, and it worked.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/12/deploy.jpg" alt="deploy"></p>
<p>Now, I had to make a few changes. Rather than building with the OpenFaaS watchdog in the container, I just used a Dockerfile and a plain Go HTTP server.</p>
<p>Here's what I ended up with:</p>
<p>Dockerfile</p>
<pre><code>FROM --platform=${BUILDPLATFORM:-linux/amd64} golang:1.13-alpine3.11 as build

	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

	s := &amp;http.Server{

		MaxHeaderBytes: 1 &lt;&lt; 20, // Max header of 1MB
	}

	http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {

<p>I ran this on my PC with the following:</p>
<pre><code>export OPENFAAS_URL=http://192.168.0.81:8081
faas-cli publish --platform linux/arm/v6

faas-cli deploy
</code></pre>
<p>Using the PC means we can cross-compile the Go HTTP server and push a multi-arch image to the container registry. The new <code>faas-cli publish</code> command comes in handy for this and can accept a list of architectures.</p>
<p>The <code>deploy</code> command talks to the remote machine over REST and tells it to deploy a function. The server-side handler <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/blob/master/pkg/provider/handlers/deploy.go">deploy.go</a> pulls the image into containerd and starts executing it as a container.</p>
<h3 id="onemorething">One more thing</h3>
<p>When I say that it worked. I should clarify that I'd forgotten to deploy CNI - the networking layer required for faasd and containerd.</p>
<p>I saw this error by running the following:</p>
<pre><code>sudo journalctl -u faasd
</code></pre>
<p>Not that long ago, <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/blob/master/docs/DEV.md">I'd documented all the steps required for a manual installation</a>, but somehow forgot this was needed.</p>
<pre><code>export ARCH=arm
export CNI_VERSION=v0.8.5

sudo mkdir -p /opt/cni/bin
curl -sSL https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases/download/${CNI_VERSION}/cni-plugins-linux-${ARCH}-${CNI_VERSION}.tgz | sudo tar -xz -C /opt/cni/bin

# Make a config folder for CNI definitions

{
    "cniVersion": "0.3.1",

</code></pre>
<p>Just changing "ARCH" to "arm" was enough to make it work. So the CNI project are still <a href="https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/blob/master/.travis.yml">building the plugins against armv6</a> for the time being.</p>

<p>Then it was a case of simply running <code>faas-cli deploy</code> again, and finally, it actually worked.</p>

				<p>We make plant-based cheese, so why would our main target market be vegetarians, who of course do eat cheese from animals?</p><p>The reason is the same why we started Yeti in the first place: We want to make animals obsolete in food production. Therefore, we need to convince people who otherwise do eat dairy-based cheese to eat Yeti instead. For every gram of plant-based cheese they eat instead of dairy-based, we come a small step closer to our mission.</p><p>Of course, that doesn't mean we're unhappy when vegans eat our products - not at all. However, it's much easier to convince people who are already on a plant-based diet to buy our cheese. In order to convince vegetarians or omnivores, our cheese needs to be as good as or better than cheese from animals. Therefore, clearly focusing efforts on non-vegans sets a high bar for our cheeses and forces us to make excellent products. This is the goal we set for ourselves.</p><p>Now, you might ask yourself why we target vegetarians specifically and not also omnivores. The reason is a practical one: We believe that it's easier to reach and convince vegetarians, because we've been vegetarians for a long time before going 100% plant-based and cheese was what was holding us back. If you talk to any vegetarian, I'd wager that a vast majority of them will tell you that cheese is the reason that they're not vegan.</p><p>Or, put differently, we know that a big problem in the vegatarian market is the absence of great plant-based cheese. A clearly defined problem makes it easier for us to reach our customers effectively and get them try our cheese.</p>

<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>Just before the 2020 general election, a friend on Twitter paraphrased a famous quote that says, “if you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything.” And later, another friend on Whatsapp said, “you have to take a side. Not taking a side, in the face of what we are seeing, is actually taking sides.” The <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-may-have-won-the-election-but-the-deep-partisan-divide-in-america-remains/"><span>narrow margin</span></a> of victory suggests such anecdotes may be shared by a large portion of the population.&nbsp;</p>
<!--more--><p>Many journalists also <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2020/11/01/americas-press-and-the-asymmetric-war-for-truth/"><span>struggle</span></a> with the issue of taking sides. Most were trained to write in an objective manner and keep their opinions out of the story. But this style has lately been accused of having the “<a href="https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2020/07/16/how-objectivity-in-journalism-became-a-matter-of-opinion"><span>view from nowhere</span></a>” (i.e., reporting information on “both sides” and possibly implying false equivalence when one side is obviously right). Perhaps it is no surprise that the <a href="https://www.rand.org/news/press/2019/05/14.html"><span>level of opinionatedness</span></a> has gone up in journalism.</p>
<p>For individuals in the general public who want to be well informed, what are the implications of increasing partisanship in our communities and rising opinionatedness in the news? Should we remain loyal to our favorite news sources or challenge our perspectives by reading information we disagree with?&nbsp;</p>
<p>At a fundamental level, can you remain unbiased when reading the news?</p>
<p><img src="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/us-political-polarization-crop.gif" alt="Political Polarization"></p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2017/10/05/the-partisan-divide-on-political-values-grows-even-wider/" rel="noopener">Pew Research</a></p>
<h3>Multiple perspectives crucial to combating partisanship</h3>
<p>While many readers want unbiased news, a basic truth is that everyone is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jan/12/psychology-of-group-reasoning-versus-individual"><span>subject to biases</span></a>. While some reporters and news sources claim these biases explicitly, others are less aware and may frame facts and arguments in a way they feel is truthful yet remains colored by their own experiences and beliefs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of pervasive bias, a rising level of opinionatedness in journalism is not necessarily cause for alarm and reinforces a core precept of reading the news: that no single article or source will present all the facts and arguments for an issue. Hence the importance of reading multiple perspectives, ideally across the political spectrum.</p>
<p>Incidentally, this practice is more common in the history of news consumption than we think. In the days of print news, many households received multiple dailies, often representing different political viewpoints.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>False equivalence concerns may be overstated</h3>
<p>When reading multiple perspectives, we must challenge ourselves to think critically. Here are some questions to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>What facts are presented and are any left out?</li>
<li>What’s the history of this issue and are there trends in the data presented?</li>
<li>What can we learn from other countries/locations that can inform our understanding?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>When provided with all of the facts and varying viewpoints, and some time to think things through, most readers are equipped to draw accurate conclusions. Veteran journalists such as <a href="https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1329599947503767552?s=20"><span>Matt Taibbi</span></a> recommend empowering readers to be independent thinkers as a best practice. It also means that worries about false equivalency may be overstated because people can judge for themselves if they believe the evidence supporting one side even if the other side was presented in as much detail.</p>
<p>As an aside, this is how we conduct jury trials — we assume that a panel of average citizens, presented with the facts arguing for and against a conviction, will reach the <a href="https://theconversation.com/all-about-juries-why-do-we-actually-need-them-and-can-they-get-it-wrong-112703"><span>right conclusion</span></a> most of the time. So why not expect the same of our society when it comes to reading the news?&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Bias is OK, empathy is better</h3>
<p>Just as all writers are biased, so too are all readers. Reading the news doesn’t require us to put aside our biases or opinions. Rather, reading the news is a way to get the facts and arguments for and against an issue so that whatever opinions you hold are grounded in the facts.</p>
<p>Finally, by reading multiple perspectives, even if your opinions and biases don’t change, you may develop empathy for people who have viewpoints different than yours. A more empathetic society is something to strive for in a world that seems increasingly divided.</p></span>

<![CDATA[Enabling Hardware Acceleration on AWS Firecracker]]>
            </title>

December 4, 2020 | https://blog.cloudkernels.net/posts/vaccel_v2/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.cloudkernels.net/posts/vaccel_v2/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      

<p>In our <a href="https://blog.cloudkernels.net/posts/vaccel/">previous post</a> we spoke about the potential solutions for
deploying serverless offerings with hardware acceleration support. With the
increasing adoption of the serverless and FaaS paradigms, providers will need
to offer some form of hardware acceleration semantics.</p>

<p>For some time now, Amazon has <a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/issues/1179">identifed</a> this as a “compelling use
case” for their AWS Firecracker hypervisor which powers the Amazon Lambda
service. What is more, they identify traditional techniques for GPU support in
VMs such as GPU passthrough comes with limitations and significantly increases
the attack surface of the hypervisor.</p>

<p>As an alternative to passing through the accelerator device inside the guest,
paravirtual interfaces can expose hardware acceleration capabilities inside
the VM with minimal overhead and offering a simple user interface for
offloading code to the host for acceleration.</p>

<p>In fact, such interfaces already exist. <code>virtio-crypto</code> is an example, where
the guest VM uses a simple crypto API while the actual computation is
offloaded, through the paravirtual driver, to the host.</p>

<p>We believe that the same paradigm can be applied to any kind of computation
that can benefit from acceleration. Whether that is crypto operations, Machine
Learning or linear algebra operators, the workflow from the point of view of
the developer these days is the same; You will use a framework such as
cryptodev, Jetson Inference or the BLAS library, to write your applications and
you will not deal with the low-level complexities of the actual accelerator.
Moreover, that workflow should not be different whether your application runs
on baremetal or inside a VM.</p>

<p>In the rest of this post we present  <em>vAccel</em>, an acceleration framework that
enables <strong>portable</strong> and <strong>hardware agnostic</strong> acceleration for cloud
and edge applications.</p>

<h2 id="vaccel-design">vAccel design</h2>

<p>In simple terms, vAccel is an accleration API. It offers support for a set of
operators that commonly use hardware acceleration to increase performance,
such as machine learning and linear algebra operators.</p>

<p>The API is implemented by <em>VaccelRT</em> a thin and efficient runtime system that links
against the user application and is responsible for dispatching operations to
the relevant hardware accelerators. The interaction with the hardware itself is
mediated by plugins which implement the API for the specific hardware
accelerator.</p>

<p>This design is driven by our requirements for high degree of portability, an
application that consumes the vAccel API can run without modification or even
re-compilation to any platform for which there is suitable back-end plugin.</p>

<p>In fact, this opens up the way to enable the vAccel API inside a VM guest. The missing
bits are a virtio driver that implements the vAccel API and a backend plugin that
speaks with the virtio device. Once you have this components in place, you can
run your existing vAccel application inside a VM, just by using the virtio-plugin at
runtime.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cloudkernels.net/static/vaccel_v2/vaccelrt.png#center" alt="vAccel runtime" title="VaccelRT"></p>

<h2 id="vaccel-support-in-aws-firecracker">vAccel support in AWS Firecracker</h2>

<p>Once we implemented the frontend vAccel-virtio driver and virtio plugin for VaccelRT,
we need a hypervisor to test this on. We already showed, in the previous post some
initial vAccel results with QEMU as the target hypervisor. In this post, we will focus
on AWS Firecracker.</p>

<p>AWS Firecracker has been designed having in mind really small boot times and small attack
surface, which makes it a compelling choice for cloud and edge deployments.
Moreover, it powers up Lambda, Amazon’s serverless platform, which we see as a
paradigm for which vAccel’s hardware abstraction level is a perfect fit.</p>

<p>AWS Firecracker already implements virtio backend drivers for net, block and vsock. That
was good news for us, we have all the required virtio machinery. All we had to do, was
add a new device for vAccel and link the hypervisor with VaccelRT.</p>

<p>The last bit required us to create the necessary Rust bindings for calling C from AWS Firecracker
which is written in Rust. This was actually a good exercise for us, since we plan to anyway
provide bindings for the vAccel API in more high-level languages.</p>

<p>With all the components in place our stack looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cloudkernels.net/static/vaccel_v2/vaccele2e.png#center" alt="vAccel VM execution" title="vaccel-e2e"></p>

<p>The user application is consumes the vAccel API and links against VaccelRT. Inside the VM
the application uses the vAccel-virtio backend plugin. When a vAccel function is called, the
plugin will offload the request to <code>/dev/accel</code> device which is the interface of the virtio
driver. Next, the virtio driver will forward the request to the vAccel-enabled AWS Firecracker
instance which will the host-residing VaccelRT. Finally, in the host side, VaccelRT will use
one of the available plugins, to execute the operation on the hardware accelerator.</p>

<p>But how does this perform?</p>

<p>We first grabbed a copy of jetson-inference, a rich repo full of ML inference models and example applications based on TensorRT. We patched it to be able to run on an x86 GPU (we had an NVIDIA RTX 2060 SUPER handy), and we built the vAccelRT backend for an image classification operation. To compare vAccel on AWS firecracker we patched the example imagenet-console application to properly calculate the time of execution and to account for more than 1 iteration. The average execution time for image classification on two sets of Image files (set “*_0.jpg” and “*_1.jpg) are shown below:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cloudkernels.net/static/vaccel_v2/vaccel_bf_0.png#center" alt="vAccel VM execution" title="vaccel-bf-0"></p>

<p>The set above is sorted by the overhead percentage (GUEST vs HOST), while the set below, is sorted by Image size (in KB). One thing to note is that on all cases, the overhead of running an image classification operation in the guest compared to the host is less than 5%.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cloudkernels.net/static/vaccel_v2/vaccel_bf_1.png#center" alt="vAccel VM execution" title="vaccel-bf-1"></p>

<h2 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</h2>

<p>So, are you brave (or curious) enough to try it out yourself ? Full disclosure, vAccel is WiP, in terms of software development terms, the project should be considered in a pre-alpha phase. However, since we think the idea is useful, there might be someone willing to try it out. So here we go:</p>

<p>TL;DR
The easy way to try vAccel on AWS Firecracker is to run the docker container bundled with all necessary libraries/tools etc. The only prerequisite is [Docker][<a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-runtime">https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-runtime</a>] &amp; nvidia-container-runtime[<a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-runtime">https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-runtime</a>] installed.</p>

<p>To fire a VM up try running:</p>

<pre><code>docker run -e LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib -e VACCEL_BACKENDS=/usr/local/lib/libvaccel-jetson.so --rm -it --gpus all --privileged nubificus/jetson-runtime
</code></pre>

<p>Now what the above command does is the following:
- sets up a couple of env vars to let the container know where to find the necessary libraries
- runs in a privileged mode so that /dev/kvm is available to the container instance (we need to boot a VM in there ;))
- provides access to the GPU from the container.</p>

<p>The entrypoint for the above container image (<code>nubificus/jetson-runtime</code>) simply starts a firecracker VM with a pre-built kernel &amp; rootfs.img, available <a href="https://github.com/nubificus/fc-x86-guest-build">here</a>. This repository contains the dockerfile from which these binaries have been produced. You can download ready-made binaries from the <a href="https://github.com/nubificus/fc-x86-guest-build/releases/latest">releases</a> page.</p>

<p>If (for any reason) you want to try out jetson-inference, without the AWS Firecracker VM boot, then just run the container with /bin/bash as an entrypoint, using the following command:</p>

<pre><code>docker run --network=host --rm -it --gpus all --privileged -v nubificus/jetson-runtime /bin/bash
</code></pre>

<h3 id="host">Host</h3>

<p>The current available version of vAccelRT supports the jetson-inference plugin. Adding a new plugin is as easy as linking with vAccelRT and writing the glue code in the plugin directory – more information should be available in the coming weeks!</p>

<p>To use this plugin, the Host machine should have an NVIDIA GPU (supporting CUDA), the relevant drivers installed, as well as <a href="https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference">jetson-inference</a> installed.</p>

<p>The next step is to build &amp; install <a href="https://github.com/cloudkernels/vaccelrt">vAccelRT</a>, the glue that ties everything together. You can build it from source, or just install the binaries available from the <a href="https://github.com/cloudkernels/vaccelrt/releases/latest">releases</a> page. Make sure you specify <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> to the folder where libvaccel.so is located, as well as to choose the necessary backend by setting <code>VACCEL_BACKENDS</code> to <code>libvaccel-jetson.so</code>.</p>

<pre><code>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
export VACCEL_BACKENDS=/usr/local/lib/libvaccel-jetson.so
</code></pre>

<h3 id="vm">VM</h3>

<p>To run a vAccel-enabled VM, we need four basic components:</p>

<ul>
<li>the AWS firecracker VMM (with the vAccel backend patch) <a href="https://github.com/cloudkernels/firecracker">github</a> <a href="https://github.com/cloudkernels/firecracker/releases/latest">releases</a></li>
<li>a firecracker guest Linux kernel supporting modules + the virtio-accel module <a href="https://github.com/nubificus/fc-x86-guest-build">github</a> <a href="https://github.com/nubificus/fc-x86-guest-build/releases/latest">releases</a></li>
<li>the vAccel runtime system (vAccelRT) for the Host and the guest <a href="https://github.com/cloudkernels/vaccelrt">github</a> <a href="https://github.com/cloudkernels/vaccelrt/releases/latest">releases</a></li>
</ul>

<p>To facilitate the process of packing all these software components, we include links to binaries built from the respective github repositories.</p>

<p>Grab, or build <code>vmlinux</code> &amp; the <code>rootfs.img</code> from the links above, and use a template config for firecracker like the following:</p>

<pre><code>{
	"boot-source": {
		"kernel_image_path": "vmlinux",
		"boot_args": "console=ttyS0 reboot=k panic=1 pci=off loglevel=0 root=/dev/vda quiet"
	},
	"drives": [
		{
			"drive_id": "rootfs",
			"path_on_host": "rootfs.img",
			"is_root_device": true,
			"is_read_only": false
		}
	],
	"network-interfaces": [
	{
		"iface_id": "eth0",
		"guest_mac": "AA:FC:00:00:00:01",
		"host_dev_name": "tap"
	}
	],
	"crypto": {
		"crypto_dev_id": "vaccel0",
		"host_crypto_dev": "/dev/vaccel0"
	},
	"machine-config": {
		"vcpu_count": 1,
		"mem_size_mib": 1024,
		"ht_enabled": false
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure vmlinux, rootfs.img are in the same directory as the invocation of the firecracker command. Also, ensure that you have set <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> and <code>VACCEL_BACKENDS</code> correctly, and that you’ve downloaded the ML networks needed for inference. This step can be done using <a href="https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/blob/master/tools/download-models.sh">this script</a>. Just get this script and run:</p>

<pre><code>./download-models.sh NO
</code></pre>

<p>and the models will be placed by default at <code>../data/networks</code>. Change the path in the script if you need to. For the AWS Firecracker backend to work, we need the models in the same directory as the invocation of the firecracker binary, in a folder called networks.</p>

<p>Now, we’re ready to fire up our VM:</p>

<pre><code>firecracker --api-sock …</code></pre></div></div>

December 4, 2020 | https://actualbudget.com/blog/porting-local-app-web | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://actualbudget.com/blog/porting-local-app-web">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>While researching <a href="https://actualbudget.com/blog/cursed-caching-curious">a curious caching bug</a>, I got inspired to take another look at how Actual stores data locally on the web. There's some history I need to explain. Years ago, Actual was only going to be a desktop app. That means <em>all</em> of your data is stored locally. No server.</p><p>Then I realized how important mobile is, and that most people don't want to worry about losing their data if they drop their computer in the ocean. A syncing engine was born, and desktop and mobile apps have happily synced their data ever since. A copy is kept on a server so users can login and easily view their data, and if they worry about privacy they can enable <a href="https://actualbudget.com/docs/overview/syncing-across-devices/#end-to-end-encryption">end-to-end encryption</a>.</p><p>In the last year I grew jealous of web apps. Look at how easily they can deploy… how quickly they can drop users right into the app. No install required. Here I am asking users to download an 80MB file just to run the app. That download absolutely kills conversion rates, and makes the login flow, support, a/b testing and <em>everything</em> much harder.</p><p>I love desktop apps because you have access to much better tech (like native sqlite3), the app is super fast (no network calls), and the user owns their data. However, I can't ignore that the benefits of the web <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2009/09/05/desktop-aps-versus-web-apps/">dwarfs these advantages</a>.</p><p>I started thinking about a web version of Actual. After some hacking, <a href="https://app.actualbudget.com/">I got it working</a> without changing the architecture. That means all your data is still stored locally in the browser, and there are no network calls. It's a completely 100% "local" app in the browser [0].</p><p>I haven't marketed the web version much because it hasn't been tested enough, and it needs improvements like lazy loading code to make it load faster. The biggest thing I'm worried about is the data storage layer. Since <strong>all your data is local</strong>, if something goes wrong there you could potentially lose data. And we're really stressing the browser's persistant db by storing everything in it.</p><p>To be clear: <strong>we are not deprecating the desktop version</strong>. However in the future the web version will be the primary platform, with the choice to download the desktop version if desired.</p><p>The way it works a bit unusual. Here's a high-level overview:</p><ul><li>Actual uses <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">sqlite3</a>. This is a hard requirement. The app runs tons of complex SQL queries to aggregate financial data and it's so good at doing it. Queries are easy to express and run super fast.</li><li>On desktop and mobile, native sqlite3 is used. The web does not support sqlite3, however. To get around this, Actual uses a <a href="https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js">wasm version</a> of sqlite3 and creates an in-memory db.</li><li>The obvious problem is persistence. When you make changes, we need to persist them somewhere so when the user reloads they don't lose their data. Luckily we are using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type#State-based_CRDTs">state-based CRDT's</a> and all updates come through as a list of "messages". If you are online, these messages get synced to our server so when you reload, all your data should sync up.</li><li>It's not ideal to require a big sync every time you open the app though. Also, if you are offline there shouldn't be any chance of losing data. To solve this, Actual persists each message into IndexedDB. When the app opens, it applies all messages from the local IndexedDB to get up-to-date.</li><li>It's <em>still</em> not ideal to require applying any messages on load. It won't scale - if you use the app for months you'll accumulate tens of thousands of messages. IndexedDB would grow indefinitely and loading the app would get slower. To solve this, when the stored messages crosses a threshold it flushes the entire sqlite3 db to IndexedDB and clears all the messages.</li><li>That means both a binary representation of the sqlite3 db and a list of messages is persisted in IndexedDB. On load, the app creates the in-memory sqlite3 db from the snapshot and applies any remaining messages from IDB.</li></ul><p>Turns out this is similar to how a <a href="https://sqlite.org/wal.html">write-ahead log</a> works.</p><p>I was worried about the reliability of IndexedDB. Reading the docs it seems like browsers might delete databases as needed, but in practice this doesn't seem to happen [1]. It's probably a much bigger problem on mobile where memory is scarce, but I don't mess with the mobile web (use a native app instead). I was also worried about hitting the limit of IDB storage, but as explained next that hasn't been a problem.</p><p>This technique started as an experiment, but it has worked surprisingly well. I have 5 years worth of data in Actual, and the size of the sqlite3 db is 9.7MB. The threshold of the messages table is around 50KB, so in total I'm storing ~10MB in IndexedDB for a user who's been around for 5 years. It's not even close to hitting the IndexedDB max storage limit, which these days is at least 500MB.</p><p>While it has worked so far, I want to be 100% confident in this approach. I've been digging deep into how each browser stores IndexedDB data on disk and discovered a couple improvements I can make. I was going to write about them in this post, but I ended up writing more about the overall approach. In the next post I'll dig deep into how IndexedDB works across browsers.</p><p>[0] While I didn't talk about it in this post, this also means that the entire app runs in the browser. The "backend" runs in a background worker thread and everything happens locally.</p><p>[1] If the local data does somehow get corrupted or deleted, it's not a <em>huge</em> deal. All changes are still sent off and stored on a server (which is how all other devices get synced). If something goes wrong, the app can re-download your data from the server. The only case where you'd lose data is if you were offline and lost your local data, which is to be expected.</p></div></div></div>]]>

December 4, 2020 | https://dotink.co/posts/histools/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://dotink.co/posts/histools/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        

        <p>Today I made <a href="https://github.com/thesephist/histools"><strong>Histools</strong></a>, a small set of tools for visualizing browser history data from Apple’s Safari browser. It renders a heatmap of pages visited on Safari over time, alongside a searchable, sorted list of pages I’ve visited most often with mini-heatmaps for each URL.</p>
<p><img src="https://dotink.co/img/histools.png" alt="Histools screenshot"></p>
<p>Histools is built on my homebrew tech stack: Ink for the analysis script and server and the Torus UI library for the interactive visualizations. If you want to run Histools over your own Safari history file, you can find the how-to’s in the GitHub readme linked here. In the rest of this post, I want to explore how Safari stores its history entries on disk.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/thesephist/histools">See Histools on GitHub →</a></p>
<h2 id="inspecting-safaris-history-database">Inspecting Safari’s history database</h2>
<p>Histools works by transforming history data from the database into a format that can be usefully visualized on a heatmap. In macOS Catalina, Safari keeps history in a simple SQLite3 database, at <code>~/Library/Safari/History.db</code>. So the first step for me was to copy this database file out to a safe location, and open the sqlite shell to look at the database schema.</p>
<pre><code>sqlite History.db ".schema"
</code></pre><p>This returns us all of the table definitions, which you can also check out <a href="https://github.com/thesephist/histools/blob/main/meta/History.schema.sql">here</a>. For the sake of looking at history, we’re only really concerned with two tables: <code>history_items</code> and <code>history_visits</code>. Here’s what those tables looks like.</p>
<pre><code>CREATE TABLE history_items
(
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY autoincrement,
    url text NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    domain_expansion text NULL,
    visit_count INTEGER NOT NULL,
    daily_visit_counts BLOB NOT NULL,
    weekly_visit_counts BLOB NULL,
    autocomplete_triggers BLOB NULL,
    should_recompute_derived_visit_counts INTEGER NOT NULL,
    visit_count_score                     INTEGER NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE history_visits
(
    id           INTEGER PRIMARY KEY autoincrement,
    history_item INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES history_items(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    visit_time REAL NOT NULL,
    title text NULL,
    load_successful boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    http_non_get    boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    synthesized     boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    redirect_source INTEGER NULL UNIQUE REFERENCES history_visits(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    redirect_destination INTEGER NULL UNIQUE REFERENCES history_visits(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    origin     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    generation INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    attributes INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    score      INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);
</code></pre><p>Safari stores new history entries in two different formats, one for efficiently looking through <em>distinct</em> history entries, and one for recording visits, with timestamp information. Namely, <code>history_items</code> stores distinct history entries by their URL, and <code>history_visits</code> stores information Safari expects to change with every visit, like the timestamp, load success state, and (curiously) the page title.</p>
<p>From this schema, we can also see that each history visit points to exactly one history item – there can be one or more visits to the same URL. On each visit, Safari will add a new history visit entry and increment some aggregate information for the corresponding history item, like the total <code>visit_count</code>.</p>
<p>Like any good exploration, the answer to one question also opens up many others. What are the <code>score</code>s next to each page? What’s a <code>synthesized</code> visit? What are <code>autocomplete_triggers</code> used for? I haven’t had a chance to dive into those yet, because there’s also plenty of fun to be had playing around with the Histools visualization itself. From the heatmap, I can see when I go to sleep each day and when I wake up in the morning (or the few times I was woken up overnight). I can see when my homework was due, when I was researching certain topics, and so on and on and on.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to spinning up Histools from time to time to get another perspective on how I’ve been using the Web in my life.</p>

<p>
  <strong>﻿By Mikko Haapoja and Stephan Leroux</strong>
</p>
<p>
  2020 Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) is over, and another BFCM Globe has
  shipped. We’re extremely proud of the globe, it focused on realism,
  performance, and the impact our merchants have on the world.
</p>
<figure>
  <p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LPm0xjr2lzo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

</figure>
<p>
  We knew we had a tall task in front of us this year, building something that
  could represent orders from our one million merchants in just two months. Not
  only that, we wanted to ship a data visualization for our merchants so they
  could have a similar experience to the BFCM globe every day in their Live
  View.
</p>
<figure>
  <p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_r6ut_Z7pss?playlist=_r6ut_Z7pss&amp;autoplay=1&amp;loop=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
  <figcaption>Prototypes for the 2020 BFCM Globe and Live View. **</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  With tight timelines and an ambitious initiative, we immediately jumped into
  prototypes with three.js and planned our architecture.
</p>

<p>
  As we planned this project, we converged architecturally on the idea of
  layers. Each layer is similar to a React component where state is minimally
  shared with the rest of the application, and each layer encapsulates its own
  functionality. This allowed for code reuse and flexibility to build both the
  Live View Globe, BFCM Globe, and beyond.
</p>
<figure>
  <p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D56O11Y46o0?playlist=D56O11Y46o0&amp;autoplay=1&amp;loop=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
  <figcaption>A showcase of layers for the 2020 BFCM Globe. **</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  When realism is key, it’s always best to lean on fantastic artists, and that’s
  where
  <a href="https://twitter.com/byrondelgado" target="_blank" title="Byron Delgado on Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Byron Delgado</a>
  came in. We hoped that Byron would be able to use the 3D modeling tools he’s
  used to, and then we would incorporate his 3D models into our experience. This
  is where the <code>EarthRealistic</code> layer comes in.
</p>
<figure>
  <p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N4oeDV4rNQo?playlist=N4oeDV4rNQo&amp;autoplay=1&amp;loop=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
  <figcaption>
    <code>EarthRealistic</code> layer from the 2020 BFCM Globe. **
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  <code>EarthRealistic</code> uses a technique called physically based
  rendering, which most modern 3D modeling software supports. In three.js,
  physically based rendering is implemented via the
  <code>MeshPhysicalMaterial</code> or
  <code>MeshStandardMaterial</code> materials.
</p>
<p>
  To achieve realistic lighting, <code>EarthRealistic</code> is lit by a 32bit
  EXR Environment Map. By using a 32bit EXR, it means we can have smooth image
  based lighting. Image based lighting is a technique where a “360 sphere” is
  created around the 3D scene, and pixels in that image are used to calculate
  how bright Triangles on 3D models should be. This allows for complex lighting
  setups without much effort from an artist. Traditionally images on the web
  such as JPGs and PNGs have a color depth of 8bits. If we were to use these
  formats and 8bit color depth, our globe lighting would have had horrible
  gradient banding, missing realism entirely.
</p>

<p>
  Once we converged on physically based rendering and image based lighting,
  building the carbon offset layer became clearer. Literally!
</p>

</figure>
<p>
  Bubbles have an interesting phenomenon where they can be almost opaque at a
  certain angle and light intensity but in other areas completely transparent.
  To achieve this look, we created a custom material based on
  MeshStandardMaterial that reads in an Environment Map and simulates the bubble
  lighting phenomenon. The following is the easiest way to achieve this with
  three.js:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Create a custom Material class that extends off of MeshStandardMaterial.
  </li>
  <li>
    Write a custom Vertex or Fragment Shader and define any Uniforms for that
    Shader Program.
  </li>
  <li>
    Override
    <code>onBeforeCompile(shader: Shader, _renderer: WebGLRenderer): void&nbsp;</code>on your custom Material and pass the custom Vertex or Fragment Shader and
    uniforms via the Shader instance.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Here’s our implementation of the above for the Carbon Offset Shield Material:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://gist.github.com/ShopifyEng/5e8bfa0de5630779ad7350c7a73cb650" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ShieldMaterial.ts</a>

    - Abstraction on top of MeshStandardMaterial
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://gist.github.com/ShopifyEng/cc1679cfb054f85c8689037e5d168f68" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">shield.frag</a>
    - Custom Fragment shaders that make MeshStandardMaterial look like a bubble
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Let’s look at the above, starting with our Fragment shader. In shield.frag
  lines 94-97
</p>
<figure>
  
</figure>
<p>
  These two lines are all that are needed to achieve a bubble effect in a
  fragment shader.
</p>
<p>
  To calculate the <code>brightness</code> of an rgb pixel, you calculate the
  length or magnitude of the pixel using the GLSL length function. In three.js
  shaders, <code>outgoingLight</code> is an RGB <code>vec3</code> representing
  the outgoing light or pixel to be rendered.
</p>
<p>
  If you remember from earlier, the bubble’s brightness determines how
  transparent or opaque it should appear.&nbsp; After calculating brightness, we can
  set the outgoing pixel’s alpha based on the brightness calculation. Here we
  use the GLSL <code>mix</code> function to go between the expected alpha of the
  pixel defined by <code>diffuseColor.a</code> and a new custom uniform defined
  as <code>maxOpacity</code>. By having the concept of min or expected opacity
  and max opacity, Byron and other artists can tweak visuals to their exact
  liking.
</p>
<p>
  If you look at our shield.frag file, it may seem daunting! What on earth is
  all of this code?&nbsp; three.js materials handle a lot of functionality, so it’s
  best to make small additions and not modify existing code. three.js materials
  all have their own shaders defined in the
  <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/src/renderers/shaders/ShaderLib/" target="_blank" title="ShaderLib folder in three.js repo" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ShaderLib folder</a>. To extend a three.js material, you can grab the original material shader
  code from the <code>src/renderers/shaders/ShaderLib/</code> folder in the
  three.js repo and perform any custom calculations before setting
  <code>gl_FragColor</code>. An easier option to access three.js shader code is
  to simply <code>console.log</code> the <code>shader.fragmentShader</code> or
  <code>shader.vertexShader</code> strings, which are exposed in the
  <code>onBeforeCompile</code> function:
</p>
<figure>
  
</figure>
<p>
  <code>onBeforeCompile</code> runs immediately before the Shader Program is
  created on the GPU. Here you can override shaders and uniforms.
  CustomMeshStandardMaterial.ts is an abstraction we wrote to make creating
  custom materials easier. It overrides the
  <code>onBeforeCompile</code> function and manages uniforms while your
  application runs via the
  <a href="https://gist.github.com/ShopifyEng/5a0c15b0c83ed00b66267b93994714cf#file-custommeshstandardmaterial-ts-L51" target="_blank" title="setCustomUniform in CustomMeshStandardMaterial.ts" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>setCustomUniform</code></a>
  and

  functions. You can see this in action in our custom Shield Material when
  getting and setting <code>maxOpacity</code>:

<h2>Using Particles to Display Orders</h2>

  <figcaption>
    Displaying orders on Shopify from across the world using particles. **
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  One of the BFCM globe’s main features is the ability to view orders happening
  in real-time from our merchants and their buyers worldwide. Given Shopify’s
  scale and amount of orders happening during BFCM, it’s challenging to visually
  represent all of the orders happening at any given time. We wanted to find a
  way to showcase the sheer volume of orders our merchants receive over this
  time in both a visually compelling and performant way.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  In the past, we used visual “arcs” to display the connection between a buyer’s
  and a merchant’s location.
</p>
<figure>
  <img alt="The BFCM Globe from 2018 showing orders using visual arcs." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/old-globe.jpg?v=1607052787" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/old-globe.jpg?v=1607052787">
  <figcaption>
    The BFCM Globe from 2018 showing orders using visual arcs.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  With thousands of orders happening every minute, using arcs alone to represent
  every order quickly became a visual mess along with a heavy decrease in
  framerate. One solution was to cap the number of arcs we display, but this
  would only allow us to display a small fraction of the orders we were
  processing. Instead, we investigated using a particle-based solution to help
  fill the gap.
</p>
<p>With particles, we wanted to see if we could:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Handle thousands of orders at any given time on screen.</li>
  <li>Maintain 60 frames per second on low-end devices.</li>
  <li>
    Have the ability to customize style and animations per order, such as
    visualizing local and international orders.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  From the start, we figured that rendering geometry per an order wouldn't scale
  well if we wanted to have thousands of orders on screen. Particles appear on
  the globe as highlights, so they don’t necessarily need to have a 3D
  perspective. Rather than using triangles for each particle, we began our
  investigation using three.js <code>Points</code> as a start, which allowed us
  to draw using dots instead. Next, we needed an efficient way to store data for
  each particle we wanted to render. Using <code>BufferGeometry</code>, we
  assigned custom attributes that contained all the information we needed for
  each particle/order.
</p>
<figure>
  
</figure>
<p>
  To render the points and make use of our attributes, we created a
  <code>ShaderMaterial</code>, and custom vertex and fragment shaders. Most of
  the magic for rendering and animating the particles happens inside the vertex
  shader. Each particle defined in the attributes we pass to our
  <code>BufferGeometry</code> goes through a series of steps and
  transformations.
</p>
<p>
  First, each particle has a starting and ending location described using
  latitude and longitude. Since we want the particle to travel along the surface
  and not through it, we use a geo interpolation function on our coordinates to
  find a path that goes along the surface.
</p>
<figure>
  <img alt="A photo of a globe with an order represented as a particle traveling from New York City to London. The vertex shader uses each location’s latitude and longitude and determines the path it needs to travel." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/particle-diagram-1.jpg?v=1607053616" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/particle-diagram-1.jpg?v=1607053616">
  <figcaption>

    The vertex shader uses each location’s latitude and longitude and determines
    the path it needs to travel. **
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Next, to give the particle height along its path, we use high school geometry,
  a parabola equation based on time to alter the straight path to a curve.
</p>
<figure>
  <img alt="A photo of a globe with particles that follow a curved path away from the earth’s surface using a parabola equation to determine its height." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/particle-diagram-2.jpg?v=1607053702" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/particle-diagram-2.jpg?v=1607053702">
  <figcaption>
    Particles follow a curved path away from the earth’s surface using a
    parabola equation to determine its height. **
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  To render the particle to make it look 3D in its travels, we combine our
  height and projected path data then convert it to a vector position our shader
  uses as it’s <code>gl_Position</code>. With our particle now knowing where it
  needs to go, using a <code>time</code> uniform, we drive animations for other
  changes such as size and color. At the end of the vertex shader, we pass the
  position and point size to render onto the fragment shader that combines the
  calculated color and alpha at the time for each particle.

<p>I’m starting at a new company on Monday so I’ve been panic-reading management and leadership books. I’ve boiled a lot of that advice down into this week by week plan.</p>



<p><em>Important caveat: “plans are useless, but planning is indispensable” and all that. Stay flexible, shift things around as needed, don’t hold off on something that needs to happen just because it’s not in the plan, blah blah blah.</em></p>



<p><strong>Week 1</strong>: Find someone, anyone, and grab a 30 minute call with them. Here’s the agenda (stolen from <a href="https://boz.com/articles/career-cold-start">this post</a>):</p>



<ul><li>“Tell me everything you think I should know.” – 25 minutes</li><li>“What are the biggest challenges the team has right now?” – 3 minutes</li><li>“Who else should I talk to?” – 2 minutes</li></ul>



<p>Next, repeat that process with all of the names you get from that last question, and <em>keep repeating with every name you get until you run out of new names</em>. That should get you a nice jump start on knowledge transfer. You may even find a few easy problems to solve for quick wins.</p>



<p><strong>Weeks 1-3</strong>: Listen in on regular meetings and ask lots of questions. Don’t shy away from asking for clarification on things asynchronously after the meeting is over. And remember, <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/17/stop-trying-to-be-impressive-start-trying-to-be-warm/">be warm, not impressive</a>.</p>



<p>Don’t start 1-1s yet, and don’t try to do anything useful. Your goal for weeks 1-3 is to meet as many people as you can and learn as much as you can.</p>



<p>Also, sometime in weeks 1-3, start asking about any <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/16/the-2-responsibilities-of-a-manager/">shared measurable goals</a> for the team. How do you know if you’re succeeding? How is your impact being measured? Do those measures exist? If they don’t exist, then we’ll come back to this in a few weeks.</p>



<p><strong>Week 3</strong>: Send an email or a group chat message about starting 1-1s and list some available times so that people can choose the times that are best for them. Mention the format you plan to use so they can prep.</p>



<p><strong>Week 4</strong>: Start having weekly 1-1s. You won’t be giving any feedback in these 1-1s (or elsewhere) for a few more weeks. So for now your job is to get to know your directs and to support them however they need.</p>



<p><strong>Week 8</strong>: If the team already has measurable goals related to impact and business outcomes, then skip this step. Otherwise, now is the time to start figuring out what those goals should be. I talked about this in “<a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/16/the-2-responsibilities-of-a-manager/">The 2 responsibilities of a&nbsp;manager</a>.”</p>



<p><strong>Week 12</strong>: Now that you have 3 months under your belt, fill out <a href="https://gist.github.com/mikecrittenden/faf2e60282912a809f1aac1423116268">the assessment at the end of “The Five Dysfunctions of a Team”</a>. That should give you a sense of which, if any, dysfunctions to focus on.</p>



<p>Also, start giving positive feedback. Send an email or group message letting people know that you’re going to start this, and tell them about <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/26/5-second-feedback/">the format it’ll follow</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Weeks 12-20</strong>: Give only positive feedback, early and often. To start, aim to give 1 piece of positive feedback to someone everyday, then increase it from there. Build up to a steady stream.</p>



<p><strong>Week 20</strong>: Now that you hopefully have earned some trust, you can start also giving negative feedback. Let your reports know ahead of time that it’s coming so they won’t be caught off guard. And remember, <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/27/future-focused-feedback/">don’t debate the past</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Week 30</strong>: By now you’ve been giving feedback for a while, so you should have a good sense of where to add <a href="https://www.manager-tools.com/2009/07/coaching-model-revised">more formal coaching</a>. Set goals with your reports and talk through a granular step by step plan for achieving it.</p>



<p>And just like that, you’re more than half a year in. You’re on your own from here. Good luck!</p>

                    <p>As a privacy friendly company who work mainly with newsletters, we spend a lot of time thinking about the ethics of email. </p><p>We've recently been working on a sort of "code of ethics" for email senders who are interested in privacy, and after getting a lot of feedback have condensed our main points down to the following. This is still a work in progress (and in some places <em>highly</em> subjective), so if you have any feedback at all then please raise a ticket on the <a href="https://github.com/leavemealone-app/ethical-email-manifesto">GitHub repo</a>, or leave a comment on the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25303911">Hacker News discussion</a>. </p><p>Let's start off with a simple one. Above all else, recurring emails should be opt-in. If I receive an email from you it <strong><em>should not be a surprise</em></strong>.</p><p>In real terms this means;</p><ul><li>For newsletter creators, if someone signed up for your monthly newsletter, then don't sometimes send them weekly without asking.</li><li>For app makers and SaaS, a welcome email is okay, but don't automatically add a new customer to your automated Drip campaign of 25 on-boarding emails.</li></ul><p>This really is a no-brainer and benefits everyone. If you send emails that people don't expect, you make them angry and more likely to mark you as spam, hurting your reputation.</p><p>I've spoken about this before, letting your recipients easily unsubscribe from emails helps to maintain a healthy mailing list. But lets go one step further...</p><p>Being granted permission to send an email to a persons inbox <strong>should be treated as a privilege</strong>, and we should respect their right to easily deny us that permission at any time and for any reason.</p><p>This means we must provide an unsubscribe link within each email that is accessible to the recipient, this link should ideally unsubscribe in <em>one-click</em> and not require any additional steps.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote>Being granted permission to send an email to a persons inbox should be treated as a privilege</blockquote><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The best way to do this is to provide an "unsubscribe" link in the email body. This should be clear and purposeful by;</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>Using clear language
<ul>
<li>"Click here to unsubscribe" is good</li>
<li>"Manage your preferences here" is not.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Being accessible
<ul>
<li>Make your unsubscribe link obvious</li>
<li>Keep the contrast ratio high - eg don't use light grey text on a white background. This is not cool.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>If possible, it's also good to provide a machine-readable <code>List-Unsubscribe</code> header with every email (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2369.txt">RFC 2369</a>). This allows automated tools to help your recipients unsubscribe. The URL in the List-Unsubscribe can be the same as the one you use in your unsubscribe link in the email body.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>List-Unsubscribe: 
    &lt;http://www.host.com/list.cgi?cmd=unsub&amp;lst=list&gt;,
    &lt;mailto:<a href="https://blog.leavemealone.app/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="86eaeff5f2abf4e3f7f3e3f5f2c6eee9f5f2a8e5e9eb">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>?subject=unsubscribe&gt;
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>In case this doesn't go without saying, if a recipient unsubscribes from your mailing list then you should not send them any more emails from that address!</p><p>P.S. Recently I've seen more mailing lists including an unsubscribe link at the top of the email as well as at the bottom. This seems like a great idea.</p><p>There should be no doubt why someone is receiving your email, or how frequently they should expect it. It sucks to receive an email but not know why.</p><p>I understand that recipients may forget that they signed up for your service or to receive your newsletter (especially if it is not sent frequently), so make the intent of the email clear at the start. For example, by leading the content with the sentence "You are receiving this email because you signed up for an account on example.com".</p><p>Newsletter creators, if you sent emails on a schedule then let your recipient know when they will receive your next email.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://blog.leavemealone.app/content/images/2020/12/image.png"><figcaption>Here's how we manage this in some of our recurring emails</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>There's also an email header for this as well, the <code>List-Help</code> header. This provides a place to discover more information about the mailing list.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>List-Help: &lt;http://www.host.com/list/&gt;, &lt;mailto:<a href="https://blog.leavemealone.app/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="b7dbdec4c39aded9d1d8f7dfd8c4c399d4d8da">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>&gt;
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Probably the most controversial point I need to make - emails should not contain spy-pixels/pixel-trackers or any other mechanism that measures open-rates.</p><p>I know it's nice to see how many people are opening your emails, but since this tracking can be done without the consent of the recipient, it should be considered a violation of privacy. Requiring recipients to disable images in their email client in order to not be tracked is <strong>not </strong>acceptable.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://blog.leavemealone.app/content/images/2020/12/image-1.png"><figcaption>Read tracking can be crazy intrusive (image courtesy of the SuperHuman exposé last year)</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>If you wish to see if recipients are engaging with your emails, then provide actionable elements for them. For example, clicking a link in the email is easily measurable, shows engagement, and is less intrusive.</p><p>Ideally, I think it would be nice to return to mainly plaintext emails, with a few embedded images here and there. Embedded images don't have to be fetched from an external server, and thus can't be used for tracking purposes. I <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesIvings/status/1334796362416877569">tweeted some info</a> on how to embed images recently if you want more info on this.</p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><p>I think these 4 points cover most shady email practices, a good start!</p><p>None of this is governed by any specific law, but a bunch of it probably falls under either CAN-SPAM or GDPR email regulations. </p><p>That said, governments have been consistently slow to react with regards to protecting online privacy and barely enforce any protections they have managed to pass. So I think the best way forward is encourage email senders to act ethically, and as consumers, point out ethical violations and not do business with those who do not meet our standards wherever possible.</p><p>There's a long way to go in this space, and I want to explore it in the open with as much feedback as possible. My first draft of an <em>Ethical Email Manifesto</em> that we will be following at my company is <a href="https://github.com/leavemealone-app/ethical-email-manifesto">public on GitHub</a> and open to contributions.</p><p>If you want to support this movement and tell the world you're an "ethical email sender", then <a href="https://github.com/leavemealone-app/ethical-email-manifesto/issues">open an issue</a> and we'll add your company as a signatory to the document ❤</p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><p>Agree (or disagree) with me about any of this? Jump on the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25303911">HN thread</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesIvings">follow me on Twitter</a>, where I post a lot about shady email practices.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html-->

<div id="sites-canvas-main-content">
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div><div dir="ltr"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am widely credited as the inventor of the &lt;blink&gt; tag. &nbsp; For those of you who are relatively new to the Web, the &lt;blink&gt; tag is an HTML command that causes text to blink, and many, many people find its behavior to be extremely annoying. &nbsp;&nbsp; I won't deny the invention, but there is a bit more to the story than is widely known.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back in 1994 I was a founding engineer at Netscape, prior to that I had written the Lynx browser, which predated all of the other popular browsers at that time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lynx had been and still is a text only browser and is commonly used in a console window on UNIX machines.&nbsp;&nbsp; At Netscape we were building software that used a graphical user interface and could express vastly more text styles and layouts as well as images and other media.&nbsp;&nbsp; We spent a lot of time thinking about the future of the web and new technologies that would enable new classes of documents, applications and uses. &nbsp;&nbsp; A few examples of those thoughts were, HTML Tables, SSL for secure communications, Plugins for extensions, and JavaScript to enable dynamic HTML.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometime in late summer I took a break with some of the other engineers and went to a local bar on Castro street in Mountain View.&nbsp;&nbsp; The bar was the St. James Infirmary and it had a 30 foot wonder woman statue inside among other interesting things.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At some point in the evening I mentioned that it was sad that Lynx was not going to be able to display many of the HTML extensions&nbsp; that we were proposing,&nbsp; I also pointed out that the only text style that Lynx could exploit given its environment was blinking text.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had a pretty good laugh at the thought of blinking text, and talked about blinking this and that and how absurd the whole thing would be.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The evening progressed pretty normally from there, with a fair amount more drinking and me meeting the girl who would later become my first wife. </p><p>&nbsp; Saturday morning rolled around and I headed into the office only to find what else but, blinking text.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was on the screen blinking in all its glory, and in the browser.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How could this be, you might ask?&nbsp;&nbsp; It turns out that one of the engineers liked my idea so much that he left the bar sometime past midnight, returned to the office and implemented the blink tag overnight.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was still there in the morning and quite proud of it.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time there were 3 versions of the browser that ran on UNIX, Windows and Mac operating systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a short 12 hours the blinking was constrained only to the UNIX version, but it didn't take long for the blinking to spread to Windows and then the Mac version.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember thinking that this would be a pretty harmless easter egg, that no one would really use it, but I was very wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we released Netscape Navigator 1.0 we did not document the blink functionality in any way, and for a while all was quiet.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then somewhere, somehow the arcane knowledge of blinking leaked into the real world and suddenly everything was blinking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look here", "buy this", "check this out", all blinking.&nbsp;&nbsp; Large advertisements blinking in all their glory.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a lot like Las Vegas, except it was on my screen, with no way of turning it off. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the end, much was said, most of it in the form of flaming posts to various discussion boards, and the &lt;blink&gt; tag will probably be remembered as the most hated of all HTML tags.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to publicly state that at no time did I actually write code or even seriously advocate for the &lt;blink&gt; tag.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is true that I put forth the initial inspiration, but it really was merely a thought experiment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not going to name any names of the people who coded the dastardly deed, if they wish to step forward, they will need to do it themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the end, the thing that I am truly sad about, is that Lynx never did get to blink.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am also sad to report that the St James Infirmary burned to the ground in 1997, it was a great place to hang out and will be missed.<br></p><p>&lt;blink&gt; on,</p><p>:lou<br></p></div></div></div>

<![CDATA[The Murder of Wilbur Wright – How many of our greatest minds have we lost?]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
       <p>How many of our greatest minds have we lost?</p>
<p>From The Dream Machine (p50) on John Atanasoff:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>He was determined to build a computing machine… But with all his teaching responsibilities, he’d had very little time to focus on the problem.</strong> Finally, however, on a bitterly cold winter night in late 1937, he just couldn’t take it anymore; he had to get away to concentrate. So he jumped into his car in Ames, Iowa, and drove east through the subzero temperature at more than eighty miles per hour. Almost three hours later, after he crossed the Mississippi River into Illinois, he stopped at a roadhouse to warm up. And there, somewhere between his first and second bourbons, he conceived four crucial ideas to make him computer work.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Incredible! Atanasoff was busy, but finally got down to doing the thing he really loved, the world recognized his genius, and he was given all the resources he needed to complete his work.</p>
<p>At least, that’s what would have happened in any reasonable society. Instead, we’re told:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Atanasoff didn’t develop his invention any further, as it happened. Soon after the United States entered the war, in December 1941, he went to the Naval Ordinance Laboratory in Washington, D.C., where he supervised the counting testing of mines. <strong>He never returned to computing.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who knows what else he could have given us? Instead, his entire lifetime produces one brief period of real scientific producitivity, bookended by teaching responsibilities and war.</p>
<p>Once you start looking, these stories are everwhere. Here’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Unix">The Daemon, the Gnu and the Penguin</a> on the invention of Unix:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In August 1969, Ken Thompson’s wife Bonnie took their year-old son on a trip to California to show off to their families. As a temporary bachelor, Ken had time to work. “I allocated a week each to the operating system, the shell, the editor and the assembler [he told me]… and during the month she was gone, it was totally rewritten in a form that looked like an operating system”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe this is a greatly exaggerated myth, but how terrifying would it be if that was true? Is it possible that Thompson was burdened by responsibilities his entire life, and then in a brief moment of freedom did some of the most important work anyone has ever done?</p>
<p>And then from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_brothers#Wilbur">Wikipedia</a>, on Wilbur Wright:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…Wilbur never flew again. He gradually became occupied with business matters for the Wright Company and dealing with different lawsuits. Upon dealing with the patent lawsuits, which had put great strain on both brothers, Wilbur had written in a letter to a French friend, “<strong>When we think what we might have accomplished if we had been able to devote this time to experiments, we feel very sad</strong>, but it is always easier to deal with things than with men, and no one can direct his life entirely as he would choose.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But why on earth not? Why couldn’t Wilbur Wright, now admired as one of history’s greatest investors, find time to continue his most important work? The story continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wilbur spent the next year before his death traveling, where he spent a full six months in Europe attending to various business and legal matters… He was also constantly back and forth between New York, Washington and Dayton. All of the stresses were taking a toll on Wilbur physically. Orville would remark that he would “come home white”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then finally:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After returning to Dayton in early May 1912, worn down in mind and body, he fell ill again and was diagnosed with typhoid fever. He lingered on, his symptoms relapsing and remitting for many days. Wilbur died, at age 45, at the Wright family home on May 30.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These were some of the most brilliant minds we had, and they were each nearly unable to fulfil even a tiny fraction of their potential. We should ask how much more each of them could have accomplished, but also how much we’ve lost from would-be inventors unable to find even a month of genuine free time with which to pursue their dreams. And of course, how many have been effectively barred from research by poverty or discrimination.</p>
<p>What hits me hardest is not the material loss, but the squandering of human spirit. As <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://vimeo.com/115154289">Bret Victor once explained</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We recognize that a dog has to be allowed the full free expression of its entire range of capabilities. Sticking him in a cage or constraining his range of experience, you’re not letting him do all the things that dogs can do. And this is exactly what we’ve done to ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so the stories above strike me not even as tragedies, but as something more inhumane.</p>
<p>My greatest fear is that intelligent life will arrive on earth. It won’t be an invasion, or colonization, or anything horrible. They’ll just sit us down, and ask about the lives of our heroes.</p>
<p>We’ll proudly tell them about this guy Wilbur Wright. How he and his brother invented a machine to fly in the sky as gods. We’ll tell them about our culture of research and innovation, and how Wilbur, self-taught engineer from Ohio, changed the entire world.</p>
<p>And then we’ll have to explain how gruesomely we murdered him.</p>
<p>Not with sticks and stones, but with a barrage of patent lawsuits. We will have to tell the aliens how we used this great system of socially legitimate torture to slowly wear him down over the years.</p>
<p>We will tell them how in the end, poor brilliant Wilbur became old and tired and incapable of producing anything beautiful ever again.</p>
<p>I do not think they will forgive us. I am not sure we should forgive ourselves.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>See Also</strong><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://guzey.com/patronage-and-research-labs/">Reviving Patronage and Revolutionary Industrial Research</a></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Yes, I understand that Wilbur also sued people. I’m not claiming that he was a good person. My point is that in a humane world, no part of this story would even be possible.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Every day I get up, I find it hard to keep up the momentum. Things don't happen as I expected. When I publish a piece of content, I expect many people would consume it. But it doesn't. Although it's fun to create content and express my creativity, I'm sometimes frustrated because it doesn't get any engagement.</p>
<p>I have to motivate myself to keep going. I have watched an anime series recently. It's Run with the Wind. The series is about a group of 10 college students who are trying to take part in a marathon contest. They don't have any experience in running and have to run 5km in 16 minutes to meet the qualification. After all, they meet the qualification and take part in the contest. They get in the top 10.</p>
<p>There are many inspiring quotes in the series. I rewatch it 3 times and will watch one more time. These quotes help to motivate me. I find myself in the series. I am doing what I like and happy with it. But I can't be happy all the time. My process is not always linear. </p>
<p>To motivate myself, I choose to consume other creator's content. I read blogs and books, watch videos and anime. While consuming content, I can have new ideas for my content. It also inspires me to keep going because if they can, me too.</p>

<p>For authors, deciding between Gumroad vs. Amazon KDP is not always a straightforward answer. </p>



<p>I’ve been a huge advocate of Amazon KDP (Kindle Direct Publishing) for several years now, and most of my books are published on that platform. </p>



<p>However, I decided to self publish my latest book on Gumroad, and I wanted to share my thoughts about which one I think is best for authors.</p>



<p>I have also gathered some insights from other authors who have used one or both platforms.</p>







<h2>Gumroad vs. Amazon KDP: Quick Summary</h2>



<p>This is a <em>really </em>long post (3,900+ words, which will take you around 17 minutes to read), so here’s the TL;DR version if you don’t have a lot of time:</p>



<p>Both Amazon and Gumroad have some advantages and disadvantages for authors. And what works best depends on your objective and on your current situation.</p>



<p>If you want to <strong>maximize profits</strong>, already have a <strong>fairly large audience</strong>, and <strong>have the time and energy</strong> to direct traffic to your book, then <strong>Gumroad </strong>is the best option for you.</p>



<p>If you care more about <strong>brand value</strong>, have a <strong>smaller audience</strong>, and want to <strong>rely more on organic traffic/ reach</strong> for readers to find your book, then <strong>Amazon KDP</strong> is the best option for you.</p>



<p>You can, of course, publish on both platforms at the same time, but there are some considerations that you have to factor in.</p>



<p>Here are some more details about the advantages and disadvantages of each, and which one wins in each category.</p>







<h2>Gumroad vs. Amazon KDP: Fees &amp; Royalties</h2>



<p>Let’s start with a foundational question. What are the fees you have to pay and royalties (i.e. profit margins) you get on each platform?</p>



<h3>Amazon KDP</h3>



<p>With Amazon, you can publish your book for free (i.e. there are no listing fees), and there are no monthly fees. Your royalties fall between <strong>35%</strong> and <strong>70%</strong>, depending on the book’s price point. </p>



<p>If you list your book’s price between <strong>$2.99</strong> and <strong>$9.99</strong>, then you’ll get a <strong>70%</strong> royalty (i.e., your profit is 70% of the book’s price point).</p>



<p>However, if you list your book’s price between<strong> $0.99 </strong>(lowest price allowed) and <strong>$2.99 </strong>or between<strong> $9.99</strong> and <strong>$200.00</strong> (highest price allowed), then you’ll get a <strong>35%</strong> royalty (i.e., you only get paid 35% of the book’s price point).</p>



<p>In other words, Amazon tries to incentivize you to price your book between <strong>$2.99 and $9.99</strong> because that’s a sweet spot for sales. </p>



<p><em>Note: This applies to the ebook (i.e. Kindle) version of your book’s price point. The paperback version on Amazon has a different royalty structure.</em><br></p>



<h3>Gumroad</h3>



<p>With Gumroad, you have two options to publish your book. You can do it for free (i.e. no monthly fees), or you can upgrade to a premium account that costs you $10 per month (or $108 per year).</p>



<p>Upgrading to a premium account gives you a few advantages that you can read about <a href="https://gumroad.com/features/pricing">here</a>.</p>



<p>In terms of fees, you pay an <strong>8.5% + $0.30</strong> fee per sale on the free account, and <strong>3.5% + $0.30</strong> fee per sale on the premium account.</p>



<p>In other words, your royalty will be between approximately <strong>91% and 96%</strong> of your book’s price point (which is much higher than Amazon’s <strong>35% to 70%</strong>). </p>



<p>So Gumroad definitely wins here.</p>



<p>Another important factor that plays in Gumroad’s favor is “price anchoring.” Given that Amazon persuades authors to price their book between $2.99 and $9.99, most books are listed within that range, which makes it’s very hard to justify selling a $47 Kindle ebook.</p>



<p>Gumroad doesn’t have that problem.</p>



<h4><strong>Winner</strong>: <strong>Gumroad</strong></h4>







<h2>Gumroad vs. Amazon KDP: eBook Formats</h2>



<p>When you submit your ebook to Amazon, you have to meet their specific guidelines because Amazon converts your book into their proprietary ebook file format. You can format your book using Microsoft Word or by using Amazon’s own tool called “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Create/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=18292298011">Kindle Create</a>.” </p>



<p>You can also submit other formats, such as PDF, but those end up causing some formatting challenges when they’re converted to Kindle-specific files.</p>



<p>The way your readers read your Kindle book is either on a Kindle device (e.g., a Kindle Fire Tablet or a Kindle Paperwhite) or on a free Kindle app installed on any other device (e.g., iPhone, iPad, Android phone, computer, etc.). </p>



<p>When you submit your ebook to Gumroad, you basically upload whatever file format your readers will end up downloading. You can also upload multiple files of the same book.</p>



<p>For example, you might want to offer your book in PDF format only.  Or you might want to offer it in PDF, MOBI, ePUB, and HTML. Gumroad basically acts as a document repository and you can upload the same files that you want your customers to view.</p>



<p><em>Note: If you want your Gumroad customers to be able to read your book on their Kindle devices, then make sure you upload the Kindle-friendly MOBI version of your book.</em></p>



<p>Gumroad wins in this category because of the file format flexibility. </p>



<p>For example, I’m writing a new book about <a href="https://www.thecouchmanager.com/home-office-book-launch">how to design a home office</a> and because it’s picture heavy (and the layout needs tweaking) the best format that will work for me is PDF.</p>



<p>And because I wouldn’t be able to do replicate that layout in Amazon without some serious design challenges, I’ll be selling that book exclusively on Gumroad.</p>



<h4>Winner: Gumroad</h4>







<h2>Gumroad vs. Amazon KDP: Paperback Copies</h2>



<p>Most authors want to (and probably should) sell paperback copies of their book. That’s because some readers still prefer to hold physical copies of books, and it would be a mistake to ignore that potential revenue stream.</p>



<p>Here’s a recent screenshot of revenue from my books. Notice the difference between the ebook and paperback royalties.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="871" height="290" src="https://www.writerontheside.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png" alt="Amazon ebook royalty vs. paperback royalty" srcset="https://www.writerontheside.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png 871w, https://www.writerontheside.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-300x100.png 300w, https://www.writerontheside.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-768x256.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 871px) 100vw, 871px"></figure>



<p>With Amazon, creating a paperback version of your book is very simple. You’ll need to convert your manuscript to a print-ready file (easy to do within Amazon KDP) and then upload a print-ready cover (that you’ll need to have designed).</p>



<p>After you publish, Amazon then simply prints your book as soon as someone orders it (called POD, which stands for print-on-demand) and ships it to them. So you don’t have to worry about inventory or paying for print copies upfront.</p>



<p>Gumroad unfortunately does not provide any of those print-on-demand capabilities, which means that you will not be able to sell any paperback copies of your book.</p>



<p>The only potential alternative is to do this manually by pre-printing copies of your book yourself and then physically sell &amp; ship them when someone makes an order (not very practical, and not very cheap). </p>



<h4>Winner: Amazon KDP</h4>







<h2>Gumroad vs. Amazon KDP: Organic Reach</h2>



<p>Organic reach is about how people find your book and how effectively each platform recommends it. </p>



<p>With Amazon, over <strong>95%</strong> of my book sales come from organic sales. In other words, it’s mostly from Amazon’s own algorithm. I don’t get a lot of sales from my own efforts of directing people to buy my books. </p>



<p><em>Note: Amazon does not disclose any data about statistics or traffic sources, so I couldn’t give you exact numbers. However, I do track my own sales channels through affiliate links to my books, and that’s why I can estimate organic sales at around 95%.</em></p>



<p>With Gumroad, it’s almost the exact opposite. For sales of my last book, only around <strong>7%</strong> of the sales came in from Gumroad’s organic reach, and <strong>93%</strong> came from my own direct efforts, so I have to do a lot more marketing to sell those books. </p>



<p>So for me, Amazon wins because of three reasons. </p>



<p>First, I can depend a bit more on sales as passive income and I don’t have to constantly market my books.</p>



<p>Second, the volume of readers and traffic on Amazon is much higher than the volume on Gumroad.</p>



<p>Third, Amazon has a sophisticated search algorithm that recommends books to readers based on recent events or on their search/ purchase history.</p>



<p>And all three factors converged for me during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>I wrote a book around 6 years ago (called “<em><a href="https://amzn.to/2EAeP7I">Influencing Virtual Teams</a></em>“) and it was making around $200 a month. Then, during the pandemic, there was a sudden spike in interest about remote work, and the book ended up making 10X that amount in a couple of those months. </p>



<p>Although Amazon wins in this category, I do have to give Gumroad two advantages here. First, they are open about their sales sources, so I can get much better statistics. And second, I made over <a href="https://www.writerontheside.com/final-results-3294usd-in-30-days-from-the-book-part-9/">$3,294 in sales in one month</a> from one book, so the higher price-point of the book could pay off for you.</p>



<h4>Winner: Amazon KDP</h4>







<h2>Gumroad vs. Amazon KDP: Reader Emails</h2>



<p>An essential feature for authors is the ability to collect emails from their customers. There are many reasons why, but in summary, it’s to be able to stay in touch with readers and build a relationship with them so you can sell other books (or products/ services) down the line. </p>



<p>Amazon does not give authors the capability to view any of those email addresses. In fact, authors have absolutely no visibility about who their customers are. There is a workaround, where authors can offer customers a freebie in exchange for their email address, but that takes <a href="https://www.writerontheside.com/how-to-collect-email-addresses-from-readers/">a bit of effort to set up</a>, and you’ll still not capture 100% of your customers.</p>



<p>Gumroad not only gives you your customers’ information (including email addresses), but it also allows you to communicate with them through Gumroad’s email messaging system directly. You can even export those email addresses and import them into your email management system (such as <a href="https://www.writerontheside.com/aweber" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">AWeber</a>) if you’d like to. So it’s a no brainer that Gumroad wins here.</p>











<h2>Gumroad vs Amazon KDP: Listing Your Book for Free</h2>



<p>Some authors like the idea of offering one or more of their books for free to help them with branding and even making <a href="https://www.writerontheside.com/ep-025-getting-200x-more-downloads-by-offering-your-book-for-free/">money indirectly</a>. </p>



<p>With Amazon, you can list your book for free on a limited basis only (for 5 days every 90 day period if you’re enrolled in <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/select" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">KDP Select</a>).  You can also list it as a “Permanently Free” book, but that’s not a simple process.</p>



<p>However, if you are able to list your book for free on Amazon, you’ll get the advantage of the high volume of traffic. I listed one of my books …</p></div></article></main></div></div></div></div></div>

<p><span>T</span>he Indiranagar 100-Feet Road is the commercial heart of India’s technology capital Bangalore, lined with international brand stores, bars, restaurants, and food courts. Owning retail space here, alongside consumer giant Reliance Digital and German footwear brand Puma, is a marker of success for brands breaking into mainstream consciousness. Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi’s two-story, 6,000-square-foot flagship store is right at the heart of the district. Behind its saffron frontage is a showcase for its as-yet-unlaunched handsets, televisions, laptops, fitness bands, e-scooters, and water purifiers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In June, the store had a complete facelift. A new logo was put on the front of the building that read: “Made In India.” By August, the interior had been decorated with tricolored balloons in the green, white, and orange of the Indian flag. Along the walls, a company timeline showed the history of Xiaomi’s manufacturing operations in India. Mentions of the company’s heritage — it was founded in Beijing in 2010 — disappeared. <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/xiaomi-puts-up-made-in-india-banner-outside-stores-to-counter-boycott-china-campaign-1692633-2020-06-25">Hundreds</a> of the company’s stores across the country underwent the same transformation. “Super proud to share that majority of our TVs are #MadeInIndia! We employ thousands of team members across our India factories #ProudIndian,” <a href="https://twitter.com/manukumarjain/status/1276052185638252544?s=20">tweeted</a> Manu Kumar Jain, the India head of Xiaomi.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anti-China sentiment had already been rising in India’s heartlands before a skirmish in June in a disputed Himalayan border region left 20 Indian soldiers dead. Nationalists started <a href="https://www.thequint.com/news/india/bharat-mata-and-chinese-tvs-a-tale-of-boycotting-goods-from-china">smashing</a> Chinese-made televisions; one minister called for shutting down <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/restaurants-and-hotels-that-sell-chinese-food-should-be-shut-down-union-minister-ramdas-athawale/videoshow/76442910.cms">Chinese restaurants</a>. A few weeks after the skirmish, the Indian government banned TikTok, along with hundreds of Chinese apps, and, in August, passed an <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/55642551-f6e8-4f9d-b5ba-a12d2fc26ef9">unofficial</a> order to phase out dependence on Chinese telecom equipment, including 5G networks. Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a special appearance on television encouraging Indians to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xmx92Q_kQ4">“vocal” in their support for “local” products</a>, creating the #vocalforlocal slogan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chinese smartphone makers like Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi — who made up 81% of the Indian market — were left in a precarious position after the clash. Right-wing groups gathered outside Oppo’s factory in the outskirts of Delhi and <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2020/jun/20/anti-china-demonstration-held-outside-oppo-factory-in-greater-noida-32-protesters-booked-2159224.html">burnt effigies of Xi Jinping</a>, as they demanded that the plant be closed. Some companies battened down the hatches, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/electronics/chinese-brands-endorsers-may-go-slow-on-promotions-some-pull-out-ads-some-plan-to-play-up-make-in-india-credentials/articleshow/76429828.cms?from=mdr">suspending their prime-time advertising campaigns</a>. Vivo <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/ipl-title-sponsor-vivo-pulls-out-of-tournament-this-year-amid-row-2274036">pulled out</a> as the title sponsor of the country’s biggest sporting event, the Indian Premier League cricket competition, after an aggressive campaign against it on social media. Stray protests took place outside some Xiaomi stores, as threats of vandalism loomed large and mobile shipments from China were <a href="https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/smartphone-makers-in-panic-mode-over-stranded-shipments/76536342">stalled for manual inspection at Indian ports</a>.</p>



<p>But while other Chinese brands retreated from the limelight, Xiaomi pursued a unique — and potentially high-risk — strategy: It presented itself as not being Chinese after all, but Indian. Jain, its figurehead in India, took to television, newspapers, and social media to talk up the company’s all-Indian local leadership team and the thousands of jobs it had created in manufacturing and retail. “We are more Indian than anyone else,” Jain told <a href="https://twitter.com/manukumarjain/status/1274316181235568645?lang=en">CNBC-TV18</a>. The company even donated money to the families of soldiers “<a href="https://www.mi.com/in/service/support/crpffund.html">martyred</a>” in Kashmir.</p>



<p>Jain has proven adept in using social media and his own personal brand to launder Xiaomi’s origins. But the company faces growing pressure in an unstable political environment. Narendra Modi’s government is once again proclaiming its desire to bring manufacturing back to India, offering <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-10/india-mulls-23-billion-package-to-lure-global-manufacturers?sref=QYWxDQ1o">lavish incentives</a> for export-led manufacturers, which may help once-moribund local phone brands. Xiaomi has indeed moved some of its production onshore, but the core components of its devices are still made in China. With the country’s nationalist surge unlikely to end soon, Jain and Xiaomi will eventually have to face up to the question: How Indian is Indian enough?</p>

<p><strong>Jain, 39, “is</strong> the Indian middle-class dream personified,” in the words of a former colleague. As a child, he lived in Meerut in northern India, alongside 150 members of his extended family, in an isolated housing compound inside a military quarters built by his great grandfather. “I had never even been exposed to the outside world,” Jain says.</p>



<p>After studying at the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology and at the Indian Institute of Management business school, he joined the global consulting firm McKinsey.</p>



<p>Jain’s early career in technology was successful but low profile. He quit McKinsey in 2012 to launch e-commerce portal Jabong.com, which was sold to SoftBank-backed (now Walmart-owned) rival Flipkart for $70 million in 2016. By then, Jain had already moved on to <a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/Jabong%E2%80%99s-former-MD-switches-attention-to-wearable-smart-devices/article20718785.ece#">start a short-lived wearables company</a>. In 2014, he became Xiaomi India’s first hire, recruited by Hugo Barra, the former Android executive who had been tasked with expanding Xiaomi outside China.</p>



<p>At the time, the market was dominated by Samsung and by Indian brands, such as Micromax, Karbonn, and Lava, whose model was to import unbranded Chinese products and sell them as their own. “There was no R&amp;D team, no product team, and no product design. They would basically just buy those products and sell them here,” says Jain.</p>



<p>Xiaomi’s entry was not just about cutting out the middleman. In China, Xiaomi, along with Oppo and Vivo, had evolved beyond their origins in cheap but unreliable products and were now designing and producing higher-quality but affordable devices that were well adapted to a market like India, where disposable income was increasing in step with demand for mobile data.</p>



<p>Jain began his tenure at Xiaomi with a big gamble. In 2014, only 6% of Indian retail sales happened through e-commerce, but Jain launched Xiaomi as an online-only brand, replicating an approach that had worked in China.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Most people said, You are going to fail. You are going to be a disaster,” he said during a 2017 TED Talk. “Most smartphone brands until then focused on building large distribution networks, and we didn’t do that.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>To drum up interest, the company organized flash sales and made sure the phones sold out quickly, to enhance their perceived popularity, a technique known as “hunger marketing.” They spent relatively little on advertising, instead relying on their users to become evangelists for the brand.</p>



<p>Xiaomi’s phones seemed to hit a sweet spot of pricing and specifications. “Their phones were undercutting basically every other device on the market by half,” says Harish Jonalaggada, Asia editor at mobile review portal Android Central. The company launched phones for $180, with high specs like 64GB storage and 4GB RAM that were previously seen on only devices over $400.</p>



<p>The rush of orders for the launch of the Mi 3 model crashed the Indian e-commerce website Flipkart in the summer of 2014.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Xiaomi’s success wasn’t just about its hardware. Under Jain’s leadership, the company tailored its Android-based operating system, MIUI, to the local market. One feature, Smart SMS, identifies the cluttered text messages that Indian Railways sends to its customers and extracts booking information, turning it into a ticket-like document. Xiaomi was the first company in India to incorporate a popular “dual app” feature that allows users to run duplicate versions of the same app — such as WhatsApp — on the same phone.</p>



<p>As online channels exploded in popularity and started to become saturated, Xiaomi shifted direction. In 2017, the company dramatically expanded its physical retail presence, pushing deep into rural areas. In October 2018, it set a mark recognized by the Guinness World Records by opening <a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/xiaomi-opens-over-500-retail-stores-in-a-single-day-in-rural-india-1950375">500 stores</a> in a day. “One of the reasons Xiaomi has done well is — from both a product perspective and channel perspective — they made decisions unique to the India market,” says a Shanghai-based financial analyst covering Xiaomi who requested to remain anonymous, citing geopolitical tensions. In September, Xiaomi piloted its unique <a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/xiaomi-mi-store-on-wheels-mobile-stores-moving-trucks-launch-india-villages-watch-xiaomi-2298745">Mi Store on Wheels</a>, a van that sells everything from trimmers to phones throughout the hinterlands of India.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This sensitivity to the local market is in no small part due to the unusual autonomy that Jain has had in running Xiaomi in India. The Indian operations of Oppo and Vivo are both run by Chinese nationals. “Chinese companies are often very inward-looking and wouldn’t devolve the power in the same way Xiaomi has,” the analyst says.</p>

<p>That unusual autonomy stems from the relationship that Jain has built with Lei Jun, Xiaomi’s founder and CEO, a self-confessed acolyte of Apple founder Steve Jobs. Jain says that, when he and Jun first met, “both of us were wearing black T-shirts and denim jeans. It was cool.”</p>



<p>One former employee, who worked closely with Jain while setting up the India operations, told <em>Rest of World</em>: “Over a period of time when Xiaomi India was growing, Manu was able to earn Jun’s trust, which is actually very hard. … Manu’s bets on the Indian market proved him right. And so, after a while, the CEO decided to just let Manu make his own decisions, which is very rare.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>By 2019, Xiaomi was the largest smartphone brand in India, shifting 100 million units, according to data from the International Data Corporation. The company has expanded beyond mobile and offers everything from luggage to beard trimmers. Its rise came at the cost of Indian brands, whose market share fell from close to 50% to just 13% by the end of 2018, according to market intelligence firm Counterpoint Research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jun and Jain share a love of the limelight. Jun is a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/05/business/global/in-china-an-empire-built-by-aping-apple.html">social media celebrity</a> in China, posting mobile teasers and specifications to his 5 million …</p></div></div>

  <p>Although governed by simple physical laws, power grids are among the most complex human-made systems.
The main source of the complexity is the large number of components of the power systems that interact with each other: one needs to maintain a balance between power injections and withdrawals while satisfying certain physical, economic, and environmental conditions.
For instance, a central task of daily planning and operations of electricity grid operators<sup id="fnref:Tong04" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Tong04">1</a></sup> is to dispatch generation in order to meet demand at minimum cost, while respecting reliability and security constraints.
These tasks require solving a challenging constrained optimization problem, often referred to as some form of optimal power flow (OPF).<sup id="fnref:Cain12" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Cain12">2</a></sup></p>

<div><p>In a series of two blog posts, we are going to discuss the basics of power flow and optimal power flow problems.
In this first post, we focus on the most important component of OPF: the power flow (PF) equations.
For this, first we introduce some basic definitions of power grids and AC circuits, then we define the power flow problem.
</p></div>

<p><img src="https://invenia.github.io/blog/public/images/us_power_grid.jpg" alt="us_power_grid">

<h2 id="power-grids-as-graphs">Power grids as graphs</h2>

<p>Power grids are networks that include two main components: buses that represent important locations of the grid (e.g. generation points, load points, substations) and transmission (or distribution) lines that connect these buses.
It is pretty straightforward, therefore, to look at power grid networks as graphs: buses and transmission lines can be represented by nodes and edges of a corresponding graph.
There are two equivalent graph models that can be used to derive the basic power flow equations<sup id="fnref:Low14" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Low14">3</a></sup>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>directed graph representation (left panel of Figure 2): \(\mathbb{G}_{D}(\mathcal{N}, \mathcal{E})\);</li>
  <li>undirected graph representation (right panel of Figure 2): \(\mathbb{G}_{U}(\mathcal{N}, \mathcal{E} \cup \mathcal{E}^{R})\),</li>
</ul>

<div><p>where \(\mathcal{N}\), \(\mathcal{E} \subseteq \mathcal{N} \times \mathcal{N}\) and \(\mathcal{E}^{R} \subseteq \mathcal{N} \times \mathcal{N}\) denote the set of nodes (buses), and the forward and reverse orientations of directed edges (branches) of the graph, respectively.
</p></div>

<h2 id="complex-power-in-ac-circuits">Complex power in AC circuits</h2>

<p>Power can be transmitted more efficiently at high voltages as high <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage">voltage</a> (or equivalently, low <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current">current</a>) reduces the loss of power due to its dissipation on transmission lines.
Power grids generally use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current">alternating current</a> (AC) since the AC voltage can be altered (from high to low) easily via transformers.
Therefore, we start with some notation and definitions for AC circuits.</p>

<p>The most important characteristics of AC circuits is that, unlike in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_current">direct current</a> (DC) circuits, the currents and voltages are not constant in time: both their <em>magnitude</em> and <em>direction</em> vary periodically.
Because of several technical reasons (like low losses and disturbances), power generators use sinusoidal alternating quantities that can be straightforwardly modeled by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number%7D%7Bcomplex%20numbers">complex numbers</a>.</p>

<p>We will consistently use capital and small letters to denote complex and real-valued quantities, respectively.
For instance, let us consider two buses, \(i, j \in \mathcal{N}\), that are directly connected by a transmission line \((i, j) \in \mathcal{E}\).
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power">complex power</a> flowing from bus \(i\) to bus \(j\) is denoted by \(S_{ij}\) and it can be decomposed into its active (\(p_{ij}\)) and reactive (\(q_{ij}\)) components:</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
S_{ij} = p_{ij} + \mathrm{j}q_{ij},
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>where \(\mathrm{j} = \sqrt{-1}\).
The complex power flow can be expressed as the product of the complex voltage at bus \(i\), \(V_{i}\) and the complex conjugate of the current flowing between the buses, \(I_{ij}^{*}\):</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
S_{ij} = V_{i}I_{ij}^{*},
\label{power_flow}
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>It is well known that transmission lines have power losses due to their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance">resistance</a> (\(r_{ij}\)), which is a measure of the opposition to the flow of the current.
For AC-circuits, a dynamic effect caused by the line <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_reactance">reactance</a> (\(x_{ij}\)) also plays a role.
Unlike resistance, reactance does not cause any loss of power but has a delayed effect by storing and later returning power to the circuit.
The effect of resistance and reactance together can be represented by a single complex quantity, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance">impedance</a>: \(Z_{ij} = r_{ij} + \mathrm{j}x_{ij}\). 
Another useful complex quantity is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admittance">admittance</a>, which is the reciprocal of the impedance: \(Y_{ij} = \frac{1}{Z_{ij}}\).
Similarly to the impedance, the admittance can be also decomposed into its real, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance">conductance</a> (\(g_{ij}\)), and imaginary, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptance">susceptance</a> (\(b_{ij}\)), components: \(Y_{ij} = g_{ij} + \mathrm{j}b_{ij}\).</p>

<p>Therefore, the current can be written as a function of the line voltage drop and the admittance between the two buses, which is an alternative form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm%27s_law">Ohm’s law</a>:</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
I_{ij} = Y_{ij}(V_{i} - V_{j}).
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>Replacing the above expression for the current in the power flow equation (eq. \(\ref{power_flow}\)), we get</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
S_{ij} = Y_{ij}^{*}V_{i}V_{i}^{*} - Y_{ij}^{*}V_{i}V_{j}^{*} = Y_{ij}^{*} \left( |V_{i}|^{2} - V_{i}V_{j}^{*} \right).
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>The above power flow equation can be expressed by using the polar form of voltage, i.e. \(V_{i} = v_{i}e^{\mathrm{j} \delta_{i}} = v_{i}(\cos\delta_{i} + \mathrm{j}\sin\delta_{i})\) (where \(v_{i}\) and \(\delta_{i}\) are the voltage magnitude and angle of bus \(i\), respectively), and the admittance components:</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
S_{ij} = \left(g_{ij} - \mathrm{j}b_{ij}\right) \left(v_{i}^{2} - v_{i}v_{j}\left(\cos\delta_{ij} + \mathrm{j}\sin\delta_{ij}\right)\right),
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>where for brevity we introduced the voltage angle difference \(\delta_{ij} = \delta_{i} - \delta_{j}\).
Similarly, using a simple algebraic identity of \(g_{ij} - \mathrm{j}b_{ij} = \frac{g_{ij}^{2} + b_{ij}^{2}}{g_{ij} + \mathrm{j}b_{ij}} = \frac{|Y_{ij}|^{2}}{Y_{ij}} = \frac{Z_{ij}}{|Z_{ij}|^{2}} = \frac{r_{ij} + \mathrm{j}x_{ij}}{r_{ij}^{2} + x_{ij}^{2}}\), the impedance components-based expression has the following form:</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
    S_{ij} = \frac{r_{ij} + \mathrm{j}x_{ij}}{r_{ij}^{2} + x_{ij}^{2}} \left( v_{i}^{2} - v_{i}v_{j}\left(\cos\delta_{ij} + \mathrm{j}\sin\delta_{ij}\right)\right).
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>Finally, the corresponding real equations can be written as</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
\left\{
    \begin{aligned}
        p_{ij} &amp; = g_{ij} \left( v_{i}^{2} - v_{i} v_{j} \cos\delta_{ij} \right) - b_{ij} \left( v_{i} v_{j} \sin\delta_{ij} \right) \\
        q_{ij} &amp; = b_{ij} \left( -v_{i}^{2} + v_{i} v_{j} \cos\delta_{ij} \right) - g_{ij} \left( v_{i} v_{j} \sin\delta_{ij} \right), \\
    \end{aligned}
\right.
\label{power_flow_y}
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>and</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
\left\{
    \begin{aligned}
        p_{ij} &amp; = \frac{1}{r_{ij}^{2} + x_{ij}^{2}} \left[ r_{ij} \left( v_{i}^{2} - v_{i} v_{j} \cos\delta_{ij} \right) + x_{ij} \left( v_{i} v_{j} \sin\delta_{ij} \right) \right] \\
        q_{ij} &amp; = \frac{1}{r_{ij}^{2} + x_{ij}^{2}} \left[ x_{ij} \left( v_{i}^{2} - v_{i} v_{j} \cos\delta_{ij} \right) + r_{ij} \left( v_{i} v_{j} \sin\delta_{ij} \right) \right]. \\
    \end{aligned}
\right.
\label{power_flow_z}
\end{equation}\]

</p><h2 id="power-flow-models">Power flow models</h2>

<p>In the previous section we presented the power flow between two connected buses and established a relationship between complex power flow and complex voltages.
In power flow problems, the entire power grid is considered and the task is to calculate certain quantities based on some other specified ones.
There are two equivalent power flow models depending on the graph model used: the bus injection model (based on the undirected graph representation) and the branch flow model (based on the directed graph representation).
First, we introduce the basic formulations.
Then, we show the most widely used technique to solve power flow problems.
Finally, we extend the basic equations and derive more sophisticated models including additional components for real power grids.</p>

<h3 id="bus-injection-model">Bus injection model</h3>

<p>The bus injection model (BIM) uses the undirected graph model of the power grid, \(\mathbb{G}_{U}\).
For each bus \(i\), we denote by \(\mathcal{N}_{i} \subset \mathcal{N}\) the set of buses directly connected to bus \(i\).
Also, for each bus we introduce the following quantities<sup id="fnref:Low14:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Low14">3</a></sup><sup id="fnref:Wood14" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Wood14">4</a></sup> (Figure 3):</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(S_{i}^{\mathrm{gen}}\): generated power flowing into bus \(i\).</li>
  <li>\(S_{i}^{\mathrm{load}}\): demand power or load flowing out of the bus \(i\).</li>
  <li>\(S_{i}\): net power injection at bus \(i\), i.e. \(S_{i} = S_{i}^{\mathrm{gen}} - S_{i}^{\mathrm{load}}\).</li>
  <li>\(S_{i}^{\mathrm{trans}}\): transmitted power flowing between bus \(i\) and its adjacent buses.
</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://invenia.github.io/blog/public/images/power_quantities.png" alt="...">
Figure 3. Power balance and quantities of a bus connected to three adjacent buses and including a single generator and a single load.</p>

<p><br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tellegen/%27s_theorem">Tellegen’s theorem</a> establishes a simple relationship between these power quantities:</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
S_{i} = S_{i}^{\mathrm{gen}} - S_{i}^{\mathrm{load}} = S_{i}^{\mathrm{trans}} \ \ \ \ \forall i \in \mathcal{N}.
\label{power_balance}
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>Eq. \(\ref{power_balance}\) expresses the law of conservation of power (energy): the power injected (\(S_{i}^{\mathrm{gen}}\)) to bus \(i\) must be equal to the power going out from the bus, i.e. the sum of the withdrawn (\(S_{i}^{\mathrm{load}}\)) and transmitted power (\(S_{i}^{\mathrm{trans}}\)).
In the most basic model, a bus can represent either a generator (i.e. \(S_{i} = S_{i}^{\mathrm{gen}}\)) or a load (i.e. \(S_{i} = -S_{i}^{\mathrm{load}}\)).
For a given bus, the transmitted power can be obtained simply as a sum of the powers flowing in to and out from the bus, \(S_{i}^{\mathrm{trans}} = \sum \limits_{j \in …</p></div></div></div>

<p>This is the fourth incarnation of the mannequin figure. The first one was implemented
in Elica. The second one was implemented in C/C++ and OpenGL. The third one
was implemented in JS/Three.js and is a direct predecessor of the current mannequin.js.
Since its first incarnation, mannequin.js is used in the course <em>Fundamentals of Computer Graphics</em> for Computer Sciences undergraduate students from the
<a href="https://www.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/en">Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics</a>
at <a href="https://www.uni-sofia.bg/index.php/eng">Sofia University</a>.</p>

<p>Mannequin.js is licensed under <strong>GPL-3.0</strong>.</p>

<p>Three.js is included in this repository to safeguard against incompatibilities with future versions. Three.js is not a part of mannequin.js.</p>



<p>The <strong>mannequin.js</strong> library is provided as a JavaScript file that has to
be include along with three.js.</p>

<h3 id="minimal-program">Minimal program</h3>

<p>Here is a minimal program that creates a male figure in the browser (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-minimal.html">live example</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;html&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;head&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;script</span> <span>src=</span><span>"three.min.js"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;script</span> <span>src=</span><span>"mannequin.min.js"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/head&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;body&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;script&gt;</span>
      createScene();
      var man = new Male();
    <span>&lt;/script&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The helper function <code>createScene()</code> provides a default set-up of the scene and its elements, like lighting, camera, ground, etc. Another helper function, <code>animate(t)</code> is responsible for defining figures’ postures at moment <em>t</em>. If the set-up is done with a custom function, then it should also manage the animation loop by itself.</p>

<h3 id="figure-types">Figure types</h3>

<p>Mannequin figures are created as instances of classes <code>Male()</code>, <code>Female()</code> or <code>Child()</code> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-figure-types.html">live example</a>):</p>

<p><a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-figure-types.html"><img src="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/snapshots/example-figure-types.jpg"></a></p>

<p>These three classes have a common predecessor – the class <code>Mannequin(feminine,height)</code>, where <em>feminine</em> is boolean and defines whether the shape is feminine or masculine, and the second parameter is a number for relative height (adults have height 1).</p>



<p>All types of figures have the same structure of joints. For example, the right arm of a figure is accessed by <code>r_arm</code>. Left and right body parts are in respect to the figure, not to the viewer (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-body-parts.html">live example</a>):</p>

<p><a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-body-parts.html"><img src="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/snapshots/example-body-parts.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Each body part has rotation methods that turn it around a pivot point.
The first parameter <em>angle</em> of the methods is the angle of rotation in degrees,
so 180 is half turn and 360 is full turn. Negative angles are allowed and
they represent turning in the opposite direction. Some methods have an optional
second parameter for <em>direction</em> of motion, which could be the constant <code>LEFT</code> or
<code>RIGHT</code>.</p>

<h3 id="central-body-parts">Central body parts</h3>

<p>The central body parts are the ones which have single instances - <em>head</em>, <em>neck</em>, <em>torso</em>, <em>pelvis</em> and the body as a whole. To move the whole <strong>body</strong> use methods <em>bend</em>, <em>turn</em> and <em>tilt</em> of the figure (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-body.html">live example</a>):</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.bend ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.turn ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.turn ( angle, direction )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.tilt ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.tilt ( angle, direction )</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>head</strong> supports similar methods: <em>nod</em>, <em>turn</em> and <em>tilt</em> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-head.html">live example</a>):</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.head.nod ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.head.turn ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.head.turn ( angle, dir )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.head.tilt ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.head.tilt ( angle, dir )</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>torso</strong> has the same methods as the whole body: <em>bend</em>, <em>turn</em> and <em>tilt</em> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-torso.html">live example</a>):</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.torso.bend ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.torso.turn ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.torso.turn ( angle, direction )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.torso.tilt ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.torso.tilt ( angle, direction )</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Although the <strong>neck</strong> is a separate part of the body, it is not controlled individually. Instead, a part of the head motion is distributed over the neck. Similarly, the <strong>pelvis</strong> is not controlled individually. Instead, the whole body is controlled by bending, turning and tilting.</p>

<h3 id="upper-limbs">Upper limbs</h3>

<p>The upper limbs are symmetrical body parts: <em>arm</em>, <em>elbow</em>, <em>wrist</em> and <em>fingers</em>.</p>

<p>Both <strong>arms</strong> support methods <em>raise</em>, <em>straddle</em> and <em>turn</em> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-arm1.html">live example</a>). The following list refers to the right arm, however, the same methods are available for the right hand:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.r_arm.raise ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_arm.straddle ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_arm.straddle ( angle, direction )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_arm.turn ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_arm.turn ( angle, direction )</code></li>
</ul>

<p>If the <em>direction</em> parameter is omitted, then the default motions of <em>straddle</em> and <em>turn</em> are symmetrical. For example, the left arm is straddled to the left, while the right arm is straddled to the right (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-arm2.html">live example</a>).</p>

<p>The motion of the <strong>elbow</strong> is only <em>bend</em> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-elbow.html">live example</a>). Negative values for <em>angle</em> result in unnatural elbow position.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.r_elbow.bend ( angle )</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>wrists</strong> have the same methods as the torso: <em>bend</em>, <em>turn</em> and <em>tilt</em> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-wrist.html">live example</a>), but similar to the arms, the directions are symmetrical, if <em>direction</em> is not set:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.r_wrist.bend ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_wrist.turn ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_wrist.turn ( angle, direction )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_wrist.tilt ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_wrist.tilt ( angle, direction )</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The last body parts of the upper limbs are the <strong>fingers</strong>. They can only <em>bend</em> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-fingers.html">live example</a>), however, they are composed of two segments and the bending angle is distributed over both of them.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.r_fingers.bend ( angle )</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lower-limbs">Lower limbs</h3>

<p>The lower limbs are symmetrical body parts: <em>leg</em>, <em>knee</em> and <em>ankle</em>.</p>

<p>Both <strong>legs</strong> support methods <em>raise</em>, <em>straddle</em> and <em>turn</em> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-leg.html">live example</a>). Straddling and turning are symmetrical if <em>direction</em> is not set.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.r_leg.raise ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_leg.straddle ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_leg.straddle ( angle, direction )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_leg.turn ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_leg.turn ( angle, direction )</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The motion of the <strong>knee</strong> is only <em>bend</em> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-knee.html">live example</a>). Negative values for <em>angle</em> result in unnatural knee position.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.r_knee.bend ( angle )</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>ankles</strong> have the same methods as the wrists: <em>bend</em>, <em>turn</em> and <em>tilt</em> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-ankle.html">live example</a>), but similar to the legs, the directions are symmetrical, if <em>direction</em> is not set:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.r_ankle.bend ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_ankle.turn ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_ankle.turn ( angle, direction )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_ankle.tilt ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_ankle.tilt ( angle, direction )</code></li>
</ul>



<p>The posture of a figure is defined by a setting the rotations of body parts. The order of rotations is fixed independent on the order of rotations in the user program (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-order.html">live example</a>). For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>figure</span><span>.</span><span>head</span><span>.</span><span>nod</span><span>(</span><span>30</span><span>);</span>
<span>figure</span><span>.</span><span>head</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>45</span><span>);</span>
<span>figure</span><span>.</span><span>head</span><span>.</span><span>tilt</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>,</span><span>RIGHT</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>produces the same posture as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>figure</span><span>.</span><span>head</span><span>.</span><span>tilt</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>,</span><span>RIGHT</span><span>);</span>
<span>figure</span><span>.</span><span>head</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>45</span><span>);</span>
<span>figure</span><span>.</span><span>head</span><span>.</span><span>nod</span><span>(</span><span>30</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Sometimes this might lead to unexpected results, especially if the user assumes an order of rotations that is different from what mannequin.js uses. This might happen when a body part is rotated around 3 or 2 axes.</p>

<h3 id="static-posture">Static posture</h3>

<p>The static posture defines the position of body part that do not change. By default, when a figure is created, its body parts are set to the default posture. This version of mannequin.js does not provide posture editor, so all rotations has to be defined programmatically.</p>

<p><a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-posture.html"><img src="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/snapshots/example-posture.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Sometimes it is better to define the figure step by step. Tai Chi Chuan posture (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-posture.html">live example</a>) could start by defining the whole body position:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// overall body position</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>7.7</span><span>;</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>tilt</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>,</span><span>LEFT</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>15</span><span>);</span>

<span>// torso and head</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>torso</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>30</span><span>,</span><span>RIGHT</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>torso</span><span>.</span><span>tilt</span><span>(</span><span>15</span><span>,</span><span>RIGHT</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>torso</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>15</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>head</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>70</span><span>,</span><span>RIGHT</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then the orientation of the legs can be set:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// right leg</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_leg</span><span>.</span><span>raise</span><span>(</span><span>85</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_leg</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_leg</span><span>.</span><span>straddle</span><span>(</span><span>40</span><span>,</span><span>LEFT</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_knee</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>90</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_ankle</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>35</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_ankle</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>,</span><span>RIGHT</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_ankle</span><span>.</span><span>tilt</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>15</span><span>);</span>

<span>// left leg</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>l_leg</span><span>.</span><span>raise</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>30</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>l_knee</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>25</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>l_ankle</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>42</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, the arms are fixed:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// left arm</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>l_arm</span><span>.</span><span>raise</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>l_arm</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>40</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>l_arm</span><span>.</span><span>tilt</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>60</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>l_elbow</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>155</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>l_wrist</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>50</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>l_fingers</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>10</span><span>);</span>

<span>// right arm</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_arm</span><span>.</span><span>raise</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>10</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_arm</span><span>.</span><span>tilt</span><span>(</span><span>70</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_arm</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_elbow</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>40</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_wrist</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>30</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_fingers</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>90</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="dynamic-posture">Dynamic posture</h3>

<p>The dynamic posture – i.e. a posture that changes over time – is set with the same methods that are used for static posture. Mannequin.js defines an empty function <code>animate(t)</code>, which is called in the animation loop once for each frame. All changes of a posture should be defined inside this function (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-dynamic.html">live example</a>). The parameter <em>t</em> is the time, measured in tenths of seconds. This function is set up in <code>createScene()</code>. If <em>createScene</em> and <em>animate</em> are not used, then the animation loop should be managed manually.</p>

<p><a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-dynamic.html"><img src="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/snapshots/example-dynamic.jpg"></a></p>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To make the animation loop faster, all constant rotations should be defined outside <em>animate</em>. Also, if a rotation changing in the loop, there is no need to set it up outside the loop.</p>



<p>Apart for moving body parts, the current version of mannequin.js provides basic functionality for additional modification or accessing the figure.</p>

<h3 id="custom-colors">Custom colors</h3>

<p>By default, all figures use a predefined set of global colors for body parts. Global colors are stored in <code>Mannequin.colors</code> array as six <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/math/Color">Three.js colors</a> or lowercase <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp">HTML/CSS color names</a> in specific order – head, shoes, pelvis, joints, limbs and torso:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you spend a lot of time on Hacker News, it’s easy to get taken by the allure of building a web app without a framework. There are a bunch of potential advantages (no bloat! bespoke to your project!) and being able to say you built something with minimal dependencies gets you Engineer Points.</p>
<p>That is, if you can pull it off.</p>
<p>I started a new side project recently. It’s a web-based graphics editor, so it needs to be a single page app. My time spent profiling <a href="https://songrender.com/">SongRender</a> for performance issues has made me a little wary of React for building interfaces that update at 60 frames per second, so I decided to avoid it. I’d go (mostly) vanilla and see how far that took me.</p>
<p>I installed <a href="https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/">lit-html</a> and got to work. “Components” were simply functions that returned lit-html template results. A big singleton at the top of the tree held onto all the application state, stored as a global variable within that module.</p>
<p>The first hurdle came when a component needed local state. I could have lifted it to the singleton, but that would have broken the component’s encapsulation. I noticed that lit-html directives can keep state, so I decided to use them to build a tiny component library — ignoring a warning from the lit-html developers that this wasn’t a supported use case.</p>
<p>My home-brewed library worked great… until I needed to run some code when a component appeared on the screen. I started digging through lit-html documentation and issues looking for a way to detect a directive’s lifecycle, but it became clear to me that going down that path would be painful.</p>
<p>At that point, I recalled <a href="https://tomdale.net/2015/11/javascript-frameworks-and-mobile-performance/">this quote by Tom Dale</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have heard from many developers who have told me that they accepted the argument that vanilla JavaScript or microlibraries would let them write leaner, meaner, faster apps. After a year or two, however, what they found themselves with was a slower, bigger, less documented and unmaintained in-house framework with no community. As apps grow, you tend to need the abstractions that a framework offers. Either you or the community write the code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fair enough. Let’s avoid that trap. What about a small framework? I’d heard a lot of good things about Svelte, and although I was slightly worried about the size of the Svelte community I figured it would be fine.</p>
<p>My migration attempt quickly ground to a halt when I wanted a parent component to apply some styles to a child component. In React, I’d pass a class name in from the parent as a <code>className</code> prop. In Svelte, that’s considered a workaround, and the actual feature is the subject of an <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0000-style-properties.md">RFC</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Maybe this is an example of <a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/160.html">dangling by a trivial feature</a>. But it’s so basic a capability that I’m surprised Svelte is on version three without an officially blessed way to do it. I ran into this limitation when I created my <strong>second component</strong>. Way before I got to try out any of the cool reactivity that earns Svelte all that buzz.</p>
<p>So I changed my mind and went with React. After an hour or so, I’d finished moving everything over — and my anxiety had vanished. I stopped worrying about having most efficient component system, and picked up work on the thing I wanted to build in the first place.</p>
<p>No, React isn’t perfect. It’s optimized for apps that make network requests and then display lists of things (i.e. most apps) which isn’t really what I’m doing here<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. The performance is fine now, although I expect I’ll have to optimize as my project gets more complex.</p>
<p>But React lets me stop thinking about the framework. React gets out of my way. React is <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">boring</a>. React is actively developed. React has a giant ecosystem and a giant community. React is battle-tested on some of the most visited websites in the world.</p>
<p>I’m sure there are technically better ways to build a highly interactive interface on the web, but life is too short for me to spend hours trying to figure them out. There are things I want to create, and the only way I can actually create them is to stop spending so much time on tooling.</p>
<p>For now, I’m choosing React.</p>

<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>The solution they seem to have landed on — letting the child expose CSS custom properties as props — is actually pretty cool, though I don’t like that Svelte will silently wrap your component with an extra <code>div</code>. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

<h3>TL;DR</h3>
<p><span><p>Predicting protein folding is a massive problem with huge potential to help us understand disease. It’s been stuck in a rut for the past 50 years, but one team of researchers has come out of nowhere and claims to have solved the problem. But have they?</p></span>
</p></div>
<h3 grey-text="" text-darken-4="">Clinical Need</h3>
<section>
<div>
<p><span>
<div><p>Proteins are made up of amino acids. Getting the amino acid sequence for a protein is pretty easy these days. But going from this sequence to the 3-dimensional shape of the protein is really hard.</p><p>For decades, researchers have worked out protein structures using slow and expensive techniques such as <sample>x-ray crystallography</sample>. So far we’ve only solved about 170,000 proteins using these approaches. Yet more than 200 million proteins have been discovered across all forms of life 😳</p><p>Being able to predict a protein’s shape based on its amino acid sequence would be a game changer. We could design drugs faster by targeting proteins more effectively. But computer-based predictions haven’t been accurate enough to be useful. Until now…</p></div>
</span>
</p>
<div>

<p>X-ray crystallography uses the diffraction of x-rays to work out the shape of a protein. The pictures are murky and there's a lot of guesswork involved!</p>

</p>

</div>
</div>
</section>
<h3 grey-text="" text-darken-4="">What did they do?</h3>
<div><p>The team created a deep learning pipeline for predicting protein shape from its amino acid sequence.</p><p>They entered this neural network into the “Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction” (CASP) competition. Teams are given amino acids sequences for ~100 proteins with unknown structures and asked to predict protein shape. The predictions are given a score from 0-100. Slow techniques (like x-ray crystallography) score above 90.</p></div>
<h3 grey-text="" text-darken-4="">How did the model work?</h3>
<section>
<div>
<p><span>
<div><p>The first version of their model (AlphaFold) performs the following stages:</p><p>First, it looks for similar sequence fragments to the protein of interest from a large protein sequence database. This helps identify features of the protein at interest. An <sample>autoencoder</sample> predicts which protein shape the sequence fragment most likely represents.</p><p>These features are then fed into a convolutional neural network which predicts the distances between different parts of the protein sequence. Predicting distances enables it to also predict contact points.</p><p>Then, using the predicted distances and contact points, the model considers all the possible shapes of the protein and identifies the most likely one.</p></div>
</span>
</p>
<div>

<p>This is a type of neural network that compresses data into a bottleneck of it's most important features, and measures it's performance by reconstructing that bottleneck back up to size. It's an in depth topic worth <a href="https://www.jeremyjordan.me/autoencoders/#:~:text=Autoencoders%20are%20an%20unsupervised%20learning,representation%20of%20the%20original%20input.">reading more on</a></p>

<div>
<p><span>
<p>With the updated model (AlphaFold-2) they made some changes. They haven't released a paper yet (only an abstract), but from what we can tell they used an <sample>attention-based deep learning</sample> to fit over the whole shape of the protein, not just the fragments.</p>
</span>
</p>
<div>

<p>Instead of working over the whole sequence at once, this method allows the learning to 'attend' to subsections individually. This is a bit like trying to translate a long german word- instead of trying to decode the whole word, you break it into sub-words and see how they match, then put it all together.</p>

<h3 grey-text="" text-darken-4="">How did the model perform?</h3>
<div><p><img alt="Animated Protein" height="450" src="https://explainthispaper.s3.amazonaws.com/images/protein.width-800.png" width="800"></p><p>From the start of the competition in 1994 up to 2016, CASP scores had been around 40. The first time DeepMind entered, they scored up to 60. This year- AlphaFold scored an average of 92.4, smashing the threshold of 90/100!</p><p>In fact, the organisers of the competition thought that DeepMind had been cheating, so they set them a special challenge- a membrane protein from an ancient species of <i>archaea</i>. For 10 years with no success, research teams tried every trick in the book to get an x-ray crystal structure of the protein.</p><p>AlphaFold had no problem, returning an image of a three part protein with two helical arms. In hindsight, this structure fit the x-ray crystallography data perfectly, effectively going beyond the limitations of current human research.</p></div>
<h3 grey-text="" text-darken-4="">So what?</h3>
<section>
<div>
<p><span>
<div><p>This is a thorny problem that researchers and pharmaceutical companies have been working on for 50+ years. This model could predict the shape of proteins without unreliable experimental measurements. This would mean faster development of a wide range of drugs, from cancer drugs that better target proteins for cell replication, to antibiotics that target surface receptors of microbes.</p><p>What’s more, this model was cheap to train- just weeks on quite a <sample>small cluster of servers</sample></p><p>It's worth saying that this isn't the whole picture of protein folding- this still doesn't inform how proteins change shape in the presence of other molecules (like oxygen near haemoglobin). These are also the crystallised protein forms rather than the true 'in vivo' structures, so there may be some errors in translation, but that remains to be seen.</p></div>
</span>
</p>
<div>

<p>Using Google's <a href="https://cloud.google.com/tpu/pricing#pricing_calculator">pricing calculator</a> and the details from the blog post, this could be trained for around $21,000. In the grand scheme of biology and pharmaceuticals, this is pennies!<br></p>

<p>Making a social media account with a pseudonym or artist/brand name is easy. And it’s enough is most use cases to protect your identity as the next George Orwell. There are plenty of people using pseudonyms all over Facebook/Instagram/Twitter/Linkedin/TikTok/Snapchat/Reddit/… But the vast majority of those are anything but anonymous and can easily be traced to their real identity by your local cops, random people within the OSINT<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> (Open-Source Intelligence) community and trolls<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> on 4chan<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This is a good thing as most criminals/trolls are not really tech savvy and will be identified with ease. But this is also a bad thing as most political dissidents, human rights activists and whistleblowers can also be tracked rather easily.</p>

<p>This updated guide aims to provide introduction to various tracking techniques, id verification techniques and guidance to creating and maintaining anonymous identities online including social media accounts safely.</p>

<p>Will this guide help you protect yourself from the NSA, the FSB, Mark Zuckerberg or the Mossad if they’re out to find you? Probably not … Mossad will be doing “Mossad things” <sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> and will probably find you no matter how hard to try to hide<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>You have to consider your threat model<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> before going further.</p>

<p>Will this guide help you protect your privacy from OSINT researchers like Belingcat<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup> , Doxing<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8">8</a></sup> trolls on 4chan<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9">9</a></sup> and others that have no access to the NSA toolbox? More likely. Tho I wouldn’t be so sure about 4chan.</p>

<p>It’s also important to understand this guide is the humble result of years of experience and testing from a single individual (myself) and that many of those systems that aim to prevent anonymity are opaque closed-source systems. Most of those guidelines are guessed based on experience. These experiences take a lot of time and resources and are unfortunately far from being scientific. <strong>Your mileage may vary.</strong></p>

<p>You might think this guide has no legitimate use but there are many<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10">10</a></sup><sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11">11</a></sup> such as:</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Journalism</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Activism</p>

<p>This guide is written for use by those good intended individuals who might not be knowledgeable enough to consider the big picture of online anonymity.</p>

<p>There are many ways you can be tracked besides browser cookies and ads, your e-mail and your phone number. And if you think only the Mossad or the NSA/FSB can find you, you would be terribly wrong.</p>

<p>Here is a non-exhaustive list of some of the many ways you can be de-anonymized:</p>

<h2 id="your-ip-address">Your IP address:</h2>

<p>Your IP address<sup id="fnref:17" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:17">17</a></sup> is the most known and obvious way you can be tracked. That IP is the IP you’re using at the source. This is where you connect to the internet. That IP is usually provided by your ISP (Internet Service Provider) (xDSL, Mobile, Cable, Fiber, Cafe, Bar, Friend, Neighbor). Most countries have data retention regulations<sup id="fnref:18" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:18">18</a></sup> which mandates keeping logs of who is using what IP at a certain time/date for up to several years or indefinitely. Your ISP can tell a third party that you were using a specific IP at a specific date and time, years after the fact. If that IP (the origin one) leaks at any point for any reason, it can be used to track down you directly. In many countries, you won’t be able to have internet access without providing some form of identification to the provider (address, ID, real name, e-mail …).</p>

<p>Useless to say that most platforms (such as social networks) will also keep (sometimes indefinitely) the IP addresses you used to sign-up but also those you used to sign-in.</p>

<p>For those reasons, we’ll need to not use that origin IP (the one tied to your identification) or hide it as much as we can through a combination of various means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Using a public WIFI service (free).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using an anonymous VPN service<sup id="fnref:19" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:19">19</a></sup> (paid by cash).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using the Tor Anonymity Network<sup id="fnref:20" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:20">20</a></sup> (free).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All those will be explained later in this guide.</p>

<h2 id="your-dns-requests">Your DNS requests:</h2>

<p>DNS stands for “Domain Name System”<sup id="fnref:21" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:21">21</a></sup> and is a service used by your browser (and other apps) to find the IP addresses of a service. It’s pretty much a huge “contact list” (phone book for older people) that works like asking it a name and it returns the number to call. Except it returns an IP instead.</p>

<p>Every time your browser wants to access a certain service such as Google through <a href="https://www.google.com/">https://www.google.com</a>. Your Browser (Chrome or Firefox) will query a DNS service to find the IP addresses of the Google web servers.</p>

<p>Usually the DNS service is provided by your ISP and automatically configured by the network you’re connecting to. This DNS service could also be subject to data retention regulations or will just keep logs for other reasons (data collection for advertising purposes for instance). Therefore this ISP will be capable of …</p></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A freelancer is at once the boss, the employee, and the finance manager. But there’s one thing no one likes dealing with: taxes. Even when you have <a href="https://pulseblueprint.com/careers/entrepreneurship/freelance-contract-clauses-every-freelancer-should-use/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iron-clad freelance contracts</a>, taxes can be a nuisance at best and overly complicated and time consuming at worst. One platform – Bonsai – is aiming to fix that.</p><p>Bonsai, a freelance business management platform boasting over 250,000 users, has just launched a new <a href="https://www.hellobonsai.com/self-employment-tax-calculator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">freelance tax calculator</a> for US-based freelancers. The calculator provides an estimate of how much tax you might end up owing based on: your state, filing status, income levels, and business expenses.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’ve freelanced for many years, and self-employment taxes were always an area of confusion,” said Bonsai’s Head of Marketing, Madhav Bhandari, in an interview with <a href="https://aithority.com/news/bonsais-freelance-tax-hub-is-free-and-public-for-everyone-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AIThority</a>.</p><figure><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/GmMCVhDxoFe_WEDJKuqqQlyvamAdCBjYwS4px3EgcdElItJpY46cLhNS-KdaTeNsJnEoJUsxNBWbOj2e25DYV_Bg9jsXykP2RHCyoX0y8It2zxtXdG-Ah7YXoUQYgPqI7a7tEgBs" alt="Bonsai self employment tax calculator" data-old-src="//pulseblueprint.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif"><figcaption>Source: <em>Bonsai Freelance Tax Calculator</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Helping freelancers with self-employment taxes</h2><p>In most states – and most countries outside of the US – freelancers are lumped in with “self-employed individuals.” This means they have to register their businesses as self-employed and handle taxes as such. Thankfully, this means access to all the same deductions as small businesses. Unfortunately, the web of deductions is incredibly complex. What supports you can access depends on both your state and your city, as different municipalities offer different support.&nbsp;</p><p>One thing that every freelancer can leverage to reduce their tax bill, though, is business expenses. Whenever you spend money legitimately to run your business, you can deduct that expense against your taxes. This web can also get complicated, so Bonsai launched a <a href="https://www.hellobonsai.com/self-employment-tax-deductions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">library of common self-employment tax deductions</a>. At the top of the page, you’ll see a list of things that almost every freelancer can deduct. These range from set up expenses to ongoing subscriptions. At the bottom, you’ll see a list of types of freelancers – from makeup artists to software engineers – linking out to the common deductions for each type of work.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/b-2xmtEMndeM-ASxgzNaFRDiKLR2d42ctCJRXDJBXge_GUoFMEj8K3YzuiIRCnqtBy3yjNktGtXzYbF0kMqAdY0PZEZNaLb7Klvc-2-l5xmCDRGppf0Nik893Hq5-9BsRa4jVUIX" alt="image of Bonsai's tax deductions by career type" data-old-src="//pulseblueprint.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif"><figcaption>Source: <em>Bonsai Tax Deductions Information Hub</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Avoiding the pitfalls of freelancing</h2><p>According to one study, a common <a href="https://pulseblueprint.com/news/biggest-challenges-freelancers-face-skynova-study/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">challenge freelancers face</a> is not saving or withholding for taxes. Ideally, once you have a ballpark figure of how much tax you will need to pay, you can also begin to save so you don’t have a surprise bill.&nbsp;</p><p>Many of the other key challenges freelancers face revolve around payment. Freelancers say they have trouble ensuring on-time payment and many send invoices late or don’t have contracts before starting work. All of these challenges are also ones Bonsai says they can help with through their paid platform. However, you don’t want to pay for a platform to get this benefit. There are free ways to ensure clients pay on time, from <a href="https://pulseblueprint.com/careers/entrepreneurship/freelance-contract-clauses-every-freelancer-should-use/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">freelance contract clauses</a> to free platforms like <a href="https://www.waveapps.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wave</a>.</p><p>“As the year comes to an end and you start reflecting on 2020 and planning for 2021, we hope this gives freelancers some help and confidence in managing their finances,” said Bhandari.</p><h4><strong>Read Next</strong>: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://pulseblueprint.com/news/hawaii-remote-program-movers-and-shakas/" target="_blank">Hawaii Will Fly Remote Workers Over, With One Catch </a></h4></div></div>]]>

<p>Learning is a heavily misunderstood&nbsp;concept.</p>



<p>As a&nbsp;paradigm&nbsp;example of&nbsp;deep work,&nbsp;we understand that, when reading, directing your full attention to the material at hand is essential.&nbsp;Graspingcomplex information is hard.</p>



<p>But this is only half the battle.</p>



<p>After some string of words hits your retina and has made its way to your brain, you’re&nbsp;not done.</p>



<p>In a&nbsp;cruel&nbsp;irony,&nbsp;these hours of&nbsp;deep work&nbsp;often cause&nbsp;flow&nbsp;states&nbsp;and the feeling that ‘you’ve had a good day’ and learned a&nbsp;shitload&nbsp;of new stuff.</p>



<p>But for many reading&nbsp;episodes&nbsp;this feeling is&nbsp;deceptive.&nbsp;There is anineliminable&nbsp;aspect to learning that takes place&nbsp;<em>after&nbsp;</em>the&nbsp;glorious&nbsp;flow state.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;other half of the battle is&nbsp;to&nbsp;transfer the newly acquired intelligence from your working memory to your&nbsp;long-term&nbsp;understanding and&nbsp;integrate&nbsp;it into your standing stack of mental models.</p>



<p>If you don’t&nbsp;facilitate&nbsp;this, your learning&nbsp;gains&nbsp;are only a&nbsp;fraction&nbsp;of what they could have been.</p>



<p>In this article,&nbsp;I’m going to breakdown how to win the battle and the war — how to&nbsp;avoid&nbsp;these traps and organize your reading habit for a maximalReturn On Investment (ROI)&nbsp;on reading hours.</p>



<p>This is what we’ll cover:</p>

<h3 id="1b1d">Meta-Learning</h3>



<p>Meta-learning&nbsp;is knowing how to learn.&nbsp;It is one of the most important skills to learn, yet few people know how to do to it.</p>



<p>Reading and writing is what I do for a living, and, interestingly, a lot of non-imaginary&nbsp;friends have been asking me how I learn.&nbsp;This is special, becausemost of the times when people don’t know how to do something, they go&nbsp;togreat&nbsp;lengths&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>to notice their&nbsp;deficiency.</p>



<p>Could it be that many students turned ‘knowledge workers’ have the&nbsp;naggingfeeling that something is missing in their skillset because they were never taught&nbsp;meta-learning?</p>



<p>This is not their fault, but a&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/the-understanding-project/schools-dont-support-personal-development-they-distort-it-7e1c227eb01d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lack in our education system</a>.</p>



<p>As Adam Robinson observed on the&nbsp;<a href="https://fs.blog/adam-robinson-pt2/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><em>Farnam Street&nbsp;</em>podcast</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>“<strong>No one ever shows us how to learn, ever</strong>.&nbsp;Nowhere in school.&nbsp;For example, imagine, Shane, [Shane is the host of the FS podcast] in French class, French 101, your first French class, your teacher said,&nbsp;“Everyone, you’re going to have to learn a lot of vocabulary in this class so before I teach you any words I’m going to teach you a way to remember vocabulary.”&nbsp;They never do that.&nbsp;They just go, “We’re going to have a quiz on these 30 words on Monday.&nbsp;Good luck.”&nbsp;But they don’t teach us how to learn actually, or remember things.”</p></blockquote>



<p>This is&nbsp;weird, because,&nbsp;in today’s high-information world,&nbsp;people need the ability to&nbsp;<em>make sense of</em>&nbsp;complexity and to&nbsp;<em>combine</em>&nbsp;many bits of data into a broad picture of the world.</p>



<p>Merely&nbsp;<em>acquiring</em>information is&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>(yet) learning.</p>



<p>Learning itself is a skill, and knowing how to do it well is an incredibly valuable advantage.</p>



<p>We take this is for granted, but how to do this is&nbsp;far from&nbsp;obvious&nbsp;and doesn’t get taught in the curriculum.</p>



<hr>



<h3 id="1d70">Learning is a&nbsp;two-step&nbsp;process</h3>



<p>So, how do we learn?</p>



<p>Before we attempt to answer the question,&nbsp;let’s get clear&nbsp;on what a&nbsp;satisfactoryanswer needs to get us.&nbsp;What does it&nbsp;<em>mean&nbsp;</em>to learn?&nbsp;When have you learned something?</p>



<p>In the introduction, I stated that&nbsp;just studying the information isn’t enough(no matter how intense your focus was).&nbsp;Learning has&nbsp;two phases — not one.</p>



<ol><li>Read/listen&nbsp;the damn thing</li><li>Process and&nbsp;recall&nbsp;what you’ve just ‘learned’</li></ol>



<p>A lot has been said about the first phase — about deep work, concentration, blocking out&nbsp;distractions, and so&nbsp;forth.&nbsp;This makes sense:&nbsp;if you’re checking Facebook all the time,&nbsp;your mind is not ‘there’, and you might as well not have spent your afternoon ’reading’ this book.</p>



<p>This is all great and I‘m a big fan, but in the&nbsp;meantime, we’re ignoring step two.</p>



<p>If you don’t spend time revisiting and grappling with the book either,&nbsp;<em>the same applies</em> — you might as well not have read it.&nbsp;In the long run, there is no difference between skipping the first or the second stage (except whether you passed that French test in high school back in 2019…).</p>



<p>After you’ve killed Cersei, you’ve still got the&nbsp;White Walkers to deal with.&nbsp;If you don’t, you lose either way.</p>



<p>That is why students who&nbsp;binge-study&nbsp;the night before the exam quite literally forget everything two days later:&nbsp;while all these&nbsp;lame&nbsp;French words were still in their short-term memory,&nbsp;allowing them to pass the test,&nbsp;the information never&nbsp;transitioned&nbsp;to their long-term understanding — and so, sooner or later, it&nbsp;evaporated.</p>



<p>To learn,&nbsp;you need to transfer the newly acquired intelligence from&nbsp;your working memory to your long-term understanding.</p>



<p><strong>The jump from short-term memory to long-term understanding doesn’t happen automatically.</strong><strong>The default mode, after you close your books for the day, is not&nbsp;</strong><strong>retainment</strong><strong>&nbsp;but&nbsp;<em>forgetting</em></strong><strong>.</strong></p>



<p>This learning guide&nbsp;is not about&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/the-understanding-project/why-you-dont-need-to-read-those-productivity-guides-347fe02cc196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to do generic deep work</a>.&nbsp;It explains how to maximize the ROI on hours spent reading,&nbsp;<em>assuming</em>&nbsp;you did them ‘deep work style’.</p>



<h3 id="9181">Remembering the right&nbsp;things</h3>



<p>First, I need to discuss a common&nbsp;objection&nbsp;that denies phase two of learning matters.&nbsp;If you have no&nbsp;quibble&nbsp;with memorization, and doing the required effort, you can skip this section.</p>



<p>“But Mr. Maarten,” the protest goes, “you mention ‘processing’ and ‘remembering’ into my ‘long-term understanding’, but isn’t memorizing pointless?&nbsp;My Google Assistant can look everything up and also is smarter than me, says my Google Assistant.”</p>



<p>Indeed,&nbsp;Albert Einstein is&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/the-polymath-project/studying-history-is-more-important-than-ever-in-todays-economy-c99fde4be7d0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supposed</a>&nbsp;to have said:&nbsp;“Never&nbsp;memorize&nbsp;what you can look up in a book”.&nbsp;In Einstein’s days, books were&nbsp;unequaled&nbsp;as a source of information.&nbsp;We, on the other hand, live in an age where nearly everything can be accessed through the magic vehicle of internet.&nbsp;Following Einstein’s logic, then,&nbsp;<em>nothing&nbsp;</em>is worth memorizing anymore, because&nbsp;<em>everything</em>&nbsp;can be looked up.</p>



<p>But, of course, that is probably not what old Albert was getting at.</p>



<p>Most likely,&nbsp;the advice he wanted to&nbsp;dispense&nbsp;was that&nbsp;you should not waste your time by committing unimportant details to memory.&nbsp;Rather,&nbsp;your&nbsp;focus should be on understanding the bigger picture — on&nbsp;how things relate to each other.</p>



<p>This reminds me of Elon Musk’s&nbsp;approach to learning.&nbsp;He&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rgsan/i_am_elon_musk_ceocto_of_a_rocket_company_ama/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">recommends</a>viewing knowledge as a tree:</p>



<blockquote><p>Make sure you understand the fundamental principles, the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang on to.</p></blockquote>



<p>To ‘learn’, we need to do more than merely feeding ourselves new information.&nbsp;Expanding our intelligence requires&nbsp;<em>connecting</em>&nbsp;new materials to what we already knew&nbsp;(the second phase of learning).&nbsp;That, in turn, requires something to connect&nbsp;<em>to.</em></p>



<p>There’s no adding branches without a solid trunk.</p>



<p>The very possibility of genuine insight requires a memorized base.&nbsp;Without it, data you consume will not be added to your tree of knowledge.&nbsp;Instead, they will float in the air for a couple of weeks or so, before being taken away by the wind.</p>



<p>Knowledge, gone.&nbsp;Time, wasted.</p>



<p>What I’m saying is&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>that we should&nbsp;devise&nbsp;techniques which enable us torecite&nbsp;everything we’ve learned.&nbsp;That’s why we’re not talking about, for example,&nbsp;retaining&nbsp;the date of the French revolution.</p>



<p>However,&nbsp;you&nbsp;<em>should&nbsp;</em>learn by heart the lessons it tells you about how the world works&nbsp;and update your representation of reality&nbsp;accordingly.</p>



<p>In&nbsp;other words,&nbsp;you should use it to&nbsp;inform&nbsp;your&nbsp;unconscious — the&nbsp;sum&nbsp;of your mental models.</p>



<h3 id="7b89">Enter: Mental&nbsp;models</h3>



<p>I’ve long been skeptical about mental models since (1) they’re all the rage now and (2) no one seems to be able to explain in concrete terms what they are. A dangerous combination.</p>



<p>It turned out my doubt was due to ignorance on my part.</p>



<p>A mental model,&nbsp;as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_model" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>&nbsp;tells us, is</p>



<blockquote><p>An explanation of someone’s thought process about how something works in the real world.&nbsp;<strong>It is a representation of the surrounding world</strong>, the relationships between its various parts and a person’s intuitive perception about his or her own acts and their consequences.</p></blockquote>



<p>Every problem and situation is just another ‘one of those’ — another one of a certain type.&nbsp;Figuring out what type it is and reflecting on principles for handling that type of issue will help you do a better job.</p>



<p>On the conscious level, mental models allow us to ‘fit’ different possible interpretations onto reality to see if it is ‘one of those’.</p>



<p>For example,&nbsp;according to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Hanlon’s Razor</a>&nbsp;one should&nbsp;“never attribute tomalice&nbsp;that which is adequately explained by carelessness”.&nbsp;When your coworker hands you crappy slides for the presentation you have to give in five minutes — what’s going on here?</p>



<p>Which ‘one of those’ do we have here?</p>



<p>You can see&nbsp;how different mental models in our heads will cause us to reach different conclusions about the correct interpretation of the situation.</p>



<p>A mental model is a mental, simplified&nbsp;depiction&nbsp;of how something works.They are how we order complexity, why we consider some things more relevant than others, and how we reason.&nbsp;They help us filter, organize and understand.</p>



<p>For instance, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Pareto distribution</a>,&nbsp;“for many events,&nbsp;roughly 80% of the …</p></div></article></div>

This means that customers no longer have to choose between EKS (as a managed service) and some other Kubernetes setup. Instead, they can choose between EKS as a service managed by AWS or managed by themselves. The application hosted on top won’t observe any difference.</span></p><p><span>Being big fans of Kubernetes distributions, to the point where we open-sourced our own </span><a href="https://compliantkubernetes.io/"><span>Compliant Kubernetes</span></a><span>, we took EKS Distro for a spin.</span></p><p><span>For those unfamiliar with the term, a distribution is to Kubernetes just like a distribution is to Linux. As the saying goes, Kubernetes is a powerful engine, but you need to build a car around it. In other words, a Kubernetes distribution is Kubernetes with a chosen configuration and a chosen set of addons. For example, Kubernetes is </span><a href="https://searchitoperations.techtarget.com/news/252487963/Kubernetes-security-defaults-prompt-upstream-dilemma"><span>not secure by default, nor by itself</span></a><span>. Hence, a security-focused Kubernetes distribution will configure Kubernetes with restrictive PodSecurityPolicies and add intrusion detection addons.</span></p><p><span>Specifically, a Kubernetes distribution consists of three parts:</span></p><ol><li><span>A procedure — either code or documentation — to create </span><b>infrastructure</b><span> necessary for a Kubernetes cluster, such as virtual machines, load balancers, network security policies, DNS records, etc. The distribution may impose a certain base operating system (OS) image or may cater to a large variety of base images.</span></li><li><span>A procedure to </span><b>bootstrap</b><span> Kubernetes control plane components onto the control plane and worker nodes, in particular the apiserver, scheduler, kubelets and controller manager. Most distributions come with a cloud integration. This means that Kubernetes Services of type LoadBalancer and PersistentVolumeClaims automatically work.</span></li><li><span>A procedure to set up </span><b>addons</b><span>, such as Ingress controllers, certificate managers, intrusion detection, custom authentication, to name a few.</span></li></ol><p><span>EKS Distro launched with a </span><a href="https://distro.eks.amazonaws.com/"><span>healthy documentation and code</span></a><span>. You have several ways of using it:</span></p><ul><li><b>Build it from scratch</b><span>: The documentation and code are sufficient to build EKS Distro from scratch, specifically, the container images that make up the Kubernetes control plane components.</span></li><li><b>Start EKS-D</b><span>: If you don’t need to customize control plane images, then you can use the pre-build images by AWS from their public container registry.</span></li></ul><p><span>Our next observation is related to the level of automation of EKS Distro. Let’s take an automation scale with a few levels:</span></p><ol><li><span>Prose-only documentation.</span></li><li><span>Documentation with copy-paste-able code snippets.</span></li><li><span>Command that does everything.</span></li><li><span>API that does everything.</span></li></ol><p><span>EKS Distro is level 2: It focuses on providing a lot of documentation and copy-paste-able. code snippets. However, if you are the “TL;DR” type, EKS Distro will disappoint you. </span><b>You need to carefully read the prose to understand how to use the next code snippet.</b><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>While this could be seen as a weakness, we find it a strength. Instead of pre-baking and imposing many decisions on the user, </span><b>EKS Distro is rather un-opinionated</b><span>. It allows the user to control which decisions to take at each step, while at the same time offering “it just works” defaults.</span></p><p><span>Next observation: </span><b>EKS Distro is built on top of </b><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kops"><b>kops</b></a><span>. Comparing kops and </span><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray"><span>kubespray</span></a><span> — the two dominant open source Kubernetes cluster life-cycle managers — deserves its own article. For now, suffice to say that, correctly setting up EKS Distro requires a fair knowledge of kops for things like setting up AWS IAM roles and the DNS stack accordingly. Even small mistakes with kops — e.g., not setting up the DNS stack correctly — will make you unsuccessful with deploying EKS Distro. On the upside, if you are already familiar with kops, EKS Distro will feel like a fairly thin and unobtrusive layer on top.</span></p><p><span>As said before, EKS Distro is a fairly thin layer on top of kops. It basically adds three things:</span></p><ol><li><span>A bit of automation on top of kops.</span></li><li><span>A few fixes for Kubernetes.</span></li><li><span>The AWS IAM authenticator.</span></li></ol><p><span>Let us focus on the last two.</span></p><p><span>The control plane images </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backporting"><span>backport</span></a><span> a few Kubernetes fixes that are critical for EKS Distro. These fixes are available in the main branch of the Kubernetes project, however, backporting them allows AWS to provide these without waiting for a new Kubernetes release.</span></p><p><span>The AWS IAM authentication enables authentication with the Kubernetes cluster using AWS credentials. This does make sense for users who want to leverate AWS IAM roles for everything, including on-prem Kubernetes clusters. However, for users who aim for a cloud-agnostic strategy, </span><a href="https://github.com/dexidp/dex"><span>OpenID</span></a><span> is a more portable Kubernetes authentication solution.</span></p><p><span>Have I already mentioned how thin EKS Distro is? We were surprised to discover that it does not include an Ingress controller, a certificate manager or a log forwarded. Truly un-opinionated!</span></p><p><span>While the ride was pretty smooth, we did bump into a few minor issues:</span></p><ol><li><span>EKS Distro assumes the us-west-2 region in several places. Fortunately, due to its light packaging, fixing the scripts to deploy in my favorite region, eu-north-1, was a no-brainer.</span></li><li><span>EKS Distro blocked the first time I tried it out, due to my laptop being entropy starved and /dev/random being stuck. A simple change, to take randomness from /dev/urandom fixed the problem. In fact, our </span><a href="https://github.com/aws/eks-distro/commit/c1225ea8482db2c69da6b554e280a0365504f590"><span>Pull Request (PR)</span></a><span> was merged within hours. So another point goes to EKS Distro for being very welcoming.</span></li></ol><p><span>Good:</span></p><ul><li><span>Un-opinionated, thin, easy to modify for one’s own needs.</span></li><li><span>Based on kops and will feel familiar to existing kops users.</span></li><li><span>Comes with AWS IAM authentication.</span></li></ul><p><span>Bad:</span></p><ul><li><span>“No battery included, not even removable ones”. EKS Distro has no Ingress controller, no certificate manager, no log forwarder.</span></li><li><span>Minor gotchas, but overall a smooth ride.</span></li></ul><p><span>Ugly:</span></p><ul><li><span>Nothing really. A great AWS project, as expected.</span></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Today we are going to explore five big hacks that took place in 2020. First we'll cover two hacks that targeted Norwegian companies Sykehuspartner and NHH. Then we'll take a look at a hack that targeted the Danish company ISS. To wrap things up we'll cover what is probably the two most high profile hacks of 2020: the Twitter phish and the CWT ransom.</p>
</section><article><section><h2>Sykehuspartner</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/hyMVdWh/Skjermbilde-2020-11-20-kl-07-30-21.png" alt="Sykehuspartner logo" title="Sykehuspartner"></p>
<p>Sykehuspartner deliver IT, HR, project and logistics services to all hospitals in the Norwegian health region Helse Sør-Øst (Health South East). It manages vital IT systems for the hospitals, both clinical and administrative applications, as well as infrastructure and networks.</p>
<p>On august 22 2020 several of Sykehuspartners applications became the target of an unknown malicious actor. Only one hospital (Sykehuset Innlandet) was targeted in this attack. Not much is known by the type and scope of the attack, except for what type of data might possibly have been stolen. The potentially stolen data might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information about the deceased</li>
<li>Health information about patients from research projects</li>
<li>Personal information about employees</li>
<li>Name and social security number (fødselsnummer) of students</li>
</ul>
<p>From reports about the incident, we know that 25 patients and several employees have been notified of personal information having been stolen. Following the attack, the hospital has carried out a forced password change for all employees.</p>

<h2>NHH</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/sjQnhNF/imageedit-10-3684463812.png" alt="NHH logo" title="NHH logo"></p>
<p>In august this year, Norges handelshøgskole (NHH, English: Norwegian School of Economics), experienced a data heist. The school is one of the leading business schools in Europe and is located in the city of Bergen. </p>
<p>Usernames and passwords of both students and employees was compromised. The break in was discovered when the stolen credentials were uploaded to a “hacker” forum. The attack targeted a known vulnerability in an old version of the VPN service called Pulse Secure. An updated version that patches this vulnerability has been available since April 2019. But NHH is decommissioning the service and has thus been neglecting to update it. All students and employees were asked to change their passwords after the incident.</p>

<h2>ISS</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/XDJVmgQ/imageedit-12-3910494650.png" alt="ISS logo" title="ISS logo"></p>
<p>In the middle of February this year, ISS was hit by a ransomware attack. ISS is a global facility services company, founded in Copenhagen, Denmark. The company has 450,000 employees.</p>
<p>The ransomware was a massive malware attack across IT-systems and networks. Immediately after the attack was discovered, IT-access was removed to isolate the indicent. As reported by the company. Regardless of the actions taken, the company had to write down and change big parts of the IT-infrastructure. It is estimated that the attack will cost the company between 750 and 1340 million Norwegian kroner (NOK).</p>
<p>It was reported that customer data was not stolen.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Twitter</h2>
<p>Twitter, you know, the social media platform? Yes, that one. In July this year, it was hit with a phishing campaign that was used to target high-profile individuals, like Barack Obama, Joe Biden and Bill Gates.</p>
<p>Twitter stated that "This attack relied on a significant and concerted attempt to mislead certain employees and exploit human vulnerabilities to gain access to our internal systems".</p>
<p>The phish was used to get access to certain high-profile accounts. The compromised accounts were used to promote a bitcoin scam.</p>

<h2>CWT</h2>
<p>CWT is a travel management company that manages business travel, meetings and so on. The 27 of July this year, the company was hit by a massive ransomware attack that knocked 30,000 computers offline. The hackers claimed to have stolen two terabytes of files, including financial reports, security documents and employees’ personal data. CWT paid $4.5 million to the hackers to restore their systems. </p>
<p>One of the fascinating things about this hack was that the negotiation chat, where the company and the hackers met to talk, was left open to the public after the negotiations ended. This gives us a never before seen insight into how the negotiations between hacker and hacked works. As many others have noted after the chat became public, it is rarely advised to actually pay the hackers like CWT did. This is, of course, because of the precedence it sets and that the chance of getting scamed is very high.</p>

<p>This is of course not a complete list of all the major hacks that were reported in 2020. It sure has been a very active year in this regard. As you can see, there are many ways of being vulnerable on the internet.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>T</span>he air was warm as the skies grew dark over Diego Garcia. As the nearly full moon reached its highest point, a green sea turtle scuttled her way onto the sand. The ocean giant was more than a meter wide and nearly as long from nose to tail. Her carapace, mottled with splotches of green and black, was slick with salt water.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Turtles glide through the sea with a certain reptilian elegance, but on land their awkward, plodding movements evoke a wind-up toy in need of a few more cranks. After shuffling a suitable distance from the waterline, the turtle began to excavate a shallow hole, using her arms and legs like spades to fling pebbles and sand through the air. Nearly exhausted, she finally began to relax as she released dozens of ping-pong ball-sized eggs into the ground.</p>
<p>It was likely the first time in years sheâ€™d set flipper on dry land. Other than the moments after they hatch and crawl into the surf, sea turtles spend their entire lives in the ocean. Only when females return to lay eggs on the same beaches where they hatched do they leave the water—just briefly, for a few hours, before slipping back into the sea. They may lay several clutches of eggs during the mating season before setting off for their foraging territories. There they stay for several years, regaining energy by feasting on seagrass, before returning to their natal beach, mating just offshore, and beginning the cycle anew.</p>
<p>Having carried out the full extent of her duties as a mother, this turtle had completed a ritual thatâ€™s played out countless times on Diego Garcia, a footprint-shaped atoll in the Indian Ocean's Chagos Archipelago. Green sea turtles have used the atoll as an incubator for hundreds or thousands of generations, or perhaps longer. Each generation disperses and returns; precisely where these now-endangered reptiles go, what route they take to get there, and how they navigate, is a mystery.</p>
<p>And so on that moonlit night in October of 2017 volunteers from the U.S. military facility on Diego Garcia helped <a href="https://www.swansea.ac.uk/staff/science/biosciences/esteban-n/" target="_blank">Nicole Esteban</a>, a marine biologist and sea turtle conservationist at Swansea University, fasten a GPS transmitter to the top of the turtle's shell while she laid her eggs. The volunteers nicknamed the turtle Serenity and watched as she and the computer on her back crept back into the waves and disappeared.</p>
<p>Three months later, Serenity reached her foraging waters along a small island called Farquhar Atoll in the Seychelles archipelago. It is some four thousand kilometers west of Diego Garcia, but the GPS signals traced a circuitous route that wound through more than six thousand kilometers of open ocean. Had she had taken a more direct path, she could have accomplished the entire journey in under a month.</p>
<blockquote>Precisely where these now-endangered reptiles go, what route they take to get there, and how they navigate, is a mystery.</blockquote>
<p>It was an unusual trip in other ways, too. Typically when biologists track turtles from their nesting beaches on small islands, most wind up in coastal territory, having paddled across the open ocean until hitting a continental shelf and then turning left or right. But Serenity ended up on a flyspeck island, and many others of her cohort—Estebanâ€™s team tagged a total of 35 turtles over five years—followed suit.</p>
<p>"A number of these turtles migrated to very, very small island targets, some not more than a couple of hundred meters square,â€� says Alex Rattray, a biologist at Deakin University who was also involved in the research. A few did travel more than 5000 kilometers west to the coastlines of Somalia and Mozambique, but others pulled up short of the coast, joining Serenity elsewhere in the Seychelles archipelago; still others swam north to the Maldives islands.</p>
<p>Their destinations underscored the extraordinary nature of sea turtle migration. Itâ€™s astonishing enough that a sea turtle can navigate across thousands of miles of open ocean, with no discernible landmarks, and wind up in the correct place. Even more astonishing is when the correct place is a dot of sand with nothing but blue until the horizon in every direction.</p>
<p>It's a feat that bewildered Charles Darwin. "Even if we grant to animals a sense of the points of the compass, of which there is no evidence," he wrote, "how can we account, for instance, for the turtles which formerly congregated in multitudes, only at one season of the year, on the shores of the Isle of Ascension, finding their way to that speck of land in the midst of the great Atlantic Ocean."</p>
<p>Since Darwin wrote those words in 1873, scientists have tried to understand just how turtles make these awesome journeys. Before the invention of GPS technology, sailors crossing the globe relied on a combination of complex mechanical instruments and accurate timepieces. Much remains unknown about how turtles accomplish the same task, the only tools at their disposal resting within their own brains and bodies—but biologists have come a long way in understanding how sea turtles find their way.</p>

<p>The animated travel tracks of 35 green sea turtle migrations tracked from nesting beaches in the Chagos archipelago. Hays et al./<em>Current Biology</em></p>

<p><span>I</span>n the first month after slipping off the beaches of Diego Garcia, Serenity had logged nearly four thousand kilometers. She was still in the open ocean, north and a little east of Madagascar. Rattray wouldn't know it yet, but when he switched his computer on to check on her progress, he would find Serenity at almost precisely the longitude of her final destination in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farquhar_Atoll" target="_blank">Farquhar Atoll</a>. There was just one problem: was she was at the wrong latitude.</p>
<p>The turtle had missed her target by some two hundred kilometers. That would be like walking from New York City to Los Angeles, but accidentally winding up in Tijuana, Mexico instead. But rather than take a right turn and swim north, she kept heading west, further and further away from her goal.</p>
<p>So how did she get back on course?</p>
<p>Whether you're a sea turtle or a ship's captain, finding your way around the planet requires two tools: a map and a compass. A map tells you where you are relative to some other location: where you started out, for example, or where you want to go. A compass helps to keep you moving in a reasonably straight line.</p>
<p>"There's all sorts of ways to set and maintain a heading," says marine biologist <a href="https://lgl.com/en/staff/staff-directory/179-putman-nathan" target="_blank">Nathan Putman</a>, who studies navigation in sea turtles and salmon. Animals who have good vision can orient based on the polarization of sun light, as some birds are thought to do, or based on the position of stars in the night sky, as in dung beetles. If animals can marry their vision to an internal clock, then they can use the sun's position as a compass, accounting for its movement across the sky throughout the day. It's thought that a time-compensated sun compass, as it is called, is one of the tools that migrating monarch butterflies use to maintain their headings.</p>
<p>Other animals might orient based on the direction that persistent winds blow or the direction waves travel through the ocean. Indeed, when loggerhead sea turtles first hatch on Florida beaches, they know to swim directly into oncoming waves, a strategy that deposits them into the Gulf Stream, part of a larger network of currents called the North Atlantic Sub-tropical Gyre. These currents, which stretch from the eastern seaboard across to southern Europe and northern Africa, encircle a region known as the Sargasso Sea. By staying within the gyre, vulnerable young sea turtles can remain relatively safe.</p>
<p>In 1989 a meteorological fluke helped Ken Lohmann, a biologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, confirm that hatchlings use waves as a guide. That year, Hurricane Hugo temporarily caused waves to travel towards the open ocean rather than towards Florida's Atlantic coast. When Lohmann dropped newly hatched turtles into these conditions, they swam into the waves, just as their innate programming instructed them to—and as a result, they went the wrong way.</p>
<p>But what if turtles were to hatch on a calm, windless night with no waves to point the way? Lohmann brought hatchlings into a laboratory to find out. In complete darkness and with no other cues available to guide them, they swam towards the northeast, which in their natural environs would have safely launched them into the Gulf Stream. When he then induced an artificial magnetic field around the tanks, the turtles continued in what they thought was a northeasterly direction. In reality, thanks to Lohmann's magnetic misdirection, they were swimming in precisely the opposite direction. The results confirmed that they really did use Earth's magnetic field.</p>
<blockquote>Sea turtles hatch with at least two strategies for finding their way pre-programmed into their brains: the movement of waves and the Earth's magnetic field.</blockquote>

<p>Taken together, Lohmannâ€™s experiments revealed that sea turtles hatch with at least two strategies for finding their way pre-programmed into their brains: the movement of waves and the Earth's magnetic field.</p>
<p>Currents around Diego Garcia are of course different from those off the Florida coast. Turtles born in Diego Garcia are delivered into the South Equatorial Current, which is part of a larger system called the Indian Ocean Gyre. The parameters of Earth's magnetic field differ as well. But the underlying principle remains the same: turtles are born with a set of instructions that, at least most of the time, safely delivers them into the open ocean.</p>
<p>"Offshore migration is really just the first part in a longer transoceanic migration,â€� says Lohmann, one that occupies the first five to eight years of a sea turtleâ€™s life—a period sometimes called â€œthe lost years,â€� spent in the open ocean, where sea turtles were once thought to lazily drift wherever the currents took them. But Lohmann realized that this strategy could be deadly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If turtles in Florida floated passively on the North Atlantic Sub-tropical Gyre, for example, then after they cross the …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
I got involved in wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ASpencerk&amp;action=history&amp;year=2006&amp;month=-1&amp;tagfilter=">very early</a>.

It was one of the most revealing things in my life, watching it being laughed at, to become the center of, and authority of, human knowledge.

It was obvious that it was working. The lag of this was 5 years or more.

Wikipedia was an experiment that proved itself, when every graph was going up and to the right.

Some of the graphs are now going down.

</p><p>Wikipedia's Markup language:</p><p>
One of the central design decisions in wikipedia is that <span>all information</span> is stored in an editable document.
This poses a huge amount of challenges for caching and scaling wikipedia. It's not a database, that you can run a script on.

Worse though, is that all of it's content is buried in this ad-hoc, impenetrable, opaque, and mostly <i>un-parsable</i> format.

If wikipedia had used <i>markdown</i>, <i>html</i>, or some <i>standardised format</i>, any parser would flip-it into other future formats.

Wikipedia's custom language is just <a href="https://github.com/spencermountain/wtf_wikipedia/blob/master/README.md">clearly insane</a>, undocumented, hopeless.
There's a team <span>(of great people!)</span> at wikimedia <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/tag/parsoid/">constantly working on it</a>, and unable to make any backwards-incompatible changes. I imagine their lives are hard.
People are creating weird new syntax concepts all the time.

Here's the markup for the <b>first sentence</b> of the Albert Einstein wikipedia article:
<img src="http://blog.spencermounta.in/2019/wikipedias-in-trouble/assets/albert-einstein.jpg">

The first wikimedia parser was called <a href="https://github.com/earwig/mwparserfromhell/">mwparserfromhell</a>. DBPedia, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/LOD_Cloud_2014-08.svg">the center of the semantic web</a>, after years of work, has only ever offered limited parsing from categories and infoboxes.
Much of the early-years at <b>Freebase</b> were spent trying, with limited-success, at parsing wikipedia.
I've spent <a href="https://github.com/spencermountain/wtf_wikipedia/graphs/commit-activity">years</a> trying to parse it myself.
I'm a shitty programmer. <i>WolframAlpha</i>, and many other serious companies are using my parser,
       which is <span>down right hilarious</span>.

<img id="rtl" src="http://blog.spencermounta.in/2019/wikipedias-in-trouble/assets/rtl.jpg"></p><p>yes, arabic editors must write it in right-to-left, <a href="https://youtu.be/OCQd02hORJQ">somehow</a>.</p><p>

It's hard to describe how much of a serious problem this is.
Wikipedia's content is never going to go anywhere, or be used by anything.

Wikipedia may slowly die-off - like myspace, or geocities - but it's information will not go on.

Play-around in the official wikipedia android app. Many pages are unreadable.
There is a good-deal of <i>clearfix</i>, and <span>table-span</span> logic, mushed right into the syntax.
Most developers will not touch this kind of stuff.

There will be no move to a wikipedia 2.

</p><p>Static copies of dynamic content</p><p>
The contents of the english wikipedia dump are as follows, (as of Jan 2019):
</p><p>
of the <b>14m</b> records in the wikipedia dump, only <b>5.5m</b> (40%) are public-facing articles.

   <span>Yup.</span>
This does not include deleted pages, or old versions, either.


<b>Redirects:</b>
A computer-science 101 problem is to implement a fuzzy string matching. There's usually a section in the textbook about it:
</p><div>
<p><img src="http://blog.spencermounta.in/2019/wikipedias-in-trouble/assets/clr.jpg"></p><p>oh yes, right here in chapter 34.</p><p>
there are <b>8,550,441</b> redirects in wikipedia.
They are mostly typos, or case-changes, and are mostly created by hand, every day.

<span>and what happens to a redirect when a page gets deleted, or merged, or spli - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Link_rot">Yup</a>.</span>
</p></div>

<p><b>Talk pages:</b>
Wikipedia has 35m registered users. When a user joins, a bot will often send them a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Welcome">{{welcome}}</a> template.
Sometimes nice users will do it themselves. It looks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Kj_aviator">like this</a>.

   - when this happens, this creates a new user page, with <b>a copy of this text</b> each time.

There are millions of examples of this in the dump. The same text, verbatim over and over.

The same process happens with <b>'Wikiprojects'</b>. Bots go around adding templates, by creating a talk page, and adding a template to it.

The same process happens with <i>deleted pages, fair-use warnings, and some bot edits</i>. Each time an edit happens, a new page is created, and boilerplate text gets thrown into it.
Resulting in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:XTC_discography">this</a>:
<img src="http://blog.spencermounta.in/2019/wikipedias-in-trouble/assets/boilerplate.png"></p><hr><p>
So let's get things straight:
in <b>1993</b>, a small japanese game company created <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-Rank_Thunder_Tanjouhen">this videogame</a>:
</p><p><img src="http://blog.spencermounta.in/2019/wikipedias-in-trouble/assets/thunder.jpg">
</p><p>
• In <b>2008</b>, a wikipedia user created the article with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A-Rank_Thunder_Tanjouhen&amp;oldid=205879125">two sentences and a link</a>.

• In the past 10 years since, the page has been edited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A-Rank_Thunder_Tanjouhen&amp;oldid=205879125">26 times by bots</a>.

• this created a Talk page filled with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:A-Rank_Thunder_Tanjouhen">11 automated sentences</a>.

A huge bulk of the wikipedia database is this boilerplate text. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:764_Gedania">this asteroid</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:NS3_(HCV)">this virus</a>, or this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Oceania_Judo_Union">judo club</a>.

... and remember, if we wanted to change this text, we'd have to go and edit each of these pages - and because this syntax is so nuts, <b>bots have a hard time</b> making even simple stylistic changes, without ruining a whole page.

oh, so what happens to these auto-generated talk pages when a page is deleted, merged, or spli- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:578_Happelia">yup</a>

<b id="automation">Automated articles:</b>
There is a lot of disagreement about how much of wikipedia is generated by bots, and if this matters.
There's no way of knowing. Any boring-themed article with a few sentences, a reference, and an infobox probably won't get deleted.
So nothing's stopping you from spitting-out articles from a <b>database of enzymes</b>, or <b>college rugby players</b>, or season statistics for defunct sports teams.
</p><p><img src="http://blog.spencermounta.in/2019/wikipedias-in-trouble/assets/enzymes.jpg">
  <img src="http://blog.spencermounta.in/2019/wikipedias-in-trouble/assets/subgiants.png">
</p><p>
I have nothing against bots, I have nothing against the long-tail, but I think automated article-creation is responsible for a good amount of the wikipedia's claimed growth, over the past few years.
We need to be up-front about this, if we're talking about the health of the project.

Here's the distribution of words in english wikipedia, by the size of articles:
</p>

<div>
<p><span>ok hey,</span> I don't mind that the wm developers didn't develop a fancy search index, in 2001.
That's fine.
Nobody could have predicted the success and scale of wikipedia early on.
</p><p>
What angers me though
         - <i>and it should anger you</i> -
is that these problems has not been fixed in the <b>18 years</b> since.

God damn them.

Well-meaning people are wasting their time on this <span>everyday</span>.

Any <i>startup job-interview</i> asks questions about implementing a system like this.
Any CS grad can create a lucene index, to handle typos.
Some of it is complicated. Some of it is basic competence.

<span>It's annoying to whine</span>,
     but at some point, we're right to be angry at wikipedia.

            that it cannot find 2nd gear,
     when the rest of the world is zipping-along.
</p>
</div>

<p>Wikidata</p><p>
In 2007 Danny Hillis raised $57 million dollars,<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/metawebtechnologies#section-overview">[1]</a> bought-out the <b>entire</b> MIT semantic-web group,
hired 50~ employees, (including <a href="https://www.apple.com/leadership/john-giannandrea/">this person</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Toby-Segaran/e/B001I9RQVS">this person</a>, <a href="http://davidhuynh.net/">this person</a>) and got an office in the mission.

They reconciled all of wikipedia, the entire musicbrainz database, the entire open-library database, the tvdb database, and all of wordnet.
They signed a (massive) deal to import <b>all collections of the stanford library</b>.<a href="https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub152/stanford-linked-data-workshop/">[2]</a>

They hit <b>high-90%</b> classification of all <a href="https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/44818.pdf"><b>50 million</b></a> entities (wikipedia has 5m)
They were evaluated at very-high 90's accuracy by several third-parties.

Facebook, Bing, Amazon, and Google all began using its data in nearly real-time in their search products.

This was one of the largest and most ambitious software projects in history.

In 2010 freebase was bought for a whack of money, and then killed-off by google.
When google announced they would be shutting down the API, they offered to import all of this data to a new wikimedia project called <span>wikidata</span>.

Wikidata was 4-or-5 Lua developers, in Germany, on a few research grants.

</p><p>and they said no. 😐</p><p>

so they said this data didn't meet it's guidelines regarding sourced data.

    <i>... aren't you pulling information <b>from wikipedia</b> blindly?</i>

    <i>... what about your (~60%) unreferenced facts?</i>

    <i>... aren't you <b>multiplying vandalism</b> from multi-lingual wikipedias?</i>

    <i>... how do you use, or verify references?</i>

They built a tool to <b>hand-transfer each freebase fact</b>, which if you have a calculator, may seem funny.
<span>(at 10 people clicking full-time, would have taken 10 million years)</span>

8 years later, <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page">Wikidata</a> remains tiny, buggy, unused, and worse - <i>majority unreferenced</i>.
I mean, they're pulling their data from wikipedia, which gets vandalized almost every minute!

It's accomplished very-little from its 5-year plan. They write academic papers.
They still don't really offer a rest api.
       ...creating new types or properties is I think, possible? or it's supposed to be...

It's got few of the safeguards, momentum, features, and ambition that Freebase had a full decade ago.
If wikidata was a company, it would not exist anymore, and you wouldn't have heard of it.

But Wikimedia places <b>banner-ads</b> on <span>hours of eye-blistering user-created content</span>,
begging children, students, and poor-people for money.
and they choose to be this petty, pithy and behind-the-times.

</p><p>Category-system</p><p>
It's a beautiful idea, to classify information with category-scheme, <a href="https://humane.computer/review-the-science-of-managing-our-digital-stuff/">until it falls-apart</a>.

<a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html"><img src="http://blog.spencermounta.in/2019/wikipedias-in-trouble/assets/shirky-category.jpg"></a>
Wikipedia has many-thousands of categories. They <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Dump_reports/Category_cycles">loop-around</a> all-over the place.

</p><p>
People:
    → Musicians
        → Singers
              → American_Idol
                  → Books_about_American_Idol
</p><p>
or worse:
</p><p><span>Albanian language</span>:
    → Albanian-speaking countries and territories
      → Kosovo (region)
        → Kosovo
          → Kosovar society
            → Languages of Kosovo
              → <span>Albanian language</span>
</p><p>
if you're ever too-cheerful, and wanting to feel depressed, have a visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/Today">Categories for deletion/Today</a>,
where you'll see precious human-life spent debating whether <b>'Category:Goth'</b> should exist, if it is a genre of music, if it's is a fashion-style, etc.

Work is being ravenously deleted all the time. You'll get sad thinking about it.

  <p>what about all this stuff →</p>
  <p><img src="http://blog.spencermounta.in/2019/wikipedias-in-trouble/assets/infobox.png">
</p></div><p>
You're right.

Wikipedia has good structured-data in <b>infoboxes, lists, tables, citations, etc</b>.

The issue is, as of Feb 2019, Wikipedia has <b>634,755 different kinds of templates</b> (see this <a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/spencer-scratch/allTemplates-2018-10-26.tsv">21mb download</a>).

Yes, there are all different.

Yes, there are <span>templates-within-templates-with-escaping-with-escaping</span>.

Even if you parse them perfectly, how do you know that for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:HorseDeathYear">Template:HorseDeathYear</a>, the third parameter is the <b>birth date of the horse</b>, and the fourth is the birth-month?

see, for example:

• <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:16-Team_bracket_templates">Tennis Brackets vs Table Tennis Brackets</a>

• '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Birth_date_and_age">Birth_date_and_age</a>' vs '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Birth-date_and_age">Birth-date_and_age</a>'.

• <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Trapezoidnotation">a template for a Trapezoid unicode symbol</a>
It's just a straight-up mess.

If you're thinking, <i>gee wikipedia editors must feel exhausted and stupid</i> - you're right.

<p>Live image of ascender’s taking off from the lander. Photo: CNSA</p><p>The Chinese national flag shines an even brighter red from moon, and from now on it will be a grand reminder for stargazers from all over the world of the excitement and inspiration we felt from Apollo missions more than half a century ago.</p><p>Having packed samples of soil and rocks from the Earth's only natural satellite within 19 hours after its smooth soft landing, the ascender of the Chinese spacecraft using the lander as a launch pad, took off from the moon surface, according to the China National Space Administration Thursday evening.</p><p>The Chinese space agency said in a statement the CNSA sent to the Global Times on Thursday evening, the Chang'e-5 ascender has successfully taken off from the lunar surface with soil and rock samples, and sent to the lunar orbiter some 15 kilometers away with the 3,000-newton thrust engine.&nbsp;</p><p>Right before the lift-off of Chang'e-5's ascender from lunar surface, the lander vehicle of the Chinese spacecraft unfolded the five-star red national flag, a genuine one made from fabrics, marking a first in the country's aerospace history.</p><p>The probe's successful launch from the lunar surface, as some observers believe, marks the completion of probably the most challenging step in the mission.</p><center><img src="https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2020/2020-12-03/4239fa1e-7448-4bb3-aa85-a3f2c1a3bf08.jpeg"></center>
<p>Flags on the moon Infographic: GT</p><p>"This is the first attempt in China's aerospace history to lift off from a celestial body other than Earth," chief editor of Aerospace Knowledge magazine Wang Ya'nan said. "The launch is a major test, in that the vehicle had to rely entirely on automatic maneuvers without any ground command."</p><p>Wang explained to the Global Times that the launch from the moon could not afford any time delay. "If the probe receives a command from the Earth to help it control the separation, altitude and speed, there will be at least one second delay, which will put the process in great danger."</p><center><img src="https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2020/2020-12-04/dcc27158-a339-47cd-911b-ab2c6000a08c.jpg"></center>
<p>Photo: CNSA</p><p>Another factor that posed a challenge to the lunar takeoff is that the lander-ascender combination might sit on a slope, which would bring uncertainty to the probe's altitude and position. It means that the probe must ensure its own altitude is precise enough to enter the designated orbit through automatic decision-making, according to a statement sent to the Global Times from the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC.)</p><p>Chinese researchers have conducted numerous ground simulations to verify the takeoff, but the particularities of the lunar environment have made the verifications difficult, the CASC said.&nbsp;</p><p>The rendezvous and docking, if successful, could be of great value to other deep-space or even manned missions in the future, the significance of which would be no less than the Apollo mission, once the name card of human lunar exploration activities during the Cold War, Chinese analysts said.</p><p>"It will be a milestone for China's aerospace development," Song Zhongping, an aerospace expert and TV commentator, said, calling it "a foresighted practice that lays a technological foundation for future deep-space explorations."</p><p>It will also verify the viability of manned lunar landing missions, and even the construction of a lunar research base, or Mars missions, he told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p><center><img src="https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2020/2020-12-03/7efca0cc-975e-491f-8f76-05cb5b7bbfe6.jpg"></center>

Photo: CASIC</p><p>Lunar surface substances the lander vehicle collected by scooping and drilling the landing area in around 19 hours, have been sealed and packed in a vacuum container on board the ascender, CNSA said earlier on Thursday.</p><p>Payloads on board the Chang'e-5 lander vehicle, including its lunar soil composition analytical instrument, are working normally, carrying out planned scientific tasks and providing information support for sampling.</p><p>After taking off from the lunar surface, the ascender will rendezvous and dock with an orbital module which is flying and waiting in orbit at an average altitude of 200 kilometers above the moon. The re-entry capsule will then carry the lunar sample and bring them to a designated site in North China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region by mid-December.</p><center><img src="https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2020/2020-12-04/2c167277-3ccb-4a13-8984-c8fcb52b8d88.jpeg"></center>

<p>Chang'e-5 lunar probe carries out automatic sample collecting work on moon surface. Photo: CNSA</p><p><strong>Flag mission accomplished&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong><br>More stylish than previous Chang'e landing missions, the lander of Chang'e-5 displayed the five-star red national flag, made of genuine fabric, on the moon.&nbsp;</p><p>The Chinese national flag made its moon debut in December 2013 during the country's first lunar landing mission of Chang'e-3, and it was recorded in pictures from the spacecraft's lander and its rover Yutu-1 took for each other.</p><p>Chang'e-4 lander and rover Yutu-2 brought China's national flag to the dark side of the moon, as the Chinese spacecraft made a historic landing in the unvisited region in January 2019.</p><p>The flags that Chang'e-3 and -4 carried were in the form of the craft's coatings, rather than an actual flag. Chinese space technological development has allowed it to take a step forward in the Chang'e-5 mission, the third consecutive safe soft landing on the moon in seven years.&nbsp;</p><p>The Chang'e-5 flag presentation system was developed by China Space Sanjiang Group under the State-owned China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation, better known as the CASIC.</p><p>To ensure a complete and smooth unfolding of the flag, the system adopted a secondary rod-type structure, which is applied in solar panel extending for satellites and other types of spacecraft, CASIC developers told the Global Times on Thursday.</p><center>
</center><p>The system weight has been controlled at around one kilogram, and all connecting parts of the system have been given special protection, such as coldness-resistance measures, to help overcome unfavorable lunar surface conditions, including a drastic temperature difference on the moon ranging from 150 C to minus 150 C, Li Yunfeng, the project leader, said in a statement the CASIC company sent to the Global Times.</p><p>"An ordinary national flag on Earth would not survive the severe lunar environment," so the research team also spent more than a year selecting the proper materials to make sure the eventual flag would be strong enough, survive under extreme coldness and heat and capable of showing the fine colors of the national flag and remain so forever, said Cheng Chang, another leading member of the developer team.</p><p>The national flag, 2,000 millimeters wide and 900 millimeter tall, represents cutting-edge technology, they said.</p><p>How to preserve its original color and shape are the two most crucial questions in designing a national flag that must survive more than 380,000 kilometers away from Earth, under extreme temperatures and radiation during its journey, Wang Ya'nan told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p><p>To get a sense of how difficult the task it is, five of the six flags (except for the one Apollo 11 placed on the moon) brought to the moon in the late 1960s and early 1970s during six US crewed moon landings, have been bleached white due to decades-long solar radiation, although they are reportedly still standing and casting shadows.</p><p>Many reports say the Apollo 11 flag was blown over by the exhaust from the ascent engine during lift-off.</p><p>The Soviet Union was the first country to imprint its national symbol on the moon, with a football-sized metal ball, carved with its national flag, full of explosives, smashing to the lunar ground in the Luna 2 mission in 1959.</p><p>Compared to such a method, China has a more advanced approach, which also greatly increased the complexity of the design, Wang noted.</p><center><strong><img src="https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2020/2020-12-01/bb881cd5-4e1a-4040-8160-b364db57d633.jpeg"></strong></center>
<p>A panorama of the moon's surface by the lander-ascender combination of China’s Chang’e-5 probe after its smooth moon landing on Tue Photo: CNSA</p><p><strong>Iconic inspiration</strong></p><p>The Chinese flag that Chang'e-5 displayed officially became the first and only fabric national flag that has ever been placed on the moon in the 21st century, which reminds many of the classic footage of an American national flag planted by Neil Armstrong in the Apollo 11 lunar mission more than five decades ago, observers said.</p><p>And they hailed that as the fresh and new icon of human's lunar exploration, the Chinese national flag would inspire today's mankind, just as Apollo 11 did, encourage and celebrate generations to make an endeavor to space.&nbsp;</p><p>Displaying a national flag on a celestial body represents the comprehensive strength and technological advancement of the country, Song noted.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;"Yesterday's memory is still fresh and clear, when the US astronauts stepped outside their cabins and planted the first flag in human history, an American national flag, on the moon in 1969," Song Zhongping recalled. "But China is about to showcase our own national flag as well, which I believe is a recognition of the achievements and breakthroughs that we have made, which will be the most valuable thing."</p><p>Some readers have left comments under images and video of the Chang'e-5 landing published on the Global Times twitter account in recent days, saying they would not be convinced and acknowledge China's achievements until the lander takes an actual photo of the American flag planted by the previous Apollo mission.&nbsp;</p><p>"Is it an original video, or a TikTok post taken in the Gobi desert," one Twitter user wrote. "Where is the lunar dust while landing," another asked.</p><p>The landing was closely followed by space agencies from all over the world, and the European Space Agency, Russia's Roscosmos and …</p></div></div></div>

<p>If you swung by my Twitter profile in the last week, you probably saw this:</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>I'm not sure of the precise causes of me being locked out, but I have several abnormal usage factors that probably put me on the high end of Twitter's bot risk system:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I currently live in Singapore but am primarily active during US hours and have a US Phone Number</li>
  <li>I post about 30 tweets a day, probably on the high end of most Twitter users. (30 sounds like a lot, but it's mostly replies, and I maybe post 2-3 actual top tweets a day)</li>
  <li>I switch between and manage three different accounts (<a href="https://twitter.com/Coding_Career">Coding Career</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/SvelteSociety">Svelte Society</a>) multiple times a day</li>
  <li>As far as I know I have not been reported on, but I do have people that strongly dislike me and they may have used the report button against me. Can't rule that out as a factor.</li>
  <li>Anecdotally <a href="https://twitter.com/b2m9/status/1295748479713779712?s=20">some IPs seem more risky</a> than others - I also use a VPN for work which probably shows me jumping across multiple countries in a single day, which is certainly suspicious on the face of it</li>
  <li>I have also noticed I get verification checks more often when I use scheduled tweets.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you clicked through my scary profile you also saw this:</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/6xjg8jxiwgidwffvwsnu.png" alt="Alt Text">
</p>
<p>I swear that I haven't mass unfollowed everybody! Most people see this and assume that I used some script to mass unfollow everyone and therefore got flagged as a bot. <strong>The reality is the exact opposite</strong> - I got flagged as a bot, and by default Twitter temporarily removes all follows.</p>
<p>It will be restored once I regain my Twitter account (I've filed a support ticket and am trying to reach out to friends at Twitter for help), but this is the exact user experience I wanted to talk about for this post.</p>
<p>First, a quick detour for a personal anecdote.</p>
<section>
  <h2 id="aside-my-time-as-a-cuban-detainee"><a href="#aside-my-time-as-a-cuban-detainee">Aside: My Time As A Cuban Detainee</a></h2>
  <p>A long time ago I visited Havana with some college friends. Right after landing we headed into a restaurant, all our luggage in tow. After we were done eating, I stood up and turned around - only to find all my luggage gone! Someone had stolen it while we were eating. The restaurant staff of course swore up and down that they had not seen who had taken it.</p>
  <p>Losing all your luggage on day 1 of a weeklong trip sucks, but what is worse is that <strong>my passport was in my luggage</strong>. I needed it to head back to the US at the end of my trip.</p>
  <p>If you've never lost a passport while traveling before, it's a quick trip to bureaucratic hell. If your country has an embassy where you are traveling, you can usually get it reissued in the embassy. But we were in <em>Cuba</em> - and my country had no embassy here. We reported my case to the authorities, but they had no idea what to do. I was an edge case. Worse still, because I said I had come from the US and couldn't produce any papers to prove my identity, I was detained at the police headquarters for questioning on suspicion of being a spy. (<em>I was never really at any risk - being Asian and speaking poor Spanish, I would have made for a pretty lousy spy</em>).</p>
  <p>There was a lot to figure out over the ensuing <em>month</em> of my ordeal - money, lodging, language barriers, administrative hurdles. My family and friends hit the panic button for me and my case reached the ears of both Arlen Specter on the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee and George Yeo, the Singapore Foreign Affairs Minister. We eventually worked it out, but every night for 4 weeks I would wander up and down <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malec%C3%B3n,_Havana">the Malecón</a>, listening to the crashing waves, not knowing when I could ever leave the country. If I could swim <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southernmost_point_buoy">the 90 miles to Key West</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_feet,_dry_feet_policy">dry my feet</a>, I might theoretically make it back to the US on my own.</p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/3i8nh2cgaoj3jlrl9ecm.jpg" alt="Alt Text">
  </p>
  <p>But most of all, I thought a lot about <strong>the humanity of having a piece of paper be more important than the human it represents</strong>. I could be physically standing in front of the immigration officer with a lie detector test on and steadfastly stating all manner of provable personal detail, and they would not let me through unless I had a small piece of paper the size of my hand.</p>
  <p>We do this a lot - passports, voter registration cards, national ID systems, licenses, and insurance proofs - mostly because some humans are untrustworthy and try to exploit the system.</p>
  <p>But we often fail to design for people who are innocent and simply don't fit the system in some way.</p>

  <h2 id="the-consequences-of-not-being-provably-human"><a href="#the-consequences-of-not-being-provably-human">The Consequences of Not Being Provably Human</a></h2>
  <p>Twitter has a way in which they expect you to verify you are human - you should get a call or text message with a code, that you then enter to prove humanity. This is what I normally get (about once every 1-2 months), and I can receive text messages from Twitter, so I can usually prove humanity with no issue.</p>
  <p>This time, for some reason, I am on a code path that doesn't offer a text message option, and Twitter somehow doesn't make international US number calls, leading to this infinite loop that I think is a bug:</p>
  
  <p>As a result of this unfortunate design:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>My friends think I mass unfollowed them, because Twitter temporarily reduced my follow count to 0</li>
    <li>People who DM me think I am ignoring them, because Twitter doesn't inform them that I am currently locked out</li>
    <li>None of my past tweets show up at all in <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Aswyx&amp;src=typed_query">Twitter search</a>, which is problematic because I <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1245281982797373441?lang=en">use Twitter as a Second Brain</a>. If you read any of my blogposts, you will see that the rich link density of my references mainly come from taking notes in public over an extended period of time.</li>
    <li>I was unable to engage in the normal personal and professional activity I would do during Black Friday and AWS Re:invent</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I've filed a support ticket with Twitter, but you can imagine that support for a 330 million user service isn't very responsive. People who have been through this tell me the only way to resolve it is to hit up a Twitter employee to get past the masses of unrelated and less urgent support issues.</p>

  <h2 id="humans-proving-humanity-to-machines"><a href="#humans-proving-humanity-to-machines">Humans Proving Humanity To Machines</a></h2>
  <p>In the grand scheme of things, I know this is minor. I've actually taken it as a welcome social media detox, which I usually take voluntarily in December anyways. But when it's not on my terms, I lose the ability to manage the personal and professional relationships I've painstakingly built up over the past 3-4 years.</p>
  <p>Above all, I think there's an <em>indignity</em> in humans having to prove to machines that they are human, and the error resolution mechanism is to send a ticket to a faceless and unresponsive support email, and the only real way to get around it is again to re-establish human connections.</p>
  <p>I think more about all the other ways that we as software developers and designers fail to honor the dignity of humans trying to interact with the systems we create.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18205610/google-captcha-ai-robot-human-difficult-artificial-intelligence">In 2014</a>, Google pitted one of its machine learning algorithms against humans in solving the most distorted text CAPTCHAs: the computer got the test right 99.8 percent of the time, while the humans got a mere 33 percent. It doesn't impact everyone equally - if you as a sighted, able bodied user struggle with CAPTCHAs, imagine the elderly or differently abled. Most services do not offer any alternative resolution when you cannot prove you are human. This is a problem when your service has essentially killed off the offline alternative and is essential for their basic needs.</p>
  <p>In Eric Meyer's <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2016/01/25/designing-for-crisis-design-for-real-life/">Designing for Crisis</a>, he describes how an inaccessible hospital website nearly risked the life of his daughter. I shudder to think how it might be made worse by perfectly well meaning software engineers who don't think about the humanity of the failure path. Imagine if you had to log in to something to save your child's life, and it presented you with a CAPTCHA you couldn't pass.</p>

December 4, 2020 | https://functional.christmas/2020/4 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://functional.christmas/2020/4">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Today I want to give you an introduction to the programming language Elixir, some of its features and why you might want to check it out!</p>
</section><article><section><h2>The basics</h2>
<p>First things first: Elixir is a concurrent functional language that runs on the Erlang VM. It is inspired by many different languages where Ruby and Erlang are most obvious ones based on the syntax.</p>
<p>Elixir is a <a href="https://thinkingelixir.com/elixir-in-the-type-system-quadrant/">strong, dynamically typed language</a>. This puts it in the same category as Ruby and Python and it has optional functionality for compile time type checking as well.Elixirs data structures are immutable, but variables can be reassigned/rebound. <sup><sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup></sup> This was a bit strange for me in that I got started with FP through Elm where there are no variables, just constants.</p>
<p>Elixir inherits a lot its data structures and related syntax from Erlang which in many ways is its biggest influence. <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2013/08/08/elixir-design-goals/">Elixir Design Goals</a> describes the relation to Erlang like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elixir is meant to be compatible with the Erlang VM and the existing ecosystem. When we talk about Erlang, we can break it into three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A functional programming language, called Erlang</li>
<li>A set of design principles, called OTP (Open Telecom Plaform)</li>
<li>The Erlang Virtual Machine, referred to as EVM or BEAM</li>
</ul>
<p>Elixir runs in the same virtual machine and is compatible with OTP. Not only that, all the tools and libraries available in the Erlang ecosystem are also available in Elixir, simply because there is no conversion cost from calling Erlang from Elixir and vice-versa.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a great feature of Elixir that we will talk more about later.</p>
<p>As for other inspirations Elixir has docstrings from Python, polymorphism and protocols from Clojure, macros and meta-programming from different Lisps, just to name a few. <sup><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></sup></p>
<h3>Hello World!</h3>
<p>As I said, Elixir is a concurrent functional programming language. For the functional part it means that Elixir mainly uses functions and modules for code structure and has other features that are associated with functional languages. We'll talk about the concurrent part later. </p>
<p>A hello world example in Elixir might look something like this:</p>
<div data-language="elixir"><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> HelloWorld
  <span>def</span> hello_world <span>do</span>
    IO<span>.</span>puts<span>(</span><span>"Hello, World!"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here we define a module with a function that simply writes "Hello, World!" to the console.</p>
<h2>Killer applications</h2>
<p>Many programming languages has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_application">"killer apps"</a>; libraries, frameworks and use cases, that in themself are enough to justify the transition to the language or try it out. For Ruby it was the web framework Ruby on Rails and in many ways Elixir has its own Rails: Phoenix.</p>
<h3>Phoenix web framework</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix</a> is inspired by Rails (the team originally behind Elixir was previously a Ruby shop) and was an early addition to the Elixir community. The creators of Phoenix has learned from years of Rails development and made their own opinions in addition to the natural changes needed when going from an object oriented language to a functional language.
Compared to Rails Phoenix has with the help of the Erlang VM great performance. Some of you might have heard about Phoenix' amazing <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/the-road-to-2-million-websocket-connections">2 million simultaneous web sockets</a> benchmark!</p>
<h3>The Nerves Project</h3>
<p>Another interesting project in the Elixir ecosystem is the embedded/IoT project <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves</a>. Nerves makes it possible to use Elixir code to create embedded system where previously you would have had to use a low level language like C. This does not stop you from bringing your own code (like C, C++, Python, Rust, and more) while using Nerves as a platform for your IoT project.
The project web site says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nerves is a complete IoT platform and infrastructure for you to build and deploy maintainable embedded systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The BEAM and OTP</h2>
<p>When talking about the advantages of Elixir it is hard to not talk about the advantages of Erlang and its virtual machine, the BEAM (Bogdan's Erlang Abstract Machine). It is in many ways the biggest selling point for Elixir. We are now talking about the concurrent part of Elixir. Erlang and the BEAM has shown its resiliency over many years, exemplified in giving Ericsson 9 nines (99.9999999%) availability in their AXD301 switch.<sup><sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup></sup> It is known for its "let it break" philosophy and self-healing properties and by being compatible with Erlang, Elixir inherits a lot of these traits.</p>
<p>Elixirs creator, Jose Valim, attributes one of the motivational factors for the creation of Elixir to the rise of multi-core CPUs and the need to utilize these. Ruby and other languages with a global interperter lock (GIL) limits this, but the Erlang VM and the tools and design prinsiples of OTP have proven to be a great choice for creating concurrent, performant and resilient applications.</p>
<h3>Everything is a process</h3>
<p>Everything in the BEAM is a process. These are not OS processes, but lightweight processes which can be cheaply spawned and killed. In his PhD thesis the co-inventor of Erlang, Joe Armstrong, summarized Erlangs principles regarding processes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Everything is a process.</li>
<li>Processes are strongly isolated.</li>
<li>Process creation and destruction is a lightweight operation.</li>
<li>Message passing is the only way for processes to interact.</li>
<li>Processes have unique names.</li>
<li>If you know the name of a process you can send it a message.</li>
<li>Processes share no resources.</li>
<li>Error handling is non-local.</li>
<li>Processes do what they are supposed to do or fail.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Sidenote: For some this may sound vaguely familiar. Some object oriented languages has had similar principles, but instead of processes they are applied to objects. Smalltalk is reported to be one of the inspirations to Erlang and it is fun to think about Erlang being a functional language but still be more object oriented than some object oriented languages. This is of course not the case as the definition of OOP has changed over time and Erlang is a functional language, but it is fun to ponder the similarities. 😄 Back to the main story! 😅</p>
<p>These unique principles for processes where they communicate through messages lays a great foundation for creating concurrent application, but there is one more piece to the puzzle: OTP.</p>
<h3>OTP - The Open Telecom Platform</h3>
<p>As with so many other parts of this article OTP is a big topic and could be a separate article, but I'll try make it short! Today the name is a bit strange but it was created by Ericsson for their telephone switches in the 80s and 90s so in that context in makes more sense.</p>
<p>OTP is an integral part of many Erlang applications. In essence OTP is a set of design principles and standards including tools and libraries to make it easier to create applications that adheres to them.<sup><sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup></sup> </p>
<p>Since Elixir is compatible with OTP we can leverage these principles and technologies that has been battle tested in high-pressure and critical applications for decades!</p>
<h2>The take-away</h2>
<p>Luckily you don't need to understand or know much about Erlang, BEAM and OTP.
Without deep knowledge of these topics you can still reap the benefits of highly performing web applications and resilient IoT applications. It would certainly help but it is not a prerequisite. This is the great thing about Elixir: it is an approachable language with battle tested underpinnings! 💪</p>
<p>It might not be your idea of a perfect language. It is not mine either, but that does not stop me from using the great tools at my disposal. If you are all into Haskell or the likes it might not be something you would use and that is OK. Whatever your preferences are you might now know a little more about Elixir and Erlang and some more knowledge is always a good thing. 😄</p>
<p>If you would like to check Elixir out I recommend checking out <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html">the official Getting started guide</a> or the interactive guide <a href="https://try-elixir.herokuapp.com/">Try Elixir</a> and then trying out a project with Phoenix or Nerves. Hands-on experience is always better than something you read on the internet! 🤓</p>
<p>Psst! By the way: there are other languages that run on the BEAM. <a href="https://lfe.io/">Lisp variants</a> and lately some work on <a href="https://gleam.run/">strong statically compiled ML-like languges</a> if you are into that!</p>

<p>I’ve used Google Fonts in prototypes and in 10M+ MAU products. It’s incredibly easy to get started with and provides an amazing font discovery. That’s also why it’s currently still used on over <a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/websitelist/Google-Font-API">42M websites</a>!</p>
<p>This convenience has its price: Performance. Many <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/fast-google-fonts-with-cloudflare-workers/">have</a> <a href="https://medium.com/clio-calliope/making-google-fonts-faster-aadf3c02a36d">already</a> <a href="https://www.keycdn.com/blog/web-font-performance#disadvantages-of-web-fonts">pointed</a> <a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/self-hosted-fonts-vs-google-fonts-api/">out</a> the cost of multiple requests. If you want the remaining speed boost, then you’re best off downloading your used Google Fonts and self-host them.</p>
<p>This is nothing new. In fact it’s been advocated already for years. Even Google themselves <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv-l3-tJgGk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=24m58s">advised others to self-host fonts</a> in their Google I/O ‘18 talk about web performance.</p>
<h2 id="self-hosting-fonts-vs-google-fonts">Self-hosting fonts vs Google Fonts</h2>
<p>By nature Google Fonts, even with all its font and CSS optimisations, can’t be faster than self-hosted fonts.</p>
<p>Sia wrote <a href="https://medium.com/clio-calliope/making-google-fonts-faster-aadf3c02a36d">a great post</a> where she compared the performance between Google Fonts and self-hosted fonts without the impact of a CDN.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="the-old-performance-argument">The old performance argument</h2>
<p>So if the bottom-line performance is in self-hosting fonts’ favour: What was the argument that convinced us developers that Google Fonts is at least as performing as the self-host approach?</p>
<p>Google Fonts was designed to be distributed on a global CDN and reap the caching benefits from it. Users request fonts via said CDN. Chances are that they have downloaded the font resources at an earlier point already from a different site.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[…] Our cross-site caching is designed so that you only need to load a font once, with any website, and we’ll use that same cached font on any other website that uses Google Fonts.”</p>
<p>— <a href="https://fonts.google.com/about">https://fonts.google.com/about</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="invalidating-the-old-performance-argument">Invalidating the old performance argument</h2>
<p>Since Chrome v86, released October 2020, cross-site resources like fonts can’t be shared on the same CDN anymore. This is due to the partitioned browser cache (Safari has had this for years already).</p>
<p>In <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/10/http-cache-partitioning">this Google post</a> they explain what the partitioned browser cache is. It got only introduced to prevent a possible cross-site tracking mechanism.</p>
<h2 id="cache-partitioning-in-other-browsers">Cache partitioning in other browsers</h2>
<p>Safari really cares about privacy. It circumvented this very cross-site tracking attack for years already. Then finally comes Chrome. Other browsers that are based off Chromium, still need to signal or implement the feature.</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ <strong>Chrome</strong>: since v86 (October 2020)</li>
<li>✅ <strong>Safari</strong>: since 2013</li>
<li>🚫 <strong>Firefox</strong>: planning to implement</li>
<li>🚫 <strong>Edge</strong>: most likely soon</li>
<li>🚫 <strong>Opera</strong>: most likely soon</li>
<li>🚫 <strong>Brave</strong>: most likely soon</li>
<li>🚫 <strong>Vivaldi</strong>: most likely soon</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Google Fonts resources will be redownloaded for every website, regardless it being cached on the CDN. Self-host your fonts for better performance. The old performance argument is not valid anymore.</p>
<p>Thanks for checking this post out!</p>

<h3>How Neobanks Should Monetize Status Signaling</h3>



<p><span>01</span> Intro</p>



<p>If you’ve been following this blog for a while, you probably know by now that one of my favorite topics to think and write about is “status signaling”.</p>



<p>Signaling explains most of our everyday actions: what clothes we wear, which universities we pick and which religion we subscribe to. Everything has a hidden signaling component with which we communicate our desired tribal affiliation.</p>



<p>In <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling-as-a-Service</a>, I described the implications signaling has on the monetization of software businesses. For many traditional industries, monetizing the display of status is not a new concept. A Rolex watch, for example, is not better at telling the time than a cheap Casio watch. But a Rolex reveals something about its owners’ wealth and, thus, their status in society. It’s that status message that explains the difference in price.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/equaltime.png"></p><p>Similarly, driving a Prius says something about your views on climate change. A <em>Make America Great Again</em> cap reveals something about your political affiliations. And Nike athletic wear signals a healthy, pro-active lifestyle.</p>



<p>Software is at a crucial disadvantage compared to these physical products because of its intangibility. A fitness app also signals a healthy, pro-active lifestyle, but no one can see it because it only lives on your phone. Everyone can see your Nike gear whenever you wear it in public. Software can’t offer the same benefit. It doesn’t have a signaling distribution channel.</p>



<p>This is why there is no software equivalent of a Rolex watch or a Louis Vuitton handbag. People aren’t willing to spend money on things other people can’t see they spent money on.</p>



<p>But it doesn’t have to be that way. As software is eating the world, the lines between physical and digital products are becoming increasingly blurry. As I have pointed out in my original essay, one way for software companies to solve the signaling distribution problem is to add a physical element to their software product.</p>



<p>In this post I want to explore this idea a little bit further. Specifically, we’ll look at neobanks – and their opportunity to monetize credit card signaling.</p>



<p><span>02</span> Neobanks</p>



<p>In the last couple of years we have witnessed the birth and rise of a new startup vertical: neobanks.</p>



<p>Neobanks differ from traditional banks in two ways:</p>



<p>1) Rather than relying on a physical branch network, the entire banking experience is managed via an app</p>



<p>2) Instead of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-q4bEULG64">“how do you do, fellow kids”</a>-cringiness that ad campaigns of traditional banks usually invoke when they try to appeal to a younger audience, neobanks are actually perceived as cool. In fact, many of them feel more like lifestyle brands than banks or tech companies.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_26qGBSGmB3yaPD7nZJrFIg.gif">



<img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/lifestylebrand-1.png"></p><p>Interestingly though, neobanks still use one very traditional banking element: physical cards.</p>



<p>At first glance, this might seem counterintuitive. If you are building a mobile-first bank, why not offer virtual cards and let users pay with their phone? Why go through the hassle of producing and shipping physical cards?</p>



<p>The answer is – you guessed it – signaling.</p>



<p>Think about it: Paying for things (offline) is a social activity. It’s an interaction between at least you and a cashier or waiter. But ideally, in a dinner scenario for example, you are surrounded by other people you want to impress: a date, a group of friends, or work colleagues.</p>



<p>This makes the moment you take out your card to pay the bill a great opportunity to make a statement and build social capital.</p>



<p>If you look at neobanks out there today, it’s pretty obvious that signaling is in fact one of the main benefits they offer – and almost the only thing they monetize <span>(apart from interchange, of course)</span>:</p>



<ul><li>The premium subscriptions neobanks offer usually don’t win on features but solely on nicer looking cards. The <a href="https://n26.com/metal">N26</a> or <a href="https://revolut.com/metal">Revolut</a> Metal plans, for example, don’t offer any additional features that <em>really</em> justify the ~€15 / month price tag. They do include a nice looking metal card though – that’s what people pay for.</li><li>Relatedly, it seems like most of the innovation in the industry is happening in card design. The actual banking products are more or less interchangeable, what differs is whether the card comes in <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">titanium</a>, <a href="https://www.treecard.org/">wood</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/cashapp/status/1290694734529400832">glow-in-the-dark yellow</a>.</li><li>You may have noticed that the credit card number has moved from the front to the back of the card. This makes it easier for users to share photos of their cards on social media as an additional signaling distribution channel.</li></ul>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nocardnumber-1.png"></p><p>Neobanks are popping up like mushrooms after the rain at the moment and it’s unlikely that this trend will end any time soon. Thanks to banking-as-a-service providers, we’ll likely see a lot of non-banking-companies add banking functionalities and cards to their product offering.</p>



<p>There’s an old Twitter joke that every app evolves until it eventually becomes a chat app. The 2020 version of that joke is that every app evolves until it eventually becomes a bank.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1295024066869567488">I did some research on credit card designs</a> recently, I was surprised by the sheer amount of different neobanks already in existance. And yet, even though almost all of them offer well-designed cards, it’s shocking how similar they all are. It seems like all of them are focusing on the same target audience instead of differentiating their signaling messages.</p>



<p>Let me explain.</p>



<p><span>03</span> In-Groups, Out-Groups and Artificial Scarcity</p>



<p>In every signaling scenario there are two possible target audiences: An in-group and an out-group.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/groups.png"></p><p>The in-group is the tribe you want to join and signal your affiliation to. The out-group is everyone else – people you want to distance yourself from.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90391587/why-we-dont-want-you-and-your-android-green-bubbles-in-our-imessage-chat">iMessage is a great illustration of this</a>: the chat bubble colors clearly indicate who belongs to the in-group (blue = iOS) and who is part of the out-group (green = Android). </p>



<p>It’s important to note that signaling in iMessage is limited to the in-group since these color codes are only visible for iOS users – Android users can’t see who in the group is using which operating system. </p>



<p>Signaling, however, grows stronger the larger the out-group is – as long as the out-group knows about the in-group. This is why luxury car manufacturers deliberately extend their advertising campaigns to people who will never be able to afford their cars: they are increasing the size of the out-group by educating people about the in-group.</p>



<p>At the same time, brands need to control the size of the in-group. The more exclusive the in-group, the higher the signaling strength and, thus, the monetization potential of a customer. </p>



<p>The easiest control mechanism for the size of the in-group is price. If you set the price high enough, few people will be able to afford the product. Ironically, this, in turn, justifies the high price.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/priceloop.png"></p><p>Alternatively, companies create artificial scarcity by setting a hard number on supply. Limited supply creates FOMO and hype which increases the size of the out-group and results in higher social status for members of the in-group. Artificial scarcity explains the price of Bitcoin, Pokémon trading cards and why people spend hours queuing in front of Supreme shops.</p>



<p>The problem with keeping the in-group small is that it also limits the number of potential customers and, thus, overall revenue potential. Companies need to walk a fine line between maximizing the number of customers while simultaneously maximizing the number of people they can (afford to) exclude.</p>



<p><span>04</span> What Neobanks Should Build</p>



<p>The problem with neobanks today is that they all focus on the same in-group. Here are the premium cards of some of the largest European challenger banks – notice any difference?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/metalcards.png"></p><p>It seems like everyone is trying to become the Apple of Banking – including <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">Apple itself</a>. The signaling messages are all about displaying economic power.</p>



<p>But we are slowly seeing new banking apps that are focusing on different audiences. For example, there are now a <a href="https://www.tomorrow.one/">handful of</a> <a href="https://blog.gohenry.com/uk/gohenry-news/meet-our-new-biodegradable-eco-card/">“green”</a> <a href="https://www.treecard.org/">neobanks</a> that help users signal environmental altruism. </p>



<p>Or how about <a href="https://www.razer.com/razer-card">this Razer Card</a> targeted at the gamer community?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/environment.png"></p><p>The question for these companies and their investors is whether the in-group is big enough to justify building an entire bank around it. Making the unit economics of a bank work requires a certain amount of users, but as we discussed earlier, the signaling strength decreases as the size of in-group increases.</p>



<p>So how do you solve this problem?<br>By introducing multiple in-groups.</p>



<p>See, the current model looks like this:</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neogroup01.png"></p><p>(In fact, given how undifferentiated most of the offerings and cards are, there are actually multiple neobanks within the same small in-group bubble.)</p>



<p>But what if one bank would target multiple, different in-groups?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neogroup02.png"></p><p>For example, what if N26 had dedicated cards for soccer fans, hip-hop enthusiasts and gamers? Instead of focusing on just one signaling audience, their total addressable market would massively increase. </p>



<p>The way they would target these audiences is via brand collaborations. N26 does not have the necessary reputation in any of the above-mentioned areas to build credible signaling messages. It would not be able to build attractive in-groups on its own – but other brands could lend N26 their social capital. </p>



<p>Apple has long worked with <a href="https://www.apple.com/lae/product-red/">RED</a>, IKEA recently <a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/virgil-abloh-ikea-collaboration-best-look/">teamed up with Virgil Abloh</a>, and <a href="https://www.headspace.com/partners/nike-partnerships">Nike partners with Headspace</a>. Why wouldn’t this concept work for neobanks?</p>



<p>What would <strong>N26 x Manchester United</strong> look like? <br>Or <strong>Chime x Supreme</strong>? <br>Or <strong>Revolut x 100 Thieves</strong>?</p>



<p>Because of a bigger target audience overall, individual in-groups could be kept smaller. Cards could be <a href="https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/scarcity-as-an-api">released as limited edition drops</a> transforming them into collectibles, which would justify a higher price tag per card.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that different signaling audiences are not mutually exclusive. We don’t just subscribe to a single in-group – our <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/09/25/is-this-real-life/">identities are prismatic</a>. This means that some users might …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week, we <a href="https://www.hkemploymentlaw.com/blog/confidentiality-agreements-can-be-unenforceable-covenants-not-to-compete/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blogged</a> about how a recent California appellate court decision effectively rendered an employee confidentiality agreement as an unenforceable covenant not to compete.</p>
<p>In a similar decision, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/19-1852.ERRATA.11-20-2020_1689000.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Whitewater West Indus., Ltd. v. Alleshouse</em></a>, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 36394, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit recently reversed a U.S. district court decision and held that under California law, an invention assignment provision signed by an employee that assigned to the employer patents developed after employment had ceased and without use of the employer’s trade secrets or confidential information violated California’s strong public policy against restraints on trade/covenants not to compete embodied in Section 16600 of the California Business and Professions Code.</p>
<p>In reaching this decision, the federal Court of Appeals rejected the argument that Section 2870(a) of the California Labor Code permits such invention assignments.</p>
<p>Section 16600 of the Business and Professions Code provides that “<em>Except as provided in this chapter, every contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business of any kind is to that extent void.</em>” There are statutory exceptions in sections 16601, 16602, and 16602.5 for restraint on trade/noncompete provisions relating to sales of businesses, dissolutions of partnerships or dissociations of a partner from a partnership, and a dissolution of a limited liability company or a termination of a member’s interest in a limited liability company, but not for noncompete provisions against former employees.</p>
<p>Section 2870(a) of the Labor Code provides that:</p>
<p><em>(a) Any provision in an employment agreement which provides that an employee shall assign, or offer to assign, any of his or her rights in an invention to his or her employer shall not apply to an invention that the employee developed entirely on his or her own time without using the employer’s equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information except for those inventions that either:</em></p>
<p><em>(1) Relate at the time of conception or reduction to practice of the invention to the employer’s business, or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the employer; or</em><br>
<em>(2) Result from any work performed by the employee for the employer.</em></p>
<p>In this case, while employed by Wave Loch, Inc., Richard Alleshouse had entered into an agreement with Wave Loch that contained the following assignment provisions:</p>
<p><em>a. Assignment: In consideration of compensation paid by Company, Employee agrees that all right, title and interest in all inventions, improvements, developments, trade-secret, copyrightable or patentable material that Employee conceives or hereafter may make or conceive, whether solely or jointly with others:</em><br>
<em>(a) with the use of Company’s time, materials, or facilities; or</em><br>
<em>(b) resulting from or suggested by Employee’s work for Company; or</em><br>
<em>(c) in any way connected to any subject matter within the existing or contemplated business of Company</em><br>
<em>shall automatically be deemed to become the property of Company as soon as made or conceived, and Employee agrees to assign to Company, its successors, assigns, or nominees, all of Employee’s rights and interests in said inventions, improvements, and developments in all countries worldwide. Employee’s obligation to assign the rights to such inventions shall survive the discontinuance or termination of this Agreement for any reason.</em></p>
<p>After Alleshouse had ceased being employed by Wave Loch, he and another party filed for and eventually were awarded three patents. Wave Loch’s successor in interest then filed suit, claiming that the invention assignment agreement had been breached by Alleshouse and that the patents should be assigned to Wave Loch’s successor. The district court agreed, and held that the agreement was valid under California law.</p>
<p>In overturning that decision, the Court of Appeals noted that the parties in the case agreed that the patented inventions had not been conceived until after Alleshouse had left Wave Loch’s employment and that no trade secrets or confidential information of Wave Loch had been used. The Court of Appeals reasoned that to give effect to the assignment provisions—which were unlimited in time and geography and would apply to a post-employment invention that was merely “suggested by” his work for Wave Loch—would significantly impair Alleshouse’s ability to work in his chosen profession.</p>
<p>The Court of Appeals then determined that the assignment provisions in Section 2870(a) of the Labor Code only applied to inventions conceived during employment. To hold otherwise, “to authoriz[e] temporally unlimited assignment requirements through its exceptions, would produce a conflict with what we think is otherwise the clear prohibition of §16600 on agreements like the one at issue here.”</p>
<p>The Court of Appeals decision is another timely reminder that courts will not enforce overbroad clauses in agreements with employees that, although not explicitly prohibiting competition, have the practical effect of doing so.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							
<h2>Why Loom?</h2>
<p>In 1998, it was amazing that the Sun Java Web Server (the precursor of Tomcat) ran each request in a separate thread, and not an OS process. It was able to serve thousands of concurrent requests this way! Nowadays, that’s not so amazing. Each thread takes up a significant amount of memory, and you can’t have millions of threads on a typical server.</p>
<p>That’s why the modern mantra of server-side programming is: “Never block!” Instead, you specify what should happen once the data is available.</p>
<p>This asynchronous programming style is great for servers, allowing them to handily support millions of concurrent requests. It isn’t so great for programmers.</p>
<p>Here is an asynchronous request with the <code>HttpClient</code> API:</p>
<pre>HttpClient.newBuilder()
   .build()
   .sendAsync(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString())
   .thenAccept(response -&gt; . . .);
   .thenApply(. . .);
   .exceptionally(. . .);
</pre>
<p>What we would normally achieve with statements is now encoded as method calls. If we loved this style of programming, we would not have statements in our programming language and merrily code in Lisp.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, code tagged as “async” is rewritten into method calls like the ones that you’ve just seen. But that means you can only call async methods from other async methods, and your API splits into a sync and an async part, forcing you to duplicate functionality.</p>

<p>Project Loom takes its guidance from languages such as Erlang and Go, attacking the root of the problem by making blocking very cheap. You run tasks in “virtual threads”, a nearly unlimited resource that is mapped into actual “carrier” threads. When a virtual thread blocks, it is “parked” and another virtual thread runs on the carrier thread. The name is supposed to remind you of virtual memory that is mapped to actual RAM.</p>
<p>Before you complain about the name, remember that naming is hard. The Loom team previously tried “fiber”, but it is already used elsewhere with a slightly different meaning. And “lightweight” or “new” thread might look foolish when something lighter-weight or newer comes along.</p>
<p>After experimenting with separate classes for OS threads and virtual threads, they ended up deciding to use a single class for both—the familiar <code>java.lang.Thread</code>—in order to ease migration.</p>
<p>Of course, good old <code>java.lang.Thread</code>, which has been around for 25 years, ever since Java 1.0, has its share of cruft. Awkward cancellation, thread groups, priorities, depreceated methods <code>stop</code>,<code>suspend</code>, <code>resume</code>. The Loom team felt that these liabilities were minor since most programmers never explicitly use the <code>Thread</code> API but launch tasks with an <code>ExecutorService</code>. (Of course, the same argument would support coming up with a cleaner virtual thread API instead.)</p>
<p>If you have been around for a very long time, you may remember that early versions of Java had “green threads” that were mapped to an OS thread. However, there is a crucial difference. When a green thread blocked, its carrier thread was also blocked, preventing all other green threads from making progress.</p>

<p>You can download binaries of Project Loom at <a href="http://jdk.java.net/loom/">http://jdk.java.net/loom/</a>. They are updated regularly.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, a virtual thread is an object of the <code>Thread</code> class. Here are three ways of producing fibers. First, there is a new factory method that constructs and starts a virtual thread:</p>
<pre>Thread thread = Thread.startVirtualThread(runnable);
  // <cite>Note that the thread is already started</cite></pre>
<p>This is good for demos, tutorials or quick-and-dirty experiments in JShell.</p>
<p>For more customization, there is a builder API:</p>
<pre>Thread thread = Thread.builder()
   .virtual()
   .name(taskname)
   .task(runnable)
   .build();</pre>
<p>However, as you have been told for many years now, it is better to use an executor service than to manually construct <code>Thread</code> instances. The static method <code>Executors.newVirtualThreadExecutor()</code> provides one. (The existing executor services are not useful for virtual threads. It would be counterproductive to pool them!)</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<pre>ExecutorService exec = Executors.newVirtualThreadExecutor();
exec.submit(runnable1);
exec.submit(runnable2);
</pre>
<p>As with the other factory methods in the <code>Executors</code> class, you can optionally supply a <code>ThreadFactory</code>. And the new <code>Thread.Builder</code> class has an easy way to provide a factory, instead of a single instance:</p>
<pre>ThreadFactory factory = Thread.builder()
   .virtual()
   .name(taskname)
   .task(runnable)
   .<b>factory()</b>;

ExecutorService exec = Executors.newThreadExecutor(factory);
</pre>
<p>Let’s try this out. As a first test, we just sleep in each task.</p>
<pre>import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class Test {
   public static int DELAY = 10_000;
   public static int NTASKS = 1_000_000;

   public static void run(Object obj) {
      try {
         Thread.sleep((int) (DELAY * Math.random()));
      } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
         ex.printStackTrace();
      }
      System.out.println(obj);
   }

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      ExecutorService exec = Executors.newVirtualThreadExecutor();
      for (int i = 1; i &lt;= NTASKS; i++) {
         String taskname = "task-" + i;
         exec.submit(() -&gt; run(taskname));
      }
      exec.close();
   }
}
</pre>
<p>Run the program and it just works. Then try using OS threads—change to <code>Executors.newCachedThreadPool()</code> or <code>Executors.newFixedThreadPool(NTASKS)</code>. The program will run out of memory; on my laptop, after about 25,000 threads.</p>
<p>Ok, but in practice, you don’t want to sleep, but do useful work. Consider a program adapted from one of <a href="https://www.javaspecialists.eu/about/heinz/">Heinz Kabutz</a>‘ puzzlers, The program fetches a daily image, from Dilbert or Wikimedia. It consists of classes <a href="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2019-07-27/dailyImages/ImageProcessor.java"><code>ImageProcessor</code></a> and <a href="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2019-07-27/dailyImages/ImageInfo.java"><code>ImageInfo</code></a>. The code is an impenetrable maze of twisty passages, all alike (i.e. helper functions yielding completable futures).</p>
<p>With virtual threads, simply read web contents synchronously. It blocks, but we don’t care. All the complexity goes away. The control flow is simple and comprehensible.</p>
<pre>exec.submit(() -&gt; {
    String pageURL = info.getUrlForDate(date);
    String page = getSync(pageURL, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
    String imageURL = info.findImage(page).getImagePath();
    byte[] image = getSync(imageURL, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofByteArray());
    info.setImageData(image);
    process(info);
    return null;
});</pre>
<p>Here is the simplified <a href="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2020-12-05/dailyImages/ImageProcessor.java"><code>ImageProcessor</code></a> code.</p>
<p><b>Pro tip: </b>The statement <code>return null;</code> makes the lambda into a <code>Callable</code> instead of a <code>Runnable</code>, so that you don’t have to catch checked exceptions 😜</p>
<p>Try this out with something you care about. Call web services and make database connections, without worrying about callbacks. When blocking is cheap, a whole lot of accidental complexity goes away. Of course, to use this in a web app framework, you’ll have to wait for your framework provider to run your code in virtual threads.</p>
<h2>Structured Concurrency</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/">this highly recommended article</a> (from which the images below are taken), Nathaniel Smith proposes structured forms of concurrency. Here is his central argument. Launching a task in a new thread is really no better than programming with GOTO, i.e. harmful:</p>
<pre>new Thread(runnable).start();</pre>
<p><img src="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2019-12-05/sequential-and-go-to-schematic.svg" alt=".svg" width="38%"></p>
<p>When multiple threads run without coordination, it’s spaghetti code all over again. In the 1960s, structured programming replaced <code>goto</code> with branches, loops, and functions:</p>
<p><img src="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2019-12-05/control-schematics.svg" alt=".svg" width="42%"></p>
<p>When you look at a line of code, you know how the program got there.</p>
<p>Structured concurrency does the same for concurrent tasks. We should know, from reading the program text, when they all finish.</p>
<p><img src="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2019-12-05/nursery-schematic-unlabeled.svg" alt=".svg" width="30%"></p>
<p>That way we can control the resources that the tasks use, and we know when it is time to move on.</p>
<p>In Loom, the <code>ExecutorService</code> implements this basic construct. <code>ExecutorService</code> has a <code>close</code> method that blocks until all of its virtual threads have completed. (I used this method in the first sample program to keep <code>main</code> alive until all virtual threads are done. In the past, you had to call the <code>awaitTermination</code> method instead.)</p>
<p>Conveniently, <code>ExecutorService</code> implements the <code>AutoCloseable</code> interface, so that you can just use a <code>try</code>-with-resources statement:</p>
<pre>try (ExecutorService exec = Executor.newVirtualThreadExecutor()) {
   for (int i = 0; i &lt; NTASKS; i++) {
      exec.schedule(() -&gt; run(i));
   }
} // <cite>Blocks until all threads completed</cite>
</pre>
<p>I wrote a simple web crawler as a demonstration of virtual threads—here is the <a href="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2020-12-05/Crawler.java"><code>Crawler</code></a> class. In my first attempt, I fired off a new virtual thread for each URL in a page. If I had wanted to become Google, I could have let my crawler run forever. But I wanted to go no more than 3 hops from the starting point. With “fire and forget”, there is no way of knowing when the recursion is done.</p>
<p>Instead, for each page, I make a new executor service and wait for completion. That way, the whole program completes when all pages have been crawled.</p>
<p>This seems a lot of blocking. But in Loom, blocking is cheap, so we shouldn’t worry about that.</p>
<p>We are used to having one executor service as thread pool for all our tasks. But in Loom, you are encouraged to use a separate executor service for each task set.</p>
<h2>Deadlines</h2>
<p>When crawling the web, you are likely to encounter dead links. Reading from one should time out eventually, but it can take surprisingly long.</p>
<p>The standard remedy is, of course, to provide a timeout. Loom prefers deadlines to timeouts, so you specify</p>
<pre>ExecutorService exec = Executors.newVirtualThreadExecutor().withDeadline(
   Instant.now().plus(30, ChronoUnit.SECONDS))
</pre>
<p>Why deadlines? In general, timeouts compose poorly. Suppose you have to accomplish two sequential tasks with an overall timeout of 10 seconds. You don’t want to give each of the tasks a timeout of 5 seconds. After all, if one takes 6 seconds and the other 3 seconds, you still come in under the finish line. To get the timeout of the second task, you’d have to measure the duration of the first task and subtract that from the overall timeout. With deadlines, it is much simpler. Each task gets the same deadline.</p>
<p>The call <code>exec.close()</code> blocks until all virtual threads have completed or the …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>C# 9 brings lots of new language features. One of them is the ability to suppress emitting <code>.locals init</code> flag. This feature allows to improve the performance of a method by not zeroing the local variables before executing the method. Even if <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/32538">zeroing local has been improved<i></i></a> in .NET 5, not doing it will still be faster.</p><h2 id="what-is-locals-init"><a href="#what-is-locals-init">#</a>What is locals init?</h2><p>By default, the C# compiler emits the <code>.locals init</code> directive. This instructs the JIT to generate a prolog to set all local variables to their default value. This is safer as you cannot use uninitialized memory. You can validate this behavior using unsafe code. The following method constantly prints "0" to the console as the JIT initializes the variable <code>i</code> to its default value.</p><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>unsafe</span> <span><span>void</span></span> <span>DemoZeroing</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>It was only when I recently heard someone else say, “git stash is scary” that I realized it was top of my list of fears too. It just usually feels like there’s a chance I’ll just lose all of my in progress work to the depths of stashes and never be able to get the right incantation of <code>git</code> commands to reincarnate my code.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-git-stash-do">What does git stash do?</h3>

<p>Let me backtrack a minute! I haven’t yet explained what <code>git stash</code> even does. On the most basic level, <code>git stash</code> is one way to store in progress work in <code>git</code> for subsequent access, leaving behind a clean working directory.</p>

<p><em>Meta-note</em>: this post will be easiest to follow along if you open up a terminal and play around with <code>git stash</code> as you’re reading! The lack of syntax highlighting makes it a little tricky to see git additions / deletions. You can play around with any git repo you have, or clone <a href="https://github.com/githubtraining/hellogitworld">this hello world one</a> locally to work in a complete sandbox!</p>

<h3 id="stacks">Stacks</h3>

<p>Stashes are more easily understood as a basic last in, first out stack.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>git stash push</code> (equivalent to <code>git stash</code> when used with no arguments) will push any local changes onto the stash and leave a clean working directory.</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to <span>date </span>with <span>'origin/main'</span><span>.</span>

Changes not staged <span>for </span>commit:
  <span>(</span>use <span>"git add &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to update what will be committed<span>)</span>
  <span>(</span>use <span>"git restore &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to discard changes <span>in </span>working directory<span>)</span>
	modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit <span>(</span>use <span>"git add"</span> and/or <span>"git commit -a"</span><span>)</span>

<span>$ </span>git stash push

<span>$ </span>git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to <span>date </span>with <span>'origin/main'</span><span>.</span>

nothing to commit, working tree clean

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are a plethora of arguments we can pass to <code>git stash push</code>. The ones I find most helpful are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>-m &lt;message&gt;</code> saves the stash with a message, can be helpful for our future selves</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash push <span>-m</span> <span>"description"</span>
Saved working directory and index state On main: description
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>-p</code> patches changes (used like <code>git add -p</code>), allowing us to select which hunks to add to the stash. <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/manual/html_node/Detailed-Unified.html">Hunks</a> are areas where two files differ. Git will partition files into hunks for us!</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash push <span>-p</span>
....
Details about the hunk
....
<span>(</span>1/1<span>)</span> Stash this hunk <span>[</span>y,n,q,a,d,e,?]?
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>-u</code> includes untracked files in the stash. Without this flag, a file that <code>git</code> had never seen before would not be included in a stash</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>touch </span>new-file
<span>$ </span>git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to <span>date </span>with <span>'origin/main'</span><span>.</span>

Untracked files:
  <span>(</span>use <span>"git add &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to include <span>in </span>what will be committed<span>)</span>
	new-file

nothing added to commit but untracked files present <span>(</span>use <span>"git add"</span> to track<span>)</span>

<span>$ </span>git stash push <span>-u</span>
Saved working directory and index state WIP on main: 6ab43aa Initial commit
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>-k</code> keeps the files (or hunks) which were staged. Without this option, when we apply a stash, nothing will be staged. More on applying in the next section!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="accessing-the-stash">Accessing the stash</h3>

<p>Okay, we can now push changes onto the stash. But…. they’re still the stash abyss if we have no way of accessing them.</p>

<p><code>git stash list</code> shows us what is on the stash:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash list
stash@<span>{</span>0<span>}</span>: On main: Clear description of these changes
stash@<span>{</span>1<span>}</span>: WIP on main: 6ab43aa Initial commit
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is where the <code>-m</code> message flag from earlier will be incredibly helpful. The first item in my stash had a message (<code>Clear description of these changes</code>), the second did not.</p>

<p>Okay, okay. We can now <em>see</em> what’s on the stash. But how do we access anything on the stash? Or remove it from the stash?</p>

<p><code>git stash show</code> will show us the difference between the top item on the stash, and our current working directory:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash show
 README.md | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion<span>(</span>+<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we want to reference a different set of changes on the stash, and not the most recent one, we can use the stash index of those changes. As we can see above, each item on the stash has an index, and can be referred to by <code>stash@{index}</code></p>

<p>So, to see the set of changes in the next item on our stack, we can run:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash show stash@<span>{</span>1<span>}</span>
 README.md | 2 +-
 1 file changed, 1 insertion<span>(</span>+<span>)</span>, 1 deletion<span>(</span>-<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Neat, so we now know how to get the differences and look at what’s in the stash. But to actually access what’s on the stash, we’ll need <code>git stash apply [&lt;stash&gt;]</code>. It similarly can take an argument with the stash index to reference something later in the stash. If no argument is provided, it will default to the most recent set of changes we put in the stash (the ones at <code>stash@{0}</code>)</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash apply stash@<span>{</span>1<span>}</span>
On branch main
Your branch is up to <span>date </span>with <span>'origin/main'</span><span>.</span>

Changes not staged <span>for </span>commit:
  <span>(</span>use <span>"git add &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to update what will be committed<span>)</span>
  <span>(</span>use <span>"git restore &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to discard changes <span>in </span>working directory<span>)</span>
	modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit <span>(</span>use <span>"git add"</span> and/or <span>"git commit -a"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="removing-from-the-stash">Removing from the stash</h4>

<p>However, <code>git stash apply</code> will not <em>remove</em> the changes from the stash. If we look at the stash now, we’ll see it’s the same as it was:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash list
stash@<span>{</span>0<span>}</span>: On main: Clear description of these changes
stash@<span>{</span>1<span>}</span>: WIP on main: 6ab43aa Initial commit
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In order to remove a set of changes from the stash, we can use <code>git stash drop [&lt;stash&gt;]</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash drop stash@<span>{</span>0<span>}</span>
Dropped refs/stash@<span>{</span>0<span>}</span> <span>(</span>b09812812eb27de2cb49bfd02aba43889362b6de<span>)</span>

<span>$ </span>git stash list
stash@<span>{</span>0<span>}</span>: WIP on main: 6ab43aa Initial commit
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see that the set of changes at <code>stash@{0}</code> are now no longer on the stash, and the set of changes which were at <code>stash@{1}</code> are now at <code>stash@{0}</code>.</p>

<p>If we want to <code>apply</code> and <code>drop</code> a set of changes, we can conveniently use <code>git stash pop [&lt;stash&gt;]</code>. <code>pop</code> will only also <code>drop</code> if there’s no merge conflict.</p>

<p>To clear the stash completely, we can run <code>git stash clear</code>. This is the <em>actual</em> scary command which will cause us to lose any work in progress that you had stashed. Only run <code>git stash clear</code> if you never again want to access what is currently on the stash.</p>

<h3 id="why-stash">Why stash?</h3>

<p>So we’ve learned how to use <code>git stash</code>, but still haven’t covered <em>why</em> to use it. Stashing is intended to be a quick and easy way to get to a clean working state while not losing in progress work. And it is! Both quick, and now hopefully easy!</p>

<p>One example of when I might use <code>git stash</code> is if I’m in progress on some changes, but realize I want to amend a prior commit. I can stash the changes, amend the commit, and then apply the stash to get back to where I was.</p>

<p>Another is if I am trying to experiment with a few different ways to solve a problem, and want small, quick examples down each solution path. I might create stashes with all of my examples, and then pick the best and pursue that set of changes in a branch structure.</p>

<p>Additionally, stashing is especially helpful because it is branch agnostic. That is to say, if we switch branches, our stash will remain the same. This means stashing can also be a convenient way to carry changes through different branches.</p>

<h3 id="when-not-to-stash">When not to stash</h3>

<p>Equally import to why stash is when <em>not</em> to use it.</p>

<p>Stashing was built for convenience, and is not intended to be a permanent way to save work; that’s what branches and commits are for. Stashing also only works locally, you can’t push stashes to a repo or have others pull them down.</p>

<h3 id="branches-from-stash">Branches from stash</h3>

<p>Speaking of branches, another fun feature of stashes is that we can create a branch directly from a stash. This is done using <code>git stash branch &lt;branch_name&gt; [&lt;stash&gt;]</code> This will also drop the changes from the stash, equivalent to a <code>git stash pop</code> not a <code>git stash apply</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>git stash</code> operates on a LIFO stack of sets of changes</li>
  <li><code>git stash list</code> shows what’s on the stash</li>
  <li><code>git stash push</code> pushes to the stash</li>
  <li><code>git stash apply</code> access changes on the stash</li>
  <li><code>git stash drop</code> removes changes from the stash</li>
  <li><code>git stash pop</code> does an <code>apply</code> and a <code>drop</code></li>
  <li>These default to the most recent item on the stash, to reference another one use <code>stash@{index}</code> where you can determine the index from <code>git stash list</code></li>
  <li>Some of these have flags which make them more convenient, including: <code>-m</code> message, <code>-p</code> patch, <code>-u</code> include untracked files, <code>-k</code> keep staged changes staged</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully you, too, can now add <code>git stash</code> to the list of fears you’ve conquered!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Ah, it’s again this magical time of the year - the Advent!
When I was little I associated it mostly with advent candy boxes
with a different candy for each day of the Advent, but these days
I mostly associate this period with the famous <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>As much as I love solving puzzles, I’ve realized lately that probably
it’s not the best use of my limited free time. Last year I opted to do
an <a href="http://metaredux.com/posts/2019/12/01/meta-advent-2019.html">blogging challenge</a>, instead of the Advent of Code, and this
year I’m challenging myself to contribute something (meaningful) to my <a href="http://metaredux.com/projects">open-source
projects</a> every day from the 1st of December to Christmas.
Fun times ahead!</p>

<p>Today is the 3rd of December already, so I guess I have to report what I’ve done so far.</p>

<h2 id="dec-1">Dec 1</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Shipped <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/releases/tag/v1.5.0">RuboCop 1.5</a></li>
  <li>Lots of improvements to the <a href="https://guide.clojure.style/">Clojure Style Guide</a>
    <ul>
      <li>New sections on <a href="https://guide.clojure.style/#guiding-principles">guiding principles</a> and <a href="https://guide.clojure.style/#a-note-about-consistency">consistency</a></li>
      <li>Documented the <a href="https://guide.clojure.style/#sources-of-inspiration">sources of inspiration</a></li>
      <li>Added lots of new code examples (e.g. <a href="https://guide.clojure.style/#comments">here</a>)</li>
      <li>Fixed many headings that had broken wording after the automated conversion to the current structure last year (each guideline now has a title, and the titles were auto-generated from the old permalinks associated with the guidelines)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I hope to gradually clean up the backlog for improvements of the style guide in the months to come. I’ll also mention here that I wouldn’t mind
some volunteers willing to help document the best practices for working with <code>cljc</code> and <code>clojure.spec</code>.</p>

<h2 id="dec-2">Dec 2</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Shipped <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/releases/tag/v1.5.1">RuboCop 1.5.1</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile">Projectile</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Groomed the backlog (replied to some tickets, closed some tickets that were addressed/irrelevant, added tags to everything else)</li>
      <li>Merged a few outstanding PRs (see the <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#bugs-fixed">changelog</a> for details)</li>
      <li>Lots of improvements to the documentation site
        <ul>
          <li>Improved <a href="https://docs.projectile.mx/projectile/usage.html">Usage</a> page (better basic setup instructions, plus coverage of the mighty but elusive Projectile Commander)</li>
          <li>Improved <a href="https://docs.projectile.mx/projectile/projects.html">Projects</a> page (in particular, you’ll find there a lot of information about the mythical and mystical <code>projectile-project-root-functions</code>)</li>
          <li>Improved <a href="https://docs.projectile.mx/projectile/configuration.html">Configuration</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It always feels great to revisit Projectile, as it’s both the first open-source project I ever created and the project I use more than anything else.</p>

<h2 id="dec-3-today">Dec 3 (today)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>More work on Projectile’s documentation and grooming the backlog</li>
  <li>Preparing for another RuboCop bug-fix release (1.5.2 might land later today)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward</h2>

<p>So, what’s next?
My main priorities for the Advent of OSS are currently:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Polish the Clojure Style Guide</li>
  <li>Ship CIDER 1.0</li>
  <li>Ship Emacs Prelude 1.1</li>
  <li>Clean up Projectile’s backlog</li>
</ul>

<p>I probably won’t be able to achieve them all, but I’ve been told it’s good to be ambitious. If someone wants to help me out, be my guest.
My projects have plenty of tickets tagged with <code>Good First Issue</code> that you might try tackling.</p>

<p>I’ll try to post some updates here every few days, both to keep it
up-to-date with my progress and to keep myself honest. That’s all from
me for now. Keep hacking!</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> In the time-honored tradition of the Advent, I’m inviting all of you to join my on the Christmas OSS adventure and see how far are you willing
to go! It will be fun!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Postgres database is rich with features well beyond that of any other
database. However, most developers do not know the extent to which they can
leverage the features in Postgres to completely express their application
business logic in the database.</p>
<p>Often developers may find themselves re-implementing authentication and
authorization in their apps, when Postgres comes with application level security
features out of the box. Or perhaps developers may rewrite basic insert
functions with some extra app logic where that too may be handled in the
database.</p>
<p>This reimplementation of features that come with Postgres is not just an
inefficient way to spend developer resources, but may also result in an
interface that is slower than if the logic was implemented in Postgres itself.
PostGraphile aims to make developers more efficient and their APIs faster by
packaging the repeatable work in one open source project that encourages
community contributions.</p>
<p>In this tutorial we will walk through the Postgres schema design for a forum
application with users who can login and write forum posts. While we will
discuss how you can use the schema we create with PostGraphile, this article
should be useful for anyone designing a Postgres schema.</p>
<p>If you haven't installed PostGraphile already, you can follow our
<a href="https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/quick-start-guide/">Quick Start Guide</a> to get PostGraphile up and
running.</p>

<h4 id="setting-up-your-schemas"><a href="#setting-up-your-schemas" aria-label="setting up your schemas permalink"></a>Setting Up Your Schemas</h4>
<p>All of our database objects will go into one or two custom Postgres schemas. A
schema is essentially a namespace, it allows you to create tables with the same
name like <code>a.person</code> and <code>b.person</code>.</p>
<p>You can name your schema anything, we recommend naming your schema after your
app. This way if you are working on multiple apps in the same database (this
might only realistically happen in development), you can easily query the
databases of the different apps. We are going to create two schemas:
<code>forum_example</code>, and <code>forum_example_private</code>. To create these schemas we use the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createschema.html"><code>CREATE SCHEMA</code></a>
command.</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>create</span> <span>schema</span> forum_example<span>;</span>
<span>create</span> <span>schema</span> forum_example_private<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You could create more or less schemas, it is all up to you and how you want to
structure your database. We decided to create two schemas. One of which,
<code>forum_example</code>, is meant to hold data users can see, whereas
<code>forum_example_private</code> will never be directly accessible to users.</p>
<p>Theoretically we want a user to be able to log in directly to our Postgres
database, and only be able to create, read, update, and delete data for their
user all within SQL. This is a mindshift from how we traditionally use a SQL
database. Normally, we assume whoever is querying the database has full
visibility into the system as the only one with database access is our
application. In this tutorial, we want to restrict access at the database level.
Don’t worry though! Postgres is very secure about this, users will have no more
permissions than that which you explicitly grant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When starting PostGraphile, you will want to use the name of the
schema you created with the <code>--schema</code> option, like so:
<code>postgraphile --schema forum_example</code>. Also, don’t forget to add the <code>--watch</code>
flag, with watch mode enabled PostGraphile will update your API as we add
tables and types throughout this tutorial.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="the-person-table"><a href="#the-person-table" aria-label="the person table permalink"></a>The Person Table</h4>
<p>Now we are going to create the tables in our database which will correspond to
our users. We will do this by running the Postgres
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createtable.html"><code>CREATE TABLE</code></a>
command. Here is the definition for our person table:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>create</span> <span>table</span> forum_example<span>.</span>person <span>(</span>
  id               <span>serial</span> <span>primary</span> <span>key</span><span>,</span>
  first_name       <span>text</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span> <span>check</span> <span>(</span>char_length<span>(</span>first_name<span>)</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>80</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
  last_name        <span>text</span> <span>check</span> <span>(</span>char_length<span>(</span>last_name<span>)</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>80</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
  about            <span>text</span><span>,</span>
  created_at       <span>timestamp</span> <span>default</span> <span>now</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we have created a table with <code>id</code>, <code>first_name</code>, <code>last_name</code>, <code>about</code>, and
<code>created_at</code> columns (we will add an <code>updated_at</code> column later). Let’s break
down exactly what each line in this command does, we will only do this once. If
you already understand, you can skip ahead.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>create table forum_example.person</code>: This tells Postgres that we are
creating a table in the <code>forum_example</code> schema named <code>person</code>. This table
will represent all of our forum’s users.</li>
<li><code>id serial primary key</code>: This line establishes an auto-incrementing id field
which is always guaranteed to be unique. The first person we create will
have an id of 1, the second user will have an id of 2, and so on. The
<code>primary key</code> bit is also very important. PostGraphile will use the
<code>primary key</code> of a table in many places to uniquely identify an object,
including the globally unique id field.</li>
<li><code>first_name text not null check (char_length(first_name) &lt; 80)</code>: We want all
of our users to enter their first name and last name seperately, so this
column definition will create a column named <code>first_name</code>, of type <code>text</code>,
that is required (<code>not null</code>), and that must be less than 80 characters long
(<code>check (char_length(first_name) &lt; 80)</code>).
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/ddl-constraints.html">Check constraints</a>
are a very powerful feature in Postgres for data validation.</li>
<li><code>last_name text check (char_length(last_name) &lt; 80)</code>: This is very similar
to our column definition for <code>first_name</code>, except it is missing <code>not null</code>.
This means that unlike the <code>first_name</code> column, <code>last_name</code> is not required.</li>
<li><code>about text</code>: We want users to be able to express themselves! So they get to
write a mini forum post which will go on their profile page.</li>
<li><code>created_at timestamp default now()</code>: This final column definition will
provide us with some extra meta-information about their user. If not
specified explicitly, the <code>created_at</code> timestamp will default to the time
the row was inserted.</li>
</ol>
<p>And that’s our person table! Pretty simple, right?</p>
<p>The syntax and features of the Postgres
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createtable.html"><code>CREATE TABLE</code></a>
command are fairly easy to learn and understand. Creating tables is the easiest,
but also the most fundamental part of your schema design.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> We prefer singular identifers like <code>forum_example.person</code> over
<code>forum_example.people</code> because when you create a table, it is like you are
creating a class in a statically typed language. Classes have singular names
like “Person” while collections will often have plural names like “People.”
Table as a class is a better analogy than table as a collection because
Postgres itself will internally call tables “classes.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In case you don’t like serial id of our table above, an alternative
to the <code>serial</code> primary key is UUIDs. To use UUIDs you would just need to add
the popular UUID extension, <code>uuid-ossp</code>, in your database setup, and specify a
default in your table creation. Like so:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>create</span> extension <span>if</span> <span>not</span> <span>exists</span> <span>"uuid-ossp"</span><span>;</span>

<span>create</span> <span>table</span> forum_example<span>.</span>person <span>(</span>
  id uuid <span>primary</span> <span>key</span> <span>default</span> uuid_generate_v1mc<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Alternatively you could use fully random UUIDs:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>create</span> extension <span>if</span> <span>not</span> <span>exists</span> <span>"pgcrypto"</span><span>;</span>

<span>create</span> <span>table</span> forum_example<span>.</span>person <span>(</span>
  id uuid <span>primary</span> <span>key</span> <span>default</span> gen_random_uuid<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are pros and cons to both approaches, choose what works best for your
application!</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="table-documentation"><a href="#table-documentation" aria-label="table documentation permalink"></a>Table Documentation</h4>
<p>Now that we have created our table, we want to document it within the Postgres
database. By adding comments to our table and its columns using the Postgres
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-comment.html"><code>COMMENT</code></a>
command, we will allow tools like PostGraphile to display rich domain specific
documentation.</p>
<p>To add comments, just see the SQL below:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>comment</span> <span>on</span> <span>table</span> forum_example<span>.</span>person <span>is</span> <span>'A user of the forum.'</span><span>;</span>
<span>comment</span> <span>on</span> <span>column</span> forum_example<span>.</span>person<span>.</span>id <span>is</span> <span>'The primary unique identifier for the person.'</span><span>;</span>
<span>comment</span> <span>on</span> <span>column</span> forum_example<span>.</span>person<span>.</span>first_name <span>is</span> <span>'The person’s first name.'</span><span>;</span>
<span>comment</span> <span>on</span> <span>column</span> forum_example<span>.</span>person<span>.</span>last_name <span>is</span> <span>'The person’s last name.'</span><span>;</span>
<span>comment</span> <span>on</span> <span>column</span> forum_example<span>.</span>person<span>.</span>about <span>is</span> <span>'A short description about the user, written by the user.'</span><span>;</span>
<span>comment</span> <span>on</span> <span>column</span> forum_example<span>.</span>person<span>.</span>created_at <span>is</span> <span>'The time this person was created.'</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Incredibly simple, yet also incredibly powerful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Feel free to write your comments in Markdown! Most tools, including
GraphiQL which PostGraphile uses, will render your comments with the
appropriate styles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this we have completed our person table, now let’s create a table for our
forum posts.</p>
<h4 id="the-post-table"><a href="#the-post-table" aria-label="the post table permalink"></a>The Post Table</h4>
<p>The users of our forum will want to be able to create posts. That’s the entire
reason we have a forum after all. To create the post table we go through a very
similar process as creating our <code>forum_example.person</code> table, but first we want
to create a type we will use in one of the columns. See the SQL below:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>create</span> <span>type</span> forum_example<span>.</span>post_topic <span>as</span> <span>enum</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>'discussion'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>'inspiration'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>'help'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>'showcase'</span>
<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The Postgres
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createtype.html"><code>CREATE TYPE</code></a>
command will let you create a custom type in your database which will allow you
to do some really cool things. You can create a
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/rowtypes.html">composite type</a>
which is basically a typed object in GraphQL terms, you can create a
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/rangetypes.html">range type</a>
which represents exactly what you might think, or you can create an
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/datatype-enum.html">enum type</a>
which is what we did here.</p>
<p>Enum types are a static set of values, you <em>must</em> use one of the string values
that make up the enum in any column of the enum’s type. Having this type is
useful for us, because we want our forum posts to have one, or none, topics so
user’s may easily see what a post is about.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> PostGraphile implements custom handling for user-defined types. An
enum type like that defined above will be turned into a GraphQL enum that
looks like:</p>
<div data-language="graphql"><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>PostTopic</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>DISCUSSION</span>
  <span>INSPIRATION</span>
  <span>HELP</span>
  <span>SHOWCASE</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can also create custom composite types which will turn into GraphQL object
types with PostGraphile.</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>create</span> <span>type</span> my_schema<span>.</span>my_type <span>as</span> <span>(</span>
  foo <span>integer</span><span>,</span>
  bar <span>integer</span>
<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Would become the following GraphQL type:</p>
<div data-language="graphql"><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>MyType</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>foo</span><span>:</span> Int
  <span>bar</span><span>:</span> Int
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
</blockquote>
<p>Now it is time to actually create our post table:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>create</span> <span>table</span> …</code></pre></div></div></div>

file on my desktop. And at the end of the day, I would delete that file and
start over again the next day. Inspired by the minimalism of <a href="https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt-cli">todo-txt-cli</a>,
I created a similar system to manage my own notes.</p><p>Keep reading for more details or skip to the code: <a href="https://github.com/hachibu/note.sh">github.com/hachibu/note.sh</a>.</p><h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4><p>As I mentioned before, I used to keep a single notes file on my desktop, and I
would delete it everyday. I would use this notes file to keep track of random
thoughts and details related to my work and personal life. My notes file might
contain code snippets from work, inspirational quotes, or it might have my
latest and greatest open-source software idea, or maybe even the beginning of a
new blog post. Anyway, I loved the simplicity of it, and I didn’t want any more
apps, databases or logins in my life.</p><p>But it wasn’t until I started using <a href="https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt-cli">todo-txt-cli</a>
that I considered writing a script to manage my own notes. The brilliant part
about <code>todo-txt-cli</code> is that it’s just text files stored in my Dropbox and a
small shell script to interface with those files.</p><p>Inspired by the minimalism of <code>todo-txt-cli</code>, I built <a href="https://github.com/hachibu/note.sh">note.sh</a>.
In total, the entire project consists of 1 Bash script, 1 environment variable

<code>/usr/local/bin</code> directory.</p><h4 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h4><p>The way it works is that every time I run the script, it opens the note for that
day in my editor of choice. For example, if today was December 2, 2020 then the
script would open a file named <code>2020-12-02.md</code> in the notes directory.</p><p>I use Vim as my editor, and I have my notes stored on Dropbox so I can access
them on all of my computers. So, my shell RC file looks like this.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>export</span> <span>EDITOR</span><span>=</span><span>"vim"</span>
<span>export</span> <span>NOTE_DIR</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$HOME</span><span>/Dropbox/Notes"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>And my Dropbox directory looks like this.</p><p><img src="https://hachibu.net/posts/2020/how-i-manage-my-random-daily-notes/images/dropbox-screenshot.png" alt="Dropbox Screenshot"></p><p>For searching, the script accepts a pattern and runs a recursive grep over the
notes directory. I chose grep because I use this script on both Mac and Linux,
and I wanted the script to be as portable as possible.</p><h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4><p>I’ve been using this script for several months across several computers, and I
still love it. I don’t search as often as I thought I would, but it’s comforting
to know it’s all there if I need it. I also ended up creating an alias for my
script so all I need to type is the letter <code>n</code> to run the script.</p><p>In the future, I’d like to add a test suite to the code base, figure out how
to create a Homebrew formula, and add archiving for older notes.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>This is the first part of a three part (II, III) look at the Dothraki, the fictional horse-borne nomads of the <em>Game of Thrones</em> / <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> series and the degree to which George R.R. Martin’s claim that they are “an amalgam of a number of steppe and plains cultures” holds up to scrutiny.  This is something that I have been suggesting I would get to since (checks notes),<a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/05/04/new-acquisitions-that-dothraki-charge/"> May.  Of Last Year.</a>  So it is about time we actually get to it.</p>



<p>The plan is for this series to run in three parts.  Part I (this part) will discuss how the Dothraki <em>look</em> in the setting.  Part II will look at broader questions of social organization and culture (I am nearly certain this is one of those cases where there will be a IIa and a IIb, but my hope for brevity springs eternal).  Part III will look at military culture.  In all three parts I am going to use both the books and the show – noting where they diverge – in part because the heaviest characterization the Dothraki got in the show was when Martin was still significantly involved with it (meaning that large parts of it likely still reflect his vision), but also because the show is how the vast majority of people experience this particular fiction.  Both the original text and the show derived from it deserve to have their vision discussed.</p>



<p>As always, if you like what you are reading here, please share it; if you really like it, you can support me on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreon</a>. And if you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click below for email updates or follow me on twitter (@BretDevereaux) for updates as to new posts as well as my occasional ancient history, foreign policy or military history musings.</p>






<p>First, a <strong>content warning for this series</strong>: this is discussing <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> and <em>Game of Thrones</em> which features a lot of content which is not G-rated.  More to the point, it is a discussion of what – I will argue – Martin presents as one of, if not the most brutal and sexually violent society in that setting.  And that means those themes are going to come up here (less in this essay, but more in the other parts); we are going to remain serious and adult about those things of course, but they will be a part of this analysis nonetheless.  If that is not for you, by all means feel free to check out for a few weeks.</p>



<p>Before we get into the main point, <strong>I want to note that I am going to reference my series on the <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/01/17/collections-the-fremen-mirage-part-i-war-at-the-dawn-of-civilization/">Fremen Mirage</a> <em>a lot</em> here</strong>, because there is a lot of Fremen stuff going on with how Dothraki society is depicted.  As a result, it may be useful to go back and read those, but just to recap, we may define the Fremen Mirage this way:</p>



<p><a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/02/21/collections-the-fremen-mirage-interlude-ways-of-the-fremen/"><strong>The Fremen Mirage is a literary trope, <em>unconnected to historical reality</em>, which presents societies as a contrast between unsophisticated, but morally pure, hyper-masculine and militarily effective ‘strong men’ societies honed by ‘hard times’ (that is, the Fremen of the term) and a sophisticated but effeminate and decadent ‘weak men’ societies weakened by ‘good times,’ frequently with an implicit assertion of the superior worth of the former.</strong></a></p>



<p>Next, a note on citation here from the books.  My understanding is that different printings of the books have different pagination, which seems to be why the Wiki of Ice and Fire cites by chapter numbers (except that the chapters of the books, as printed, <em>aren’t numbered</em> in the print editions I’ve seen, making this classical-style citation extremely cumbersome and inexact).  I am going to cite by the page numbers of my edition, which is the 2011 Bantam Books Trade Paperback Edition (the box set).  Hopefully that will be enough.</p>



<p>Finally, a note on my expertise here.  <strong>I am not a scholar of either the peoples of the Eurasian Steppe or the American Great Plains</strong>.  The former group does intrude into my period and study, as steppe nomads, in the form of Scythians, Sarmatians and Huns did interact (sometimes peacefully, sometimes violently) with the broader Mediterranean world.  Consequently, my knowledge of steppe peoples tend to be better that my knowledge of the Native American peoples of the Great Plains, but I have tried, within the limits of time and availability, to do my research. <strong> I actually think, in a strange sense, this is useful, because my own initial unfamiliarity with the topic has demonstrated to me just how <em>basic</em> the level of research and reading necessary to avoid the failures of this depiction are</strong>.  You do not, in turns out, need to be an experienced scholar on the topic; just a few books and a couple of emails is enough to already radically improve on what we see and read in <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>, much less the absolute <em>mess </em>of what we see in <em>A Game of Thrones</em>.</p>



<p>Writing this has been tricky.  I am well aware that both of these broad cultural groups (that is, Steppe peoples and Plains Native Americans) are often represented in popular culture only in the form of inaccurate and demeaning stereotypes.  I do not want to be just another link in that chain of poor understanding.  I have thus tried to root my argument here, wherever possible, in either the writings of specialist scholars (there will be more of that next week as we get into subsistence patterns, warfare, etc.) or primary evidence, particularly in terms of <em>period photographs</em>, when it comes to clothing and dress.  With luck I have not erred overmuch.</p>

<h2>…But, Why?</h2>



<p>But before we get into the issue proper, it is important to clear away the standard objections, both why subject <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> (and its spin-off properties) to critical analysis at all and also why, if we are going to do that, we are going to focus squarely in on the Dothraki.  The answer to the first is something that we’ve rehearsed a number of times, but bears restating: for most of its readers (and the watchers of <em>A Game of Thrones</em>), <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> will be their primary exposure to the idea of the Middle Ages.  This is particularly true because of the reputation that the series has for being ‘<a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/05/28/new-acquisitions-not-how-it-was-game-of-thrones-and-the-middle-ages-part-i/">how it really was</a>,’ a reputation that George R.R. Martin has consciously cultivated (as with his classic complaint of <a href="https://youtu.be/p-VxvKoDFIw">‘what was Aragorn’s tax policy’</a> – there is a rich irony that, had Martin understood rulership in the Middle Ages better, he would have understood why Aragorn’s tax policy was less important).  Martin has been quite open that he “<a href="https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/6040/">draw[s] inspiration from history</a>” and that fact has long been a selling point of the series over more obviously fantastical kinds of medieval-themed high fantasy as well as a <a href="https://ew.com/article/2015/06/03/george-rr-martin-thrones-violence-women/">response to some of the series’ more controversial moments</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Naturally, that cloak of verisimilitude has tended to intensify the degree to which elements of <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> is taken by its readers and viewers as representative of the Middle Ages more generally.</strong>  And of course as I have noted in the (quite recent) past,<strong> <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/11/20/miscellanea-my-thoughts-on-assassins-creed-valhalla/">fiction is often how the public conceptualizes the past and that concept of the past shapes the decisions we make in the present</a></strong>.  In the case of <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> in particular, this vision of the past is <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/06/12/new-acquisitions-how-it-wasnt-game-of-thrones-and-the-middle-ages-part-iii/">particularly worth interrogating</a> because it serves as the basis for a<a href="https://youtu.be/ek2O6bVAIQQ"> parable on power and violence</a>.</p>



<p>But <em>even if it didn’t</em>, it would still be worth discussing these aspects of the universe of <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>, because that is what we are supposed to do with cultural products, with <em>literature</em>.  <strong>I am sometimes baffled that the very fans who insist that their particular loves be treated seriously, as <em>art</em> are the same fans who react with frustration if one then sets out to interrogate those same genres the way one would interrogate serious art or literature</strong>.  This is it, after all!  This is what you (we, really) wanted!  A (quite unimpressive, I’ll grant you) ivory tower academic is taking this genre seriously and subjecting it to serious criticism!  Isn’t that what emerging genres often hope for, to be taken seriously as ‘high’ literature?</p>



<p><strong>And of course we should take it seriously.</strong>  And here I want to speak briefly to the purpose of these sorts of endeavors, <strong>because the goal here is not to force anyone to dislike <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em></strong>.   We’re not here to ‘cancel’ <em>ASOIF</em> any more than we were going to ‘cancel’ <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/11/20/miscellanea-my-thoughts-on-assassins-creed-valhalla/"><em>AC:Valhalla</em> two weeks ago</a> (a game I continue to play, I might add).  Instead, discussing cultural products like this is a form of inoculation against their potentially negative aspects, because once a reader knows that, for instance, the depiction of a given culture in a work of fiction has relatively little to do with any real world culture, they can compartmentalize that to the fiction itself; <strong>it loses its power to mislead</strong> <strong>and so may be enjoyed in safety, as it were</strong>.  And there are good things in <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> and in the first six or so seasons of <em>Game of Thrones</em>; but we also need to be honest about the failings.</p>



<p>(Of course, more broadly, doing this as a practice exercise is a key part of building up that skill – what we may term ‘critical reading’ – more generally, rendering the alert reader more resistant to this sort of thing, both in its unintended form (as, I suspect, in this case) or  in its more dangerous<em> intended form</em>.  Put another way, developing critical reading skills is one important way to make one’s self a harder target for misinformation, including historical misinformation.)</p>



<h2>A Dash of Pure Fantasy</h2>



<p>Alright, so <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> is worth looking at closely.  So why <em>this</em> part of the fiction?  It comes down to something <a href="https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/6040/">George R.R. Martin wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>The Dothraki were actually fashioned as an amalgam of a number of steppe and plains cultures… Mongols and Huns, certainly, but also …</p></blockquote></div></div>

<p>One day, I started wondering if it would be possible to parse <a href="https://clojure.org/reference/namespaces">Clojure namespace</a> forms and generate a dependency graph of the various namespaces used in a real-world Clojure project. While that was the original motivation, I ended up down the <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/grammars">Raku grammar</a> rabbit hole, and had an enjoyable time learning how to use them. I’m glad you’re joining me in reliving that journey.</p>



<h2><a href="https://gist.github.com/samebchase/8d37f7d961ecc981e9ab9a5d36763dd5#background"></a>Background<a href="https://gist.github.com/samebchase/8d37f7d961ecc981e9ab9a5d36763dd5#grammars"></a></h2>



<h3>Grammars</h3>



<p>Informally speaking, grammars can be thought of as a set of rules that describe a language. With these rules, one can meaningfully parse (to make sense of, or deconstruct into its grammatical components) a piece of text. It turns out that this is a common task in computing. We need to frequently translate programs from one language to another. This is the job of a compiler. Before being able to translate it, the compiler needs to know whether the original program is even valid, according to the language’s grammar.</p>



<p>While we have explained in theory what grammars are, Raku grammars help us model abstract grammars as a programming construct (the <code>grammar</code> keyword and its adjacent helpers) using which we can perform parsing tasks. It is <em>important</em> to understand this distinction.</p>



<p>First class <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/grammars">grammars</a> are considered one of the revolutionary features of Raku. Normally, you’d find grammars as a library or a standalone tool, but Raku has embraced it wholesale, and has a powerful implementation of grammars which makes light work of most parsing tasks.<a href="https://gist.github.com/samebchase/8d37f7d961ecc981e9ab9a5d36763dd5#clojure"></a></p>



<h3>Clojure</h3>



<p><a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> is a modern lisp, and happens to be the language I use in <code>$DAYJOB</code>. At the top of most Clojure files, there is a namespace form importing various internal and external namespaces. This way we can neatly organize our project into many separate files, rather than having to put them all into one big file. We are shortly going to design a grammar that can parse these namespace forms.</p>



<h3><a href="https://gist.github.com/samebchase/8d37f7d961ecc981e9ab9a5d36763dd5#grammartracer"></a>Grammar::Tracer</h3>



<p><a href="https://github.com/jnthn/grammar-debugger">Grammar::Tracer</a> is helpful in figuring out where your grammar fails to match, and is invaluable in debugging. Make sure you do <code>zef install Grammar::Tracer</code> before running the code examples.</p>



<h2><a href="https://gist.github.com/samebchase/8d37f7d961ecc981e9ab9a5d36763dd5#lets-start-cookin"></a>Let’s start cookin’</h2>



<h3><a href="https://gist.github.com/samebchase/8d37f7d961ecc981e9ab9a5d36763dd5#a-trivial-example"></a>A trivial example</h3>



<p>A Clojure namespace is a Lisp form, which as expected starts with an open paren and ends with a close paren. Let’s write a grammar for one of the simplest Clojure forms, the empty list.</p>



<pre>()</pre>



<pre><code>grammar EmptyLispForm {
    token TOP { &lt;lparen&gt; &lt;rparen&gt; }

    token lparen { '(' }
    token rparen { ')' }
}</code></pre>



<p>This is one of the simplest possible grammars we can write. Parsing always starts with the <code>TOP</code> token, and recurses into the various component tokens from there. We just have two such tokens <code>lparen</code> and <code>rparen</code> which are used to denote the left and right parens. Play around with <a href="https://gist.github.com/samebchase/e988e1ed9609daffaf1849c2527af51d">trivial.raku</a> to see how we can parse this.</p>



<h3><a href="https://gist.github.com/samebchase/8d37f7d961ecc981e9ab9a5d36763dd5#warmup-slaying-a-cliched-interview-question-using-raku-grammars"></a>Warmup: Slaying a cliched interview question using Raku grammars</h3>



<p>Q: Write a program that checks that parentheses are balanced.</p>



<p>For example:</p>



<pre>() ;; balanced
(()) ;; balanced
(()(())) ;; balanced
(()(((()))) ;; unbalanced</pre>



<pre>grammar BalancedParens {
    token TOP { &lt;balanced-paren&gt; }

    token balanced-paren { &lt;lparen&gt; &lt;balanced-paren&gt;* &lt;rparen&gt; }

    token lparen { '(' }
    token rparen { ')' }

<p>It’s likely I’ve made this more wordy than necessary, but that’s still only <em>six</em> rather-readable lines.</p>



<p>Now, under time pressure which seems more likely? Coding up a stack and fiddling with corner cases or using grammars with the awesomeness of <code>Grammar::Tracer</code> to quickly hack out a declarative solution.</p>



<p>It turns out, that we have just tackled one of the trickiest aspects of writing a real-world grammar, and that is dealing with nested structures. As programmers we know that when we see nested structures, we know we will have to deal with recursion in some form.</p>



<p>You can play around with <a href="https://gist.github.com/samebchase/fad8108cb6daeaf8043d92a40eb29276">balanced-parens.raku</a> program on the console, and observe how the grammar is parsed.</p>



<p>Note: It turns out there is a <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes#Tilde_for_nesting_structures">better</a> way to parse nested structures, but this is fine for now.<a href="https://gist.github.com/samebchase/8d37f7d961ecc981e9ab9a5d36763dd5#parsing-our-first-namespace-form"></a></p>



<h3>Parsing our first namespace form</h3>



<p>Let’s try to parse this simple namespace declaration:</p>



<pre><code>;; 1   3
   |   |
;; (ns my-own.fancy.namespace)
    |                        |
;;  2                        4</code></pre>



<p>While this is easy, it is going to be an important building block in tackling more complicated namespace forms. Let’s break this down into its four component <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis#Lexeme">lexemes</a>. We can see the open and close parens, we see <code>ns</code>, the namespace <code>my-own.fancy.namespace</code> and finally the close paren. That’s it! Let’s tackle these individual pieces using a grammar.</p>



<pre>grammar SimpleNs {
    token TOP { &lt;simple-ns&gt; }

    #                  1        2            3         4
    #                  |        |            |         |
    token simple-ns { &lt;lparen&gt; &lt;ns-keyword&gt; &lt;ns-name&gt; &lt;rparen&gt; }

    token ns-keyword { 'ns' }
    token ns-name { &lt;.ns-name-component&gt;+ % '.' }
    token ns-name-component { ( &lt;.alnum&gt; | '-' )+ }

    token lparen { '(' }
    token rparen { ')' }
}</pre>



<p>Over here we can see that we have translated this into a simple Raku grammar. You could argue that defining <code>simple-ns</code> is not even required, we could have just put it in <code>TOP</code> directly, but anyway.</p>



<p>We will need to deal a little with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regexes</a> here. In the various flavours of regexes, <code>+</code> usually means one or more. <code>|</code> has a slightly different meaning from what you’re expecting, but you can check the regex <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes">documentation</a> for all the details on the difference between <code>|</code> and <code>||</code>. Loosely speaking, we are saying that a <em>namespace component</em>, i.e. the thing between two dots, is made up of one or more alphanumneric characters or hyphens. Now, if there is a rule saying a namespace has to start with an alphabetic character, and not a number, the grammar will become a little more complex, but this is a pedagogic example, so we’ll not be too pedantic.</p>



<p>I expect eagle-eyed readers to point out a few things:</p>



<ol><li>Where is <code>&lt;.alnum&gt;</code> being defined, and why does it have a dot before it?</li></ol>



<p><code>alnum</code> is predefined. The reason it has a <code>.</code> before it is so that we are not interested in capturing each letter; it’s too low level. We are interested in capturing a top-level token like <code>ns-name</code> instead, and not each individual character. Play around with the code examples by adding and removing a dot from various tokens and see the difference in <code>Grammar::Tracer</code>‘s output.</p>



<ol start="2"><li>What does <code>%</code> mean?</li></ol>



<p>This is a very useful convenience to describe patterns where something is interspersed between a bunch of other things. For example, we can have a namespace like <code>foo.bar.baz</code> or we could have an IPv4 address <code>192.168.0.1</code> where integers are separated by dots.</p>



<pre>token ns-name { &lt;.ns-name-component&gt;+ % '.' }</pre>



<p>This means that <code>ns-name</code> is made up of at least one <code>ns-name-component</code>‘s (denoted by the <code>+</code>) and separated by a <code>.</code> (denoted by <code>%</code>).</p>



<p>Okay, so this should work I guess? Let’s see what happens when we run the code!</p>



<p>No, that didn’t work. As <code>Grammar::Tracer</code> helpfully tells us, we did not account for the space after <code>ns</code>. In traditional compiler theory, there is a process of tokenisation, where some lightweight regexes are used to separate the program into its component lexemes and discard all the extraneous spaces before the parser takes over. However, here we will not do that, and we’ll deal with it in the grammar itself. Now, it could be argued whether that is a good decision, but that’s another discussion. Let’s add some allowance for whitespace and see what happens. While building the full Clojure NS grammar, I got myself into a position where I liberally used to sprinkle <code>&lt;.ws&gt;*</code> indicating zero or more whitespace characters in places where I felt that we should allow optional whitespace, as you would expect in a real-world program.</p>



<pre>token simple-ns { &lt;lparen&gt; &lt;ns-keyword&gt; &lt;.ws&gt; &lt;ns-name&gt; &lt;rparen&gt; }</pre>



<p>With that tiny addition, we are now able to parse the simple namespace form. You can play around with <a href="https://gist.github.com/samebchase/0820b9ecfdb011a9b73aedfb4ba349d1">simple-ns.raku</a>.<a href="https://gist.github.com/samebchase/8d37f7d961ecc981e9ab9a5d36763dd5#lets-make-our-lives-a-little-more-difficult"></a></p>



<h3>Let’s make our lives a little more difficult</h3>



<p>Okay, now we are getting the hang of this, so let’s see a namespace form which is a little more <a href="https://gist.github.com/samebchase/3debbe6190eb1c8f5325ae2640840db4">realistic</a>.</p>



<pre>(ns my-amazing.module.core
  (:require [another-library.json.module :as json]
            [yet-another.http.library :as http]))</pre>



<p>This is a realistic namespace form which we shall parse by adding support for the <code>:require</code> form where other libraries are imported and given a short nickname.</p>



<p>Can this be done? You bet!</p>



<pre>grammar RealisticNs {
    token TOP { &lt;realistic-ns&gt; }

    token realistic-ns { &lt;lparen&gt;
                           &lt;ns-keyword&gt; &lt;.ws&gt; &lt;ns-name&gt; &lt;.ws&gt;
                           &lt;require-form&gt;
                         &lt;rparen&gt; }

    token ns-keyword { 'ns' }

    token ns-name { &lt;.ns-name-component&gt;+ % '.' }
    token ns-name-component { ( &lt;.alnum&gt; | '-' )+ }

    token require-form { &lt;lparen&gt;
                           &lt;require-keyword&gt; &lt;ws&gt;? &lt;ns-imports&gt;
                         &lt;rparen&gt; }

    token require-keyword { ':require' }

    token ns-imports { &lt;ns-import&gt;+ % &lt;.ws&gt; }

    token ns-import { &lt;lsquare&gt;
                        &lt;ns-name&gt; &lt;.ws&gt; ':as' &lt;.ws&gt; &lt;ns-nickname&gt;
                      &lt;rsquare&gt; }

    token ns-nickname { &lt;.alnum&gt;+ }

    token lsquare { '[' }
    token rsquare { ']' }
    
    token lparen { '(' }
    token rparen { ')' }
}</pre>



<p>Nothing too scary as yet. We can see how the grammar evolves. At the top level, in <code>realistic-ns</code> we have added an extra token called <code>&lt;require-form&gt;</code> and we flesh out the details later. We can manage complexity in this manner, so that we have the ability to zoom in and out of the details as necessary.<a href="https://gist.github.com/samebchase/8d37f7d961ecc981e9ab9a5d36763dd5#using-the-parsed-data"></a></p>



<h3>Using the parsed data</h3>



<p>Now that we have been able to parse the data, we need to make use of what we’ve parsed. This is where <em>Actions</em> come into the picture.</p>



<p>When we do <code>RealisticNs.parse(...)</code>, that returns a <code>Match</code> object corresponding to the <code>RealisticNs</code> grammar. While we can query that object to get the pieces of data that we require, it is less cumbersome to use <em>Actions</em> to build up the data we are actually interested in.</p>



<p>Given, a namespace, we want to extract out:</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Thanks to a conversation I had with <a href="https://twitter.com/jackzerby">Jack Zerby</a> at Gumroad, I now feel confident asking designers to create a user interface, graphic, visual identity, or any other design artifact and have become much more productive at communicating and delegating design tasks. This is essential because my design skills are non-existent. Fortunately, design skills don’t matter in creating a spec, design thinking does. These are my notes from that&nbsp;conversation.</p>
<p>Readers familiar with speccing software or anything else may realize that the advice I’m conveying here matches both your use case and the general case. That, in fact, is the insight that I was missing before the conversation. I already knew how to spec a design, I just needed the right&nbsp;words.</p>
<h3>Step-by-Step&nbsp;Spec</h3>
<p>If you write a spec with all of this information, your designer should have everything they need to get&nbsp;started.</p>
<h4>Step 1: Specify context and&nbsp;canvas</h4>
<p>The canvas is the size and nature of the space the designer has to work in. For graphics, it is the literal dimensions, for software, it is the range of screens that a user might interface with the design from. Web vs mobile is also a canvas&nbsp;question.</p>
<p>Context is what else is nearby. This can mean other aspects of the application as a whole, or it can mean where the user is in a certain process when they encounter the design. If you are asking for a graphic to use on Twitter, that is part of the context, and is very different than asking for a graphic to use on a physical billboard in ways that just the size of the canvas doesn’t fully&nbsp;convey.</p>
<h4>Step 2: List the&nbsp;ingredients</h4>
<p>What actually goes in the design? What information needs to be conveyed? What actions does the user have access to? Be complete, if you don’t list it, the designer won’t know to include&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>An existing stylesheet, illustration, library, or other asset is also an ingredient in the&nbsp;design.</p>
<p>Make sure you have the right number of ingredients for your canvas and context. The more skilled your designer, the more range you get on this, but only to a certain&nbsp;limit.</p>
<h4>Step 3: Identify patterns and&nbsp;hierarchies</h4>
<p>Tell your designer which elements and ingredients are the most important. When you tell your designer the relative importance of the various aspects they use their tools to communicate that importance to the&nbsp;user. </p>
<p>Work with patterns of information within the hierarchy while avoiding identical sections blurring together. Information should match and rhyme, not repeat. But, without a pattern, the design will present friction to the&nbsp;user.</p>
<p>You can communicate hierarchy in words. Lists, especially nested lists, are important here. Order matters, especially in something that can be scrolled&nbsp;through.</p>
<p>If you communicate hierarchy in pictures, don’t go any higher fidelity than a <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.3-chapter-04">fat marker sketch</a>. Otherwise, you’ll artificially limit your designer early in the&nbsp;process.</p>
<h4>Step 4: Set&nbsp;tone</h4>
<p>Asking to communicate emotions, impressions, and themes is okay, even good. “X but not Y” is a powerful pattern for doing so, like “minimalist but not empty” or “whimsical but not frivolous.” The more evocative your description, the&nbsp;better.</p>
<h4>Step 5: Send and&nbsp;iterate</h4>
<p>Everything in the spec should be written to avoid friction with the designer. Every time they have to ask you what you mean or you go back and forth on an aspect of your spec, that adds friction to the design process. The faster the turnaround, the more specific your request should be. Specify how many iterations your project merits or your timeline&nbsp;allows.</p>
<p>Design iterations alternate between wide and deep. A “wide” iteration yields several versions of the requested design as a whole. A “deep” iteration takes a chosen design from the wide iteration and comes up with variations on the&nbsp;theme.</p>

        <p><a href="https://daniel-lange.com/categories/17-Strategy"><img title="Strategy: Airplanes are interesting toys but of no military value. (Marechal Ferdinand Foch, Professor of Strategy, Ecole Superieure de Guerre)" alt="Strategy" src="https://daniel-lange.com/uploads/strategy.serendipityThumb.jpg"></a></p><p>The Linux Foundation has published its <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-Linux-Foundation-Annual-Report_113020.pdf">annual report</a> today. LWN <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/838871">calls it glossy</a> and yeah, boy, it is shiny.</p>

<p>So shiny that people that work in the publishing industry immediately see this has been produced with the Adobe toolchain which - unfortunately - is one of the big suites of software not yet available for Linux.</p>

<p>Checking the PDF file metadata reveals the keywords "open source, open standards, open hardware, open data". That is what the Linux Foundation is about. Good stuff.</p>

<p><!-- s9ymdb:667 --><img width="552" height="676" src="https://daniel-lange.com/uploads/entries/Linux-Foundation-Annual-Report-2020-cover.jpg" title="Mouseovers are for xkcd!" alt="Linux Foundation annual report 2020 cover"></p>

<p>The PDF producer meta data for the annual report PDF has been set to "Linux kernel 0.12.1 for Workgroups" and the PDF creator meta data element to "Sharp Zaurus XR-5000 (Maemo5) Edition". Somebody thought to better hide the real data and had some tongue-in-cheek ideas. Kudos.</p>

<p>But nicer would have been to use Open Source software to produce the report, not?</p>

<p>Running <code>strings 2020-Linux-Foundation-Annual-Report_113020.pdf | grep Adobe | wc -l</code> gives us 1229 lines and confirms the suspicion of the toolchain.</p>

<p>A stale <code>/Title (Annual Report 2020) /Producer (macOS Version 10.15.7 \(Build 19H15\) Quartz PDFContext)</code> has been forgotten in the document to tell us about the platform.</p>

<p>So, ladies and gentlemen, the Linux Foundation 2020 annual report has been produced on a Mac.</p>

<p>Running Adobe Creative Cloud on MacOS Catalina 10.15.7.</p>

<p>Which is proprietary software. Its kernel (and some userland pieces) are based on BSD. Not Linux.</p>

<hr>

<p>The image on the front page also struck me as a bit odd ... using a ballpoint pen on the laptop screen?</p>

<p>Unbranded laptop.
Unbranded cup in the foreground.</p>

<p>Kid in the background <em>not</em> paying attention to his tablet.</p>

<p>All of that cries stock image so loud it hurts.</p>

<p>Google currently finds ~560 uses of the picture and any <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/support/article/Do-I-need-to-credit-Shutterstock-the-artist-when-I-use-Images-or-Footage">editorial use</a> nicely tells us that it is © <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/de/g/draganagordic">Dragana Gordic / Shutterstock</a>.</p>

<p>The image is "Smiling mom working at home with her child on the sofa while writing an email. Young woman working from home, while in quarantine isolation during the Covid-19 health crisis".</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8683629/Staff-working-home-nearly-extra-hour-day-research-shows-send-emails.html">Daily Mail</a> for a wonderful example of the working mum in context. I hope, if her laptop had been powered on, it would have run Linux. I mean, what else would still run on an old white MacBook with an Intel "Core 2 Duo" processor from 2008?</p>

        <p>Bonus round:</p>

<p>The Ethernet port, the USB ports and the headset connector are on the left side of the MacBook. The Daily Mail got it right.</p>

<p>Mirroring images is usually not a good idea. To Linux Foundation's defense ... similar pictures are available <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/de/image-photo/busy-young-woman-son-home-shot-1680921679">already mirrored on Shutterstuck</a> next to the <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/de/image-photo/smiling-mom-working-home-her-child-1680923362">correctly oriented picture</a>.</p>

After all, I just make a little modification and leave it behind because it's wasting time.</p>
<p>I have so much content I want to create. I don't want to stick with a piece of content for too long. When I start creating another piece of content, I try to avoid previous mistakes. I also try something new in it. The joy of creating content is you can try something new and see if it works.</p>
<p>This is the issue that makes me hesitate to create content. I want my content to be useful to my audiences. I also want to create as much content as possible. After trying some ways, I think I should prioritize the quantity rather than quality. Because I can improve my content by creating more. </p>
<p>Now, perfection for me is not the result of a piece of content. It's a process in which I try, modify, and improve pieces by pieces. If I satisfy with a blog post or video, I just publish it and create another. When I find a mistake, I will fix it.</p>

                    We propose pixelNeRF, a learning framework that predicts a continuous neural scene representation conditioned on
                    one or few input images.
                    The existing approach for
                    constructing neural radiance fields&nbsp;<a href="https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf">[Mildenhall et al. 2020]</a>
                    involves optimizing the representation to every scene independently, requiring many calibrated views and significant compute time.
                    We take a step towards resolving these shortcomings
                    by introducing an architecture that conditions a NeRF on image inputs in a fully convolutional manner. This allows the network to be trained across multiple scenes to learn a scene prior, enabling it to perform novel view synthesis in a feed-forward manner from a sparse set of views (as few as one).

                    Leveraging the volume rendering approach of NeRF, our model can be trained directly from images with no explicit 3D supervision.
                    We conduct extensive experiments on ShapeNet benchmarks for single image novel view synthesis tasks with held-out objects as well as entire unseen categories.
                    We further demonstrate the flexibility of pixelNeRF by demonstrating it on multi-object ShapeNet scenes and real scenes from the DTU dataset. In all cases, pixelNeRF outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines for novel view synthesis and single image 3D reconstruction.

                <h4>Feed-forward NeRF from One View</h4>
                <p>
                    Using multiview image supervision, we train a single pixelNeRF to 13 largest object categories
                    in ShapeNet in order to perform novel-view synthesis on unseen objects.
                    Our approach operates in <strong>view-space</strong>—as opposed to canonical—and requires <strong>no test-time optimization</strong>.
                    Nevertheless, in terms of image metrics, we significantly outperform existing methods quantitatively, as shown in the paper.

                <p>
                    Since our method requires <strong>neither canonical space nor object-level information such as masks</strong>,
                    it can represent scenes with multiple objects, where a canonical space is unavailable,
                    without modification.
                    Our method can also <strong>seemlessly integrate multiple views</strong> at test-time to obtain better results.
                    SRN performs extremely poorly here due to the lack of a consistent canonical space.

                    We show that our method can also conduct wide-baseline view synthesis on more complex real scenes from the <a href="http://roboimagedata.compute.dtu.dk/?page_id=36">DTU MVS</a> dataset,
                    producing reasonable results when given only 1-3 views at inference time.
                    Moreover, it is feed-forward without requiring test-time optimization for each scene.

		<h4>Flat — Generative infrastructure for Python</h4><p>Flat is a library for creating and manipulating digital forms of fine arts. Its aim is to enable experimentation with and testing of unpredictable or automated processes, to inspect the beginning of the "new".</p><p>It grew out of the needs for generative design, architecture and art. The concept of "design" is more of a subject of study yet to be delved into, hence the fitter term for subtitle is "infrastructure".</p><p>It is written in pure Python and distributed under a liberal license.</p><h4>Content</h4><ul><li><a href="#features">Features</a></li><li><a href="#concepts">Core concepts</a></li><li><a href="#tutorial">Tutorial</a></li><li><a href="#examples">Examples</a></li><li><a href="#reference">API reference</a></li><li><a href="#installation">Installation</a></li><li><a href="#source">Source code</a></li><li><a href="#history">Previous releases</a></li><li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li></ul><h4><a name="features"></a>Features</h4><ul><li><strong>Graphic formats</strong><ul><li>PNG, JPEG, PDF, SVG, OpenType (both TrueType and PostScript outlines), STL</li></ul></li><li><strong>Color spaces</strong><ul><li>grayscale, grayscale + alpha, RGB, RGBA, CMYK, spot colors, overprint</li></ul></li><li><strong>Image manipulation</strong><ul><li>resizing, blurring, dithering, ...</li></ul></li><li><strong>Image synthesis</strong><ul><li>Bezier path rasterization, BVH accelerated path tracing with explicit emitters and stratified sampling</li></ul></li><li><strong>Vector graphic primitives</strong><ul><li>line, polyline, ..., path, text, outlines, groups and units</li></ul></li><li><strong>Typography</strong><ul><li>kerning, greedy line breaking, threaded text frames</li></ul></li><li><strong>Computational geometry</strong><ul><li>Boolean operation on polygons</li></ul></li><li><strong>Data visualization</strong><ul><li>tree layout</li></ul></li></ul><h4><a name="concepts"></a>Core concepts</h4><p>Flat library consists of three (slightly overlapping) parts: image, document and scene.
An image is basically a container of pixels and a color kind. There are a few methods which operate over those pixels, such as "blur" or "put".
It is possible to create completely new image, by opening a file or by "rasterizing" a page of document.</p><p>Document is then assembled from pages, and each page holds number of "placed" items, both of which can be exported, too.
Here it also makes sense to introduce other entities: colors, shapes and strikes. There is support for following colors or color spaces, if you will:
the usual ones (grayscale, RGB, CMYK, ...), spot colors that can be used for controlling the application of special colorants and "overprint", which allows for printing of a graphic figure without erasing anything below it.
A shape includes both graphical properties such as stroke width or miter limit and means of creating items with said properties that are to be "placed" into a page, for example "line" or "circle".
Strike is a similar combination of text attributes (font, size, color, ...) and a way of constructing text "spans". A span likewise connects text string to text attributes, one or more spans can form a "paragraph", which in turn may form "text" or "outlines". Outlines are similar to texts but they use paths of glyph outlines, instead of characters.
One additional thing to note is that placed texts or outlines may be linked into a story or "chain" of blocks, making the text gradually "flow" from one text frame to another.
Any of the items may be placed into a "group" as well.</p><p>Finally, a scene is made of (possibly light emitting) materials, meshes built of triangular faces defined by "triplets" of 3D vertices and a camera.</p><h4><a name="tutorial"></a>Tutorial</h4><pre><code>from flat import rgb, font, shape, strike, document

red = rgb(255, 0, 0)
lato = font.open('Lato-Reg.otf')
figure = shape().stroke(red).width(2.5)
headline = strike(lato).color(red).size(20, 24)

d = document(100, 100, 'mm')
p = d.addpage()
p.place(figure.circle(50, 50, 20))
p.place(headline.text('Hello world!')).frame(10, 10, 80, 80)
p.image(kind='rgb').png('hello.png')
p.svg('hello.svg')
d.pdf('hello.pdf')
</code></pre><p>Short commentary:</p><p>We first prepared some invariants which we are going to use later, like the body typeface, some RGB color or a typeface we opened from a font file. One can think of <code>shape</code> and <code>strike</code> as of customizable factories which produce more concrete objects, for example lines or spans of text.</p><p>Next is the basic document hierarchy with just one page that can have items be placed into. The origin of coordinate system (0, 0) is at the top left corner and most of the time the default unit is "points" (1 inch = 72 points). A placed item may have some additional properties as position or <code>frame</code>. The latter is used to define the boundaries inside whose the text may run. As Flat currently lacks any kind of color management, we need to use the same color space for rasterizing the page into a PNG file.

Muhammed Abiodun / Unsplash"></a><figcaption>(Muhammed Abiodun / Unsplash)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Slack’s life as an underdog darling of Silicon Valley ended on November 2, 2016. That’s when the upstart communication startup <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13497766/slack-microsoft-teams-new-york-times-ad">published an open letter to Microsoft in the </a><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13497766/slack-microsoft-teams-new-york-times-ad">New York Times</a></em>, offering the tech giant an insincere “welcome” to the world of workplace chat software. The occasion was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/25/13405200/microsoft-teams-slack-competitor-launch">Microsoft’s launch of Teams</a>, a Slack clone that would come bundled with the company’s popular Office 365 suite of products.</p><p>In its letter, Slack warned Microsoft that “Slack is here to stay,” adding: “we’re just getting started.” But the 4 million users it had at the time would increase to just 12 million four years later, while Microsoft — which added Teams to its 365 bundle without increasing the price — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537286/microsoft-teams-115-million-daily-active-users-stats">took Teams from zero to 115 million users</a>. </p><p>That disparity helps to explain why <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/technology/salesforce-slack-deal.html">Slack sold itself this week to Salesforce</a>. The deal, which values Slack at $27.7 billion on revenues of $833 million over the past year, has largely been greeted with cheers. (Ben Thompson <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/salesforce-acquires-slack-salesforces-reasoning-salesforces-opportunity/">offers a typically excellent rundown of the opportunity here for both Salesforce and Slack</a>.)</p><p>But it also feels like the end of an era — one where workers gained new power to bring their own tools to the office, and decide for themselves how they wanted to get work done. Slack first succeeded with small teams who wanted to accelerate their work, and was often dragged into organizations by early adopters. But today, waves of consolidation are leaving people with fewer real choices.</p><p>The rise of smart phones in the early 2010s brought with it a new surge of workplace productivity tools that made mincemeat of everything that had come before them. Box and Dropbox brought easy file storage and sharing. Evernote introduced the idea of ubiquitous, cloud-synchronized note-taking. Sunrise created a more social calendar, while Mailbox and Acompli reimagined email for the mobile phone.</p><p>Slack tiptoed into the conversation in the middle of the decade, and almost immediately became the fastest-growing enterprise software tool of all time. In 2015, just 18 months after it launched, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/24/8836087/slack-1-million-daily-users">Slack reported having more than 1 million daily users</a> —&nbsp;a figure then unheard-of in enterprise software.</p><p>It had a great backstory —&nbsp;a last-ditch pivot from a failed video game called Glitch —&nbsp;and, in Stewart Butterfield, one of the tech world’s most charming founders. It also had a bold pitch: it was going to “kill email” —&nbsp;or, at the very least, reduce your reliance on it. And it would do so by integrating hundreds of other services into real-time work chat, creating a kind of all-knowing command console for your organization.</p><p>The company embodied the belief, so common in Silicon Valley, that the best product would win in the end. “Building a product that allows for significant improvements in how people communicate requires a degree of thoughtfulness and craftsmanship that is not common in the development of enterprise software,” the company wrote in its open letter to Microsoft. “How far you go in helping companies truly transform to take advantage of this shift in working is even more important than the individual software features you are duplicating.”</p><p>And yet if there’s a lesson of the past four years, it’s that thoughtfulness and craftsmanship only got the company about 10 percent as far as Microsoft did by copy-pasting Slack’s basic design. In its open letter, Slack famously told Microsoft: “You’ve got to do this with love.” In 2020, looking at Slack’s size, the idea seems laughable. What’s love got to do with it?</p><p>The thing is, I <em>hate</em> that this was the outcome for Slack. I love good productivity tools, and was rooting for Slack to someday become as good as the company hyped it up to be. (And perhaps it still will: like most giants Salesforce has a mixed track record when it comes to the success of its acquisitions, but some seem to be thriving. When I asked about this on Twitter, people had <a href="https://twitter.com/caseynewton/status/1333891286185644032?s=21">a lot of good things to say about post-acquisition Heroku</a>.)</p><p>But Slack’s struggle to succeed as an independent company sadly mirrors that of many one-time innovators in enterprise productivity. Mailbox died and Acompli sold to Microsoft, where it became the mobile Outlook app. Evernote is a pale shadow of its former self. Of that early cohort, only Box and Dropbox became — and still remain —&nbsp;public companies.</p><p>Why is this the case? To get some insight, I called up Aaron Levie, Box’s affable CEO. In Levie’s telling —&nbsp;and he also wrote <a href="https://blog.box.com/salesforce-slack-and-future-work">a blog post about the Slack sale</a> — it all comes down to sales. The idea that workers would someday choose all their own tools was always a fantasy, he told me, in part because most workers don’t event want to think about their tools. In such a world, the winning app will almost always be one with a giant, er, salesforce behind it. </p><p>Microsoft had one. Slack didn’t. Enter Salesforce.</p><p>“The reality with the enterprise is that you can have the best product, but that’s not good enough,” Levie told me. “You need distribution. And what Salesforce has — they have the procurement officers, they have the finance people. They have all of the apparatus you need to interact with to sell software, and they have it for the top 100,000 corporations around the world.”</p><p>Levie is bullish on the acquisition, because it puts Slack and Salesforce on more even ground. </p><p>“The only advantage Microsoft has is distribution, and so now they’ve neutralized the advantage that Microsoft has had,” he said. “All of a sudden, they can actually fulfill the ultimate promise of the opportunity, because they have 10 times the amount of salespeople that can go distribute this thing into corporations around the world.”</p><p>Assuming Levie is right — and I wouldn’t bet against him — that means the medium-term future of work is increasingly a choice between three giants: Microsoft, Salesforce, and (in a distant third) Google. And with that, the golden age of worker choice in productivity tools seems to be coming to an end.</p><p>That’s not to say that the incumbents won’t always face new challengers. But I wonder whether the low ceiling that Slack turned out to have has implications for some of the other fast-growing productivity companies of the current moment. Should Slack’s sale diminish our expectations for Airtable, or Notion, or Coda? Don’t get me wrong — I’m confident their investors will all get their money back, and then some. But do they have a real future outside the arms of a monolith?</p><p>If not, then the productivity market will become as consolidated as any number of other spaces on the internet, from app stores to search engines to social networks. And as our government antitrust regulators begin to awaken after a long period of hibernation, I wonder if they’ll have anything to say about it.</p><h3>The Ratio</h3><p><em>Today in news that could affect public perception of the big tech companies</em></p><p>⬆️ <strong>Trending up</strong>: <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-news-showcase-paywalled-stories/">Google</a></strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-news-showcase-paywalled-stories/">’s new paid deals with publishers mean that access to some paywalled content will now be available to readers for free</a>.

        <p>Seeing the ampersand for the first time in Elixir I wanted to dig deep into what it meant. The first <code>&amp;</code> effectively either gets a reference to the original function or starts an anonymous function. Any ampersand after the first that references the positional argument passed to it. You could use this to write very concise anonymous functions. </p><p>Here's a couple of examples:</p><pre><code>messages = ["One", "Two"]

no_capture_operator = fn msg -&gt;
  IO.inspect(msg, label: 'no_capture_operator')
  %{itemValue: msg}
end
# no_capture_operator: "One"
# no_capture_operator: "Two"

messages |&gt; Enum.map(no_capture_operator)

new_messages = messages |&gt; Enum.map(&amp;%{itemValue: &amp;1})

IO.inspect(new_messages)
# [%{itemValue: "One"}, %{itemValue: "Two"}]

new_messages = messages |&gt; Enum.map(fn msg -&gt;
  IO.inspect(msg)
  %{itemValue: msg}
end)
# "One"
# "Two"

IO.inspect(new_messages, label: "new_messages =")
# new_messages =: [%{itemValue: "One"}, %{itemValue: "Two"}]

message_func = fn msg -&gt;
  IO.inspect(msg)
  %{itemValue: msg}
end

messages |&gt; Enum.map(&amp;message_func.(&amp;1))
# "One"
# "Two"

# the enum tuples have zero-based indexes, hence the + 1
message_with_odd_even = &amp;%{itemValue: &amp;1, type: (if rem(&amp;2 + 1, 2) === 0, do: "even", else: "odd")}

msg_tuple = {"One", 0}

IO.inspect(message_with_odd_even.(elem(msg_tuple, 0), elem(msg_tuple, 1)))
# %{itemValue: "One", type: "odd"}

IO.inspect(message_with_odd_even.("One", 0))
# %{itemValue: "One", type: "odd"}

new_messages = messages |&gt; Enum.with_index |&gt; Enum.map(&amp;message_with_odd_even.(elem(&amp;1, 0), elem(&amp;1, 1)))

IO.inspect(new_messages, label: 'new_messages 2 =')
# new_messages 2 =: [%{itemValue: "One", type: "odd"}, %{itemValue: "Two", type: "even"}]

messages |&gt; Enum.each(&amp;IO.inspect(&amp;1, label: "label for " &lt;&gt; &amp;1))
# label for One: "One"
# label for Two: "Two"

          <p><em>My personal workflow for terminal-based coding, writing, research, and more!</em></p>

<p>Hello everyone!
It has been quite sometime since I last posted!
Suffice it to say, I have been immensely busy the past year but I am happy to say I am able to resurrect this blog! <img title=":tada:" alt=":tada:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f389.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p>I have thoroughly grown into my own workflow for programming, research, and writing.
Today, I am happy to be able to share it with you!</p>

<p>If you prefer to watch a video describing most of this entire process, here is an overview of my workflow from one of my <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thecedarprince">live streams</a>.
It does not go as in-depth as this document but should serve as a strong complement to this post. <img title=":smile:" alt=":smile:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f604.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/2SLZQQfMF8E"><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/workflow_youtube_vid.jpg" alt=""></a></p>



<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty">Alacritty</a> as my terminal, <a href="https://www.zsh.org/">zsh</a> and <a href="https://ohmyz.sh/">oh-my-zsh</a> as my shell and plugin manager respectively, <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux">tmux</a> as my multiplexer, <a href="https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd">lsd</a> as my list command with fun icons, <a href="https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans">Fantasque Sans Mono</a> as my typeface font, <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim">neovim</a> for my editor, <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a> paired with <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a> for speedy and interactive file finding, <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat">bat</a> an enhanced <code>cat</code> with a git diff gutter, <a href="https://github.com/jgm/pandoc">pandoc</a> for writing in markdown and LaTeX and outputting the piece to whatever file type I want, <a href="http://jacobzelko.com/setting-up-zotero/">Zotero</a> for managing my collection on scientific literature, <a href="https://github.com/ranger/ranger">ranger</a> as a terminal-based file explorer, and <a href="https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox-contrib">gruvbox-dark</a> as my general color palette.</p>

<p>Here are gists to the relevant config files I use to modify my interface and user experience:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>neovim</strong>: <a href="https://gist.github.com/TheCedarPrince/7b9b51af4c146880f17c39407815b594">init.vim</a>
</li>
  <li>
<strong>Alacritty</strong>: <a href="https://gist.github.com/TheCedarPrince/7743091bd8743a7568b718f30bf707c2">.alacritty.yml</a>
</li>
  <li>
<strong>tmux</strong>: <a href="https://gist.github.com/TheCedarPrince/07f6f8f79b1451ec436ff8dee236ccdd">.tmux.conf</a>
</li>
  <li>
<strong>zsh</strong>: <a href="https://gist.github.com/TheCedarPrince/77afe2674803d965a0f5abd108337040">.zshrc</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a picture of what that looks like altogether:</p>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/workflow_layout.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="my-workflow-in-action-boom">My Workflow in Action <img title=":boom:" alt=":boom:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4a5.png" height="20" width="20">
</h2>

<p>The following sections describe in broad strokes my workflow.
I mention some plugins that I use and are provided in my config files.
If you want to learn more about them, I encourage you to read through my config files or search for them.</p>

<h3 id="floating-terminals">Floating Terminals</h3>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/float_term.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Floating terminals are immensely powerful and I love them!
This enables me to quickly pull up a terminal and do some changes without having to split tmux panes or get out of vim.
Furthermore, what is awesome is that you can use it as a sort of <code>vim-slime</code> tool to send lines of code to the floating terminal.
This is a great feature as it uses your last used floating terminal for its target - therefore, if you switch between projects a lot, just switch your floating terminal accordingly.
No need to keep opening and closing REPL sessions and such!</p>

<h3 id="persistent-working-sessions-via-tmux">Persistent Working Sessions via tmux</h3>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/tmux_restore.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Though it is a little hard to see, I closed my terminal completely.
Oh no!
All my paneling and windows have disappeared! 
I’ll have to spend valuable time getting my workflow set back up… Or do I?</p>

<p>tmux can actually remember all these layouts with the plugins, <code>resurrect</code> and <code>continuum</code>. 
This is great for when your computer unexpectedly dies or crashes as everything is backed up at regular intervals you define!
Furthermore, pairing the (neo)vim plugin, <code>obsession</code>, allows tmux to also automatically recover vim layouts and sessions as well.
You will never have to worry about losing your terminal workflow again!</p>

<h3 id="mouse-mode">Mouse Mode</h3>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/mouse_mode.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>tmux and (neo)vim also support mouse mode and interactivity!
I can quickly jump all over the place with my mouse or easily resize any opened pane.</p>

<h3 id="interactive-file-finding">Interactive File Finding</h3>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/vim_fzf.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>I integrated the powerful file finding tool, <code>fzf</code>, with <code>ripgrep</code> to quickly find files I am looking to use. 
Then, in my (neo)vim configuration file, I merged these two together into one function that I can easily call while editing files in (neo)vim. 
find files I search for and pandoc to enable citations in pandoc, markdown, or TeX files.</p>

<h3 id="terminal-based-file-explorer">Terminal-Based File Explorer</h3>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/ranger_mode.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Furthermore, I also use the great tool, <code>ranger</code>, which allows me to have a terminal based file explorer.
It’s nice as it pops up in its own window and does not actually directly interfere with any of the background files being edited. 
It even has image preview capabilities!</p>

<h3 id="citation-engine--live-preview">Citation Engine &amp; Live Preview</h3>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/citation_mode.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>As a researcher, this part gets me immensely excited!
While I am writing, I can actively insert citation keys into whatever I am working on via <code>vim-pandoc</code>.
With my config file, you will have to specify where your own .bib file exists.
Furthermore, <code>markdown-preview</code> allows me to preview my markdown in a web browser and <code>vim-latex-live-preview</code> allows me to view my current TeX files in a pdf viewer – works for subfiles too! 
This works for whenever I write TeX files or markdown files which makes writing a breeze!</p>

<p>If any of this section is confusing, I strongly encourage you to read my article on <a href="http://jacobzelko.com/personal-research-management/">Knowledge Management</a>.</p>



<p>These are parts of my workflow that I used to use.
They have been retired for a variety of reasons but all in an effort to improve my workflow.
I have kept these around in case anyone finds it useful!</p>

<h3 id="vim-slime-for-rapid-evaluation">Vim-Slime for Rapid Evaluation</h3>

<p><strong>Rationale for deprecation:</strong> I used to use <code>vim-slime</code> but deprecated it from my workflow because of the flexibility of floating terminals.
Not only could I use floating terminals to send code, I could also quickly flip through terminals in one button press.</p>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/vim_slime.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Here, I target my Julia REPL in a tmux panel and use the <code>vim-slime</code> plugin to send code from my Julia script opened in neovim to the Julia REPL for rapid evaluation. 
This config works for any time you want to target a window.
This also works for code chunks such as functions or loops!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I hope you found my workflow and toolchain interesting!
My dream would be for this workflow to serve as inspiration for your own workflow.
Make it your own and all the best!</p>
