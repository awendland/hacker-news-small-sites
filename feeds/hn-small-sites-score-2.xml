<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The goal of this post is to review well-adopted ideas that have stood the test of time. I will present a small set of techniques that cover a lot of basic knowledge necessary to understand modern Deep Learning research. If you're new to the field, these are a great starting point.</p><div id="post-content"><p>Deep Learning is an extremely fast-moving field and the huge number of research papers and ideas can be overwhelming. Even seasoned researchers have a hard time telling company PR from real breakthroughs. The goal of this post is to review those ideas that have <strong>stood the test of time</strong>, which is perhaps the only significance test one should rely on. These ideas, or improvements of them, have been used over and over again. They're known to work.</p> <p>If you were to start in Deep Learning today, understanding and implementing each of these techniques would give you an excellent foundation for understanding recent research and working on your own projects. It's what I believe the best way to get started. Working through papers in historical order is also a useful exercise to understand where the current techniques come from and why they were invented in the first place. <strong><strong>Put another way, I will try to present a <em>minimal set</em> of ideas that most of the basic knowledge necessary to understand modern Deep Learning research.</strong></strong></p> <p>A rather unique thing about Deep Learning is that its application domains (Vision, Natural Language, Speech, RL, etc) share the majority of techniques. For example, someone who has worked in Deep Learning for Computer Vision his whole career could quickly be productive in NLP research. The specific network architectures may differ, but the concepts, approaches and code are mostly the same. I will try to present ideas from various fields, but there are a few caveats about this list:</p> <ul> <li>My goal is not to give in-depth explanations or code examples for these techniques. It's not easily possible to summarize long complex papers into a single paragraph. Instead, I will give a brief overview of each technique, its historical context, and links to papers and implementations. If you want to learn something, I <em>highly recommend</em> trying to re-produce some of these paper results from scratch in raw <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> without using existing code bases or high-level libraries.</li> <li>The list is biased towards my own knowledge and the fields I am familiar with. There are many exciting subfields that I don't have experience with. I will stick to what most people would consider the popular mainstream domains of Vision, Natural Language, Speech, and Reinforcement Learning / Games.</li> <li>I will only discuss research that has official or semi-official open source implementations that are known to work well. Some research isn't easily reproducible because it involves huge engineering challenges, for example <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">DeepMind's AlphaGo</a> or <a href="https://openai.com/projects/five/">OpenAI's Dota 2 AI</a>, so I won't highlight it here.</li> <li>Some choices are arbitrary. Often, rather similar techniques are published at around the same time. The goal of this post is not be a comprehensive review, but to to expose someone new to the field to a cross-section of ideas that cover a lot of ground. For example, there may be hundreds of GAN variations, but to understand the general concept of GANs, it really doesn't matter which one you study.</li> </ul>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks">ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (2012)</a> <span data-cites="krizhevsky_imagenet_2012">Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton (2012)</span></li> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0580">Improving neural networks by preventing co-adaptation of feature detectors (2012)</a> <span data-cites="hinton_improving_2012">Hinton et al.

It is a Deep Convolutional Neural Network based on the earlier LeNet developed by Yann LeCun. AlexNet beat previous methods at classifying images from the <a href="http://image-net.org/index">ImageNet dataset</a> by a significant margin through a combination of GPU power and algorithmic advances. It demonstrated that neural networks actually work! AlexNet was also one of the first times Dropout <span data-cites="hinton_improving_2012">Hinton et al. (2012)</span> was used, which has since become a crucial component for improving the generalization ability of all kinds of Deep Learning models.</p> <p>The architecture used by AlexNet, a sequence of Convolutional layers, ReLU nonlinearity, and max-pooling, became the accepted standard that future Computer Vision architectures would extend and built upon. These days, software libraries such as PyTorch are so powerful, and compared to more recent architectures AlexNet is so simple, that it can be implemented in only a few lines of code. Note that many implementations of AlexNet, such as those linked above, use the slight variation of the network described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5997">One weird trick for parallelizing convolutional neural networks</a> <span data-cites="krizhevsky_one_2014">Krizhevsky (2014)</span>.</p>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602">Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning (2013)</a> <span data-cites="mnih_playing_2013">Mnih et al.

What's more, the <em>same</em> neural network architecture learned to play seven different games without being told any game-specific rules, demonstrating the generality of the approach.</p> <p>Reinforcement Learning differs from Supervised Learning, such as image classification, in that an agent must learn maximize to the sum of rewards over multiple time steps, such as winning a game, instead of just predicting a label. Because the agent interacts directly with the environment and each action affects the next, the training data is not independent and identically distributed (iid), which makes the training of many Machine Learning models quite unstable. This was solved by using techniques such as experience replay <span data-cites="lin_self-improving_1992">Lin (1992)</span>.</p> <p>While there was no obvious algorithmic innovation that made this work, the research cleverly combined existing techniques, convolutional neural networks trained on GPUs and experience replay, with a few data processing tricks to achieve impressive results that most people would not have expected. This gave people confidence in extending Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques to tackle even more complex tasks such as <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">Go</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/projects/five/">Dota 2</a>, <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii">Starcraft 2</a>, and others.</p> <p>Atari Games <span data-cites="bellemare_arcade_2013">Bellemare et al. (2013)</span> have since become a standard benchmark in Reinforcement Learning research. The initial approach only solved (beat human baselines on) seven games, but over the coming years advances built on top of these ideas would start beating humans on an ever increasing number of games. One particular game, Montezuma’s Revenge, was famous for requiring long-term planning and was considered to be among the most difficult to solve. It was only recently <span data-cites="badia_agent57_2020">Badia et al. (2020)</span> <span data-cites="ecoffet_first_2020">Ecoffet et al.

While the NLP community had success with <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/">Language Modeling</a> and Translation using LSTM networks <span data-cites="hochreiter_long_1997">Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997)</span> and Encoder-Decoder architectures <span data-cites="sutskever_sequence_2014">Sutskever, Vinyals, and Le (2014)</span>, it was not until the invention of the <strong>attention</strong> mechanism <span data-cites="bahdanau_neural_2016">Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio (2016)</span> that things started to work spectacularly well.</p> <p>When processing language, each token, which could be a character, a word, or something in between, is fed into a recurrent network, such as an LSTM, which maintains a kind of memory of previously processed inputs. In other words, a sentence is very similar to a time series with each token being a time step. These recurrent models often had difficulty dealing with dependencies over long time horizons. When they process a sequence, they would easily "forget" earlier inputs because their gradients needed to propagate through many time steps. Optimizing these models with gradient descent was hard.</p> <p>The new attention mechanism helped alleviate the problem. It gave the network an option to adaptively "look back" at earlier time steps by introducing shortcut connections. These connections allowed the network to decide which inputs are important when producing a specific output. The canonical example is translation: When producing an output word, it typically maps to one or more specific input words.</p>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980">Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization</a> <span data-cites="kingma_adam_2017">Kingma and Ba (2017)</span></li> </ul> <p><strong><strong>Implementations</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://d2l.ai/chapter_optimization/adam.html">Implementing Adam in Python</a></li> <li><a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/master/_modules/torch/optim/adam.html">PyTorch Adam implementation</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/v2.2.0/tensorflow/python/keras/optimizer_v2/adam.py#L32-L281">TensorFlow Adam implementation</a></li> </ul> <figure> <img src="https://dennybritz.com/assets/deep-learning-most-important-ideas/optimizer-benchmark.png" alt=""><figcaption>Source: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11758">http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11758</a></figcaption> </figure> <p>Neural networks are trained by minimizing a loss function, such as the average classification error, using an optimizer. The optimizer is responsible for figuring out how to adjust the parameters of the network to make it learn the objective. Most optimizers are <a href="https://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/">based on variations of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)</a>. However, many of these optimizers contain tunable parameters such as a learning rate themselves. Finding the right settings for a specific problem not only reduces training time, but can also lead to better results due to finding a better local minimum of the loss function.</p> <p>Big resarch labs often ran expensive hyperparameter searches that came up with complex learning rate schedules to get the best out of simple but hyperparameter-sensitive optimizers such as SGD.

We know the knowns and our existing SRE toolchain does a very good job of validating them. In that sense, existing metrics are our tells and our tools are like Clever Hans, which happily tap away to verify what we know. What existing tools or limited metrics don’t tell us are hidden anomalies that manifest as faint glimmers in incidents when we are in fire fighting mode.</p><p>A single node failure of a standalone 3 node load balancer app has vastly different implications than a single node failure in a system where the faulty node has both upstream and downstream dependencies. Similarly, if you did not have distributed tracing, how would you map a request journey in a microservices based system? Systems evolved, problems evolved and hence tooling evolved. In the absence of tooling that evolves with problems, we are fooling ourselves to believe that our alarms cover the whole outage domain, akin to saying that Clever Hans knows math.</p><p>Making Clever Hans do math is impossible, but choosing tools that solve todayâ€™s problems and anticipate near future needs is tractable. Staying in lockstep with the problem domain of system as it evolves is key. Detecting where your existing tooling falls short and filling those gaps is a learnable skill. During that process, you will realize that marrying your existing toolchain or shoehorning problems to fit a familiar tool is counter productive.</p><p>So do you adopt every shiny new tool that shows up on hackernews? No. Exploring a tool to do a test run is one thing, ensuring enterprise adoption across teams is another. Weigh the benefits against the switching cost. Is it worth switching if the system you are solving problems for is sunsetting in the next 3 months? Conversely, isnâ€™t it worth evaluating a CI/CD tool if your team is spending most of their time doing manual deployments? These are real questions that go beyond the shimmer of superficial concerns like – <em>Is it written in my favourite programming language? Is it the next best thing I could put on my resume?</em></p><h3><span id="Takeaways"></span>Takeaways<span></span></h3><ul><li>Know your Clever Hans toolchain. Put on your poker face and ask hard subjective questions.</li><li>Bend the solutions to your problem, not new problems to old solutions.</li><li>Own your toolchain and not the other way around.</li><li>If the only tool you know is a hammer, everything will look like a nail. Identify those hammers.

<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>Galaksija was to be in Yugoslavia what Commodore and Sinclair were in the west. Whether it succeeded or not, its deceptively simple design can still teach us a lot of interesting tricks on how to make a usable computer and operating system with as few transistors and bits as possible.

<div data-url="https://kislayverma.com/organizations/independence-autonomy-and-too-many-small-teams/" data-title="Independence, autonomy, and too many small teams">
<p>“The two pizza team” paradigm has become really popular in the context of organizing software teams. The idea is to have small, self-reliant teams working independently to solve problems. The “two-pizza” refers to the guidance to keep the team small enough that we need not order more than two pizzas to feed them.</p>
<figure><img src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dev-prod-with-team-size-1024x701.jpg" data-src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dev-prod-with-team-size-1024x701.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dev-prod-with-team-size-1024x701.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dev-prod-with-team-size-300x205.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dev-prod-with-team-size-768x526.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dev-prod-with-team-size-1070x732.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dev-prod-with-team-size.jpg 1505w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dev-prod-with-team-size-1024x701.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dev-prod-with-team-size-300x205.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dev-prod-with-team-size-768x526.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dev-prod-with-team-size-1070x732.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dev-prod-with-team-size.jpg 1505w"></figure>
<p>These teams are all around us today, but we are not seeing the kind of productivity or shipping velocity that we expected to see. Most developers, especially in larger organizations, complain about meetings, the burden of communication, the slow pace of change etc. Startups often sell themselves to potential candidates by touting their agility. But why should larger companies be slow if everyone is using the same “empowered team”/”autonomous team” model for organizing themselves?</p>
<p>I argue that <strong>we have lost the original intent of the “two pizza teams”</strong> (aka autonomous teams). The way we are organizing and scaling teams as companies grow larger is exactly opposite to the spirit of the idea, and this is making the already difficult problem of keeping teams motivated and agile even more difficult.</p>
<h3><strong>Why two pizza teams</strong></h3>
<p>The concept of the “two pizza”/”autonomous” team arose from attempts to minimize communication between multiple teams and empowering a single team to be in complete control of delivering customer value.</p>
<p>Before this idea gained popularity, the most common way of organizing teams was in terms of Backend, UI, DBA, Ops etc.. Building any feature required a lot of communication, collaboration, and alignment between all these groups.</p>
<p>The notion of a small team which had all the skills required to solve a single specific problem was intended to solve this problem. A single team would be given the entirety of the problem statement and the tools it needed to solve it. This would ideally remove the problem of aligning multiple teams around shared roadmaps and delivery schedules and allow the team to own the problem solving process end-to-end.</p>
<p>There are two core concepts underlying the two-pizza team – <strong>mission</strong> and<strong> independence</strong>. Ideally, end-to-end means all the way to the customer or the business. Hence, <strong>every autonomous team is expected to generate direct business value all by itself</strong>, without a lot of overlap with other teams. Additionally, <strong>the team should be able to meets its goals independently</strong> (i.e. without reliance on or interference from other teams) This reduces the cross team communication overhead because its members have all the skills needed to solve the problem.</p>
<h3>What went wrong</h3>
<p>Somewhere along the line, we forgot about “reducing communication” just started fixating on assigning independent teams to problem statements that were essentially tiny slices of business problems. As the problem space gets more finely sliced in hopes of achieving scale at each step, so does the number of teams. e.g. What might have been a “Data Delivery Team” charged with delivering fresh data to customers unfortunately becomes “Data ingestion Team”, “Data processing Team” and “Data Release Team” (real world example).</p>
<p>This causes problems with both the core tenets of the autonomous team philosophy.</p>
<figure><img src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-1024x809.jpg" data-src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-1024x809.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-1024x809.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-300x237.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-768x607.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-1070x845.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions.jpg 1484w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-1024x809.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-300x237.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-768x607.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-1070x845.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions.jpg 1484w"></figure>
<p>The <strong>mission is diluted because most of the teams are now working on problems which are subsets of the original problem and as such not valuable in themselves</strong>. The success of a team can no longer guarantee the improvement of at least one business metric. The team’s work is not tied to a business objective any longer, so it gets tied to tightly defined execution scopes.”Data ingestion team” is supposed to pull in data, that’s it. While the team is still allowed to do this however it wants, succeeding in its objective will not mean that fresh data is being delivered to the customer. </p>
<p>Autonomy is diluted as a direct fallout. <strong>Where a single team could have come together to solve problems of data delivery, now multiple teams with different managers and different roadmaps must come together to deliver anything to the customer</strong>. This creates exactly the kind of coordination overhead that these small teams were created to solve in the first place.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Coordination, also known as alignment, communication, shared roadmap, Gantt chart and many other positive sounding names, is the arch-enemy of the autonomous team</strong>. </p>
<p>We have lots of small teams with lots of independence and no direct impact that keeping everyone pointed in one direction has become a nightmare. Program Managers paper over the ever-increasing complexity involved in coordinating priorities, efforts, and timelines, with developers and managers increasingly wash their hands of the whole business of communicating with other teams.</p>
<p>We took a good idea too far. The current “small” team is certainly small, but we forgot the part about reducing communication. Instead we are now offered “small, highly collaborative” teams as some sort of new ideal, as if high collaboration is something to be desired during execution.</p>
<p>This is a huge blind spot for organizations. The implicit goodness of small teams (devoid of any of the original context) is now internalized to such an extent that deep collaboration between small teams is considered a good thing in the organization. Team productivity and motivation keeps falling even as their sizes increase. And somehow we still believe this way of organizing work among teams is efficient, and something else must be causing the diminishing productivity.</p>
<hr>

<hr>
<h3>Collaboration is not good</h3>
<p>Collaboration is a great idea during ideation and brainstorming. It helps in getting a lot of input from lots of different people and can help us discover new aspects which we may not consider ourselves. It can expose other approaches to solving the problem, or even some versions of this problem that have already been solved by others. <strong>Broad stroked collaboration between people and systems is how we build something that is greater than the sum of its parts.</strong></p>
<p>However, <strong>once we reach the execution phase, collaboration is extremely costly.</strong> Collaboration means that two people or teams cannot just focus on doing their jobs, they also have to worry about when the other person is going to finish theirs and how they are going to synchronize with each other to hit the finish line.</p>

<p>I can quote any number of engineering principles to refute the deification of collaborative teams which seems to be the norm today.</p>
<p>In general, it is assumed that multithreading improves the performance of a system. This is completely true if each thread can execute completely independently on its own core without talking to any other thread or sharing any data. However, the moment we end with some shared state or more threads than CPUs, the synchronization overhead can quickly outstrip all the performance gains from using the technique.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Amdahl’s law</a> puts a finite upper limit on the increased output when an extra worker is added into the mix. The well-known problem is that every extra worker imposes non-parallelizable, exponentially increasing communication overhead. At some point, adding another worker makes things worse rather than better.</p>
<p>“<em>9 developers cannot finish a 9 month project in one month</em>” is a well-known idea in software management. And yet we see managers trying to grow and manage their teams in isolation. Why is that?</p>
<p>My hypothesis is that we see individual teams delivering quickly and we interpret this to mean that adding more members to these teams will further scale the output. In a world where we examine teams by isolating them from the overall system context, it is very easy to confuse independent with autonomous.</p>
<h3>Independence is not Autonomy</h3>
<p>In a highly collaborative setup, the correct way of looking at the organization is like a factory floor. <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints#:~:text=The%20theory%20of%20constraints%20(TOC)%20is%20an%20overall%20management%20philosophy,Critical%20Chain%2C%20published%20in%201997." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Theory of constraints</a></strong> tells us that the only way to increase output in this situation is to broaden the bottlenecks and widen the entire “flow of work” from conception to final delivery to the customer.</p>
<figure><img src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1024x349.jpg" data-src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1024x349.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1024x349.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-300x102.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-768x262.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1536x523.jpg 1536w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1070x365.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams.jpg 1916w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1024x349.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-300x102.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-768x262.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1536x523.jpg 1536w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1070x365.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams.jpg 1916w"></figure>
<p>But when we look at each step individually and out of context of the rest of the “pipeline”, “delivery” takes on a very different meaning. It just means “out of my door”. Any attempts to improve output with such a perspective will only create local maxima which means nothing for the final output – it might even be detrimental.</p>
<p>This is where we end up with too many small teams which are only looking at their little slice of work. That is what they are incentivised to do. If the outputs of our teams are arranged sequentially, they are not autonomous in delivery, no matter how independent they might be in their day to day work.</p>
<p>Anyone who has managed a supply chain can tell, independent teams organized in a sequential manner MANDATE a lot of communication and feedback. The lines of communication have not been removed by the creating small teams – they have been multiplied manifold. What’s worse, communication is happening at team boundaries where it is actually the weakest (the <a href="https://kislayverma.com/programming/overcoming-io-overhead-in-micro-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">communication overhead in microservices</a> springs to mind readily).</p>

<p>Without an autonomous mission, independent teams are forever shackled by the communication overhead.</p>
<h3><strong>Autonom</strong><strong>y</strong><strong> is a customer facing construct</strong></h3>
<p>What happens if we organize our independent teams by problem statement rather than function? A team that is authorized to solve a customer problem using any means at its disposal in essence owns the entire “pipeline” of tasks that need to be done. There is no cross-team collaboration and communication required for this team to do its job. This team not only operates independently, it also delivers value to the customer independently.</p>
<p><strong>A team is autonomous when it “delivers value to the customer” independently</strong>. In his novel “<a href="https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/8185984565?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=kislayverma-21&amp;camp=3638&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=8185984565" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Goal</a>“, Eliyahu M. Goldratt highlights this beautifully by having his protagonist (who is plant manager) define his success to mean increased sales. Sales is usually not the problem of the manufacturing team, but the novel highlights how defining a customer facing “global” goal transforms the poorly performing plant.</p>

<br><img src="http://www.niquette.com/books/images/IllumLet/i.gif" nosave="" height="33" width="11"><span size="+1">n
October, 1953, I coined the word 'software.'</span>
<p><span size="+1">The notion of software as a separate thing from hardware
took years to assert itself. Sure, the computer (popularly referred to
as a "giant brain" in the early fifties) was unable to do anything but
consume electrical power until a "programmer" came along to "program" it,
and the consequent "routines" resided in the computer's "memory" thereafter.
One did not, in the beginning, take a program written for one computer
and put it into another.&nbsp; A half-century later, most people will find
that hard to imagine.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">As originally conceived, the word 'software' was merely
an obvious way to distinguish a program from the computer itself. A program
comprised sequences of written -- changeable -- instructions each endowed
with the power to command the behavior of the permanently crafted machinery
-- the "hardware."</span>
</p><p><a name="retdict"></a><span size="+1">For the origin of the word 'software,'
most <a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/softword/AppA.htm#typdict">dictionaries</a> give an unknown source
and 1960 as the date, but [expletive deleted] I was there! That's the only
exclamation point I intend to use in this introduction.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">Fifty years ago, I was writing programs for the SWAC at
UCLA, one of only 16 digital computers in the whole U.S. When I was first
struck by the word 'software' (it was an epiphany), I shook my head and
chuckled.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">When I first said 'software' out loud, people around me
said, "Huh?" From the very beginning I found the word too informal to write
and often embarrassing to say. Nevertheless, with smirking trepidation
I did occasionally feature the word 'software' in speeches and lectures
and media interviews throughout the fifties.</span>
</p><p><a name="retneol"></a><span size="+1">It was just a throw-away thing.
The word 'software' was hardly my most notable invention, even back then.
Nothing to write home about (I was only 19 years old and still living at
home).&nbsp; The word 'software' did not belong in a technical paper (besides,
an undergraduate is but a ghostwriter for principal researchers).&nbsp;
Then too, I had a reputation at UCLA as a practical joker. Colleagues and
friends simply shrugged, no doubt regarding each utterance as a tiresome
prank or worse, another offbeat neologism, for which I was also becoming
<a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/softword/AppD.htm#sniglets">noted</a>.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">Nobody in 1953 would have guessed that the silly word
would take hold, that within a few decades 'software' would enter the general
vocabulary for products and for professions -- that a worldwide industry
would wear it as a solemn name. You can be sure that if my ego and I had
harbored any such glorious visions, then... then, what?</span>
</p><p><a name="re38k"></a><img src="http://www.niquette.com/books/images/IllumLet/a.gif" nosave="" height="33" width="33"><span color="#000000"><span size="+1">t
the time of this writing, there are about 4.2 million issued patents (I
once met Bob Hudson, inventor of an asphalt recycling machine for which
he was awarded U.S. Patent No. 4,000,000 -- but I digress). There must
be at least that many more worldwide -- a total, say, of 10 million. Every
patent has some number of "claims" (my largest -- ahem -- for the first
digital cassette recorder has 106 claims). Each patent-claim is, in effect,
a separate invention, an average of perhaps ten per patent. So there must
be at least a hundred million officially recognized inventions in the world.
Punch Line: There are only <a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/softword/AppD.htm#38k">38,000 words</a> in the
English Language.</span></span>
</p><p><span size="+1"><i>Nota bene</i>, the hundred million issued patent-claims
officially recognize only a small fraction of the world's inventions, but
the rest are inventions just the same. An inventor does <i>not</i> apply
for patent protection for each and every idea before reducing it to practice.&nbsp;
Likewise, a person inventing a word does <i>not </i>submit it for publication
in a dictionary before speaking it or writing it.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">By comparison to other inventions, words are rare indeed.
One reason is that there is no commercial value to them, which is why patents
do not apply to words: You want to say "<a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/101words/holomrph.htm">holomorph</a>"?
-- get out your checkbook. Copyrights don't make sense either, since a
word uncopied has no linguistic value at all. Trademarks, truth be known,
protect the interests of buyers not sellers; accordingly, a "wordmark"
would benefit listeners and readers not speakers and writers. Words are
<i>coined</i>
and thus spent -- circulated, borrowed, defaced, worn out, and lost.</span>
</p><p><img src="http://www.niquette.com/books/images/IllumLet/d.gif" nosave="" height="33" width="30"><span size="+1">ictionaries
are not gate keepers like the Patent Office but merely infrequent periodicals,
passively reporting on linguistic usage, relying necessarily on snippets
in published documents -- in non-dictionaries. Once usage for an invented
word becomes established, however, the etymological trail gets cold quickly,
and if the original utterance is undocumented, even a linguistic bloodhound
may not pick up the scent of the true inventor. Pity the verbal coiner,
unrewarded, unacclaimed, unattested.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1"><span color="#000000">Inventors themselves, it seems plain,
do a whole lot better job of inventing <i>things</i> than inventing words
to call things. The bicycle got its 'pedal' from the piano, the engine
appropriated 'piston' from the trombone, the airplane named its 'fuselage'
from the sewing spindle and its 'empennage' from the tail feathers of an
arrow.&nbsp; </span>Millions of inventions apply to computers, both hardware
and software. Readers are invited to check <a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/sophmag/compsci.htm">What's
Not in a Name?</a> and <a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/sophmag/mukashi.htm">Mukashi </a>for
lamentations about the dearth of inventive language in 'The Software Age'.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">'The Software Age' -- now, there's an ambitious coinage.
The previous sentence deserves an exclamation point and so does the next
one. Without software, there would be neither "The Computer Age" nor "The
Information Age."&nbsp; Same for "The Space Age."&nbsp; Meanwhile, is "The
Atomic Age" officially over? How much longer will "The Petroleum Age" last?
Accordingly, does 'The Software Age<b>'</b> have any real competition?</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">All right, so one can get a patent on an invention, a
copyright on a book, a trademark on a name, but what does one get to assert
primacy as the originator of a word? As noted above, t<span color="#000000">here
is no proprietary instrument that protects a word. Nor, of course, would
one want one ("I'll sue you if you use that term, I have the 'wordright'
on it"). On the contrary, t</span>he idea is to put each coinage into currency,
not horde it away.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">And then the grandkids grow up and there comes a time
to write one's memoirs.&nbsp; This one is dedicated to my first great-grandchild,
<a href="http://www.niquette.com/selections/charlotte/charlotte1.htm">Charlotte</a>.</span></p></div></div></div>]]>

And an added unexpected bonus has been that Google Meet (or whatever its called this week) has worked surprisingly well for our internal meetings and standups etc. And at $6 per user pm, it fit our budget.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-fdt4q"><p><a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Slack</strong></u></span></a><span>.

We added Carta for managing equity, Datadog and Sentry for deployment metrics, LaunchDarkly for feature flags, SalesForce and Outreach for CRM and email campaigns, Figma for design iteration, etc., but even still our total spend across all tools is less than $500 a month. It’s a great age to build a company with the wealth of inexpensive, amazing tools on the market.</span></p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

						<article id="post-4178">

                             
							<section itemprop="articleBody">

								<p><span>I cannot think of a better interlocutor than <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/">Chris Dilow</a>. He raises another set of interesting questions in his <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2020/07/ideas-interests-and-capital.html">reply</a> to my <a href="https://www.philosophyofmoney.net/angrynomics-a-reply-to-chris-dillow/">reply</a>. I am in danger of completely forgetting our original divergence of thought, but that bothers me not at all.</span></p>
<p><span>I have read a lot of Marx, and always want to read more. Marx is rightly regarded as the greatest social theorist. Marx was legendary synthesiser of thought. In this regard, <a href="https://www.philosophyofmoney.net/values-in-economics/">Habermas</a> – the <a href="https://www.philosophyofmoney.net/the-most-important-social-scientist-since-keynes/">greatest moral philosopher since Kant</a> – is his true heir. </span></p>
<p><span>Marx also created a framework of making sense of social change, organisation and power which is unrivalled in its completeness and coherence. In addition to his profound perceptiveness, this very coherence and completeness appeals in its own right. But I feel a different form of intellectual affinity with Marx. The coherence he attributes to social evolution is also the weakness in his framework. Marx, if you take his writing as a whole, knew this instinctively. There is a coherent theory of social evolution to be found in his writings, but there is also repeated arbitrary divergence from this theory and creative, chaotic asides that make his writing so absorbing. We can thank Marx for providing a theory of social change, a theoretical ‘ideal type’. It is a model that it almost always pertinent, but – perhaps always – incomplete, and often completely misleading.</span></p>
<p><span>A perspective I have long held about markets I partly attribute to Marx. It is actually an argument for the moral force of markets (not capitalism, per se, but certainly markets) – that free exchange is the antithesis of tribalism. The great French anthropologist, Marcel Mauss, put it most succinctly: “In order to trade, we must first lay down our spear”. Marx, too, saw very clearly how global capitalism could be the enemy of tribal nationalism.</span></p>
<p><span>Perhaps intriguingly, I also want to bring Hayek in here. Hayek, Marx and Mauss view markets in ways which are far more instructive than that present in microeconomic textbooks. And here simplistic economic ideology has hindered understanding. So, one evolutionary function of markets is as a positive-sum method of conflict resolution. Everyone should be aware of this. If we perceive there to be a finite resource – say oil – let us use prices to determine who gets what, and incentivise the invention of substitutes. It’s better than the alternative. </span></p>
<p><span>Hayek diverges from the standard micro-theory of markets by assuming imperfect information – quite rightly – and focussing on the role markets play in processing information. This too is profoundly insightful. In Hayek’s view, capital seeks informational advantages – this is a motivating force. If we already knew everything, we would do nothing. The pursuit of ‘excess return’ is the very lifeblood of innovative and dynamic capital. </span></p>
<p><span>Hayek’s observations on the distribution of information are equally important. His critique of central planning significantly resides in the insight that the most important information is local to the individual and unobservable – it is in our heads. Only the individual knows what they want at any point in time.</span></p>
<p><span>As an aside, it is worth noting that Keynes, unsurprisingly, was the most astute psychologist in this cannon of thinkers on the motives of capital. He was totally open to the likelihood that many of the greatest investors – i.e. those that had the longest time-horizons and made the greatest contributions to human well-being – were motivated by nothing more than fascination at what could be achieved.</span></p>
<p><span>How does any of this bear on my discussion with Chris? My sense is that the motives and forms of capital at work in our societies are more diverse than at any point since the industrial revolution.  As Mark and I argue in <em><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Angrynomics-Eric-Lonergan/dp/1788212797/ref=sxts_sxwds-bia-wc-p13n1_0?adgrpid=100757164789&amp;cv_ct_cx=angrynomics&amp;dchild=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw0_T4BRBlEiwAwoEiAWWpdQP-57O0aMprUkKmpjQbVHNLZX8R0CBQQI7Zar3_prk6eVgopBoCIKEQAvD_BwE&amp;hvadid=435785345402&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=9045955&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=17321262343375037874&amp;hvtargid=kwd-884601278301&amp;hydadcr=24397_1816021&amp;keywords=angrynomics&amp;pd_rd_i=1788212797&amp;pd_rd_r=9a0d48ba-8492-4b48-b95c-ff635870897b&amp;pd_rd_w=RS60x&amp;pd_rd_wg=H99aG&amp;pf_rd_p=9b1a9511-9af9-4d06-8643-d54ebec511ef&amp;pf_rd_r=AP1416WT4M1BSGAJVPF5&amp;psc=1&amp;qid=1595773559&amp;sr=1-1-fdbae751-0fa5-4c0f-900b-865654896618&amp;tag=googhydr-21">Angrynomics</a></em>, deregulation has set capital against capital, and asset price delusions add spice to this chaos. Myopic speculators finance blue-sky infinite-horizon destroyers of capital, such as Elon Musk – the world’s embodiment of a Keynesian investor.  Somewhat hilariously, a new form of elite social status – start-upism – is fantastically anti-capital, and its effects are super-charged by the secular collapse in the cost of semi-conductors. Despite its importance, none of this was predictable.</span></p>
<p><span>I struggle to see capital as the obstacle to progress in this world. If anything, a chaotic series of capitalist motivations – a collapse in the cost of debt to the state and a plethora of extraordinary technological innovations – have provided us with the very <a href="https://www.philosophyofmoney.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/PM-Europe-roundtable.pdf">means to tackle our greatest challenges</a>. The failure of innovation is in public policy and democratic process.</span></p>
<p><span>This leads me in conclusion to more a ominous question. Hayek explained why China could not succeed. Central planning doesn’t work because the most important information is in our heads – only we know what we want to do. Really? Why has China progressed more rapidly and pervasively than any other major economy in AI, machine learning, fintech and social media. Because the contents of our minds is now available to the social planner. Is Marx about to have the last laugh?</span></p>

      <span>3 minutes to read</span>
    </p>
  </div><div>
    <p>Large projects and mono repos can be a pain to navigate. <strong>gg</strong>
is a small script I use almost everyday to make it easier.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever worked with WordPress —&nbsp;or really most CMSes for
that matter — the base application configuration, themes,
plugins, etc. are typically given their own sub directories to
help isolate them. For WordPress development, I use the
<a href="https://roots.io/">Roots</a> stack and it does a great job of
making the project structure relavant, however, since it is
still WordPress, the project structure is not exactly flat.
Often I’ll need to jump to Trellis’ directory to start the
development VM, run a deploy, or update an environment’s
configuration, but shortly after jump back to the directory of
the theme or plugin I’m working on. Remembering the level of
depth and simply writing out the path can be a tedious and
erroneous task.</p>
<h2 id="a-simple-solution">A simple solution</h2>
<p><strong>gg</strong> is a very simple Bash script I wrote to make is 100%
easier to jump between directories in a large project. Here’s a
short clip of it in action with a Roots project:</p>

<p>
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w0SjUNTfzKk" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="">
    </iframe>
</p>
<h2 id="breaking-down-the-script">Breaking down the script</h2>
<p>There are a few requirements you will need before you get started:</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong>: <code>git</code>, <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf"><code>fzf</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd"><code>fd</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher"><code>ag</code></a></p>
<p>You most likely should be able to achieve the same thing with
built-in tools or alternatives to <code>fd</code> and <code>ag</code> (maybe even
<code>fzf</code>), but for this tutorial, I’ll use the tools listed above.
One note before diving into the script, I do have the following
set for my FZF default command:</p>
<pre><span>export </span><span>FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND</span><span>='</span><span>ag -g ""</span><span>'
</span></pre>
<p>The script itself is pretty simple. There are two parts to it.
First, if we want to see all of the directories within our
project, even if we are already in a nested directory, we will
need to jump to the root of the Git repo. Luckily, it is
relatively easy to do this with Git. Using Git’s <code>rev-parse</code>
subcommand with the <code>--show-toplevel</code> flag, we can get “the
absolute path of the top-level-directory.” Since this is useful
in itself, but still a tad cumbersome to remember and write out,
we’ll create a function for it:</p>
<pre><span>gr</span><span>() {
</span><span>  </span><span>cd </span><span>`</span><span>git</span><span> rev-parse</span><span> --show-toplevel</span><span>`
</span><span>}
</span></pre>
<p>If you already have a set of Git-aliases, you might find naming
conflicts with the ones I will create in this tutorial and in
that case, or in the case you don’t like the names I’ve picked,
you will need to use a different name.</p>
<p>The next step is to create an easy way to find a sub-directory.
If you’ve ever used a fuzzy-search tool, you’ll know that that
they are pretty great. Knowing the fuzzy-search capabilities of
<code>fzf</code>, I know I can do something like <code>cd $(fzf)</code> to almost
achieve what we’re looking for, however, that finds directories
and files, the latter of which we do not need. Luckily, we can
use a finder tool with <code>fzf</code> to get what we need. I’ll use <code>fd</code>
to achieve this:</p>
<pre><span>gd</span><span>() {
</span><span>  </span><span>cd </span><span>`
</span><span>    </span><span>fd --type</span><span> d</span><span> --hidden --follow --exclude</span><span> .git \
</span><span>    </span><span>| </span><span>fzf --preview </span><span>"</span><span>ls -Ap {}</span><span>"
</span><span>  </span><span>`
</span><span>}
</span></pre>
<p>We are telling <code>fd</code> to just find directories, follow symbolic
links, allow hidden directories, but exclude the <code>.git</code>
directory. Luckily, <code>fd</code> already respects <code>.gitignore</code> so we do
not need to worry about dependencies or build files polluting
our search selection. Also, we are making it fancy with a
preview window of the selected directory’s contents.</p>
<p>I prefer to leave these as separate functions in case I want to
just jump to the Git repo root or jump to a sub-directoy within
the current directory. For the final <code>gg</code> command, we can just
use an alias:</p>
<pre><span>alias </span><span>gg</span><span>="</span><span>gr &amp;&amp; gd</span><span>"
</span></pre>
<p>And that’s it. Here’s the full and final script:</p>
<pre><span>#!/usr/bin/env bash
</span><span>
</span><span># Go to Git root
</span><span>gr</span><span>() {
</span><span>  </span><span>cd </span><span>`</span><span>git</span><span> rev-parse</span><span> --show-toplevel</span><span>`
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span># Go to sub-directory
</span><span>gd</span><span>() {
</span><span>  </span><span>cd </span><span>`
</span><span>    </span><span>fd --type</span><span> d</span><span> --hidden --follow --exclude</span><span> .git \
</span><span>    </span><span>| </span><span>fzf --preview </span><span>"</span><span>ls -Ap {}</span><span>"
</span><span>  </span><span>`
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span># Go to a directory within the current Git repository
</span><span>alias </span><span>gg</span><span>="</span><span>gr &amp;&amp; gd</span><span>"
</span></pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>Join the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23981563">HN discussion</a>!</p></blockquote><p>The existing open-source funding models don't work well for small projects.</p><p>Big projects —&nbsp;operating systems, frameworks, CMSs, or fully self-hostable applications — are in a privileged position to extract more value from their users, especially corporate ones. Since entire APIs and products are built on top of them, they inspire enough appreciation (or, more likely, fear of obsolescence!) to net a sustainable income from one-off or monthly donations.¹</p><p>But most OSS projects aren't big. The typical project on GitHub is better described as a <strong>utility</strong> — an apt term, given the <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/research-reports/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/">infrastructural role</a> these projects play in the world. It is a small tool that does one thing really well. Over the course of building a complex application, you may end up using dozens of these utilities — and they'll save you hundreds of hours of development time. </p><p>Unfortunately, utilities like these rarely bring in any meaningful amount of money from donations, no matter how widely used or beloved they are. Consider <a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router">react-router</a>. Even with 41.3k stars on GitHub, 3M weekly downloads from NPM, and nearly universal adoption in React-based single-page applications, it only brings in <a href="https://opencollective.com/react-router">~$17k</a> of donations annually. </p><p>The root of the problem is that open-source donations are made on a per-project basis². To support a project via GitHub Sponsors or OpenCollective, you must create yet another auto-renewing monthly subscription for each project you want to support. Moreover, at the moment of truth (<em>"I'm gonna sponsor X!"</em>) it's easy to "logic" yourself out of donating (<em>"But what if it gets replaced by some new hotness next week?!"</em>). This has a huge dampening effect on total donations to open source. And in the end, only the projects that are massively, insanely, indisputably useful get funded. And those projects are usually the "big stuff" — frameworks, self-hostable software, etc.</p><p>A new model is needed; one that works for the small- and medium-sized projects, not just the huge ones. So I propose a novel(-ish) approach to OSS sustainability. </p><h2>Introducing "sponsor pools"</h2><ol><li>Every month, you donate some amount into a "wallet".</li><li>Your funds are then distributed to the projects in your "sponsor pool". Your sponsor pool is just the set of open-source projects you want to support.</li><li>Adding new projects to your pool should require <strong>one click</strong> —&nbsp;as easy as starring the repo on GitHub.</li></ol><p>That's it. It's hardly ingenious, which is why it's surprising that no major player in OSS has implemented it for facilitating open source donations.³</p><p>This would achieve the holy grail of OSS sustainability: the one-click sponsorship.⁴ Once a person has funded their sponsor pool, it would take <em>a single click</em> to financially support another project. <mark>The marginal cost — both psychological and financial — of supporting additional projects would drop to zero.</mark> That's a game changer.</p><h3>Why this works better</h3><p>Why do I think this will dramatically increase the total amount donated to open source? To answer that, consider a hypothetical question.</p><p><em>How much of your income would you be willing to donate to open-source software every year?</em></p><p>I suspect the typical overpaid HN lurker reading this post (👋) came up with a number in the hundreds of dollars. Compare that with how much you’re actually donating — is there a difference? There is for me. <mark>That's because there's currently no way to make a donation to the abstract concept of "open source software".</mark> But with sponsor pools, donation amounts will reflect an honest answer to the question posed above.</p><h3>GitHub</h3><p>The best case scenario, in my opinion, is for GitHub to natively support this model as an extension of GitHub Sponsors. It's where most projects live so it's best positioned to create a zero-friction donation system like this.</p><p>Of course, if GitHub implemented something like this, they would likely divorce the donation mechanism from stars. Perhaps instead, users who have created and funded a sponsor pool can be presented with an "Add to Pool" button in place of the current "Sponsor" button.</p><p><img alt="Add to pool button" src="https://vriad.com/add_to_pool.png"></p><p>GitHub has a financial incentive to switch to this approach — sort of. They're currently eating the cost of all processing fees for transactions on GitHub Sponsors. So if you sponsor a project at $1/mo, the maintainer gets $1/mo...and GitHub pays $0.30 to the credit card companies. Larger donation sizes means GitHub pays a proportionally smaller amount as fees.</p><p>Note that I said <em>proportionally smaller</em>. If more total donations are being processed (which is the goal of this proposal!), they may still end up paying more in total fees, even if the ratio of fees-to-donations is smaller. If the sponsor pool concept is massively successful —&nbsp;say, cumulative donations of $1B annually — GitHub will be eating nearly $20M in card fees. I suspect that would ruffle some feathers at Microsoft.</p><p>As a final addendum —&nbsp;I'd love to see embeddable "badges" that are unlocked at different levels of donorship.&nbsp;Imagine a world where you see a "GitHub Sponsor Gold Badge" in the footer of someone’s website, indicating that they donate, say, $1000+ annually to open source. Clicking on this badge would bring you to a trusted site that lets you verify the claim. Here's my quick-and-dirty attempt at a badge design:</p><p><img alt="order of the gold octocat" src="https://vriad.com/gold_octocat.jpg"></p><p>Some may cry "virtue signaling" but approaches like this are a proven way to establish positive reinforcement loops that a) increase awareness and b) encourage more folks to donate to open source.</p><h2>Wrapping up</h2><p>This is a hard problem with a vast array of potential solutions. I don't mean to criticize any existing approaches; they've all done a lot for maintainers, including myself, and I don't mean to minimize that. There may also be major implementational or regulatory hurdles to building something like this that I'm not aware of. This is merely a hypothetical exercise.</p><p><em>My name is Colin and write proposals like this one every month or so. Put your email in the box to get future proposals delivered to your inbox. ✌️</em></p></div><div><p><em>Alternatively follow me <a href="https://twitter.com/vriad">on Twitter</a> or subscribe to <a href="https://vriad.com/rss.xml">the RSS feed</a>.</em></p><h3>Footnotes</h3><blockquote><p>¹ Some examples of financially successful large projects.</p><ul><li>operating systems: Red Hat, Elementary OS</li><li>frameworks: Livewire, Next.js </li><li>CMSs: Ghost, Wordpress</li><li>Full-featured applications: Sentry, Blender, Discourse</li></ul></blockquote><br><blockquote><p>² It's worth noting that currently GitHub Sponsorships actually correspond to a given user or organization, NOT a particular repository or project. </p><p>I think it's important that the sponsorship pools themselves are comprised of projects, <em>not</em> users or organizations. This gets complicated if multiple entities/organizations are listed as the maintainers of a particular project. There would need to be a mechanism in place to split the incoming donation money among the set of maintainers as they see fit.</p></blockquote><br><blockquote><p>³ It's been pointed out to me that <a href="https://flattr.com/">Flattr</a> uses this exact model! Unfortunately they're not intended for open source software specifically and simply don't have enough awareness to really move the needle. For this model to reach it's potential, it needs to be implemented by a visible, trusted, established player.</p><p>Other organizations trying interesting things: <a href="https://snowdrift.coop/">Snowdrift</a> ("crowdmatching"...very cool concept), <a href="https://flossbank.com/">Flossbank</a> (a Tidelift-like model), <a href="https://gitcoin.co/">Gitcoin</a>.</p></blockquote><br><blockquote><p>⁴ The even holier grail: a zero click sponsorship! An example of this approach is <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave Browser's</a> token-based micropayments system. Brave lets you fund your "wallet" with various cryptocurrencies, which are then distributed to creators proportional to the time you spend on their site.</p><p>It’s a great idea, but surveillance is necessary to gather the requisite information. This is implemented ethically by Brave, but that’s only possible because they control the full browser experience. For this to work across browsers would require an extension with full access to your browsing patterns. So probably a non-starter.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]>

<p>Early on at Compression.ai, our main image compression algorithm used to look a lot more like most other Machine Learning (ML) based image compression algorithms — an auto-encoder. We had a branched neural network as the encoder, a branched neural network as the decoder, and an entropy coding module sandwiched in the middle. We then trained this whole network using the 1M ImageNet dataset, which contain just over 1 million images.</p>
<p>It was super simple. And it worked! Our model compressed images at 0.8 bit-per-pixel (bpp), while keeping the MS-SSIM over 0.99. Comparing against all the published work at the time, we were at the top in terms of visual quality to compression ratio. It was great, and we thought we had something.</p>

</div>
<p>But trying to get people to adapt a new file format was way harder than we originally thought, it was nearly impossible. No one wants to download a codec (that handles decompression) to open their images, even if it’s anything open source – let alone a proprietary one. We figured this out early on, and knew that if we were to make something substantial in the compression space, it had to be about taking an existing standard and improving on it, rather than creating a completely new one.</p>
<p>JPEG, first introduced to the world almost 3 decades ago, is still the most widely used image compression standard in the world. It is surprisingly simple, yet extremely effective. We figured if we needed to create something for the masses, it needed to be JPEG. This is when we began our work in improving JPEG with ML. In this blog post, I’ll detail the process we took, and how we ultimately created the best image compression algorithm there is.</p>
<h2>Enter JPEG</h2>
<p>To really understand how we can bring ML to JPEG, we’d need to start with JPEG itself and understand how JPEG compresses images. For a given image, the following explains how the JPEG algorithm works:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, the image is broken in to 8×8, non-overlapping blocks</li>
<li>Then for each 8×8 block, the algorithm:
<ul>
<li>Converts the color space to YUV</li>
<li>Performs subsampling on the UV channels (In case for 4:2:0 for example)</li>
<li>Applies the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)</li>
<li>Quantizes using a Q-Table</li>
<li>Entropy codes to obtain a bit string</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lastly, this bit string (each per block of 8×8), together with metadata (such as the Q-Table) comprises the JPEG file.</li>
</ul>
<p>The JPEG decoder, on the other hand, performs the above in reverse to reconstruct the image. If we take the output after quantization, perform de-quantization (basically by multiplying element-wise with the Q-Table) followed by an Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform (IDCT), and convert the color space back to RGB, then we end up with 8×8 blocks of the original image. To go into more depth into how the JPEG compression works, refer to the following articles:</p>
<ol>
<li>https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-jpg-works-a4dbd2316f35/</li>
<li>https://medium.com/breaktheloop/jpeg-compression-algorithm-969af03773da</li>
</ol>
<h2>Enter Machine Learning</h2>
<p>So how do we go about improving this process with Machine Learning? When you take a step back, you realize that the above computational steps can be executed in tensor-flowy fashion.&nbsp; Take an image, say of dimensions (a, b, 3), and create 8×8 patches of it (N, 8, 8, 3), N being the number of patches. (It helps if the image dimensions are divisible by 8, otherwise zero-padding would do. Anyway, details don’t matter much here, let’s focus image flow for now).&nbsp; On each 8×8 patch, we apply DCT, followed by a quantization step. A dequantization step&nbsp; followed by IDCT will yield back the original color space.</p>
<p>Now, if we had trainable parameters, we can imagine this process as a flow of a tensor, and use a framework like TensorFlow to code the model. You can then start training it with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and optimize the network for MS-SSIM, for example.</p>
<p>Quantization in the JPEG algorithm consists of two operations. The first is to divide the numbers element-wise using a table commonly referred to as a Q-Table. This division is then followed by rounding to the nearest integer (to convert from floating-point numbers after DCT to integers in order to save space).</p>
<p>What we realized was, all the meaningful compression in the JPEG algorithm happens at this Quantization step – it is when the output of the DCT gets divided by the Q-Table. If we then use a neural network to approximate the best Q-Table possible, while guaranteeing a minimum MS-SSIM score, we have a winner.</p>
<p>Compression.ai’s newest JPEG compression engine was built using this concept. At its heart, we have a neural network outputting the best Q-Table guaranteeing the smallest output files size for the highest MS-SSIM score, tailored for each and every input image. A super fast implementation of the traditional JPEG compression algorithm is then used to create the final output image file.</p>
<p>So there you go. There’s a peak into the machine learning side of our algorithms.</p>

                <section>
                    <p>Aaron Tilley of the Wall Street Journal has an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-pandemic-forces-businesses-to-confront-cloud-computing-costs-11595849519">interesting piece</a> (paywalled) today that speaks to one of the challenges that businesses are facing on the pandemic related technology front. The net of it is that companies are spending more and more on cloud costs, sometimes independent of their business outcomes. It doesn't compute long term. <br></p><p>More importantly, we think this moment signals a shift, with the pendulum swinging in the direction of the private cloud. The direction of repatriation. &nbsp;<br></p><p>We are not suggesting that the public cloud is a phenomenon. On the contrary, it has established itself as one of the foundational components of the enterprise technology stack. It is a multi-billion dollar business for nearly a dozen companies, led most famously by the exceptionally talented and driven team at Amazon. Their web services business generates $40 billion per year, and while the S3 business represents the lion’s share of the revenue, there are valuable services that continue to proliferate, reducing AWS’s exposure to that line of business.</p><p>Why did the cloud become so ubiquitous so quickly?</p><ol><li><strong>Simplicity</strong> – AWS and others made it simple to solve problems. Need compute? Done. Need storage? Done. Want to add to that storage? Done. Want to analyze the data inside that storage? Done. The public cloud dramatically reduced the friction associated with cloud and shifted the balance of power to the developer community and away from IT.</li><li><strong>Elasticity</strong> – The public cloud offered a novel model: pay for what you need, when you need it. The concept of spinning up storage and compute and then spinning it down was entirely new and offered an attractive alternative to sunk costs and over-provisioning.</li><li><strong>A Microservices Mentality</strong> – One of the least appreciated implications of the cloud is that it came ready with an unbelievably rich catalog of applications, services and APIs that dramatically accelerated the development of data rich applications.</li></ol><p>While these themes powered the rise of the public cloud, they are not fundamentally competitive differentiators. That is to say, that the same attributes can be replicated on other public cloud options and more notably the private cloud, with a number of other benefits. Specifically, on the private cloud you get:<br></p><ol><li><strong>Security</strong> – While the public cloud offers an increasing array of security options, it suffers from some key gaps, namely complexity and management.</li><li><strong>Performance</strong> – As we have noted in many of our <a href="https://blog.min.io/tag/benchmarks/">benchmark papers</a>, the public cloud is plenty fast. Object storage is the primary storage platform in the public cloud for a reason: it offers superior throughput, albeit higher latency. For data-rich applications and analytics, this is the ideal tradeoff. In the private cloud, proximity comes into play and delivers better performance than the public cloud at a fraction of the cost. This is a function of how expensive bandwidth is compared to storage.</li><li><strong>Cost</strong> – Ultimately, the public cloud, for all its benefits, doesn’t deliver cost saving at scale. This is what is driving the <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3532030/cloud-repatriation-rescues-cios-from-mounting-costs.html">repatriation phenomenon</a> for large enterprises and keeping other ones <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bank-of-americas-350-million-internal-cloud-bet-striking-payoff-2019-10?IR=T">out of the cloud.</a> The ease of spinning up an instance, coupled with the ease of forgetting about it, results in massive bills. If your enterprise is dealing with petabytes the economics favor the private cloud.</li></ol><p>Having said that there are some good reasons a company <em><strong>should</strong></em> move the public cloud. The answer is to learn. To develop cloud-native muscle. To change the DNA of your organization.</p><p>Once you have achieved that, you come back to the private cloud – to run your business at scale. Let’s explore that concept a little further:</p><ul><li><strong>Move Out of Your Comfort Zone</strong> – There are a number of skills you will never learn from sliding another blade into the rack and seeing it come up on your “single pane of glass”. This is not an insult to IT admins, as they have significant amounts of tribal knowledge that are immensely valuable. Further, the success of the blade vendors is predicated on making things simple. None of those blade vendors want to talk about Kubernetes, containers or programming skills or databases - but those are the components of the public cloud and they have to be mastered. What better place to do it than the cloud, where sampling different software solutions is as easy as cruising the marketplace.</li><li><strong>Cloud-Native Muscle</strong> – The cloud-native mentality is fundamentally different from the traditional IT mentality. The traditional IT mentality is about hardware appliances, integration testing, validation and labs. The cloud-native mentality is about software, applications, containerization, orchestration, APIs and microservices. The cloud-native way is to rapidly assemble infrastructure, applications and workflows, and then deploy that in the service of a business problem. The cloud-native way is the future. Kubernetes is the dominant model in the build/package/deploy framework. It was designed for the cloud-native world that we now live in. These are the skills that a modern enterprise needs to develop. Learning them in the traditional IT framework makes no sense. Moving to the cloud demands that the organization master the cloud-native skill set because that is the only skill set that works there.</li><li><strong>Understand Scaling</strong> – In the public cloud, simple scales, failure domains are kept small and building blocks represent the way things are built. Massive, monolithic systems don’t exist. Massive systems exist, just ask the CIOs with 8-figure AWS bills, but they are composed of smaller blocks. The basic premise of cloud-native architecture, whether it is for compute or storage, is to consume resources in small, discrete chunks. As you scale, you add additional instances and pack them as densely as possible in your infrastructure instead of scaling one instance up infinitely.</li><li><strong>Internalize Simplicity</strong> – One of the great gifts of the cloud is simplicity: the ability to <a href="https://min.io/pricing">start with a credit card</a>, to provision infrastructure with a click of the mouse, to add products and services. Simple wins in the cloud. For too long, IT used complexity as a method of control. Only certain, credentialed and certified individuals were given the keys to the castle. In the cloud, simple wins. If your app or service is simple to provision and deploy, more people will adopt it. Like water, consumers choose the path of least resistance. Simple does not mean lacking in features or power. Simple is often more powerful than complex – it just takes more effort to deliver the experience. Simplicity democratizes data. Every organization wants to democratize data – they need to learn its secrets and apply them at scale.</li></ul><p>Good? Now apply at scale.<br></p><p>As noted, the public cloud is an amazing place to learn but not an amazing place to scale – unless of course, you are the landlord (AWS, GCP, Azure, Alibaba). The place to scale is on the private cloud, using the same technologies that you used on the public cloud: S3 storage, dense compute, high-speed networking, Kubernetes, containers and microservices. <br></p><p>This offers the ideal mix of operational costs, flexibility and control. It is true that you will take on CapEx, but by starting small and taking advantage of key cloud lessons (elasticity and scaling by components) enterprises can minimize the initial outlay and maximize the operationational savings.<br></p><p>The net effect is to drive superior TCO and ROI through the private cloud. <br></p><p>So go to the public cloud and learn the “way of the cloud” then apply it on-prem. That is where the economics, control and security reign supreme. <br></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've wanted to join YC for the last 8 years. I've applied to and been rejected by YC three times.</p><p>But when we got into YC with <a href="http://zmurl.com/">ZmURL</a>, we turned it down. Here’s why…</p><h2 id="yc-as-an-employee">YC as an Employee</h2><p>I first learned about YC in 2012 from <a href="https://twitter.com/zebulgar">a friend</a> who was obsessed with startups. Soon, all of my smartest friends were dropping out of school to do YC. In 2014, I joined them by bailing on an internship to work for <a href="http://picnichealth.com/">Picnic Health</a> as they went through YC S14.</p><p>That summer I lived in a house in Redwood City with the rest of the team. YC forced us to focus and make progress each week. This culminated in Demo Day which allowed us to raise a seed round without much real traction.</p><figure><img src="https://assets.contents.io/asset_8nvbj2oFDnwe9iRc.jpg" alt="The Picnic Health team after graduating from a house in Redwood City to a real office in the Mission District of SF."><figcaption>The Picnic Health team after graduating from a house in Redwood City to a real office in the Mission District of SF.</figcaption></figure><p>At my mom's urging, I left Picnic Health to finish college, but that summer left a lasting impression. After graduating and joining <a href="http://benchling.com/">Benchling</a> (another YC startup), I watched jealously as friends started companies and got into YC.</p><h2 id="rejected-rejected-rejected-accepted">Rejected, Rejected, Rejected, Accepted</h2><p>After leaving Benchling to start my own company, I quickly learned that starting a company was much harder than expected. I applied to YC and got rejected. Rinse and repeat. I ended up starting 3 companies and getting rejected from YC three times.</p><figure><img src="https://assets.contents.io/asset_eGdhBVmpHcqwD4nj.png" alt="Here I am after interviewing for (and getting rejected from) YC with Scooter Map."><figcaption>Here I am after interviewing for (and getting rejected from) YC with <a href="https://scootermap.com/">Scooter Map</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>This March, as COVID spread in the US, I stayed up late talking with <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/danqing_liu">Danqing</a> about what we could do to help. From these conversations, we built <a href="http://zmurl.com/">ZmURL</a> to help <a href="https://zmurl.com/whit2">a friend of mine</a> sell tickets to her Zoom Yoga classes.</p><p>In just a week, ZmURL went from an idea to being <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/03/how-to-prevent-zoombombing/">featured on TechCrunch</a>. To keep up with the growth, we focused on building product 7 days a week. For one weekend we took a break to lift our heads up, talk about the future, and to apply to YC.</p><p>To my surprise, after getting rejected three times, we got into YC for the current batch. Even more surprisingly, after weighing our options, we decided to turn down YC.</p><p>I realized that we applied to YC just because it was "the thing to do" and that YC is no longer the right fit for every startup. </p><figure><img src="https://assets.contents.io/asset_dTo3agVed4ANcClE.png" alt="The ZmURL team in NYC meeting in person for the second time ever."><figcaption>The ZmURL team in NYC meeting in person for the second time ever.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-benefits-of-yc">The Benefits of YC</h2><p>Before explaining why we turned down YC, it's helpful to know what makes YC so awesome. From going thru YC with Picnic Health, YC helped us with:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Coursework</strong> — Learn how to startup. Attend inspirational dinners.</p></li><li><p><strong>Accountability</strong> — You're forced to deliver results every week. Compete with your batchmates.</p></li><li><p><strong>Network</strong> — Bond with other smart founders. Reach out to YC alums</p></li><li><p><strong>Branding</strong> — YC is cool, it's cool to be part of YC.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sales Leads</strong> — If you are selling to startups, YC is full of them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fundraising</strong> — Demo Day builds buzz and FOMO.</p></li></ul><h2 id="yc-without-yc">YC Without YC</h2><p>Today, many of these benefits can be gained without joining YC while other aspects of YC have gotten worse due to the increased the batch size.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Coursework</strong> — YC has open sourced <a href="https://www.startupschool.org/">Startup School</a> and <a href="https://startupclass.samaltman.com/">Startup Class</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Accountability</strong> — Write a <a href="https://victor.pont.is/article/weekly-update">weekly update</a> to friends or post your progress to Twitter.</p></li><li><div><p><strong>Network</strong> — Join an early stage startup. Meet interesting people online.</p><p>I was able to build an invaluable network of mentors over the past 5 years working at startups and starting companies in San Francisco. I've made interesting friends from posting on Twitter and reaching out just to chat with interesting people. (See Tweet below.)</p></div></li><li><p><strong>Branding</strong> — You can build a personal brand by writing online, but the YC brand is very good.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sales Leads</strong> — If you aren't selling to startups, you don't benefit as much from YC’s network.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fundraising</strong> — From the founders I've talked to, the first remote Demo Day failed. This could have been due to COVID, so it'll be interesting to see how the next Demo Day goes...</p></li></ul><figure><img src="https://assets.contents.io/asset_3qWItqVzC2aoeI6N.png" alt="I've met friends, investors, and mentors on Twitter. In March, this Tweet led to Techcrunch covering the launch of ZmURL."><figcaption>I've met friends, investors, and mentors on Twitter. In March, this Tweet led to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/03/how-to-prevent-zoombombing/">Techcrunch covering the launch of ZmURL</a>.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="who-should-do-yc">Who Should do YC</h2><p>YC is still the best tech accelerator and they are doing amazing work to make starting companies more accessible. YC is a great fit for you if are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>A Tech Outsider</strong> — YC helps you meet other founders and can introduce you to any VC.</p></li><li><p><strong>Selling to Startups</strong> — Stripe, Segment, Gusto, and Brex grew quickly by selling to other YC companies. As a YC founder, it's easy to reach out to alums and pitch them, although this is getting worse as the large batch sizes dilute the network.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hungry for Prestige</strong> — YC used to be for outsiders. "Why would you start a company instead of work for Google?" But now joining YC is cool, so it's a valuable stop on the Harvard → McKinsey → MBA trajectory. (This has also contributed to YC's dilution.)</p></li></ul><p>While increasing the batch size is the right thing for YC (and for the world), it's made the experience worse for founders who get less facetime with partners and end up directly competing with batchmates. While YC told us there wouldn't be competitors in our batch, we've already seen at least 3 very similar companies in the current YC batch...</p><p>After weighing our options, we decided to skip YC and to try to raise a seed round. I'll talk about how that went in my next post...</p></div></div>]]>

July 28, 2020 | https://numinous.productions/timeful/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://numinous.productions/timeful/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<img src="https://numinous.productions/timeful/images/rightFloat1.png" role="presentation">
			<p>The most powerful books reach beyond their pages—beyond those few hours in which they’re read—and indelibly transform how serious readers see the world. Few books achieve such transcendent impact, yet given their physical constraints, it’s remarkable that any do. As a medium, books have no direct means of communicating with readers over time. The physical text is stuck on the page, generally read linearly and continuously in a few sittings.</p>
			<img src="https://numinous.productions/timeful/images/rightFloat1.png" role="presentation">
			<p>To be transformed by a book, readers must do more than absorb information: they must bathe in the book’s ideas, relate those ideas to experiences in their lives over weeks and months, try on the book’s mental models like a new hat. Unfortunately, readers must drive that process for themselves. Authors can’t easily guide this ongoing sense-making: their words are stuck on pages which have already been read. How might one create a medium which does the job of a book, but which escapes a book’s shackled sense of time? How might one create <em>timeful texts</em>—texts with affordances extending the authored experience over weeks and months, texts which continue the conversation with the reader as they slowly integrate those ideas into their lives?</p>
			
			<p>Each year, hundreds of thousands of students study <em>Molecular Biology of the Cell</em>. The text presents endless facts and figures, but its goal is not simply to transmit reference material. The book aspires to convey a strong sense of how to think like a cell biologist—a way of looking at questions, at phenomena, and at oneself. For example, it contains nuanced discussions of microscopy techniques, but readers can’t meaningfully try on those ways of thinking while they’re reading. Readers must carry this book’s ideas into their daily interactions in the lab, watching for moments which relate to the exercises or which give meaning to the authors’ advice.<img src="https://numinous.productions/timeful/images/leftFloat1.png" role="presentation"> This model of change is brittle: the right situation must arise while the book is still fresh in readers’ minds; they must notice the relevance of the situation; they must remember the book’s details; they must reflect on their experience and how it relates to the book’s ideas; and so on.</p>
			<p>As we consider alternative approaches, we can find inspiration in the world’s most transformative books. Consider texts like the Bible and the Analects of Confucius. People integrate ideas from those books into their lives over time—but not because authors designed them that way. Those books work because they’re surrounded by rich cultural activity. Weekly sermons and communities of practice keep ideas fresh in readers’ minds and facilitate ongoing connections to lived experiences. This is a powerful approach for powerful texts, requiring extensive investment from readers and organizers. We can’t build cathedrals for every book. Sophisticated readers adopt similar methods to study less exalted texts, but most people lack the necessary skills, drive, and cultural contexts. How might we design texts to more widely enable such practices?</p>
			<img src="https://numinous.productions/timeful/images/leftFloat2.png" role="presentation">
			<p>Guided meditation smartphone apps offer a promising design approach. Meditation’s insights unfold slowly. Aspirants are typically advised to practice daily. Over weeks and months, they may begin to experience the world differently. Some concepts in meditation make no sense if you still can’t perceive your breath clearly, so they’re best introduced later. A book on meditation isn’t well-suited to this kind of slow unfurling: much of it may not make sense initially; readers will need to re-read it again and again as their practice progresses. But a guided meditation app’s experience is naturally spread over time. Each day’s session begins and ends with brief instruction. Instructors offer topical prompts throughout the practice. Intermittent repetition can keep old ideas active in students’ minds until they’re ready to engage. Rather than delivering a bound monograph on meditation, instructors can slowly unfurl an idea over hundreds of days. Critically, these apps are a mass medium, just as books are: lessons can be “written” once and redistributed cheaply to huge audiences. Could this approach be applied more generally?</p>
			<img src="https://numinous.productions/timeful/images/leftFloat3.png" role="presentation">
			<p>To engage with a book’s ideas over time, readers must remember its details, and <a href="https://andymatuschak.org/books">that’s already a challenge</a>. One promising solution lies in <a href="https://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">spaced repetition memory systems</a>, which allow users to retain large quantities of knowledge reliably and efficiently. Like meditation, these systems involve a daily practice: every day, a reader maintains their memory library by reviewing a few dozen lightweight prompts. Each prompt asks a detailed question, like “What types of stimuli does George Miller’s span of absolute judgment describe?” Each day’s session is different because each prompt repeats on its own schedule. When a user remembers or forgets the answer to a prompt, the system expands or contracts that prompt’s repetition interval along an exponential curve. These expanding intervals allow readers to maintain a collection of thousands of prompts while reviewing only a few dozen each day. Practitioners generally complete their review sessions in moments which would otherwise go unused, like when waiting in line.</p>
			<img src="https://numinous.productions/timeful/images/timeline.png" alt="This figure illustrates pages of a book being presented along a timeline of expanding intervals.">
			<p>Despite their efficacy, these systems are not yet widely adopted. One important barrier to adoption is that it’s surprisingly difficult to write good prompts. To explore one potential solution, we created an experimental quantum computing textbook, <em><a href="https://quantum.country/">Quantum Country</a></em>. It’s written in a “<a href="https://numinous.productions/ttft/">mnemonic medium</a>,” interleaving expert-authored spaced repetition prompts into the reading experience. Our goal was to help readers engage with challenging technical material by supporting their memory. <img src="https://numinous.productions/timeful/images/rightFloat2.png" role="presentation">As we interviewed readers, though, we noticed that the regular review sessions didn’t just build detailed retention: the ongoing practice also changed readers’ relationship to the material by maintaining their contact with it over time. These people didn’t just read the book once and proceed with their lives. <em>Quantum Country</em>’s review sessions returned readers to its ideas again and again over weeks and months.</p>
			<p><em>Quantum Country</em>’s prompts are designed to help readers remember technical material, but it may be possible to adapt similar mechanisms to support future timeful texts.</p>
			<p>Consider <em>The Elements of Style</em>, a classic writing primer by Strunk and White. The authors demonstrate the value of parallel construction with this example from the Bible: “Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.” But it’s not enough to read an example. Good writers’ ears become automatically alert to these constructions. They notice opportunities to create parallelisms, and they notice dissonance when similar phrases are presented differently. It takes time to develop this awareness.</p>
			<p>What if, a week after learning about parallel construction, a reader’s review session included this prompt?</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>The following quote has been modified to remove a parallel construction. How might you rewrite it to add parallel construction? How do the two differ in effect?</p>
				<p>“My fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you. Instead, reflect on what you can contribute to these United States.” (modified from a quote by John F. Kennedy, which would be revealed in its original form once the reader had finished with the prompt)</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>A week or two later, a similar prompt might appear with a different distorted quote. For example: “You can fool all the people some of the time, and you can mislead many listeners consistently. But you won’t be able to fool everyone reliably.” (adapted from Abraham Lincoln)</p>
			<p>Such prompts might seem onerous or strange on their own, but what if most educated people maintained a regular review practice of the kind we’ve described? The example reflection prompt would sit between others on physics, poetry, and whatever else you’d been thinking about. If you found the prompt useful, it would recur in another week; if not, perhaps it would reappear in a few months. A book like <em>The Elements of Style</em> might include dozens or hundreds of prompts like these on various topics, so that you’d see one or two each day over weeks and months as you integrate its ideas into the way you view and practice writing.</p>
			<p>In early chapters of <em>Quantum Country</em>, readers see every prompt as they read the text, and the prompts remain the same in the ensuing review sessions. But in the final chapter, we added a new kind of prompt which changes over time in a programmed sequence. Perhaps future timeful texts could unfurl their contents over the course of many sessions, much as we observed that digital meditation lessons do.</p>
			<p>Of course, spaced repetition is just one approach for writing timeful texts. What other powerful tools might it be possible to create, making future books into artifacts that transcend their pages, as they slowly help readers shape their lives?</p>

One even sees increasing talk about the need for better online social networks — ones that foster positive human experience and development, reasonable thinking and imaginative creation.</p><p id="a079">What I haven’t yet seen, however, is much real understanding of why our current online social networks are the way they are, and what might be done to fix them.</p><p id="46c1">What we need to create a better social network, in my view, is relatively straightforward to state:</p><p id="eb94"><strong>1.</strong> Code should be open source.</p><p id="e4af"><strong>2. </strong>Ownership and control should be decentralized… so there is no company and no government tasked and burdened with calling all the shots. Embedding blockchain technologies deep in the technical design of the network is the right way to achieve this.</p><p id="f752"><strong>3.</strong> Major decisions should be made democratically. If some group systematically doesn’t like the outcomes votes are getting, they can fork the code and make a new version, or copy the code and create a new network using the same software.</p><p id="d04a"><strong>4.</strong> Recommendations of connections and content should be made using AI that has the ability to explain the reasons behind its judgments — and these explanations need to be shown routinely to users in a way they can understand.</p><p id="c2c7">Due to SingularityNET and a variety of other recent developments, we already have the basic technologies needed to support this sort of approach — as far as tech is concerned, we could have decentralized, democratic, transparent and ethical alternatives to Facebook Twitter, LinkedIn, TikTok and so forth right now. We even have some existing websites — such as <a href="http://minds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">minds.com</a> — embodying significant parts of the above.</p><p id="ab48">What we still don’t have — yet! — is the alignment of resources to get alternatives fulfilling all four of the above points fully built-out … and then pushed toward wide adoption.</p><p id="6e32">In this essay, I’m going to dig a bit into the collective-psychology implications of current centralized social networks and future potential decentralized alternatives. Given the key role that social networks currently play in channelling, guiding and crystallizing collective human thought and emotion, these are not just issues regarding the infrastructure of a particular technology sector — they may actually be critical to the future path of humanity.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2576/1*pzRyZbUayGqqpqpmUC6eFw.png" width="1288" height="709" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*pzRyZbUayGqqpqpmUC6eFw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*pzRyZbUayGqqpqpmUC6eFw.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*pzRyZbUayGqqpqpmUC6eFw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*pzRyZbUayGqqpqpmUC6eFw.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*pzRyZbUayGqqpqpmUC6eFw.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="7b1f">The current mode of organizing social networks presents companies like Facebook with seemingly unsolvable problems. Should Facebook take down racist posts? What about posts with indirect racist implications? Posts explicitly aimed at affecting political elections using false information? What about questionable information? What makes information “too questionable”?</p><p id="5947">In relatively free regions like e.g. the US or Western Europe, government’s role in modulating public speech is restricted to extreme cases of directly dangerous speech (directly advocating violence, explicit forms of “hate speech” etc.). I believe this is for the best, as the alternative of giving government stronger control over speech has glaringly obvious failure modes — i.e. it can be used by fascist-minded government leaders to squelch the public dialogue needed to organize opposition to their rule.</p><p id="19e4">However, less extreme, less directly dangerous instances of public speaking can also have a dramatic and systematically destructive impact on individual minds and the public mind — and in the current situation in the “free world”, these are being modulated by corporations in a very ad hoc way. And these corporations, run by digital marketing and tech geek types, are wholly unsuited to the subtle problem of modulating online information, knowledge and relationship flow for humanity. These organizations are optimized for delivering software and delivering ads and making money — not for guiding the public mind toward the broader good.</p><p id="dfa8">On the positive side, there are all sorts of brilliant ideas and wonderful creations being put out there on the Internet every minute of every day — but most of these have a hard time finding the audience they deserve because most of the currently widely operational information dissemination mechanisms are oriented toward corporate profit maximization rather than general human (or transhuman!) benefit maximization.</p><p id="8343">So given that it’s best to keep governments out of the modulation of non-extreme, not-directly-dangerous public speech — and given also that corporations running social media networks are not well suited for the job — then what can we do?</p><p id="fb1f">What we can do, of course, is roll out information and relationship coordination systems that allow the community of individuals engaged in social networks to carry out intelligent information and relationship management themselves — via their explicit judgments and decisions, and their implicit actions.</p><p id="2b59">SingularityNET’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03857.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weighted liquid rank reputation system</a> is one tool designed to help with this — it provides a framework for leveraging data regarding user behaviours to estimate the reputation or value that a given user assigned to another person or an information source or piece of information. Using tools like this, each person guides what information they see, based on AI algorithms calibrated for their own benefit rather than the benefit of corporations seeking to profit from them.</p><p id="82b6">You can learn more this here <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1902/1902.03857.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weighted liquid rank reputation systems for marketplaces</a>, also on the following <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.singularitynet.io/computing-reputation-for-discourse-users-with-aigents-25b806277e74]">Discourse forums</a>.</p><p id="c6ed">But how can people know these AI algorithms are acting for their own benefit? Transparent and explainable AI is another key ingredient here. SingularityNET reputation system can leverage either opaque or transparent AI for making predictions of how much a given user will appreciate a given other person, source or datum. Embedding neural-symbolic AI into the reputation system is one strategy that can enable a reasonable degree of explainability, as symbolic patterns can generally be simplified and rearranged into explainable form via automated transformations.</p><p id="5a97">Creating analogues of modern social networks architected according to the above principles would not be incredibly hard given available technologies. There would be a lot of engineering required, but mankind is now capable of doing a lot of engineering.</p><p id="51c0">The essential reason fair and democratic and non-stupid large-scale social networks built along these lines do not exist, is that nobody with adequate financial resources has wanted to put in the money to build one.</p><p id="81c9">One may ask why such a thing hasn’t just been created by volunteer OSS developers or entrepreneurial devs. One core issue is that such a social network framework would only be valuable once it had a lot of users. Because of this, the reality or perception is that getting such a project off the ground at this stage — with huge entrenched centralized competitors — would require a massive marketing budget.</p><p id="fa00">I would love to see SingularityNET and OpenCog used as foundational tools for the implementation and operation of this sort of social network, and would welcome partnerships with other groups interested to collaborate on this sort of work.</p><p id="40ff">But what I want to explore a little more here in this article are some of the subtler reasons why <strong><em>transparency, explainability and decentralization are so important in social network construction</em></strong>.</p><p id="c6a9">I’m going to get a little theoretical here — but before long I’ll get back to the practical.</p><p id="9d73">How and why did our social networks become this way?</p><p id="d63e">Of course, the profit motive underlying the companies that build and operate these social networks — Facebook, Twitter and the rest — is part of the problem. The goal of the social network becomes maximum addictiveness because this is the most straightforward way to maximize profit in this particular business niche … and human psychology being what it is, the way to achieve maximum addictiveness is to appeal to a mix of emotions in a rather perverse way.</p><p id="df6a">Much as junk food perverts our taste and smell system to create unhealthy addictive food experiences of a sort that didn’t exist in the Paleolithic environment we evolved for, similarly, current social networks pervert our social, cognitive and emotional systems to create unhealthy addictive informational and relational experiences of a sort that didn’t exist before Internet tech came along.</p><p id="2f30">But the drive to profit from maximum addictiveness is only one of the more proximal aspects of the problem.

<figcaption>Ma Yuan, Scholar Viewing a Waterfall</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Georges Dumézil in his 1929 book Flamen-Brahman proposed that Proto-Indo-European society was divided into three distinct social groups: The productive class, which practiced agriculture, pastoralism, and artisanship; the martial class, which waged war and defended the tribe; and the sovereign class, wielding authority both juridicial and spiritual, whose place it was to rule. As societies grew more complex and division of labor became more granular, further specializations came to be recognized, but they remained grounded in the original tripartite: worker, warrior, and priest.</p>

<p>The earliest incarnation of the priestly class made sense of the chaos of the natural world, locating agency in what appeared to be random processes. They performed rituals in an effort to beseech or control the spirits or gods that governed the land. They read the auspices by which the gods made their will known to mortals. They served as the memory of a people and enacted judgment against transgressors.</p>

<p>The priestly role is, in a word, systematization. Their chief purpose is to construct the reality in which their adherents live. They provide order and grounding, defining the base truths those of a society take axiomatically. It is on these axioms that all else is built.</p>

<p>It is customary to divide the history of communication into four periods: oral, manuscript, print, and electronic. Systems native to each period were in large part defined by the the means they provided to catalog and disseminate information. Writing enabled the development of institutions of knowledge unbound by the limits of memory and generational transmission, marking a shift from teaching and knowing to study and interpretation. Print allowed for texts to be distributed to the masses directly rather than dictated by an intermediary and enlisted their participation in the act of interpreting. The internet now is the means by which anyone may author and transmit their own texts unencumbered by previous physical constraints.</p>

<p>The Church in the manuscript era constructed a shared reality, a substratum of truth binding its members together and which they sought to recruit all peoples into, which we may call Christendom. The Reformation, waxing alongside print, irrevocably destroyed this framework; however, the Protestant faiths by nature could never provide the same unity of purpose. Instead, the writers who reformulated concepts such as rights and sovereignty such that they could stand alone, as axioms, laid the groundwork for the new reality to follow. In this way secularism, republicanism, and such can be seen neither as a salve for the century of bloodshed the Reformation inaugurated, nor as the culmination of the ideas Luther put forward. Rather, they formed a distinct set of beliefs competing for and eventually winning preeminence in lands Catholic and Protestant alike over a longer, multi-century period of religious war. This worldview likewise energizes its adherents to spread it across the globe, and it remains the most powerful and widespread meaning-making system to this day, commanding the mass of peoples that we may call the Public.</p>

<p>With the internet, we are in the early stages of its destruction. The trend from the rotary press to the television was cohesion, toward a unitary Public. The trend for the past two and a half decades has been one of fragmentation, a diffusion of various publics. Just as the Church formed the basis of people's understanding of themselves and the society they lived in in the era of the manuscript, and the press did the same in the era of print, a new mode is emerging shaped by present technology.</p>

<p>The major platforms at present incentivize the profusion of cloistered micro-communities, exchanging ideas among themselves and with their immediate neighbors that come to form their own realities inscrutable to outsiders. This is not a necessary consequence of the underlying technology, but rather the result of design decisions made by the programmers who author these systems. Discourse over how platforms "ought" to function tends to focus on a tension between the desire of tech companies to operate as simple businesses disinterested in higher questions against a perceived necessity for them to fill the role once occupied by the press as defenders of liberal democracy. This framing, however, misses the wealth of options available beyond letting events run their course or stemming the unwinding of the present order. A programmer class conscious of its potential to fill the now-vacant priestly role could leverage this position for arbitrary ends, design its systems to shape the reality of its choosing. Whether one finds this intriguing or frightening is a matter of taste.</p>

<p>❧</p>

<p>Before there was writing, there was speech. Orality is best regarded as a technology in its own right, with its own techniques and affordances. In contrast to a common view of oral culture as necessarily egalitarian and collaborative, the priestly role, concerned with narration and preservation of societal memory, was a specialized one. The guru-shishya system of preserving the Vedas was the most highly developed form and serves as a testament to the possibility for thoroughness without relying on the written word. Students learned various recitations, or pathas, of the corpus—continuous, word-by-word, with or without euphonic combinations—and their consonance served as a built-in form of error-checking. Phonology was standardized as the Vedic pitch accent, sidestepping the problem many traditions have with linguistic drift. Putting the Vedas to paper was later done almost as an afterthought.</p>

<p>Most cultures were not nearly as thorough or organized, however, and over time many traditions drifted or diverged from their original forms. Especially in times of upheaval, there are no caches of texts to rediscover after the crisis abates. Tellers must simply make do with what they are given, and indeed the kernel of a shared tradition can often be found in wildly divergent bodies of knowledge from cultures cleaved from each other by distance, war, or time.</p>

<p>The advent of written language allowed oral cultures to be centralized and canonized, relieving the burdens and lossiness of memory. Traditions were made into texts, singular and authoritative. Externalizing memory to papyrus or parchment enormously expanded the scope of what could be retained. It also eliminated the necessity for exactitude and endless repetition when instructing students, allowing for a stronger focus on meaning and interpretation.</p>

<p>Socrates called writing "the appearance of wisdom, not true wisdom" in a dialogue with Phaedrus, remarking that it enabled surface-level understandings and made up for deficiencies of recall. He goes on however to make a rather subtler point:</p>

<blockquote> Writing, Phaedrus, has this strange quality, and is very like painting; for the creatures of painting stand like living beings, but if one asks them a question, they preserve a solemn silence. And so it is with written words; you might think they spoke as if they had intelligence, but if you question them, wishing to know about their sayings, they always say only one and the same thing. And every word, when once it is written, is bandied about, alike among those who understand and those who have no interest in it, and it knows not to whom to speak or not to speak; when ill-treated or unjustly reviled it always needs its father to help it; for it has no power to protect or help itself.</blockquote>

<p>Writing, he argues, cannot elaborate on its meaning any further than what is written, a quality unlike that of a speaker. But where Socrates sees this as an objective deficiency, it instead comes to serve as a defining characteristic of the written word. With no necessity for chain of transmission from author to student, independent interpretation and commentary become central to text. Where the priesthoods of orality focused on memory, the priesthoods of the manuscript monopolized meaning.</p>

<p>As the Vedic guru-shishya traditions exemplify a structure defined by orality, Catholic Christianity serves as one shaped by the manuscript. Catholicism had since its institutionalization with the conversion of Constantine, been intensely hierarchical and strictly focused on the precision of doctrine. Many of its major controversies centered on theological disagreements by the clergy on unsettled questions of interpretation. In contrast to explicitly outsider folk movements such as the earlier gnostics or later medieval heresies, those pushing positions later declared anathema under labels such as Arianism, Nestorianism, or Monophysitism were insiders made into outsiders by conciliar fiat. The Great Schism, despite originating as a political dispute, became a dogmatic one as the two churches diverged, with East moving toward an experiential focus with theoria and hesychasm, while West embraced pagan philosophy and the austere studiousness defined of an emerging scholasticism.</p>

<p>Catholicism, in other words, evolved into a system organized around command structure and authoritative interpretation of texts exclusively done by the priestly class. As dogma proceeded down the hierarchy and completely excluded the input of the laity, much of the role of the clergy was to dictate to congregants passages of text and their proper meanings. The primary duty of lay members in Catholicism was to receive, in faith, the sacraments. Their access to and understanding of scripture was mediated by the figure of the priest, who offered narration during Mass and guidance during Penance. Lay Bible-reading was not only unnecessary for salvation but actively discouraged all the way until Vatican II, and to this day the practice is comparatively rare next to the Protestant traditions.</p>

<p>Being the educated class par excellence, the priesthood and the rulership were long intertwined. Pepin the Short, in concert with Pope Zachary, …</p></div></div>

Open source model architectures, while expensive to build and maintain, perform on par with big cloud provider options.</p><p>Unfortunately, each platform uses its own proprietary API and data format so it is very cumbersome to get started and compare solutions.

To do this efficiently, the AutoML services will boot up GPU nodes.</p><p><strong>Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Training Cost - </strong>Training is started and runs until the model has reached maximum performance. You are unable to control how long training occurs for. Training costs $1/hr/instance and Amazon may provision multiple compute instances to train your model. So your training job may complete in two hours but you will be billed for more if more instances were started. Training can run for a maximum of 72 node hours. If it times out, your training cost is refunded. Be careful, you cannot stop training jobs that have started! <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/pricing/">Pricing Page</a>.</p><p><strong>Google Cloud AutoML Vision Training Cost - </strong>Google Cloud AutoML Vision trains their model with 8 nodes with Tesla V100 GPUs. Each node hour is $3.15/hr, so ~$25 per wall clock hour. AutoML Vision allows you the ability to start, stop, and resume model training, which can be nice to anticipate the costs before the training job has started. There is no limit to the amount of training time you can provision in Google Cloud AutoML Vision. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/automl/pricing">Pricing Page</a>.</p><p><strong>Azure Custom Vision Training Cost - </strong>Azure Custom Vision is less verbose in explaining their training costs - it costs $20/compute hour, but the underlying hardware is undisclosed so it is unclear how this stacks up against the Google and Amazon price/performance. <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/">Pricing Page</a>.</p><h2 id="training-time">Training Time</h2><p>It is hard to benchmark training costs without factoring in training time. Each service may be running a larger or smaller model architecture, and may have varying levels of training time software optimization.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/ezgif.com-video-to-gif--10-.gif" alt=""><figcaption>Waiting for training to complete in Google Cloud AutoML Vision</figcaption></figure><p>When starting your training job, you have the ability to choose between large or compact models based on your downstream inference time needs in Azure and Google Cloud.

To make a fair comparison, we sought to use this as our training budget across platforms.</p><p><strong>Google Cloud AutoML Vision Training Time - </strong>To stick with with the Rekognition training cost baseline, we would need to use 9 node hours in Google Cloud AutoML Vision, but the minimum time allowed was 20 hours for our PascalVOC 2012 dataset, costing $60. The <strong>recommended</strong> training time was 1,080 node hours - which would have cost a whopping $3402. We chose to train for the minimum time allowed (which still cost &gt;2x Rekognition).</p><p><strong>Azure Custom Vision Training Time - </strong>Sticking with the Rekognition baseline, we provisioned 1 hour of training time for Azure Custom Vision, costing $20.</p><p>It is worth noting that Google Cloud AutoML Vision and Azure Custom Vision could have likely earned better evaluation performance with a larger training budget.

July 28, 2020 | https://solitaired.com/5-steps-that-decreased-our-bounce-rate-by-a-huge-41-percent | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://solitaired.com/5-steps-that-decreased-our-bounce-rate-by-a-huge-41-percent">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><center><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/bounce2.png"></center>
<p>When my mother in law told me the solitaire game she loved was no longer online, my friend and I thought that it might be a fun project to launch our own site. We had previously built a consumer business that reached 30M students yearly, and thought solitaire could be a fun playground to learn about gaming and even tie in and test concepts like mental stress and cognition. </p>
<p>We launched our <a href="https://solitaired.com/">free solitaire game</a> on Solitaired.com. </p>
<p>As users came in, we saw that our bounce rate averaged around 37%. â€œNot bad,â€� we thought. Most content sites had much higher bounce rates, and our past businesses that were optimized had bounce rates in that range. When we studied other gaming sites though using Similar Web, we saw that they had lower bounce rates. What if we can achieve something similar or better?</p>
<h2 id="1investigatingbrowserissuesmovingfrom37to34">1. Investigating browser issues: moving from 37% to 34%</h2>
<p>From past experience, we know getting our site to work across Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari is no easy feat. Each browser has its nuances, and even if our solitaire game works smoothly on one browser, it doesnâ€™t mean it will work smoothly on others. </p>
<p>Having quickly launched our solitaire site, MVP style, we hypothesized this may be a good place to look based on past experience. </p>
<p>Low and behold, we saw that Safari had a terrible 56% bounce rate. </p>
<p>When we loaded the game in the browser, we noticed that upon clicking the cards, they sometimes did not move as expected. It was a major bug!</p>
<p>We also saw that IE Explorer had an even worse bounce rate of 73%. </p>
<p>With IE Explorer being less than 1% of our traffic and being phased out for Edge, we decided not to invest our time there, and instead fix the Safari bug. </p>
<p>The result: bounce rate decreased by 8%, and dropped to an average of 34%!</p>
<h2 id="2optimizingmobileresponsivenessmovingfrom34to30">2. Optimizing mobile responsiveness: moving from 34% to 30%</h2>
<p><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/mobile.png"></p>
<p>We saw in our data that mobile users represented approximately 20% of our user base, so we knew that was a segment we needed to pay attention to. </p>
<p>When we looked at our mobile bounce rate in Google Analytics, it was well above our new average of 34%, hovering at 51%. That was clearly an issue. </p>
<p>We first saw in our vertical orientation on mobile that the cards were almost illegible. When we increased the size, mobile bounce rate improved meaningfully to 40%. </p>
<p>Still though, the cards were small because they were limited by the length of the phone in vertical orientation. </p>
<p>What if we optimized our horizontal orientation?</p>
<p>First, we made sure that when tilted horizontally, the cards would take up the entire screen, making the card interaction easier. Then, we created a graphic to encourage uses in vertical orientation to try horizontal orientation for a better experience. </p>
<p>The result: overall bounce rate dropped to 30%!</p>
<h2 id="3changingthecardbackmovingfrom30to28">3. Changing the card back: moving from 30% to 28%</h2>
<p><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/design2.png"></p>
<p>In our support center, a user asked if we could offer a better design for our card back. We reached out to this user, and asked why.</p>
<p>She said that our current design looked pixelated and didnâ€™t contract well with the green felt. Instead, a red card back that looked like a real card could be better, and indicate that our site was a high quality one. It was one of those insights where you kick yourself and say â€œduh.â€� </p>
<p>To be sure, we ran a user survey via hotjar showing a new card design. 71% of respondents said they preferred our current red card back on the site.</p>
<p>After making this change and our bounce rate decreased to an average of 28%</p>
<h2 id="4addingimportantfunctionalityandreducingbouncerateto26">4. Adding important functionality and reducing bounce rate to 26%</h2>
<p><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/Features.png"></p>
<p>In classic solitaire, there are two popular forms of games played. One is where you turn 1 card at a time over from the stockpile, and another where you turn 3 cards over from the stockpile. </p>
<p>We default to turn 1, but only in our all games menu did we link to the turn 3 options. </p>
<p>We hypothesized that many of our users wanted a turn 3 option, and may have been bouncing when they didnâ€™t see that immediately available. We ran a quick user survey via HotJar and which confirmed this, giving us confidence itâ€™s worth adding this to the game. We added a tab that allows you to flip between modes.</p>
<p>Not only did we see turn 3 solitaire play increase materially, but we further reduced our bounce rate to 26%. 
Whatâ€™s interesting is our users did not naturally write in saying they couldnâ€™t find turn 3. Those users who were looking for it likely just naturally bounced. We had to research and hypothesize to unearth this.</p>
<h2 id="5leveragingdatatodropthebouncerateto22">5. Leveraging data to drop the bounce rate to 22%</h2>
<p><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/getstarted.png"></p>
<p>Once we added Google event tracking to all our buttons, we were able to get insights into what features were most engaged, and it was eye opening. </p>
<p>It turned out that the hint button was a popular feature. In retrospect, it made sense. Itâ€™s easy to get stuck in solitaire, and undoing is the only way to get you back on track. </p>
<p>We found that after the new game and undo feature, this was the next most popular one, with 20% of our audience clicking it. </p>
<p>However, the hint was on the far right of our navigation. Knowing that internet users look at websites in an F-shaped pattern, this meant that some users who might be new to solitaire might not even notice this feature. If they donâ€™t know how to play, the hint feature is critical to getting them started.</p>
<p>We moved the hint button right after the undo button, closer to the left of the screen. We not only did this increase clicks on it by 25%, we reduced our bounce rate to 22%. Users who had to brush up on how to play solitaire suddenly had an easy way to do that.</p>
<h2 id="youcanalwaysimproveuserexperience">You can always improve user experience.</h2>
<p>Focusing on bounce rate is a great place to start when improving your site. Improving your bounce rate is the rising tide that lifts all business KPIs.</p>
<p>Start collecting data and try user tracking tools like HotJar to understand where there are opportunities to improve. Youâ€™ll be surprised by how much you can improve.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-3e42f2d53b29461b2add"><div><p>Magnetism is a common phenomenon for all, yet poorly understood by most. We become acquainted with magnetism from a very early age, maybe noticing that they’re used to pin photos and documents to the refrigerator by our parents or maybe we experience them as toys. Maybe we were lucky enough to experience magnetic sand at a science museum. If we were born in Japan, Germany, or Russia, we may have had first-hand experience with&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maglev#New_York,_United_States,_1968"><span>magnetically levitated trains</span></a>. In any event, we were each almost certainly astounded by our first encounter with magnets; a seemingly magical action-at-a-distance between two otherwise ordinary looking objects. If you can’t remember the feeling, watch&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/qI8AM8UM7kI?t=29"><span>this kid</span></a>.</p><div><p>But action-at-a-distance is not a matter of magic, it is a matter of physics. Our sense of wonder for magnets may turn to an inquiry into the science behind the familiar phenomenon. Perhaps that is what led you to this page. Unfortunately, as of this publication, the overwhelming majority of explanations for magnetic action terminate in one of two dead-ends. First, you will learn that atoms&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFAOXdXZ5TM"><span>are each tiny magnets</span></a>&nbsp;and so composite materials simply behave depending on the coordination of their subunits. This obviously punts the question of what makes the tiny magnets attract? For that line of inquiry, we are generally met with the second fatal roadblock:&nbsp;&nbsp;atoms interact magnetically due to magnetic fields. Of course, this explanation, however deep one dives into the mathematical descriptions of fields, begs the question: what&nbsp;<em>is</em>a magnetic field?</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field"><span>The magnetic field</span></a>&nbsp;of physics is a dynamic description — that is, it has both a shape and motion. This is evident from the basic unit of magnetic field strength, the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere"><span>ampere</span></a>/m. The ampere signifies charge per time and is the basic unit of current. Hence, a magnetic field is dynamic: it what some<em>thing</em>&nbsp;is doing. Therefore, in alternative to traditional visualizations, our explanation of magnetism begins not with an activity like a field but with an actor: the atom.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>Magnetism is presently understood as one side of a double-headed atomic phenomenon called electromagnetism. Electricity being the simpler of the two faces, it is all but imperative that you go back and&nbsp;<a href="https://demystifyingscience.com/blog/how-to-visualize-electricity"><span>read our work-up</span></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OakgcRuBBbg"><span>watch the animation</span></a>&nbsp;for visualizing electricity before proceeding here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you are short on time, I’ll provide you with an extremely brief re-cap. We integrate contemporary mathematical descriptions of electricity into an explanation that we believe improves upon traditional&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5XWeQuEhU4"><span>hydraulic</span></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rb9guSEeVE"><span>and electron-bead-flow</span></a>&nbsp;models.&nbsp;&nbsp;In brief, we illustrate the concept of charge through the rotation of atomic surfaces. These surfaces, called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.orbitals.com/orb/index.html"><span>electron shells (e-shell) or orbitals</span></a>, behave per quantum mechanical&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function"><span>electron wave functions</span></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Surface-to-surface transmission of e-shell rotation between aligned shells of atoms constitutes electricity. Although there are never electron beads moving along in our wire, our visualization of electricity is entirely consistent with modern mathematical representations. Current flow is merely reimagined as propagation of&nbsp;<em>in situ</em>&nbsp;e-shell surface rotation.&nbsp;</p></div><p>We utilize the simplest and most abundant atom, hydrogen, for our explanation of both electricity and magnetism, since it has only a single electron forming one e-shell orbital. We fashion a simple, hypothetical single-atom-thick wire from ionized hydrogen.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ionization indicates that the atoms electron surface is not localized by enmeshed with its neighbors.&nbsp;&nbsp;We can extend the electromagnetic principles applied to hydrogen across other more complex elements and molecules by the careful addition of orbital surfaces, recognizing that new e-shells may participate in conduction and bonding alone while others may rotate freely and separately contribute to magnetism.</p><p>Magnetic action is next explained as a natural extension of the aligned rotation of conducting electron surfaces in a current-carrying wire. Through the vertical transmission of rotational momentum between atoms through polar surface contact, a horizontal interaction is also introduced toward their equators. The magnetic field, B, of the atom describes this surface motion, which occurs 90 degrees orthogonal to current, I (see&nbsp;<strong>Fig 1A</strong>).</p><p>The reason that magnetic action extends beyond the current-carrying wire’s apparent surface is that while&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ccsf.edu/Departments/Chemistry/armstrong/chem_101a/h_orbitals.pdf"><span>99.999% of the electron exists within 430 pm of the nucleus</span></a>, there is a small chance of finding that surface extended to incredible distances.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, under Quantum Mechanics,&nbsp;<a href="https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Book%3A_An_Introduction_to_the_Electronic_Structure_of_Atoms_and_Molecules_(Bader)/3%3A_The_Hydrogen_Atom/3.3%3A_The_Probability_Distribution_of_the_Hydrogen_Atom"><span>the radial distribution function</span></a>&nbsp;for the electron has no limit on reach.&nbsp;&nbsp;For our model, we represent this unusual quality of the atom as rarefied extensions of the electron shell:&nbsp;&nbsp;incredibly thin filaments, radially organized about the atom (<strong>Fig 1B)</strong>.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595356514575_50369"><p>We imagine the physical extensions of the atomic surface are responsible for the action-at-a-distance. Lateral magnetic motion of conductive rotating e-shells thus synergizes between current-aligned wires, pulling them together as shown in&nbsp;<strong>Figure 2</strong>&nbsp;below (panels&nbsp;<strong>A&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>). This illustrates the basic principle of magnetic attraction. By inverting one of the wires, we find that currents are now opposed, as are the magnetic actions of each column’s atoms (<strong>Fig 2C</strong>). The clash of opposing effort between e-shells in each column drives the wires apart and illustrates magnetic repulsion.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595376469685_18181"><div><p>To construct the most basic magnet imaginable, we coil up our single-file hydrogen wire as shown in below in&nbsp;<strong>Figure 3</strong>. Coiling of the wire aligns the lateral motion of all e-shells on the surface of the composite cylinder (<strong>Fig 3B</strong>). The combined flow of the coil’s composite surface appears to track out from one end of the coil and into the other. The composite magnetic field describes this pole-to-pole flow of the coil’s atomic surfaces.</p><p>It is now easy to understand how the magnetic attraction between current-aligned wires multiplies through the coil’s architecture, since lateral efforts align and combine.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we bring the North pole of one coil near the South pole of another, the radial extensions of the e-shell enmesh laterally and pull the coils together magnetically (<strong>Fig 3C</strong>).&nbsp;&nbsp;Inverting one coil and pitting South vs. South or North vs. North poles has the opposite effect, where the conflicting effort of each coil’s atoms push them apart (<strong>Fig 3D</strong>).</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595376469685_54398"><div><p>Again, any visualization of intricate physical processes inherently necessitates simplification.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, we have utilized a single-atom-thick wire of ionized hydrogen for our demonstration and readily acknowledge this as a hypothetical object only. If such a wire exists naturally, its likeness is probably only found in the deep reaches of outer space. In our every-day reality, we only encounter synthetic electromagnets comprised of more complex atoms. This means those metals have additional surfaces. In common conducting materials, such as copper, there may be several polar contacts available for electromagnetic interaction.</p><p>Even more complex metals, like those found in a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet"><span>bar magnet</span></a>, appear to utilize separate orbitals for bonding and conduction than those involved in magnetism. We would visualize distinct magnetized e-shells as freely rotating, and spatially isolated from the conductive bonding lattice. This is why “permanently” magnetized materials do not exhibit a current. Furthermore, the relevant magnetic e-shell surfaces in bar magnets still retain the essential pattern of the spiraled coil from our depiction. We are working toward an animation of these complex atoms and will present an appropriate visualization in a future post/video.</p><p>One final note is that often the strongest magnet is a combination of a magnetizable metal with a coil. A magnetizable metal has unencumbered e-shells distinct from bonding and these surfaces are readily incited to magnetic cohesion through contact with coil’s extended atomic surfaces. Often, cores of electromagnets utilize iron or nickel for the very reason that these elements are highly&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_susceptibility"><span>susceptible</span></a>&nbsp;to the magnetic behaviors (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_moment"><span>moment</span></a>) of proximally excited atoms in the coil.&nbsp;&nbsp;By contributing aligned e-shells to lateral rotatory action, the iron/nickel atoms amplify the strength of the coil’s electromagnetism.</p></div></div></div>]]>

Several teams that&nbsp;ranked behind the Iroquois Nationals have been invited to compete in Alabama.</p>  <p>The Haudenosaunee —&nbsp;a confederacy of six First Nations: Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca and Tuscarora Nations — invented lacrosse and call it the&nbsp;Creator's Game.</p>  <p>The Iroquois Nationals are member in good standing of World Lacrosse. But it's the International World Games Association (IWGA) that determines eligibility for the Alabama tournament.</p>  <p>The IWGA has not responded to requests for comment. The organizing committee for the World Games in Birmingham&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aptnnews.ca/national-news/petition-calls-for-boycott-of-world-lacrosse-games-after-iroquois-nationals-excluded/">told APTN</a>&nbsp;that IWGA follows the&nbsp;criteria established by the International Olympics Committee, which states that "the expression country means an independent State recognized by the international community."</p>  <p>The Haudenosaunee Confederacy more than meets that definition, says Iroquois Nationals executive director Leo Nolan, a Mohawk from the Onondaga Nation. Here is part of his conversation with&nbsp;<em>As It Happens </em>guest host Susan Bonner.</p>  <p><strong>Take us through the moment you found out the Nationals were not invited to the World Games. What was your reaction?</strong></p>  <p>We found out through a third party in late September, early October.</p>  <p>We immediately sent a letter to World Lacrosse asking about our lack of inclusion. And the response back was that we didn't meet what they believed were — and this is their belief — that we wouldn't meet that criteria as a nation state to be included in the Olympics.</p>  <p>All of this is a precursor of the Olympics, which, you know, we're right now on provisional status, lacrosse as a sport. And once the provisional status is lifted, then hopefully lacrosse will be reintroduced to the Olympics in 2028 in Los Angeles.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.2707570.1595882465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/haudenosaunee-passport.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.2707570.1595882465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/haudenosaunee-passport.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.2707570.1595882465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/haudenosaunee-passport.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.2707570.1595882465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/haudenosaunee-passport.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.2707570.1595882465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/haudenosaunee-passport.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.2707570.1595882465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/haudenosaunee-passport.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>The Iroquois Nationals travel with Haudenosaunee passports — a fact that has led to travel delays in previous competitions. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Submitted by Candace Maracle)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p><strong>How does the team rank worldwide?</strong></p>  <p>In the men's ... we are third in the world.

I mean, I don't think that's the way we should operate in this time and age.</p>  <p>I think part of it could be a lack of appreciation, understanding and just basic knowledge about who&nbsp;we are as a nation state, so to speak.&nbsp;</p>  <p>There's always speculation about, you know, racism, and I think that it's wrong for us to even push that kind of thing. I don't have strong evidence of that aspect of it, and I don't think that that's the way we want to go forward with this. So I think it's more a lack of ...&nbsp;understanding our status.</p>    <blockquote><span><span><svg version="1.1" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" width="30px" height="25px" viewBox="0 0 52.157 39.117" enable-background="new 0 0 52.157 39.117" space="preserve"><g><g><path fill="000000" d="M22.692,10.113c-5.199,1.4-8.398,4.4-8.398,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.6,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.4,3.4,3.4,6.602   c0,3.799-3.4,6.799-7.4,6.799c-4.6,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z M45.692,10.113   c-5.199,1.4-8.399,4.4-8.399,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.601,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.399,3.4,3.399,6.602c0,3.799-3.399,6.799-7.399,6.799   c-4.601,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z"></path></g></g><g display="none"><g display="inline"> <path fill="000000" d="M6.648,29.759c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.399-3.4-3.399-6.6   c0-3.801,3.399-6.801,7.399-6.801c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z M29.648,29.759   c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.401-3.4-3.401-6.6c0-3.801,3.401-6.801,7.401-6.801   c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z"></path></g></g></svg>We are the originators of the game.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div>
<p>As a nonprofit coding organization running physical events, a lot of what CodeDay does (in a normal year) requires sending things in the real-world. Broadly speaking, this includes event supplies to event teams, and swag/awards to community members and volunteers.</p>



<p>In our early days, I was shipping merch from my office, and every quarter I’d get together with a couple volunteers to assemble and ship out all the event supply boxes for the upcoming events. Eventually, this started to take up too much time.</p>



<p>This isn’t unique to organizations in STEM education, I had the same problem when I ran a startup. People love to represent the startups they use, so sending swag is a great way to market! I have fond memories from my last startup of walking around SoMa in the mornings, trying to find mail dropoffs that weren’t too full so I could stuff a some shirts in for our customers.</p>



<p>Today I’ll share our journey to a fully-automated swag distribution infrastructure. I believe this is something any startup could quickly replicate, so I hope this can save you time!</p>



<h2>First Attempt: Less Steps to Get Things Out the Door</h2>



<p>The first thing we tried was cutting out steps to get things out the door. There were two types of work I was doing: packaging, and labeling.</p>



<h3>Packaging</h3>



<p>90% of people who need swag are getting a single SKU: a t-shirt, a set of stickers, a thank-you letter, etc. So I + some volunteers started by just folding all the shirts and then packaging everything into individual envelopes.</p>



<p>Most of the time was spent on folding the shirts. We’ve recently switched to a printer that will just do this for us, <a href="https://www.gorillaprintshop.com/home">Gorilla Screen Printing in Seattle.</a> Super nice folks, and they will happily deliver individually bagged shirts with size stickers on request.</p>



<p>We kept a database of the final shipping weights of each type of packaged product.</p>



<h3>Labeling</h3>



<p>At this time, all our backend infrastructure was in PHP, so we started out by writing a PHP library to build shipping labels for UPS and USPS. Nowadays <a href="https://www.easypost.com/">Easypost </a>can do this for you, but as you’ll see soon, I don’t think this is the best route anymore.</p>



<p>The system worked like this: someone shared they were going to CodeDay on social media and then filled out a form with their address, the system generated a shipping label, and it was automatically printed with the Dymo LabelWriter API. Every morning I’d grab the printed labels, stick them on the corresponding items, and then take it to the mailbox.</p>



<p>(On the supplies side, our event management monolith, Clear, would automatically generate labels for event supplies once a quarter.)</p>



<p>A few months after we started using this library, I came across <a href="https://www.shipstation.com/">ShipStation, </a>which provides an easy API for entering shipments, and can batch-print shipment labels from a web UI. It was technically less automated than before, but it was nice to have a way to verify what was being shipped and manually add shipments, so we switched everything over.</p>



<p>This worked fine for a year or so, but eventually the volume increased a lot, and they closed the post office next to our office, so we started looking for a better solution.</p>



<h2>Second Attempt: Fully Automated Fulfillment</h2>



<p>To fully automate things, we started looking at 3rd-party logistics providers. These are companies that operate warehouses and employ workers to receive your items, stock them on a shelf, and then pick and ship them when you call an API.</p>



<p>We did some research into a few, which I included at the end, but most providers were focused on e-commerce or larger volumes. We ended out selecting <a href="https://www.shipbob.com/">ShipBob </a>because they had the most sensible pricing for this application.</p>



<p>Speaking of pricing, here’s how it works with ShipBob:</p>



<ul><li>You pay a <strong>receiving fee</strong> for each shipment you send to one of their warehouses. This is on the order of $25 and is insignificant if you’re restocking once or twice a year.</li><li>You pay a <strong>storage fee</strong> for each uniquely addressable item. This ranges from $5/mo – $40/mo depending on how much physical space they allocate to it. If you have 1 shirt in 2 colors and 5 sizes each, that’s 1*2*5=10 unique items. So consolidate your merch variations.</li><li>You pay a <strong>pick/pack</strong> fee for each item someone has to pack in a box… in theory. First several are free, and most orders are 1 or 2 items.</li><li>You pay <strong>shipping fees</strong> which are generally going to be less than what you’re paying now, unless you have a negotiated rate.</li></ul>



<p>All in all, our storage cost was about 1.5-2x what we were paying for a storage locker in Seattle, which feels reasonable to me. We were shipping enough that we had negotiated rates with UPS, so the shipping costs didn’t really change, but for most people that may offset some of the increase in storage.</p>



<p>And obviously this is probably saving a lot of money if you value your time highly.</p>



<h2>What About Print-on-Demand?</h2>



<p>If you’re going to ship a lot of swag, the pricing won’t work out, and the quality is also not amazing. (Not ideal for something you’re counting on people to wear for marketing.)</p>



<p>We’ve been trying Scalable Press for some of our really one-off items like a “CodeDay professional gamer” beanie we give out for our community gaming tournaments. The interface is really bad, but it can work for these use-cases.</p>



<h2>Where We Are Now</h2>



<p>CodeDay’s shipping infrastructure is now fully automated! For example, when a volunteer needs a new staff t-shirt, or some stickers for promotion, they just fill out a form, and a week later, it arrives in the mail. If we need to add something manually, we put it in ShipStation and it gets synced to ShipBob.</p>



<p>Every year, we order a year’s worth of supplies from our vendors and ship them to the warehouse. (Gorilla Screen Printing for shirts and hoodies, Zebra Prints for awards, Consolidated Label for holographic award stickers, Sticker Giant for other stickers, and GS-JJ for pins.)</p>



<p>We can go back to thinking about education! Everything is now magic!</p>

<hr>



<h2>Fulfillment Partner Options</h2>



<h3>Amazon FBA</h3>



<p>Pros:</p>



<ul><li>Best prices on picking and shipping fees.</li><li>Presumably low rate of picking errors (since I’ve never gotten the wrong Amazon product).</li><li>Wide geographic distribution.</li><li>Have CodeDay alums working for them. 🙂</li></ul>



<p>Cons:</p>



<ul><li>Complicated fee structure which is structured for e-commerce.</li><li>The “long-term storage fee.” Amazon wants high inventory turn-over, and fees increase substantially for items which are stored for more than a year.</li></ul>



<h3>Flexe</h3>



<p>Pros:</p>



<ul><li>Highly flexible.</li><li>Wide network of partner warehouse.</li><li>Have CodeDay alums working for them. 🙂</li></ul>



<p>Cons:</p>



<ul><li>Highly flexible. Shipping isn’t our core competency so we want an opinionated solution.</li><li>Focused on higher volume sellers.</li></ul>



<h3>ShipBob (Our Pick)</h3>



<p>Pros:</p>



<ul><li>Own a decent number of warehouses in key markets.</li><li>Not too flexible, there is a “right way” to do it.</li><li>Documentation and pricing is less tied to e-commerce than other providers.</li><li>Reasonable fee structure (pay for shelf/pallet space, picking, and shipping) which is theoretically predictable.</li></ul>



<p>Cons:</p>



<ul><li>Higher picking error rate for visually similar items like shirts, even when items are barcoded.</li><li>Don’t consistently handle sets.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-980">

<p>Let’s jump straight to the strange behavior: up until&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/mysqli.configuration.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PHP 7.2.16</a>&nbsp;it was possible by default to exfiltrate local files via the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/load-data.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MySQL LOCAL INFILE feature</a> through the connection to a malicious MySQL server. Considering that the previous PHP versions are still <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/pl-php" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the majority</a> in use, these exploits will remain useful for quite some time.</p>



<p>Like many other vulnerabilities, after reading about this&nbsp;<em>quite</em>-unknown attack technique (<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://w00tsec.blogspot.com/2018/04/abusing-mysql-local-infile-to-read.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1</a>,&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://russiansecurity.expert/2016/04/20/mysql-connect-file-read/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2</a>), I could not wait to find a vulnerable software where to practice such unusual dynamic. The chance finally arrived after a network penetration test where&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/smaury92" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@smaury</a>&nbsp;encountered&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.knowledgebase-script.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PHPKB</a>, a knowledge-base software written in PHP which he felt might be interesting to review, and that was my trigger.&nbsp;😏</p>



<p>After deploying it and having a look at the source code, I noticed that during the installation it was possible to test the database connection before actually starting to use it. After going back to review my <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://portswigger.net/burp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Burp</a> HTTP history, I discovered that the API endpoint wasn’t protected or removed after the configuration was completed, and hence it remained available for any unauthenticated user forever after. A PHPKB patch was released shortly after my report and <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MITRE</a> assigned it <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11579" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">CVE-2020-11579</a>.</p>



<p>Moving on to the exploitation technique, despite it being around for quite some time the malicious servers available weren’t neither really&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/allyshka/Rogue-MySql-Server/blob/master/rogue_mysql_server.py" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debug-friendly</a>&nbsp;nor&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://gist.github.com/bmaia/adc503231ffff19a77aaf0c7abd2e895" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">standalone</a>. That’s why I chose to invest some time to write one which met both those requirements — the result is available on&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/ShielderSec/CVE-2020-11579" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub</a>. The script can work in two main modes:&nbsp;<code>server-only</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>exploit</code>. The exploit mode just adds the HTTP GET request needed to trigger&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11579" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CVE-2020-11579</a>, while the server-only exposes the malicious MySQL instance and waits for connections. For example, we can now exfiltrate an arbitrary file from a vulnerable PHPKB host in just one command:</p>

<p>I have recently come into possession of a series of exquisite miniatures which I pray are worthy of your esteemed attention. While my employers are familiar with your <em>unusual tastes</em>, they also appreciate your desire for privacy- this showing was arranged with the utmost discretion, I assure you.</p>

<p>To the untrained eye, the pieces might <em>appear</em> remarkably similar. Each canvas is a digitally-reproduced composition measuring ten pixels in height and ten pixels in width, illuminated in a strikingly intense blue.</p>

<p>To an, ahem, <em>avid collector</em> such as yourself, it is no doubt obvious that each print possesses unique <em>qualia</em>, as expounded upon by the artist’s extensive footnotes. Please, take as long as you need…</p>

<figcaption>Becoming and Unbecoming. Macintosh Operating System 10.14.6, Preview.App 10.1</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In this piece, the artist used a carefully selected vintage of the <em>Macintosh</em> operating system. The desktop wallpaper color was customized to consist entirely of the desired blue, and then the <em>Preview</em> application was employed to take a screenshot and perform the necessary trimming. Tragically, <em>Preview</em> cannot save files in the <em>Graphics Interchange Format</em> (GIF).</p>

<p>The <em>ImageMagick</em> application was then used to convert it into a GIF file:</p>

<p>For this piece, the artist once again created a PPM image, this time using the <em>Vi, Improved</em> text editor, giving the source code a subtly crisper affect:</p>

<p>The <em>Fast Forward Moving Pictures Expert Group</em> application was then used to generate a GIF:</p>

<p>The artist composed this piece using the <em>Persistence of Vision Raytracer</em> language, composing the following script in the <em>Nano’s Another</em> text editor:</p>

<pre><code>background { rgb &lt;0, 0, 1&gt; }
</code></pre>

<p>The scene was then raytraced as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ povray +Iiv.pov +W10 +H10 +Oiv
</code></pre>

<p>As with <em>Preview</em> above, the <em>Persistence of Vision Raytracer</em> is intentionally designed not to support the creation of GIF files; output is a <em>Portable Network Graphics</em> file instead.</p>

<p>This image was composed by the <em>Macintosh Operating System X Mach-O Gnu’s Not Unix-based assembler</em>, a utility for the creation of binary files. The <em>Sublime</em> text editor was once again employed for its neutral tone:</p>

<pre><code>.ascii "GIF89a" # magic number
.short 10       # width
.short 10       # height
.byte  0xF0     # 2-entry global color table
.byte  0        # background color index
.byte  0        # 1:1 pixel aspect ratio

.byte  0x00     # color 0: blue
.byte  0x00
.byte  0xFF
.byte  0x00     # color 1: black
.byte  0x00
.byte  0x00

.ascii ","      # image descriptor
.long  0        # x/y offsets
.short 10       # width
.short 10       # height
.byte  0        # no local colortable
.byte  0        # minimum LZW code size
.byte  0        # end of frame

.ascii ";"      # finish
</code></pre>

<p>Curiously, the output of this assembler is prefaced with an entirely useless header, which must then be trimmed. (Hopefully future revisions of the tool will correct this obvious usability gaffe!) The composition was thus carried out as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ as v.s -o assembled.o
$ dd bs=1 skip=208 if=assembled.o of=v.gif
</code></pre>

<p>Here, the artist employed the <em>Interactive K Environment</em> (iKe), a tool based around the unfathomably esoteric programming language <em>K</em>. The tool can be used to save animated GIF images of program output; in this case, a single frame as indicated by <code>fc:1</code>. Note that <em>iKe</em> automatically doubles the size of pixels within images when rendering.</p>

<p>For this work, the artist composed an electronic mail message to a colleague as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Dear [REDACTED],
I pray this letter finds you well.

I am in grave need of your assistance. I require an opaque image file in the .GIF format,
measuring precisely 10 pixels square, consisting entirely of the hexadecimal RGB color #0000FF.
If you could provide me with such a file as an attachment, I would be immensely grateful.

Warmest Regards,
[REDACTED]

(P.S. This will make more sense later.)
</code></pre>

<p>Some time later, the artist used their electronic mail client to save the final print.</p>

<!-- For the record, this GIF was created in the Windows version of Krita 4.30. Thanks, Michal! -->

<p>Here, the artist constructed a virtual machine- a sort of computing matryoshka, if you will- running the <em>Ubuntu</em> distribution of the <em>Linux</em> operating system. They then proceeded to install the <em>GIMP</em> application. Despite frequent threats by the developers to remove them, the <em>GIMP</em> application had (at time of composition) some obscure and infrequently-used features permitting the creation and manipulation of image files. After its painstaking creation, the file was then transferred between the virtual machine and its host by way of a physical Universal Serial Bus mass-storage device. The mass-storage device was prepared in advance by formatting it with the 32-bit <em>File Allocation Table</em> filesystem and labeling it <em>Charon</em>, in recognition of its role in transporting the soul of the artwork between worlds.</p>

<p>The artist generated this work using the <em>Gnu’s Not Unix Plotter</em>, based on the following description:</p>

<pre><code>set terminal gif size 10,10
set output 'ix.gif'
set margins 0,0,0,0
unset key
unset tics
unset border
unset label
set style rectangle fs border lc rgb 'blue'
set object 1 rectangle from screen 0,0 to screen 1,1 fillcolor rgb 'blue' behind
plot 1 lt rgb 'blue'
</code></pre>

<p>Note in particular how easily a user of the <em>Gnu’s Not Unix Plotter</em> may customize the background color of a plot. The plot description may then be rendered as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ gnuplot ix.gp 
</code></pre>

DNS-over-HTTPS</span></h2><p><span>As the need for DNS encryption evolves, there seems to be a growing debate between DNS-over-TLS (DoT) and DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH).

DNS-over-HTTPS isn’t used by Firefox and Google because it’s </span><i><span>superior</span></i><span> to DoT. It’s used because browsers operate at the HTTPS layer by default, so DNS-over-TLS doesn’t make sense (as things stand now) for a browser to implement.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Google can’t use DNS-over-TLS in their browser because they can’t modify the code on Windows or MacOS operating systems (which only support DoT at the moment)&nbsp; in order to encrypt DNS requests done outside of the browser. And that works for Google and Firefox, because they only need to encrypt DNS requests </span><i><span>inside</span></i><span> of their browsers.</span></p><p><span>Meanwhile at DNSFilter, we need to operate DNS encryption not just in the browser, but at the operating system level. That’s why we use DNS-over-TLS: Because it can be enabled at a </span><i><span>lower</span></i><span> layer and protect DNS requests outside of the browser (e.g. Slack messages, links embedded in Excel, or miscellaneous desktop applications). And right now, DoT is the primary way to enable standardized DNS encryption at the operating system level.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Note that DoH is being enabled at the OS level for new versions of iOS, MacOS, and Windows. Because Android is a Google product, and Google Chrome uses DoH, Android devices are already using DoH at the operating system level.</span></p><h2><span>Which is better?</span></h2><p><span>DoH is on everyone’s minds because it’s what Google uses, but it’s not necessarily </span><i><span>better</span></i><span> than DoT. It’s just </span><i><span>different</span></i><span>, and in some ways it’s actually inferior to DoT.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In a lot of ways, DoT is more efficient because of which layer within the TCP/IP model it is enabled in. Remember, DoH is </span><b>two</b><span> layers removed from the internet layer while DoT is only </span><b>one</b><span> layer removed.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Because there is another layer of encapsulation in DoH, it results in:</span></p><ul><li><span>More coding required</span></li><li><span>More libraries required</span></li><li><span>Packet sizes are larger than DoT</span></li><li><span>Ever-so-slightly higher latency</span></li></ul><p><span>These are a few of the reasons why DNSFilter chose DoT over DoH. Basically, we would have needed to send more data across another layer. Though it should be noted that both DoT </span><i><span>and</span></i><span> DoH increase latency, DoT has lower latency because of where it’s enabled.</span></p><p><span>But the most important reason for us, and our users, in choosing DoT was the ability to enable DNS encryption at the </span><i><span>lowest possible layer</span></i><span> since our users do not just send DNS requests over their browsers. That’s why we use DoT.</span></p><p><span>But that doesn’t mean we think DoT is the </span><i><span>only</span></i><span> answer. We </span><i><span>are</span></i><span> planning on having a DoH implementation for clients who need it.</span></p><p><span>As an example, Android devices, such as Chromebooks, use DoH. This is because Android devices were created by Google. While Windows and MacOS do not currently support DoH, Google was able to modify their Android devices so that DoH would be possible.</span></p><p><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-is-adding-dns-over-https-doh-to-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Microsoft has even announced adding support for DoH</span></a><span>, while also keeping their DoT support.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Though, just because Microsoft supports DoH for their operating system doesn’t mean the higher latency or additional coding requirements go away. No matter what, DoH is still implemented at a higher layer than DoT. The only change would be that now DoH can be implemented at the operating system level.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This addition of DoH support is likely less about Microsoft giving their users more options and more about them following Google’s lead.</span></p><h2><span>Other DNS protocol variations</span></h2><p><span>DoH and DoT are not the only encryption protocols available, though at this point they are more robust and the most widely used. But before encryption standards were available, there was also DNSSEC.</span></p><p><span>DNSSEC was an early DNS standard that provided </span><i><span>no</span></i><span> encryption or privacy for your DNS requests. It </span><i><span>only</span></i><span> prevents man-in-the-middle attacks. And if it is not applied properly, it will </span><i><span>break</span></i><span> your website. </span><a href="https://ianix.com/pub/dnssec-outages.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>You can check out a feed of websites broken by improper DNSSEC implementations here</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>DNSSEC is prone to frequent outages and it was never widely adopted. Due to that, and because it only does a portion of what DoH and DoT do, are just a few reasons that at DNSFilter we don’t recommend using DNSSEC, though we do support it.</span></p><p><span>DNSCrypt is another DNS encryption option, though far less popular than the two protocols we’re comparing right now. Like DNS-over-TLS, it is applied at the transport layer. DNSCrypt prevents localized man-in-the-middle attacks and encrypts DNS traffic between the user and recursive DNS servers, though it does not provide end-to-end encryption.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But the biggest difference between DNSCrypt and other standards (like DoT) is that there is no </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>RFC</span></a><span> (Request for Comments) like there is for DoH or DoT. This means it hasn’t been peer-reviewed and battle-tested. Implementations can vary greatly, and all of the definitions and specifications for DNSCrypt come from a single source.</span></p><p><span>You can access the RFCs for </span><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7858" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>DoT</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8484" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>DoH</span></a><span> here.</span></p><h2><span>DNS encryption is </span><em><span>still</span></em><span> evolving</span></h2><p><span>There is no right answer when it comes to DoT or DoH, because these standards support varying use cases. But if DoH continues to be adopted like it has been, we might see DoT go by the wayside.</span></p><p><span>With that being said, it’s not just a matter of choosing DoT or DoH. There is still work that needs to be done in both DNS encryption </span><i><span>and</span></i><span> SNI (Server Name Indication) encryption.</span></p><p><span>SNI is the layer above TLS and an extension of the TLS layer. Once you make a DNS request and TLS makes a secure connection with that IP address, SNI tells the server in clear text (not encrypted) what the name of that domain is. While this does not impact things like man-in-the-middle attacks, it </span><i><span>does</span></i><span> impact privacy.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This blog post is my attempt to give an overview of the sub-field of machine learning interpretability. I do not intend for this post to be necessarily comprehensive, but my goal is to review conceptual frameworks, existing research, and future directions.</p>
<h2>What Are Existing Overviews?</h2>
<p>Most of these ideas are based heavily off of Zach Lipton's <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03490.pdf">Mythos of Model Interpretability</a>, which I think is the best paper for understanding the different definitions of interpretability. For a deeper dive into specific techniques, I recommend <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.01933.pdf">A Survey Of Methods For Explaining Black Box Models</a> which covers a wide variety of approaches for many different ML well as model-agnostic approaches. For neural nets specifically, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14545.pdf">Explainable Deep Learning: A Field Guide for the Uninitiated</a> provides an in-depth read. For other conceptual surveys of the field, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/44/22071">Definitions, methods, and applications in interpretable machine learning</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08883.pdf">Explainable Machine Learning for Scientific Insights and Discoveries</a>. The Explainable Machine Learning paper in particular is quite nice because it gives a hierarchy of increasingly more interpretable models across several domains and use cases.</p>
<p>(Shout-out to <a href="https://www.connectedpapers.com/main/d516daff247f7157fccde6649ace91d969cd1973/The-Mythos-of-Model-Interpretability/">Connected Papers</a> which made navigating the paper landscape for interpretability very bearable.)</p>
<p>As always, you can find code used to generate the images <a href="https://github.com/owenshen24/interp-exp">here</a> on GitHub.</p>
<p>In the rest of this post, we'll go over many ways to formalize what "interpretability" means. Broadly, interpretability focuses on the <em>how</em>. It's focused on getting some notion of an explanation for the decisions made by our models. Below, each section is operationalized by a concrete question we can ask of our ML model using a specific definition of interpretability. Before that, though, if you're new to all this, I'll explain briefly about why we might care about interpretability at all.</p>
<h2>Why Care About Interpretability?</h2>
<p>Firstly, interpretability in ML is useful because it can aid in trust. As humans, we may be reluctant to rely on ML models for certain critical tasks , e.g. medical diagnosis, unless we know "how they work". There's often a fear of unknown unknowns when trusting in something opaque, which we see when people confront new technology. Approaches to interpretability which focus on transparency could help mitigate some of these fears.</p>
<p>Secondly, safety. There is almost always some sort of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06565v1.pdf">shift in distributions</a> between model training and deployment. Failures to generalize or Goodhart's Law issues like <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/Specification-gaming-the-flip-side-of-AI-ingenuity">specification gaming</a> are still open problems that could lead to issues in the near future. Approaches to interpretability which explain the model's representations or which features are most relevant could help diagnose these issues earlier and provide more opportunities to intervene.</p>
<p>Thirdly, and perhaps most interestingly, contestability. As we delegate more decision-making to ML models, it becomes important for people to appeal these decisions made. Black-box models provide no such recourse because they don't decompose into anything that <em>can</em> be contested. This has already led to major criticism of proprietary recidivism predictors like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMPAS_(software)#Critiques_and_legal_rulings">COMPAS</a>. Approaches to interpretability which focus on decomposing the model into sub-models or explicate a chain of reasoning could help with such appeals.</p>

<p>Lipton's paper breaks interpretability down into two types, transparency and post-hoc.</p>
<h2>Transparency Interpretability</h2>
<p>These three questions are from Lipton's section on transparency as interpretability, where he features on properties of the model that are useful to understand and can be known before training begins.</p>
<h3>Can a human walk through the model's steps? (Simulatibility)</h3>
<p>This property is about whether or not a human could go through each step of the algorithm and have it make sense to them at each step. Linear models and decision trees are often cited as interpretable models using such justifications; the computation they require is simple, no fancy matrix operations or nonlinear transformations.</p>
<p>Linear models are also nice because the parameters themselves have a very direct mapping–they represent how important different input features are. For example, I trained a linear classifier on MNIST, and here are some of the weights, each of which correspond to a pixel value:</p>
<pre><code>0.00000000e+00,  0.00000000e+00,  3.90594519e-05,  7.10306823e-05,
0.00000000e+00,  0.00000000e+00,  0.00000000e+00, -1.47542413e-03,
-1.67811041e-04, -3.83280468e-02, -8.10846867e-02, -5.01943218e-02,
-2.90314621e-02, -2.65494116e-02, -8.29385683e-03,  0.00000000e+00,
0.00000000e+00,  1.67390785e-04,  3.92789141e-04,  0.00000000e+00,
0.00000000e+00,  0.00000000e+00,  0.00000000e+00,  0.00000000e+00
</code></pre>
<p>By themselves, these weights are hard to interpret. Even if we knew which pixels they corresponded to, it's difficult to try and pin down what a certain pixel even represents for large images. However, there is an easy trick to turn these weights into something interpretable. We simply reshape them into the same shape as our model and view it as an image, with the pixel color represented by the weight value.</p>
<p>Here are the weights for the model that looks for 0:</p>
<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/linear-0.png" alt="a picture of a grid with 0 highlighted"></p>
<p>And here are the weights for the model that looks for 3:</p>
<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/linear-3.png" alt="a picture of a grid with 3 highlighted"></p>
<p>In both cases, we can see that the blue regions, which represent positive weight, correspond to a configuration of pixels that look roughly like the digit being detected for. In the case of 0, we can see a distinct blank spot in the center of the image and a curve-like shape around it, whereas the curves of the 3 are also apparent.</p>
<p>However, Lipton points out that this desiderata can be less about the specific choice of model and more about the <em>size</em> of the model. A decision tree with a billion nodes, for example, may still be difficult to understand. Understanding is also about being able to hold most of the model in your mind, which is often about how the model is parameterized.</p>
<p>One approach towards achieving this for neural nets is <a href="http://www.shallowmind.co/jekyll/pixyll/2017/12/30/tree-regularization/">tree regularization</a> which adds a regularization term that corresponds (roughly) to the size of the decision tree that can approximate the net being trained. The hope here is to eventually output a shallow decision tree that performs comparably to a neural net. Another approach is <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00221.pdf">neural backed decision trees</a> which use another type of regularization to learn a hierarchy over class labels, which then get used to form a decision tree.</p>
<p>Of course, parameterization is not the whole story. There are methods like K-Nearest Neighbors which are parameterized by your entire dataset; this could be billions of points. Yet, there is a sense in which KNN is still interpretable despite its massive size. We can cleanly describe what the algorithm does, and we can even see "why" it made such a choice because the algorithm is so simple.</p>
<h3>Is the model interpretable at every step, or with regards to its sub-components? (Decomposability)</h3>
<p>Another desirable feature would be to understand what the model is doing at each step. For example, imagine a decision tree whose nodes correspond to easily identifiable factors like age or height. This can sometimes be difficult because model performance is very tightly coupled with the representations used. Raw features, e.g. RGB pixel values, are often not very interpretable by themselves, but interpretable features may not be the most informative for the model.</p>
<p>For example, I trained a decision tree for MNIST using the following interpretable features:</p>
<ol>
<li>The average brightness of the image - <code>avg_lumin</code></li>
<li>The average brightness of the image's outline (found using an edge detector) - <code>edge_prop</code></li>
<li>The number of corners found in the image's outline <code>num_corners</code></li>
<li>The width of the image - <code>max_width</code></li>
<li>The height of the image - <code>max_height</code></li>
</ol>
<p>It seems like there would be at least <em>some</em> useful information in these features; ones tend to have less area (so <code>avg_lumin</code> would be lower), eights might have more corners, etc. etc. Yet, the resulting decision tree of depth 3, shown below, however, only achieves 33% training accuracy. Going all the way to depth 10 only bumps it to around 50%.</p>
<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/interp_mnist_decision_tree.png" alt="a decision tree trained on MNIST with interpretable features"></p>
<p>If we look at the nodes, we can perhaps see what's going on. At the top, we can see that our model will predict a 1 if the width is less than 7.5 pixels, which makes sense as 1 is likely going to be the thinnest digit. Near the bottom, we see that the number of corners is being used to differentiate between 7 and 4. And 4s do have more visual corners than 7s. But this is very rough, and the overall performance is still not very good.</p>
<p>To compare this with raw features, I also trained a depth 3 decision tree using direct pixel values, i.e. a vector of 784 grayscale values. The resulting model, shown below, gets 50% train and test accuracy.</p>
<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/mnist_decision_tree.png" alt="a normal decision tree trained on MNIST"></p>
<p>Here, it's not clear at all why these pixel values were chosen to be the splitting points. And yet the resulting decision tree, for the same number of nodes, does much better. In this simple case, the performance vs interpretability trade-off in representation is quite apparent.</p>
<h3>Does the algorithm itself confer any guarantees? (Algorithmic Transparency)</h3>
<p>This asks if our learning algorithm has any properties which make it easy to understand. For example, we might know that the algorithm only outputs sparse models, or perhaps it always converges to a certain type of solution. In these cases, the resulting learned model can be more amenable to analysis. For example, the <a href="https://davidrosenberg.github.io/mlcourse/Labs/UniquenessOfSVM.pdf">Hard Margin SVM</a> is guaranteed to find a unique solution which maximizes the margin. In another vein, the <a href="https://owenshen24.github.io/perceptron/">perceptron</a> is guaranteed to find parameters (not necessarily unique ones, though) that achieve a training loss of 0 if the data are linearly separable.</p>
<p>When it comes to deep learning, I'm less familiar with these kinds of results. My rough understanding is that the equivalence class of models which achieve comparable training error can be quite large, even with regularization, which makes uniqueness results hard to come by.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier with KNN, it seems, aside from mechanical transparency, …</p></div></div>

It bears such a considerable weight in predictive analytics, not just in conveying trust to consumers of machine intelligence, but also in ensuring predictive models deliver genuine value, make unbiased predictions, and reflect the true state of the environment within which they live. When data ethics go wrong, it can go badly wrong, potentially bringing down an entire organisation, with substantial direct and indirect collateral damage, potentially even on national democracy and social cohesion - the Cambridge Analytica incident a case in point.</p><p>We all need to take it seriously.</p><p>In 2018 Data Language was privileged to have been accepted onto the Digital Catapult “<a href="https://www.digicatapult.org.uk/for-startups/acceleration-programmes/machine-intelligence-garage">Machine Intelligence Garage</a>” programme. As well as supporting us with a terrific programme including compute resource, strategic help and industry engagement, Digital Catapult also took Data Language through their ethics programme. This was like a cold-shower, really waking us up to depth and breadth of data ethics. A realisation that data ethics is not just about data (technically), but about the way you approach your entire business. </p><p>With all this in mind, we were motivated to develop a data ethics framework that we could use internally at Data Language to assess all our predictive analytics projects, and that could guide us practically during implementation. We call this framework BOTT.</p><h2 id="the-bott-framework">The BOTT Framework</h2><p>BOTT (all good frameworks need a memorable acronym) stands for Bias, Outcome, Target and Trust. Through these four pillars, it allows our data science team to examine, and assess a predictive analytics model within its local and external ecosystem for quality, bias, and accuracy, and ensure it meets high standards of data ethics.</p><figure><img src="https://images.datalanguage.com/2020/07/3a-withDL.jpg" alt="Data Language BOTT Data Ethics Framework" srcset="https://images.datalanguage.com/size/w600/2020/07/3a-withDL.jpg 600w, https://images.datalanguage.com/size/w1000/2020/07/3a-withDL.jpg 1000w, https://images.datalanguage.com/size/w1600/2020/07/3a-withDL.jpg 1600w, https://images.datalanguage.com/size/w2400/2020/07/3a-withDL.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="bias">Bias</h3><p>An analysis of potential bias that may be baked into the model during its life-cycle, either literally through data or code, or intangibly through for example, some conscious or subconscious human bias. We examine bias from the following perspectives :</p><p><em><strong>Training data bias</strong></em> - is the training data diverse enough and comprehensive enough to accurately reflect the environment of the predictive model. What potential biases might skew predictive results either for good or bad outcomes - is there any chance these biases might exist in the training data we have used.</p><p><em><strong>Algorithmic bias</strong></em><strong> </strong>- is the model algorithm, its mathematical basis, or code potentially biased?</p><p><em><strong>Real-time input data</strong></em><strong> </strong>- if real-time (predict time) input data is involved in making some prediction, what might these data biases be, and how can we prevent them from impacting outputs.</p><p><strong><em>Team bias</em></strong> - has or could conscious or unconscious bias of the model development team contribute to model bias, and have we mitigated against it. Often just an open and frank team discussion around bias (with respect to the project under consideration) is enough to flush out these sort of issues</p><p><strong><em>Political, environmental, and social bias</em> </strong>- similar to the team bias but looking at potential external factors through a similar lens - for both ideally the team needs to be very comfortable talking about potentially politically or socially sensitive topics in an open, friendly and non-defensive manner.</p><p><strong><em>Output sampling</em></strong> - essentially QA - have you done effective output sampling and for quality assurance - does the risk of bias in the predictive model call for independent third party reviews in QA workflows, etc</p><h3 id="outcome">Outcome</h3><p>An analysis and survey of the full range of possible outcomes of the model:</p><p><strong><em>Catalogue</em></strong> - construct a catalogue of the potential outcome scenarios</p><p><strong><em>Impact</em></strong> - What does success and failure of the model mean :</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>

<p>Most of the programming languages are open enough to allow programmers doing things multiple ways for the similar outcome. JavaScript is no way different. With JavaScript, we often find multiple ways of doing things for a similar outcome, and that's confusing at times.</p>
<p>Some of the usages are better than the other alternatives and thus, these are my favorites. I am going to list them here in this article. I am sure, you will find many of these in your list too.</p>
<h2 id="1-forget-string-concatenation-use-template-string-literal-">1. Forget string concatenation, use template string(literal)</h2>
<p>Concatenating strings together using the <code>+</code> operator to build a meaningful string is old school. Moreover, concatenating strings with dynamic values(or expressions) could lead to frustrations and bugs.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> name = <span>'Charlse'</span>;
<span>let</span> place = <span>'India'</span>;
<span>let</span> isPrime = bit =&gt; {
  <span>return</span> (bit === <span>'P'</span> ? <span>'Prime'</span> : <span>'Nom-Prime'</span>);
}


<span>let</span> messageConcat = <span>'Mr. '</span> + name + <span>' is from '</span> + place + <span>'. He is a'</span> + <span>' '</span> + isPrime(<span>'P'</span>) + <span>' member.'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Template literals(or Template strings) allow embedding expressions. It has got unique syntax where the string has to be enclosed by the backtick (``).  Template string can contain placeholders for dynamic values. These are marked by the dollar sign and curly braces (${expression}).</p>
<p>Here is an example demonstrating it,</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> name = <span>'Charlse'</span>;
<span>let</span> place = <span>'India'</span>;
<span>let</span> isPrime = bit =&gt; {
  <span>return</span> (bit === <span>'P'</span> ? <span>'Prime'</span> : <span>'Nom-Prime'</span>);
}


<span>let</span> messageTemplateStr = <span>`Mr. <span>${name}</span> is from <span>${place}</span>. He is a <span>${isPrime('P')}</span> member.`</span>
<span>console</span>.log(messageTemplateStr);
</code></pre>
<h2 id="2-isinteger">2. isInteger</h2>
<p>There is a much cleaner way to know if a value is an integer. The <code>Number</code> API of JavaScript provides a method called, <code>isInteger()</code> to serve this purpose. It is very useful and better to be aware.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> mynum = <span>123</span>;
<span>let</span> mynumStr = <span>"123"</span>;

<span>console</span>.log(<span>`<span>${mynum}</span> is a number?`</span>, <span>Number</span>.isInteger(mynum));
<span>console</span>.log(<span>`<span>${mynumStr}</span> is a number?`</span>, <span>Number</span>.isInteger(mynumStr));
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595930285107/RiLxixUxC.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="2.png"></p>
<h2 id="3-value-as-number">3. Value as Number</h2>
<p>Have you ever noticed, <code>event.target.value</code> always returns a string type value even when the input box is of type number?</p>
<p>Yes, see the example below. We have a simple text box of type number. It means it accepts only numbers as input. It has an event handler to handle the key-up events.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>input</span> <span>type</span>=<span>'number'</span> <span>onkeyup</span>=<span>"trackChange(event)"</span> /&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>In the event handler method we take out the value using <code>event.target.value</code>. But it returns a string type value. Now I will have additional headache to parse it to an integer. What if the input box accepts floating numbers(like, 16.56)? parseFloat() then? Ah, all sort of confusions and extra work!</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>trackChange</span>(<span>event</span>) </span>{
   <span>let</span> value = event.target.value;
   <span>console</span>.log(<span>`is <span>${value}</span> a number?`</span>, <span>Number</span>.isInteger(value));
}
</code></pre>
<p>Use <code>event.target.valueAsNumber</code> instead. It returns the value as number.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> valueAsNumber = event.target.valueAsNumber;
<span>console</span>.log(<span>`is <span>${value}</span> a number?`</span>, <span>Number</span>.isInteger(valueAsNumber));
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595935455526/Tv1sEFRxe.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="3.png"></p>
<h2 id="4-short-hand-with-and">4. Short hand with AND</h2>
<p>Lets consider a situation where we have a boolean value and a function.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> isPrime = <span>true</span>;
<span>const</span> startWatching = () =&gt; {
    <span>console</span>.log(<span>'Started Watching!'</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is too much code to check for the boolean condition and invoke the function,</p>
<pre><code><span>if</span> (isPrime) {
    startWatching();
}
</code></pre>
<p>How about using the short-hand using the AND(&amp;&amp;) operator? Yes, avoid <code>if</code> statement altogether. Cool, right?</p>
<pre><code>isPrime &amp;&amp; startWatching();
</code></pre>
<h2 id="5-default-value-with-or">5. Default value with OR</h2>
<p>If you ever like to set a default value for a variable, you can do it using the OR(||) operator easily.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> person = {name: <span>'Jack'</span>};
<span>let</span> age = person.age || <span>35</span>; 
<span>console</span>.log(<span>`Age of <span>${person.name}</span> is <span>${age}</span>`</span>);
</code></pre>
<h2 id="6-randoms">6. Randoms</h2>
<p>Generating random number or getting a random item from an array are very useful methods to keep handy. I have seen them appearing multiple times in many of my projects.</p>
<p>Get a random item from an array,</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> planets = [<span>'Mercury '</span>, <span>'Mars'</span>, <span>'Venus'</span>, <span>'Earth'</span>, <span>'Neptune'</span>, <span>'Uranus'</span>, <span>'Saturn'</span>, <span>'Jupiter'</span>];
<span>let</span> randomPlanet = planets[<span>Math</span>.floor(<span>Math</span>.random() * planets.length)];
<span>console</span>.log(<span>'Random Planet'</span>, randomPlanet);
</code></pre>
<p>Generate a random number from a range by specifying the min and max values,</p>
<pre><code> <span>let</span> getRandom = (min, max) =&gt; {
     <span>return</span> <span>Math</span>.round(<span>Math</span>.random() * (max - min) + min);
 }
 <span>console</span>.log(<span>'Get random'</span>, getRandom(<span>0</span>, <span>10</span>));
</code></pre>
<h2 id="7-function-default-params">7. Function default params</h2>
<p>In JavaScript, function arguments(or params) are like local variables to that function. You may or may not pass values for those while invoking the function. If you do not pass a value for a param, it will be <code>undefined</code> and may cause some unwanted side effects.</p>
<p>There is a simple way to pass a default value to the function parameters while defining them. Here is an example where we are passing the default value <code>Hello</code> to the parameter <code>message</code> of the <code>greetings</code> function.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> greetings = (name, message=<span>'Hello,'</span>) =&gt; {
    <span>return</span> <span>`<span>${message}</span> <span>${name}</span>`</span>;
}

<span>console</span>.log(greetings(<span>'Jack'</span>));
<span>console</span>.log(greetings(<span>'Jack'</span>, <span>'Hola!'</span>));
</code></pre>
<h2 id="8-required-function-params">8. Required Function Params</h2>
<p>Expanding on the default parameter technique, we can mark a parameter as mandatory. First define a function to throw an error with an error message,</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> isRequired = () =&gt; {
    <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>Error</span>(<span>'This is a mandatory parameter.'</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then assign the function as the default value for the required parameters. Remember, the default values are ignored when a value is passed for a parameter at the invocation time. But, the default value is considered if the parameter value is <code>undefined</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> greetings = (name=isRequired(), message=<span>'Hello,'</span>) =&gt; {
    <span>return</span> <span>`<span>${message}</span> <span>${name}</span>`</span>;
}
<span>console</span>.log(greetings());
</code></pre>
<p>In the above code, <code>name</code> will be undefined and that will try to set the default value for it which is the <code>isRequired()</code> function. It will throw an error as,</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595930079306/ossRyuA7X.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="8.png"></p>
<h2 id="9-comma-operator">9. Comma Operator</h2>
<p>I was surprised when I realized, comma(,) is a separate operator and never gone noticed. I have been using it so much in code but, never realized its true existence.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, the comma(,) operator is used for evaluating each of its operands from left to right and returns the value of the last operand.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> count = <span>1</span>;
<span>let</span> ret = (count++, count);
<span>console</span>.log(ret);
</code></pre>
<p>In the above example, the value of the variable <code>ret</code> will be, 2.  Similar way, the output of the following code will be logging the value 32 into the console.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> val = (<span>12</span>, <span>32</span>);
<span>console</span>.log(val);
</code></pre>
<p>Where do we use it? Any guesses? The most common usage of the comma(,) operator is to supply multiple parameters in a for loop.</p>
<pre><code><span>for</span> (<span>var</span> i = <span>0</span>, j = <span>50</span>; i &lt;= <span>50</span>; i++, j--)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="10-merging-multiple-objects">10.  Merging multiple objects</h2>
<p>You may have a need to merge two objects together and create a better informative object to work with. You can use the spread operator <code>...</code>(yes, three dots!).</p>
<p>Consider two objects, emp and job respectively,</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> emp = {
 <span>'id'</span>: <span>'E_01'</span>,
 <span>'name'</span>: <span>'Jack'</span>,
 <span>'age'</span>: <span>32</span>,
 <span>'addr'</span>: <span>'India'</span>
};

<span>let</span> job = {
 <span>'title'</span>: <span>'Software Dev'</span>,
  <span>'location'</span>: <span>'Paris'</span>
};
</code></pre>
<p>Merge them using the spread operator as,</p>
<pre><code> 
 <span>let</span> merged = {...emp, ...job};
 <span>console</span>.log(<span>'Spread merged'</span>, merged);
</code></pre>
<p>There is another way to perform this merge. Using <code>Object.assign()</code>. You can do it like,</p>
<pre><code> <span>console</span>.log(<span>'Object assign'</span>, <span>Object</span>.assign({}, emp, job));
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595930544621/2jCCxCSnz.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="10.png"></p>
<p>Note, both spread operator and the Object.assign perform a shallow merge. In a shallow merge, the properties of the first object are overwritten with the same property values of the second object.</p>
<p>For deep merge, please use something like, <code>_merge</code> of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://lodash.com/">lodash</a>.</p>
<h2 id="11-destructuring">11. Destructuring</h2>
<p>The technique of breaking down the array elements and object properties as variables called, <code>destructuring</code>.  Let us see it with few examples,</p>
<h3 id="array">Array</h3>
<p>Here we have an array of emojis,</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> emojis = [<span>'🔥'</span>, <span>'⏲️'</span>, <span>'🏆'</span>, <span>'🍉'</span>];
</code></pre>
<p>To destructure, we would use a syntax as follows,</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> [fire, clock, , watermelon] = emojis;
</code></pre>
<p>This is same as doing, <code>let fire = emojis[0];</code> but with lots more flexibility.
Have you noticed, I have just ignored the trophy emoji using an empty space in-between? So what will be the output of this?</p>
<pre><code><span>console</span>.log(fire, clock, watermelon);
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595931639636/TXaeEwgGq.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="11.png"></p>
<p>Let me also introduce something called <code>rest</code> operator here. If you want to destructure an array such that, you want to assign one or more items to variables and park rest of it into another array, you can do that using <code>...rest</code> as shown below.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> [fruit, ...rest] = emojis;
<span>console</span>.log(rest);
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595932001526/GdWuvDoP8.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="11.a.png"></p>
<h3 id="object">Object</h3>
<p>Like arrays we can also destructure objects. </p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> shape = {
  name: <span>'rect'</span>,
  sides: <span>4</span>,
  height: <span>300</span>,
  width: <span>500</span>
};
</code></pre>
<p>Destructuring such that, we get name, sides in couple of variables and rest are in another object.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> {name, sides, ...restObj} = shape;
<span>console</span>.log(name, sides);
<span>console</span>.log(restObj);
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595932176160/97vWj-QQl.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="11.b.png"></p>

<h2 id="12-swap-variables">12. Swap variables</h2>
<p>This must be super easy now using the concept of <code>destructuring</code> we learned just now.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> fire = <span>'🔥'</span>;
<span>let</span> fruit = <span>'🍉'</span>;

[fruit, fire] = [fire, fruit];
<span>console</span>.log(fire, fruit);
</code></pre>
<h2 id="13-isarray">13. isArray</h2>
<p>Another useful method for determining if an input is an Array or not.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> emojis = [<span>'🔥'</span>, <span>'⏲️'</span>, <span>'🏆'</span>, <span>'🍉'</span>];
<span>console</span>.log(<span>Array</span>.isArray(emojis));

<span>let</span> obj = {};
<span>console</span>.log(<span>Array</span>.isArray(obj));
</code></pre>
<h2 id="14-undefined-vs-null">14. undefined vs null</h2>
<p><code>undefined</code> is where a value is not defined for a variable but, the variable has been declared. </p>
<p><code>null</code> itself is an empty and non-existent value which must be assigned to a variable explicitly.</p>
<p><code>undefined</code> and <code>null</code> are not strictly equal,</p>
<pre><code><span>undefined</span> === <span>null</span> 
</code></pre>
<p>Read more about this topic <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5076944/what-is-the-difference-between-null-and-undefined-in-javascript">from here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="15-get-query-params">15. Get Query Params</h2>
<p><code>window.location</code> object has bunch of utility methods and properties. We can get information about protocol, host, port, domain etc from the browser urls using these properties and methods. </p>
<p>One of the properties that I found very useful is,</p>
<pre><code><span>window</span>.location.search
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>search</code> property returns the query string from the location url. Here is an example url: <code>https://tapasadhiary.com?project=js</code>. The <code>location.search</code> will return, <code>?project=js</code></p>
<p>We can use another useful interface called, <code>URLSearchParams</code> along with <code>location.search</code> to get the value of the query parameters.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> project = <span>new</span> URLSearchParams(location.search).get(<span>'project'</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>Output:
<code>js</code></p>

<p><strong>When we first</strong> <strong>conceived of Density six years ago</strong>, we just wanted to know if there was a line at our favorite coffee shop. We thought it was odd there was an API for inclement weather but there wasn't an API for how many people were in a space. We reasoned, if a solution didn't already exist â€” which surely it must â€” it shouldn't be more than a weekend project. How hard could it be to count people?</p>



<p>We were optimistic and wrong by about three years. As we tried to solve our own problem, we learned two important lessons. First, people are weird. They do things you wouldn't expect â€” they bump into each other, take phone calls, and they bring a lot of stuff with them: bags and boxes, bicycles and baskets, tv's and trash cans, chairs, carts, iPads, lunch, even other people sometimes. This makes counting them unfathomably complex. You can't fault commodity products for being bad at the analysis. People are just really weird.</p>



<p>Second, we learned we weren't alone. We met hundreds and now thousands of others trying to answer the same question â€” how many people used my office, bank, lounge, desk, space, floor, building, campusâ€¦ city. If only we knew, we could reduce waste and energy use, improve access and productivity, clean the spaces that need it and skip the ones that don't. If only we knew, we could A/B test physical space or even use less concrete! If only we knew how the world was used, we could measure how it works, identify its inefficiencies, and remake it.</p>



<p>Until recently, we had been helping hundreds of companies do just this â€” quantify how buildings were used so they could design them more effectively. Today, things have changed. We've been asked to help those same companies and hundreds more reopen their buildings and businesses safely. We're helping them avoid leases they don't need in order to prioritize payroll. We're working to keep meat processing plants, distribution centers, manufacturers, offices, universities, even an entire village in Ohio open and safe.</p>



<p>The built world was modernizing before the pandemic. It will continue to modernize well after it's over. In the meantime, we're proud to say we're not going anywhere and we're eager to help.</p>

breaking its own 'how it works' rules to do so. You could say that
this is the complete reverse of <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/UnixAnnoyance">robot logic</a>,
as seen yesterday in <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/PamPasswdErrorFail">trying to change your password on Linux</a>. Recently I realized that I'd run
into such a 'do what I mean even though it doesn't fit' UI in plain
ordinary microwaves, of all places.</p>

<p>Your typical microwave has a 0-9 digital pad for entering the cooking
time and its cook time is set in MM:SS. If you want one minute and
twenty seconds, you punch in '1 2 0' and the microwave displays '1:20'
and counts down from there. This is all perfectly logical and sensible,
and forms a clear model of how the microwave behaves.</p>

<p>So what happens if you enter '9 0'? The microwave doesn't reject
this as an error because you can't have 90 seconds in the seconds
portion of a minutes and seconds time (you can have at most 59).
Instead it breaks the model and gives you 90 seconds of cook time.
This creates some inconsistencies, of course; if you enter '9 9'
you get 99 seconds, but if you enter '1 0 0', you get 60 seconds
(because now it's 1:00 cook time). On at least some microwaves
this still works even if you enter more than two digits; '1 9 9'
is 199 seconds, not an error (or one minute plus 99 seconds).</p>

<p>This behavior was so natural and so obviously correct and what I meant
that I spent years not realizing there was anything unusual about
it. Only one day as I was keying in '9 0' yet again and congratulating
myself on pressing one less digit than '1 3 0' did I stop to ask myself
why it even worked. And the answer is that the microwave makers went out
of their way to figure out what this input should mean so that it should
match user expectations, and make it so.</p>

<p>(I suspect or at least hope that there were user studies by some early
microwave company on what people expected to happen when they keyed in
various number sequences that weren't proper MM:SS setups.)</p>

  <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>When running a production Kubernetes cluster, one of the most important (and burdensome) tasks is keeping everything up-to-date. Kubernetes itself cuts quarterly releases, which quickly fall out of support—if you fail to upgrade, you could be left open to security holes and buggy features. Fortunately, the quarterly cadence at least makes these releases predictable: you can even set a reminder to go through the process every three months.</p>

<p>But on top of Kubernetes, you probably have half a dozen add-ons running in your cluster, most likely installed&nbsp;<a href="https://helm.sh/"> <span>via Helm</span></a>. Supplementary components like nginx-ingress, cert-manager and linkerd are often critical to running a production-grade cluster. You might even be using k8s-specific deployments for common applications like PostgreSQL or Wordpress. Each of these tools has its own release cadence, and some updates may come with critical security patches.</p>
<p>Installing a new patch typically isn’t that hard - usually it just means rerunning a <span><code>helm install,</code></span>&nbsp;command, or updating a single line in your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fairwinds.com/blog/why-infrastructure-as-code-kubernetes"> <span>Infrastructure-as-Code</span></a> repository. But how do you know <em>when</em> it’s time to update? Unlike Kubernetes itself, Helm chart updates are incredibly hard to monitor and predict.</p>
<h2><strong>Observe and Report</strong></h2>
<p><img src="https://www.fairwinds.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Nova_bfw_color.png?width=480&amp;name=Nova_bfw_color.png" alt="Nova_bfw_color" width="480" srcset="https://www.fairwinds.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Nova_bfw_color.png?width=240&amp;name=Nova_bfw_color.png 240w, https://www.fairwinds.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Nova_bfw_color.png?width=480&amp;name=Nova_bfw_color.png 480w, https://www.fairwinds.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Nova_bfw_color.png?width=720&amp;name=Nova_bfw_color.png 720w, https://www.fairwinds.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Nova_bfw_color.png?width=960&amp;name=Nova_bfw_color.png 960w, https://www.fairwinds.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Nova_bfw_color.png?width=1200&amp;name=Nova_bfw_color.png 1200w, https://www.fairwinds.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Nova_bfw_color.png?width=1440&amp;name=Nova_bfw_color.png 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px"></p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://github.com/FairwindsOps/Nova/"><span>Nova</span></a>, an open source tool by Fairwinds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nova is a command-line interface for cross-checking the Helm charts running in your cluster with the latest versions available. <a href="https://ctt.ac/8q0Af" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Click to Tweet</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nova is a command-line interface for cross-checking the Helm charts running in your cluster with the latest versions available. Nova will let you know if you’re running a chart that’s out-of-date or deprecated, so you can make sure you’re always aware of updates.</p>
<pre><code>Release Name      Installed    Latest     Old     Deprecated
cert-manager      v0.11.0      v0.15.2    true    false
insights-agent    0.21.1       0.21.1     false   false
grafana           2.1.3        3.1.1      true    false
metrics-server    2.8.8        2.11.1     true    false
nginx-ingress     1.25.0       1.40.3     true    false
</code></pre>
<p>This makes it easy to see how far behind you are on any installed Helm charts. In the example above, we’ve got the latest version of <span><code>insights-agent,</code></span>but there are minor updates available for some core infrastructure, including <span><code>cert-manager,</code><code>nginx-ingress,</code></span>and <span><code>metrics-server.</code></span><span><span><code>grafana</code></span></span>also has a new major version available, so we might be missing out on some cool new features!</p>
<h2><strong>Challenges</strong></h2>
<p>This turned out to be a harder problem than expected.</p>
<p>The first issue was in supporting both Helm 2 and Helm 3. Helm 2 stored chart metadata using ConfigMaps, which were fairly easy to parse. But Helm 3 uses Secrets, along with some byzantine encoding practices. With some help from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fairwinds.com/blog/kubernetes-easily-find-deprecated-api-versions-with-pluto"> <span>the Pluto team</span></a>, we built support for both versions, as well as the ability to auto-detect charts from both versions. You can use this feature by specifying <span><code>--helm-version=auto.</code></span></p>
<p>Even more challenging was matching the installed chart to the upstream source. Unfortunately, Helm doesn’t store info about the upstream repository in the chart metadata, making an exact match impossible. All we have to go on is the name, which might be duplicated across different repositories. For example, many of&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/bitnami/charts/"> <span>the Bitnami charts</span></a> were recently migrated out of the<a href="https://github.com/helm/charts/"> <span>core charts repo</span></a>, but kept the same names.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To find a match, we have to look in <em>all</em> known repositories for charts with a matching name, then use heuristics like the chart’s <span><code>version, home, description,</code></span> and <span><code>maintainers</code></span> to find a good match. So far this strategy has a 100% success rate, but it feels like a bit of a hack. If you know of a better solution for finding the upstream repository for an installed Helm chart, let us know!</p>
<h2><strong>Putting it into Practice</strong></h2>
<p>Nova saves a lot of time and effort for anyone looking to keep their charts up-to-date. Instead of having to monitor each individual chart for updates, operators can now run a single CLI to detect old versions running in their cluster. But you still have to remember to run the CLI!</p>
<p>When managing hundreds of clusters, the chances of forgetting to run Nova on a particular cluster, misreading the output, or failing to act on the results, are all but certain at scale. Furthermore, some organizations <em>need</em> to be on an older version of a given tool (in particular, <span><code>cert-manager</code></span> has regularly introduced breaking changes). So we needed a way to operationalize Nova at scale.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this is using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fairwinds.com/insights"> <span>Fairwinds Insights</span></a>. Insights can run Nova (along with other Kubernetes auditing tools) automatically on a regular schedule—every hour by default—and use the results to create&nbsp;<a href="https://insights.docs.fairwinds.com/features/action-items/"> <span>Action Items</span></a>. These Action Items serve as a reminder to update your Helm Chart, and can be piped to Slack, Datadog, or anywhere else your engineers live.</p>
<p>Internally, we also maintain a YAML file that includes a set of standards - particular versions of each add-on that we expect our clients to run. We use Nova to make sure that YAML file stays up-to-date with the latest versions, and to keep our Infrastructure-as-Code in line with those standards.</p>

<p>Automatically checking Helm charts for updates solves a big problem for us at Fairwinds, and for the Kubernetes community as a whole. But the ecosystem moves fast, and there are many more pieces of software and infrastructure that we need to stay on top of. Other things we’d like to build automated checks for are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supported k8s versions on managed Kubernetes providers (like GKE, EKS, and AKS)</li>
<li>Docker tags (at least where semver tagging practices are used)</li>
<li>Docker base images</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether these checks fit into Nova, or will justify creating a separate project, remains to be seen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any domain, staying on top of the latest releases is a big, scary problem. We hope Nova helps the Kubernetes community keep their clusters reliable and secure.</p>

But as more and more topics become too risky to discuss outside of the prevailing orthodoxies, it makes sense to constantly self-censor, feeling unbound only when part of a denunciatory pack. </p><p>Institutions that are supposed to be guardians of free expression—academia and journalism in particular—are becoming enforcers of conformity. Campuses have bureaucracies that routinely undermine free speech and due process. Now, these practices are breaching the ivy wall. They are coming to a high school or corporate HR office near you.</p><p>The cultural rules around hot button issues are ever-expanding. It’s as if a daily script went out describing what’s acceptable, and those who flub a line—or don’t even know a script exists—are rarely given the benefit of the doubt, no matter how benign their intent. Naturally, people are deciding the best course is to shut up. It makes sense to be part of the silenced majority when the price you pay for an errant tweet or remark can be the end of your livelihood. </p><p>Do these problems really matter so long as we have a president who daily tramples on rights, civil discourse, and the rule of law? They do. Of course, we must keep our focus on the danger this administration presents. But it is also our moral and strategic obligation to vigorously defend the principles of a free society. Upholding these values will help us defeat Trumpism. </p><p>The process by which sinners are punished and apostates expelled can seem random. But there are rules and patterns to the ways in which speech is being silenced. Analyzing and understanding these can help us stand up to the illiberalism of this moment, whether it comes from the left or the right. </p><p>To that end, here is my taxonomy of fear. </p><p><strong>The Perils of Safety </strong></p><p>James Bennet’s resignation from his position as the editorial page editor of the <em>New York Times</em> quickly became the genesis story of today’s debate about “cancel culture.” Bennet was pressured to depart after he ran an op-ed by Tom Cotton, a Republican Senator from Arkansas, whose argument that the military should be used to respond to riots caused an uproar among the paper’s staff.</p><p>At first, A. G. Sulzberger, the paper’s publisher, publicly expressed his support for the decision to run the op-ed. But that quickly changed after Black employees asserted not just that Cotton’s argument was morally repugnant, or that he failed to make it in a way that met the <em>Times</em>’ standards, but that the piece threatened their lives. “Running this puts Black @nytimes staff in danger,” many of them tweeted.</p><p>The language used by the <em>Times </em>staffers is indicative of a wider trend. In <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coddling-American-Mind-Intentions-Generation/dp/0735224897">The Coddling of the American Mind</a>,</em> Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt describe the recent emergence and rapid spread on college campuses of what they call “safetyism,” a view that “equates emotional discomfort with physical danger.” Safetyism, they write, teaches students “to see words as violence and interpret ideas and speakers as safe versus dangerous.”</p><p>Confronted with words, ideas, or decisions they dislike, a growing number of people are asserting that they are in danger of suffering psychological or even bodily harm. But when one party asserts that a debate threatens their very well-being, it is hard to deliberate on policy—or topics such as race and gender. The result is a narrowing of the space for public discussion and an inability to teach ever more ideas and books. </p><p>As Harvard Law professor Jeannie Suk Gersen has chronicled in the <em>New Yorker</em>, for example, law professors find it increasingly difficult to teach rape law because some students consider the subject too disturbing. “Student organizations representing women’s interests now routinely advise students that they should not feel pressured to attend or participate in class sessions that focus on the law of sexual violence, and which might therefore be traumatic,” she writes. “Some students have even suggested that rape law should not be taught because of its potential to cause distress.” </p><p>But, as Suk Gersen has pointed out, it was feminists who fought for the overhaul of deeply sexist rape laws, and it is sexual assault victims who will be hurt if lawyers do not learn about the subject. In practice, safetyism will make some of the most vulnerable people in our society less safe.</p><p><strong>Contamination by Association</strong></p><p>Recently, more than 150 writers and academics (including Yascha Mounk and I) signed a public letter defending open debate. Shortly after, transgender writer Emily VanDerWerff shared on Twitter a note of <a href="https://twitter.com/emilyvdw/status/1280580388495097856">complaint</a> she had written to her editors, stating that the letter had rendered her “less safe at <em>Vox</em>” because Matt Yglesias, one of <em>Vox’s</em> co-founders, was among its signatories.</p><p>How could signing a letter decrying the intolerant atmosphere on the left render a colleague less safe? Because, VanDerWerff argues, the letter was also signed by people she characterized as “prominent anti-trans voices.” Though the letter itself made no mention of trans issues, and VanDerWerff has never accused Yglesias himself of expressing objectionable views on the subject, this, she claims, was enough to harm her.</p><p>VanDerWerff’s note certainly illustrates safetyism. Going one step further, it also assumes the truth of a principle of “contamination by association.” People, the logic goes, cannot only be made unsafe by the beliefs or statements of their colleagues but also by those with whom their colleagues associate. </p><p>In this view, the contamination is ruthless and insidious. As VanDerWerff asserts, not only is Yglesias now responsible for the views of all the signers of the letter; she is also concerned that readers and sources may now assume that <em>she herself </em>shares those views because she works with Yglesias. If the principle of “contamination by association” were to be adopted this broadly, people would soon be answerable for the work of the co-signatories on a letter, for those with whom they have appeared on a panel, for those they might talk to on a podcast, and for countless others with whom they share the most tenuous of professional connections. </p><p><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/experts/shadi-hamid/">Shadi Hamid</a> is a Muslim scholar of Islamist movements; to do his work, he needs to talk to people who hold ideas many find objectionable. His willingness to engage with people he disagrees with often makes him the subject of fierce criticism about whom he “associates” with. He lucidly explains why the adoption of the idea that he shares responsibility for the views of others is so detrimental: “My policy is to speak with pretty much anyone—Islamists, Christian theocrats, Trumpists, Salafis—as long as I can say what I think on something that’s important to me.” </p><p>Even for Hamid, there are some red lines: He will not appear alongside white supremacists or those representing designated terror groups. But he insists that it is important to draw those lines as widely as possible: “If we said we couldn’t do research or couldn’t interview people who had bad views—how would we study things?” Hamid asked me. “It’s a very limited way of looking at the world, one that’s dangerous for democracy.”&nbsp;</p><p>Hamid is right. If we accept the logic of contamination by association, this requirement will quickly come to suppress the exchange of ideas—or even exposure to ideas which we need to interrogate precisely because we hate them. Tackling views we disagree with is a basic obligation of journalism, especially when they are held by people with the power to put them into effect.</p><p>David Remnick, the editor of the<em> New Yorker</em>, gave eloquent voice to the necessity of such interrogation when he explained why he wanted to interview former Donald Trump aide Steve Bannon at the <em>New Yorker</em> festival in 2018. Remnick acknowledged the point of view of those who assert that it is better not to give a platform to someone with illiberal views. “But to interview Bannon is not to endorse him,” Remnick wrote. “The point of an interview, a rigorous interview, particularly in a case like this, is to put pressure on the views of the person being questioned.” </p><p>But Remnick was not able to put this pressure on Bannon because the pressure on Remnick to rescind Bannon’s invitation was so great that he canceled the interview. </p><p>To accept the principles of contamination by association would also have another, perhaps even more serious cost: It would make it much more difficult to build a community across ideological divides—or within one’s own ideological group. Today, people are held to account for everything they have said or written, no matter how long ago, and no matter how much their minds may have changed. But under the rules of contamination, any affiliation with anyone else means everything <em>they </em>have said and done is your responsibility, too. Under such circumstances, any rational person is going to think of everyone else, first and foremost, as a potential human landmine; better, then, to draw the circle of one’s friends, colleagues, and collaborators as narrowly as possible.</p><p><strong>Intent Is Irrelevant</strong></p><p>Last month, Libby Schaaf, the white mayor of Oakland, California, announced that ropes had been found hanging from trees around a local lake. “These incidents will be investigated as a hate crime,” she said at a press conference. “I want to be clear, regardless of the intentions of whoever put those nooses in our public trees, in our sacred public space here in Oakland, intentions don’t matter.”</p><p>An investigation revealed that the five ropes had nothing to do with lynching: They were homemade exercise equipment, used by adults and children, put up months earlier by a black resident, Victor Sengbe. He explained his intent at a press conference: “It was really a fun addition to the park.” </p><p>But this happy conclusion was of no interest to Schaaf. The actual purpose of the ropes did not “remove nor excuse their …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><span><a href="https://www.srid.ca/b6df4059.html">Neuron</a></span></span> (<a href="https://github.com/srid/neuron" id="" title="">GitHub repo</a>) is a note-taking tool based on <a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/2011401.html" id="" title="">Zettelkasten</a>, that aims to be <a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/6f0f0bcc.html" id="" title="">future-proof</a>. Version <a href="https://github.com/srid/neuron/releases/tag/0.6.0.0" id="" title="">0.6</a> just got released; its major highlight is that neuron is now based on the <strong>Pandoc</strong> AST. This allows us to support any format supported by <a href="https://pandoc.org/" id="" title="">Pandoc</a>. Experimental <strong>org-mode</strong> support is <a href="https://github.com/srid/neuron/issues/313" id="" title="">already in</a>, to begin with.</p><h2 id="better-markdown">Better Markdown</h2><p>Previous versions of neuron used the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmark" id="" title="">mmark</a> parser which advertises itself as being “strict”. This prevented certain links from working as they caused the parser to fail. In version 0.6, I switched over to use <a href="https://github.com/jgm/commonmark-hs" id="" title="">commonmark-hs</a>, which is the Haskell implementation of the <a href="https://commonmark.org/" id="" title=""><strong>CommonMark</strong> specification</a>, written by the same author of Pandoc. Another reason for switching is that commonmark-hs and its extensions can be compiled to JavaScript via GHCJS<sup><a href="#fn1" name="fnref1">1</a></sup>, which is useful when reusing the Haskell code with the web app (see below).</p><p>The commonmark-hs parser includes <a href="https://github.com/jgm/commonmark-hs/tree/master/commonmark-extensions" id="" title="">a bunch of nifty <strong>extensions</strong></a> that are all made available in neuron.</p><p>In addition, you can style your Markdown notes using supported Semantic UI classes (<a href="https://github.com/srid/neuron/issues/176" id="" title="">see here</a>), as well as use raw HTML if necessary.</p><h2 id="uplink-tree">Uplink Tree</h2><p>I find arbitrary graph views of Zettelkasten software to be rarely useful. Neuron on the other hand displays what is known as a “<a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/5e41fd32.html" id="" title="">uplink tree</a>” in each note view, which represents the <em>subset</em> (inasmuch as “uplink” is a type of “backlink”) of the backlink graph for that note. In Zettelkasten-speak, we talk of a note “branching” to another. The uplink tree displays all notes “branching” to the note being viewed.</p><p>Uplink Trees are similar to navigation panel or category tree, except that the heterarchy is built organically over time based on how the notes are linked (see <a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/2017401.html" id="" title="">Folgezettel Heterarchy</a>). In the screenshot below, you are viewing the uplink tree of the note titled “<span><span data-inverted="" data-position="right center" data-tooltip="Tags: nix; reflex/obelisk"><a href="https://www.srid.ca/2017101.html">Type safe static assets</a></span></span>”. Notice how this note has multiple parents (that “branch of” to that note). See <a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/2011504.html" id="" title="">Linking</a> in the neuron manual.</p><p><img id="" src="https://www.srid.ca/static/uplinktree.png" title=""></p><h2 id="vim">Vim</h2><p>In addition to <a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/4a6b25f1.html" id="" title="">Emacs</a>, there is now a Vim extension for neuron. See <a href="https://github.com/ihsanturk/neuron.vim" id="" title="">neuron.vim</a> by ihsan. Just like the Emacs extension, it supports “virtual titles” in neovim, where the title of a linked note is displayed next to the link ID, as you can see from the screenshot below.</p><p><img id="" src="https://www.srid.ca/static/neuronvim.png" title=""></p><h2 id="improved-cli-query">Improved CLI query</h2><p>The <code id="">neuron query</code> command can be used to query your Zettelkasten and get JSON output. <code id="">neuron query --id &lt;ID&gt;</code> gets you the metadata of a zettel note, whereas <code id="">neuron query --graph</code> gets the entire graph. For an example of what you can do with the later, check out <a href="https://github.com/b0o/neuron-extras" id="" title="">neuron-autoindex</a> by Maddison Hellstrom.</p><h2 id="error-reporting">Error reporting</h2><p>Neuron 0.6 includes resilient error handling. If there is an error in your notes, the command line tool will report them both in the console and the web interface, without breaking its workflow. This enables you to leave the daemon (<code id="">neuron rib -ws ..</code>) running on your server, as all errors are now reported on the generated site.</p><h2 id="docker-images">Docker images</h2><p>While Nix is still the recommended way to install, we now also have auto-created Docker images for neuron. With one <code id="">docker run ...</code> command, you can run the latest development version of <code id="">neuron</code> in a matter of seconds. The whole image is only about 100MB in size. See <a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/c6176636.html" id="" title="">Docker workflow</a> for details.</p><h2 id="automatic-publishing">Automatic Publishing</h2><p>You can now set up your neuron notes to publish <em>automatically</em> on the web for free. See <a href="https://github.com/srid/neuron-template#readme" id="" title="">neuron-template</a> to get started. The gist of the idea is that we use GitHub Actions and Pages to update your published site as you change your notes in the Git repository. I publish every neuron site in this way. A <a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/778816d3.html" id="" title="">GitLab workflow</a> also exists.</p><p>You can also of course alternatively choose to self-host your neuron site, say as a systemd service. See the <a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/6479cd5e.html" id="" title="">documentation on this</a>.</p><h2 id="web--mobile-app">Web &amp; mobile app</h2><p><a href="http://www.cerveau.app/" id="" title="">Cerveau</a> (in private beta) is the web application on top of neuron that integrates with GitHub. The idea is that you can have your cake and eat it too. A command-line based workflow to edit your notes in Git repo does not mean you can’t do the same in a web application or a mobile app. Cerveau aims to address this gap, with the motto being: future-proof notes with little to no compromise on delightful user experience.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Not too long ago, a friend and new contributor to a large codebase I work with was surprised to learn that an automatic linter rule will block the merge of any pull request containing the string FIXME. “This rule is ill-considered”, he cried out, exasperated.</p>
<p>Judging from his reaction, I didn’t do a good job of explaining the rationale behind our rule. Our use of FIXMEs is unorthodox, but we decided to adopt it for a reason. In fact, in my opinion treating FIXMEs as merge blockers is among the most effective techniques for reducing cognitive overload. In this post, I will explain how FIXMEs unclutter the mind. My goal is to show that automatically enforced FIXMEs are an effective tool for teams working on hard problems.</p>

<p>Code comments are as old as programming itself. Codetags are also not a recent innovation. In the 1980s, programmers started attaching special significance to short tags like FIXME or TODO.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Tags were added as a heads-up that the author wasn’t entirely satisfied with a solution, both as a <em>note to self</em> and for the benefit of other readers. The use of uppercase letters not only made tags stand out visually, it also makes it easy to grep for them.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Codetags are in wide use today, though semantics vary from team to team. While often initially vague, over time more specific meanings tend to materialize, much like emojis in Slack communities gradually acquire a more definite meaning. In my team, a clear line separates FIXMEs from TODOs. The distinction between the two is not universal - it’s an arbitrary convention, but a very useful one. A TODO annotation means that the code in question could be optimized or cleaned up. Crucially, however, delaying the suggested improvement is acceptable, perhaps even preferable from a project-management perspective. A TODO is a gentle nudge. FIXMEs, on the other hand, signal that the code isn’t ready to merge until the author addresses the problem. Our automated linter adds reality to this stringent judgment: FIXMEs fail the CI build, while TODOs are given a pass.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Tags with an agreed-upon meaning aid communication between team members while the pull request is in progress. “FIXME or TODO?” you might ask your colleague while pairing, requesting clarification of the status and priority of a less-than-satisfying solution. Similarly, during code review a FIXME left in the code signals that the line annotated requires close attention. It’s a cry for help: “I’m stuck! Can we talk about this?”</p>
<p>While there are valid use cases for TODOs (more on that below), it is FIXMEs that are the more powerful of the two. In particular, FIXMEs have an important role to play before code is ready to review, which is the aspect I will focus on in this post. When encountering a stumbling block — a thought that will lead you away from your path — what you can do is to introduce a FIXME comment:</p>
<pre><code>// FIXME: hardcoded user-id

// FIXME: O(n2) time complexity, check if fast enough</code></pre>
<p>Some FIXMEs concern small detours, like retrieving a user-id from inside an existing function. Other issues are more substantial and will require serious thought to resolve. Either way fixing the issue demands mental bandwidth, which is in short supply. While it’s tempting to jump into the FIXME right away, the best choice is often to leave it to one side for the moment.</p>
<h2 id="two-examples-of-using-fixmes">Two examples of using FIXMEs</h2>
<p>Let’s look at two specific maneuvers made possible by FIXMEs. The first, <em>hardcoding</em>, is a form of wishful thinking. When the structure of the code makes it awkward to use a value, a refactoring safari is often needed. The maneuver is to delay this step. Wishful thinking begins with the what-if question. What if we had access to the id here? Well, let’s just pretend that we already do by hardcoding the value. This won’t work except in a very specific case, of course, so it’s not a generic solution — quite the opposite. But hardcoding an absurdly specific solution will allow you to make progress on the design while bracketing insignificant details. The generic solution will come later.</p>
<p><em>Stubbing</em>, the second maneuver, helps when multiple cases need to be considered. You start with a stub, replacing the missing case with an active FIXME:</p>
<pre><code>switch (v) {
   case 1:
   // do something
   break;
   case 2:
   // do something
   break;
   default:
   throw new Error("FIXME: Not implemented");
}</code></pre>
<p>With the partial implementation in place, can now experiment with and get a feel for the code. When you hit the missing case, it will fail loudly and clearly, with an exception and a stacktrace. But the FIXME is not only active at runtime. It will also ensure that you won’t forget to fill in the missing case before finishing your branch.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="juggling-concepts-and-virtual-memory">Juggling concepts and virtual memory</h2>
<p>Pausing a train of thought by converting it into a FIXME improves the flow of deep work, and we can see why by remembering that so many of us struggle to manage our daily priorities. As unfinished work piles up, we develop a nagging doubt in the back of our minds, a fear that there’s something important we’re forgetting, with all the bad consequences that entails. As a solution, David Allen’s Getting Things Done famously proposes a system of lists and weekly review sessions.<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Lists work because writing a task into a notebook permits you to forget about it temporarily. Keeping a written list of <em>IN</em> tasks helps you relax about your obligations, so that instead of incessantly worrying about things falling through the cracks, you can be confident that the task is stashed away in a secure place. You know you’ll return to the tasks in your review session, which has a pre-scheduled spot in your calendar.</p>
<p>Let’s apply this idea to coding. FIXMEs are powerful because programming is a cognitively demanding activity. There are limits to how many concepts we can grasp at any given time. In juggling, the number of balls an average person can keep in the air is three.<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> How many ideas can a person actively keep in their head at the same time? Perhaps more than three, but by most counts the number of ideas we can juggle is depressingly low. To switch metaphors, the programmer’s RAM or working memory is a scarce resource. Sure, there’s a spectrum here – some people can retain more data in memory than others. But if not careful, even the best programmer quickly runs out of heap.</p>
<p>We can push the analogy even further. Think of how effective pair programming is when working through a hard problem. The Linux virtual memory system allows the user to double their RAM by making use of spare hard drive capacity. Similarly, the pairing partner temporarily expands the programmer’s working memory by allowing them access to part of their cognitive capacity. Writing down FIXMEs achieves a similar effect. Whereas in a pairing session you extend your cognitive capacity with help from your partner, FIXMEs allow you to swap to disk. You remove an idea from your working memory, with the intention of paging it back in as needed, usually at the end of the session.<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="focus-on-the-inherent-complexity">Focus on the inherent complexity</h2>
<p>The net effect of temporarily transferring inessential questions to swap space is improved focus on the inherent complexity of the problem, the solution to which is the ultimate goal. Accidental complexity has a talismanic quality. We have an unfortunate but understandable tendency to get distracted by mere details of how to express an idea in code. It is true that eventually we will need a decision about the accidental aspects of the problem, but as a rule it is better to tackle the essential complexity first. The rest is FIXMEs.</p>
<p>Your brain is prone to worrying that you may after all forget about the hardcoded value left in the code or the quadratic complexity that might blow up in production. People will be angry at you, or, what may be worse, you’ll blame yourself. Whether we like it or not, emotions and other sub-conscious processes play a big role in our ability to focus. The unconscious mind will not allow itself to stop worrying about a task unless it is written down, with a system in place ensuring you will circle back to the topic without risking emotional backlash. Writing down FIXMEs has a liberating effect. With CI as a safety net, the brain can relax.</p>
<h2 id="three-ways-of-eliminating-fixmes">Three ways of eliminating FIXMEs</h2>
<p>After moving the distraction out of the way, you can focus on the core problem. When your RAM isn’t cluttered with inessential details, the clearer view gives you a better shot at seeing the solution. At some point, of course, you will need to go back to the problem you snoozed. Having reached this point, eliminating the FIXME can take one of three possible forms.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Perhaps surprisingly, you may be able to simply delete the FIXME at this point. Sometimes things fall into place. In the process of implementing the main logic, you often end up solving the incidental issue as a consequence of the approach chosen, perhaps without even realizing it. Additionally, addressing the essential complexity puts you in a better position to understand the original incidental problem. Equipped with this knowledge, you may realize there’s nothing left to fix. Perhaps in practice n is always 3, so O(n2) complexity is perfectly fine. Or you recognize that, with the confidence gained from completing an implementation, your worry was about something that wasn’t worth worrying about in the first place.</p></li>
<li><p>Another possible resolution is to face the problem head-on by performing the task you anticipated initially, for instance refactoring the code to get access to the user-id you needed or rewriting the algorithm to require O(n) iterations instead of O(n2). Frequently, a test case needs to be added as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally you can choose to downgrade the FIXME to TODO status. A TODO can remind you that the concern should be addressed at some point in the future. Often, filing a follow-up issue in your bug tracker will help make sure that the matter is not forgotten.<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Filing a follow-up is not always what we would prefer, but it’s a valuable tool, especially when …</p></li></ol></div></div></div></div>

<p>When starting on a new project or picking up work on this device for the first time, from that home location pull up a terminal (<code>Cmd+Shift+C</code>) and run <code>git clone</code>. This will create the new directory and fill it up with code.  If it’s a microservice situation, create a directory and clone all the various repos into that.</p>

<p>Other Visual Studio Code plugins can be used to make the development experience more enjoyable. Since it’s a new IDE for me, I only hae YAML, Golang, and GitLab so far.</p>

<p>Sadly, uploading images directly to GitLab is one-at-a-time so squashing commits is much more important.  It’s also hard to format images for the web.</p>
<h3 id="switching-gears-to-blog-post">Switching gears to blog post</h3>
<p>The go workflow is pretty slick. Not a lot of stuff missing with the basics.  I’m also trying to use this workflow for making the blog post you’re reading right now.  Drafting the text is nice and easy. The spell checker plugin makes it better than my standard <code>Sublime -&gt; MS Word</code> workflow.</p>
<p>The biggest deficiency is image formatting and organization.  The iPad is great for making diagrams but once the images are saved, getting them into a web-optimized format and loaded into the repository is a hassle. Especially because you can only upload one file at a time to GitLab’s “upload file” interface. I did realize the WebIDE can do multiple uploads, but only too late.</p>
<p>Once the files are in the repo, they’re gigantic PNG files which should be shrunk, cropped, and optimized for web display. I need to find some tool to plug this gap in my creative work.</p>

<p>After uploading the images, renaming them and adding references, it’s time to take a look at what was built.</p>

<p>Every change to the code is detected and the site is rebuilt. Since code-server saves the files every time you stop typing, it leads to a lot of rebuilds. The good news is that they take a dozen milliseconds each.</p>

<p>This review app URL in my configuration is tied to a DNS and internal IP address so it’s only accessible to me and others within my network or on a VPN. If you’re working on something public, exposing and sharing the review app may help with reviews and collaboration. It’s probably easier to just use <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/review_apps/">GitLab’s review apps</a> in that case though.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that using an 11-inch iPad Pro with the magic keyboard is a nice way to work comfortably anywhere. Even if the work is relatively intensive coding or authoring.</p>

<p>I will continue to use this workflow for a month or two and update about what enhancements come up or if I abandon it eventually.</p>
<p>The rest of this article is about how I arrived at this setup, what it took to get it configured, and how I plan on managing it.</p>
<h2 id="how-things-were">How things were</h2>
<p>For the past few years, I’ve been trying to find a lightweight way to get all the benefits of cloud and remote computing while having a comfortable and minimal developer experience. Small devices that were attempted in the past had too many compromises related to performance and feedback.</p>
<p>The prior evaluations have been erratic because it’s tough to tell which combination of physical devices and services can yield a favorable result. Here are some of the things I’ve tried that didn’t pan out.</p>
<p>All of the below are working from an iPad using various Apps:</p>
<ol>
<li>MacBook 11 inch air:  Screen was very low resolution, performance lacking</li>
<li>MacBook 12 inch:  At the time, I had a requirement for windows development and the devices (even i7) couldn’t seem to keep up with visual studio in debug mode plus a database</li>
<li>iPad GitLab’s built-in WebIDE: lack of terminals and listing and compilers, feedback loop through pipelines is too slow</li>
<li>iPad app <strong>Working Copy</strong> for git repos: great repo management and multi-file workflow, same lack of terminals and pipeline-based feedback</li>
<li>iPad app <strong>Screens</strong> with full MacOS on the tiny screen: native workflow so pretty good but exceptionally expensive and clipboard troubles make it frustrating</li>
<li>iPad app <strong>Prompt</strong> to use a Linux shell to do things: good for administrative but session time-outs and multi-file editing is poor experience</li>
</ol>
<p>I was recently convinced to try Visual Studio Code and noticed that it has a code-server hosted web editor option. <strong>Evaluation time!</strong></p>
<h2 id="setting-up-code-server">Setting up code-server</h2>
<p>The Visual Studio Code installation is a regular software installer on MacOS. Just install it. Super easy.</p>
<p>The code-server installation has some options like a simple web server that runs on the same Mac system. I consider this to be a copy of the <code>Screens</code> workflow so I’m not going to try this.</p>
<p>There is a code-server installation option that is to run as a container. This piqued my interest since containers are neat and flexible. This can be combined with the GitLab CI pipeline to build replacement custom containers to increase the built-in capabilities.  Linuxserver.io offers this with a templating/overlay mechanism to make some of the same enhancements I have done.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-kubernetes">Why not Kubernetes?</h2>
<p>In the interest of doing everything the hardest way imaginable, I took the code-server docker container and spun it up in my local Kubernetes cluster so I could benefit from the infrastructure.</p>
<ol>
<li>Ingress to a friendly domain name</li>
<li>Certificates issued from Lets Encrypt</li>
<li>Resilience and fail-over</li>
<li>Ephemeral filesystem as a scratchpad</li>
<li>Persistent storage for home directory</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="ingress">Ingress</h3>
<p>The main ingress configuration to access <code>code.p.terharlab.com</code> is set to connect to the code-server service.</p>
<p>I also added a Kubernetes service for 1313 and an Ingress mapping my internal load balancer to that service. Now I can pull up <code>hugo server --bind=0.0.0.0 --appendPort=false --baseURL={hugo ingress}</code> And it will attach to a service. I attached this Hugo port to an internal ingress rather than the public one to keep it walled off from the outside world.</p>
<h3 id="resilience-and-fail-over">Resilience and fail-over</h3>
<p>Since the storage is external to the pod, if the pod moves around, the storage will be re-attached. The kubelet scheduler will make sure a code-server keeps running and if it moves from one node to another, the ingress and services will reconfigure to get traffic to the right place.</p>
<h3 id="ephemeral-filesystem">Ephemeral filesystem</h3>
<p>When running the container, if you want to add something like golang or a different version of python, it’s easy enough. Just run <code>apt-get</code> or download binaries and put them in <code>/usr/local/bin</code>. If there is a problem with the tool, just restart the pod and it’ll go away since <code>/usr</code> and <code>/etc</code> are ephemeral.</p>
<p>I followed the enhancement process below to add <code>go</code>, <code>hugo</code>, <code>kubectl</code>, and <code>helm</code> to the image so I can build my lab-assistant application and post to my blog. This just requires updating the <code>Dockerfile</code> and restarting the pod to get the new container.</p>
<h3 id="persistent-storage">Persistent storage</h3>
<p>To be sure that the day-to-day configuration updates don’t get lost in the ether when the container restarts, the entire <code>/home/coder</code> directory is in the persistent volume. In my environment, this creates an iscsi volume and attaches it to the container to preserve:</p>
<ul>
<li>dotfiles</li>
<li>repositories</li>
<li>go (packages)</li>
<li><code>/home/coder/.local/share/code-server</code>
<ul>
<li>extensions</li>
<li>logs</li>
<li>config files</li>
<li>spell checker library</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I have started to be more conscious about privacy over the Internet, and one of the most important aspects to take care of when talking about privacy and security is where to store your passwords, as important as what passwords you use.</p>

<p>Most people (including me until some weeks ago) use the same password everywhere to easily remember it later.</p>

<p>Another common practice is to use iOS, Google or Firefox password tools, the problem with that is that you are forced into their ecosystem, and one should always think about who <a href="https://www.garron.blog/posts/your-passwords-online.html">let in charge of your keys</a></p>



<p>It is impossible to keep a lot of passwords in our memory, and writing them down is not a good idea either. I started to keep them in a text file encrypted with a password, but it was not the best solution.</p>

<p>So I started to use Chrome password manager, but I  did not want to install it on the iPad, even on the PC, I started using Firefox on the laptop too.</p>

<p>So I started to look for an independent password manager tool, but almost all of them required a paid account. And I wanted to have full control over my passwords. So, I decided to use Bitwarden, because there is a self-hosted option</p>

<h2 id="bitwarden">Bitwarden</h2>

<p>Bitwarden is an Open Source password manager tool, you can host in your server with Docker, this is maybe the most secure way to manage your passwords because you are in full control of them. Of course, they are on a server open to the Internet so they will never be completely secure.</p>

<h3 id="main-features">Main features</h3>

<h4 id="different-type-of-containers">Different type of containers</h4>

<p>Bitwarden is not only useful to manage your passwords, but it can also be used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Login Passwords</strong>: As all main tools, it records the url, the username, and password.</li>
  <li><strong>Credit Cards</strong>: Credit cards can also be stored on Bitwarden server</li>
  <li><strong>Identity</strong>: You can store all data of your identity, like Passport number, Social Security number, and so on.</li>
  <li><strong>Security Note</strong>: This feature I use a lot, they are like post-it, but secure post-it, I mainly use them to store the keys to unlock sites when 2FA fail, I keep the scratch codes in there.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="password-generator">Password Generator</h4>

<p>Of course, you can generate the password with the tool, and adjust the type of password you want.</p>

<p>You can generate passwords of different sizes, from 5 to 128 characters, and if the password will contain: Upper case, lower case, numbers, and special characters. You can also set the minimum quantity of numbers and special characters.</p>

<h4 id="export-and-import">Export and Import</h4>

<p>You can export and import the data, this must be done carefully, because it is exported a plain text document, and that document should be deleted once it is not needed anymore.</p>

<h4 id="reports">Reports</h4>

<p>Bitwarden offers different reports that help you a lot to keep your credentials secure</p>

<h5 id="exposed-password-report">Exposed Password Report</h5>

<p>This is one of the best features it has, it shows you all the passwords you use that has been exposed on the web because someplace you used them has been hacked.</p>

<p>Be sure the change all passwords that appear on this report.</p>

<h5 id="reused-password-report">Reused Password Report</h5>

<p>This is one is pretty self-explanatory, this report shows all sites where you have used the same password, try to change all of them to random passwords, if one site is compromised the hackers will not gain access to other sites where you use the same login and password.</p>

<h5 id="weak-password-report">Weak Password Report</h5>

<p>Here you can review all accounts that have weak passwords, usually the same where you have reused passwords. Keep all passwords randomly generated, and with long strings, no less than 14 characters.</p>

<h5 id="unsecured-sites-report">Unsecured Sites Report</h5>

<p>Here you will have listed all sites where you have an account that does not use SSL, in other words, the signing url is http and not https, on this sites you should of course use unique passwords, as it is easier to lose that password, and the hacker should not be able to use it in any other site.</p>

<h5 id="inactive-two-factor-authentication">Inactive two-factor authentication</h5>

<p>In this report, it will be listed all sites where 2FA is available, but you do not have it enabled, be sure to use 2FA on every site that has available. This way even if your password gets compromised, nobody will be able to access your info on that site.</p>

<h5 id="data-breach-report">Data Breach Report</h5>

<p>You can check here if your user name or email has been compromised in any data breach.</p>

<p>The report will show you what info has been made public together with your email address or login, the only thing you can do, is to change the passwords you used on those sites.</p>

<h4 id="two-step-login">Two-Step Login</h4>

<p>Your Bitwarden account can also be secured by enabling 2FA, you have these options to set it up:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Authenticator APP: Like the ones from Google, Microsoft or Authy.</li>
  <li>Yubico: You need to buy a hardware YubiKey to use this method.</li>
  <li>Duo.com: You need an account with them</li>
  <li>Fido:  This one is also from Yubico</li>
  <li>Email: You will get an email with the code every time you want to login</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="self-hosted-options">Self Hosted Options</h3>

<h4 id="official-apps">Official Apps</h4>

<p>You have good documentation on the site to host it on your server with Docker:</p>

<p>You will need to install at least <a href="https://github.com/bitwarden/server">the server</a> which you can use with your browser extension and your mobile app.</p>

<p>But there is another option for your personal use.</p>

<h4 id="bitwardenrs">Bitwarden_rs</h4>

<p>This one is the option for  persona use, it is small and also have all features the official one.</p>

<p>You can find the <a href="https://github.com/dani-garcia/bitwarden_rs">installation instructions here</a></p>

<p>But, here I will let you how I installed on my server.</p>

<pre><code>version: '3.3'
services:
  server:
    restart: always
    container_name: bitwarden
    volumes:
      - 'bw-data:/data/'
    ports:
      - '8888:80'
    image: 'bitwardenrs/server:latest'
    labels:
      - "docker-volume-backup.stop-during-backup=true"
  backup:
    image: futurice/docker-volume-backup:2.0.0
    environment:
      AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME: XXXXXXX      # S3 bucket which you own, and already exists
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: YYYYYYYYYYY # Read AWS secrets from environment (or a .env file)
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro # Allow use of the "stop-during-backup" feature
      - bw-data:/backup/bitwareden-backup:ro

volumes:
  bw-data:
</code></pre>

<p>With this configuration, you will have two containers, one with Bitwarden, and the second one that will take care to back up your database to AWS S3 or any compatible option. Remember that your vault is encrypted.</p>

<p>You will now only need Nginx or Caddy in front of it, I am using Caddy 2, with this configuration:</p>

<pre><code>bw.mysite.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:8888
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to use Nginx, you will need something like this:</p>

<pre><code> location /{
  proxy_pass https://your_local_host:8888;
  proxy_redirect off;
  proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
  proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Protocol $scheme;
  proxy_set_header X-Url-Scheme $scheme;
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Among with other server configurations.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Consider using a Password Manager tool, I recommend you Bitwarden, but you can use anyone you trust, I know that NextCloud comes with an add-on for it too, I think that is also a great option, what you should not do, is to re-use passwords, or use weak passwords.</p>

<p>Security on the Internet is as important as security in the real world, and you do not let your home or car keys anywhere, you keep them secure and with you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above, you'll find an interactive visualization that you can use to simulate regular expressions. &nbsp;You can type any regular expression and the tool will automatically create two diagrams that correspond to your regular expression. &nbsp;Both of these diagrams are interactive, zoomable and include support for a fullscreen mode.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first diagram is a parse tree. &nbsp;Constructing a parse tree is the first step that a regular expression engine will perform in order to decide what meaning each character will have.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can click on individual nodes in the parse tree to highlight the corresponding character in your regular expression. &nbsp;You can also go the other way and click on individual characters in the regular expression to quickly find the corresponding characters in the parse tree. &nbsp;By reviewing how the characters are grouped together in the parse tree, you can gain insights about the meanings of individual characters and how they relate to each other in the regular expression.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second diagram shows a control flow graph corresponding to your regular expression. &nbsp;This control flow graph illustrates the step by step process that is undertaken whenever your regex is matched against a piece of text. &nbsp; When attempting to match your regular expression, the process starts at the 'BEGIN' node and ends at either the 'MATCH' or 'FAILURE' node. &nbsp;Any path from the 'BEGIN' node to the 'MATCH' node corresponds to a piece of text that matches your regular expression.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the nodes in the control flow graph correspond directly to one or more characters in your regular expression. &nbsp;You can click on nodes in the control flow graph to see the corresponding nodes highlighted in your original regular expression and the parse tree. &nbsp;Also note that clicking on characters in your regex will also highlight any associated nodes in the control flow graph.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's difficult to truly understand how your regular expression works without seeing the decisions it makes when attempting to match a given piece of text. &nbsp;For this reason, every time you make changes to your regular expression, this visualization tool will automatically generate a piece of text that contains at least one match to your regular expression. &nbsp;If you want to review how the matching process work with your own customized piece of text, simply change the input value for the search string and the animation will update automatically.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of matching the regular expression starts at the 'BEGIN' node and continues by following the arrows to arrive at the nodes that actually do the work of the regular expression itself.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of writing this sentence, all regular expressions that this visualizer tool supports are ultimately transformed into an control flow graph that consists of the following 5 types of nodes:</p>

<ul>
<li>1) &nbsp;<strong>CHAR</strong>&nbsp;This node type checks for a specific character at the current position in the text that is being searched. &nbsp;If the character matches, we continue to the next node in the control flow graph. &nbsp;If it doesn't match, the control flow graph moves to the 'FAILURE' 'node'.</li>
<li>2) &nbsp;<strong>CLASS</strong>&nbsp;This node type checks for a class of characters at the current position in the text that is being searched. &nbsp;This node type effectively does the same thing as the first node type, except it allows for more than one possible character at the current position in the search text. &nbsp;If the current character in the text is among the list of acceptable characters specified by this node, we continue to the next node in the control flow graph. &nbsp;If it doesn't match, the control flow graph moves to the 'FAILURE' 'node'.</li>
<li>3) &nbsp;<strong>SPLIT</strong>&nbsp;This node type performs a 'split' operation. &nbsp;This is a situation where the regular expression matcher has a more than one possible path to continue through the control flow graph. &nbsp;In programming terms, this node effectively does the same thing as forking a process or splitting off work into two separate threads. &nbsp;This can also be implemented in a single thread by trying both paths one at time and pushing saved information onto a stack. &nbsp;In computer science theory, this node type should remind you of the difference between DFAs and NFAs.</li>
<li>4) &nbsp;<strong>ANCHOR</strong>&nbsp;This node type represents the commonly used 'beginning of string' or 'end of string' regular expression characters. &nbsp;This node is type is quite simple, as it simply checks whether the current position in the string is, respectively, at the first position, or the last position. &nbsp;If the check succeeds, we continue to the next node in the control flow graph. &nbsp;If it doesn't, the control flow graph moves to the 'FAILURE' 'node'.</li>
<li>5) &nbsp;<strong>PROGRESS</strong>&nbsp;This node type is necessary to avoid infinite loops in certain regular expressions that can include repetitions of possibly zero length strings. &nbsp;Without this node, there are cases where the control flow graph could potentially contain cycles that cause us to move around forever without making any progress. &nbsp;Each time a progress node is visited, it makes sure that we've made some progress in matching the regex since the last visit. &nbsp;If we have made progress, we move to the next node in the control flow graph. &nbsp;If not, the control flow graph moves to the 'FAILURE' 'node'.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may find it surprising, but most commonly used regular expressions can be described in terms of the above 5 simple node types.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary purpose of this visualization tool is help you understand the precise meaning of the characters in a regular expression. &nbsp;Therefore, this the tool will also cross-compile your regular expression into a hard-coded C program that implements a search for the regex pattern that you specified. &nbsp;Each of the nodes in the control flow graph has a direct correspondence to several lines of C source code that are expressed below the two diagrams. &nbsp;You can click on nodes in the control flow graph to see which lines of code correspond to the node that you've selected.</p>



<p><code><pre>current_character = safely_get_character(str, offset, pos, str_len);
<span>if</span>(matches_this_character(current_character, CHARACTER_TO_MATCH)){
  pos++;
}<span>else</span>{
  exit(<span>1</span>);
}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the implementation of a 'CHAR' node, we first use the 'safely_get_character' function to pick out the next character from the string being searched. &nbsp;The implementation of the 'safely_get_character' function is listed above in the 'Common C Code' section. &nbsp;This function is very simple since it just checks to make sure we're still within the bounds of the string that's being search, and if so, it returns character at the current position. &nbsp;If we're past the end of the string, we just directly exit the process. &nbsp;This corresponds to moving to the 'failure' node in the control flow graph.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After we've obtained the current character, we check to make sure that it matches the literal character that was specified in the regular expression using the 'matches_this_character' function. &nbsp;Here is the implementation of the matches_this_character function. &nbsp;As you can see, this function is very simple since it just checks to make sure that the current character in the string being searched is the same as the literal character that was supplied in the regex.</p>



<p><code><pre>current_character = safely_get_character(str, offset, pos, str_len);
<span>if</span>(matches_one_of_these_characters(current_character, NUM_CHARACTERS, CHARACTER_1, CHARACTER_2, CHARACTER_3, ..., CHARACTER_N)){
  pos++;
}<span>else</span>{
  exit(<span>1</span>);
}

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GraphQL started at Facebook back in 2012, it was developed internally before being released as open-source in 2015. In 2018 the project was moved to the newly created GraphQL Foundation, hosted by the Linux foundation. GraphQL creator Lee Byron has stated his aim is to make it ubiquitous across web platforms. Let’s look at how plausible that perspective is.</p>
<h2>A bit of theory</h2>
<p>GraphQL is a query language for APIs, its main advantage is allowing clients to define exactly what type of data is required. Developers create a schema that contains all the data clients can query through the service. This schema contains object types that determine the object you can request and the types it has. The schema is the basis all queries get checked against and then, after being validated, executed. Each field in the schema is attached to a function, called a resolver, which gets called to produce the values when a query is executed.

    </span></p>
<h2>A bit of practice</h2>
<p>Let’s check out how it actually works by looking at a simple example like a forum, blog or social media. In our example let’s say users have four properties: username, email, location and ID and can create posts with titles. Now if you need to create a profile component that only shows the username and ID, you don’t need the user’s email and location. With REST and other web service architectures, the API returns all user data and there’s no way to request specifically what you need without fetching unnecessary data. Doesn’t sound like a big problem? Just look at Facebook accounts and how many variables they have and you’ll easily get why they started developing GraphQL.</p>

    </span></a></p>
<p>GraphQL allows you to request exactly the parameters you want and the API responds with only the data you requested. It also does this via a single endpoint that handles all the client’s requests. That was just a basic query. One of the advantages of GraphQL is the ability to nest queries so it can be expanded to fetch a number of variables. </p>

<p>Let’s go back to the above-mentioned example of a blog/forum/social media API. What if your profile component needs to be a bit more complex? We’ll make a query that requests some basic user info as well as post titles for that particular user so that the profile provides a glimpse of the user’s activity as well as basic information.</p>
<h2>Why development teams are adopting GraphQL?</h2>
<p>One of the surveys directed to a variety of companies having experience with GraphQL asked their CTOs and lead developers why they decided to pivot to GraphQL. The survey identified six main benefits (<em>Development Velocity, Modularity, Scalability, Performance, Reliability, Security</em>) and asked responders how strongly they would agree/disagree with the following statements:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>We were able to speed up our development using GraphQL</em></li>
<li><em>We were able to scale our projects faster with GraphQL</em></li>
<li><em>It was easier to unify our APIs (e.g., Microservices, legacy endpoints, third-party services, etc.)</em></li>
<li><em>There has been an increase in performance using GraphQL</em></li>
<li><em>Our architecture is more stable, with decreased downtime, and fewer errors</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The results are:</p>

<thead>
<tr>
<th>Team size</th>
<th>What they wanted to achieve</th>
<th>What they’ve achived</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>50-100 &amp; 100+ devs</td>
<td>Faster development speed, better scalability, better modularity</td>
<td>Faster development, better scalability</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10-50 devs</td>
<td>Better modularity, higher performance</td>
<td>Faster development, better infrastructure</td>

<h2>Simple and flexible</h2>
<p>GraphQL not only straightforward, but it’s also extremely adaptable. GraphQL is client-driven and it’s creators emphasize they were focused on the needs of the client, not the server. That’s also why graphQL is so flexible so that it’s as easy as possible to use for clients.  You can use GraphQL with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python,</li>
<li>React </li>
<li>Java,</li>
<li>C++, </li>
<li>PHP, </li>
</ul>
<p>and a number of others as it’s meant to be a one size fits all solution that retrieves data regardless of the service, platform, or coding language. Can it become widely used across all platforms? Time will tell, but it certainly has all the tools for that.</p></div><p>The GraphQL Editor is a supportive tool for both advanced GraphQL users as well as those taking their first steps with GraphQL APIs. Our all-in-one development environment for GraphQL will help you build, manage &amp; deploy your GraphQL API much faster thanks to dozens of built-in micro features. Its graphical interface will also fix communication within your product team. Visualization is the key!</p></div>]]>

                    <p>After starting to use <a href="https://rolisz.ro/2019/12/30/cracking-the-human-memory/">spaced repetition more actively</a> and being <a href="https://rolisz.ro/2020/05/24/bullet-journaling/">more consistent with my journaling</a>, now I've tackled improving my note taking skills.</p><p>Over the last couple of months, I've read about various note-taking methods, different approaches and diverse goals for them and they helped me change my perspective on collecting ideas.</p><h2 id="my-previous-approaches-to-taking-notes">My previous approaches to taking notes</h2><p>While I was still in school, I didn't take too good notes. I guess the Romanian educational system is not set up to encourage that kind of critical thinking which leads to taking good notes. In most classes, the teacher would dictate a lesson, I would write that down and then memorize it, without needing to create my own summarized version of the lesson.</p><p>Then I took notes in Google Keep. When it came out, I was impressed by how simple and snappy it was, compared to Evernote for example. I've used it for around 6 years, so I have a lot of notes jotted down there. But Keep doesn't offer good ways to organize notes, having only tags and search. But to search, you have to remember something to look for, so it's almost impossible to find notes which you have forgotten.</p><p>As I've started moving my notes from Keep to Obsidian, I found a lot of old notes which I had totally forgotten about. Some of those notes were ideas I had, but I never followed up on them. Looking back they were good ideas: I know because in the meantime other people have implemented them.</p><h2 id="goals-of-a-note-taking-system">Goals of a note taking system</h2><p>A goal of a note taking system should be to store information, so that your brain can do more fun/useful stuff.</p><p>But another goal is to help you connect ideas, even from different domains. As you read things in books, blogs, or come up with ideas on your own, eventually some of them will be related and can be combined to make something even better. The note taking system should facilitate creating these connections.</p><p>It should also help you process your notes. A note is not a static thing. It's not something you just write down and then never touch again. Almost all ideas will eventually need refining. When you read a book and find something noteworthy, you write some notes, but in time you find that you can reword it better, as you understand things better. For your own ideas, in time you add something; you cut some things, hopefully making them better and then you create something with them.</p><p>Lastly, the note organizing system should help you organize and browse your notes. It should encourage serendipitous rediscovery of forgotten notes. It should help visualize them. It should make it easy to see all notes that are related to a certain note or to a certain topic.</p><figure><img src="https://rolisz.ro/content/images/2020/07/image-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-5.png 600w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-5.png 1000w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/image-5.png 1600w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/image-5.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Meta: Writing this post in Obsidian. Left: folder pane; middle: raw markdown; right: Rendered note</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> is a new desktop app for creating a "A second brain, for you, forever.". It's quite new, it was released publicly two months ago and it's not even at version 1.0, but development is progressing quite quickly, with a new version coming out almost weekly.</p><p>Obsidian is built around Markdown files, which means that the notes are portable and won't get stuck in an old program, should the company go out of business. It enhances the Markdown syntax with the some shortcuts for creating connections between pages using <code>[[name of other page]]</code> syntax. You can see for each page what other pages link back to it. There's also a way to embed one file (or part of a file) into another one. </p><figure><img src="https://rolisz.ro/content/images/2020/07/image-6.png" alt="" srcset="https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-6.png 600w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-6.png 1000w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/image-6.png 1600w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/image-6.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The graph view</figcaption></figure><p>One cool looking feature in Obsidian is the graph view, where you can visualize how your notes are connected. This leads to some interesting looking "constellations". </p><p>There are also plugins available. For now, the API is internal, so all the plugins are made by the same company, but they say that once they reach 1.0, they will make the API public. </p><p>Because Obsidian is based on Markdown files, you can store them wherever you want and you can sync them across devices with your favorite syncing tool. So far, I've used GitHub. </p><p>One disadvantage is that it doesn't have a mobile app so far (or a remote interface in general). On one hand, it's not a big issue for me, because my goals for notes require a big screen and a nice keyboard. In practice, I still like to have access to my notes even on the go, so I just use an Android Git client with a Markdown editor. Maybe one day I'll change this to expose my notes as a static website. </p><h2 id="my-note-taking-workflow">My note taking workflow</h2><p>My workflow is inspired by (but only inspired, not fully copied from) the <a href="https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125?gi=635ef2e210e3">Zettelkasten</a> method of Niklas Luhman, which is the trending note taking framework du jour, sprinkled with ideas from <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/basb">Tiago Forte</a> and others. When my note-taking workflow grows up, it wants to be like <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z3SjnvsB5aR2ddsycyXofbYR7fCxo7RmKW2be">Andy Matuschak's notes</a>. </p><p>I have a loose categorization of my notes into folders. I'm not very strict about them and I don't want to spend much time organizing a hierarchy. Some notes also have tags (simply words prefixed with # and Obsidian is smart enough to start a search for them if you click on one). </p><p>Many of my notes don't start their life in Obsidian, but in my bullet journal. When I hear something new, or I read something interesting, often my bullet journal is closer to me, so I jot down the main ideas there. Then, when I get to my computer and I have time I copy it into Obsidian and I flesh out the ideas fully. Then I try to find any other notes that are relevant and add connections to them. </p><p>One thing that I try to do is to make my notes my own. This means that if I read an interesting article, I don't just copy paste the interesting parts, but I actually reword them and write them down as I understood them. This helps both comprehension and retention. </p><p>For certain topics, I create index maps, where I list all the notes that I have related to that topic. So notes belong to multiple index maps, because they are relevant in different areas. </p><p>As I add new notes and create connections between them, I end up revisiting old notes and updating them. Sometimes it's with a negative update (it didn't pan out, it was a wrong idea), but sometimes it's a positive one (a further development or something similar someone else has done). </p><p>The most interesting part is when notes from very different areas start to "touch" each other. Because of the graph view, it's easy to see how close notes are to each other. I also use the graph view to see what notes are isolated and then I try to find them a place. As you can see in the above screenshot, I still have a lot of work to do. </p><p>So far I have added 160 notes in Obsidian, so it's a small knowledge base. I still have many notes in Google Keep to move over. But I feel like Obsidian has already helped me (I feel on top of my notes) and I hope something nice (and useful) will come out of it. </p><p>Top photo by <a href="https://nds.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian#/media/Bild:Obszidi%C3%A1n(Vezuv)005.jpg">Pogány Péter - Egen Wark</a>.</p><p><em>I’m publishing this as part of <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">100 Days To Offload</a> - Day 31.</em></p>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>As discussed in the <a href="https://leapfin.com/blog/an-accountants-guide-to-order-to-cash/">first post</a> in this series, Order to Cash describes the procedure for processing customer orders, applying payments to invoices, and matching payments to the cash received in a company’s bank account.</p>
<p>In this process, cash flows through a number of systems described in detail below.</p>
<p>Accountants perform cash reconciliations to ensure that cash has appropriately gone through these systems for each transaction.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="whatisaaidcashreconciliationcashreconciliationa">What Is a <a id="cashreconciliation">Cash Reconciliation</a>?</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>A cash reconciliation is the process of verifying the completeness of a sale or transaction across the company’s financial systems. Its completion provides assurance for both cash and revenue balances.</p>
<p>Multiple financial systems are involved in a cash reconciliation and generally, cash balances across these systems do not match.</p>
<p><img src="https://leapfin.com/blog/content/images/2020/05/cash-reconciliation-example.png" alt="cash-reconciliation-example"></p>
<p>We’ll explore cash reconciliations further below, but first we’d like to address a common misconception.</p>
<h5 id="cashreconciliationvsbankreconciliation">Cash Reconciliation vs. Bank Reconciliation</h5>
<p>Cash reconciliations are often misunderstood to be the same thing as bank reconciliations.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.accountingcoach.com/bank-reconciliation/explanation">bank reconciliation</a> is the process of matching transaction amounts reported in a bank statement with those recorded in the general ledger. Its purpose is to ensure that the cash balance recorded in the general ledger aligns with the entity’s actual cash balance in the company’s bank account. While companies and banks record the same transactions, the time at which a company records cash in the general ledger often differs from the time at which their bank reports the associated change.</p>
<br><!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="systemsinvolvedinacashreconciliation">Systems Involved in a Cash Reconciliation</h2>
<p>A cash reconciliation is more complex and comprehensive than a bank reconciliation because it involves a company's entire financial technology stack. Below are the four most common systems involved in a cash reconciliation. They can vary depending on company size, business model, or technological maturity.</p>
<h5 id="billingsystem">Billing System:</h5>
<p>A billing system creates and manages customer invoices that allow customers to pay for their purchases. Cash from billing systems represent how much cash is expected to be collected from sales.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Aria, Chargebee, Recurly</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="paymentprocessor">Payment Processor:</h5>
<p>A payment processor relays customers’ payment information to a company’s bank and the customers’ banks in order to complete a transaction. It verifies payment legitimacy and provides instructions to banks for fund transfers. Cash from payment processors represent the final cash received by the company’s bank.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Stripe, Adyen, Braintree/PayPal, WorldPay</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="companysbank">Company’s Bank:</h5>
<p>A company’s bank collects and deposits the cash from transactions that are successfully processed by payment processors. It is the final system involved in a cash reconciliation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="revenuerecognitionsystem">Revenue Recognition System:</h5>
<p>A revenue recognition system calculates revenue for the current period and liabilities for future deferred revenues. It ingests information from both billing systems and payment processors to perform these calculations according to the company’s arrangements and policies.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Leapfin, NetSuite ARM, Zuora RevPro</li>
</ul>
<br><!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Generally, the cash balances across these systems <em>do not match</em>, which is precisely why accounting teams need to perform cash reconciliations.</p>
<p>Common reasons for mismatch across these financial systems include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Currency differences (Transaction currency, local exchange currency, payout currency)</li>
<li>Foreign exchange translations (How an international company translates foreign subsidiary earnings into its reporting currency)</li>
<li>Timing differences (Deposits in transit, time zones, etc.)</li>
</ol>

<p>The simplest way to examine the relationship between cash, revenue, and deferred revenue is to understand the deferred revenue roll forward. A deferred revenue roll forward is a simple calculation that ensures incoming and outgoing activities to the deferred revenue balance are properly accounted for.</p>
<p><img src="https://leapfin.com/blog/content/images/2020/05/deferred-revenue-rollforward-1.png" alt="deferred-revenue-rollforward-1"></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>First, let’s review deferred revenue itself.</p>
<p>Deferred revenue is a cash payment from a customer for goods or services to be provided in the future. Since the seller’s obligation has not been filled, the cash has not been earned, and the seller records this as a liability on the Balance Sheet via a deferred revenue balance. Deferred revenue is especially common among subscription and SaaS companies, in which payments are made upfront in exchange for service periods in the future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: On Jan 1, 2020 a customer makes a $120 purchase for a subscription service spanning Jan 1, 2020 to Dec 31, 2020.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="generalledgerimpact">General Ledger Impact:</h5>
<table>
<tbody><tr><th>Month</th><th>Account</th><th>DR</th><th>CR</th></tr>
 <tr><td>Jan 1</td><td>Cash</td><td>$120</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Deferred Revenue</td><td></td><td>$120</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>As the seller completes its obligations over time to earn the revenue, the deferred revenue balance on the Balance Sheet is reduced accordingly by the amount of revenue earned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: The seller recognizes revenue monthly based on the service period of Jan 1, 2020 to Dec 31, 2020. $120 across 12 months results in revenue of $10 per month.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="generalledgerimpact">General Ledger Impact:</h5>
<table>
<tbody><tr><th>Month</th><th>Account</th><th>DR</th><th>CR</th></tr>
<tr><td>Jan 31</td><td>Deferred Revenue</td><td>$10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Revenue</td><td></td><td>$10</td></tr>
<tr><td>Feb 28</td><td>Deferred Revenue</td><td>$10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Revenue</td><td></td><td>$10</td></tr>
<tr><td>March 31</td><td>Deferred Revenue</td><td>$10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Revenue</td><td></td><td>$10</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>And so forth for April 30, May 31, etc...</p>
<p>At month 12 on Dec 31, 2020, the deferred revenue balance will be fully exhausted as the $120 cash payment would be fully recognized.</p>
<p>Check out our previous blog post on <a href="https://leapfin.com/blog/revenue-cash-reconciliation-for-subscription-businesses/">Revenue Cash Accounting for Subscription Businesses</a> for more detailed journal entries.</p>
<br><!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="cashisimportanttodeferredrevenue">Cash is Important to Deferred Revenue</h2>
<p>Since cash is an important part of the deferred revenue calculation, cash balance figures must be accurate for deferred revenue to be reliable. Accounting teams can be confident in their revenue figures by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Performing cash reconciliations to verify that cash activity in the period is accurate</li>
<li>Comparing the deferred revenue roll forward calculation and deferred revenue balance in the general ledger.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the beginning deferred revenue, cash, and ending deferred revenue balances have been substantiated, then there is reasonable assurance that revenue for the period is also correct.</p>
<p>It may seem simple in this example, but calculating deferred revenue can be quite complicated. Because revenue is derived from sales in both the current and prior periods, companies with high volume of transactions and/or multiple product lines may experience additional difficulty calculating deferred revenue.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The software ecosystem has a lot of useful but unsafe code, and the easier it is to sandbox that code, the more
often that’ll happen. If it were as simple as passing the compiler a <code>--sandbox</code> flag
that makes an unsafe library unable to see or affect anything
outside of it, that would be incredible! We can’t get it quite that easy,
but this post describes <strong>WasmBoxC</strong>, a sandboxing approach that is
very simple to use. All you need to do is:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Compile the unsafe library using a <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> (wasm) compiler instead of the normal system compiler</strong>.
That uses wasm internally, but you don’t need to care about that —
all you see is it emits a C file with sandboxed code.</li>
  <li><strong>Write some C to interface with the compiled C of the unsafe library</strong>. (This is
necessary because the sandboxed code can’t access outside memory, and also it
uses the portable wasm ABI.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Compile and link that C code, and now that unsafe library is sandboxed from the rest of your application!
In a later section we’ll see concrete examples of how easy both those steps are.</p>

<p>Here is the approach in more detail:</p>

<p><img src="https://kripken.github.io/blog/assets/wasmboxc.png" alt="unsafe code => safe wasm => safe c => safe native"></p>

<p>By <strong>compiling to wasm</strong> we sandbox the code, preventing it from accessing
anything on the outside.
That includes both <em>memory</em> - the sandboxed code can’t read or write to anywhere outside it -
and <em>capabilities</em> - the sandboxed code can’t do anything but pure computation,
unless you give it a function to call to do things like read from a file, tell
the time, etc.
We also get the rest of the wasm guarantees on
<a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/security/">safety</a> and
<a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/portability/">portability</a>. Wasm
sandboxing is even safe to run in the same process as other code (at least modulo
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)">Spectre-type</a>
vulnerabilities), much like
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Software Fault Isolation (SFI)</a>.</p>

<p>After we’ve compiled an unsafe library to wasm, how can we run it as part of our
application?
We could integrate a wasm VM and run the wasm there. But instead,
with WasmBoxC we take a <strong>VM-less</strong> approach and compile the wasm into native
code, while preserving the wasm semantics, including the sandboxing.
That native code can be linked normally into an application, which
is much simpler than integrating a wasm VM.</p>

<p>The specific approach WasmBoxC takes to compile wasm into native code is to
<strong>compile it to C</strong> using
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt">wabt</a>’s
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/tree/master/wasm2c">wasm2c</a> tool,
and then run a standard C compiler on it. In fact,
WasmBoxC’s approach compiles into a <strong>simple subset of C</strong>.
This is a big part of what makes this approach so simple, and
brings several advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s easy to read and verify the generated C for security.</li>
  <li>It lets us use a C compiler like clang or gcc to make the sandboxed
code very fast.</li>
  <li>It’s very easy to use the code in existing build systems.</li>
  <li>It’s easy to write code to interact with the sandbox.</li>
  <li>A single build of C code can be compiled and run on practically any platform,
and code to interact with the sandbox also only needs to be written once.</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite the simplicity of using C, WasmBoxC sandboxing has low
overhead: just <strong>14%</strong> with some non-portable C code (the
“signal handler trick”, see later), or <strong>42%</strong> in 100% portable C
(with no OS- or CPU-specific operations at all). We’ll also see that there are options
in between those 14% and 42% numbers.</p>

<p>The basic idea in WasmBoxC is simple and
<a href="https://twitter.com/FlohOfWoe/status/1011523018428780544">not original</a>.
What is
new in this post is showing that the approach works, doing
benchmarking on real-world code to show it is fast, presenting complete examples of how
easy it is to sandbox real-world libraries, and writing up the approach in
detail to describe the benefits (see in particular the section on memory-safe
languages).
This post also invents a name for the technique.</p>

<h2 id="speed">Speed</h2>

<p>To get an idea of WasmBoxC’s speed, let’s take a look at
<a href="https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/master/tests/test_benchmark.py">20 benchmarks</a>,
comparing clang 9.0.1, clang 11 (dev version as of May 23 2020), gcc 9.2.1, and
WasmBoxC. All numbers are normalized to clang 9 (which is therefore equal to 1; lower numbers are better).</p>

<p>These benchmarks include a wide variety of code, and the ones prefixed with <code>zzz_</code> are real-world
codebases or benchmarks:
the 
<a href="https://box2d.org/">Box2D</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_(software)">Bullet</a>
physics engines, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coremark">CoreMark</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINPACK_benchmarks">LINPACK</a>
benchmarks, the
<a href="https://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> VM (one GC and one computational benchmark),
the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm">LZMA</a>
and
<a href="https://zlib.net/">zlib</a>
compression libraries,
and the
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a> database.
Incidentally, this shows WasmBoxC can run all of
these today!</p>

<p>Two results are shown for WasmBoxC, representing two implementations of memory sandboxing. The first is <strong>explicit</strong> sandboxing, in which each memory load and store is explicitly verified to be within the sandboxed memory using an explicit check (that is, an <code>if</code> statement is done before each memory access). This has <strong>42%</strong> overhead.</p>

<p>The <strong>OS-based</strong> implementation uses the
“<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/pull/1442/files#diff-e962256d2c336a13791ce03c1dae5d2fR106">signal handler trick</a>” that
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/3334d8dff757051c7a359818e0ceb5ad7852fdbc/js/src/wasm/WasmSignalHandlers.cpp">wasm</a>
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17y4kxuHFrVxAiuCP_FFtFA2HP5sNPsCD10KEx17Hz6M/edit#heading=h.tbi7hpbheoai">VMs</a>
use.
This technique reserves lots of memory around the valid range and relies on
CPU hardware to give us a signal if an access is out of bounds
(for more background see section 3.1.4 in
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Tan, 2017</a>).
That is fully safe and has the benefit of avoiding explicit bounds checks. It has
just <strong>14%</strong> overhead! However, it cannot be used everywhere (it needs
signals and CPU memory protection, and only works on 64-bit systems).</p>

<p>There are more options in between those 14% and 42% figures.
Explicit and OS-based sandboxing preserve wasm semantics perfectly, that is, a trap
will happen exactly when a wasm VM would have trapped. If we are willing to relax
that
(but we may not want to <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/pull/1432">call it wasm</a> if we do)
then we can use masking sandboxing instead
(see section 3.1.3 in
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Tan, 2017</a>),
which is 100% portable like explicit sandboxing and also prevents any accesses
outside of the sandbox, and is somewhat faster at <strong>29%</strong> overhead. Other sandboxing
improvements are possible too - almost no effort has gone into this yet.</p>

<p>An interesting thing happens in the <code>lua_binarytrees</code> and <code>havlak</code> benchmarks,
where WasmBoxC is actually faster than both gcc and clang in all sandboxing modes,
up to 32%! How can we beat normal native builds, and by so much?
<a href="https://twitter.com/kripken/status/1262092956070109185">Looking into this</a>,
both of these benchmarks use a lot of <code>malloc</code>s and data structures with pointers.
Like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X32_ABI">x32 ABI</a>, wasm is 32-bit,
so pointers take half the space. Measuring the maximum process memory used
in <code>lua_binarytrees</code>, WasmBoxC uses 33% less which helps a lot with CPU cache usage.
While this makes a big difference on these two benchmarks, we are likely
getting some speedup on the others as well due to this factor, as on average x32
is faster than normal x64
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X32_ABI#Details">by around 5-8%</a>.
Wasm is a nice way to get something
like x32’s benefits!</p>

<p>The benchmarking here measures performance <em>within</em> the sandbox. It
does not measure the speed of calls from the outside in or inside out. Such
calls can be very fast because the sandboxed code is just C, which means that
we can even inline across the sandbox boundary — safely! — if we do
LTO. I verified that happens in the sandboxing example in the next section,
see later. (Note, however, then using the signal handler trick may make things
more complicated here.)</p>

<p>Some final notes on performance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We can compile WasmBoxC’s C code with any native compiler. In the
above we did so always with clang 9 for simplicity. The results vary a little
when changing the compiler, for example the “explicit” sandboxing results go from
14% up to 16% with gcc 9.2 or down to 11% with clang 11. There’s nothing magical about
that 14% figure — we are at the point where native compiler differences matter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Results should improve over time as wasm adds more performance features
like <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/simd">simd</a> (note that the native compilers we
compared to may have gained an advantage from autovectorization).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That WasmBoxC can reach 14% overhead shows that the
cost of compiling through wasm (which cannot represent irreducible control
flow, for example) is fairly low, and also that current compilers to wasm are
not introducing significant unnecessary overhead.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve done my best to measure everything here carefully and accurately, but
it’s possible I’ve made a mistake somewhere. Please check my work and see if you
get similar results!</p>

<h2 id="ease-of-use">Ease of use</h2>

<p>This section has a full example of WasmBoxC usage. Here are the source files:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// my-code.c</span>

<span>#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</span>
<span>// We could also include the .wasm.h file for these,</span>
<span>// but let's declare externs manually for the example.</span>

<span>extern</span> <span>void</span> <span>wasmbox_init</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>);</span>

<span>extern</span> <span>uint32_t</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>Z_twiceZ_ii</span><span>)(</span><span>uint32_t</span><span>);</span>

<span>extern</span> <span>uint32_t</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>Z_do_bad_thingZ_ii</span><span>)(</span><span>uint32_t</span><span>);</span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>"Initializing sandboxed unsafe library"</span><span>);</span>
  <span>wasmbox_init</span><span>();</span>
  <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Calling twice on 21 returns %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>Z_twiceZ_ii</span><span>(</span><span>21</span><span>));</span>
  <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>"Calling something bad now..."</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Z_do_bad_thingZ_ii</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
  <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>"(this will never be printed, as the bad thing will trap)"</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>main()</code> is pretty simple: Initialize, call something in the sandbox that does a
computation for us, and call something that will trap inside the sandbox.
(What’s with the <code>Z_</code> stuff? See later in “API”.)</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// unsafe-lib.c</span>

<span>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
</span>
<span>__attribute__</span><span>((</span><span>used</span><span>))</span>
<span>int</span> <span>twice</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>__attribute__</span><span>((</span><span>used</span><span>))</span>
<span>int</span> <span>do_bad_thing</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>size</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Allocate an unknown size here (so the LLVM optimizer doesn't know if the</span>
  <span>// store later down is valid or not).</span>
  <span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>malloc</span><span>(</span><span>size</span><span>);</span>
  <span>// Write to an address that is definitely not in the sandbox (the default</span>
  <span>// memory size is much smaller), which in wasm will trap.</span>
  <span>x</span><span>[</span><span>1024</span> <span>*</span> <span>1024</span> <span>*</span> <span>1024</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span><span>;</span>
  <span>// Avoid the optimizer knowing the store can never be observed.</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span><span>)</span><span>x</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>twice()</code> does what you’d expect, and <code>do_bad_thing</code> does a store that will
definitely trap. (Ignore the details there; for this example we need the LLVM optimizer not to
remove the bad code as undefined behavior!)</p>

<p>And here’s how easy it is to use WasmBoxC to get a fully sandboxed library linked with our normal code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># build our main code to an object normally</span>
<span>$ </span>clang my-code.c         <span>-c</span> <span>-O3</span> <span>-o</span> my-code.o

<span># build the unsafe …</span></code></pre></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>

I guess a lot of <code>Node</code> developers have already adopted these features. Some even started using them when these features were still under proposal stages. Yep. My team started using some stage 3 features for quite a while.</p><p>In this article, I'm going to talk about my feelings of using these ES2020 features. As a result, I think those features are great and essential.</p><p>Contents:</p><ul><li><a href="#1-operator-nullish-coalescing">1.

Operator: Nullish Coalescing</a></h2><p>At the beginning, my idea of "providing exlicit explanation of your code" denies such improvement. I think since a value of <code>nullish</code> or <code>falsy</code> should be given a thorough "explanation" under an <code>if condition</code> or some other strategic <code>function</code>. In this way, I could also add some extra logics without refactoring the shorthand expression later.</p><pre><code><span>let</span> website <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span>

  url <span>=</span> website<span>.</span><span>url</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>But I made compromise quickly after trying "nullish coalescing" everywhere in the project. My concern was proved unnecessary. Because what I want is to make sure the target variable has concrete value in most of the scenarios.</p><p>In Typescript, operating a <code>nullish</code> value will probably be given errors or warnings. This means my code can be optimized easily by following the expostulation.</p><pre><code><span>let</span> url<span>:</span> <span>string</span> <span>=</span> website<span>.</span>url <span>??</span> <span>'https://pitayan.com'</span></code></pre><p>In brief, my feeling toward <code>nullish coalescing</code> is quite supportive. It' going to be very helpful while assigning non-nullable value to a variable.</p><h2 id="2-asychronous-modules-dynamic-import"><a href="#2-asychronous-modules-dynamic-import">2. Asychronous Modules: Dynamic import</a></h2><p>I've been using this feature since stage 2. You know, our apps needs that ability of "Just in Time".</p><p>It helps me import Javascript / JSON files as modules in my application. And now it can just show up anywhere in my project (mostly for front end. Haven't experience it on server side).

But <code>finally</code> doesn't provide the correct context I wanted. Don't even have to mention using <code>catch</code> to eat breakfast, that's a bad practice.</p><p>Finally, <code>allSettled</code> permits us to set a callback whenever I wash my face or brush my teeth.

<p>This week I received the latest 14in laptop from Lenovo, the T14s (AMD gen1). Below are some of the tweaks / setup I’ve done on my machine (and generally all my laptops) which typically increase the battery life (with no noticeable reduction in performance).</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated.jpeg"><img src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128.jpeg" alt="" width="700" height="500" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128.jpeg 1800w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128-300x214.jpeg 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128-1024x732.jpeg 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128-768x549.jpeg 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128-1536x1097.jpeg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128.jpeg" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128.jpeg 1800w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128-300x214.jpeg 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128-1024x732.jpeg 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128-768x549.jpeg 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128-1536x1097.jpeg 1536w"></a></p>
<p>The specs are as follows (Lenovo Thinkpad T14s):</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU – 8 Core, 16 Thread – AMD Ryzen 7 Pro 4750u</li>
<li>GPU – AMD Renoir</li>
<li>DISK – 2Tb – M.2 NVME SSD – 970 EVO Plus</li>
<li>RAM – 32 Gb</li>
<li>DISPLAY – 1080p low power (ISP)</li>
<li>KEYBOARD – backlit English</li>
</ul>
<p>As all my machines run on Arch Linux (with Gnome as the GUI), I went ahead and installed the latest build. It worked out of the box, no issues, was up in about an hour.</p>
<p>However, it does requires quite a few optimizations to get power consumption down on a laptop. The goal is always to maximize battery life, while enabling all the functions you’d normally do on a machine.</p>
<h2>BIOS</h2>
<p>On any new laptop, it’s often possible to disable features you don’t need in the BIOS. For instance, any 3rd party software and unused components (such as fingerprint scanner), Bluetooth, etc. can switched off. Often, this will power down those components and save battery.</p>
<p>In this case, I turned off the following components (it’s possible to turn them back on, if needed):</p>
<ul>
<li>Ethernet LAN</li>
<li>USB Port</li>
<li>Memory Card Slot</li>
<li>Smart Card Slot</li>
<li>Fingerprint Reader</li>
</ul>

<p>There is also some 3rd party software which apparently you can also uninstall:</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled.jpeg"><img src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled.jpeg" alt="" width="533" height="142" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled.jpeg 780w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled-300x80.jpeg 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled-768x205.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled.jpeg" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled.jpeg 780w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled-300x80.jpeg 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled-768x205.jpeg 768w"></a></p>
<p>That’s it! It’s possible to later turn on components if necessary. This should result in some minor reductions in power draw.</p>
<h2>TLP or PowerTop</h2>
<p>On the software side, the first step is to install <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Powertop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PowerTop</a>. This lets you manage and monitor <em>almost </em>everything you’ll need related to power consumption: turning off components, increasing system wakes, etc.</p>
<p>This can get rather complex, but for brevity: <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Powertop#Calibration_to_prevent_inaccurate_measurement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">start with calibrating PowerTop</a>. I should note, this will run several measurements, changing screen brightness, fan speed, etc. and will take some time (few minutes), so be prepared:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo powertop --calibrate
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Launch powertop with sudo:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo powertop</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Tab over to “Tunables” and turn on / off various recommendations. This can often result in 5-25% gains in battery life. To set all recommendations to “good”, utilize auto-tune:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo powertop --auto-tune</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This will automatically run all the possible recommendations.</p>
<p>Finally, if you’d like these changes to be persistent (aka not run the command every time you startup the laptop), it’s recommended you create a service:</p>
<pre>/etc/systemd/system/powertop.service</pre>

<p>Then enable the service:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo systemctl enable powertop.service</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This will automatically tune your computer to improve power utilization on boot (although it’ll slow the boot process 1-3 seconds).</p>
<p>It is also important to note that there is <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/TLP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TLP</a>, which also offers a similar service to PowerTop. There are some noticeable differences with TLP. TLP for instance, doesn’t shutdown all connected devices (i.e. PCI devices).</p>
<p>I personally chose TLP, but many other swear by PowerTop.</p>
<p>TLP requires a far more minimal setup:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo systemctl enable tlp.service</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2>Suspend vs Hibernate</h2>
<p>The next improvement that can dramatically improve the time between charges is modifying the suspend behavior.</p>
<p>Don’t know what suspend is?</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Suspend to RAM</strong> – Keep machine state in RAM. This requires keeping the RAM powered, but power is cut to other components of the system (keyboard, monitor, etc.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Essentially, when a laptop lid opens, it instantly boots, often before the laptop is fully ajar. This lets you get “right to work”, but that requires the RAM to be constantly powered.</p>
<p>There is an alternative method, often called <em>Suspend to Disk</em> or <em>Hibernation</em></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Hibernation (Suspend to Disk)</strong> – Saves the machine state into the <a href="https://www.linux.com/news/all-about-linux-swap-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>swap space</em></a> on disk and completely powers off the machine. When the lid is opened / machine is powered on, the machine state is loaded into RAM.</p></blockquote>
<p>The hibernation method can save power for very long periods, as it completely powers down the machine. The drawback is that (at least on my machine) it can take 10-30 seconds to boot into the prior state.</p>
<p>In addition, a <strong>swap file or partition is required</strong>. Note, it is recommend that the swap space is 2-3x than the available RAM.</p>
<p>The beauty, is it’s possible to marry the two methods called: <em>suspend-then-hibernate</em>. It’s possible to <em>suspend</em> for a duration of time (say one hour), then if the laptop isn’t brought out of <em>suspend</em> it will <em>hibernate</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Suspend then Hibernate</strong> – Keep the machine state in RAM for a duration of time, then transition to <em>Hibernation</em> on disk.</p></blockquote>
<p>I should note, it’s also possible to do both <em>suspend</em> and <em>hibernate</em> at the same time, in the case of power loss.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Suspend and Hibernate</strong> – The machine state is copied to the <em>swap space</em> and continues to be stored in RAM. The RAM will continue to draw power, but if power is lost the machine state can be recovered.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Closing the Lid</h2>
<p>The most effective power saving method (as discussed above) is to hibernate, every time.</p>
<p>However, it can be rather annoying to close a laptop, realize you need something, then reopen it and waiting 30 seconds for it to boot.</p>
<blockquote><p>Is a 30 second delay in booting your laptop worth the power savings?</p></blockquote>
<p>Honestly, most people should say it’s a worthy trade. Thirty seconds is a negligible amount of time, given we often open our laptops for hours.</p>
<p>That being said, there’s something primal about being able to open a laptop and being “ready-to-rock” in less than a few seconds. With that in mind, I used the <em>Suspend-then-Hibernate</em> configuration. The <em>suspend-then-hibernate</em> behavior will let the computer quickly boot for some specified amount of time (say 2 hours), after which it will enter the hibernation state.</p>
<h2>Hibernate Configuration</h2>
<p>First, to configure the <em>hibernate</em> behavior, simply edit the following files.</p>
<p>To get <em>hibernate</em> configured, inform GRUB where and how to swap. I personally recommend a swap partition over a swap file as the swap file appears to cause issues in some machines[<a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/6769/hibernate-and-resume-from-a-swap-file" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>].</p>
<p>To accomplish this, find the swap partition, and add the UUID to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT.</p>
<pre><strong>$ sudo lsblk</strong>
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
nvme0n1     259:0    0  1.8T  0 disk 
├─nvme0n1p1 259:1    0    1G  0 part  
├─nvme0n1p2 259:2    0   64G  0 part [SWAP]
└─nvme0n1p3 259:3    0  1.8T  0 part /
<strong>$ sudo lsblk -f | grep SWAP</strong>
├─nvme0n1p2 swap   1 &lt;UUID&gt;  [SWAP]</pre>
<p>Add the resume=UUID=&lt;PARTITION UUID&gt; to the following file:</p>
<pre>/etc/default/grub</pre>

<p>From there, you can start hibernating by adding the MAJ:MIN values for the swap partition to /sys/power/resume with the following command[<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Power_management/Suspend_and_hibernate#Hibernation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a>]:</p>
<pre>sudo echo 259:2 &gt; /sys/power/resume</pre>
<p>It should then be possible to hibernate.</p>
<p>To make the changes to GRUB on boot, execute the following:</p>
<pre>sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg</pre>
<p>At this point, a reboot is recommended.</p>
<h2>Suspend-Then-Hibernate Configuration</h2>
<p>Once it’s possible to enter &amp; wake from the hibernation state, we can then transition to the <em>suspend-then-hibernate</em> step. For this, we have to configure systemd to handle entering <em>hibernation</em> from the <em>suspend</em> state after a given period.</p>
<p>There are two edits here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set a delay in the sleep.conf, which will inform systemd how long to stay in the suspend state before hibernating.</li>
<li>Inform systemd the behavior of the power switch, lid closing, and suspend state.</li>
</ol>
<p>See the file edits below:</p>
<pre>/etc/systemd/sleep.conf</pre>

<pre>/etc/systemd/logind.conf</pre>

<p>The above enables closing the lid or clicking power button to trigger a <em>suspend-then-hibernate state.</em> For the first 45 minutes (in this case), the machine state will be kept in RAM. After 45 minutes (in this case), the machine state will write to disk and power down.</p>
<p>When the lid is next opened, if the machine is in the&nbsp;<em>suspend</em> state (&lt;45 minutes), logging in will take a second or two. If the machine is in the <em>hibernation</em> state, the system will power up, load the machine state into RAM, then let you login (~25-30 seconds).</p>
<h2>Quickly Recovering from Hibernation</h2>
<p>One quick way to speed up recovering from hibernation is to reduce the time the grub menu is up. To edit this, go to:</p>
<pre>/etc/default/grub</pre>
<p>And edit the following command, I changed it from GRUB_TIMEOUT=5 to:</p>
<pre>GRUB_TIMEOUT=1</pre>
<p>This saves an addition 4 seconds on boot, although this does mean you’ll have to act fast if you need to utilize the grub menu. After that, you’ll have to execute the following command for it to take effect:</p>
<pre>sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg</pre>
<p>Beyond speeding up GRUB, you can run the following command to analyze the boot up process via <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Improving_performance/Boot_process" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">systemd-analyze</a>:</p>
<pre>$ sudo systemd-analyze
Startup finished in 5.566s (firmware) + 2.088s (loader) 
+ 1.010s (kernel) + 9.702s (userspace) = 18.368s 
graphical.target reached after 9.614s in userspace</pre>
<p>To get a more detailed list use the blame or critical-chain argument:</p>
<pre>$ sudo systemd-analyze critical-chain
The time when unit became active or started is printed after the "@" character.
The time the unit took to start is printed after the "+" character.

                      └─sysinit.target @874ms
                        └─<a href="https://austingwalters.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="90e3e9e3e4f5fdf4bdf2f1f3fbfcf9f7f8e4d0f2f1f3fbfcf9f7f8e4">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>:amdgpu_bl0.service @2.609s +12ms

<p>In this case, it appears the network manager is the real bottleneck. This is a <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NetworkManager#Enable_NetworkManager_Wait_Online" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">known issue</a>, and can be addressed by disabling the NetworkManager-wait-onine.service. Although, it should be noted this could cause your system to fail to boot, if the network daemons require internet connection (highly unadvised to use such systems on a …</p></div></article></div>

Hardly anybody I know of reads the physical newspaper – in fact the only people I know of are my parents and grandparents. What do the others do? The others open one of the news websites to stay updated with what’s happening. There may be many of us though, who don’t have a fixed website we like to read our news on, and generally open whichever we come across first. Have we ever stopped to think how much the news sites track readers?</p> <h2>Premise</h2><p>With the latest update of Snap Search, we’re now blocking more ads, trackers and analytics than ever before. To test the efficiency, we decided to try various news websites and see how these sites track readers.</p><p>To keep the competition fair, we picked 1 topic which all of them had written about – in this case about TV reporter Victoria Price who was diagnosed with cancer after a viewer emailed her to get a lump on her throat checked.</p><h2>Rules</h2><ol><li>The following list is not in any specific order.</li><li>The number represents a total of blocked requests, which includes ads, trackers and analytics.</li></ol><h2>Let’s Start!</h2><div><figure><img

pure numbers:</p><ul><li><strong>Most blocked resources:</strong> USA Today (46)</li><li><strong>Least blocked resources:</strong> BBC News (9) and The New York Times (9)</li><li><strong>Average over 15 websites:</strong> 23 Resources Blocked</li></ul><p>However, if you’re looking for an answer as to which one is the safest to read your news – I guess it would BBC or NYT <em>based on the numbers alone</em>. A lot of people have their favourites and many simply don’t trust certain news platforms so in the end the decision is on you. Treat this only as a fair warning, or something which you should pay attention to.</p><p>I guess the real question isn’t which one is safe, it’s rather where is it safe. If you’re sure your browser is blocking enough of it, you don’t have much to worry about. You have very less chances of finding a website that does 0 tracking – so you should be equipped to protect yourself from those that do. If you’re an Android user, consider reading the news using <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cybersky.snapsearch">Snap Search 😁</a></p><p>Please remember this was completely out of curiosity while testing the latest version of <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cybersky.snapsearch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Snap Search</a>. Fun fact: Snap Search has a <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://snapsearch.online/tips/reader-mode-for-websites-on-android/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">really cool reader mode</a> for comfortably reading your news.</p><p>Also, does anybody have any more ideas on more such lists that can be made?</p><p>PS: Don’t forget to share and spread the word 🙂</p></div></div></div>]]>

I reach the conclusion that high performance algorithms that are labeled as specific to a certain type of data can be made generic or that the generic algorithms aren't really that generic either. I end up proposing a new form of function that can be fed to a sorting function in order to reach better performance than the classic O(n*log(n)). Extra bonus: finding distinct values in a list.</p> <h2>Sorting</h2> <p>&nbsp; But first, what is sorting? Given a list of items that can be compared to one another as lower or higher, return the list in the order from lowest to highest. Since an item can be any type of data record, to define a generic sorting algorithm we need to feed it the rules that make an item lower than another and that is called the comparison function. Let's try an example in Javascript:</p>  <pre><code>  // random function from start to end inclusive
  function rand(start, end) {
    return parseInt(start + Math.random() * (end - start + 1));
  }
  
  // measure time taken by an action and output it in console
  let perfKey = 0;
  function calcPerf(action) {
    const key = perfKey++;
    performance.mark('start_' + key);
    action();
    performance.mark('end_' + key);
    const measure = performance.measure('measure_' + key, 'start_' + key, 'end_' + key);
    console.log('Action took ' + measure.duration);
  }
  
  // change this based on how powerful the computer is
  const size = 10000000;
  // the input is a list of size 'size' containing random values from 1 to 50000
  const input = [];
  for (let i = 0; i &lt; size; i++)
    input.push(rand(1, 50000));
  
  // a comparison function between two items a and b
  function comparisonFunction(a, b) {
    if (a &gt; b)
      return 1;
    if (a &lt; b)
      return -1;
    return 0;
  }
  
  const output = [];
  // copy input into output, then sort it using the comparison function
  // same copying method will be used for future code
  calcPerf(() =&gt; {
    for (let i = 0; i &lt; size; i++)
      output.push(input[i]);
    output.sort(comparisonFunction);
  });
</code></pre> <p>&nbsp; It's not the crispest code in the world, but it's simple to understand:</p> <ul><li>calcPerf is computing the time it takes for an action to take and logs it to the console</li> <li>start by creating a big array of random numbers as input</li> <li>the array in a result array and sorting it with the default sort function, to which we give the comparison function</li> <li>display the time it took for the operation.</li></ul> <p>&nbsp; This takes about 4500 milliseconds on my computer.</p> <p>&nbsp; Focus on the comparison function. It takes two items and returns a number that is -1, 0 or 1 depending on whether the first item is smaller, equal or larger than the second. Now let's consider the sorting algorithm itself. How does it work?</p> <p>&nbsp; A naive way to do it would be to find the smallest item in the list, move it to the first position in the array, then continue the process with the rest of the array. This would have a complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>). If you don't know what the O complexity is, don't worry, it just provides an easy to spell approximation of how the amount of work would increase with the number of items in the input. In this case, 10 million records, squared, would lead to 100 trillion operations! That's not good.</p> <p>&nbsp; Other algorithms are much better, bringing the complexity to O(n*log(n)), so assuming base 10, around 70 million operations. But how do they improve on this? Surely in order to sort all items you must compare them to each other. The explanation is that if a&lt;b and b&lt;c you do not need to compare a to c. And each algorithm tries to get to this in a different way.</p> <p>&nbsp; However, the basic logic of sorting remains the same: compare all items with a subset of the other items.</p> <h2>Partitioning</h2> <p>&nbsp; A very common and recommended sorting algorithm is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="sometimes called partition-exchange sort, Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.">QuickSort</a>. I am not going to go through the entire history of sorting algorithms and what they do, you can check that out yourself, but I can focus on the important innovation that QuickSort added: partitioning. The first step in the algorithm is to choose a value out of the list of items, which the algorithm hopes it's as close as possible to the median value and is called a pivot, then arrange the items in two partitions: the ones smaller than the pivot and the ones larger than the pivot. Then it proceeds on doing the same to each partition until the partitions are small enough to be sorted by some other sort algorithm, like insertion sort (used by Chrome by default).</p> <p>&nbsp; Let's try to do this manually in our code, just the very first run of the step, to see if it improves the execution time. Lucky for us, we know that the median is around 25000, as the input we generated contains random numbers from 1 to 50000. So let's copy the values from input into two output arrays, then sort each of them. The sorted result would be reading from the first array, then from the second!</p>  <pre><code>  // two output arrays, one for numbers below 25000, the other for the rest
  const output1 = [];
  const output2 = [];
  const pivot = 25000;
  
  calcPerf(() =&gt; {
    for (let i = 0; i &lt; size; i++) {
      const val = input[i];
      if (comparisonFunction(val, pivot) &lt; 0)
        output1.push(val);
      else
        output2.push(val);
    }
    // sorting smaller arrays is cheaper
    output1.sort(comparisonFunction);
    output2.sort(comparisonFunction);
  });
</code></pre> <p>&nbsp; Now, the performance is slightly better. If we do this several times, the time taken would get even lower. The partitioning of the array by an operation that is essentially O(n) (we just go once through the entire input array) reduces the comparisons that will be made in each partition. If we would use the naive sorting, partitioning would reduce n<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>to n+(n/2)<sup>2</sup>+(n/2)<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;(once for each partitioned half), thus n+n<sup>2</sup>/2. Each partitioning almost halves the number of operations!</p> <p>&nbsp; So, how many times can we half the number of operations for? Imagine that we do this with an array of distinct values, from 1 to 10 million. In the end, we would get to partitions of just one element and that means we did a log<sub>2</sub>(n) number of operations and for each we added one n (the partitioning operation). That means that the total number of operations is... n*log(n). Each algorithm gets to this in a different way, but at the core of it there is some sort of partitioning, that b value that makes comparing a and c unnecessary.</p> <p>&nbsp; Note that we treated the sort algorithm as "generic", meaning we fed it a comparison function between any two items, as if we didn't know how to compare numbers. That means we could have used any type of data as long as we knew the rule for comparison between items.</p> <p>&nbsp; There are other types of sorting algorithms that only work on specific types of data, though. Some of them claim a complexity of O(n)! But before we get to them, let's make a short detour.</p> <h3>Distinct values</h3> <p>&nbsp; Another useful operation with lists of items is finding the list of distinct items. From [1,2,2,3] we want to get [1,2,3]. To do this, we often use something called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="an ordered tree data structure used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings. Unlike a binary search tree, no node in the tree stores the key associated with that node; instead, its position in the tree defines the key with which it is associated; i.e., the value of the key is distributed across the structure.">trie</a>, a tree-like data structure that is used for quickly finding if a value exists or not in a list. It's the thing used for autocorrect or finding a word in a dictionary. It has an O(log n) complexity in checking if an item exists. So in a list of 10 million items, it would take maybe 20 operations to find the item exists or not. That's amazing! You can see that what it does is partition the list down to the item level.</p> <p>&nbsp; Unfortunately, this only works for numbers and strings and such primitive values. If we want to make it generic, we need to use a function that determines when two items are equal and then we use it to compare to all the other items we found as distinct so far. That makes using a trie impossible.</p> <p>&nbsp; Let me give you an example: we take [1,1,2,3,3,4,5] and we use an externally provided equality function:</p> <ul><li>create an empty output of distinct items</li> <li>take first item (1) and compare with existing distinct items (none)</li> <li>item is not found, so we add it to output</li> <li>take next item (1) and compare with existing distinct items (1)</li> <li>item is found, so we do nothing</li> <li>...</li> <li>we take the last item (5) and compare with existing items (1,2,3,4)</li> <li>item is not found, so we add it to the output</li></ul> <p>&nbsp; The number of operations that must be taken is the number of total items multiplied by the average number of distinct items. That means that for a list of already distinct values, the complexity if O(n<sup>2</sup>). Not good! It increases exponentially with the number of items. And we cannot use a trie unless we have some function that would provide us with a distinctive primitive value for an item. So instead of an equality function, a hashing function that would return a number or maybe a string.</p> <p>&nbsp; However, given the knowledge we have so far, we can reduce the complexity of finding distinct items to O(n*log(n))! It's as simple as sorting the items, then going through the list and sending to output an item when different from the one before. One little problem here: we need a comparison function for sorting, not an equality one.</p> <h2>So far</h2> <p>&nbsp; We looked into the basic operations of sorting and finding distinct values. To be generic, one has to be provided with a comparison function, the other with an equality function. However, if we would have a comparison function available, finding distinct generic items would become significantly less complex by using sorting. Sorting is better than exponential comparison because it uses partitioning as an optimization trick.</p> <h2>Breaking the n*log(n) barrier</h2> <p>&nbsp; As I said above, there are algorithms that claim a much better performance than n*log(n). One of them is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="a non-comparative sorting algorithm. It avoids comparison by creating and distributing elements into buckets according to their radix. For elements with more than one significant digit, this bucketing process is repeated for each digit, while preserving the ordering of the prior step, until all digits have been considered. For this reason, radix sort has also been called bucket sort and digital sort.">RadixSort</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burstsort" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="cache-efficient algorithms for sorting strings. They are variants of the traditional radix sort but faster for large data sets of common strings, first published in 2003, with some optimizing versions published in later years.">BurstSort</a> is a version of it, optimized for strings. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_sort" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="an algorithm for sorting a collection of objects according to keys that are small integers; that is, it is an integer sorting algorithm. It operates by counting the number of objects that have each distinct key value, and using arithmetic on those counts to determine the positions of each key value in the output sequence.">CountSort</a> is a similar algorithm, as well. The only problem with Radix type algorithms is that they only work on numbers or recursively on series of numbers. How do they do that? Well, since we know we have numbers to sort, we can use math to partition the lot …</p></div></div>

        <p>Much advocacy of Haskell, in general, boils down to type-safety and elimination of bugs. How boring. My personal experience is that bugs are trickier in Haskell and I can write bad code in an extraordinary variety of ways.</p>
<p>I don’t code in Haskell to help eliminate bugs. That seems a goal unlikely to produce joy in my code. I write Haskell primarily because in enables me to name things a bit better.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-learning">What is Learning?</h2>
<p>As an example, I came across this quote within the first few pages of a popular online course on machine learning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. ~ Tom Mitchell</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s how I unpacked this into types:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | learning is to use experience to change the performance of a task.</span>
<span>newtype</span> <span>Learn</span> f e p <span>=</span>
  <span>Learn</span> { change <span>::</span> (<span>Foldable</span> f) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Experience</span> f e <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Task</span> e p <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Task</span> e p }

</code></pre></div><p>A common approach to newtypes is to label the unwrapping as a reversal of the newtype (such as <code>unlearn</code> or <code>unLearn</code>) but this misses an important naming opportunity: to use a Learn is to change.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | An experience is set of e's</span>
<span>newtype</span> <span>Experience</span> f e <span>=</span> <span>Experience</span> { set <span>::</span> f e }
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | A task takes an e and measures performance.</span>
<span>newtype</span> <span>Task</span> e p <span>=</span> <span>Task</span> { measure <span>::</span> e <span>-&gt;</span> p } <span>deriving</span> (<span>Profunctor</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>This could be thought of (and coded) as an ordinary function with type (e -&gt; p). The advantage of using a newtype, however, is to highlight the two ways that a task can change:</p>
<ul>
<li>changing the way a task is performed (the <code>e</code>).</li>
<li>changing the way a task is measured (the <code>p</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Acting on a learning, you can change the way a task is performed, such as changing parameters of a function, or change the way you view what performance is.</p>
<p>To change the way a task is performed, taking experience into account, is to make progress. Progress is made one step at a time.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | To progress, is to transduce a Task, via a carrier</span>
<span>newtype</span> <span>Progress</span> e p <span>=</span> <span>Progress</span> { step <span>::</span> e <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Task</span> e p <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Task</span> e p}
</code></pre></div><p>Putting these above types together in a useful way, to learn, is then to repeatedly apply a progressive step to a set of experiences.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | to learn, is to make Progress from an Experience.</span>
<span>learn</span> <span>::</span> <span>Progress</span> e p <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Learn</span> f e p
<span>learn</span> p <span>=</span> <span>Learn</span> $ <span>\</span>(<span>Experience</span> e) task <span>-&gt;</span> foldr (step p) task e
</code></pre></div><p>To <code>machine learn</code>, we change the way a <code>machine</code> does a task, based on learning, measuring whether performance improves, and adopt the new way to do a task if it does.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | to improve, given a way to change a task by experience, </span>
<span>--</span>
<span>-- you need to choose the better performace way over an experience set.</span>
<span>improve</span> <span>::</span>
  (<span>Ord</span> (f p), <span>Foldable</span> f, <span>Functor</span> f) <span>=&gt;</span>
  <span>Progress</span> e p <span>-&gt;</span>
  <span>Experience</span> f e <span>-&gt;</span>
  <span>Task</span> e p <span>-&gt;</span>
  <span>Task</span> e p
<span>improve</span> progress es task <span>=</span>
  bool task task' (p' &gt; p)
  <span>where</span>
    task' <span>=</span> change (learn progress) es task
    p <span>=</span> measure task &lt;$&gt; set es
    p' <span>=</span> measure task' &lt;$&gt; set es
</code></pre></div><p>The constraints contained in the above code are mostly based on suggestions from ghc to get a compile, and I didn’t think about them much in drafting. Type constraints provide useful guide-rails for future development of these ideas.</p>
<h2 id="machine-learning-in-haskell">Machine Learning in Haskell?</h2>
<p>In the above example of improving we are left with an <code>Ord (f p)</code> constraint - that the performance over an experience set is ordinal. If we narrow the constraint to a <code>Num (f p)</code>, in other words, assume that the size of the <code>f p</code> is meaningful, then we have wandered in to the traditional numerical methods domain, and can, for example, start to think about gradients to speed up our improvement.</p>
<p>By insisting on useful and concrete names (aka types), Haskell supplies a constrained domain we can further explore.  For example, are there machine learning examples that don’t fit the candidate types and constraints?</p>
<p>Naming things is hard, and other ways of coding tend to avoid the task. Types bring me joy and I shall keep them, thank you very much, and continue to curate collections of them, for fun and profit. In this example, I now have as good a definition of machine learning as you’ll find out in the wild, and my progress on machine learning will be more comprehensive, faster and safer than bashing away in python.</p>
<p>And yet, to a first degree, machine learning in Haskell does not exist, swamped by the easiness of dynamic types. If the promises being made by ML are to be eventually honoured, however, it may need less code bashing and better naming.</p>

"And the fact that we see the same trend in Ireland, in Denmark in Australia, it's kind of surprising for everyone working in this field."</p>  <p>Preterm birth comes with a host of challenges for the babies and their parents.</p>  <p>"The risk is high on children and their families, and also medical care resources," Alshaikh said. "For children, the risk increases for vision and hearing problems, and also for learning disability. It's higher even as the gestational age goes down. For example,&nbsp; 24 weeks is at very high risk compared to babies born at 28 weeks gestation or at 32 weeks gestation."</p>  <h2>Doctors teaming up to study</h2>  <p>The Calgary doctors will continue to study the phenomenon, which could hold clues to reducing preterm births in general.</p>  <p>For now, Alshaikh said it's too early to provide any specific advice to pregnant woman — other than to avoid stress, try to rest at home, get a lot of sleep&nbsp;and focus on good nutrition.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"We've teamed up, actually, with the teams across the world, in Ireland and also in Denmark, and there is also a group in Manitoba working on this project, and we are hoping to understand more the ways to prevent the preterm birth, and also like to see if we can understand more on risk factors that are affecting preterm birth," Alshaikh said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>But the Calgary doctor said there is one alarming development already —&nbsp;as the lockdown restriction ease, those preterm birth numbers are already on the rise again.</p>  <p>"We are actually noticing, even in Calgary, that when the restrictions started to be eased, the number of preterm babies coming to our unit and intensive care is going up again, which is quite actually interesting for us," Alshaikh said. "And we are trying to tease out what factors are affecting this trend."</p>  <p><strong>With files from <em><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/listen/live-radio/1-97-the-homestretch">The Homestretch</a></em>.</strong></p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><h3>What is the Blueprint?</h3>

<p>The Draft Blueprint ("the Blueprint") is the "first draft" of Plan Bay Area 2050, integrating 25 resilient and equitable strategies from the predecessor <a href="https://www.planbayarea.org/2050-plan/horizon">Horizon initiative</a>. The Blueprint is a critical step in the Plan Bay Area 2050 process as the region strives to advance towards the adopted Vision of a more affordable, connected, diverse, healthy and vibrant Bay Area for all.</p>

<h3>We Need Your Input</h3>

<p><strong>Public input is key in the success of the Plan Bay Area 2050 Blueprint, and we want to hear from you in 3 easy steps:</strong></p>

<h3>From <em>Horizon</em> to the Blueprint to the Plan</h3>

<p>Before now, the Horizon Initiative tested strategies against a wide range of external forces, exploring which policies and investments were best prepared for an uncertain future – from rising telecommute levels to economic boom &amp; bust cycles to consumer preference shifts. Creating the Blueprint is a key first step toward creating the Plan itself, and thus the Blueprint planning phase will require iteration and deep engagement of the public, stakeholders and elected officials.</p>

<p>The Plan Bay Area 2050 Draft Blueprint weaves together transportation, housing, economic and environmental strategies, alongside an expanded set of growth geographies, to advance critical climate and equity goals. Designed to accommodate the 1.5 million new homes necessary to house future growth and address overcrowding, as well as 1.4 million new jobs, the Draft Blueprint integrates critical strategies to address our severe and longstanding housing crisis. With infrastructure investments in walking, biking and public transportation – as well as critical sea level protections designed to keep most Bay Area communities from flooding through 2050 – the Draft Blueprint makes meaningful steps towards the adopted Plan Bay Area 2050 Vision.</p>

<p>While still remaining fiscally constrained per federal planning requirements, the Draft Blueprint includes available revenues from Needs and Revenue assessments as well as new regional revenues for transportation, housing, economic development and environmental resilience.</p>

<h3>Highlights of the Draft Blueprint include:</h3>

<ul><li><strong>Improving Affordability for All:</strong> The Draft Blueprint reduces the cost burden for housing and transportation, with even greater reductions for low-income residents.</li>
	<li><strong>Expanding Housing Opportunities:</strong> The Draft Blueprint integrates investments to build more than 400,000 new permanently-affordable homes.</li>
	<li><strong>Focusing Growth in Walkable Places:</strong> The Draft Blueprint focuses the majority of new homes and new jobs in walkable communities with frequent transit services.</li>
	<li><strong>Saving Lives and Protecting Communities:</strong> In addition to saving more than 1,500 lives from roadway crashes through 2050, the Draft Blueprint also protects 98 percent of housing units at risk of sea level rise inundation through the year 2050 with new resilient infrastructure.</li>
	<li><strong>Positioning the Region for Robust Economic Growth:</strong> Despite over $200 billion in new taxes in the decades ahead to pay for the bold strategies approved in February 2020, Bay Area businesses are forecasted to rebound robustly.</li>
</ul></div></div></div></div>]]>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a id="introduction"></a><a href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>This document is a gentle introduction to the double-entry counting method, as written from the perspective of a computer scientist. It is an attempt to explain basic bookkeeping using as simple an approach as possible, doing away with some of the idiosyncrasies normally involved in accounting. It is also representative of how <a href="http://furius.ca/beancount/"><span>Beancount</span></a> works, and it should be useful to all users of <a href="http://plaintextaccounting.org/"><span>plain-text accounting</span></a>.</p>
<p>Note that I am not an accountant, and in the process of writing this document I may have used terminology that is slightly different or unusual to that which is taught in perhaps more traditional training in accounting. I granted myself license to create something new and perhaps even unusual in order to explain those ideas as simply and clearly as possible to someone unfamiliar with them.</p>
<p>I believe that the method of double-entry counting should be taught to everyone at the high school level everywhere as it is a tremendously useful organizational skill, and I hope that this text can help spread its knowledge beyond professional circles.</p>
<h2 id="basics-of-double-entry-bookkeeping">Basics of Double-Entry Bookkeeping<a id="basics-of-double-entry-bookkeeping"></a><a href="#basics-of-double-entry-bookkeeping" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>The double-entry system is just a simple <em>method of counting</em>, with some simple rules.</p>
<p>Let’s begin by defining the notion of an <strong>account</strong>. An account is something that can contain things, like a bag. It is used to count things, to accumulate things. Let’s draw a horizontal arrow to visually represent the evolving contents of an account over time:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/5b1da6643866c557b2a5ce687e70ee1db16b14de.png"></p>
<p>On the left, we have the past, and to the right, increasing time: the present, the future, etc.</p>
<p>For now, let’s assume that accounts can contain only one kind of thing, for example, <em>dollars</em>. All accounts begin with an empty content of zero dollars. We will call the number of units in the account the <strong>balance</strong> of an account. Note that it represents its contents at a particular point in time. I will draw the balance using a number above the account’s timeline:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/842dcb36da9e0e70c35d1023d65d8a571062baf0.png"></p>
<p>The contents of accounts can change over time. In order to change the content of an account, we have to add something to it. We will call this addition a <strong>posting</strong> to an account, and I will draw this change as a circled number on the account’s timeline, for example, adding $100 to the account:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/5e5e7897a346355eccd4d21ec9485c3464a2d996.png"></p>
<p>Now, we can draw the updated balance of the account after the posting with another little number right after it:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/0c8a78dac61ae7fddde25761f036e7f379cad247.png"></p>
<p>The account’s balance, after adding $100, is now $100.</p>
<p>We can also remove from the contents of an account. For example, we could remove $25, and the resulting account balance is now $75:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/98e314125325ecc72262a73a21b74db3200414fd.png"></p>
<p>Account balances can also become <em>negative</em>, if we remove more dollars than there are in the account. For example, if we remove $200 from this account, the balance now becomes $-125:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/bdc8a23347040de123e3359a7c8f0cc253c6d7d2.png"></p>
<p>It’s perfectly fine for accounts to contain a negative balance number. Remember that all we’re doing is counting things. As we will see shortly, some accounts will remain with a negative balance for most of their timeline.</p>
<h3 id="statements">Statements<a id="statements"></a><a href="#statements" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Something worthy of notice is how the timeline notation I’ve written in the previous section is analogous to paper account statements institutions maintain for each client and which you typically receive through the mail:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th><em><strong>Date</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Description</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Amount</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Balance</strong></em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2016-10-02</td><td>...</td><td>100.00</td><td>1100.00</td></tr><tr><td>2016-10-05</td><td>...</td><td>-25.00</td><td>1075.00</td></tr><tr><td>2016-10-06</td><td>...</td><td>-200.00</td><td>875.00</td></tr><tr><td><em><strong>Final Balance</strong></em></td><td>875.00</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Sometimes the amount column is split into two, one showing the positive amounts and the other the negative ones:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th><em><strong>Date</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Description</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Debit</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Credit</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Balance</strong></em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2016-10-02</td><td>...</td><td></td><td>100.00</td><td>1100.00</td></tr><tr><td>2016-10-05</td><td>...</td><td>25.00</td><td></td><td>1075.00</td></tr><tr><td>2016-10-06</td><td>...</td><td>200.00</td><td></td><td>875.00</td></tr><tr><td><em><strong>Final Balance</strong></em></td><td>875.00</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Here, “debit” means “removed from your account” and “credit” means “deposited in your account.” Sometimes the words “withdrawals” and “deposits” will be used. It all depends on context: for checking and savings accounts it is usual to have both types of postings, but for a credit card account typically it shows only positive numbers and then the occasional monthly payment so the single column format is used.</p>
<p>In any case, the “balance” column always shows the resulting balance <em>after</em> the amount has been posted to the account. And sometimes the statements are rendered in decreasing order of time.</p>
<h3 id="single-entry-bookkeeping">Single-Entry Bookkeeping<a id="single-entry-bookkeeping"></a><a href="#single-entry-bookkeeping" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>In this story, this account belongs to someone. We’ll call this person the <strong>owner</strong> of the account. The account can be used to represent a real world account, for example, imagine that we use it to represent the content of the owner’s checking account at a bank. So we’re going to label the account by giving it a name, in this case “Checking”:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/380ec8fea9ee9069411a61ccabcc838de44042ef.png"></p>
<p>Imagine that at some point, this account has a balance of $1000, like I’ve drawn on the picture. Now, if the owner spends $79 of this account, we would represent it like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/b24d8c1e40edf6fd7e9d768ba8f0df279cd41f0e.png"></p>
<p>Furthermore, if the expense was for a meal at a restaurant, we could flag the posting with a <strong>category</strong> to indicate what the change was used for. Let’s say, “Restaurant”, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/7ee843cd9b997a9447bb022d7d35121a820e296d.png"></p>
<p>Now, if we have a lot of these, we could write a computer program to accumulate all the changes for each category and calculate the sums for each of them. That would tell us how much we spent in restaurants in total, for example. This is called the <strong>single-entry method</strong> of accounting.</p>
<p>But we’re not going to do it this way; we have a better way. Bear with me for a few more sections.</p>
<h3 id="double-entry-bookkeeping">Double-Entry Bookkeeping<a id="double-entry-bookkeeping"></a><a href="#double-entry-bookkeeping" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>An owner may have multiple accounts. I will represent this by drawing many similar account timelines on the same graphic. As before, these are labeled with unique names. Let’s assume that the owner has the same “Checking” account as previously, but now also a <strong>“</strong>Restaurant<strong>”</strong> account as well, which can be used to accumulate all food expenses at restaurants. It looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/3c380375442a643877c59660832bd7df6192e9cb.png"></p>
<p>Now, instead of <em>categorizing</em> the posting to a “restaurant category” as we did previously, we could create a matching posting on the “Restaurant” account to record how much we spent for food, with the amount spent ($79):</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/b86a7242b92effc613f88bc0cc70381d72e774f0.png"></p>
<p>The “Restaurant” account, like all other accounts, also has an accumulated balance, so we can find out how much we spent in “Restaurant” in total. This is entirely symmetrical to counting changes in a checking account.</p>
<p>Now, we can associate the two postings together, by creating a kind of “parent” box that refers to both of them. We will call this object a <strong>transaction</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/b77efafcf2d6a6f1afbfb13da70be2f892b339b4.png"></p>
<p>Notice here that we’ve also associated a description to this transaction: “Dinner at Uncle Boons”. A transaction also has a <strong>date</strong>, and all of its postings are recorded to occur on that date. We call this the transaction date.</p>
<p>We can now introduce the fundamental rule of double-entry bookkeeping system:</p>
<pre><code>The sum of all the postings of a transaction must equal zero.
</code></pre>
<p>Remember this, as this is the foundation of the double-entry method, and its most important characteristic. It has important consequences which I will discuss later in this document.</p>
<p>In our example, we remove $79 from the “Checking” account and “give it” to the “Restaurant” account. ($79) + ($-79) = $0. To emphasize this, I could draw a little summation line under the postings of the transaction, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/b4182b9f64113868123cbcec20d468ab18b2786f.png"></p>
<h3 id="many-accounts">Many Accounts<a id="many-accounts"></a><a href="#many-accounts" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>There may be many such transactions, over many different accounts. For example, if the owner of the accounts had a lunch the next day which she paid using a credit card, it could be represented by creating a “Credit Card” account dedicated to tracking the real world credit card balance, and with a corresponding transaction:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/f85a66510ce2e3bb614edca76463a9c4752a7d26.png"></p>
<p>In this example, the owner spent $35 at a restaurant called “Eataly.” The previous balance of the owner’s credit card was $-450; after the expense, the new balance is $-485.</p>
<p>For each real world account, the owner can create a bookkeeping account like we did. Also, for each category of expenditure, the owner also creates a bookkeeping account. In this system, there are no limits to how many accounts can be created.</p>
<p>Note that the balance in the example is a negative number; this is not an error. Balances for credit card accounts are normally negative: they represent an amount <em>you owe</em>, that the bank is lending you <em>on credit</em>. When your credit card company keeps track of your expenses, they write out your statement from their perspective, as positive numbers. For you, those are amounts you need to eventually pay. But here, in our accounting system, we’re representing numbers from the owner’s point-of-view, and from her perspective, this is money she owes, not something she has. What we have is a meal sitting in our stomach (a positive number of $ of “Restaurant”).</p>
<h3 id="multiple-postings">Multiple Postings<a id="multiple-postings"></a><a href="#multiple-postings" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Finally, transactions may have more than two postings; in fact, they may have any number of postings. The only thing that matters is that the sum of their amounts is zero (from the rule of double-entry bookkeeping above).</p>
<p>For example, let’s look at what would happen if the owner gets her salary paid for December:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/18980f41275676c5c7cf3b39dd256512bb45b78b.png"></p>
<p>Her gross salary received in this example is recorded as $-2,905 (I’ll explain the sign in a moment). $905 is set aside for taxes. Her “net” salary of $2,000, the remainder, is deposited in her “Checking” account and the resulting balance of that account is $2,921 (the previous balance of $921 + $2,000 = $2,921). This transaction has three postings: (+2,000) + (-2,905) + (+905) = 0. The double-entry rule is respected.</p>
<p>Now, you may ask: Why is her salary recorded as a negative number? The reasoning here is similar to that of the credit card above, though perhaps a bit more subtle. These accounts exist to track all the amounts from the owner’s point-of-view. The owner gives out work, and receives money and taxes in exchange for it …</p></div></div></div>

    <h2 id="internally">Internally</h2>
<p>I’ve managed a few small teams, and the worst situations always happen when I avoid conflict early.</p>
<p>Hypothetically, if Sam does 3 problematic things, I might only address 2 of them. Maybe I don’t want Sam to think I’m mean, or maybe I need Sam to stay encouraged. Regardless of my intent, it becomes increasingly difficult for me to address that 3rd behavior, and increasingly burdensome to spin my wheels serving as an unnecessary intermediary in Sam’s interactions, trying to create a buffer between that 3rd behavior and the rest of the office. This is obviously stupid and unsustainable, and becomes more awkward to correct over time.</p>
<p>This often creeps up in more subtle ways. A developer might provide a lot of critical feedback on every new round of designs. I want the designer to feel empowered and trusted, but I also want the developer to care about the overall product. It’s perfectly possible to strike a good balance &amp; accurately communicate with everybody… However, it’s human-instinct to optimize each message for the receiver, and to sliiiightly oversell the degree to which I agree with the developer’s criticisms, or to soften those same criticisms when speaking with the designer. These little tweaks, which feel like hard work &amp; good management in the short-term, can really snowball over time.</p>

  <p><img src="https://gazzini.com/essays/posts/alignment/expectations.jpg" alt="A graph with time on the X axis and reckoning on the Y axis. It demonstrates that for any initial degree of misunderstanding, the expectations deviate further from reality until it is corrected."></p><p>To minimize the magnitude of reckoning:</p>
<ul>
<li>A good manager will force the reckoning sooner</li>
<li>A great manager will avoid the misalignment in the first place</li>
<li>An excellent manager will avoid this misalignment without making anyone feel bad</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="externally">Externally</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, many people believe that the role of a great recruiter (or salesperson, marketer, director, or anybody) is to actually increase the degree of misalignment in the above graph… In other words, that they should oversell. In a large enough company, someone else downstream will have to deal with the reckoning:</p>

  <p><img src="https://gazzini.com/essays/posts/alignment/before.jpg" alt="A graph where most recruiters tell the truth, but 1 evil recruiter lies and is rewarded for it."></p><p>If this incentive system goes unchecked, it quickly devolves into a situation where everybody knows that everybody oversells, and so the common wisdom is to mentally discount any promise made by a salesperson, recruiter, marketer, engineer, or really anybody:</p>

  <p><img src="https://gazzini.com/essays/posts/alignment/after.jpg" alt="A graph where most recruiters lie, but the candidates all adjust their expectations accordingly. This causes the truthful recruiters to suffer, because their truth is also discounted."></p><p>I’ve noticed that a lot of mentorship involves helping newcomers recognize the overselling for themselves &amp; learn to navigate these worlds of semi-truths &amp; complex incentives. I’ve also noticed that this flavor of BS is always bad for the overall system / company / marketplace / world.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Externally, this pattern is unavoidable. Free markets will always be susceptible to some assumed misalignment, although regulations can help.</p>
<p>Within a company, however, this behavior is toxic. Whenever I see a team sugar-coating metrics, I know that it won’t be fun to work in implementation at that company. When the rubber meets the road, the fingers will start pointing.</p>
<h2 id="misc">Misc</h2>
<p>Here are some other things that I did to make myself miserable as a new manager:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lacking the confidence to make hard decisions, and offloading them to someone more confident but less informed</li>
<li>Waiting waaaay too long to fire people</li>
<li>Reading a lot of books on management, and expecting <em>my</em> manager to immediately live the ideals of those specific books</li>
<li>Trying to manage former peers without intentionally, drastically resetting the relationship</li>
</ul>
<p>I can avoid most of these by constantly asking myself what issues I’m avoiding today, and pursuing the ones that might turn into big issues later.</p>

        <div>
                        
            
            
<p>The past few years have seen many different SaaS apps pop up and appeal to businesses. From CDPs to AI, to session replay, there have been many different advanced platforms marketers can add to their toolbelts. One of my personal favorite tools over the past few years has been FullStory. FullStory is a session replay web app that allows site owners to literally watch what a user does on their website – in full video. Previously martech folks were stuck with heat mapping software like Kissmetrics and HotJar – and even to a lesser extent Google Analytics. While these tools were certainly helpful in addressing which parts of a web page were clicked on or interacted with the most, they were static interpretations of the data. </p>



<div><p>Tools like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fullstory.com/" target="_blank">FullStory </a>and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.clicktale.com/" target="_blank">Clicktale </a>take these one step further and actually provide real-time playback of what a user is doing on a website. This is also possible across sessions and even can follow a user from signup all the way through onboarding – it’s really up to you. At first glance, this seems like a godsend. The ability to actually watch what people do on your site – where they get stuck or what they’re reading when they ultimately convert or exit is one of the more powerful funnel optimization tools to come out in the past decade. I personally can attest to their efficacy. They helped me drop a SaaS CAC from $1,250 to $100 in 3 months. </p><p>There are many other instances in which I have gone into a business, implemented one of these tools, and improved conversion rates by an order of magnitude in a fraction of the time it used to take. In just a few days of watching sessions it is possible to tell:</p></div>



<ul><li>What is preventing users from converting</li><li>Where are customers losing interest in the page</li><li>Why people are dropping out of the checkout process</li><li>What content users focus in on and what they skim past</li><li>What part of the site or app crashed and how did it happen</li></ul>



<p>These are all incredibly powerful insights in the hands of a skilled marketer, so what gives? Why doesn’t everyone secretly record their users and optimize based on the data? First, its helpful to understand what session replay is, and what it isn’t…</p>



<h2>What EXACTLY is Session Replay?</h2>



<p>Session Replay is precisely what it sounds like – the ability for the site owner, or someone else, to replay the session a specific user experienced while on the site. It includes scroll activity, mouse activity, clicks, swipes, taps, and just about any other action you can think of on a website. It has a lot of other names but session replay is generally the widely accepted term that these SaaS platforms use themselves.</p>



<p>It lets you see EXACTLY where someone gets stuck so that you can design a way to fix it and reduce the friction within whatever action you’re trying to get a user to take. It can also let you remotely diagnose speed or loading issues for customers – taking it one step beyond tools like Lighthouse. Being able to see specifically which files load slowly in the real world and on real users’ devices is amazing from an optimization standpoint.</p>



<p>With that being said, these tools themselves carry a pretty heavy payload and can slow down your site by a double-digit percentage on their own. On their own they are not enough to improve the efficacy of your site or app – they need to be wielded by a scrappy marketer who can identify the issues and implement solutions to solve them. </p>



<h2>Visionary or Voyeur?</h2>



<p>While periodically I feel like a voyeur when using these tools, I do see the benefits and generally feel they outweigh the privacy concerns. In my experience the friction in implementing these tools generally comes from the engineering team who feels like they infringe on privacy rights. Are they right? Well, sort of. Out of the box these tools have the ability to record usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, and other sensitive information. That is where the implementation of the tool, both from a tech standpoint and from a configuration standpoint within the platform comes into play.  It is easy to block certain fields from recording into these tools, but generally, it has to be done manually.</p>



<p>FullStory blocks password and CC number by default but those can both be disabled by a less than honest marketer in order to get additional information about a customer. While I have never seen or heard that happening myself, it is certainly possible as these tools don’t require the obfuscation of some of the more sensitive data. </p>



<p>Some point to the feeling of “big brother” watching your users browse around on the website. Which is kind of what it is doing, but the blind spot here is that the marketer (me) generally doesn’t care who the user is – they just want to know what is getting in the way of the conversion, something session replay does better than any other tool out there at the moment. If the dataset were wiped of any personally identifiable information, it would still be useful to watch anonymized sessions move through a funnel and pinpoint friction.</p>



<div><p>Technically you’re also supposed to list the fact that you are using these types of programs within your Privacy Policy or EULA, and you’re even supposed to be able to toggle the script on or off within a “cookie bar” in order to totally comply with today’s regulations but I have yet to see that actually happen.</p><p>Additionally, who knows what these companies are doing with the data they have? Could they be mining it only to sell advice on optimizing funnels to the highest bidder? It really does allow for a lot of data and PII to cross into the unknown. How can someone even opt-out of this data collection if they wanted to? </p></div>



<h2>Are They Worth Using?</h2>



<p>The short answer is yes. On the surface you cant find a much more effective tool at optimizing the behavior on your website. The magic combo would be to combine session replay with a CRO tool like Optimizely or VWO to identify issues and then implement tests to counter them.</p>



<p>The longer answer depends on your conscious. In a time where people are increasingly worried about identity theft, facial recognition, and giving too much data to big tech companies, session replay does straddle the line between effective optimization tool and privacy nightmare. It’s worth evaluating the stance of your company on privacy and data security issues before implementing one of these tools.</p>

<p>The humble Casio F91W has been an iconic watch since it was first made in Japan back in 1989. Upon its release, it was sold for around $20 making it one of the world’s first affordable digital watches. Today, Casio still produces over 3 million of the F91W every year. The prevalence of this iconic timepiece through the years means it’s likely you’ve worn one at some point. If you have, then it’s probably the only thing you have in common with Osama bin Laden, Chechen militants, and Napoleon Dynamite. Congratulations!</p>



<p>As a kid in school, I personally remember being told off for talking in the back of the class. I had been caught excitedly telling my friends that I had just figured out what kind of watch the most wanted man on earth, Osama bin Laden, wears. As punishment, I was called up to answer the maths question on the board, at which I failed miserably. <em>”You need to focus on what matters! You can’t solve maths problems but you can tell everyone about the watches worn by terrorists?”</em> screamed my teacher. <a href="https://reaperfeed.com/about-reaper-feed/">Looking back</a>, I feel I prioritized the right kind of knowledge.</p>

<p>The Casio F91W was designed by Ryusuke Moriai which he described as “small, flat and simple”. The watch features a seven-segment numerical display on a grey LCD screen. Water-resistant, extremely durable and accurate to within 30 seconds a month, it’s a tried and tested piece of kit.</p>

<p>If there’s one thing that’s to be said for international terrorists, they know a thing or two about choosing reliable products for waging war. The F-91W joined the ranks of other terrorist accessories like the Kalashnikov and the Toyota technical because it’s cheap, solid, and reliable. Oh, and it also doubles as a bombmaking accessory which we’ll look into later.</p>



<h3><strong><em>A Terrorist Fashion Icon</em></strong></h3>



<p>Whilst Casio has advanced further into combat watches through its iconic Casio G-Shock range, the F91W has remained the true battlefield accessory throughout modern warfare. Aside from iconic weapons, the Casio F-91W is the only branded accessory that Osama bin Laden was ever seen wearing in the open. Al-Qaeda was reported to <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gitmo/prisoner/720.html">hand the watches out to recruits</a> at their terror training camps across Afghanistan and Pakistan throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. Thus, it was al-Qaeda and bin Laden who arguably started the terrorist trend surrounding the watch.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/obl_AP070817055372-1.jpg?w=696&amp;ssl=1" alt="Osama Bin Laden wearing Casio FW91" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/obl_AP070817055372-1.jpg?w=371&amp;ssl=1 371w, https://i1.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/obl_AP070817055372-1.jpg?resize=239%2C300&amp;ssl=1 239w, https://i1.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/obl_AP070817055372-1.jpg?resize=335%2C420&amp;ssl=1 335w" sizes="(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Osama bin Laden wearing the iconic F-91W.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>During the height of the War on Terror, it didn’t take long for the US government to spot the prevalence of the Casio F91W amongst terrorists. In 2011, Wikileaks released a document labeled the “Matrix of Threat Indicators for Enemy Combatants” which was intended to assist staff at Guantanamo decide which detainees are more likely to carry out suicide attacks. According to the document, owning an F-91W was the biggest giveaway of a serious terror suspect alongside ownership of a satellite phone, a radio transceiver, or large quantities of cash.</p>



<p>However, this wasn’t just paranoia. Statistics in other similar documents released by Wikileaks revealed that around a third of inmates being held at Guantanamo that were captured whilst wearing an F-91W had a known correlation with explosives. The F-91W watch came up almost 150 times in the piles of leaked <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gitmo/pdf/ym/us9ym-000840dp.pdf">Guantanamo prisoner assessments</a>. Ironically, four of the chaplains who worked at Guantanimo Bay also wore the watch.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5cc7041ab14bf43772045166.jpg?fit=696%2C348&amp;ssl=1" alt="Casio FW91 Guantanamo Bay" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5cc7041ab14bf43772045166.jpg?w=1100&amp;ssl=1 1100w, https://i1.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5cc7041ab14bf43772045166.jpg?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5cc7041ab14bf43772045166.jpg?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5cc7041ab14bf43772045166.jpg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5cc7041ab14bf43772045166.jpg?resize=696%2C348&amp;ssl=1 696w, https://i1.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5cc7041ab14bf43772045166.jpg?resize=1068%2C534&amp;ssl=1 1068w, https://i1.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5cc7041ab14bf43772045166.jpg?resize=840%2C420&amp;ssl=1 840w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"></figure>



<p>One of the detainees at Guantanamo was grilled over the prevalence of the watch amongst suspected terrorists. He claimed that the water-resistant feature of the F91W watch was handy due to the Islamic requirement for followers to wash up to their elbows before prayers. Innocent enough explanation, right? Well not really. Interrogators smelled a rat when another prisoner claimed the prevalence of the watch amongst Jihadi inmates was simply due to the built-in compass that helped them pray towards Mecca. However, there is no compass in the F91W.</p>



<p>Despite the fairly frosty relationship between the two, ISIS didn’t let it get in between their choice of a good wristwatch. The F-91W was a feature of various ISIS militants including Tunisian born Tariq al-Harzi who was a high ranking Emir of the Islamic State. It was also worn by Kevin Chassin who was a French-born Jihadist who went to Syria to join ISIS. He was subsequently utilized for his high propaganda value in ISIS videos. </p>

<p>However, the leader of ISIS Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi wasn’t so fond of the cheap Casio F91W. Instead, al-Baghdadi opted for a flashy watch that sparked debate over the exact model. The watch was spotted during his infamous speech in Mosul that declared the formation of the so-called Caliphate. It was believed to be either a Rolex or an Omega Seamaster, both of which run north of $3,000 and contradict the contents of his speech as well as his ideals.</p>



<p>It’s not just Jihadist terrorist groups that wear the watch. Introducing Subcomandante Marcos who, until recently, led the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) in Mexico. The photogenic insurgent leader was pictured in an iconic photo on horseback while smoking a pipe and wearing, you guessed it! </p>

<p>Of course, the watch is not only appreciated by the terrorists of the world but likewise by the people who combat them. Various fighting forces across the Middle East have been seen using the watch. Such as the Syrian Democratic Forces which is a coalition waging an anti-ISIS campaign across war-torn Syria.</p>



<h3><em><strong> How the Casio F91W Became a Bomb Makers Accessory</strong></em></h3>



<p>The Casio F91W is not only the terrorist’s timepiece of choice due to its ruggedness and reliability. Due to its long-lead timer, it also doubles as a bomb-making accessory for various terror groups around the world from Afghanistan to Chechnya. Deadly usage of the watch has been well documented through various case studies.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/photo-casio-f91w-is-a-favourite-of-cia-s-terrorist-arm-al-qaeeda-supposedly.jpg?resize=696%2C500&amp;ssl=1" alt="Casio FW91" width="696" height="500" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/photo-casio-f91w-is-a-favourite-of-cia-s-terrorist-arm-al-qaeeda-supposedly.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/photo-casio-f91w-is-a-favourite-of-cia-s-terrorist-arm-al-qaeeda-supposedly.jpg?resize=300%2C216&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/photo-casio-f91w-is-a-favourite-of-cia-s-terrorist-arm-al-qaeeda-supposedly.jpg?resize=585%2C420&amp;ssl=1 585w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>



<p>According to US intelligence officials, the watch doubles as a bomb timer as its alarm can be set beyond a 24-hour period. During the War on Terror, Pakistani ISI officials found more than 600 of the watches in a terrorist safe house in Karachi which led to a period of anybody being found wearing an F91W watch to be liable for arrest and questioning. However, with the watch being available for $4 dollars on Pakistani markets, simply possessing a Casio watch doesn’t prove anything and this tactic of arrest was soon dropped.</p>



<p>In September 1999, a series of bombs were detonated inside four Russian apartment buildings in the cities of Moscow, Volgodonsk, and Buinaksk. The blasts killed 367 people and injured over 1,000 others. Russian investigators concluded that the attackers had been trained in terror camps being run by Ibn al-Khattab inside Chechnya which had recently gained unstable independence following the First Chechen War.</p>

<p>Investigations carried out inside Chechnya discovered that the bombs used in the attacks were comprised of ammonium nitrate and aluminum powder, with plastic serving as an intermediate explosive. The detonator? A combination of a Krona battery and a Casio F-91W. </p>



<blockquote><p>“about a third of inmates at JTF-GTMO [the unit in charge of Guantanamo] who were captured wearing one of these watches had a known correlation with explosives”.</p><cite>– Prisoner evaluation sheet from Guantanamo.</cite></blockquote>



<p>In 1994, an al-Qaeda militant named Ramzi Yousef used the Casio F-91W as a 4-hour timer on the bomb he constructed in an airplane toilet of Philippine Airlines Flight 434. He proceeded to leave his deadly work under the seat before leaving the plane. It detonated on the next flight, killing a Japanese businessman named Haruki Ikegami who sat in Yousef’s seat. Thankfully, the bomb’s orientation caused the energy to be mostly absorbed by Ikegami. Thus other passengers and the plane were not catastrophically damaged.</p>



<p>So, to round off this article I feel it’s fitting to make a comparison between Ryusuke Moriai and Mikhail Kalashnikov. Just like when Kalashnikov designed the AK47 intended solely for the defense of his motherland, the innovative inventor Ryusuke Moriai could never have predicted that his creation would go on an unstoppable path of its own and be used for far more sinister purposes than ever intended. Mr. Moriai had unwittingly created a watch ideal for modern warfare.</p>

<p>I was hoping to find a profound statement from Casio on the watch being used for deadly means by some pretty evil people. I was looking for something similar to what Kalashnikov said about the violent impact of his life’s work. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/apr/28/casio-f-91w-watch-design-hipsters-al-qaida">The Guardian</a> approached the PR department for Casio hoping for a similar statement on the widespread use of the F-91W amongst global terrorists. But they just received a blunt email stating: “Casio is not making any further comment on the F-91W watch at this point in time.” Damn.</p>
